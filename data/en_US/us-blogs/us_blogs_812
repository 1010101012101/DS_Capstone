Shopping trip reason number two was that after a very stressful few years at work and an eight month absence on long term sick Mark left his old job in November and is starting up his own business, he moves into some premises tomorrow, hooray. He needed some new work clothes, hence part of the shopping trip. It was very successful and he got some very nice things, I have not seen him so happy and excited about going to work in a very, very long time. Even if it takes a while I know that if anyone can make it work he can, he is a very dedicated, hardworking person and I am very thankful for that.
We send you, as always, our love and support in your tremendous undertaking. Tomorrow we will speak again.

Looking at the third graph you can see NGDP decline, recovery and stagnation correlating closely with decline, (mild) recovery and stagnation in UK employment. The Bank of England controls the country’s printing presses and hence the nominal economy and responsibility for this depression lies with the Monetary Policy Committee for doing too little to avert it and with the Treasury for doing so little to force them to do more.
I want to share my knowledge with the world and learn from others too.
Opener “Alphabet Song” skips along on a tricky rhythmic foundation while the band seamlessly blends elongated keyboard drones and laser-focused guitar leads. Hunter bends syllables into pure wordless sound and the track moves with a purpose that a few of the tracks on Twin-Hand Movement failed to engage. Lead single “Brains” takes things even further in this more forceful direction. Behind a forward thrust reminiscent of mid-period Stereolab, the track bobs along with an intensity that Lower Dens have never fully courted before, and it’s their best standalone piece to date, catchy without leaning on predictable structural cues but chiseled enough to flash some real instrumental muscle and melodic intuition. In fact, they hit on such a good idea here that the track spills over into “Stem,” an even swifter epilogue that lets the listener bask in the soft-focus glow of the band’s nonchalantly confident attack. “Candy” inverts the formula slightly, still nodding along crisply but spacing things around the mix with slide guitar melodies stretching out behind Hunter’s most intelligible vocal hook. It may not embody the sweetness implied in its title, but “I never could let you down/ Couldn’t we make it if we tried” is about a forthright as Hunter allows herself to get in this full-band guise.
But the poem shows a familiarity with the Scripture – not only with a few verses, but with its great themes. If Mary composed “in haste,” she must have already had many of these thoughts firmly in her mind.

“Not when you have a flamethrower.”
It isn’t just that Masha won. It’s how she won. Considering that she was playing on clay against the WTA’s current dominant player, to serve the way she did was impressive. More importantly, she was brilliant off the ground. She had 31 winners to 13 unforced errors. With her style of aggressive play, even when she wins Masha can rack up the errors. If Sharapova has more than a 2 to 1 ratio of aces to double faults and winners to unforced errors, it is very difficult for anybody to beat her. And mentally, she beat the woman that defeated her in the Wimbledon final last year, Petra Kvitova, in the semis. She beat the woman that beat her in the Australian Open final this year, Vika. Add a quarterfinal victory, where she had to come back from match point down, over 2011 US Open winner Samantha Stosur and Masha defeated the last three WTA Major winners in a row at this tournament. Make no mistake, despite the need to appear impartial, the WTA celebrates when Masha wins. I think there will be a lot of celebrating this year.
I know some of the relationships predate their immigration. These friends were called krajan or krajani - countrymen or villagers. Stephen was born in 1882 Berezovo (also known as Berezna) in what was then the Maramoros district of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today it is in the Ukraine. Anna was born in 1895 in Prislup (also known as Kis Pereszlo) in what was then the Zemplen district of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Today it is in Slovakia.
But then again celebration may be a somewhat alien concept for the trappist order, following faithfully Saint Benedict's prescription for a life filled with "Ora et Labora"- prayer and work. So alien in fact that it seemed to have escaped the attention even of the Essen Christmas Beer Festival organizers, who aim to offer all Belgian Christmas beer available.
Here's the deal... a few months ago I decided I would close my blog, only to miss the heck out of blogging. =) I have decided to come back. Over the past couple of months, I realized how much my blog meant to me and served as a scrapbook for our family. I knew my blog served as a scrapbook for our family then, but reading back it really openned my eyes as to just how important it was. I am very sad that I don't have a scrapbook of things going on in our lives over the past few months. Shame on me for quiting. Super excited to be back. I'm sure there are a few that aren't happy about this as a couple of post ago... they let me know exactly how they felt. But it's my blog... I will keep it... and post what I want as I want... for ME. After all no one made them "follow" me and no one made them "read" my blog. I'm excited!!
Many Blessings,

We’ve been doing all these readings for my classes – how race affects learning; how gender affects learning; how poverty affects learning; how the education system affects learning… combine that with the statistics I’m getting from my Geography of Current Affairs course (approximately 400 million people in the world have malaria, 33% of the population of Swaziland have AIDS, and there are over 14 million AIDS orphans on the continent of Africa, to name a few of the grimmest), and sometimes I feel like “what’s the point?” Or even “I shouldn’t be teaching – I need to be doing something BIG to help the world.”
We ALL can totally know something is WRONG, and do it anyway. You are capable of it, even if you think you are not. Sorry if that’s news to you.

Last week I was on my back down week which I desperately needed. I had been building for a few weeks and needed to pull back. Despite my efforts to pick up the training slowly for the month of January I still ended up feeling beat down the first week of February. I kept the long runs on the shorter side but I did a bunch of other stuff. So last week I rested more than I needed to just to make sure and took it easy on the weekend. The timing was perfect because it was also the weekend of the Kaiser Half-Marathon. I showed up fully relaxed and ready to cheer. I didn't have to do any work like running to the race or running back - forget that! I like the race but it's not something I would run. Just too tough for me to go all out on a half-marathon with only a month of training under my belt since I take the holiday's off. I did do it once though just to say I had done it, it was a couple years back and it ended up being a PR effort at exactly 1:30. I cranked hard at that race, lack of training and holiday pounds be damned. I started out too fast and hung on for the last half. It hurt but I was glad for the PR yet regretted not breaking 1:30. Since I don't really run half-marathons that record may stay for awhile.
I decide to make the second part to my post before regarding on what happened in the 2011 National Basketball Association (NBA) Finals. Besides being a milestone to the newborn regime of the new dynasty as I wrote before, here are some of my highlights on this year Finals.

The “M3″ money supply includes everything in the “M2″ money supply plus all other CDs (large time deposits and institutional money market mutual fund balances), deposits of eurodollars and repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve does not keep track of M3 anymore, but according to ShadowStats.com it is currently somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 trillion dollars. But again, not all of this “money” actually “exists” either.

Though writing for the YA readership does allow me certain benefits I don’t get when writing for adults. For one, I have permission to write about melodrama. Not melodramatically, understand, but about the huge drama that is a teen’s life. One friend who writes for teens as wells said she enjoys writing “first experiences,” too.
There are two ways to view the Gnostic myths as potent metaphors: one inner and one outer. The inner way is to see the Gnostic cosmology as a visionary description of the hurdles one must leap in meditation. In trying to ascend to a contemplative state of pure consciousness, one must move beyond the incessant activity of the mind (the Demiurge), and past one’s fears and compulsions (the Archons), before one can arrive at a consciousness beyond time and space (the Pleroma). The successful achievement of this gnosis while still “in the body” prepares one for the similar passage that one’s consciousness must take after death.
They are "Luke" and "Dillon."

David didn’t win because he was especially brave, or because sometimes in true Hollywood fashion the little guy can beat the big guy, or because he got lucky, or even because a big sword is no match for a short-range ballistic weapon. He won because in the Biblical story there was a right side and a wrong side, and David was on the right side. All of Goliath’s size and strength were in fact irrelevant to the outcome of the fight, because Goliath was on the wrong side. And in real life, Ebsco’s market position and its profits and its assets ultimately have no bearing on this fight, because Ebsco too is on the wrong side.
In order to speed up some situations or combats, I may request that players submit a plan and a few dice rolls rather than dragging every such situation out for weeks. I would play out these situations and post the results. If the encounter begins to go bad or seems too far removed from the players’ posted plans I will pause it and post the situation as the next turn.

But subsidized corn ethanol gets the first prize for policy madness. It not only damages the environment, soaks up the water from mid-west aquifers, scuttles set asides for soil conservation, but its net energy equation qualifies for collective insanity on Capitol Hill. To produce a gallon of ethanol from corn requires almost as much energy (mostly coal burning) as it produces.

Today I was to take a 6 am bus to the airport on the way to visit Tibet. But alas, the tour operator didn't tell me they needed my chinese visa three weeks in advance in order to get the special permit required to go there. They said they needed it, but not that there was this strict deadline, and naturally I procrastinated in getting everything done, and didn't have my visa anything near like 3 weeks in advance. So TIbet is off. Instead, I've arranged to visit the Zhangjiajie national forest area, and we don't leave until 5. I may relate the hell of getting this arranged later, but for now let's look around Guangzhou.
I took a couple shots around the house to show my friend how I'm displaying the photographs that she took of the kiddos. I wanted to include those shots because they are actually two of my favorite displays in my house. ((smile))

"I think there's a poison in you which has nothing to do with being a vampire," Nina tells Mitchell halfway through the season, and the third season, in which Mitchell does not drink a single drop of blood but nevertheless does so much damage, seems dedicated to exposing that poison, the core of emptiness in Mitchell's heart. Like Dexter, Mitchell is a sociopath whose few meaningful relationships mask a fundamental inability to grasp that other people are real, but unlike Dexter, he isn't content to think of himself as a monster. Throughout the season we see Mitchell make up stories, narratives of his life in which he is the tragic, and ultimately blameless, hero. But, like the stories that Mitchell spins for George and Annie when they start asking questions about the train murder, or for the police when they do the same, these narratives keep changing to serve his interests, which ultimately exposes their hollowness. Mitchell tells Lia that he wants to be punished, and at the beginning of the season he delights in declaring to other vampires the worthlessness of their race. But when he and Annie become romantically involved, the narrative changes. Now Mitchell must spare Annie the heartbreak of knowing what he's done, and his efforts to stay alive are consecrated by her goodness and the purity of their love. When Annie begins to investigate the train murders and urges Mitchell to help the police catch the vampires responsible, he tells her that to reveal the existence of the supernatural to humanity would spark an all-out war that humans are bound to lose. Staying out of prison thus becomes an act of heroism. But when Mitchell is arrested, he begs Annie to break him out by claiming that he's the underdog--the terrified, uncomprehending humans are bound to kill him. When Lia asks Mitchell why he didn't kill himself upon becoming a vampire, he tells her that he wasn't going to let "it"--the vampire--win, and it's obvious that he thinks himself brave for this choice. A few episodes later, trying to persuade Herrick to feed, Mitchell paints giving into hunger as the brave act. By the time Mitchell, at the end of the season, comes to understand himself fully and asks George to kill him, thus ending the cycle of death, we as well as the characters have heard so many of his stories that we can recognize this request--earnest and genuinely remorseful as it clearly is--as yet another of Mitchell's attempts to cast himself as the tragic hero of an angsty story. His heroic death is therefore tinged with the same narcissism that had guided his life.

18 April was Independence Day and some people chose to celebrate it in the stadium to hear the President speak and watch a soccer match. The President got my attention when he spoke of political violence, a problem whose existence and extent ZANU PF has, in the past, denied. To hear the leader of the party publicly acknowledge that it was wrong was a balm to my heart. Yes, we can never erase the pain we felt, nor the homes we lost, neither will it bring back the loved ones who perished but the first step to any recovery is to admit that there is a problem.And to Zimbabwe the admission is that political violence occurred-no doubt- and a lot of lives were destroyed.

There is a stylistic, and (after this record) musical link between Codeine and one of this blog's other favorite set of acts, the Bitch Magnet/Seam axis. BM/Seam fellow Sooyoung Park gifted this record's "New Year's" to Codeine several years before one of his own bands recorded it (Seam did so in 1993 on the Headsparks LP), and not only does Codeine thank the Bitch Magnet folks in the credits, their next record (an EP not blogged here, though I may in the future) featured BM's Jon Fine and part-time BM David Grubbs in various guesting roles.

Second reason is a trip to Borough Market, a renowned food market. Haven’t been for a few years. I recall the first time we went when middle daughter and husband lived in Westminster. There was a delicious looking cake for sale, already cut into 6 slices and it was £4. Reasonably expensive back then compared with your average supermarket type fancy sponge cake – we must be talking at least ten years ago now, but it looked like a good buy. So she said she would take it. Guy on the counter boxed it up in a really smart box, ribbon around the outside then in a fancy carrier bag and asked her for £24. It was actually £4 PER SLICE!!! After all the trouble he had gone to she didn’t like to say she didn’t want it after all. Still laugh about it now. It did taste nice though – but she only let us have one piece each!

Mondays are my weigh in day and I'm pleased to say I'm down another kilo to 91kg. I'm stoked but not surprised. The last week, since my first fill, have been difficult days with the band. I've been massively restricted and have experienced a lot of discomfort eating and drinking almost anything and everything. Either the 4mls I now have in my band was a lot to get started on or I did some damage that first day post fill by eating solid food which got stuck and therefore caused everything to swell down there. Either way, I've eaten very little since my weigh in last week.
Happy New Year, everybody!
“Bye, Henry,” I say.
Something doesn't add up. Oh, right, it's the idea that we can make up a budget deficit of over a trillion dollars by cutting spending. Our total budget is just shy of 4 trillion, so the idea of cutting essentially one fourth of that seems ludicrous. This is the federal government we're talking about. Sure, there are several places where cuts are not only needed, but probably necessary, but that still does not mean that we can possibly make up the deficit simply by cutting out one fourth of all government expenditures.

Mr Sheridan asked about notebooks found in Mr Mulcaire’s home by the police which had details of Mr Sheridan’s name, address, mobile telephone number and PIN codes. Mr Sheridan asked DCS Williams about a name, written in the corner and asked if this could be “Greg.” DCS Williams agreed that it could. Mr Sheridan asked if the police had investigated the possibility that this referred to Greg Miskiw. The witness said he had not and again insisted he had gone as far in “pursuing” the News of the World as the law allowed.

The Green Sprout Baby line of diapers includes 5 size options to find the optimum fit for your baby (see chart below). The EVO and the ML (Medium Long) are essentially the same, but the EVO has some great added features. The EVO can accommodate smaller babies (6 lbs and up) as it has a snap down rise. It also has 3 hip snaps to prevent wing droopage. The EVO can work like a one size diaper for most babies. The EVO also offers a snap flap for the third snap when baby doesn't need it any longer. The flap makes it so the male end of the snap does not dig into babies skin when wearing.
For millionaire Ross Sterling, one of the founders of Humble Oil (now known as Exxon), the move into the Governor’s Mansion was something of a let-down, as he owned a 34-room, 21,000 square foot home in Morgan’s Point, that was at the time of its construction the largest house in Texas. The story goes he wanted his mansion to look like the White House, so he handed his architect, Alfred C. Finn (who later designed the San Jacinto Monument) a $20 bill, flipped it over, and pointing to the picture on the back, said, “Build me that!”

Here in Bath, we know him mainly as a great entrepreneur who transformed the city: he had a vision of how the city could look if it were to be rebuilt. To this end, he opened a quarry on the downs on the southern side of the city and built a sort of tram/railway to bring the stone down. He built a show home (now Prior Park College) to advertise the wonderful mellow Bath stone and sure enough, the city was rebuilt. The honey-coloured Georgian buildings are one of the features that make Bath so popular as a city to live in and as a tourist attraction.

About my charges, MB’s job, and so forth. N then confronted MB and told her what she had done. She told her everything that she had told me - all but one thing. MB was not happy and couldn’t speak to this friend for several days.

In the end Garrow's story will be like those of other religious "prophets" to whom God has supposedly spoken: Outsiders will be able to point out inconsistencies, attack the veracity of the details, and question the validity of the events recounted. But believers in Jim's story will discount such problems, and insist that since such issues can't be totally disproved, they could be true. Thus, Garrow's story will be viewed as "a story told from a dream" by those who see it skeptically, but as the work of God by those who share Garrow's faith in "saving" children from China.

I wonder though how much Will’s obvious discomfort at the thought of them working in the same firm influences her decision. I actually like the Will-Callie pairing, Callie seems like a grown-up, albeit one with a baggage (her past cocaine addiction), unlike Will’s other relationships.

It’s important to remember that whatever is healthy for the body, also nourishes the brain and in turn preserves the memory too. Your memory can stay with you forever with the right combination of exercise, nutrition, meditation and reading for instance, honestly anything is possible.

Much of this has to do with the fact that complex adaptive networks, such as organisms, adapt to their environment, often described by evolutionary biologists as the organism’s ‘fitness landscape.’ Such a landscape indicates a mapping of a ‘fitness function,’ a mathematical consolidation of the qualities needed to be considered ‘fit’ in a given environment, and hence, to be more likely to survive.
Spring evenings in Australia can be quite cool and for an outdoor wedding and reception it's essential that you have something to cover up with. I found myself in a bit of a pickle selecting a summer weight jacket from my wardrobe to go with this dress. Then just before leaving for Oz this beaded and fringed devoré cape by Kite and Butterfly went on sale at My-Wardrobe. I'd been eyeing it for a while, seduced by the twin peacocks on the back and couldn't resist when it got reduced by fifty percent. It arrived the day before I left. I threw it on over the dress as an experiment and found the tones of pink in the flowers picked out the dress colour so into the suitcase it went.
If The Madman’s Daughter really were autobiographical in even the vaguest sense, I’d probably be locked away in an institution somewhere. I’ve never been involved in dark scientific experimentation (OK, I did participate in some psych studies in college, but that was just to earn money for beer). In real life, my dad is the most zen, calm, sane person I know. I mean, he’s a bookseller. The craziest scientific experimentation he would do is to move a book from sci-fi to mainstream fiction and see if anyone notices.
But was it enough? Am I doomed to mediocrity... and worse, actually ENJOYING it? What's this whole being-content thing? Ack. What a horrible word. I feel like the word 'Content' is me: 5 kilograms heavier, farting in my track pants, hair to my shoulders, with a beard breeding spiders.

The second verse of Bhāgavatam begins with dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavaḥ, “abandoning all selfish duties.” The concluding instruction in Bhagavad-Gītā is sarva-dharmān parityajya, “abandon all selfish duties.” And now the Bhāgavatam will give an extension or “sequel” to Mahābhārata. We cannot sidestep the fact that the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam expresses the penultimate culmination of Indian civilization and thought. It is the effort of Vyāsa in his full maturity.
I think this way of looking at genre works for the traditional genres as well. Mystery has murder and puzzles. Sci-fi has tech, speculation and world building (I'm not a connoisseur--please forgive my poor recipe). And each in turn has its subgenres (mystery, in particular, seems to have a million). Subgenres may rise and fall in popularity. They may even grow more prominent than the genre (as is often the case in YA). But if you look at the recipes, the commonalities become clear and so does the genre-ness.

Because of its importance to them, it's important to me. Ivey is a common nickname for a 4th. Why I feel the need to justify this is absolutely ridiculous, but I felt the need to put it out there. I don't often explain my reasoning for making a decision for my family, so I'm surprised I'm doing it now.

Instead of running away from terror, we might as well send Hamas and its allies a message of our own: We’re here to stay. Can you talk about why you chose to leave England for Jerusalem, a radio show host asked me recently. I thought it would be easy. But the simple question got me thinking. I briefly considered the flippant answer that the weather’s better. The daughter of a neighbor who immigrated from New Caledonia a year ago jokes she moved to Israel because it was “too boring.” When pushed, however, she admits that anti-Semitism played a role. How much anti-Semitism can there be in a country with hardly any Jews? “Well, it’s more an anti-Israel sentiment,” she explains. It made me think of another reason to make aliya: Israel is probably the only place in the world where, when someone calls you a “Zionist” it’s a compliment and not an insult. What really brought me here, strangely enough, was terror. It’s a story I’ve told before. The first time I shared it was in 1996, following the double bombing of the No. 18 bus – a bus on which I still regularly travel. Then, too, it was close to Purim. Instead of mishloah manot (gifts of food for the holiday), people walked down the narrow streets of my neighborhood carrying meals to the mourners. On the morning of February 25, 1996, a suicide bomber blew himself up on a No. 18 traveling down Jaffa Road near the Jerusalem Central Bus Station. Twenty-six people were killed and 48 injured. A week later, on March 3, a bomber detonated an explosive belt on another No. 18 on Jaffa Road, killing 19 and wounding seven. The following week, when I boarded the bus, a passenger asked the driver: “Does this go as far as the Central Bus Station?” eliciting the response: “With God’s help.” It was the time the joke began to circulate among those waiting for the already notoriously unreliable line: “Why do the buses always come in pairs? Because they’re afraid to travel alone.” You might have to be a Jerusalemite to appreciate it. It might not be funny. The lethal attack on March 23 certainly raises questions about how the new light rail, when it finally starts operating, will handle security issues. ULTIMATELY THE answer to what brought me from a comfortable London suburb to a place where pioneering spirit was an asset lies in Germany – no, not what you think: the Munich massacre at the 1972 Olympic Games. I was 11, a competitive swimmer and in love with Mark Spitz. That was when I first understood one could die simply for being Jewish. Anywhere. “Don’t worry,” my mother had tried to reassure me as I watched events unfold on TV. “Mark Spitz is safe.” What about the British competitor from my own swimming club? She had not been in danger, my mother explained; she wasn’t a Jew. My young mind grappled to work out why an American super swimmer was at risk when the medal-winning member of my own team was not. Why just Israelis and Jews? And then suddenly I understood the connection. Israel wasn’t just an abstract name in my prayer book. It really existed – and more than anything else, I wanted to go there. Arab terror turned me into a Zionist – a peculiar victory, indeed. There is nothing rational behind my decision to move to Israel; it was an emotional pull. My Zionism was strengthened by every subsequent pointless death, and unfortunately, there were many: the massacre of children during a school trip in Ma’alot; the murders in Kiryat Shmona; the Yom Kippur War. Each one contributed to my desire to come to the Promised Land. The blast of terror blew me across the sea, carrying me home. For where else could I go? There’s no other country with which I have that blood bond. Ironically, during a recent trip to London I felt far less safe than in Jerusalem. Perhaps it’s always like that when you’re away from home, and London is definitely not my home any more. I found it unnerving to travel on trains and enter a shopping mall with my suitcase on wheelswithout a single security check. If nobody had looked to see what was inside my case, then no one had examined what anyone else was carrying either. It was only slightly more comforting to have my luggage pulled to pieces by security at Heathrow airport where I’d forgotten to declare a plastic bottle of moisturizing lotion. I can’t vouch for the overall security at the terminal, but I can testify that no one is going to get the chance to blow up a plane with 150 ml. of Boots moisturizer. It’s more politically correct than profiling, of course; I just hope it’s as effective. THE BOMBING in Jerusalem was loud. It brought back all sorts of memories and instincts that I’d prefer to forget – the “turn on the radio and call the family” standard operating procedure that was second nature during the years of terror. There was the sound of sirens, ongoing news reports, and finally that utterly Israeli response when a certain kind of song is played on the radio. Whenever you hear Chava Alberstein singing “we’re all a part of the living human tapestry,” it’s worth checking whether there’s been a tragedy. You might have thought that 50 mortar shells and rockets make a lot of noise , but obviously it depends where they fall. The barrage on the Negev on March 19 did not really reverberate. The rest of the the country picked up its head at the sound, sighed and got back to the Purim revelries. The world didn’t hear even the missiles, which let alone the sigh. The missiles came with a message: “Look at us! We’re still here!” hissed the projectiles launched byIslamic Jihad in Gaza. While some commentators remarked that the terrorists were exploiting the turmoil elsewhere in the Arab world to attack Israel, it seems more likely that it was an effort to reclaim the spotlight. It almost failed. Apparently, most of the world doesn’t much care if missiles are lobbed at Israel at an everincreasing rate in ever-widening concentric circles. What is more important is Israel’s response. “Israel has a right to defend itself,” ambassadors and foreign ministers proclaim. Just don’t ask them how. “Israel doesn’t just have the right to defend itself,” said Minister Limor Livnat in a radio interview. “It has an obligation.” We’ll probably be damned if we do and damned if we don’t. As Beersheba, Ashdod, Ashkelon and the Gaza border communities all came under fire, and Jerusalem licks its latest wound, a phrase I hadn’t heard for a long time bounced back into usage: “Shigrat herum.” It is a typically Israeli term: a “routine emergency.” Life is going to continue as usual – for an emergency, that is. Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat called for the planned international marathon to go ahead on March 25. Instead of running away from terror, we might as well send Hamas and its allies a message of our own: We’re here to stay. Or as Mayor Barkat put it at the scene of the attack: “Jerusalem will not stop running” – forward, that is.
Me, I've been fortunate to tie down all the above, so my searching is now directed to something more mundane but just as elusive: the most ethereal chocolate treats. A couple of weeks ago I posted another chocolate cookie, and I wondered if this recipe could come close or even surpass the perfection of the Jacques Torres Mudslide Cookies. I'm sure M. Torres wasn't losing any sleep because the Mudslide cookie is in a league of its own.
Anyway, please forgive me for my lack of exciting projects over the past few months and bear with me over the unexpected upcoming months. While I do feel ambitious this week I can't promise I'll feel the same way next week. Fair enough?

Miss Jenkins put her arm through mine linked as if we were best friends. “It’s hard the first day of school isn’t it?” I nodded scared if I spoke I’d say the wrong thing. “Still,” she carried on as she steered me inside the front wrought iron gate. “…it’s something we all have to do eventually. Change schools or move to a new town. All of this must be strange. “She waved her hand towards the school grounds with its gloomy buildings and drab surroundings not a tree in sight! Just concrete everywhere and long metal seats up against sand stone walls. The school had an eight foot high wrought iron fence all the way around it and no colour anywhere, it just it just blended into nothing.

He scheduled to have the transmission guy look at things after the weekend, then brought the trailer to park it at one of our borrowed homes -- his dear sister has a big house and a huge heart, and loves to have her nephews around. As we parked, shifting gears over and over, the transmission fluid started leaking, then gushed out. The road looked like an automotive murder scene, the reddish stuff splashed all over the place. We quickly finished parking, unhitched, and arranged for a tow to the shop.

There are too many humans that still think this financial and money system is right and will lAST FOREVER…it will not,it is heading for total collapse and with it widespread turmoil for mankind. Gaia and gods cleansing will be complete, the reality of our 3D world will collapse around us and only those of us that are on the road to redemption will have a chance of survival..it is very difficult to gauge time in the inner worlds and visions can sometimes be extremly hard to pinpoint time wise..but if I had to make an accurate guess I believe that within ten or so years, we will be living in a completely different society in every way..this current reality is rotten and infested with evil, and cannot last against the forces of light and purity that are stacked against it..there is a war going between the forces of light and purity and the forces of corruption and evil.

It was a sad coincidence that a co-worker had to put her own dog down in the morning for a similar reason. He was a rescue who had always been slightly aggressive towards other dogs, though never towards her in the several years she'd had him. He bit her while she was breaking up a fight between him and her other dog. It wasn't just an accidental nip though, as he bit her three times and started shaking her arm. She needed 11 stitches and decided he just wasn't safe or trustworthy any longer.

Daniel, Lucy’s fiancé, represented this masculine, controlling society. While I was initially sceptical about the almost villainous turns that his character took, I couldn’t help but care for Lucy and fear for the control that Daniel exerted over her life. It took me a while to understand that he wasn’t being a brainless menace, as some villains are, but simply taking advantage of the control that any man had over a woman in this period. This image was powerful but also understated. I have to say that it was the development of Daniel’s character that could have really influenced my impression of this novel. I’m not keen on characters who seem to be overtly villainous with no redeeming qualities, but Daniel wasn’t like this. His controlling character developed slowly, and the turn that it took at the end of the novel really endeared me to this book. Olivia didn’t slip into stereotyping, and also managed to teach some contemporary lessons about mental health.

He said it didn't hurt but I know that's because he was only thinking about Abby.

We mix our mind with virtue at three different levels: listening, contemplating and placement meditation. These three levels can simply be understood as “finding the right words and then making them sincere.” Enlightened beings have attained the state of perfect happiness all of the time. They then explain how they did it and encourage us to do the same. They specifically, with their words, explain the main minds we need to generate within ourselves, such as an appreciation of our precious human life, the wish to become free from all delusions, love, compassion and the wisdom realizing emptiness. Their words are not only a very precise reflection of the minds they have generated, but mixing our mind with them is the path itself to the same state.

Hunting Lila is a novel that promises so much, yet fails to deliver on almost every intellectual front and finally only barely passes as a flimsy, made purely for instant entertainment value, paranormal thriller. Yet again, the cat feels cheated out of a great adventure thriller. The elements to make it such really were there, except, once again, you get the almost formulaic focus on the romance part of a story. Moreover, the romance bit of this story is so cliché (and honestly disturbing) that it ruined the half-assed attempt at thriller-action. At more than one point the cat wondered whether Alderson – for who this is a debut novel – hadn’t just been told that paranormal and romance are what sells today, and pretty please put in lots of a gratuitous romance and swooning and wanting to get groped.

Alain Badiou reminded me of something I learned back when I was studying the French revolutions but had somehow forgotten, or rather I had lost the sense of just how significant the realization was, what it implied, and how it manifests as an economic slavery. The economy is merely a symptom of politics, I am not supposed to suppose that Marx may have had something there in his philosophy so I won’t, but politics is people living together and our society is bound by economics as a determiner of social status and function-ability. The rich are getting richer and the poor are paying for it, carrying a burden of debt and deprivation that grows more and more oppressive every day.

Later scientists refined these early ideas, usually at their own peril. Copernicus was the first to offer a mathematical model that put the sun rather than the earth at the center of the solar system. Galileo made the first known telescopic observations of sunspots. The Islamic astronomer Maghribi first estimated the sun’s size, and got it wrong only by half. For their troubles, all were teased mercilessly by their respective cultures.
OK so other than the weather what have I done all day? Oh yes the highlight of my day was… yes exactly there wasn’t much of a highlight of the day today, weather miserable, did the washing up, didn’t have pie for tea ‘cause I don’t like kidney and there was kidney with the steak in the pie, bleugh. I had cheesy mash and beans, how lovely, and now? Yes well now I have heartburn, typical, you have something you enjoy and you get the pain… what? NO PAIN NO GAIN? Pahhh!

We use wire ties to connect the chopsticks in the middle, making our axles.

My lenten sacrifice is going well though. I only ate meat on Sunday, and then I cooked it last night, and we're having knockoff Chipotle tonight, so meat again. Maybe Friday will be my other vegetarian day this week since they'll be leftovers for tomorrow's dinner I'm sure.

All over the world, people bear names that represent different things, some names represent personalities, landmarks or events, and they’re handed down from one generation to another. Many times, Christians have found themselves bearing names that contradict what they believe. Those names were handed to them by their forbears, and not many ever bothered to find out the meaning of those names to be sure they’re consistent with who we are today in Christ Jesus.

One thing about going to the laundry mat is the expense! Our laundry mat bill would run between $40 and $60+/week. Laundry mat prices vary incredibly from place to place. If we had hookups all the time on the road (and weren't worried about weight), we would have a w/d stacked set in the garage, but many times we dry camp.
We can see these signs in the increasing floods and droughts, feel it in a land that has been poisoned with pesticides, and those whose hearts are open may hear the cry of the world soul, of the spiritual being of our mother the earth. It is a cry of need and despair, that humanity who was supposed to be the guardian of the planet has forgotten its responsibility and instead desecrates and destroys the earth on a global scale.
My son came home from school yesterday (Valentine's Day) and, with an outstretched arm, handed me a long-stemmed white rose. There were two ribbons tied around the stem, a red ribbon and a violet ribbon. The rose hung it's head and looked worn and torn after a long day in his backpack at school. Honestly surprised, I hugged him and thanked him, I told him that I love him and I asked him to tell me all about the rose. He told me how the student council was selling roses for Valentine's Day, so he bought one and garnished its stem with the two ribbons used to wrap some chocolates that he bought at school. "Did you buy other roses to give to girls at school that you like?" I asked him. "No, I only had enough money to buy one rose, so I had to make up my mind who to give it to."

An eating disorder was supposed to make me happy. That’s what it promised. Yet I find myself sliding headlong into depression as it takes more & more away from me with every breath it takes. I’m on sick leave from work, I’m on forced leave from work because I have to be “well” to do my job. I’m likely going into inpatient treatment in the next 2 months. It kind of depends on a bed. It depends on me. & I’m not sure I really have the energy to fight for treatment & fight my illness; I fear it will result in me getting mixed up & fighting treatment.
I had an epiphany late last night as I drifted to sleep. I realized I have many books already finished, if only in my head. All I need to do is put them on paper.
I had a defective die last year. I first emailed CS on 25th Aug with photo evidence, and got a reply the next day. Now, the info had to be relayed to Julie because I am an international. I heard nothing back. I emailed again on 3rd Sept and I got a reply on the 7th Sept that they'll give Julie another nudge to see if there's an update. I still had no information on what I should do with this defective die. Reply from Julie finally on the 8th Sept to send the die back (why can't this have been done on day 1???). Now this happened just after Karen had her trouble with the "First Class Mail" return of her defective item so I was adequately informed just a normal envelope would do. But nothing again till 28th Sept when I sent another email to CS. I also asked about the $2 refund they said I'll get for the shipping of the defective die. Reply next day from Julie she was planning on sorting out faulty goods that day and that if my die had arrived by then, then she'll send a new one that day. Replacement arrived 11 Oct.

Looking at stackoverflow.com data for the last week we get a picture which is very different from the Tiobe index. The first thing that stands out is that Java, C#, Javascript and PHP feature much higher in the rankings than C. This should not be surprising. While C is suited to many tasks such as operating systems and device driver development the vast majority of code being churned out by Joe Developer is not written in C.

I do not write comedic scenes well. With comedy, a person must not only take note of those characteristics that define his subject, but he must exaggerate those qualities in order to achieve a humorous effect. I possess a very refined humor, one generally based on word manipulation (no bathroom humor for me), but I have difficulty bringing the situation to a “ridiculous” conclusion. I do not do exaggeration and distortion well. I suppose that the line between tragedy and comedy does truly run thin and indistinct.
But then again, it is a... pale film. There is a lot of paleness to it. Not quite a whiter shade, but it is, you know, pale. Which is not to say it is an insipid or wishy-washy movie. F'kn weird, yes.

On Saturday morning I had to admit defeat and tell hubby he was right…. I think I am better suited to sit up front and take the money than do all that running serving tables. Trust me, 54 years old is NOT the time to start serving tables unless you’ve done it for a LONG time or are in GREAT physical shape… neither of which is the case for me! To my chagrin I had to admit defeat and tell him that YES, he was correct…we WERE going to need to hire more servers and I’d be just as happy as a little clam to sit my big fat tookus and handle the money and greet the customers and help out serving if we got slammed. I am just smart enough to know when to yell “Uncle”!

And yet, despite the solid craftsmanship of the film, one thing has always kept Behold A Pale Horse from going down in history as the masterpiece it should have been: that damned ending. It stops the movie from taking off around the tracks, just when it’s gaining momentum.

Avantika stayed alone in a small apartment near her office. She was a loner at heart. Never made many friends at work. Had no social life. Since she had left India two years ago, to work in US, the only person she kept in touch was Bipin. They were seeing each other since their college days. If she talked to anyone about her life and about herself in the past seven years, it was Bipin. She was happy with her life. Bipin was at Charlotte, NC and was a very social guy. He had found a nice friend circle at Charlotte and was busy with his daily life. For last few months he was giving very less time to Avantika as his work load had increased. Most of the times he would be working or be with friends somewhere. It was easy for him to ignore her calls. And he did not regret it at all. Avantika looked at herself in the bathroom mirror. “I have tried calling him five times since the morning. Is he really ignoring me? Or is it just me? This is crazy.” She watched a movie till 2 o clock in the night. But she was waiting for a call from Bipin. She was angry. She wanted to yell at him when he called. From the corner of her eye, she was looking at her mobile, which would ring anytime and she would vent her anger at him. She slept off on the sofa watching the movie. Bipin did not call that night.

HAIKU REVIEW: Mirror reflections;
With ‘Dr. Enforcicle’ becoming more and more the average spy loadout, one wonders why it’s so popular. I mean, the Enforcer’s biggest downside is that you’re not using the Ambassador, a weapon while makes happy feeling blossom inside you as you plug your victims skull with your throbbing handcannon. It requires no skill to use and is a straight upgrade when partnered with the DR, but if you treat the spy like any other class and actually dodge instead of running straight at him, you’ll do fine. And yet the cries of OP IMBA resonate, but i’m not really here to talk about the Enboreser.
I went on my Chrysalis weekend as a sophomore in high school and teamed on leadership multiple times since. Last summer I teamed for the first time as an adult and was really affected by the outpouring of agape love I felt throughout the weekend (You can read more about that experience here). This time, however, I was in a much different role. I served as Head Adult Logistics and my weekend was consumed with making sure we were on time, that we were sticking to the schedule and ensuring everyone was where they needed to be at every second of the weekend. I left on Sunday emotionally, physically and mentally drained. I had put so much time into preparing for this weekend. Countless hours were spent organizing, planning and laying out every millisecond of that weekend. When it came time to go home on Sunday, I was ready. I was beyond ready. With only 10 hours of sleep throughout those four days, I was ready to go home, give my husband a kiss and call it a night.

I couldn’t help smiling as the psychiatrist sat frozen. This was the most interesting stuff I had given him in over a month and he wasn’t even bothering to write anything down. Maybe he was just too interested in what I was saying and forgot. Either that or he is just bad at his job. After a few minutes of an intense staring game I got annoyed. I can play staring games with my cat and it doesn’t cost me anything to do it.
Who can know God unless He reveals Himself to them? For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle? 1 Corinthians 14:8 (KJV) If the gospel you share is not pure, if it is unclear to those who don’t believe, how will they detect the urgency of the time? As Christians we are responsible for going far beyond the feel good principles taught by many well-meaning church goers. There is nothing sinful about having happiness, but we can’t exchange our desire to make others feel good for the only thing that can save them. Holiness is not about smiling and making folks feel good; although living right before God, especially once you’ve been redeemed from a world of sin and filthy wickedness will put a smile upon your face. The great commission calls believers to share the unadulterated truth and there is but One, Jesus Christ Himself. For, I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes–the Jew first and also the Gentile. Romans 1:16 (NLT) So shall we support diverse lifestyles propped up by the “feel good” gospel in order to promote one’s own agenda? We must share the “full gospel” and it’s not full, if it’s watered down with human reasoning.

Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak was defense minister at a time when Malaysia bought two Scorpene-class submarines from DCNS. Included in the transaction was a €114 million commission paid to Perimekar Sdn Bhd, a company owned by Najib’s close friend, Abdul Razak Baginda. The transaction has been mired in controversy since 2006, when Altantuya Shaariibuu, a party girl and translator ostensibly hired to help in the contract, was murdered after demanding US$500,000 from Razak Baginda, her jilted lover, for unspecified reasons. Razak Baginda was acquitted of her murder under unusual circumstances without having to provide a defense. Two of Najib’s police bodyguards were convicted and sentenced to death. They have appealed the verdict.

She's eating solid food like a champ (doing BLW). She just gums it to death before swallowing. It amazes me how fast everything is happening.

26 Brideshead Revisited – Evelyn Waugh*
Shoup’s is a compelling history replete with gun battles and shootouts. On one side there are rulers, most often their henchmen including military and other law enforcement, on the other side rebels, Native peoples to white union men. Recounting the scheming and out-and-out thievery that created the great names and wealth of California, he highlights rank-and-file resistance to exploitation. It’s messy history, but Shoup doesn’t shy away from illuminating the internal battles of the property-less, often drawn along the lines of white supremacy. Here are stories of chilling brutality and great sadness and, against these odds, tales of incredible daring, solidarity, and determination.

There is nothing fancy about this, despite the cool button (thanks Jase!). My goal, going forward, is simply to do more exercise. Any kind of exercise will do - I just need more of it! Most weeks, I hope to burn between 2800 and 3000 calories. Once a month, I'll have a lighter week where I only burn between 2200 and 2500 calories. Because those stats I've been working with averaged out to 30-week chunks, I'm going to try this for 30 weeks. Week 1 started this past Sunday, April 22nd. Week 30 will end on Saturday, November 17th. I hope to burn a weekly average of around 2700 calories by the end of the challenge, or ~81,000 calories total.

Many of the problems that are associated with the ageing process can be attributed to this loss of muscle tissue. With the decrease in lean muscle mass, a person often becomes less active and begins a habitual pattern of unhealthy eating. This in turn leads to chronic illnesses and frailty. The end result is a slow, sometimes painful, decline in the ability to live an active life.

The facts of the case are even more perplexing. It seems that the teenage girl ran away from home to live with her “boyfriend” for an unspecified period of time. One has to wonder how the older woman managed to pull off the hoax. To sustain such a deception while the two were cohabiting as lovers would have required a disguise worthy of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Unable to make head or tail of it, I gave my friend Lady Chuffington a call:
Strawberry smoothie is ready!!

Now I can move on, knowing that I have more to offer
"Alice?" the voice is familiar. It's the HR bitch from the company. "There's been an incident at Prospect, we've had to close the office but the project is continuing. We need someone to recruit a new team, are you interested?"
I’d go through Security, and I’d look back to see if she was still waiting there. Lawton’s a tiny airport – it’s sole purpose was to service Fort Sill, really… you can pretty much go through the entire security process and still see the other person on the other side… but there came a point where you had to turn a corner and sit down in this tiny waiting area that seated about 25 people, max. (The planes that flew to/from Lawton were twin propeller planes – very small.)
Yeah that's me about 59 years ago.
But a heavy police presence hindered access to the city centre, including about 2,000 armed police deployed around the sealed-off square as a police helicopter buzzed low overhead.
The path took us to the other side of the pond, facing the back of the house and the lawn. I particularly liked the glass baubles, one of the few carefully placed garden ornaments set about the garden.

Today I weighed in at 133.8 lbs. I haven’t taken my measurements yet, but I’m sure they’re equally embarrassing.
But no more than 3 please.

Who’s to say that the wall clock is accurate? My desktop icon insistently begs to differ by a full four minutes. No matter how often I reset the confounded thing, back it jumps to its own silicon mediated timekeeping. Could always page the speaking clock- does that even still exist in this digital age?- but all our calls are monitored, so how incriminating might that look? I would be court-martialled and make no mistake. Padded shoulders lopped off with a letter opener. Probably my boss’s faux-jewel, imitation curved dagger brought back from an ersatz Turkish bazaar, as part of an authentic ‘taste of the Orient’ excursion. Not that I sport padded shoulders of course. I’m not one for power dressing capaciously enough to light up the national grid. Unlike some I could mention around here.
I'm so excited to share these bead embroidered earrings with you. I made these for my mom who's wearing a gorgeous pink chiffon dress. It has some beadwork on the asymmetrical handkerchief hem. She has a necklace I made for her already, but these earrings are the perfect finishing touch to her outfit.
So I called back. And after navigating layer upon layer upon layer of the phone system, I finally got a woman who said "NY State Liquor Authority." followed by absolute silence.

Everything that you see on the planet was once daydreamed. It then became “reality”. And I am not just talking about technology, art, buildings, religions, ideologies, countries… and other “human” constructed objects and ideas. Even the “physical” ground you walk on, the trees, flowers, animals, the planet, the entire universe, was once (and still is) but a dream dreamed in conscious awareness.
It’s good to see that Ramsey is getting back to his best and with Arsenal involved in many fixtures due to the fact that they are in every playable competition football has to offer, a return might be on the cards for young Rambo.
I’ve recently got back in touch with a very old friend, well her son found me on Facebook and tentatively asked are you..Y I think you know my mum…T, it was a bolt out of the blue as I’d been trying to find her on FriendsReunited and on FB, as I’ve learned she’s not social networker.
I feel like I am in a creative cave as I create sounds to produce songs in my music studio. For me, it is a fully engrossing process. A friend from Montreal is in from Toronto and asked me to come to his event this weekend. I would have loved to go, but said that if I were around people, I would open my mouth and symphonic sounds would emerge rather than words. I am in the world of sound!

Imagine this. You have a large city that is surrounded by sizeable towns and an airport. North of the city you have some of the largest working harbours and fishing ports in Scotland, to the south you have the road that takes you to the rest of the large cities in Scotland as well as the rest of the UK. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a road, a bypass if you will that allowed the communities surrounding the city and the freight from the north to have direct access to the south without having to deal with city centre snarl ups? Wouldn't it be nice to have a road that'll allow new industries to develop alongside and boost the area's economy?
so last night at 2:30 in the morning my brain wouldn't let me sleep. I seem to have insomnia of sorts lately or maybe its insomnia of the brain. It took everything in me not to login to blogger and let out a thousand thoughts. I just kept hearing my mom and her damn 24 hour rule, you know wait 24 hours before you send the awful email, pissed off text, etc. I am not even mad at anyone in particular just people in general. My dad for not being a dad and then dying. A friend for not seeing who I really am. Others, who seem to have judgement on everything I do yet spend very little time in my life. I get up and I get dressed just like everyone else. I do my best not to pass judgement on others in my life. Maybe I should do a better job at not passing judgement period. Maybe this is my karma, my payback. Its funny last night and for most of the day yesterday I kept hearing words in my head. Words that have been said to me over the past month from so called friends and my family. Its allot to take in sometimes, every ones thoughts and opinions on your life.

Every morning we are visited by this Cockatoo and his mate. We call them ‘The Henrys’. Yes, we name everything. Each morning, usually around 7 am, they fly down to the rafters, looking into our windows until they locate us. Sometimes we’re still in bed and they have no qualms about coming to our bedroom window to wake us. Once they locate us, they ‘chat’ politely, asking for breakfast. We happily hop up to take them a cup of seed and have a chat.
boscoe: oh, man. oh, man oh man oh man. i never knew such delectable items existed!
The problem lies with the fact that the product is not, in the beginning, physical, although in the end, with the help of agent and publisher it will become so. My primary products are ideas and creativity, which eventually result in a book. In the 'real world', almost every product we buy in the shops starts with a creative idea - sometimes big, sometimes small. Without James Dyson's creative and inventive mind, we would have no bagless vacuum cleaner. Without some nameless genius's creative input, we would have no Cadbury's Fruit and Nut Chocolate. You see where I'm going with this? Everything, yes everything, starts with an idea. Some work, some don't. That's why every writer will have a drawer (or, nowadays, computer folder) full of manuscripts that will never see the light of day.
For the colour key, I'm trying to use the colour names used by the sellers to avoid confusion and make it easy for anyone inspired by the beads to find the same nuance. I've also thought about adding small tips or ideas like "why not try and add some dark pink/rose as an accent, picking up the rose tones in the grape opal beads" or "this combo would look crisp with shiny silver or silver colour findings".
“You refuse to debunk my statements…” I have debunked nearly every single one of your statements past your original comment. Yes, it would probably be a cake walk to debunk you, but so what? For all I know, you have retyped and inserted your original questions into your later comments so that I would be more likely to respond to them. You could have done that, because I still have not read most of your original post and would probably not know. But no, you just keep whining about how I’m not responding to your arguments, when I am doing that right now.
2. If your spouse said, “All of our combined money will be kept in one account, and only I can dictate how it’s spent – and you have no right to see the statements ever again,” would you be okay with this? Would you be okay if he bought houses, cars and boats on your dime, mostly, completely disregarding things you need like clothing, medications and improvements to the house you actually reside in?

We closed the pub down at about 1:30 in the morning, a good two hours later than normal. The party continued down the road a bit at the hotel the group seemed to have filled to capacity. We were invited to join them back at the hotel bar, which was being kept open just for them. Killian, sweet as can be, waited to walk us down the dark road so we could find our way. We stayed a bit, me drinking a bottled water.

Circles arrived even earlier in 2007, with the Oliver’s Castle seven-arcs on April 15th. 2007 was famous for its ‘Om’ design of 07-07-07–at East Field. This remarkable formation began a trend in croppie thinking of assigning special meaning to specific numerical sequences: a simple form of numerology or gematria. That said, 2006 was a disappointment to many who waited until 21st May for the first sign in East Sussex. According to crop-prophet Freddy Silva, that year was atypical because it was jinxed by a high number of ‘hoax’ cropcircles. By contrast, it was famous for its first-time 3D-special effects formations. They have been entrancing us ever since.

I kind of went full circle. A little over a year ago, when everything sort of went down hill, I was scheduled to go to the dentist in my hometown. All the excitement from the first date with my partner made it impossible for me to contemplate it. I sat in the cafe downstairs with her and explained everything – she had already been through all this before in 2008, so she didn’t have to try and understand what I was talking about.

ASSEMBLING THE HAND PIES
Tonight was the latest inspirational nudge. This started a few months ago when I had the opportunity to watch a documentary on the Bohus Stickning. Further stimulation from other knitters on Ravelry led me to read "Poems of Color" from cover to cover tonight. I'm already planning to dye the fiber to match the number of colors and spin it to make one of these magical garments of my ancestors. I'm part Swedish and it felt natural to attempt one of these sweaters the more I read about it. The fact that the ladies responsible for creating these works of art held true to only using the finest materials in the finest gauge makes it even more desirable for me to attempt. I love the hand of a fine gauge knitted item. The patterns call for a 60/40 % Rambouillet & Angora blend. The idea of knitting an adult sweater on size 1,2, and 3 needles I think separates the weak at heart if the color work doesn't. I plan to knit a sample from the book Homespun Handknit called "Northern Lights". I will test the color choices that I plan to use and hopefully it will turn out to be a matching accessory for the eventual sweater. I have some high grade ultra merino and Cormo that may turn out to be the fiber depending on some test swatches. I feel lucky to have have so many choices of near skin soft fiber to chose from to make one of these stunning sweaters. It might just inspire me to make a second pattern in the fiber I don't chose for the first. I begin to question, do I make the whole sweater blended wool/angora or just the colorwork? The fiber is uber soft already and the angora is added to give the halo on the yoke and to soften the wool but when the wool is already soft, should I make the body out of blended fiber too? I guess the angora would even out any tension or short row blemishes in my technique. One downside to knitting such a fine gauge sweater. Usually I'm a stickler for being true to the pattern or technique but I already plan on using my own variation of colors so it is already not a true Bohus rather an inspired by Bohus Stickning. I don't plan on changing the color chart layout and I intend to keep the look so it will be easily recognizable as what inspired the design. For those of you who know the Bohus designs, imagine a "Purple Shimmer" or the "Large Lace Collar" in multiple hued mostly Purple, black and white tones over a white sweater body....
Law and policy relating to family planning in China do not remain certain and stable and that the uncertain and unstable law- and policy-making on population leave space for the state to exert its discretion over the provision of abortion services. As a result, women are put in a disadvantaged position from which they can be powerless to control both their reproductive bodies and their daily lives. At the beginning of the 1980s, a series of social changes and economic reforms ‘relaxed the control of national and local authorities over individuals and also reduced their ability to implement family-planning policies’. (Winckler, 2002) Therefore, compared to the methods of implementing the birth control policy in the first two decade of the post-Maoist era, the existing ones are less restrictive. The current government adopts more incentive-based strategies to encourage women to have a smaller family. For example, it gives single-child families some economic rewards, such as a monthly stipend, free obstetric care, increased maternity leave, priorities in education, health care for the child, housing welfare and retirement pensions. However, the government has not abandoned its attempts to use punishment to stop citizens from breaching the birth control policy. For instance, as mentioned above, couples have to pay fines for their ‘out-of-quota’ births. The more violent means used in the 1980s and the 1990s, such as coercive contraception and abortion, are to some degree replaced by incentives and comparatively softer punishments, such as fines. (Duan, 2005) Nevertheless, this does not mean that coerced abortions do not exist any more. Strategies used by family planning centres to reduce the local birth rate may vary from area to area. In some areas, the local family planning authorities can still force pregnant women who are not eligible for birth permission to abort in order to achieve their birth control targets.

I corresponded with John Storm Roberts quite a bit in the 90s, particularly in 1998 when Original Music was failing and about to cease its pioneering business. He was so passionate about the music and getting it out to as many people as possible, that I am confident he would endorse spreading the love here. This is the first CD I have posted, and I have to note that there are a few points in a couple of songs where Original Music's digital remastering is not perfect. Still, this is a great album, well worth listening to through a couple decades of wonderful music.

Thrilling news….at least to me. My fave rubber stamp guru, Fred B. Mullett, is venturing east this spring and will be making a stop in Connecticut. For those of you who are not familiar with Fred’s artistry using rubber stamps, using a few basic tools and some crazy simple techniques anyone can master, attendees walk away inspired to try something new and different. During his classes, which by the way, have a HUGE FUN FACTOR, he teaches his students how to easily create art worthy of framing or gracing the fronts of highly artistic greeting cards. These are not your mother’s rubber stamping classes so leave your ideas of “cute” at home. Prepare to have fun and walk out with a new and very different perspective on rubber stamping. Visit Fred’s site for more information. The link is in the sidebar for your viewing pleasure.

I'd love to be all original and witty today, but it appears that my brain is on vacation. You're likely to see it on an upcoming "Brains Gone Wild" video....topless, drunk, and holding a margarita. I just hope it doesn't get arrested.

“Okay, that’s very accurate.” He laughed. “But it makes me look dopey.” Nothing. I said nothing! “I like the jeans but I’ve decided I want to wear my Bears cap. And since I’m wearing my Bears cap, you can have me wearing my Bears T-shirt. I think that’s how I usually dress when I’m just hanging around, so let’s make that my avatar. Oh, and put me in work boots.

These brownies may look average enough, but their taste is out of this world. I'd even venture so far as to describe them as the Superman of the brownie world, masquerading as Clark Kent in ordinary appearance but delivering an extraordinary taste impact. And while a plate of brownies may not be as visually stunning as an elaborate cake, all I can say is that if Mrs. K had tried our browned butter brownies, she wouldn’t have known what had come over her.
In three years out of every four, man has the privilege of "popping the question," and the annoyance of sometimes having a plainspoken "no" for the reply. On the fourth year, woman may propose, if it so please her. A lady has the privilege in Leap Year of suggesting marriage between herself and a bachelor acquaintance. In the event of his refusing, the penalty is that the ungallant gentleman shall present the tender damsel with a new silk dress. There is a reservation, however, that the right to claim this penalty depends on the circumstance that when she propose, the damsel was the wearer of a scarlet petticoat, which (or a little of the lower portion of which) she must exhibit to the gentleman, the understood idea being that the silken dress shall cover the petticoat and thus assuage dire feminine indignation at the rejection of her offered hand.

So, moving on. I love this blog, I'm really proud of it. When I started it years ago, blogging was new. I was one of a handful of Montessori teachers blogging and it felt so exciting to be part of something important. I really felt that way. Also, I had a toddler and if I didn't write to all of you, I think like many moms of toddlers, I would have gone a little batty. Connecting with other moms was paramount to my existence.

In the pantheon of great shows cancelled before their time, only a select few garner exhibition in the main hall: My So-Called Life, Freaks and Geeks, Arrested Development...and Futurama. Matt Groening's paean to the grand clichés of science fiction elicited instant adoration from a minute but devoted audience, but its brilliance and significance were lost on studio execs expecting another out-of-the-box smash like The Simpsons. 20th Century Fox pulled the plug after four exceptional seasons, but the success of the rejuvenated Family Guy and the tireless appeals of the Futurama fanbase resulted in a trio of straight-to-DVD feature films released sequentially. The show's writers took advantage of the lack of constraints imposed by the 22-minute episodic format, crafting epic stories that dealt with everything from Fry's millennium-long love for Leela to a rip in the very fabric of the universe, but the show's diehard fans still bayed at the door for its return to TV. Who knows? Maybe they'll win. It worked for Stewie.

Once pitched outside A&F’s flagship store, demonstrators were greeted by hordes of press, both local and international, accumulated on the opposite pavement. Also in attendance was the Chief inspector of Savile Row Constabulary, who commented to one of the protestors: “In all honesty, this is the best dressed demonstration I have ever seen.” We hope the Chief Inspector will add his signature to our petition and help keep riff-raff off the Row.

Then, bliss -- the cool air of the lobby of the theater, and a glorious theater it is. An opera house that seats 2,000. I headed for the Womens Room where I stripped down, spritzed myself with water, and paper towel dried, praying my deodorant was still working. It was -- whew! I mean, Miss New Jersey with smelly armpits?! But this is probably more than you want to know.

When my Mum visited with a stash of all sorts of goodies for me, she included two Noggin the Nog books from the late 1960s-early 1970s. These books and TV cartoons are a delightful memory from my childhood, Oliver Postgate's work was so wonderful - I loved Pogle's Wood, The Clangers, Ivor the Engine, but Bagpuss and Noggin were my favourites.

He used to take 6 hour long classes on the Upanishads, where he first taught my guruji all the 3 bhasyas by the Acharya-traya – Sankara, Ramanuja and Madhwa. Then he would ask her for her views and then he would state his own position on the text being taught.
There was art, antiquities from Qing Dynasty of China, Middle East; nature dioramas of carved stones, etc. It’s located in Wilder Park one of four corners with each corner holding a museum. I visited to the park for this museum, I ended up walking around the park to see the small conservatory and outdoor sculpture. It was a nice surprise.
Since I already had my bike, I did not need to make any initial purchases. I do need to be cautious about the condition of my bike and make sure to perform preventative maintenance in order to avoid any problems while on the road. The only down fall i feel is that crossing busy roads can be dangerous. When im on my way home there is a lot more traffic out and can potentially be dangerous. I was crossing a road the other day and thought that the driver of the car I was passing in front of noticed me crossing. He was making a right turn on a red light and happened to be only looking left for a chance to turn. At the very same moment I was about to cross in front he began to move forward and happened to notice me as I maneuvered out of his path. By the time he slammed his breaks I was already pass the front of his car and I continued to ride home a little bit spooked. I now recognize the true risk involved between bikers, pedestrians, and automobiles. In the end I still feel strongly that the benefits of my PSP outweigh the disadvantages, as long as I take the right steps in ensuring I ride safely.

If you can visualize the spaces these two are operating in, you would know that their heads at one point in the video are only separated by about the six inches---the depth of the large vertical box. Though their heads are close, they are operating on two different levels. The boy kneeling is basically operating on the floor. The other boy is scooping from the table into the large hole of the box. They might as well be playing totally separate spaces. But wait. What you may not be able to visualize is that the boy scooping the pellets from the table and pouring them in the larger box is supplying the child who is kneeling with more pellets. In other words, one child is operating on the pellets and wondering where are they going, while the other one is counting on a continual supply of pellets. So they are connected even though they do not know it. It doesn't show in this video, but at times the children figured that out. That, in turn, changes the nature of the play and the nature of the communication between children. Pretty interesting, no?
We’ll add another couple boxes next year. The boys are excited about growing plants, about worms, and ladybugs (that’s a ladybug they’re checking out in the pouring rain). I’m sure this will be a great opportunity to discuss the botany we studied last year. We’ve already talked about history, chemistry and decomposition.
If you know a person is cheating on their spouse and getting away with it, do you have an ethical responsibility to tell the spouse? Or do you keep quiet, allowing them to continue a life of deception, becoming a part of that deception yourself?

I realize the symptoms will vary from individual to individual. But I’m wondering if they also vary by geography, country, gardening zone, etc. I can just barely fathom there are those unaffected by this syndrome, such as those that garden in a very mild climate.

The next day, I noticed my ice shanty was frozen to the ice. The weight of the snow on the ice or the atmospheric pressure pushes down on the ice and forces lake water up through the holes in the ice and freezes. After a couple of hours of cutting ice around the floor, I learned to lift the ice shanty off the ice, placing it on large chunks of fire wood.

AMuS suggests the wear on the splitter is limited to this front section of the plank, the splitter ‘bending’ to spread the wear and avoid infringing the rules on post-race plank thickness. (http://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/formel-1/f1-technik-exklusiv-red-bull-unterboden-illegal-4043971.html). Wear is evident on the picture (above) of Mark Webbers cars from Monza. This wear pattern, is backed up by a view of Vettels RB7 being craned off the track at Suzuka (not shown here), which also suggests the wear is focussed to the front 50cm of plank and not merely the leading edge where the FIA measure wear.

Place a maraschino cherry in the center of each pineapple ring, and secure both with a toothpick.

Make no mistake, the Establishment view us like dogs and the chipping of animals is but a step towards the real objective which is the chipping of people, complete with inbuilt GPS monitoring to finally destroy any vestige of freedom. Microchipped pets are more prone to cancer than those which are not chipped. The security given to pet owners if an animal goes missing is negligible and does not justify the expense or the damage to the pet's health.

It was the third full day of watching Twin Peaks when we cracked. I’m sorry, I will continue trying to complete the show, one at a time, with breathing space inbetween.

If you've read this far (and are unfamiliar with the original story), the Greek above translates roughly as "Bearing your shield, or on it." It's what Plutarch gives us in the Moralia as the instruction of the Spartan women to their husbands and sons as they march to war. I stoically made this declaration to Hopkins the night that he graduated from high school, following his farewell speech to me. Good woman of Sparta that I have always been, I will sit by my loom again and hope for the best.
She knew she should not have ignored him last night. But there was no other way out. She was not in the condition of speaking to anyone at that time. Besides she did not want to trouble him with her problems. Problems related to Shahzeb. Arham had been liberal enough to accept the fact that she would take time to move on. But accepting and dealing with it are two different things. What if he too reacted like other guys? What if he blamed her of cheating him? No. She could not involve Arham in this. She had to deal with this all alone. And with this she realized, that Shahzeb had once again managed to turn her world upside down.
But at this point, I’m starting to look inside me, and I’m not liking what I see. I don’t want to do anything. I’m stuck in this web, and I see the big fucking depression spider advancing on me, grinning as massively as possible.
We often get a few emails a week asking about stretching and what we recommend. This is the last site to be searching for those answers…Just ask yourself and reserve a few minutes throughout the week to perform the stretch you like. Stretching techniques are not book ends to a program but rather a way to live your daily life. The program today requires no stretching what so ever…Just make meticulous mental notes of your body during the walk and address them later if they don’t interfere with working out?

Thus seems to be the curious case of THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, a hodgepodge of cinematic clichés masquerading as some would-be satirical masterpiece that seems to be polarizing the horror faithful. Like a feeding tube placed in an emaciated patient, CABIN attempts to infuse much-needed nutrients into the horror genre – but ultimately just runs out the wrong end in a steaming pile of liquid crap.

The problem of forming DNA by sequencing nucleotides faces similar difficulties.

Buying the obligatory guidebook (£2 in the honesty box), I begin to explore. The many memorials are like bookmarks in the history of Lawford Hall, recording the families who were once Lords of the Manor. Lawford remained in the de Cokefield family until 1424, then during the Reformation ‘was forfeited to the Crown on the discovery of treasonable correspondence’ (so says the guidebook). Elizabeth I sold Lawford to Edward Waldegrave who, along with his wife Joan, is remembered by way of a carved marble memorial on the north wall of the chancel which depicts the Waldegraves facing each other kneeling in prayer. Also commemorated are the Dent family who bought the Hall in 1699 and four of whose daughters died of smallpox at a young age. One member of the Dent family who didn’t succumb, Catherine, married Edward Green; the Greens later sold the advowson of St Mary’s to St John’s College Cambridge which explains the memorials to Rev E K Green (Catherine and Edward’s son) and Rev Charles Merivale, both Fellows of that College and former rectors of St Mary’s. The Rev Merivale, who went on to be Dean of Ely Cathedral and was one of the founders of the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race, was responsible for the rebuilding of the church during his time as Rector.

Since she was fairly comfy I decided to head over to the office to see a few patients. I knew the patient would have the nurse call me when she needed me to be with her. About two hours later she was ready for me. The nurse had said that she didn't want to do anything like the tub or the birth ball. She was very opposed to moving, which was fine! I just sat with her. Finally, she seemed to be losing focus, crying instead. She asked me for something for the pain. I told her, let's check your cervix, if you are close then you just keep doing what you are doing. If not, then we'll discuss the options.

A real man will sometimes go out of his way to make sure the woman in his life is happy, and will stop at nothing to keep her that way; that’s how I am with my wife, and I’m more than happy to do it, and she doesn’t even ask for it. The funny thing about being a ‘real man’ is how many men think they are real men and really aren’t. There are a couple of guys I know and have known personally that think they are real men, but are anything but real men. Usually that happens with alpha males, not that all of them are like because they’re not, but typically that’s true. The typical alpha male I’m referring to treats a woman like she’s his property and he is above her; he controls her; gets mad if she talks to other guys; accuses her of cheating all the time; has friends over and tells her what to do; bosses her around when they’re over; is basically your typical overly jealous and controlling guy. In my personal opinion; alpha males are typically the most insecure men and they feel the need to dominate to feel good or highly of themselves. Now I’m not saying all of them are like that, but of the ones I’ve seen and known, a lot of them are. I can say I know some alpha males who aren’t that way, but I can count maybe two.
I have no doubt that God’s blessed me with experiences to share with others. It isn’t that I’m all that special, but my Lord in Heaven certainly is. But God even told Elijah in 1 Kings 17 to beat-feet it from where he was, hide east of the Jordan, and allow the ravens to feed him for a season.

Alexia fan art.
It's a lot of Chinese, a lot of Japanese and a lot of Korean. We looked at costumes from the V&A collection. We photographed them completely flat as garments. We printed these images on fabrics and then heat cut the fabric into contemporary clothes, by placing the shape of the kimonos and the dragon curls from China all in a different way so that sometimes the seam of the coat becomes the shape of the dress. We just completely replaced all the elements. That's what we wanted to obtain - the beauty of the fabrics but on contemporary clothes.

It also features two legendary Hollywood actors among the cast: Actors' Studio veteran Cameron Mitchell, as Jaimy's policeman father; and former teen heartthrob Troy Donahue, as the rich backer of Col. Hogan's mercenary operation. Putting aside the predictable and not particularly interesting question of why these two actors bothered to appear in this junk in the first place, I would like to point out that, though the role these actors play in Deadly Prey both amount to glorified cameos, both are given top billing in the opening credits! Not even Glenn Ford was granted that honor when he appeared in the 1981 slasher film Happy Birthday to Me! Mitchell and Donahue do have one scene together, in which Mitchell delivers a speech decrying Donahue and the rest of his rich, inhumane ilk before blowing him away; maybe David A. Prior found the prospect of putting these two famous actors together exciting, but unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot in that scene worth writing home about, other than the fact that Mitchell brings more convincing emotion to that scene than Ted Prior brings to any one line reading as the hero.

I've started up swapping with swap-bot again and really enjoying putting all the little packages together. I have a box full of FB's that need to find their way to a new destination - I've counted them and have at least 140 of them in a box next to me right now. Some are very nice...I may create a swap on Swap-bot for swapping madly large amounts of FB's.

When Gussie was just a pup of 10 weeks, we noticed he tripped up the stairs, a lot. He’s just a little pup we excused. AT 4 months he continued to trip up or down the stairs. He’s just excited, growing into his skin we opined. At 3 years and still tripping up and down the stairs, falling off the bed and bouncing into walls, we have run out of excuses. Gussie is no graceful Lassie. Not a dog for agility trials, unless there are points for falling off obstacles and getting stuck in the tunnels. Alas, Gussie was born a dog to be walked slowl, on a leash lest he hurt himself.

The festival of Phanes is in mid Spring, and is the most joyous of all festivals in Calabria. A child born on this day is said to be particularly blessed.

For two years Stormzone were on the road playing in Europe including support slots with Y&T, White Lion, Tesla, George Lynch, and LA Guns. They also achieved Festival dates such as Firefest (UK), Sweden Rock, Lorca Festival (Spain), Zrock (UK) and Raismesfest (France) before re-entering the studio in the summer of 2009 to record their second album.

Since I wrote that article two other stories involving police abuse have been brought to my attention.
I often joke that our chicken tractor is really a chicken playpen, a safe place for my girls to play without getting hurt or hurting something else. I can place the tractor in empty areas of the garden, and the chickens will weed it, till it, and fertilize it. The smaller mesh of the bird netting keeps the girls from eating nearby plants, and the top mesh keeps the neighborhood hawks from swooping in and carrying off my hens.
Here is what it looks like:
Other news - Katie finally lost her tooth last week. If you remember it first wiggled the night before school started and she hung on that thing for 49 days. Oh the trauma! And Kyle seems to be finally getting the idea that he has to stay on the field for the soccer game. He has moments where he really gets into it and goes after the ball and then the other 75% of the time he is wandering aimlessly or playing in the goal or chasing his friend Gavin. But he did stay on the field today.
When Malcolm first wrote for the paper Eden and I didn’t think he would last long, but he worked harder than any of my other writers to get his stuff together and make sure he improved. That’s rare. He’s more than a writer though, he’s another person that after this semester I trust with everything. Malcolm has become one of my best friends, I know he’s just as baffled by this as I am. Eden, Malcolm and I have been a little team since he got there, and I really couldn’t have hand-picked a better trio. He may be a cocky little boy, but he’s my cocky little boy.
And I love that game.
Considering finding the comparison of the evolution of the Jewish maḍhab, I think there are some things that need to be in place, before we can begin the comparison. First off, one of the reasons the various maḍâhib appeared was the internal split as well as the geographical distance between the centers. People became more focused on their local center than on the overall center. When do we see the same in Judaism? Another thing which needs to be in place, is the acknowledgment of the same basic sources. When talking about Islam the split in the legal sources is the Sunnah and the Imams, where the Shi’as don’t acknowledge the Sunni compilations of Hadith, so the Sunnis don’t acknowledge the Shi’a ditto as well as the status of the Imams. Within the Sunni maḍâhib the basic sources where agreed upon, as they were, I believe, in the case of the Shi’a maḍâhib.
Now read the following piece written by Vusi Mabaso. Here you see the opposite side of the spectrum. A person capable of thinking beyond the limitations others want to impose on him. It is a real pity that the views expressed here aren’t common amongst South Africans, regardless of race or background.

Jen and I are just amazed at how content he is with us; it’s like he has always known us. He is also really showing a true two year old nature. He is hearing “no” from us more than we would like, but some things he just can’t do… like digging through the garbage, touching the hot stove, or playing in the toilet. He has been sleeping pretty good and only got up at 4:40am once. He east almost anything we feed him without complaining, which is more than we can say about our other three darlings. The only issue we are having is how much energy a 2 year old has…. He is wearing us out since we are not spring chickens anymore.
And then the Head Guy--I assume he was the Head Guy, since he did the talking while the other two stood in the background looking grave--announced we need to tear out half our walls, ceilings, and flooring. As he went into great detail describing the parts of my house that are now melting into puddles around us and the potential for life-threatening mold and the possibility of asbestos, all I could think, in my cynical fashion, was "yeah, yeah...that's how you make your money, isn't it?"--until he got to the part where he said, "...and that room upstairs with all the...the, um...you know, where you do your...the room with all the yarn?" and I did the human equivalent of what my dogs do when I say the word "dinner." What about the room with all the yarn?!

My days are spent not only pondering my current home but preparing to move to my new one. Each new physical act of preparation calms my nerves. We can do this. It’s just a step at a time. I will arrive in Orlando on Tuesday May 15 at 6:45 and will be shuttled to an airport hotel. On Wednesday morning at 8:00 a.m, I will report to Vista Way (the original Disney apartment complex) where I spent the summer of 1989. I’m going to save most of the details for those of you looking forward to following our experiences in real-time. Lets just say that I’m praying for a quiet roommate in a quiet apartment complex. Will I get it? Who knows…….

Update: Eric Cantor, the GOP House whip, announces his intention to repeal "Obamacare piece by piece," blocking funding and the regulations to implement the health care law, some of which would require limiting money to the IRS, a good example of tearing down the house to kill a mouse under the floorboards.
There are as many different reasons for wanting to own a gun as there are guns to own. First, a gun can be a sporting tool. Target shooting is incorporated in many different Olympic competitions. Target shooting has always been very popular in the United States. On the sporting aspect of things, guns are also a vital part of hunting. Hunting, again, is a very popular pastime.

I gotta say, I love the rehearsal footage of Melissa Gilbert and Maks. Bitchy Maks is back and he’s frustrated that Melissa is forgetting the steps, that she’s not putting her legs together when she’s supposed to and that basically she’s being a normal human being who only has a week to learn a brand new choreographed dance. As the stress mounts up, Maks says, “It could be worse” to which Melissa replies, “I don’t think so, but how?”. Without missing a beat, Maks says, “You could have an ugly partner.” Oh Maks, we love you. During their performance, Melissa looks lovely in an emerald-green gown that sets off her skin and hair perfectly and I think she executes the dance wonderfully. Her scores aren’t as great as they should be, though. Smoky, who has changed into quite a nice sparkling black jacket that thankfully hides how tight his pants are, smiles fondly at Melissa and Maks.

In Manhattan, such restraints are lifted even before one gets in line because there are no lines: Central Park itself serves as the “theatre.” Performances begin at West 103rd Street on the lawn and utilizes footbridges, trees, rocks, benches and even The Audience as scenery. People can come as they are (even as they aren’t) via bikes, roller-blades or scooters (even dogs are allowed). Of course, it’s wheelchair and stroller (for fledgling Shakespearean aficionados) accessible.

Abortion is illegal. You cannot harm a child until they reach 13, when you can choose to have them ‘unwound’ (basically kill them and use they’re body parts to help other people) which is described as not killing the child exactly, as they live on through other people. Kinda. Unwinding is a common and accepted practice in this society. Connor is chosen to be unwound because he gets into too many fights, Risa isn’t good enough at playing piano in her foster home, and Lev is the 10th child of his family and you have to give away 10% of your possessions to the church. So Lev is a Tithe, one of the children who actually wants to be unwound. And then awesomeness ensues. Pure, amazing, mind-blowing awesomeness.
For many christian people it is difficult to live a holy life, and to grow in the Lord when you don’t find genuine people who desire to live for God and are not clickish. I find this environment to be very loving and open. I love that everyone is so funny, and light-hearted and for lack of a better word, real.

Describing Jónas composing a poem on Iceland’s birds with a youthful accomplice Sjón writes: “Láfi had begun the poem, the first three stanzas were his, but had run out of birds and inspiration by the time I turned up. As we walked from farm to farm we took to chanting the poem together. He recited the first verses, which he had knocked together with some skill, and I slid into the metre—slipped into like a tongue into the socket of a well-boiled sheep.”

But his heart-wrenching statements - before and afterward - whisper to wake up deaf ears. Wake up blind eyes. They call to every mortal, resonating with all who've felt the tension... the tension between our own sin that continues the brokenness and our honest desire to be different. Sin and surrender. Might this promise really be about changing our hearts rather than our circumstances? (Part of me doesn't want to believe this.)

Quite frankly, the Meanies wouldn't have sounded like the Meanies without the existence of a certain quartet of "brothers" hailing from Queens, NY. By the time these singles came out at the dawn of the Clinton-era, they were outdoing Joey, Johnny, and Dee Dee in colossal fashion, all while those three gents were still walking the Earth. In fact, some of the Meanies compositions rivaled the heaviness of the Ramones circa Leave Home. At one point during their '90s tenure, the Meanies featured two guitarists, which might account for their barreling, sonic blitzkrieg. Mouthpiece Link Meanie is the heart and soul of the group, possessing just the right set of lungs for punk rock this visceral and voracious. Sadly, in 2008 the Meanies tale was becoming shrouded in tragedy, with the separate passings of guitarists Tas and DD.
We were mesmerized by the enormous chocolate sculptures in the Patrick Roger boutique on Boulevard Saint-Germain and left with 34 euros of chocolate (sadly, not for us). Upon exit, the kind cashier offered samples. I picked up a green marbled orb, took a little bite, and my eyes widened as luscious caramel sauce oozed out. There was a kick of citrus in the truffle--I only wish I wasn't so caring, since I gave the rest away to Milos.

FINEMAN: This story is no longer, if it ever was, really about Wisconsin. It's about the power of unions and the Republicans' effort to destroy them. What they want to do here is to try, number one, to goad the people in Wisconsin into overreacting. The strategy for the Republicans is to portray Barack Obama and his allies as a sort of sixties style bunch of radicals out to upset American values. And they're going to try to force the president to come out and defend the workers in Wisconsin. He's been very quiet. They want 'em out there on the front lines.

Another typical event is the book talk. These I like for my nonfiction. I talk about my subject with people who care about it like I do. Libraries and museums are good venues for nonfiction talks. I used to do talks in front of clubs and organizations. I had to stop because I wasn't reaching readers. That's important in deciding to do any event.
Like anyone, I have my own area of interest. That’s not to say I don’t know a certain author’s name from one of those genres I find undesirable. I mean, names like David McCullough, Nora Roberts, Danielle Steel, Stephanie Meyer (etc.) pop up all the time and I recognize them. They are, after all, big names.

Specifically, I started this blog on March 27th, eight days after Konrath and Eisler published the first of their dialogues about self-publishing (which I think at some point got christened 'Be The Monkey', but I haven't looked into that too hard, out of fear). That's not a coincidence; the linked piece was the sum total of my motivation for deciding to self-publish.

Dec 1st – My bags weighed in at 49, 49, 47 & 46. And don’t EVEN think I didn’t kick myself for the 9 lbs I wasted. I worked all night trying to get them as close as possible without going over. Speaking of working all night – Mom & I filled orders for 50+ more necklaces from 3:30-5am.
In the new patterned paper I bought, I noticed how perfect it matched with my little Emma and her t-shirt. The patterned paper is from My Mind's Eye - Happy Go Lucky. I had also bought a new set of Nestabilities, well there at least new to me .. hehehe, called Floral Doily Motifs ... I love them! So I cut the largest doily in Hawaiian Shores card stock from Papertrey Ink. I then die cut a circle nestability to sit inside the doily. For some reason I decided to sponge Hibiscus Burst ink from PTI around the white circle and now wish that I hadn't. I just think it would have looked nicer if it were plain old white. Lesson learned I guess. I used my Curly Label punch from SU! and stamped it with versa mark chalk ink. It's the only ink that I have that matches perfectly with Hawaiian Shores. I also used some Prima flowers and baker's twine. I added one little pearl to the centre of the flower on Emma's t-shirt and then around the doily and that's pretty much it! Here is a close up ...
I realised she was telling me about maiden voyage of the Titanic, 100 years ago today but, for her, only three years before that moment. I asked if she knew what happened next, and she didn’t grasp what I was fishing for. She told me she and her father had something to eat and went home. And she knew from that day that the voyage to Australia would be safe, and so it had been.

Meanwhile, Lambert is fighting an unruly assassin (the worst kind of assassins are the unruly variety) in his hotel room while wearing a pair of red jeans (I do love red jeans on European men). Luckily, Soledad's Jane comes along just in time to shoot the bald killer in the head. Now, if you're one of those people who thinks Soledad Miranda might lose some of her chic appeal while doing something a mundane as disposing of an unwanted corpse, think again. If anything, Soledad somehow manages to increase her jauntiness while moving a dead body. It doesn't hurt that she is wearing a short black sequined dress with black nylons, as even the blandest of individuals will notice a slight upswing in their chicness while wearing an outfit like that.

His Holiness the Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. He frequently states that his life is guided by three major commitments: the promotion of basic human values or secular ethics in the interest of human happiness; the fostering of inter-religious harmony; and the welfare of the Tibetan people, focusing on the survival of their identity, culture and religion.
Finally, there’s the run-off presidential election in France, which could have enormous impact on Germany and Europe. From the moment the debt crisis began in 2008, the responsibility of fixing it has rested primarily on the German-French axis. Truth be told, President Sarkozy’s main responsibility has been to embrace the solutions coming from Berlin, giving them added legitimacy in the eyes of Europe and the rest of the world.
Yesterday, I had a wonderful chance to talk with my niece, Whitt, about this and a lot more and although the topics were pretty eclectic, it seemed a few were determined to stay with me long into the arms of Morpheus. So I wanted to put pen and ink to paper, so to speak, so that I could go back and picture one of the most beautiful and vivid of dreams I've had in a long, long time.

An undisclosed, though undoubtedly fairly small, amount of time later; Isle (the lovely Sandra Julien), and Antoine (Jean-Marie Durand), a young just-married couple, are on their way to Italy for their honeymoon. Along the way they intend to stop at the local castle and visit Isle’s two cousins (Jacques Robiolles and Michel Delahaye), who are her only still-living relatives, and who she hasn’t seen in years. When the couple asks directions in the village they are told that the two men are dead; but at the castle the two servants inform them that no, they aren’t dead at all, and that everything is prepared for the newlyweds.

The original code names for the two test bombs (two because they were experimenting with two different types of atomic bombs) were “Fat Man” and “Thin Man,” ostensibly for the Dashiell Hammett characters. “Thin Man” was later changed to “Little Boy” but “Fat Man” was retained. Despite the official explanation, scuttlebutt maintained that “Thin Man” was named for Oppenheimer and “Fat Man” was Groves, and the former was an homage but the latter was a studied insult, referring not only to Groves’ physicality but also to his fat-headedness.
In fact, the EWC may have all along been the brainchild of Dr. Bateson. Among the inventory of papers he left after his death in 1980, he had maintained a file on the EWC dating back 10 (ten) years before it was officially funded by the U.S. State Department and Congress in 1959-60.[65]

For the stamping, I did 2nd generational stamping by stamping off the ink first on a piece of scrap paper and then stamping onto the white panel. I did the same thing one more time, but turned the stamp ever so slightly. I didn't want the leaves to be as dark as the bird. Finally, I stamped the bird. Originally, I thought I would be coloring the bird, so I used Memento ink, but then I liked it exactly as it was.
There are some fantastic blogs out there, you guys! Many people made their posts easy, and some made their posts really intensive. All those interviews that Dierdra over at A Storybook World did! So much work went into each of those, and she also gave many of us her originally illustrated awards, thank you very much! I appreciate everybody who worked so hard to meet this challenge. I loved seeing what my "already friends" would come up with each day. If I start listing names, I'm sure to leave somebody out, so I won't try to do that tonight.
The idea of walking away from my home for any reason other than that it was no longer physically safe to stay here seems strange and almost silly to me. If I have stockpiled supplies, created work arounds for heat and power, developed a lifestyle focused on sustainability, AND have access to food, shelter, water, basic sanitation, and my best chance at creating a secure environment for my family, WHY WOULD I LEAVE?
However, I was delighted to see that an open air yuletide bar had been set up at the top of the High Street, selling German beers and various mulled wines... Now that DID appeal! The only thing is, they've set the whole thing up right next to the permanent High Street sign warning you can be fined £500 for drinking alcohol there! That's gotta affect business!
Political post for the politically driven Filipino. In Katangahan Republique, the government, the people, the culture, the traditions, and everything in between are beset by the creeping entropy of stupidity, mediocrity and sensationalism.

Yesterday I thought I was through with the graduation movie. I sat down to watch it and when I did I saw that for some reason the boys movie part was in low def and the girls were in hi def - as a result the boys movie was "eaten" in the rendering process and the result was garble. I was crushed. I had to cry. It was my fourth render. FOURTH! But even with school out, I still had people in my room.

And on Sunday, I had a nice luncheon with a friend who was visiting from the UK, and as soon as I got home, it was raining cats and dogs. Zeus was probably having one of its tantrums, as the sound of the thunder was soo strong that I had to unplug my modem, just in case. The last thing I need is a blown modem.

The question of whether Cate should be more to the fore was one I struggled with, and in earlier drafts she is much more present. I removed these sections as I felt Alice – and Smith – had such strong storylines and I was worried about distracting the reader. Maybe I was too heavy handed with my removals?
you ask why I don’t put my memories with others in the jar? Well, they aren’t memories..they’re just hangovers.

A young woman I was treating had, at a critical moment, a dream in which she was given a golden scarab. While she was telling me this dream, I sat with my back to the closed window. Suddenly I heard a noise behind me, like a gentle tapping. I turned round and saw a flying insect knocking against the window-pane from the outside. I opened the window and caught the creature in the air as it flew in. It was the nearest analogy to a golden scarab one finds in our latitudes, a scarabaeid beetle, the common rose-chafer (Cetonia aurata), which, contrary to its usual habits had evidently felt the urge to get into a dark room at this particular moment. I must admit that nothing like it ever happened to me before or since.

Toss a coin in! If you wished for an alluring shimmery deep blue with a hint of turquoise, Butter London heard you and answered with Bluey. From the Fall 2011 collection, Butter calls Bluey a "slightly dark metallic Peacock blue". Even though this color may look like you're staring down 100 feet into the clear sea, there's nothing watery about Bluey. Control was great = no pooling around the cuticles. The formula was a bit thin and I used three coats here, but because it's on the sheer side this color has some interesting layering potential.
Here is an idiot fisherman and his transportation out on the lake. I hope that is not one of my relatives.

The surgery went well. They had to remove the colon because of where the tumor was at. The surgeon didn’t see any other cancer in the nearby organs or lymph nodes. For that we are very thankful. They will still test to see what stage it is in and if any other treatment is necessary. It was a relief to know that it doesn’t seem to have spread. Plus, without a colon, cancer cannot reappear there. She is doing well and we are praying for a speedy recovery and a good report on the test results.
"Marked by sly wit and a certain old-fashioned jauntiness, this tale of three chums on a quest for indolence strikes many a wish-fulfillment fancy...Hartinger blends urban legend with the actual history of Tacoma’s routing of its Chinese community (author’s note included) to craft an irresistible setting (who wouldn’t want to explore lost tunnels under a city in search of treasure?), humorous episodes tinged with mild danger, and a light-hearted mystery"

‘Hi guys. Thanks for stopping by. We got a call from a member of the public who’d found Aimee slumped in the doorway looking distressed. He couldn’t get much sense out of her when he asked if everything was okay, so he called us. I’d put her at GCS fourteen. No sign of trauma or anything amiss in her obs but Aimee must have taken a bath in fairy dust or something guys because her pupils are like dinner plates. She’s off orbiting some alien world, freaking out, yeargh! No idea where she is. Completely suggestible. I asked her if she lived here and she said yes, but no-one knows her of course. No ID. I’d guess she was about twenty or so. Don’t know if I heard her name right, but she seems to respond to it. I think it’s just a case of hospital for safety until she splashes down again. Sorry guys. How’s your night been? Pretty crazy, if it’s anything like mine. I’ll bring her out.’

As Arik works against time, he begins to untangle the threads of his accident, which seem inextricably linked to what lies outside the protective walls of V1—a world where the caustic atmosphere and extreme heat make all forms of known life impossible. For its entire existence, Arik's generation has been expected to help solve the problems of colonization. But as Arik digs deeper and deeper, he discovers alarming truths about the planet that the Founders have kept hidden. With growing urgency and increasing peril, Arik finds himself on a journey that will push him to the limits of his intelligence and take him beyond the unimaginable.
Looking all colorful and lovely in the movie we couldn’t help but ask her who had done her styling for the movie. “Priyanjali. Isn’t she good?” she asks, ”That’s one of the first things that has come up from everyone. She has done a great job. I am wearing a mix but yes I am wearing a lot of Indian. Basically keeping in mind the Haryanvi culture…” Did she do any particular studying for her character? Like the culture, the background she comes from? “It was a very easy character. To be honest, Mini’s major traits are being spontaneous and sparky. Very normal, believable. If you see in the entire movie I am with very little make up or no make up. I just had to be in the character.”
This circle, no matter how small or how big, will become a network of friends old and new that commit to supporting each other and getting to be more than followers, but friends.
Stoppard’s play focuses on two of Hamlet‘s peripheral characters, his good friends in the opus, whose only “business” in the play is to deliver Hamlet to the sanctuary of the english king, along with a letter which, unknown to the prince, commands his death. The prince switches letters, resulting instead in the execution of the pair. This is all the action in Shakespeare’s play in which they are involved in. They barely register as characters, existing almost entirely to perform their task, crucial to the plot. In Stoppard’s work they are now the title characters, but they do not exist in the verisimilitude of “reality” of Hamlet, but as men trapped in a strange void who occasionally are called into action whenever characters from Hamlet appear on stage and their presence is needed. They then snap suddenly into their required roles and deliver their lines. The play is explicitly “meta”, a work that can only be taken as something outside our reality, literary characters puzzling over the strange nature of existing as characters. However, these meta concerns converge with our own in their existential questions. When Rosencrantz or Guildenstern demand answers for the puzzling universe they exist in, where their actions seemingly has no purpose, their death none either, their questions echo our own about our own lives. They are defined by their task, yet their task is seemingly meaningless, leading them only to their own doom.
I would hate it if I took it seriously but luckily, Code Geass had make itself clear that it is goofy since the episode where Norio Wakamoto appeared. Every time he appears on screen, I was reminded that this show is supposed to be over the top and ridiculous. So what did he did to remind the audience and convinced me that Code Geass is suppose to be a dumb little fun show? He, a man who is over 50 years old and a ruler who had convinced and conquered billions of population, told a 10 years old boy to fuck off and die!

We also delivered the first of our 45-minute introductions to TMS – “High Performance and the Team Management Wheel”. Designed to appeal to those who might be new to TMS, we explored individual, team and organisational issues, sharing tips and strategies for how the Team Management Profile could be used to address these challenges. An unexpected bonus was some of our accredited network joining in too – they found it a useful refresher as well as a great opportunity to think about new ways of promoting the tools.

Yes, I replied, every minute that I'm home. And that's the absolute truth. We moved into our "forever home" last spring, and it has become such a soft spot to land.

We talk a bit after this, and I realise that the previous night, this woman was more drunk than I had suspected. Her speech sounds a bit more reserved. She dresses fast. I give her some money. She asks for my number, wants to know where I live and shit. I give her non committal answers, she gets the drift and ceases and desists. But I give her my number though, she crams it on the first attempt, transfers it to her phone and calls me immediately. Now I have the number of another beautiful woman hehehehe…
Jack will bounce around the room, from me to a toy, back again. He did this reliably last night while we were at Family Dinner at my parents' house. But Gus was intent, caught up in his own world as usual. Until he came running over to me and planted a big kiss right on my lips. He told me "Mama kiss." Then he ran over to Moviedad and did the same thing. And then it was back to business as usual. He made the connections he needed.
As much as I love selling on Ebay, I also enjoy finding local networks to sell items through. In the past, I've mostly used Craigslist as a means for cash, but now I'm trying to extend my network.

One of them was provided by my employer to several thousand employees.

His peripheral vision is potent and detailed. If you ever ride in a bus next to McArthur, you will have that perpetual 'watched' sensation. When it is too much to handle and you turn to face him you will find McArthus is asleep. When you are certain he is asleep, he will gently inform you which Shakespearean line gave life to the title of the novel you are pretending to read. When you turn to say: "How did you ever?" - McArthur seems to be snoozing.
Also, we read in Hebrews 6:16-19 that:

Apartment leasing was more favorable, with the national vacancy rate now below 5 percent. Activity showed little signs of slowing during the first quarter, partly because of the relatively mild winter in the Northeast, said Reis. Net absorption, or the net change in occupied stock, remains strong with 36,488 units leasing up. Tight supply conditions with only 7,342 apartment units coming online in the first quarter are helping the performance of apartment properties around the nation. National asking and effective rents remain strong, with effective rents (asking rents net of concessions) increasing at its fastest rate since end-2007. Asking rents grew by 0.5 percent and effective increased by 0.9 percent in the first quarter. Reis expects effective rent growth to accelerate even more as vacancies tighten within the 4 percent band; with availability so scarce, landlords have little incentive to concessions.

For years, I stayed clear of the kitchen. I was klutzy, I burnt things, I had a deep-seated fear of frying. My ineptitude in that particular arena was fed by others’ mockery to the point I loathed cooking. Having to be in the kitchen to prepare dishes was akin to being forced to watch competitive ice dancing– torturous. Luckily I had parents, siblings, cafeteria workers, and fast food employees to hook me up with fresh, hot meals.

For superb developing, no one can beat the quality and service Richard Photo Lab. We love working with them.

So now the seed has been planted. It’s clear and obvious now that people want moe and cosplay. Large amount of people also couldn’t care much about animators since they are willing to fork up more money for AFA09 than in AFA08 even when there is a lack of industry insiders. People hyped up moe stuff, affiliated blogs that promotes AFA are mostly moe oriented. People are buying more dolls and figurines than dvds. People talk more about K-on and moe series than they talk about Aoi Bungaku. So in the end, what’s the result? A total event all relating to moe and cosplay.

The farmer asked, "What ya goin' to do with him?"
I know that I come across as arrogant and narcissistic but my self loathing is stronger than the two, and the arrogance is only affirmation that keeps the demons at bay. The self loathing is strong today. The self loathing is strong everyday, may the Farce be with me. The loathing does not fish for compliments, they never seem to assuage the void. It sustains itself by feeding on me. I wonder if this is where Stoker found his vampire.
It was only in the last year or so that I realised what it was after it turned up on a US compliation: Music Box Dancer by Frank Mills, a US Top Ten hit in 1979. It wasn't a hit here, but it's a tune we all know. Was it used in a TV series or something? Whatever, it always makes me feel rather emotional and I'm not sure why.
