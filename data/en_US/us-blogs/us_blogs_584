Many entertainment programs tend to be music and dance-based to keep the kids active and involved. Party entertainer Grace (of formerly Grace Kids) is as dynamic as they come. Just watching her leaping about tires me out, but that’s what the kids love … and what they need.
As fully documented in Dr Emil Besetzny's book Sphinx (1873), however, the most outstanding case must surely be the creation of ten living homunculi in a mere five weeks, accomplished by two Austrian alchemists from the late 16th Century - Count Johann Ferdinand von Kufstein and Abbé Geloni.

My ribbon is my favorite new ribbon at Really Reasonable Ribbon. I ADORE this Aqua Floral Satin ribbon. The picture really doesn't even do it justice. You need to have this ribbon!

Welcome back to Sunday Stealing which originated on WTIT: The Blog authored by Bud Weiser. Here we will steal all types of memes from every corner of the blogosphere. Our promise to you is that we will work hard to find the most interesting and intelligent memes. You may have heard of the expression, “honor amongst thieves”. In that age-old tradition, we also have our rules. First, we always credit the blog that we stole it from and we will “fess up” to the blog owner where we stole the meme. We also provide a link to the victim's post. (It's our way of saying "Thanks!") We do sometimes edit the original meme, usually to make it more relevant to our global players, to challenge our players, sometimes to select that meme's best questions, or simply to make it less repetitive from either this new meme or recently asked questions from a prior featured meme. Let's go!!!

It was hot, that’s all i remember. Like open the door grab me, pick me up and kiss me hot. I was used to scrawny guys (i have a weird taste in men). This was new, I forgot why I was even nervous about this in the first place. Things heated up quickly, by the time we got to my bedroom door most of our clothes were off. I like when men take control. I have weird rape fantasies. Maybe it’s because I’m constantly doing the seducing. The rest is a bit of a blur but I know we had sex twice and it was hot. Not the best sex i’ve ever had but it was hot cuz he was so much bigger than me. It seriously gets me going when a guy throws me around.

Having convinced the room that ‘blends’ weren’t all that scary after all and we wouldn’t be sipping shandies, the next concoction landed. You’ve all heard the expression, ‘some assembly required’? This was the beer version. Blend-your-own Faro. A small plate of ‘toffeed’ candi sugar and a glass of Cantillon Gueuze with a straw for mixing was a little daunting to some. The fact that the sugar was perhaps a bit too ‘set’ made it a bit more daunting. Persistence was recommended however, and those who stuck to the task were rewarded with a beautifully balanced drink of cheek-puckering tartness tempered with an underlying sweetness that replicated the original nicely.

If someone is getting more out of their art than this, they must be startled, fundamentally shocked by it, even years after first contact. They struggle with words when called to explain the deepest core of what art does to them and most importantly, when pressed to find these words, they non-standard, they weird, like poetry perhaps. They moved to introspection because of art, they alter themselves in their ingress?

My thinking is being challenged by reading Nietzsche too, as we’re studying him in Philosophy. He’s an odd man. When I started studying Philosophy, I didn’t think that Nietzsche would be so accessible. Compared to some of the brick I’ve leafed through, Nietzsche reads surprisingly easily.
We gave them the mother’s message and sent them on their way (although not before the hubster…imploding under the pressure of a stern admonition not to…helplessly blurted out to hurry because their mom was crying, which only made her son even more upset. He then tried to backtrack by calling after their swiftly receding backs, no, no, no, it was their dad crying, not their mom, but both the intended humor and the correction sailed right over their heads. I was just grateful she’d be gone by the time we got back.)

Before going through Customs, the wig was straightened and I was told what to say. Joe showed his passport and made his way toward the Range Rovers waiting outside.

I overheard the Customs Officer ask if she was from Canada.

Before I get to some winners, thought I would show you a quick photo of the 1st Starbucks location which is located at Pike's Place Market in Seattle, Washington. My family and I went up to Seattle for a wedding last summer so I insisted we visit the iconic place where it all started. The Starbucks at Pike's Place is the only Starbucks that has the original brown logo with the original mermaid art. It's quite small but cozy and very historical. There are gift cards that are exclusive to this location as well as some other fun collectible mugs for the Starbucks collector. That's my youngest daughter taking a peak at the Barista's working away in the original location. Our visit made for some fun memories.

Poor BB. He was so sad and he cried so much when we told him we’d have to give up going to Disney World this year. But we told him, promised him, swore to him that we would go again. Maybe not this year, but eventually we’d make it back. He’s a great kid and a he accepted the loss of our dream trip amazingly well. He accepted that we couldn’t go out to eat anymore, buy random books or even run to the store every couple of days like a pro. He helped me inventory our pantry and made a sign for the pantry door that says “Kitchen Shop…The Only Shop At Home!”

When 23-year-old Ash is thrust into the middle of Fallenwood’s power struggles, she is also forced to face her own inner battles. Life on Earth was hard enough on Ash, who is locked in grief for her stepfather. Now, the fate of Fallenwood rests on her shoulders. She must destroy the Great Crystal—the catalyst for all the land’s magic. As the kingdoms prepare for war, Ash must look inside to find the power to save the world, and herself.

In March 1941, Reuben James joined the convoy escort force established to promote the safe arrival of war materials to Britain. This escort force guarded convoys as far as Iceland, where they became the responsibility of British escorts. Based at Hvalfjordur, Iceland, she sailed from Argentia, Newfoundland, 23 October 1941, with four other destroyers to escort eastbound convoy HX-156. While escorting that convoy, at about 0525, on 31 October 1941, Reuben James was torpedoed by German submarine U-562. Her magazine exploded, and she sank quickly. Of the crew, 44 survived, and 115 died. Reuben James was the first U.S. Navy ship sunk by hostile action in World War II.

Just for fun I'm posting our trip looking back over the road miles so far while starting out with the rainbow here this evening in Pennsylvania after the short heavy cloudburst. It absolutely would not be my home here if we did not have a shower or two duriong our stay, good PA rain just as I remember it from childhood when I always tried to sneak off the porch or out the door to run through the thunder storms, attracted to the downpours and distressing my grandmother or mom, both of whom sought to keep me dry while explaining to me the dangers of thunder and lightning. My fascination continues today with living in the Midwest, although I do know not to get involved with lightning, I did outgrow that attraction, still I do enjoy watching a good downpour which I fancy as earth cleansing.

There is hardly any doubt that Jews have so enriched the European civilization and its American outpost, and in so many ways, that an analysis that dwells only on the debit column of the ledger, as MacDonald’s does, is skewed. Moreover, when this analysis ascribes a truly diabolical motive to that debit, and ignores other viable explanations, it’s not just a troubling bias but a deplorable falsification.

NOTE FROM FWH: The story has always been there is a shortage of child-bearing young women in China, and one of the reasons to invade the West is so Chinese men can interbreed with Western women in the USA, Canada and Europe. So why not just clone women for every lonely Chinese man? I suppose there would be no variety in that, but seeing that the Chinese are damn good at cheap mass-production of product, perhaps they could export their clones to lonely American men? Just a thought.

Every time I come across the MAV rider perched above the damage ceiling in Tehran Highway raining down kill after kill with the bravery of being safely out of range, every time I run into a squad of USAS frag round griefers I start to like this game a little bit less. Here’s the thing, because DICE announced they are going to patch these things MORE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING THEM. So that “little bit less” is starting to add up. There was an entire squad of Recon using their MAVs to try and roadkill people other day. AN ENTIRE SQUAD. And I’m pretty sure they are not balancing the MAV’s roadkill ability. I even contemplated my decision to buy BF3 over MW3 the other day.

The competitive Farm to School Grant program was created through the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act (HHFKA) of 2010, or the Child Nutrition Act reauthorization. In 2009 and 2010, CFSC, with the National Farm to School Network and National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, worked tirelessly to win $40 million in mandatory funding for the new grants program. Beginning October 1, 2012, $5 million will be made available to USDA per year to fulfill the mandate of the HHFKA. USDA plans for the remaining $1.5 million this year are still under development.
It should also be said that the Central Bank’s statistics do not include overseas deposits at Irish banks – for example, Bank of Ireland has a joint venture with the Post Office in the UK which attracts more than €10bn of deposits. And the figures may include what the Dept of Finance calls “consolidation differences”. Having said that, these are the most accurate figures on deposits in Irish banks in Ireland. The Department of Finance publishes its own deposit figures each month and has this morning published its figures for March 2012 which echo the growth suggested by CBI, and show that retail deposits at the covered banks grew by €2.1bn in March 2012 to €149bn and the Department says that “half the increase” came from deposits in Ireland.
The phrase rang out brightly like a gunshot and jolted me. All at once, it dawned on me that I had the ability to choose my own life. I had felt trapped in the rat-race, felt compelled by society to live a life that I did not choose but in fact, I had chosen to let society take over my life. I was the one who held the last say and I had chosen wrongly all these years. However, the fact still stands that I am ultimately the creator of my own life. I can always choose my life.
I like it when you nag at me. I know I whine, and I become a huge grump, and throw mini tantrums that I regret about 7 seconds later, but in all honesty, I adore it when you nag at me. When you tell me to stop shopping. When you force me to take a break (while all I do is tell you to work, like the shrew that I am). When you get started on your life mission of ensuring that I eat, and how you force feed me, and throw your own tantrums, just so I eat. Just so you know, I secretly enjoy that. All of it.
Wake up with a praise this morning and not with your problem! If you give God some praises then therefore you have given Him your problem. Wake up this morning with a prayer and not your pain. For if you have already began to pray then you would not complain about your pain! Wake up with a song and stop giving God and everyone else a lying, bitter tongue. For if you are singing a song then the battle is already won. Glory to God! Wake up and jump for joy, because God is a healer and your comforter all day long. So continue to praise Him, say a prayer, jump for joy, and sang your song. Then you will find yourself trusting Him and not your problems and pains of today. You must continue to repeat this joy of the Lord everyday.Then you will find peace in Him in every way, no matter your current situation!

I am aware that my blog name seems pretty wanky. So I just wanted to offer some kind of explanation. Between the ages of 16-18 I was a pretty hardcore church-goer. I had some amazing experiences during this time, coupled with some others, whatever’s the opposite of amazing I guess? Erm, crap experiences? However, one of my most memorable experiences was when a South African prophetess visited my church. All skepticism aside, she was pretty awesome and “knew” so much about so many of us. I was having a particularly hard time at that point and she stood over me and said some stuff, lots was very accurate about specific things but the thing that has always stuck with me was
She has a deft way of combining commonsense with high ideals, though with a tendency to venerate aspects of the past in a way slightly out of sync with her literary enthusiasm for making things new. She soon realises that voting for Margaret Thatcher did not bring her what she wanted. “I did not realise then that when money becomes the core value, then education drives towards utility or that the life of the mind will not be counted as a good unless it produces measurable results.” And her defence of libraries – the places where she found herself – is apt in the current economic climate, where they feel like a soft target for councils strapped for cash. “It seems so easy now to destroy libraries – mainly by taking away all the books – and to say the books and libraries are not relevant to people’s lives. There’s a lot of talk about social breakdown and alienation, but how can it be otherwise when our ideas of progress remove the centres that did so much to keep people together?”
Early in 2007, I was asked to represent the mentoring ministry for wives I founded, Beautiful Womanhood, and lead a women’s conference in Uganda, Africa. My husband wasn’t sure if traveling to Africa was a good idea, so we committed it to prayer. While we were listening for an answer, I sensed God asking me to fast from spending, except for groceries, for thirty days. Sometimes you know that you’ve heard God’s voice because you’d never have come up with those words on your own. This was one of those times. I’d never heard of a fast from spending. Tom needed no convincing that a fast from spending came directly from the mouth of God. He still gets excited just thinking about it!

Tim Curry, Lesley Ann Warren, Christopher Lloyd, and one of my all-time favorites Madeline Kahn all make this an immensely entertaining and hilarious movie to watch from start to finish. Kahn is a bit more subdued in this role but she does have that great scene... "I hated her SO MUCH. It was... FLAMES... flames... on the side of my face... heaving... heaving breaths..."

From the moment we leave high school and college, we inherently and immediately become a walking marketing resource for the school of which we attended. By being able to provide a wealth of knowledge to prospective students and speak on behalf of our beloved alma maters, alumni are arguably one of the most influential and highly-respected aspects of the referral and decision-making process when it comes to selecting a school to attend – directly impacting your student recruitment efforts.
“I have given you my gift now. The gift of freedom from fear. Unshackle yourself from grief and believe that this life is just a stepping stone. This life is for learning. You have learnt how to love. Now learn how to life. I love you with all my heart, but you must step back into the world of the living now. Help people. Love people. Make mistakes, trip up every now and again. There will be times you feel lonely and unwanted. Times when you fail. But know i am here every step of the way because i live in your heart. There will be times of great happiness and success too.. and i will be there to rejoice with you.

Over the next 10 weeks myself and the other students will learn how to make a different jewellery item each week and also gain some business skills to enable us to price, market, promote and sell our goods should we wish to do so in the future. The course was free due to the business element and all we would need to pay for would be the materials we used in each class, which would not be more than £2.50 per week.

Susan Cain’s book will come as a great relief to introverts. They will find themselves saying out loud, “Yes! Yes!” They will be filled with a sense of vindication: finally someone understands them, and, more importantly, someone values them. They will find an answer to a question they might have asked themselves:

I will stock up on it for gifts for loved ones .. and for me .

Both she and Arai see home education as producing different but equally valid understandings of citizenship that emphasize the importance of family and participation in community.
I made the first batch with apricot preserves, dried apricots, walnuts and chocolate. I had leftover chocolate and apricot preserves so I used them and I used golden raisins, this time, with additional walnuts. Both were good. I am keeping far from them. I think I could demolish them, in one sitting.

It’s an obvious thing to say I know, but people of our age-group are dying off. Sure, a larger minority than usual are going to live into their late eighties and nineties, but few if any will have the energy, interest, credibility, bravery or memory by then to explain why The Strong One is nearly always a very bad idea. Our teachers were far too busy organising Under Twelve Progressive Rockers Against Heightism to bother teaching them much in the way of modern history – let alone the lessons that accrue from it. To be blunt, kids today know Hitler killed a lot of people in the Holocaust, but they have almost no idea how easily Adolf came to power, and how he created a totalitarian State without bending a single law in the Weimar Constitution. In Britain, we don’t even have a Constitution. I think it is a condemnation of contemporary culture that we need one – but boy, do we ever need one.
I visited an awesome blog/paper artist during National Scrapbook Day The Scrap Kitchen blog hop that I could not help but fall in love with her creative work. Iris Babao Uy is an inspired scrapbooker. I would highly recommend checking out her blog My White Space. Her work is incredible.
The proposal earned withering scorn from Dayton even before the GOP unveiled it. The Democratic governor called a news conference to blast Republican leaders after hearing third-hand of what he called “secret meetings” with the Vikings. He described their proposal as “fooling around” and demanded up-or-down House and Senate votes on the original plan.
Nobody knew how to do this. For 15 more years agencies struggled with client-side research departments (and their day-after recall tests, galvanic skin response tests, and all manner of moronic pseudo-science.) The agencies always lost.
"The Pale Colour of Beer. (Gambrinus; through Der Bierbrauer, 1900, 473).—The Pilsener beer has stimulated the demand for very pale beers, but a correct imitation of the slight greenish tint of Pilsener beer is a matter of some difficulty. The author has observed this greenish colour in four kinds of beer, namely, the Berlin "white beer," the Scotch export pale ale, the Pilsener and the Gratz beers. The first and fourth are prepared by top fermentation, " the second partly by top and partly by bottom," and the third by bottom fermentation.
So a whole set, including the scrapbook paper cost around $0.80.

But hey, I've got to hand it to Alder Brook for putting on a good post-race show, with some tasty rice and beans on hand and a reggae singer so cool, polished and smooth, he could probably turn a Megadeath cover into a feel-good song you could grove to. And since my wife Linda and I wanted to help a race sponsor out and we liked Alderbrook's wines, we picked up three bottles the day before the race with our race packets. (I must admit to having an alter-ego that likes a good glass of wine from time to time.)
I reference these two incidents as they both highlight Murphy's on-screen personality which he develops and really defines in the protagonist of the film, Axel Foley. The story of Beverly Hills Cop goes like this: Axel Foley is a streetwise, foul-mouthed detective from Detroit who heads down to the sunny, smog-infested streets of Los Angeles after one of his longtime friends comes to town for a visit. Foley is forced to take a leave of absence from work and follows the killer to, as you may have guessed, Beverly Hills. What happens next is a hilarious trek through the streets of Beverly Hills and L.A. that sees Foley get into all kinds of trouble including, but not limited to: a fight in a strip club, getting thrown through a glass window, getting arrested multiple times, being shot at and being chased at practically every turn. Short of robbing a liquor store, punching a hooker, and kicking a baby, Axel Foley does just about everything a guy can do to get into trouble in L.A.

The courier was operationally very secure. For example he would remove his cell phone battery so the cell phone could not have been used to track his movements to the compound. And think about the surveillance team and the ability to follow that man without getting caught. At any point along this operation if the courier saw the surveillance team, the operation would’ve been blown. I know from first-hand experience in the Ramzi Yousef case, the mastermind of the first World Trade Center bombing, that elements within the Pakistani ISI cannot be trusted so this is why the CIA decided to put together a unilateral operation once they had the lead on the courier. And the logistics, and the care and feeding and the backstop of what took place to get this team into country to surveil all the courier from many, many weeks before the bin Laden operation is probably the most brilliant CIA surveillance operation in quite some time.

I miss reading my favorite blogs. I miss emailing. I just don't feel like doing anything. Believe me I have a TON of topics that I could post about. I've tried some new products I wanted to share with you all, I got a cool gift I wanted to tell you about, a few things that bugged me over the shopping at various stores. And on and on my crazy brain is going. SO much to say! It's all in my brain - hopefully it will come out in type soon.
I guess I will start by telling you guys that are soon to follow me a few things about me.
My prayer for you today is that something in your own life gives you the same feeling. And if it's not there already, then I pray God will place something there for you.

So I was pleased to hear that a new Kosher-style delicatessen had opened in November of 2011 in nearby Allendale. Managed and owned by Steve Vaccari (who also owns Goldberg’s Bagels in Wyckoff) the 48-seat restaurant offers the traditional Jewish deli we all know and love with a few extra tweaks to fit modern tastes. Vaccari has also brought in a dream team of seasoned deli men with decades of combined experience in order to make it a quality operation.
Sure as hell isn’t the writing.
Although he was released from the Tower after a few weeks, he remained unwelcome at Court for three years, while the girl and her child were permanently banished from Court, and he and she were forbidden to see each other. Her uncle, a hotheaded young man, newly risen at Court and eager to win his spurs in battle with the recently displaced Royal favorite, challenged him in scornful terms to a duel. The Queen put a stop to that, but bad blood developed between the two parties, his and her uncle's, resulting in the same sort of bloody brawls in the streets of London that rang in the streets of his early poem between the Capulets and the Montagues. Men were killed on both sides over a period of two years until strict injunctions by the Queen to desist, with warnings of hell to pay if they did not, finally brought the turmoil to an end. He himself was seriously wounded in one street fight.
In the overgrown garden the bat-woman waits as Lucy approaches. As the two come together, a shriek like a woman's voice rends the air. Lucy cowers, but the bat-woman soothes her: "It's nothing.

Did Desai write it and CC other board members for spin control? Does collaboration like this violate Sunshine Laws? And if Desai is correct and the numbers can be easily explained, why did the board act in less than 24 hours?

Millennium: The last 1000 years of the earth’s 7000-year temporal existence, the Millennium can be seen as the Sabbath coming after the long week of mortal earth. Satan will be bound, and the righteous will come forth in the first resurrection before the start of the Millennium. Just like a normal Sabbath, the Millennium will be a busy time of getting kids ready for church and attending meetings, lots of meetings. This will also be the time to correct all the mistakes in the church’s genealogy records.

I know now where my passion lies, and where my ministry is. I don’t know exactly how God plans to use this long term, but my heart is for the orphans. Right now, I am planning on spending my spring break in Russian orphanages ministering to children. God has also shown me more and more that He is in control. I am recently engaged, and my fiancé shares the same passion for orphans that I do. I know this is just the beginning of God’s path, and I can’t wait to see where it leads.

With regard to skilled labour, is it 'left-wing' to poach the third world's most able citizens? Surely the most impoverished people need their doctors, engineers and entrepreneurs more than we do? The reality is that if the NHS paid its staff a decent wage, it wouldn't be dependent on foreign doctors and nurses in the first place! Is maintaining low taxes at the expense of the most desperate and poverty-stricken peoples in the world 'right-wing' or 'left-wing'?

Remove from the oven and let them set for more than 6 hours. Afterward, cut them into bars. I wrap my bars in cellophane individually and put them in a glass jar but they don’t stay long.

I picked up Beach Cruiser and Skinny Dip from Orly's new summer neon collection Feel The Vibe at Sally's yesterday.

Your passions will change. Your passion today may not be your passion tomorrow. You will change, and your passions will change you. You will find pieces of yourself you didn’t know you were missing. You’ll find them in the people that you meet, and the places that you live, and in experiences that touch you in unexpected ways. Life is long. It’s okay to let things go once you’ve learned what you need. You’re not abandoning them. They are a part of you now.

I found out about the feature only a few days before the event. The host was looking for poets/spoken word artists to perform. We shared a mutual friend, so after a few texts and a reading “audition” over the phone, I was in. I hadn’t read a piece in public for years, so once it was decision-making time, I was unsure. Each poet was going to have 20 minutes on stage. I’ve never even had a school presentation that was that long. I kept thinking how was I going to fill up 20 minutes if my pieces usually are a minute on average? Would I find enough in the archives? Would I have to write new material to fill out my performance?

And we wonder why people “snap” when they do. Why would someone, who seemingly has it all together, suddenly snap and act completely out of character? Could it be that the straw finally fell and really did break the camel’s back? What emotions were laying dormant within their “wall” that became activated by that one word, or one action that triggered a lifetime of restraint to unravel and beak free? The human brain is a wondrous puzzle that holds so many mysteries. One could argue that it is within our cellular structure to react in such a way, or even that it is a learned response. In both scenarios, I believe that the psychological reaction of “snapping” can be relieved by self expression and physical action.

Julia Blackburn's Thin Paths, hailed by the judges for its "engrossing, almost obsessive engagement with the history of an Italian mountain village", and Tim Robinson's Connemara make up the rest of this year's Ondaatje shortlist, but the recent novel that summons up the "spirit of a place" for me is The Shipping News. I read it while in Newfoundland and was consumed by Annie Proulx's evocation of this harsh, remote, stunning island, where travellers were "drawn by the cod, from the days when massed fish slowed ships on the drift for the passage to the Spice Isles", where "the only cities were of ice, bergs with cores of beryl, blue gems within white gems, that some said gave off an odour of almonds". But what would you choose?

There is no evidence of any serious disparity between the UK Patent Office and the European Patent Office (EPO) when dealing with inventive step. It appears that, bar some minor variations, the UK and EPO are seen to be broadly equivalent in the ‘level’ of inventive step applied. This is reassuring given that both offices examine patents under (essentially) the same law. On the other hand, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which operates under a different legal framework, was felt by many to require a lower level of inventive step. Interestingly the Scandinavian countries (which operate within the European system) were felt to be somewhat stricter than the either UK or the EPO.

Bake uncovered for about 12-15 minutes. The bread crumbs should be golden on top, and the fish will flake and be moist inside.

I can tell you that almost any problem in high school trigonometry can be solved in many different ways. The process can look different for some kids, and it does not imply he has "stumbled on some weird way." His way is not wrong just because it's not the teacher's way. All of the greatest mathematicians in history were so brilliant because they figured out new ways to look at problems.
People who are more affluent are more likely to be married.... and not only "married" but "happily married". While people who are near the bottom of the wage scale are more likely to be unmarried, due to the difficulty of finding a good potential life partner. Marriage is becoming more of a status symbol.... a sign of affluence in this country, rather than a covenant between two people (as it once was).

There is no denying that The Rolling Stones are excellent musicians, and this music is some of the finest from the genre, but given that The Stones toured for three months, the fact that only two concerts were recorded and used in this movie is a letdown.

So, I guess this is a belated Mother’s Day post, mostly because it is my mom who is the one who makes me want to enjoy running. Although she is in the latter half of her 50s, she is active, fit and looks nothing like a woman in her late 50s. She runs and for the most part enjoys it, but the big thing is that with each foot thump (this morning she described her run as being elephant-like, with the steps being more like thumps than gazelle like gracefulness) she is enjoying herself, and helping to keep her body and mind healthy.

I have a lot of different emotions running through my head these days and now that a date is set, I'm pretty much an emotional roller coaster....but I think I'll save that saga for another post. Let's just say though that in spite of my emotional turmoil, I'm really making the effort to enjoy these last two weeks before the babies arrive. It's difficult at times and with all the estrogen running through me you can probably imagine how particularly fragile I've been as of late. I am just so thankful to have such a wonderful husband in my life who is willing to deal with my emotional ups and downs. I'm also thankful for an amazingly supportive family and friends who never forget to remind just how much I'm being prayed for right now. I'm not entirely certain that I would make it through this process if it weren't for all the people who have supported me. I like to think I'm a super tough bitch, but deep down I'm really a super sensitive girl who would rather frolic in a field of bunny rabbits and butterflies than try to conquer the world. Sad, but the true, I guess. :)
The Book Of Human Skin may not be literature of the highest quality, but it is a fun roller-coaster ride of a read full of sensational elements and cliff-hangers that keep you turning the pages. My favourite characters were the two evil ones, Minguillo himself and the crazy nun, Sor Loreta. Whereas Minguillo knew he was committing evil acts and indeed revelled in it, Sor Loreta attempted to hide her evil deeds under the guise of religious fanaticism and a penchant for self-mutilation. She scourges, burns, cuts and otherwise disfigures herself as a mark of her devotion to God and flies into self-induced religious 'rages' where she punishes the other nuns for not living up to her expectations. She was such a fascinating character (did she know she was bad, or was she deluding even herself?) that I didn't want her sections of the book to end. I was even more fascinated to read the after-word and learn that some nuns at that time did indeed drink the pus of small-pox victims and have visions about licking the blood from the wounds of Jesus after his crucifixion. Creepy. And don't even get me started on the nun that would only break her fast for food covered in cat vomit, so she would be sure not to enjoy her meal.

So as the energies on Earth continue to change and shift, we must stay in touch with our feelings. It is our work to shift our attention and our awareness away from the confines of logic and reason, our thinking mind, and to focus on our feeling nature. Our intuition will guide us, and we will feel our way into the next dimension, the next leap of evolution.

Arwen has been at home with me for the last 12 years, except for the one year of preschool where she managed to meet her best friend and cry every single time I dropped her off. When I say 'at home with me', I did allow her out now and then! Dance, gym, co-ops, classes, friend's houses, sleepovers. Her education, though, was firmly in my hands.

The story was that someone had ‘mended’ the breakaway bookcase between rehearsals and the live TV show. John Ward tells me this someone he knows who was there at the time says balsa wood had been replaced by real wood, though this is not quite the story Charlie Drake himself told (here on YouTube). The implication (not shared by Charlie, of course) was that he was so disliked (which he certainly was) that the bookcase had been intentionally ‘firmed up’ to injure him. He fractured his skull, was unconscious for three days and it was two years before he returned to the screen.

Lardo is basically just the cured fat of a prosciutto ham. It spreads like butter once it hits room temperature. Butter that tastes like great ham or bacon. I am appalled at how much I ate of that pile. The head cheese was one of the best I’ve had in my life. The flavor and texture had none of the unappetizing notes that you usually associate with head cheese.
No offense to any of you who like first person shooters but… I think they are a bit overused. Since they are overused, I lost my love for them. Their stories are not even that good… I mean, come on! Seriously? I find it shocking sooo many people actually like first person shooters these days.

Now, I’m part rebel, part goodie-goodie, so I tried half a pot in line with their suggestion and half a good deal longer, on the basis that I like my cuppa to be good and strong. And you know what? They were right! 4 minutes made a perfectly good, strong cup of Assam and the 6-7 minutes brew just wasn’t the same.

Lucio worked with Homeland Security to beautify the fence. Near the course, the wall is several feet shorter than elsewhere and is painted green. The wall is so subtle that some putters, many of them “winter Texans” from Canada and the Midwest, don’t realize they’re on the south side of the border wall, he says. A gate would change that.
Perhaps more impressive are their cocktails. I had the pleasure of trying The Big Apple with Leopold Brothers' NY Apple Whiskey, Campari, Apple Cider, Lemon and Bitters. It might look almost too sweet and fruity on the menu, but it's definitely not - the Campari's herbal bitterness definitely tempered the other ingredients, and the cider is more about the bubbles than sugar, making this a delightful daytime sipper.

Reading Pal’s post about Geert Hofstede’s new book I was struck by the claim that Hofstede is more cited than any anthropologist, hands down. I wondered how true this was and thought I’d run a quick test. While not looking at citations, I ran a search on Google Insights of Hofstede with a couple of prominent anthropological names: Bruno Latour, Claude Levi-Strauss, Paul Farmer, and Margaret Mead. This compares the number of times these names have been used in web searches between 2004 and 2009.

I led with “I have a question to ask you, but don’t want you to think it has in any way to do with us, it’s just something I’m curious about.” Or so I think- like I said, I was drunk, so this is just a slightly inaccurate reenactment of how the actual conversation went. D’s answer was essentially “no”. I don’t remember if he said “no” before or after he said something like “Well, when it comes to you and me…” What a mess. I also don’t remember if I asked the initial question before or after we stared intensely into each other’s eyes while listening to Boyz II Men. No, I am not joking! It was very romantic. Anyways, I don’t remember the context in which I asked the question but it was obviously taken in the way I didn’t want it to be taken. I followed up with a hasty, “Well I have loved people, but have never been in love with someone,” and “I also feel there’s a difference between love and infatuation.” He ended the conversation on a good note, saying he appreciated that we could discuss such subjects in an analytical manner. Hmm. Whether or not he believed me when I said I didn’t want to know if he loved me, I don’t know.

I would have known should I have planned my dinner the other night. Who knew that bologna (yes I like it on white mushy wonder bread) had 3 points per slice and the worlds smallest bologna sandwich is 11 points? I would have if I looked up the dang points before putting 2 slices between 2 slices of bread with a slice o' cheese. NOM NOM!

Why is it, that a peasant in ice-cold Russia, or a farmer in Arctic Canada or a farmer in the deserts of Australia; can get a higher return on investment than a Black African, in warm tropical Africa where there is no winter and it rains much of the year round. You will wonder why it is that people who live in a perfect farming climate are starving to death year after year, while others, who live in snow-fields or in deserts can provide for themselves.
Unfortunately, the future of this country, as well as the fate of the Western world, depends on how many people can be fooled on election day, just a few weeks from now.

These pancakes are by far the fluffiest of the fluff that I’ve ever had. I adapted the recipe so that the oil is replaced by the applesauce, and there is no added unrefined sugar (except in the vanilla almond milk, but you could use unsweetened if you want). I used plain old all-purpose flour because I wanted the green to really pop. But you could experiment with whole wheat pastry or spelt flour.
This Wondermark cartoon (in a very different style than usual; see the note to the cartoon) nicely captures the problem of identifying the monstrous. The bull-headed minotaur of mythology might seem like a monster to the knight in the image, but he won't seem like a monster to himself. And the man-headed monster that chases them both probably thinks they are the monsters.
I've been up and functioning for a while now and I still feel good, so that is a good sign. As soon as I start to feel the stress build up again, I will go back to sleep because I think I have to catch up on it after so many days of rapd cycling. Right now I won't worry about when I sleep, but that I sleep. That seems to be the most important thing.
We ended up deciding to save the last two stories in Half-Minute Horrors for last night. So after a somewhat blustery night of trick-or-treating, we gathered round the kitchen table, nibbled on some sweet potato cupcakes, and finished up this positively wonderful book! I have to say--some of the stories in this book just blew me away! While I'm not a writer, I have to imagine that it can't be an easy feat to pull off a truly creepy little tale in so few words. And yet so many of these authors managed to do it so well. Love. This. Book.
Angela's Ashes is the cure for anyone who thinks their life sucks. If you are reading this, you've got electricity. I'm willing to bet your clothes are relatively clean and decent, and (especially if you're an American like me) you're probably not very hungry. (Yeah, I'm talking to you! Put down the Cheetos!) In fact, Angela would say that we "don't have a notion of not having." But even in their constant state of want, there were still times the McCourt family managed to help those less fortunate, because "there are always people worse off and we can surely spare a little from what we have." It was mind-boggling enough that there were people less fortunate, but even more amazing to see the generosity of those who had so little to begin with.

"Worn Path" is about a very old Black woman on her way to a clinic to get medicine for her grandson. It is told in a very simple style, almost as if it were a folk story rather than the carefully crafted work of art it is. As the woman makes her long journey she encounters obstacles (at times it almost felt like something out of The Wizard of Oz) from a barking dogs to a young Caucasian hunter. (As background information, we do need to know that setting is one in which racism is very much still a daily factor in life and is accepted as the norm.) The hunter tries to help her, offering her a nickel but he treats the woman-old enough to be his great-grandmother with no respect as if she were a simple minded child. The woman also clearly has a diminished mental capacity brought on by her old age. The story seems so simple on the surface but it admits of many readings but just for the mere facts of the story as well as the multiple symbolic themes we can find-

At present, we have an unfathomable diversity of and an unprecedented ease of intercultural communication available to us, which those who are reading this right now are using at this very second: the internet. Because of this situation, and because of tools like the internet, syncretism is going to be a greater and greater reality to be taken seriously in the future. Again, this is not a bad thing, and offers a great deal to be excited about in the development of modern polytheistic theology and practice.

King Kroma wafted deftly to his feet on the ground and without missing a beat stepped over to Pandora to deliver her great harm; with the drow laid dying, his attention turned to Brother Vang whom had strode up to meet the lich in battle that he might rescue his friend. Arrows sailed, holy water showering down as Meryk hastened to avoid retribution; Brother Vang managed to pull Pandora from death’s door before standing valiant before the lich–yet with a second deathly touch, the inheritor crusader’s life was seized and snuffed out.

Remember that the progress below has been achieved in the face of the most gargantuan media smear and slander campaign in history. This is the first time that we have mounted such a national challenge to the establishment and their response has been hysterical, if not outright panic. Such a torrent of lies, smears, slander, fabrications, distortions and half-truths has never been waged against a legitimate political party in British history. It is an historical first. However, no matter what happens at the polls, this Party is now playing on the world stage.
Music takes you back. There are some songs I avoid, since they depress me or make me feel the unwanted tug of lifestyle choices I gratefully abandoned nearly 40 years ago. They want to take me back to places I never want to see again. But most of the playlist of my youth recreates all the positive feelings and joy I felt the first time I heard it.

However, when opportunity presents itself, we parents have to rally. We totally have to be prepared to take full advantage, even when we’re eaking out a whopping 60 minutes to ourselves. Saturday night, Nick was scheduled to play his very last hockey game, of his High School hockey career, of the regular season before playoffs. The pre-game ritual usually consists of me whipping up a quick pasta dinner (you know; carb loading) before packing up the car for parts unknown. Before we can leave, he has to get his bag together. Have you ever seen or smelled a hockey bag? It’s big enough to conceal a dead body and it reeks of decomposition too. He stick handles to loosen up, packs a few bottles of water (good hydration is vital), grabs a banana and when he’s feeling it, packs a PB&J just like Sydney Crosby. We’re exhausted before we pull out of the driveway.
So, here are some highlights, in no particular order (mostly because it's taking me forever to arrange the stupid pictures on here)...
There's a kind of denial at work when it comes to collecting - whether it be movies, books, or records. As a fan, you build a collection with the expectation that these are things that you'll be able to enjoy in the days and years ahead, over and over, at your leisure. But at a certain point, you have to realize that your life simply won't be long enough to enjoy all these things that you've amassed. Like, not even if you were a vampire or something. I look at my movie collection, a collection that adds up to tens of thousands of hours of films and televisions shows, and I have to admit that, even if I live an exceptionally long life, that I already own more movies than I'll ever have the time to watch again. As much as I'd like to go back and watch all of them at least one more time, I know that I won't.

Of course, there are things about this movie that I could still nitpick about, but the bottom line is that it's real and it's happening, and next summer can't come fast enough. Of course, whether we'll be able to see it in 3D is another story...
I jumped out of bed. I started to scream. Evan called 911. The night nurse continued to do CPR. Sawyer’s coloring was all wrong – but he was not blue. I wanted to hold him.

Neon colors are not trying to wage war against any color but trying work complimentary with all. The best way to bring peace to an outfit is to match the neon with colors that are classic or neutral such as blacks, navy, white, or browns.

The wind is transcendental to a forest. It moves through the forest. It can be perceived within the forest. It causes things to happen within the forest, but it is not a product of the forest. In a bamboo forest, many of the reeds get brown and dry. When the winds come, friction between these reeds causes a huge fire. The green reeds survive because the fire burns very quickly. The brown reeds turn to ash and fertilize the ground.

AXA Equitable offers an age limited single life policy to age 90 called Athena UL which was introduced in March 2009. David O’Leary, AXA Equitable Executive Vice President of Financial Protection, said Athena UL provides flexibility for consumers as their financial protection needs change when moving through different life stages. The policy has progressive underwriting and a series of riders for special concerns. For example, “we offer a long term care rider that is an acceleration of the death benefit,” O’Leary said. A no extra charge charitable legacy rider pays at death one percent of the face amount to the insured’s charity of choice in addition to the death benefit. For insureds that live beyond the age limit, he said, “If the policy is still in force, it will pay the full death benefit if the owner is still paying premiums and/or the policy has sufficient cash value.”

I could tell it went well as the local shirtless and toothless drunkards high fived me with their 40s. I have to say, it was my favorite concert I have played here so far. I LOVE the streets of Paris and I ESPECIALLY love being amplified really loud in them. I wish Paris was like this every night.....ALIVE and LOUD. I thought the noise ordinances in New York had gotten ridiculously bad, but they are NOTHING compared to Paris. My major complaint is this....artists move to a cheap area and start a scene, the Bobos follow suit and move to the now "cool" area and then proceed to complain about the level of noise. I saw it happen in New York and it's the same, even worse here. I have been told I am singing too loud by soooo many clubs here because of the "neighbors". Maybe it is the same in every city. But enough! This is a CITY, not a morgue and no cultural scene will thrive to its fullest if it is constantly being shut down for fear of "upsetting the neighbors". If it's so horrible, then move to one of the many quiet suburbs and stop trying to squelch the life that MAKES a city.

Something you might know: OK. It's the beaning. Thon looked like he was going to be something special for five years until he was drilled in the eye by a fastball from the Mets' Mike Torrez on April 8, 1984. The pitch broke the orbital bone around his left eye and messed up his depth perception. For awhile, it looked like he may never play again. But he returned in '85 and actually lasted until 1993 with some decent seasons. But he wasn't like he was in 1983 -- a potential future Hall of Famer.

Gay does have another meaning, not to make a big thing of it. And spring is the time for gay clothes, pieces that seek the sun, ever warmer and more insistent on the back.
However, I'm don't want to get into the manipulation and sickening use of the attack for political purposes; instead I think it's important to remember that there were nearly 3,000 people that were killed, and that those people were innocently murdered for the sake of a radical religio-political ideology whose aim it was to strike fear into our hearts, and disrupt our way of living. The people who were killed were fathers and mother, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, friends. Many thousands of people that were nowhere near the World Trade Center, The Pentagon, or the field outside of Shanksville, PA, were affected by losing someone they loved. The ability to deal with and move on from this tragedy has been different for everyone, and some people grieve best by getting revenge. Some people grieve by withdrawing, and closing themselves off to the outside world until they've had time to figure things out for themselves. Some people go on with their lives as if nothing has changed, constantly trying to not remember the horrific events they've witnessed, or the loved ones they've lost. Others simply weep at the unimaginable destruction that was wrought, both to the planes and the buildings that were crashed into, but also in the hearts of people who cannot comprehend what would compel someone to do something so awful to others. The truth is that there is no comprehension of how people can come up with, plan and execute such a ghastly endeavor; but I guess our goal should not be to comprehend, but to feel sympathy not only for ourselves, but also for those that harbor so much hatred and anger within themselves.
Perhaps most significantly, Obama is simply not interested in foreign and defense policy. To state such a proposition about a U.S. president seems counterintuitive or even shocking, but Obama is different from all of his predecessors, Republican or Democrat, since Franklin Roosevelt. His first thought on awakening each morning is not about threats to America, its global interests, and its friends and allies, but about his efforts to radically restructure our economy and society. That is where his intellect and his heart are focused, and his lack of attention to the rest of the world is palpable. When Obama has no other choice but to concentrate on international affairs--such as during the Afghanistan surge or the killing of Osama bin Laden--he will do so, but only for as long as is necessary to address the immediate problem before him.
I like to cook, and I’m pretty good at it, but when you take food to an “event,” there’s some expectation of presentation. Let’s just say I was absent the day they taught presentation in Home Ec or was standing behind the door when the Martha Stewart genes were passed out. I think my friend Mary got my share. She can make a simple snack of cheese, crackers, and fruit look like a feast, and her home-baked goods always look like they came fresh from the most elegant bakery in town. She says the secret is paper doilies on the platter, but I can never find paper doilies in the store, and the rare occasions when I have them, I never have the right size.
There are many others. Maybe one day those who have seen Victor Matfield play will say the same. At the moment it looks like Lionel Messi will achieve more than any other footballer before him. If only Argentina can manage a World Cup win or two during the next three tournaments he might also achieve legendary status. Just when nobody thought that anybody could surpass Pete Sampras’ achievements on the world’s tennis stage along came Roger Federer and Rafeal Nadal. Tiger Woods can also be slotted in here. Sashin Tendulkar, Shane Warne, Muttiah Muralitharan, John Eals, Zidane, the list goes on and on.

And, while we're about it, it would be nice to hear from Mr Tim Montgomerie and Mr Tom Harris MP, whom we e-mailed yesterday. We await their observations with very great interest. But why is it that I suspect that we will hear nothing more from these clever, sophisticated people? No doubt they are far too grand and far too clever to reply to mail from such lowly mortals as us.

Okay, now I want you to think about a smell that you detect. One that has a nasty kind of aroma, the aroma of something rotting. You may look around trying to discern where the smell is coming from. Could it be the potatoes? Nope, the potatoes don’t have the aroma of rotting. (p.s. potatoes stink big time when they become rotten!) What about the onions? Nope, they all seem to be ok. Bananas? Nope. Check the apples in the bowl. Down near the bottom of the bowl is the source of the rotted smell. As you take the apples out, you realize that the apple on top has an area that is soft and mushy. The next apple has a larger portion of it that has rotted and in the bottom is the culprit,,a nasty rotten apple that feels totally mushy when you pick it up. Several other apples in the bowl have also developed areas of rot. Yuck, get them into the trash and get the trash out the door right away. Do not simply discard in to the trash receptacle as the rotting will continue and you whole house will stink to high heaven!

Mercedes GP are rumoured to be running a novel front wing. This has been reported in the three major F1 magazines (AMuS, Auto sprint and Autosport). It seems the front wing uses the nose hole to blow a slot under the wing. Although this is a completely passive system (i.e. no moving parts or driver intervention), the fact that it alters aero performance at speed, has seen it dubbed as an F-duct Front Wing.

I used my new crackle glossy accent stuff to coat the tiny stamps that I used at the top of each banner piece. I really like how it turned out even though it is hard to see in the photos. I also used the tag die-cut and coordinating stamp set "Just the Ticket" from PTI for some of the accents. I had used it in the card I made a post or two down and really wanted to incorporate it into the banner as well. I purchased all of the paper at Hobby Lobby and while it isn't St. Patricksy at all, I really like the feel. I also sewed up a little bench runner to tie everything together which you can see in the photo at the end of the post.

Partially the problem with the kebabs was that since I only had those two stupid skewers, I tried to pack on a lot of beef onto them. They were a little beef heavy. I ended up making burgers with the leftover beef anyway, so I should have just stuck to putting just a small amount on the skewers like I knew I should have. If you can’t find Aleppo pepper, you can substitute with other ground red peppers. A 3:1 paprika to cayenne ratio would be good, as would mixing in some ground ancho peppers, or other red chili peppers. Just don’t go crazy with the cayenne or you might die. When grating the onion for this beef, be smart and choose to use your handy food processor with grating attachment. I grated my onion by hand because my food processor was dirty and I was too lazy to wash it. So, when the first wave of blinding onion fumes hit my eyes, I proceeded to grate the rest of the onion with my eyes closed. Smart. I only nearly lost my finger tips like 6 times. No biggie.

One such thing is the unfortunate fact that this book tells no lies – it’s incredibly honest, but in a subtle way. If you tell it a secret, it won’t clumsily splutter it out, it will carefully emblazon it into the clouds for everyone to see. It’s this subtlety that makes the book so harrowing. Anyhow, you might be wondering where one can find some of this subtlety stuff that I’m always talking about. Since my aforementioned spluttering has robbed me of both bodily fluids and my ability to withhold crucial information from you, I will just glumly point you in the direction of the narrative. Like I was saying, the narrative plays a pivotal role in encouraging tears to come out of readers. Some people might already began to sob at the quality of it; it’s hilarious through its witty dialogue and witty thoughts and just general wittiness, in addition to being fabulously well written but what I foresee provoking the most tear inducing feels within the readers is the candid emotional content included in the narrative – Hazel, narrator, is such a genuine character, therefore making her actions and emotions realistic and heart breaking and surprisingly relatable.

Stereotyping characters is something many writers do without even thinking about it. Not all people of Asian descent are small of stature with eyes that tilt up at the corners. Some of them are quite tall and have eyes that tilt downward. People of African descent aren’t just “black” or of basketball player size. The colors run the entire spectrum from palest coffee to deepest ebony and some of them are actually a bit on the short side. And not all Germans are Nazi madmen or jolly rotund women toting pots of coffee and serving strudel.

The exercise, like its predecessors, is based on a “crisis response” scenario and a United Nations mandate. Like Libya last year, for instance.

The above quote by Giovanni is directed towards a pair of children, Kaoru and Tadashi, who have been asked to leave the train at their specific stop. Tadashi attempts to stay on longer; however, following Giovanni’s invitation, Kaoru responds that they have to get off at this stop in order to get to heaven. This exchange devolves into a small argument about the validity of Kaoru’s god versus Giovanni’s own. After all, Giovanni’s god wouldn’t want Kaoru and Tadashi to leave, therefore Kaoru’s god must be wrong. In addition to this, Giovanni also makes the claim that what one could experience in life is better than any afterlife, provided that you willfully create such a place. This idea of fighting against your fate and God is exactly what the Takakura brothers are introduced as trying to do in their attempts to save their ailing sister Himari who only has days to live.
During his cross-examination of Scott, Paul McBride QC (acting for Gail Sheridan) made much of Scott’s claim that she had given evidence in 2006 with these notes “in her handbag”, asking her why, if she had that evidence all along, she had not shared it with the court.

We can only be reconciled to God through trusting in Christ. That is part of the gospel message. In order to do that, it helps to understand who Jesus is and what he has done. One event in the life of Christ that is largely ignored by the evangelical church is the ascension of Christ. I suppose part of the reason for that is that Luke is the only one who gives a solid account of it. It is included in Mark’s gospel, but in the part of the last chapter that most scholars believe was not written by Mark in the original document.

When I entered college I didn’t go with the delusional belief that work would be waiting for me when I got out. I didn’t want to study something practical because that’s not what college is for to me. To me I went to college to be exposed to intellectual pursuits. To learn for the sake of learning. No sane person majors in media studies or communication thinking that they will be handed a high paying job for their trouble. At least no thoughtful or reflective person thinks that.

It’s helpful to read Anthony Ogden’s article “The View From the Veranda: Understanding Today’s Colonial Student,” which lays down a challenge to the education abroad industry in the USA in fairly controversial terms. Of course, it’s not hard to find evidence of a consumer mentality in student exchange, and study abroad programs often find the need to balance the marketable appeal of certain features of the program with the programs’ goals to educate students about the world and foster intercultural understanding. Ogden’s fear is that students are too frequently buying an experience, for its interesting culture, for the language learning, for the broadened perspective even, and are not often enough participating in an intercultural exchange where the hosting community gains as much from having the student as the student gains from being there. And in fact, the students may not even gain that much from the experience if they are either overwhelmed by the cultural differences they encounter, or given too little exposure for fear of safety concerns, dietary restrictions, or anything else that keeps them in their own enclave of study abroad students.
thank you soooo much.
Doing self treatments, strengthens our connection to Reiki, which helps reprogram our thoughts. Any negative, hurtful or non-loving thoughts, begin to change and heal. This takes place at a subconscious level, whereby we become conscious of the root; meaning once and for all, we become free from their influence, it no longer affects what we attract or the vibration we send out. They are out of our energy field. We now elevate to a higher vibration never having to worry about that pattern(s) affecting us again.
Through this process I am hoping that God will show me which turns to take and which ones to avoid. Right now that is all I can hope for.

It’s scary to think – and I’m sure most of you with pit bull type dogs would agree – that any of our dogs could be ripped away from us with little to nothing we could do about it if we ended up somewhere with BSL. Otis is of course one example, but he falls more under the “wrongly labeled as a pit bull type dog” category. While he’s got a blocky head, that’s about it – his lean figure and extra slobbery jowls suggest many other breeds before pit bull. But he could fall victim to discrimination in a heartbeat if the wrong person saw him in a community with a breed ban. Such a shame.

As a result, through the sacrament of reconciliation, Catholics enjoy absolute forgiveness for all their sins, right here and right now, virtually without exception, while everyone else will have to wait until Judgment Day to find out for sure if God has truly forgiven them. Catholics also appreciate the sacrament of reconciliation as a primary source of God’s superabundant grace … grace that is typically lost through sin.

After locating the site, I revisited the idea of the bang being a rectilinear room in which programs were based on the interior furnishings of the room. This made me question the shape of the room and how a sloped wall would affect the interior program. Then, I questioned how rotating this module would affect the types of programs that the bang offered and how it could begin to shape experiences as well. This ultimately lead to a discovery in which the bangs could be developed as modules that stack with one another and the overlapping walls and floors could become a hybrid surface in which the program above and below or side by side share that surface’s form and use it for different functions.

They don’t read files properly, they ask for information which is unnecessary – like, they will demand interview transcripts for utterly trivial matters where no-one has been interviewed in the first place. They lose files in this extraordinary black hole that they seem to have in their offices, and have to have them re-sent, by fax like it’s the 1980s, often more than once. Plus they seem to see themselves more as an arm of the defence than of the prosecution. I’ve known cast-iron cases where they refuse charge. If you argue with them, they’re quite ready to go over your head to your boss and complain about you.

"Shutter Island" has the extra problem of being a product of its time, where the construction of the plot is more important than the sum of its themes. It becomes a series of parlor tricks that leads to a conclusion that is not as mind-blowing as the director or writer hoped. It feels like someone telling you they will pull a table cloth off without pulling off the dishes. They tug at the cloth just a little and then say they are going to do it for real this time. They then repeat this several more times, before flipping the entire table with the dishes crashing to the floor. Those dishes are the Big Twist.
Turn out onto a floured piece of parchment or wax paper, divide into two equal sized pieces of dough and set one aside. Take the first piece of dough and roll out into (roughly) a 9×9 inch square, 1/2-inch thick. You want to keep the dough from sticking to the mat/paper if possible, so sprinkle with more flour if needed. Slather the slab of dough with the jam and fold the left side of the dough in toward the center. To discourage the dough from breaking or falling apart I fold it in by folding the wax paper in and then peeling the wax paper back afterwards. Fold the other side in using the same technique (if I’m not making sense, see the photo). Slide onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the other piece of dough. The two scones will fit on one baking sheet but give them a few inches between each other so they don’t bake into each other. Bake for about 25 minutes or until golden where the scones touch the pan.
Always useful. Why not keep anything like this, including advances and royalties from eventual publications in a separate bank account? Put a tax allowance from royalties and advances into a separate savings account so that when the taxman calls for his share you have it ready. You don’t pay tax on competition wins. Then invest your earnings so that they grow more cash for you. Part of that investment should be in paying for further competition entries.
“I think we need to be prepared for all options. It is most likely that Hezbollah will join in and will strike Israel. Then Syria could be part of it, Gaza could be part of it. We need to be prepared for a multi-front conflict if we go to Iran,” he said.
So it got me thinking about four-leaf clovers and good luck and all of that. Like most people, I am convinced that success in life and business is impacted by luck. Being born to a wealthy and influential family, having loving and supportive parents, being exceptionally talented in science or with languages, getting seated next to a potential client at a dinner party—that’s all random good luck that no one can control.
That would represent a remarkable turnaround from a fortnight ago when, after a crushing loss at Arsenal, City appeared out of contention eight points behind.

Life was a blur. I had become a wife and mother and lost my mother all in less than a year and four months later Dad was too broken hearted to stay. He followed her home to God that February. The next couple of years were consumed with the business of being a new mom with no mother to consult with. I was away from my family but didn’t have to face their grieving every day so in its way it was a blessing.

Francesca is also sleeping with Cesare Borgia, the pope's oldest son. It is rumoured that Pope Alexander VI will make Cesare a Cardinal, which would put him in line to putting down a foundation for a dynasty of Borjia's to rule all of Christendom. The fear of this possiblity increases the opposition to Pope Alexander's rule. The main threat is from Morozzi, the mad priest. Morozzi is a threat to the Pope, and Francesca is hell bent on killing him with her own hands.
Conservatives point out that the party made millions of voter-identification and get-out-the-vote calls during the campaign, and suggest that misdirecting calls may be explained by bad data, caller error or incorrect recollections by the people who received the calls.

With a beginning Specific Gravity of 1046 it starts out a little ‘larger’ than the first (1040) and has certainly displayed a more noticeable aroma off the fermenter. Still haven’t seen a bubble come off the air lock so I guess those who advise against using this as a means of knowing when to bottle are on to something. By day four the S.G. is down to 1014 and day five to 1010 which, if it remains there, will give us an alcohol content of around 5.5%. Nice.
Forget the fact that we scuttled the Copenhagen climate talks and have been so friendly to the oil, gas, nuclear, and coal interests that we have likely ensured that our descendants and our planet will have a hot, polluted ,miserable future. Forget the fact that we have done absolutely nothing to prepare this country and its citizens for the massive changes the planet is about to undergo.

- Finally, Bruce Cheadle reports on the growing doubt about Senate elections from many of the parties and figures who previously pushed the model. But the point most worth highlighting (particularly given the prospect of a Con Senate majority holding at least theoretical power to utterly stymie the efforts of an NDP government in 2015) is the recognition that the Senate can't legitimately interfere with the decisions of elected representatives now.

I've tried many carrot cake recipes and there are many ways to make them moist. If you want to go for the healthy version, try using pumpkin puree for a part of the oil. It won't give off a weird flavor since the spices used in a carrot cake is the same as a pumpkin pie. Today's version is a hybrid between a pumpkin pie and a gingerbread cookie, it may sound awkward but it tastes amazing!
Over the course of this weekend we have been thinking about the Spirit and the role it has played in the life of the church and people throughout history, now we’re going to think about what it means for us today. The theme of our weekend is ‘walking with the spirit’, but what does this really mean? On the day of Pentecost, God poured out his Spirit upon those gathered and that Spirit lives in us today. We as Christians have the Holy Spirit living within us, but it isn’t always easy to follow the promptings it gives us. To walk with the spirit takes effort and is difficult, but as disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ it is what we are called to do. Our all too human weaknesses do not exempt us as believers from moral responsibility. As those who have received the Spirit, we have a resource for responsible daily living which we did not have before. We are to walk by the Spirit allowing ourselves to be led by the Spirit. In what I will say in this talk I am making the assumption that all of us gathered here believe that we should be walking with the Spirit in our daily lives. If anyone disagrees with that or has any questions, please do ask me or someone afterwards about it and we will be happy to talk to you, but I felt that rather than spend time looking at whether we should be walking with the Spirit, I would skip ahead to looking at how we might go about doing this in our daily lives. So here we go, what does ‘walking with the Spirit’ mean in practical everyday terms? Well it seems to me the best place to start is with scripture. Paul speaks a great deal about walking with the Spirit in his letters to the early churches. In Romans 8, verse 5 Paul tells us that ‘those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit’. Here in Romans he offers little practical advice about how to go about doing this, but elsewhere he speaks more specifically about what this means. Paul’s letter to the Philippians gives us a little more advice as in chapter 2, verses 3-4 we are told ‘Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility regard others as better than yourselves. Let each of you look not to your own interests, but to the interests of other’. This passage can be clearly linked to the words and attitudes of Jesus throughout the Gospels. Jesus urges his followers to love their neighbour as themselves and the parable of the Good Samaritan reminds them that everyone is their neighbour. Jesus’ attitude to people – especially excluded people – throughout his ministry shows that he truly believed in this idea. The Philippians would have known this as we do, and would have made this connection knowing that Paul was continuing to spread the same message as Jesus himself had done before him. Possibly the clearest and certainly the most descriptive of Paul’s thoughts on walking with the Spirit or ‘living by the Spirit’ as he often says comes in Galatians chapter 5. Galatians 5, verse 16 urges us to ‘live by the Spirit…and do not gratify the desires of the flesh’, and later in the chapter Paul explains what he considers to be ‘works of the flesh’ and what he considers to be ‘fruits of the Spirit’. Verse 19: ‘Now the works of the flesh are obvious: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, anger, quarrels, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these’. This is a fairly exhaustive list. I considered taking some time to explore what these works may mean for us today but then decided that given the theme of the weekend is walking with the spirit rather than not walking with the spirit, I would somewhat skip over this list and move on to look at the list that follows. Verse 22: ‘The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, generosity, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control’. I think you will probably agree that this is a much more chirpy list and will therefore understand why it is this list that I have chosen to focus on for much of the rest of this talk.
Britain’s problem is debt. And we are in debt because as a nation and as individuals we have lived beyond our means. Our personal debt is £1,500 billion and our public debt will reach that figure by 2014 (yes its getting bigger in spite of the Coalition’s plan to ‘cut the deficit’. All we are doing is borrowing less each year than we did in the previous one)

The thing is, the tension doesn't have to be life or death, although that's of course one of the strongest ways to do it. It could be simply that two siblings don't get along and it creates tension because you the reader, care about the fact that they are not getting along.
Due to the skyrocketing cost of living in Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina I relocated to western Kentucky where I now live. I continued to entertain the idea of starting an Anglican Mission church but in my new community. When the Anglican Mission and the Prayer Book Society USA jointly released Services of The Book of Common Prayer of 1662 in Contemporary English, I purchased a copy of the trial services with that end in mind. I was disappointed to discover that the services were not what they had been represented to be—contemporary English versions of the services of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer, and that Bishops Murphy and Rodgers had endorsed the use of the services. This was the beginning of what would become a growing disenchantment with the Anglican Mission. My dealings with Pawley Island and Peter Toon would contribute to this disenchantment. The subsequent publication of An Anglican Prayer Book in 2008 and Murphy and Rodgers’ endorsement of its use added to my disillusionment with the Anglican Mission. The book clearly did not conform to the requirements for alternative rites and forms for use in the Anglican Mission as laid out in the organization’s Solemn Declaration of Principles. Their endorsement raised questions in my mind regarding the genuineness of the Anglican Mission’s commitment to the historic Church of England formularies as its standards of faith and worship. Rodgers’ public admission of a softening of attitude toward Anglo-Catholics following a meeting with leading Anglo-Catholics at Nashotah House, the growing influence of the Anglican Mission’s Anglo-Catholic wing in that organization, and the Anglican Mission’s acceptance of the Common Cause Theological Statement further added to my disillusionment.

It's easy for me to say that I like Pinterest... nay, love Pinterest. It's like Twitter, but with only pretty things and no spam trying to convince me that I've won a new TV. (Really, who do they think they're fooling?) Some say that they "waste" hours at a time on Pinterest, but I would rather use the word "invest." I've pinned so many DIY projects, recipes, wedding ideas (for my real, upcoming wedding, no less), and just plain lovely things that I refer back to time and time again. I love the fact that we live in the age of the internet, and I can find wonderful things to do, make, and see from all over the globe at the click of a mouse!

There was an overwhelming response from the adoption community to WACAP's publicity of their "Journey of Hope" children, and the majority of the children were soon matched, but not all. More than a year passed and there were still children waiting from the program. Some of the children had been moved to the shared list and other Luoyang children were beginning to show up on individual lists. Some children had already been home for a year. The children left behind were communicating with those who had already found families, questioning when they too might have a family. The pleas of one particular child, "Jonathan", pulled on the heartstrings of "Sue" (not her real name) as he continued to wait. Jonathan was telling his friends who were already in America that if he did not have a family soon, the orphanage would kick him out. "Someone help me get adopted," he pleaded to his friends. Word spread and Sue wondered what would happen to him, so she called WACAP and inquired if she could actually bring him home.

There are two sections of this song that provide the most enticement. The first being the vocal samples that start and run through the breakdown of the song. It’s an extremely unexpected turn of events, as pitched, semi-vocated, and sampled Iamamiwhoami vowel pronunciations are thrown into the song to start off the song’s finale. Larger, whole note “ahh” supporting vocals are also thrown into this section of the track, which offers a legato feel while staccato elements are brought into play.
(There is another, more minor, reason to watch said horror films. Simply because they are useful. A cinephile may not have to watch the films of Michael Bay to understand the films of Dreyer, but to the horror fan I do believe that it is helpful for the horror fan to understand what say Sean Cunningham does wrong in order to fully appriciate what Bryan Bertano does right. Or as King puts it “For the horror fan, films such as Exorcist II form the setting for the occasional bright gemstone that is discovered in the darkness of a sleazy second run movie house….You don’t appreciate cream unless you’ve drunk a lot of milk and maybe you don’t appreciate milk until you’ve drunk some that’s gone sour.)
Week 10 Agenda
And, and, and, here it comes: the centerpiece of the table is a girl, a maid, dressed up as a turkey but with a red apple in her mouth. She´s on her elbows and knees and her neither parts are bare, framed by fake turkey feathers – U get the pic. She curves her back and shows her fanny to everyone. Behind her is Gustav Adolf Ekdahl, also on his knees on the table, pants down, erection up and laughing together with his dinner guests who all seem to think this is so much fun. The he takes her. Everyone at the party´s happy. The poor people press their noses against the window glass and watch.

I cannot express how amazed I am at these people… I truly am at a loss for words when I encounter one of these. They beat the Argumentators at their own game, and they do it in style. The Argumentator has the courtesy to pretend to listen to what you’re saying, and respond with some appropriately inane remark. The Moron, on the other hand, goes for broke.

It is a well known fact that the larger part of what we know, we learned from watching others. One can only do this if you manage to be still - only in stillness can you concentrate and absorb. This is an impossible task today - 'new' diseases keep popping up that make it impossible for some kids to learn and absorb in stillness. They simply can't be still anymore - they run and fiddle like wind-up toys. All thanks to ADD, ADHD and every other DD you can think of. The concept of discipline has flown off to a far-off place. Today the majority of kids learn everything they know and much more than what is good for them from the magic square old box. The same one that I was warned against as a child - yes .... "it will fry your nuts, rot your brain and you'll get square eyes if you sit to close to it."

I created my pretty background by stamping my lace border with Versamark ink and embossing with lilac embossing powder. I added a bit of Copic marker B21 for some extra shading. I stamped my Spring Rose Medallions with Memento Summer Sky and lightly added a bit of color to the roses and leaves with Copic Markers. I stamped my sentiment, cut it out with the Nested Oval Medallion Dies, then shaded with Lulu Lavender ink by Memento. I cut out one of the small Spellbinders™ Persian Motifs, edged it with blue ink, and nested my sentiment piece inside, then layered it to my Spring Rose Medallions piece. I added pearls and a beautiful stacked Silk Ribbon bow. My ribbon is from the Stamp Simply Ribbon Store and if you haven't made a silk bow, you are missing out! It is so soft and ties the best bow ever!!!
82. Invisible Man: Ralph Ellison
We see the political discourse of Scotland being a welcoming of asylum seekers and holding close of refugees – a discourse which is echoed by the neighbourly welcoming those in need through community action groups. Even if there are tensions at times and even violence, the over-arching is a welcome, a social commentary from the roots of Scotland which disparages the actions of the UKBA and rails against the inhumanity of decisions made in the tribunals. The political discourse in the UK, meanwhile is that of the fortress, of quotas and caps and fast rejection, the contest seems to be who can hang toughest, who can play the card closest to the wire, and who can match the vitriol of the least reasonable newspapers. The civic chatter is muted at best, and the words from the pens and keyboards of the concerned populace appears to be concerned with preserving property and lifestyles rather than offering friendship and humanity.
Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner had earlier ruled out any possibility of military action, saying that her country would pursue talks at the UN, and negotiate sovereignty with the UK.

I'm fighting a war. A war against spiders. Every night before bed, I check my sheets for them, shoe in hand, ready to brutally end their lives with way more force than necessary. Sometimes I find one and even if I kill it, I still can't go to sleep because it confirmed my fear that sometimes there are spiders waiting in my bed for me.

I put more thought into my sides. I ordered the sweet potato casserole. It is amazing. I’d say the primary ingredients are mashed sweet potatoes, butter, brown sugar, and chopped pecans. If potatoes count as vegetables, than sweet potatoes are my favorite. Honestly, though, the casserole is so decadent that I’m tempted to classify sweet potatoes as a dessert instead. I’m a cole slaw fiend, so I ordered that as my second side. It was disappointing: too much mayonnaise and too much vineger. The cabbage had marinated for so long that it had lost its firmness. I took only a few bites. (For the record, the best slaw in town is the veggie slaw at Gabby’s in Wyoming.)
Do I need to remind you all that we live in the Midwest? I know the weather has been absolutely BEAUTIFUL, but, again - we live in the Midwest.

When I saw Dr. D a while back she was about to send off some sample tumour tissue for testing to see if I have the B-RAF genetic mutation. As you will doubtless recall , Vemurafenib (formerly PLX-4032) only works for people with this mutation so I am trying hard to feel lucky. It was almost two years ago that we first talked about doing this but for various reasons it was not practical to follow up until now. Vemurafenib is still available in Canada only for clinical trials so I am now enrolled in one. The lab called to say that I should have the results of the test Real Soon Now. Even if I am eligible to proceed it is unlikely that I will start a course of the drug at present. However it would be good to know that there was a BFG that could be used if and when I need some serious ammunition against the cancer.
One of the biggest piles of BS that floats around is the “Christian” business directory. The new one for the Louisville area is due out soon.

This experience had the dual impact of illustrating how vulnerable Egypt could be to successive low flows in the absence of the High Dam, but also the importance of a more integrated basin-wide management regime for Egypt’s water security. Successive low-flow years would require more than one massive structure to help achieve greater water security in the future; upstream augmentation of flows would also be important.

I am a man who tries to parent consciously. At each parenting milestone, from birth to cribs to diapers to education, I have paused to learn, listen, reflect, and form my own opinions about the path we should choose. I fully recognize that many - most - of the decisions we have made are far outside of the mainstream, and as such we run the risk of being labeled as "radicals". I don't much care for the term, frankly, which is why you'll never see me using the term "radical unschooling." To me, my choices are not radical at all; they are simply the obvious results of a life lived with conscious questioning and application of what I have learned from experience.

No matter the genre, beards and mustaches have come to define lots of musicians. Whether it’s a beard or some mutton chops, male musicians who can grow facial hair (because lets face it, not all men can grow good facial hair) add a layer of gravitas to their persona. If Lady Gaga could, she would probably have the craziest facial hair in all of music, just to have that air of awesomeness that facial hair can bring to a person. More musicians should take a hint from these guys and let their hair grow!

MJ is having a busy weekend and taking us along for the ride (meaning we're providing taxi service). Friday afternoon, she and Chloe went with Chris, Chelsea, and Chelsea's friend Alexis to see "28 Weeks Later." After the show (which seemed to be well received), Frank and I picked up Chloe at Chris and Denise's house. MJ stayed behind so she could get up really early Saturday morning to start setting up for the Sons of Italy dinner. She worked there all day yesterday, about 14 hours' worth. Frank, Chloe, and I showed up just to eat and watch the action for a while. MJ looked quite grown-up behind the serving counter! Erin took some pictures; watch for them on Emma's blog (link at right).
Another nine hour shift of being constantly on my feet and 3 hours worth of travelling to get there and back and yet I am still pretty awake and happy! This is probably because while i was there my new manager said they would still honour my previously booked holiday on the 4th March and SO..as soon as i got home (half hour ago) i entered myself into the milton keynes half marathon eeeek!! Hoping this will help me to feel what the actual marathan is going to be like. Looking forward to it.

However this movie tells the story of a rather fat man who wants to be a police officer but at the start of the movie he is working as a security guard at a shopping mall. An unarmed security guard. He rolls around on a Segway and performs his duty but wishes to be more important and less rídiculed. Meets a nice girl working at the mall and at first manages to mess it all up.

On a recent visit to South Africa, I was told very confidently by a man who knows the inner workings of the government that Zuma's true tally is actually 35 children, including a set of twins with a woman from Ukraine.
There were spectators along the entire route. There was always people cheering you on, which really helped push me along. Especially the last 10K. The hills never stopped. We would get a nice downhill to recover, just to go up another massive hill.
Enter Grifter Summer IPA. This is the second in the brewery's new line-up of seasonal offerings, following a beer I completely missed, Sling Shot. In their press release, Mac's writes describes the series as "a growing portfolio of distinct, bold, and original offerings." I have grown to distrust press releases that use vague superlatives like this--usually it means the beer is likely to be bland, indistinct, and unoriginal. But with good packaging!
Think how much better we would all get along!
He went on saying that “South Sudan government, on the top of which are (South Sudan President) Salva Kiir (Mayardit) and (chief negotiator) Pagan (Amum), does not care about its citizens because at the time when they send their sons and families to live and receive education abroad, they send the South Sudanese citizens to war with Sudan to target its economic capabilities,” he added.

These are just a few examples. In each, the goal is the same: to provide a gentle shock to the editor's staid linguistic habits.
Scott: On the one hand, “the customer is always right”, so it’s definitely in Bioware’s interest to appease fans. On the other hand it sets a dangerous precedent for the industry. I don’t even just mean a dangerous precedent for the democratization of content, but also for how publishers will react. Bioware is a pretty big deal for EA, but what happens if the next time is a smaller studio? Will the publisher back them up and support the post-release plot change, or will they take the fan outcry as a failing and close the studio? Or it could lead to publishers wanting to have more control over narrative-driven games, with plots only approved for production if there is a successful game with the same plot to show demand. This is something that already happens with game genres, so if fans make game narrative a big enough issue I can see the same thing happening there as well.

When we commenced the thinking and planning of our huge and potentially revolutionary idea called “United Classrooms,” we decided that it would only arrive in its most brilliant form if molded by a wide and dynamic community of people, not just us. Over the last 5 weeks, we have watched that community grow and take shape — and frankly, it moves us.

It is critical that you have a solid professional and searchable web presence. If your social media efforts are successful, then it is likely that your website will be the link between social media and client activity. Your website must reflect your face to the market—your size and scope—and it should present a good case for why someone would want to do business with you.

The enjoyable self-confident swingy ‘Do My Own Thing’ is about being comfortable with yourself even if it isn’t “the in thing”. ‘Ain’t On the Menu’ is a cute love letter to a waitress the bashful protagonist has had a crush on for the past year. ‘Right Where You Belong’ is a mellow love ballad set just after the couple have spent their first night together.

Indeed, we find in Black God, White Devil a film that is greater than the sum of its parts. For all of its confusion concerning the caracters, it is a remarkable film. Its impossible scenarios of evil and morality create a kind of dream world where the characters seem to float by. Its black and white photograph crackles with heat and dry wind. The world is as stark as film negative.
Face it. Some sentences are more boring than others, pretty plain and ordinary. And if you use adverbs, they can be a lazy or unimaginative way of telling the reader what's going on. Instead, try using more active verbs and shoot for lively phrasings. Consider these examples:

Since I have such difficulty finding hats, since my hair is so big. And I see no advice in fashion magazines or even the blogs, despite the minor hawking of hats as coming back and pimping out of hats that YOU can wear, unless, you know, your hair swallows it, I was thrilled to find the rules of thumb for hats in the pages of this tome.

Their story becomes a heart-wrenching young love affair, full of poignancy and heartbreak. There is a great deal of dying and cancer-related humour provided by both characters. Written by any other voice, this humour could be classified as distasteful, but coming from Hazel and Augustus the witty comments about cancer and death are funny in an inoffensive yet profound way.
While I was out in the driveway section of the property this weekend, I decided to tackle a weeding / clearing out job I'd been putting off for ages. My darling husband has been working on extending the garage at the end of the driveway for a while now. It's slow-going, as he's doing everything himself, but only doing what we can afford each step of the way. He's now up to the 'adding-fill' part of the job, so the end is getting a little closer.

I think I'll put in a reminder to spend some time each day training Siri how to respond. I think I'll do it manually. Use the keypad like I did on my old phone. It's like that old saying 'If you want it done right, do it yourself.' Maybe I should think of her as a new employee - once she learns the ropes she should be invaluable. The potential is there - I only hope she makes it through the trial period. Technology - where would we be without it.

The day of the show was hectic to say the least. I went to Crystal's to prep her makeup and give her a lift to the event. We had a makeup/hair time slot at around 3:30 but I had no idea what the exact time was. So we decided to get there early. Good thing too. The schedule had been thrown out the window and it was all first come first serve with these amazing yet possibly overwhelmed stylists. We managed to get Crystal in soon after we got there with the head hair stylist and she knew exactly what to do with her. CRIMP! Big hair with crimping and the hair clip I made to match the dress.

Tarek Mehanna, a 29-year-old American Muslim, was held on trial April 12 to be sentenced to 17 years in prison for supporting ‘terrorist groups.’ His conviction is the epitome of the downfall of the First Amendment. Around ten years and seven months ago, Islam became synonymous with ‘terrorism,’ and Muslims with ‘Jihadists.’ Our basic rights are perishing as Muslims have been under the radar ever since 9/11.

Also, as twins, my sister and I often had to share candy (especially Skor bars, our favorite). But it was hard for us. "She got the bigger piece!" we would both protest. My parents' solution, whenever we had to share food, was to let one sister break the bar in half and the other choose the piece. That way, you broke it evenly and were always satisfied with your piece. Problem solved.
So much for the check of the people…
The Boers in Natal then went and joined their fellow Boers in the Orange Free State and the Transvaal, which had in the meantime been put on the road to nationhood as well. Although there were other indigenous peoples living in parts of these territories, the Boers were accepted by them as another indigenous people and it is worthwhile to note that very few major clashes took place between the Boers and the Black peoples of this time. When such clashes did take place, they were usually over matters such as stock or grazing - at a time very normal matters for indigenous peoples to argue over.

I have noticed that everything lists Weight Watchers points on it now. Everything. You can look up food online or pick it up in a store and even pick up many restaurant menus and see the number of WW points for each item. This, of course, helps those who utilize WW to stay within their point range and ultimately lose weight (ideally).
My fabric was 54″ across and 78.7″ length. I chose this measurement because i needed enough to cover the front of my chair and I also need to have enough fabric left over to wrap around to the sides and bottom of the chair. About 10″ I left around the sides, you can decide how much you will leave depending on what suits your style of chair.

So he stumbles into a zoo and sees all these awesome animals he has never seen before. Flamingos and polar bears and seals and he starts to feel insecure about himself. Like maybe he should be like one of these animals instead. So he changes himself into them. He wants to be handsome like the flamingo, funny like a seal, tall like a giraffe and he ends up a mish-mashed mess of all the animals combined. Suddenly a fly comes near. He is hungry but can’t catch the fly. He has the trunk of an elephant instead of a sticky lizard tongue and so he makes the final wish to change back into himself. He does this and catches the fly. RAINBOWS!! No, really, the last page is a rainbow.

I really talk to them a lot about how to manage groups, and this class has mostly gotten very good at it. I try not to assign roles unless absolutely necessary, because it is such a great opportunity for them to practice peaceful conflict management. One of the easiest tips is just teaching them to use Rock, Paper, Scissors (Ro Sham Bo) as an easy, clear decision tool.
The other instance that comes to mind is the boys 400 meter final at the California State Championships of 1987 where Steve Lewis - one of the biggest favorites in meet history - was tossed out for a false start. Like in Texas today the crowd went nuts, until finally the starter reinserted Lewis in the race. Lewis simply went out and beat the field by a country mile in 46.7 over second place 47.2. Again the second start of the race was even for all with no one getting an advantage.
Nina's stage persona is pretty threatening, I suppose, a pioneer of punk-rock, rubber-faced, sharp-edged at times, but fully female from the start. She did not grow up in short pants as Nikolaus, and go under the knife in later years.

Since the panic had not yet receded, after I said goodnight I began researching whether there was a developmental stage at which children viewed their parents as gods, all the while thinking age ten had to be too late for such a stage. What I found was an assumption that children had been taught to believe in a specific god (which read like the Christian god), and, from there, that the type of parenting they experienced affected the ways in which they viewed that god within their life experience (primarily as authoritarian or forgiving). So, if you’re neither taught to believe or not to believe in a spiritual entity, but you are taught that many people, including some Unitarian Universalists, do believe, then maybe you skip the whole supernatural question and just put your outsized faith in an affirming parent for a while. Perhaps my Religious Education friends have thoughts.
For the past eight years, John Raley, of the Houston firm Raley & Bowick, has spent thousands of hours pro bono as Morton’s lawyer. “There were fingerprints on the sliding glass door, and there were fingerprints on the luggage that was piled on Christine Morton’s body,” he says.

So there we have it, longer runs and picking up the pace this week. The next three weeks bring me up to 16 miles before stepping back and running the Cowtown Half.

I turn to face you and look into your sexy eyes, my mouth slightly open, ready for you. One of your fingers traces my lips and I take your hand so I can suck that finger into my waiting mouth. My tongue rubs underneath it and I close my eyes, concentrating only on you and your finger. I move to the next one, and the next until I have soaked each one. I hold your head in my hands and pull you to kiss me. The moment your lips touch mine, that all too familiar rush of adrenaline forces itself through my body and I groan. We kiss, can’t get enough of one another. As I kiss you, my hands are unconsciously ruffling your hair; I can’t get enough of wanting you. My desire for you is like a fever in my own private thoughts. It burns me up; I can’t contain myself and ask you to lie down.
Even if there are some days when I think my life would have been better/easier had I never met you, I don’t for one hot second regret everything we had and have gone through. I wouldn’t trade it. There are many times when I wish I could go through an Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind type reprogramming, but in the end, I want to remember. Because along with remembering all the bad (which is teaching me something), I can remember the good (which gives me hope).

I never liked Q as much when he started turning up on DS9 or Voyager, when the producers started to explore the entire 'Q Continuum' and the politics thereof, which had the unfortunate effect of turning Q into, well, another in a long series of alien races with their own concerns and whatnot. When he was by himself (for the most part), Q something unique unto himself.

Hyde himself offers eight possible roles for spatial practitioners: the community enabler (or "custodian of the built environment"), the visionary pragmatist, the trans-disciplinary integrator, the social entrepreneur (motivated by the "powerful narrative potential of architectural communication in catalyzing complex visions for the future"), the practicing researcher, the long-term strategist, the management thinker, and the unsolicited architect.
Wei recalled that looting and killing had started almost immediately following the crash back in China but the outlaws had been quickly quelled by the PLA and PAP – just as quickly as the protesters on their way to Tiananmen Square.
Of course I could have had the standard bifocal, but it would be readily apparent to anyone looking at me that I was wearing two lenses. Is it vanity that made me go for the progressive lens? Hmm... quite possibly so.
The agreement should specify how the licensor will bill and collect for any machinery sold to the licensee, and for such items as operating manuals, blueprints, drawings, manufacturing, specifications, test equipment or devices supplied by licensor to licensee. Such charges may apply for quantities that exceed an agreed-on level to be exchanged initially for no added payment.
Now to the present. And to the present president Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. I will be stupid if I start to mention all the atrocities trailing his government, like you are oblivious of them all. I only hope it won’t become anarchical. It is more than unfortunate that even he that promised a breath of fresh air is fainting in asphyxia. It is akin to the typical joke of a medicine-man hawking medicine that would cure cough, yet he himself is losing his voice to coughing. Search my archive, I have never used insulting words against Mr. President, not even the ‘cluelessness’ that is almost replacing the ‘C’ in the GCFR…and you hear Grand Clueless in Chief….bla..bla..

One day, she said she had to leave. I don’t remember why. I think she had to go home to take care of her father. Some of my relatives speculated that she was going to get married. Before she left I made her a terracotta thing that spelled her name. I gave it to her even if it wasn’t dry. It looked like brown poop, but I wanted to give it to her. From then on, I didn’t talk to the maids anymore because I was afraid that I’ll get attached and they’ll leave.

What I loved most about the film, and that I found the most fascinating and moving - was Jiro's personal story, and his relationships with his sons. When Jiro's dad's business failed, he turned to alcohol, leaving his 9 year old son to find his own means to survive. There wasn't much detail about why his mom disappeared from his life, but Jiro gained his work ethic early - there was no safety net, and failure was not an option. He choose sushi, and dedicated his life to his craft. He does not feel that he is alive, unless he is working - even now at the age of 85, when most men have retired. He intends to keep going until he simply can't anymore, or as he playfully states, until his customers think he looks so 'demented' / senile that they no longer want to see him at the restaurant. As a father, he passes on this work ethic to his sons - and it is a testament to the filmmaker's skill - that the portrait of Jiro is as well balanced as the flavors we presume in his exquisite rolls - Jiro is seen confessing his absence from his family when his boys were growing up. If he was on rare occasion home for the night, the kids would ask their mother "who the strange man is". Yet his love and pride for his sons though not expressed in a way that would be familiar to westerners, are clear, and mutual - both have stepped up to learn their father's craft and have prepared most of their lives, under his mentorship - to succeed him and hopefully carry on his legacy.
Getting to the trail head from the city we lived in meant about a two and a half hour drive, so we decided to maximize our three day weekend by getting a early start. I had my Camero loaded and ready for the drive. It should be noted that this was not one of my brightest moments in history. You see this wonderful American made piece of automotive technology had a habit of dying at stop signs and burning through oil faster than a hummingbird on steroids going after nectar. Oh, and did I mention that we would be driving the last hour of our trip on a gravel road through the foothills in a sports car? OK so now you know I'm not exactly a rocket scientist, but hey, I was younger then and figured I had thought through parts one and two already. I threw three quarts of oil behind the front seat and figured we weren't going to encounter a lot of cross traffic at stop signs up in the hills.
Pull out of all the metaphors and cliches for this one. What may have been the greatest ( in terms of vitriol and public attention) rivalry in the history of pop music, Blur vs Oasis, the Gallagher brothers vs Albarn, may have come to end. OK, it’s not even been an issue for years, but the “end” of which I speak may be, in fact, a new beginning of… wait for it… collaboration. Yes, you read that right: collaboration.
Today all we can really do is hope that the authorities able to make decisions make them wisely, and that those attempting to overcome obstacles find creative insight.

For the few living on the negative side of this Life Path, a 3 may be so delighted with the joy of living they become frivolous and superficial. You may scatter your abilities and express little sense of purpose. The 3 can be an enigma, for no apparent reason you may become moody and tend to retreat.

Guard against being critical of others, impatient, intolerant, or overly optimistic.

I beg you not to forget the parents involved in or affected by your ministry in some way, shape, or form. Maybe that means you plan a parents night out where you simply offer to watch their kids while they go out on a date. Or maybe you have a parents event where you dote on them, and maybe even have their kids serve them for a change in roles. Whatever this means for you and your youth ministry, we cannot be neglecting one of the most crucial parts of family ministry – the backbone and foundation – the parents. Whether or not your church offers things for parents to get recharged or not, I challenge you to find ways to recharge them also.
Now that I’ve shared more than you ever wanted to know about me, I’d like to add that I find the other authors’ answers fun and interesting and appreciate them sharing with our readers. We are all individuals and just as we write in different genres, so also do we celebrate our victories differently. But I did notice that many of us celebrate with “food, family and friends,” as has been the custom of human beings from time immemorial (even Maggie’s cruises are centered around food and family). Some things never change…

What I can tell people is every story is read and dully considered, but (and I know this is the case elsewhere) a poor opening that fails to hook and then doesn’t get any better, will not be read entirely. I read as much as I can, because part of me hopes it was a bad start and the rest is great. But I have to tell you that is rare. And for a competition certainly, a poor opening and poor hook that stops me by page 4, is not going to make the cut. It might shock some to know this is what we do, that we read and read until we know for sure this isn’t working. Most we do read all of the story though and with this comp the standard was high so there weren’t many that failed to get me past page 4. But when you have so many stories to read and there are plenty of better ones, I am sorry to say this is the process. Am I being too honest? Perhaps, perhaps I should be keeping some of the mystery of the process, but how will that help anyone?

As we enter the long predicted double dip recession period and business once again cuts all funding that it feels is necessary to enable it to survive; we, learning and development professionals must ask the question. Could this be the end of traditional learning as we understand it? Certainly there has been a huge shift in terms of training methods over the past few years, but the much heralded e-learning hasn’t really gripped the business world as it was predicted it would. Virtual classrooms, web-based learning , email training packages, CD Rom’s and interactive video’s are all out there and being used, but the vast majority of learning is still delivered using traditional methods and as these carry a cost, often a cost that companies chose to jettison, shouldn’t we be looking at ways of delivering more at less cost?

3. Don’t expect overnight results. If you think you can sign up for all the social media sites tonight and have your dream job or thousands of loyal new customers tomorrow, you are living in Fantasy Land. Virtual relationships are as much work as real-life ones—and they should be. People want to work with and help people they care about, and that extends to the online world. I can’t help everyone in my social-media circle, so I let the selfish, impatient ones weed themselves out and instead focus my time on those who engage in a consistent and meaningful way.

The chapter that I chose to read for the final post from the New Media Reader was Chapter 44: The Fantasy Beyond Control by Lynn Hershman. This chapter talks about the creation of interactive movies through link following. Interactivity and link following allows the viewer to connect with the art or video in a new way. Therefore, establishing new and alternate meanings. She talks about interactivity and links gives the user freedom to view text without predetermined sequences.
Your instincts are wrong. Animals rely on instincts for their daily survival, but we are not beasts. We are not lions or sharks of vultures. We are civilised and civilisation only works if instincts are suppressed. So, do your bit for society and ignore those dark desires inside you.
I am sitting here thinking about school tomorrow...wait...wait a minute!! I DO NOT HAVE SCHOOL TOMORROW! Woo Hoo!! I am on Spring Break all week peeps! Now, don't take this the wrong way.

Oh the crush. Remember in high school, that one particular person you kept dreaming about--you couldn't get them out of your mind. Yeah, those days. The thing about a crush is whoever it is they make an impression that's keeps you thinking about them. I've been thinking about this in relation to books. I'm not talking about those books that you would read over and over till your eyes bleed because the MC and story and writing were just that awesome. I'm talking about secondary characters, you know, those characters who make you crush on them (Patch (Hush, Hush) and Jay (The Body Finder) come to mind).

Our cultural beliefs have changed and as long as we look for ways to fulfill our lives I believe they’ll keep changing. Holding onto a mentality that says you have to have the newest or biggest this, this and that just because your friend or neighbor has one isn’t living your true life. Think of it this way you’re walking the midway of the local state fair being heckled from both sides by guys and gals (marketers) saying their game (company/brand) is the best, their prizes (products & services) are bigger and better and your odds of winning are higher with this game over that other game (yea right!). It all boils down to a simple human choice are you going to take the left fork which takes you down Jones’ road where you’re bombarded and influenced by others, or the right fork on which you live your own true life being happy with what and who you choose to have in your life.

But let’s not run away screaming from it yet. According to the Mayo Clinic, Vitamin C is known to do more than combat cold symptoms.

And as everyone at the meeting shifted down into writing or drawing as a means of expressing the grief present for them, I froze. Images of Lily alone in her shining land seared into my mind...I could draw that...images of me alone and unable to reach her...I could draw that..but you know, I couldn't. I knew that the meeting ended in the not too distant future, and I just couldn't dive into that huge well of pain and emotion and then drag myself out again and drive home. Maybe I should've, but I didn't . I ran out in a rather sudden and dramatic way.
3. (C) Meles thanked Hunt for his observations, and then pointed to the structural imbalance between the TFG and the CIC. He said the TFG is disadvantaged by the lack of a motivating force because it is not clan based. This means that TFG President Youseff must negotiate everything among the clans, thus there is little cohesion. Worse, without the motivation of clan or ideology the TFG will remain weak in the face of its enemies. Permanently shifting clan alliances

Of course it was very nice to see it there. The problem was that I couldn't actually believe it. My publisher hadn't mentioned anything to me, and when I checked the Lancashire Book of the Year website they hadn't even put this year's shortlist up yet. There was no mention of the shortlist for 2012 anywhere else online. As it was a Sunday, I couldn't email anyone at my publisher about it, either. So I decided not to get too happy. These things have been mistakes before.
Any regiment ending its move in contact with an enemy regiment is by definition charging. Regiments can only charge enemies that are in its LOS at the start of their activation. Charge contact can only be made with the front side of the charging regiment’s base, against one of the target’s sides (any side, just not a corner). Neither the rear, nor sides, nor any corner of the charger can be used to contact an enemy regiment. A regiment must stop at least 1cm away from an enemy if it cannot charge it. It is perfectly normal to pivot after moving in contact with an enemy using a corner, if the regiment has enough Speed left (“closing the door” move in other wargames rules).

Our desire to touch the dead, to adorn them in their Sunday best and wish them a final farewell, is the human process of gathering similar information. It is a way to reconcile our deep familiarity with the body of our loved ones with the realization that what they may once have been is no more. I’m not even certain that we have a concept of death beyond what we can tell from directly comparing what is different between the living and the dead. I certainly didn’t as a ten-year-old child shuffling past my grandfather’s coffin. In my desire to touch his cold hand I may have been fulfilling a need that many animals experience when confronted with their own realization of death. Whether it’s a chimpanzee mother carrying her dead infant on her back, or what the New York Times reported of the woman from Plainfield, New Jersey who “talked to her dead infant as though it was alive” as she rode the crowded rail car home, the effect may be to ease our minds towards acceptance. For regardless of where we started in life, we all end up in the same place. Death is the great unifier and as we reach out to touch the dead, we are ultimately connecting with everyone else who is struggling to let go.

The label art again has a very interesting style to it, giving me thoughts of Charlie Daniels ‘Devil went down to Georgia’. The side of the bottle has a little tale on it illuminating the tale to the image. “Here”s to Daniel Lapp, Oliver Schroer, ELH, and all great fiddlers. Libation and music, like the tumultuous marriage of malt and hops, stand waiting with us at the crossroads. And look: here comes the Devil, whistling past the graveyard, singing in the midnight choir, bottle in one hand, a fiddle in the other, and that crazy smile…”
it originates from our ego, inner devil, etc…. you may call it what ever you want… but it is there….
Although it is a coming of middle-age story, the coming of age aspect was very well served by the youngest member of the cast Ryan Andrews, whose worries about the future and “studying” for his leaving, which generally involved playing on his laptop, were both hilarious and heartrending, His father delivered the wonderful line about the more qualifications he had the further he would have to emigrate! Ryan’s fantastically natural performance and ability to convey the character so well make him an actor to watch out for in the future. Indeed my 14 and 16 year old teens, who were a bit grumpy about coming out in the rain, thoroughly enjoyed the play as did the teens sitting behind us.
My first trial turned into several oval shaped crackers. The next trial the bread was tough, chewy, and tasteless. Yuck.

We were supposed to reach the border just in time during its opening hours, with travel time of 6-8 hours, but we got to the border super ahead of time because our driver was such a speed racer and was able to breeze through the highways, motorways, and expressways of Thailand in just 3 hours! Because we were so early, we had to wait in Aranyaprathet police station around 4 am to 7 am just in time to cross the border in Poipet.

I first became acquainted with the conjoined Hilton Twins from the spectacular movie Freaks (1932), directed by the great Tod Browning (Dracula, The Unholy Three). They played the only thing they could play: themselves. Joined at the hip, the Hilton Twins had to do everything together. A popular vaudeville act they were used to being billed as a novelty, but one thing you definitely notice when watching them in both Freaks and Chained for Life is that they are very natural and there really isn’t anything “freakish” about them. Chained for Life (director Harry Fraser’s last film) has Violet and Daisy Hilton starring as conjoined Vaudeville singing act, Vivian and Dorothy Hamilton (not too big a stretch with the names there). The movie is a sort of flashback from a trial. Vivian has murdered her sister Dorothy’s husband, but the courts are not sure how to prosecute the guilty party while sparing the innocent. Through the many testimonial flashbacks we see how it all happened. Dorothy was conned into a publicity marriage by her manager (played by Allen Jenkins who I mainly remember as being the elevator guy in Pillow Talk) and a slick double-crossing stage magician, Andre Pariseau (Mario Laval). The movie depicts Dorothy’s longing to be separated so she can have a normal life, Vivian’s shrewdness and ardent distrust for Andre, and Andre’s two-timing. The courts refuse to let Dorothy obtain a marriage license because they would consider it bigamy. They are outraged, but they make it swing with a blind minister. After the publicity marriage Andre dumps Dorothy and Vivian vengefully murders him. The film avoids resolution and instead tries to stump the audience with its bookend scenes of the judge (Norval Mithcell) openly asking the audience how he should rule.

As I shift through the dregs of everything that happened I can’t help but feel let down, rejected and stupid.

But names are really the least of our worries; the larger issue with the BCS is that it's decidedly unfair.

Both of these are perfect for romantic young girls and boys who are sensible enough not to mind a bit of romance.

I really like listening to ‘Last Scene’, ‘Don’t Fade Away’ and ‘Fall Apart’ very much, though it needed some time before I got used to them. I got too much absorbed listening to their 1st and 2nd album. However, Dear Cloud put their signature on the songs quite well. The tunes, the vocal, the lyrics… were nice. However, I really have to wait for the real EP on August 5 to give a fair and complete judgment. Since they said that they are on their own now, I hope that they can give the fans a return that is worth to wait. Summer is definitely going to be great!

As some of you may be aware, I run a very busy schedule. Last semester between work, classes, placements, running LEAP, and trying to get a decent amount of sleep every night I didn’t have any free time, period.

Some people - the lefties inhabiting the Media, for example - believe a priori that Mankind is destroying the planet with our pollution. The Global Warming theory - with its emphasis on CO2 to the exclusion of other, more important Greenhouse gases - is congenial to their pre-existing belief that society must fundamentally de-industrialize. The theory gives them a scientific veneer to pretty-up their beliefs. The actual details of the science are quite beside the point.

Think Noah And The Whale, Laura Marling, Mumford And Sons and you get the picture. “Last Smoke Before The Snowstorm” is his fine debut of dreamy, soft focus folk. The songs don't demand your attention, they don't reach out to grab you, (I get the impression there's not a lot of AC/DC or Extreme Noise Terror currently on his turntable!) but that's missing the point. There's a subtlety that draws you in, more of a whisper in the ear rather than shouting from the rooftops.

CONCLUSIONS
Here's the story behind my layout. We have a beagle named Lexi. She was given to our youngest daughter for her 19th birthday by a boyfriend. Six months earlier, we had lost our Yorkie of 14 years, and of course I was still grieving over her. When our daughter brought Lexi into our house late one night, wrapped in a towel, she weighed 2 1/2 pounds. She was the cutest little puppy ever! But, I told my daughter that her Dad would not allow her to keep her. She kept her in her bedroom for 3 days before he knew about her. When she finally showed Lexi to him, he told her that she could not keep the dog. She asked if she could keep her until she could find a home for the puppy, and my husband agreed to that. Of course she never found a home for her -- because she never tried! During the time that Lexi was a puppy, our daughter was never home, and she became my responsibility. Then at age 22, our daughter got married. Her husband is not a dog lover and would never have a dog in the house. So, Lexi officially became my dog. You can read my journaling below.

He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green.

Guinsoo: Yeah, thanks man.
It was originally $35, marked down to $25, and we talked them down to $18. Andi says it looks like it's mid-century modern. I don't know what that means. I call it mid-century awesome. Do I use the word awesome enough?

London's firefighters celebrate: Coleman is gone
Sixty-five years later, Foster is trim, sharp and carries himself as a former military officer.
Today's weight. 9st 2lb. ( still at target ).
In typical Leftist kneejerk fashion, the first appearance in court by Breivik was held in secret, which is contrary to Norwegian custom, as I understand it.
Last year Dallas PD established a unit to review daschcam video, the Dallas News reported, but has suspended the program "because officers felt they were being nitpicked with disciplinary action for minor infractions" ("Dallas police to suspend squad car video reviews due to officers' complaints," April 23). Here's the list of nitpicky offenses the local union says shouldn't be monitored in that way:
I'll be leaving the blog public, so there's access to the archives. A lot of stuff, when I look back through my blogging history, embarrasses me, but there are some quality posts, too.
-reuse chalkboard contact paper on refrigerator and to make tags
What they DON’T write in the book, is to stick the dough in the freezer until it gets hard enough to scoop, because I didn’t know to do that, and my cookies were falling apart when I dropped them on the tray. And I was tired, and annoyed, and I had a baby tantrum lol.
I was about to try and respond to all the comments, but I was in the Pacific time zone this morning, and well. It was going to be a lot of bland stuff. I'll get back on track. But I think all y'all, my very good, treasured blogger friends will appreciate, I checked this before I even checked Facebook.
just like we knew Saddam had nukes, and Roosevelt was a Jew.
I had first seen him when I was in 7th grade. He was older and more mature...an 8th grader, and didn't know I existed, although I did catch him checking out my legs once or twice. For years, I had a secret love affair with him that he didn't know about. Well, maybe he did...OK, by the end of high school he would have been a total idiot to not have known, which, I heard he kind of was. Anyway, I was a cheerleader and he was a football player, so I got to see him on the bus every week and cheer my head off for him at games. I knew which way he would be coming after his classes so I made sure I was there talking to a friend so I could see him in the hallway. Hoping...praying that he would see me one day, realize his love for me and we would ride off into the sunset in his Camaro.

Such a great place, Key West. We went shopping on Duval Street and stopped at Hog's Breath Saloon for drinks and a snack. My favorite places were Schooner Wharf Bar and Irish Kevin's Bar. The live music was the best. We enjoyed checking out the streets off the beaten paths of the touristy area. Don and I agreed it would be easy to spend the rest of our days there.
Will you forgive me for my absence? I've been itching to post on my blog, but life has thrown a major curve-ball at me since November. We had water damage in the house and we are presently renovating, hence my absence. Of course, all this had to coincide with my coming out in December, so things have been very hectic. But the good news is I'll be getting a new office. I'll have my own space to work, which will be better than what I had before. My previous office was in my bedroom and I was literally living in that one room! It will feel good to sleep in one space and work in another. Knowing myself, I always give 100% of my energy and attention to a project. This one being so big, I am trying to get it done, so that I can concentrate on writing Defenders of the Grimoire (Book 2 of the Grimoire series).
Try harder and you should be able to hear the battle cry of Alexander’s troops as they ready themselves to attack India’s North-western frontier – Gandhar, or the present day Afghanistan (capital: Kandahar); if you press your ear to the ground, you might even hear the clappity-clap of the horse-hooves; and if you have a discerning ear, you should also be able to hear the snores of his tired soldiers, randomly punctuated by mysterious thuds. These thuds, in fact, were caused by the sleepy soldiers who fell off their horses, every once in a while.
