this is going to be the event of the year and not to be missed
I moved to a new city in Feb,2011. As soon as we moved, I started looking for a job right away. Networking, meeting people – the usual job search routine. Somewhere when the job search had picked up momentum, I found out that I was pregnant. Now that got me thinking what should I do – Should I tell people I am pregnant or should I just stay quiet. I read a lot of posts online regarding how to break the news of my pregnancy - should one of my searches materialize and decided I will take a call when the time comes. However in reading these posts, I realized that it was illegal for anyone to discriminate on the basis of my pregnancy and that I had every right not to tell them of my situation. However, a lot of people had taken the offer in hand and before accepting let the manger know that they were pregnant. Most of them had all ended up with their jobs and the situation seemed all good.

Thanks again everyone who has read, commented, tweeted, linked, emailed, and everything else so far. Big props to those I interacted with early on, and extra thanks to those who reached out when I was still a pseudonymous blogger, and gave me some much appreciated early encouragement. It has been an honor to be able to try and make sense of the biggest economic collapse since the Great Depression, the efforts to reform and rein in Wall Street, the political environment of the first term of the Obama administration as well as any type of future for progressive politics here with all of you, and I will do my best to continue to do so at the next space.
"How?" I would have done anything.
Markets generally pulled back today with only the NASDAQ fighting to stay positive. Commodities were lower as US crude inventories climbed to new highs. Bonds moved a little higher and he loonie was lower.
Arizona lawmakers appear close to sending to Gov. Jan Brewer a tea party-backed bill that proponents say would stop a United Nations takeover conspiracy but that critics claim could end state and cities’ pollution-fighting efforts and even dismantle the state unemployment office. A final legislative vote is expected Monday on a bill that would outlaw government support of any of the 27 principles contained in the 1992 United Nations Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, also sometimes referred to as Agenda 21.

If you’re still feeling zooish, go to Bearizona near Williams which is a drive through. You better keep those windows tightly closed and keep moving through because those bears are not shy of humans as a swipe at our bumper that set the car rocking let us know. This zoo is 55% rescues and rehabilitated animals. I don’t think I’ve ever enjoying a working weekend more.
Our policy has always been that entry to shows is first come first served. Reviewers queue with the rest and there is no special treatment. There are no tickets and there never will be. In situations of particularly high demand we have issued tokens to the queue, thus allowing it to wait in more comfort and not stand for an hour; this is still first come first served.

This marks the second departure from The SteelDrivers’ original line-up. Chris Stapleton, the group’s lead singer, signed off at the end of 2009. Stapleton’s growling vocals and brooding lyrics largely defined the band’s style, and there were those who felt that the jig was up as soon as he packed up his guitar and split.

This shouldn't just be a day off from school for all the children in the household. This should be a well thought out process whereby the parent taking the child to work should be interested in actually imparting some form of interest in work to their young offspring. A way to let kids see that their parents have to be serious in their job, but that they also enjoy going to work because of A, B, and C items.
When I'm lucky, what I'm paying attention to is the writing; the answer to a given plot issue will often pop up--sometimes because some minor element I've written in along the way turns out to be more than merely descriptive, or will fulfill dual roles.
So I thought I do a little post about some dollar store things I used around my house so far this year. I really find some great stuff...
One of the nurses in the NICU asked us if we named Emmett after "the vampire in Twilight." She seemed so excited by the prospect that I felt kind of bad saying no. But seriously, the Twilight connection almost made us NOT use the name.
I think that the key is to not expect your home community to be Buenos Aires, or to compare it to Buenos Aires. That is not fair, there is no possible way your home tango could stand up to Buenos Aires. Mecca is Mecca and no place else can come close. So to constantly compare the two can only lead to disappointment and depression. In my mind anyway. Maybe that is a bit Pollyanna of me, but it is how I am approaching this re-acclimation.
A great technique for getting a kid to talk is to MOVE. Children, especially boys, can have a hard time expressing their feelings if they feel like an adult is standing there, waiting for an answer, and “pressuring” them to say something. If you can remove the child from the situation and go for a walk (ideally outdoors), the questions you ask may elicit more than the standard, “I dunno” answers.

Probing beyond the courtroom reveals a whole array of doors and avenues to explore. Before anyone can move, every door slams shut, sealed. Smoke issues forth from everywhere and the temperature rises. Voice are heard in the distance, screaming for help, to be saved. Sir Horace leads the escape, breaking through one door. And suddenly all is normal again.
Prohibitionists claim that “sex trafficking” decreases when prostitution is criminalized and increases when it is legalized or decriminalized; the Netherlands is one of their favorite targets, and here Wendy Lyon of Feminist Ire demonstrates that recent statistics fail to support prohibitionist claims, and that what “trafficking” there is seems more the fault of Dutch controls than of the sex trade itself.

Shakalakaboomboom’s owner lives next to Punchestown racecourse in County Kildare and commutes to London, where he works in the property business. He had a share with a few friends in Boomshakalaka when trainer Nicky Henderson told him that the horse’s three-parts brother was selling at Doncaster sales in May, 2008. “I said to bid for him if he didn’t make too much and Minty (bloodstock agent David Minton) got him for £20,000,” recalls Breslin, who says that Aintree has been on the agenda since last year. “It’s been very much an upward curve with him and we’ve found out since he won Punchestown last year that he was such a good stayer. We really started thinking about Aintree after he won the same race at Cheltenham in December that Mon Mome had landed the season he won the National. We missed the Cheltenham Festival and kept him fresh for Saturday.” Shakalakaboomboom is the best performer that Breslin has owned and he also has horses with Conor Dore in Britain and a number of jumpers in Ireland with the likes of Arthur Moore, Bill Harney and Tom Cooper. No previous John Smith’s Grand National runners.

Najib’s averseness to accommodate and clean the electoral process will incur the wrath of the people. The urban voters who are generally educated are aware of the significance of having fair and free elections. But a huge number of rural voters are those who are not yet fully aware of the importance this process. This is the swirl UMNO will exploit to the fullest to sink the Opposition and justify why it should not meet all the demands sought by Bersih.

Offshore seismic testing is used to discover petroleum and natural gas reserves. Seismic surveys usually involve the use of an array of powerful air guns that cause a pressure pulse. The resulting noise could disturb animal life, especially that of cetaceans, such as whales, porpoises, and dolphins who use sonar to communicate. Seismic testing can disrupt their sonar, and potentially damage their hearing.

The rickshaw has been stalled for quite some time. Over 9 months to be exact. And with the other two writers, who by the way are much better writers, being far busier in life then myself, the onus has fallen on me to restart it. So I’d like to blame the gas shortage for the lack of our rickshaw making the rounds, but our rickshaw runs on a different sort of fuel – usually cricket.
When I try to talk about any of this with my husband I either get "the wall" or an argument and I don't need that right now.

It’s true that corporations have helped our country in the past, but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. The government has gone to the extreme, putting corporations ahead of the American people. The battle in Washington seems to have more to do with taking care of corporations rather than the needs of the people.
This drew not only the ire of British ecological geneticists, who thought I was both unfair and unnecessarily dismissive of a classic story (I stood by my guns here), but predictably attracted creationists and other evolution-deniers, who found in the weaknesses of the Biston story a lack of evidence for natural selection (ignoring all the other cases that were well supported), and, indeed, a conspiracy by evolutionists to prop up a tale they knew was wrong! Judith Hooper, a science journalist, wrote an execrable book claiming that Kettlewell committed deliberate fraud designed to buttress Darwinism, and that evolutionists were complicit in this coverup. I trashed Hooper’s dreadful book in another review in Nature (if you want a pdf, email me). Kettlewell was not a fraud, just a naturalist who wasn’t that good at experimental design.
"Hey Sam!" I hollered over to my twelve-year old, who was in the next room.
Deborah was born in Charleroi, Pennsylvania on March 18, 1956, the daughter of Frank and Blanche Palfrey. Mercifully, Frank Palfrey died in 2002 and so was not forced to endure his daughter’s lynching by his government, but Fate allowed her mother no such kindness; she was the person who discovered the lifeless body of her first-born. The Palfreys moved to Orlando, Florida, but returned to Charleroi in 1966; this was not a happy homecoming for Deborah, who was bullied so mercilessly she eventually asked for and received her parents’ permission to finish high school in Florida. She earned a degree in criminal justice from Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, then paralegal credentials from a law school in San Diego. But after a few years at this grind she learned what so many women do: that far from being a liberation as many second-wave feminists pretend, a career can be stifling to the point of unendurability. In the ‘80s she became a cocktail waitress, then an escort, but discovered (as I did a decade later) that criminalization allows seedy, sleazy escort services to flourish, and so decided to start her own agency.

It's nearly three in the morning and I'm still up, again. What would I tell the people at the ER? I can't sleep, I have anxiety? Because these are medicines they dole out so generously at the emergency room these days, yes? All this makes me want to do is two things: switch to a new therapist and switch to a new psychiatrist. I think I need a doctor who is part of a group who will have a nurse or an on call doctor call me back when I am having problems such as this right now.

Knowing of no other children who could, Morgan hated playing outside just slightly less than she loved it. It was even worse during cold weather, especially at her father’s house.

CASINO plays with your expectations of what a Bond movie “should be” a bit here and there, both for comedic effect and to highlight how this film is going in a new direction. When Bond first meets Vesper, she tells him, “I’m the money” and he dryly replies that she’s “worth every penny of it.” Later, when a bartender asks him if he wants his martini “shaken or stirred,” Bond angrily snaps back, “Does it look like I give a damn?”

However, far from expressing sheer gratitude, Cyril constantly finds ways to abuse and overextend Samantha’s graciousness and soon comes into a bad way. His propensity for anger and violence, which first begins with a desire to protect his bike from one of the thieving boys in the neighborhood, gradually turns into something much darker and malevolent.

In the 1930s, decades before to the property’s expropriation, the Bigio family had leased it to Coca-Cola, which was “fully aware that the property had been stolen from the family without compensation,” the family’s lawyers said. Wednesday’s appeal filing comes after the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York dismissed Bigio’s case against Coca-Cola in March on the grounds that the Bigios had “not sufficiently alleged that the Coca-Cola Company headquarters in the US controlled Coca- Cola Egypt.”

The beginning of the novel starts the reader off with lengthy history or world-building. The author pores on and on about details of a city or civilization or some alien history all to “set up” the story.
“We have taken action to protect children. We have taken action to protect adults,” Griffo said. “Our work is not complete unless we take further action that will ensure animals are not mistreated unto death by people who should not be allowed to ever, ever own an animal again and who should be paying the full price for intentionally treating a companion animal in such a way that has led to death.”

Then she dropped the magazines that had been perched on her lap. Without thinking, I reached down, scooped up the scattered pages and handed them back to her. She thanked me and said, “You’re so kind.” I didn’t feel very kind, however. I felt ashamed that my first instinct was to avoid all contact. I decided to remedy that. I smiled and we started talking. I learned that she’d been a chemistry major back in the day and she had to walk upstairs to do her labs and a girl in her class had had polio and couldn’t walk so every day, four guys would carry her upstairs so she could participate in the labs, and bathroom doors are too heavy, and the train tracks from here to Louisiana were damaged in Hurricane Katrina and hadn’t been repaired yet, and if she was running the world, things would be different. The conversation was mostly one-sided, but I think she was just happy to have someone to listen to her chatter.

If you’re confident you have a great story, and if you only do one thing, get it edited by a professional. You can do this for $300-$400 (USD). Handing it around to your mates and critique groups doesn’t count. Professional editors are good at this, that’s all they do and will find things you never even thought about. They will kick your MS into good shape and prepare it for market.

Using techniques for predicting social wants, at present prostituted to the service of capital, socialist society can work out how much and what sort of products and services will be needed over a given period. Men and women will be free to discuss what they would like to be produced. So with social research and after democratic discussion an estimate of what is needed can be made. The next problem is to arrange for these amounts to be produced. Capitalism, in modern computing machines, input-output analysis and information technology, has developed the techniques which socialist society can use.
“But what I’ve heard these last several days—and in the responses I’ve seen from young adults who have interacted with this just a little bit so far—is that it’s a foundational way for young adults who haven’t made the connection between Jesus Christ and world-changing mission. That brings me a lot of hope, particularly for those people who are hardest to reach, because they aren’t already in our doors.”

He said he wondered why he had even told me the story because he hadn't thought about it for years . But even after all this time, it was obvious that it had been a deep cutting remark that stayed with him. I asked if he wouldn't perhaps write the story now, since the idea was obviously one he was still taken by.
Any economist worth their salt will tell you that in order for a market system to function properly all externalities must be properly accounted for. Externalities like the social costs of child labor or the environmental costs of pollution. Much of the sickness of our current markets is the routine avoidance of incorporating externalities into the market’s cost structures. Ensuring that these externalities are accounted for is a necessary role of government, one which few governments in the world are even attempting and even fewer are doing reasonably well.

It is common knowledge that Pakistani judges, fearing for their lives, generally refrain from convicting high-profile jihadists with political connections. When, in the face of compelling evidence, a judge has no option but to order the sentence enjoined by the law, he must either live under guard afterwards or leave the country. Such was the case with Judge Pervez Ali Shah who tried Mumtaz Qadri, the jihadist bodyguard who murdered Punjab’s governor Salman Taseer for backing an amendment to the indiscriminately applied blasphemy law. Soon after sentencing Qadri to capital punishment last October, Shah received several death threats and was forced into self-exile.
Well- the sheet last about two minutes. As that was falling down, Cooper turned to the window curtains- we all know what his intent was there! After we let him know that was "not ok" he found how fun it was to throw all of his blankets out of the crib one at at time, followed by his pillow and stuffed monkey. Kevin and I were so good at fetching these! Over and over we would try to convince Cooper that we were all going to bed. We would lay motionless on the bed next to him and before too long I would feel a blanket land on the bed next to me, followed by one on my face and an uproar of laughter and another blanket and a monkey on top of that. When I wouldn't give them back to him, he would cry- mainly because he was tired and because I had ruined his game. Eventually either we would fall asleep or he would and then we could go cover him up.

The bulk of what’s written above applies to McPherson and his trio as well as it does to AS: this is innocent music, pure music. Let’s neither get all Alan Lomaxy, nor let’s pretend that innocence or purity are aspects which automatically lend music power or punch (who hasn’t seen earnest-as-fuck crapshows?). But, again, as with AS, there’s a directness and joy in what McPherson’s doing, or at least that’s what it sounds like to this listener. Here’s what you should maybe know as well: everything used to record and make Signs and Signifiers was made before 1970 (often well before). A move like that could, depending on the seen-it-all world-weariness of the listener, strike as a gimick or schtick—I wonder how I’d feel it, say, The Strokes were to try a stunt like that. I don’t know. I’d claim, though, that McPherson and his bandmates did not endeavor to make an album like Signs and Signifiers out of any avaristic, let’s-look-like-this intent. Who knows, maybe they did, but I doubt it: what it sounds like is they’re into this old-time rock+roll music (which, let’s be real clear: McPherson’s songs could be fucking outtakes from Ray Charles’s magic 1950′s years; I’m not kidding) and they’re trying to make the best old-time rock+roll album they can. Meaning it doesn’t remotely sound like they’re trying to appear any certain way, meaning they are—like the Alabama Shakes—about as rare as it gets in terms of modern bands and music: folks who seemingly, truly, don’t give a shit about coming off any certain way other than trying as hard as they can to get to the sound and idea they’re most moved by. If you think I’m crazy and that this is more common than I’m believing it to be, I’d simply ask: when was the last time you were surprised by music? We talk about Adele with such reverence for a reason, and we did about Amy Winehouse the same way for similar reasons, and we talk about Radiohead for similar reasons. All of these folks? I’d argue that they share an uncompromising, un-self-conscious drive to get to the music they’re most moved by. Holy hell do you owe it to yourself to listen, as do we all.

Many of the surveys they give to you afterwards are opinion based anyways.

Halston was a visionary when it came to licensing as well. He had a carpeting deal, luggage deal, and candle deal just to name a few. He even designed the Olympic uniforms! He also developed a perfume line in which he created the tear shaped bottle with no words on the bottle which became his signature. His ads even had no words. Some say it was because he couldn't come up with the words he wanted to use but I think it was totally genius.

It is also my firm conviction that we need to get rid of both the European Union and the United Nations. At the end of the Cold War, Francis Fukuyama pronounced that we had arrived at "The End of History", and that capitalism and liberal democracy would now be the only global system left. But when I look at Europe today, I see democracies under threat because of an elaborate Eurabian bureaucracy and Islamic fanaticism. I see countries unwilling or unable to defend themselves against massive immigration/colonization, and the possible dawn of neo-barbarism. Has democracy become too soft to function? Have we arrived at "the End of Democracy" instead of "the End of History?" What does it take for a democracy to work? Can you still retain a democracy with massive illegal immigration going on? Is Multiculturalism inherently anti-democratic? Some people claim that the nation state is a redundant concept in a globalized world, but I can't see many democratic societies not based on a nation state. Can you? To me, the EU is the perfect example of how democracy becomes weakened when you try to make an organization above the nation state. And the UN is unacceptable because it allows dictatorships and corrupt non-democratic states to dictate democratic ones. Until we have something better, if ever, the nation state is the best way ever discovered of organizing society to provide the greatest good to the greatest number of people. The problem I think is that people get confused between democracy and human rights. Obviously you can't have pure democracy -- that is just mob rule. As some wag once wrote, "Two wolves voting to eat the sheep." That's why the famous concept of "checks and balances" were built into the US system of government -- to give some protection to the sheep. The framers of the US constitution thought long and hard about pure democracy and recognized its limitations.
The broadening of Communist historical studies will be assisted by the ongoing publications of Historical Materialism Book Series in this field. Two such works were published in 2011: Toward the United Front, containing the annotated proceedings of the Comintern’s month-long Fourth World Congress (1922), and In the Steps of Rosa Luxemburg. Among other such books in preparation is a volume presenting the proceedings of the Comintern’s 1921 world congress.

Next step: Analyze. Determine your comfort zone by what you see a lot of and your fears by what you don’t. Perhaps you have a space filled with rounded shapes, comfy chairs, pillows and throws, lots of neutrals. What are you missing? You want it to feel comfy and relaxing but not boring! Here’s the trick. Your space is craving a tiny touch of the elements you run from. It should be 90/10. You need a few hard edges, some reflective surfaces (maybe a touch of sparkle?), a few shakes of bold color, and Voila! Treat it like a spice. Just a touch will wake up the flavor. Perhaps a mirrored tray, a sleek accent chair, and a bold geometric pattern. Take a color you love and introduce it around the room in small doses to add excitement and energy. One, two, three, done.
Although a Smartphone can easily have the computing power to handle an EMV transaction, and the smartphone is certainly capable of connecting to a variety of wireless, (or contactless) systems, few examples exist of systems that can process an EMV transaction through NFC using all of the ‘chip & PIN’ functionality and protocols that are responsible for the great reduction in face-to-face fraud.
I don't reckon it is REAL if it is not like that.
I admit I love the pioneer mama feeling I get from doing these things around the kitchen. Is it ridiculous to admit I love bringing in the wood for the stove? Oh yes. But I know I love it only because it's optional. One morning last week, as I was lugging in a bunch of logs, I was nearly giddy with the prospect of feeding the fire. I put the wood into the stack by the stove and paused to admire my industry, stopping just short of hooking my thumbs into my pretend overall straps and rocking back on my heels with a self-satisfied, "Yesirree."
My mom was in town this weekend and I always get an extra burst of decorating vigor when she's around. For that reason, Neil is probably happy she's not visiting that often!
This series is scheduled to be 18 books long IIRC ... but with the time between publications, I hope it's finished before I'm like, 50 LOL. I try to NOT anticipate the next book too much because I might end up waiting 2 or 3 years between them.
2008, but he atoned for that fourth place finish with a nice victory at Taunton four weeks later. He was stepped up in class at Ascot on December 19, in the Grade Two Noel Novices’ Chase over two miles and three furlongs and jumped his opponents silly from the front with his only mistake coming at the last when he had the race wrapped up. He was turned out quickly eight days later at Kempton’s Christmas meeting in the Grade Two Wayward Lad Novices’ Chase, but he was very disappointing, pulling up before the third last. This was the first of three disappointing performances at Kempton over fences in Deep Purple’s career to date and Evan Williams revealed he bled on every occasion. After a short absence he returned to the racecourse in early March 2009 at Sandown where he finished second in a four-runner novices’ chase, but he soon got back on track with an easy victory at Hereford 11 days later. On his next start he lined up at Aintree’s John Smith’s Grand National meeting in the Grade Two John Smith’s Manifesto Novices’ Chase and put up a bold display, only finding Tartak too good. He bagged his second Grade Two success of the season at Ayr in the Future Champion Novices’ Chase, routing his rivals to score by nine lengths. The bay gelding returned in fine fettle for the 2009/10 season, capturing the Grade Two Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby and the Grade Two Peterborough Chase at Huntingdon on his first two starts. However a return to Kempton for the King George VI Chase over Christmas saw him break a blood vessel and he was pulled up before the tenth. He wasn’t seen again until March, 2010, in the Grade One Ryanair Chase at the Cheltenham Festival, but he put in a much improved display to finish fourth to the classy Albertas Run. That rival took the spoils again at Aintree in the Grade One John Smith’s Melling Chase, but Deep Purple was beaten over twice as far in sixth suggesting he didn’t run up to his best form. He reappeared in October, 2010, for the Charlie Hall Chase, but he could not emulate his victory from the year before and finished a staying-on third over the three-mile trip. Unfortunately, he unseated on his next outing in the rearranged Peterborough Chase at Newbury in mid December. However he put in a more encouraging display in February

The Pueblo’s Tribal Government is comprised of a Traditional Council. Elected Council seats include a Governor, a Lieutenant Governor, an Aguacil (bailiff or sheriff), and four Council Members. The Council acts as a governing body and approves all major strategic decisions. The Governors also provide administrative oversight of Tribal operations and business. Additional Council seats include a Cacique (Chief) and a Capitan de Guerra (War Captain). These positions are also elected, but are life-long terms. The Cacique and War Captain provide spiritual and traditional guidance. The Tribe is governed by oral tradition as well as the Tribal Code of Laws enforced by the Tribal Police Department and upheld by the Tribal Court.

I am also amazed that I survived this week. My dog, Mabel, also had life changing events. She is now diabetic and started insulin the same day I started my diet. So while I'm eating every 2-2.5 hours, she is drinking water (every hour) and then going for a potty walk (every hour) and getting shots twice a day (glad both me and her are okay with that). It's pretty much insane here, I haven't gotten much of anything done other than food prep and potty walks. My front door reminds me of a clown car at the circus -- in and out, around and around. I guess it is a good thing I work from home. Well, usually work.

There is a big 'problem' in our marriage. I come alive at night as my mind starts running on overdrive while Branden gets tired and his brain hits shut down mode. Since I'm not know to be quiet, we typically chat in bed about whatever random thing is on my mind at the time while Branden tries to keep his mind awake long enough to give me a response. Due to this, I have posted lots of funny bedtime conversations and today I will be sharing yet another one!
Now our family is paying for the cult of the ten minute expert. The cult of the one size fits all assessment of mental competence. And we aren't expert. We know nothing.

In this family. With no outside help.

The author’s taqiyyah manifests itself in his reference to “a literal and immediate application” of the hudud — as if Islamic law allowed for anything other than a literal interpretation of the Koranic punishments. It does not: the gate of ijtihad (interpretation) closed more than a millennium ago, and no revision of the application of the law is now permitted.

“I will be with you” is His promise to us. If everything in this life we cannot hold on to, we must hold on to our relationship with God. When we don’t hold on to that, everything in life are scattered in pieces like a mess, for God alone holds all things together. We can keep knocking, seeking and asking God, but sometimes Jesus is knocking on the door of our heart, saying, open up the door so I might come in … Surrender your idols, make room for ME, and invite me into your heart.

I was having recess alone everyday and i was a victim in my class with bullies ransacking my school bag after recess. I cried but the teacher in the class simply ignored. I remembered praying to God during the school holidays so that the bullies will not harrass me after i start school again! Thank God, I was saved from that very day i prayed! Even as a kid, i hoped that someone could really write me a note to say “Ignore the bullies, you are beautiful!”

About one month ago the goby escaped via the back, top parameter of the tank using a four centimeter gap. While installing an upgrade skimmer (CPR SR3) in the back he was found residing in a compartment housing the tank’s water pump. After two days of trying, he was finally captured and returned to the *allowed* portion of the tank. And a line of narrow sponges now fill the goby’s escape route.

Nah, really, it’s so folks can get photos of them so they can take their photo in front of the White House doors. That was mostly it, and you could tell by all the smiling faces that people were having a great time. I was. But you had to get there really early to avoid the mob. First you had to stand in line to get free tickets to enter the property. Then you had to stand in line to go onto the property. My line time Saturday was about an hour and a half. I arrived at 7:30 a.m. and got in for the first tour at 9.

Suddenly cold, she pulled at the arms of the sweatshirt still tied around her waist. It fell to the sand.

What I see through my DOOM mask and foul-collecting-baggy jersey is strategy and execution. When Bynum knuckles up and stops his condescending-smirk-”got this” pose and uses his body and abilities we get to see a monster amount of block shots and rebounds. And we know he’ll score. Isn’t it great to be so frigid huge to be able to score so easily in one of maybe three ways super close to the rim every frigid time? But throw Gasol beside that and it’s seriously a vicious frontcourt, they hide each other’s areas of address, and can excel at the inside in for easy buckets, then back out to Kobe to finish it off outside if need be (usually the other way around, but i digress). And we know Kobe goes rogue, it’s in his knee-n-a.

They wondered, not unreasonably, whether Hans mightn’t be getting his hoof-tapping cues from somewhere other than his unprecedented equine cognitive powers. No horse had ever shown any signs of this level of mental acuity before, or even anything close. I mean, look at how some of these questions were phrased: “If the eighth day of the month comes on a Tuesday, what is the date of the following Friday?” Now granted, as far as the mathematics goes, we’re still about on a par with modern GCSE papers. But that’s some fairly sophisticated sentence structure there, with the conditional clause and everything, not to mention the background knowledge about our modern calendar that you’d need for it to make any sense. Humans are good at all this, but it’s something we still haven’t had much luck teaching computers to learn, and it’s more than has ever been observed in even the smartest monkeys. And some of those monkeys can put particularly stupid humans to shame. This was seriously big news, if the horse really was that clever.

The new section 102(b) is comparable to EPC Article 55 in defining a disclosure of an invention which is removed from the state of art. The grace period, to take advantage of this exception to remove disclosed inventions, is 12 months and thus twice as long as the grace period under the EPC and JPA. The scope of inventions removed from the state of art is much broader than that of the EPC. Section 102(b) removes two classes of disclosed inventions from the state of art. The first class includes inventions which are disclosed by an inventor, joint inventor, or a third party who obtained the invention directly or indirectly from the inventor. Removing this class of disclosures is familiar within the first-to-file world because these disclosures are also excluded from the state of art under Article 9 of the Draft Substantive Patent Law Treaty (World Intellectual Property Organization, Draft of Substantive Patent Law Treaty, Article 9 (here).
Here's my theory: The editors calling the shots at the big US publishing houses are all in the pay of the US television industry. TV tried to kill the printed word for decades, with a great deal of success, but there was always a diehard core of readers who refused to be defeated. Finally the TV execs have come up with a plan--if the industry refuses to die, it must be induced to commit suicide.

Jesus took the Twelve and spent everyday with them, teaching the Word, explaining the Word, and living the Word before them. This is what I believe overcame John’s heart as he began his accounting of the Gospel of Christ: “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen His glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth… No one has ever seen God; the only God, who is at the Father’s side, He has made Him known.”(John 1:14&18) John, overcome in his spirit, as he recalls the Word becoming flesh and dwelling among them, is a beautiful picture of discipleship. There is way more to discipleship than just teaching a book, a “discipleship” plan, etc… it is about dwelling with one another, sewing together the bonds which will birth great joy, and sooner or later, will bring great sorrow. Jesus had Judas Iscariot, known from the beginning as the one set to betray, yet Jesus never yielded His discipling of this fallen man.

Now, when you first end a day in Pathologic a message comes up on screen. It tells you, in simple, silent text, how many have died in the village and how many are infected. It also says that there are eleven days left, and it’s not lying. When you open your journal you can clearly see twelve tabs, one for each day. The game ceaselessly reminds you of its own span.

I looked at the clock again. It was 5.45 am, but that was fine. Breakfast would be served until 11. I could sleep for another four hours. But then I heard drums, announcements made through a tannoy, cars honking. I had fallen back asleep and in the haze of coming around what I first thought of were the stories of the Khmer Rouge marching into Phnom Penh back in the Seventies at the beginning of Pol Pot's terrible reign. It had started with early morning drumming, tannoy announcements, marching. I looked at the clock. It was 7.30. My God -- my first day in Cambodia and I was waking to a new revolution. Could it be?

He is not exercising his ministry.

The Maryland bill also bars employers from firing, disciplining or otherwise penalizing an employee, or failing or refusing to hire an applicant, who refuses to disclose such information. Although the law appears to be relatively broad in scope, critics have noted that it would not prevent employers from “shoulder surfing” to see what employees or applicants have posted online, or from requiring employees to “friend” them on social media sites.

Dear Miss Despert Hart,
Let this idea in and feel the terror of the awful realization of alien immediacy-- its presence beyond real or illusion; its presence in all aspects of our lives--our past, present, future. Letting this in brings a boon, enlightenment, the understanding that everything is connected to everything else on every level--so you can visit the other side of your hand on Mars in 1937 and find your watch inside a Chinese box found on the bottom of the ocean unopened since the Ming Dynasty, and find your grandfather alive in the microscopic villages along the ear hair your grandson. And the sun is just a reflection of your iris. And without looking out of your door you can know all things on earth and even if you never look farther than your own backyard maybe one day you'll notice that the very farthest reaches of outer space are right at your fingertips and the vacation you will take this summer is being remembered right now in the bathroom you just walked out of three months ago. And the cares of tomorrow / must wait / til this day is done.

A 2011 post-holiday shopping study by Google and Ipsos OTX also depicts consumers using their smartphones at many different points in the purchase path. For instance, 46% of smartphone users who used their mobile device for holiday shopping said they researched an item on their smartphone then went to a store to make their purchase. And 37% said they researched an item on their smartphone then made their purchase online on a computer. Holiday shopping data indicates that no matter the purchase channel, mobile devices are likely to play a role in a mobile user’s purchase process.

My third thesis brings me around to one of John’s titles: “the Apostle of Love.” There is nothing so guaranteed to produce lengthy outbursts of praise, complete with lots of repetition, as love. John, possessed of childlike vitality and sagacious patience, was possessed by love. “See what kind of love the Father has given to us,” he says in one place, in astonishment; and “we love because he first loved us.”[5] He is love’s contemplative, and he cannot help but turn over and over in his mind the glory, the steadfast love, and the faithfulness of God, as it was perfected in his dear friend Jesus of Nazareth.

From runways to Forever 21, these colors are sure to catch your eye, and with the right styling and pieces, this can be a great trend for everyone this Spring and Summer! Whether it's on a bathing suit, accents on a wedge, or a full on dress, will you be rocking this trend?

Icy braclets enclosed first his ankles, then his knees. The cold struck his groin with a shock but he kept going. Soon he was up to his neck and gasping for breath. Within moments he became aware of the fact that the water felt quite warm. He began to swim. The indistinct, twinkling barrier filled his eyes. It was as if he had morphed into a different creature entirely, one that could fly through the thick atmosphere of the reservoir, pushing the medium aside with its limbs. He quickly became aware of a feeling of deep water beneath him. He felt like a character he thought he'd seen in a Chagal painting, flying over fields, churches, villages, like an angel.

The fangtooth or ‘ogre fish’ is one of the many weird deep sea creatures. I remember being fascinated by them when I was younger. So freaking scary! Probably after one of those puppies appeared in a cartoon version or something. I remember also seeing an angler fish in one of the Disney’s I believe. The little light was the thing that was most scary oddly enough.
If, therefore, God desires every knee to bow to Jesus and every tongue to confess Him, so should we. We should be ‘jealous’ (as Scripture sometimes puts it) for the honor of His name—troubled when it remains unknown, hurt when it is ignored, indignant when it is blasphemed, and all the time anxious and determined that it shall be given the honor and glory which are due to it. The highest of all missionary motives is neither obedience to the Great Commission (important as that is), nor love for sinners who are alienated and perishing (strong as that incentive is, especially when we contemplate the wrath of God, verse 18), but rather zeal—burning and passionate zeal—for the glory of Jesus Christ.

There are three kinds of dogs: ornamental, alarm, and security. Ornamental dogs are fashion accessories for overnight-sensation-media-attention-seeking-starlet-poptarts and for those who choose to emulate them. You know what I mean. These dogs are kept in purses. They are dolled up. They even dress similarly to their owners. Nails painted the same color, and such. These poor things forget they are dogs because they are never allow to experience the fullness of doghood. When the poptart tires of the dog or the dog misbehaves enough (as in, I’m tired of this crap…leave me alone), then the dog is no longer cute. The poor thing gets replaced with a newer or different model as quickly as the poptart can change lipstick. I always feel for these dogs. They deserve much better than they get. Hopefully, once they are out of the spotlight, they get adopted by a much better family who will treat with the respect a dog deserves.

Life is so bizarre sometimes! We purchased a thickness planer for Jim’s shop through eBay two weeks ago. The seller was in a town close to us, so we contacted them and asked if we could pick the planer up at their warehouse. After multiple contacts, they finally responded and said yes we could pick it up there and they would refund the shipping amount. We picked it up; it works fine. However, they refunded the entire amount to us – the cost of the item plus the shipping amount. I emailed them and told them – they responded with a nice note saying they appreciated our honesty and that usually when this occurs, they never hear from the buyer and lose their money. Hmmmm…sounds like this has happened before.

My husband was going to fast with me, but changed his mind and asked when I would end mine as he would like to continue my fast. This is something different. I am wondering how it will go as I was planning to fast at least a week to ten days, depending on the weight loss which is one purpose of my regular January fast. As to the spiritual part, I had some things to discuss with my Lord. Actually, I always do, so no fast goes without the spiritual aspect.

4, 300 foot rows all trenched by hand.This year we were very fortunate and lucky to have our friend Jim Johansen (of Wesley acres produce) let us borrow his awesome antique potato planter. I was so happy when he offered it to us to use. With what took 3 days to do last year only took a mere 1 1/2 hour to do this year!! I could not believe it! I must have one. This thing trenched,buried,and Hilled the rows. And of course my mom and nephew wanted to try it. My nephew was actually better at it than the rest of us.
I haul ass back onto the highway. I take an exit that I thought would take me directly to the first accident scene. Well this doesn’t. It takes me to a service road that will put me on the highway just after the accident. I could have took that but decided to drive over the grass median. I slowly jump the curb and Splash!!! I was in what felt like 2 feet of water / mud. I lightly hit the accelerator because I know if I stop I’ll be stuck. I can hear the mud just flying all over my car. I was able to get out of the mud and start toward the scene. I get back the scene and I’m praying that there are no fatalities.

A guy arrives at a backyard party, waves to no one in particular, and meekly says “hi everybody.” Nobody even notices. “TOO LIGHT,” proclaims the ad. Then the same guy is shown crashing through the back fence in a fire-spewing monster truck. “TOO HEAVY,” for sure. In contrast, we’re told, the beer that’s right for you is “not too heavy, not too light.”

Is it any wonder that we don't hear much about these things? None of this means that we shouldn't hear about Nazi brutality and evil, nor does it mean that contemporary Jews bear guilt for the deeds of some of their fellows. (But strangely the zeal for hunting down Nazi war criminals was never matched by one hunting down Communist mass murderers.) However, it puts a crimp in the Jewish notion that they have been unique victims, and in the notion that Germans have been uniquely evil.

And then once recovered, what do you do next? Training for these babies is full on and gives you a real focus. Running 4+ days a week and doing more and more miles and seeing improvements along the way, really gives you a boost and focuses the mind. So when it’s all over, there’s a gap – at least for a bit. For a lot of people if you don’t enter races that often, what now? Enter another race. This year is London’s year and there are lots of great running events on. One I’d only just heard about is the British 10k London on Sunday 8th July – a week or so before the London Olympics and covering part of the planned Olympic Marathon route. Covers a lot of the great sights you see on the London Marathon and the Royal Parks Foundation 1/2 and “only” 6.25 miles (10km) and 25,000 people – so a great crowd running through normally busy roads in central London. See the route plan below:

I got to Norman Regional Healthplex this morning at 6:27 and was given a buzzer at registration so they could call me back, because they didn't open for another 3 minutes. They called me back, verified my information, put a bracelet on me and I waited. I got called back again shortly after and was taken back to a room and given the fizz-less orange drink. She told me I had 5 minutes to drink it...I was thirsty and I didn't have time to mess around, so it was gone in less than a minute...and it really wasn't that bad. I told Adam it tasted like a stronger version of the Hi-C Orange at McDonalds that had been mixed right. He understood that analogy...lol

The opposite of freedom is constraint. To “constrain” is to imprison, force or severely restrict. Constraint is a consequence of sin. Just as shame limits our ability to see one another in innocence, constraint limits our ability to make a free gift of ourselves. This constraint is manifested in many ways, and we feel it in the form of uncontrolled passions. Especially, the urge to misuse each other is toxic to freedom. This results in a lack of freedom to give oneself. Without the ability to give of ourselves, we lose the ability to know who we are. By inhibiting our freedom to give of ourselves, the constraints of sin—uncontrolled passions—touch precisely on our ability to be known and find ourselves. We must learn self-control in order for us to achieve freedom.
So I was talking to a friend earlier today who will remain nameless, and she has a dilemma she needed help with. Let’s call her Lucy, like Ace and TJ do. So Lucy is a recent UNC Charlotte graduate (I freaking miss having classes with her). She applied to several graduate schools and has been accepted to all of them, except for the one she hasn’t heard from – University of Massachusetts. After deliberation she has narrowed it does to three schools. Two are in the U.S. and one is in England.
But inspiring anorexia is not the only worry--overweight and obesity can arise from eating disorders, too. There's a note made of eating disorders in the Report from the White House Task Force on Childhood Obesity, and one lone eating disorder specialist was at the first-ever White House Childhood Obesity Summit in April. But eating disorders in general are outside the rubric of the campaign. The focus on NOT talking about weight, however, now seems to have become a regular part of Mrs. Obama's rhetoric.

Here’s the thing to the negative people of the world, it’s time to just smile. This life is too short to continue to be down and talk about how horrible this and that is. Bad things happen, we get it, but you don’t need to continue to share to a world who doesn’t want to listen. Now, I am not saying hold it all inside, talk out issues with close friends and loved ones as they are near (Not on Facebook or Twitter).
"How can we fight against them unless we see them, or overcome them unless we face them? Our victory does not consist in being unconscious of them but in not consenting to them, and not to consent to them is to be displeased with them." (Introduction to the Devout Life)As we begin this novena let us follow the direction of the beloved St. Francis de Sales by calling to mind our sins and expressing true contrition to God. Let us consider our work and business dealings, our duties and responsibilities and discover where sin has tainted them. Let us lift up our voices in asking the Holy Spirit to help us conquer these sins through grace and devotion. Most especially, let us realize that our vocation in life is lifted up by humility, prayer and devotion, sanctifying our own lives and the lives of those we come in contact with.

There was no warning beyond the scream from the Force to duck. A golden blade burned the ozone where his head had just been before Ken had even registered movement. Not having time for anything fancy, the Jedi Counselor threw himself into a forward roll and, rising to his feet, light the back end of his weapon and snapped it at the Sith’s lower back. But the Sith’s second golden blade was there to meet his attack and bat it away even as the dark warrior spun, bringing his right leg up and thrusting a boot into Ken’s gut hard enough to lift him off his feet.

So, what I have to do, and it’s tragic however you look at it, is fire at one of those houses. The first place that they fire at me from, even though there are children on the roof, I will immediately fire on it, and some of those children will be killed – because I have no choice, because I have no other means to protect myself. The terrorists took away from me the normal means of self-defense. It’s out of the question that I not protect myself, so I hope the terrorists will take the children off the roofs, and I will wait for them to take the children off the roofs in order to defend myself against the terrorists, but if they don’t take the children off the roofs, I will continue. I have no choice. A state cannot say “I will allow my citizens to be killed because the enemy has placed children on all the roofs and I will not kill children.”
Sexual corruption in the social care system unquestionably exists. I spent five grubby and frustrating months delving into it, and that in turn led to helping in a tiny way to unearth the cover-up at Stafford Hospital, plus the scandal of psychotherapists’ fees paid by bent social workers to get small people into their clutches. There are major centres of it in Plymouth, Liverpool and Bristol, and it is driven by the obsessive compulsion of a few senior people. In one or two cases, it is linked to an adoption racket. In one specific instance, there was clear evidence of police involvement in it.

On 26th November, six days after Emily had emailed with the latest information, I received an email from her father saying that Emily had been taken ill and was in intensive care. In spite of the appalling anxiety he and his family were dealing with, he was kind enough to stay in touch with regular updates. We allowed ourselves to be cautiously optimistic when he told us she had regained consciousness and was making slow but encouraging progress.

After letting the candles burn for about an hour, the only slight heat we noticed was around the jar mouth just underneath the wood, but it's not nearly enough to cause any problems. In general, the heat seems to head straight out the jar openings, so we think it's plenty safe as long as the candles are monitored. Also, it might come in handy that I just learned (from Pinterest, of course) that I can either freeze or bake my Mason jars to remove old wax.

The term “banality of evil” was coined in attempt to describe the actions of the Nazis, and of the everyday citizens who performed unspeakable atrocities in the name of their country. Since then, this phrase has been used to describe the more mundane processes of serial killers and psychopaths, who adopt ideologies of “evil” as a normal, everyday lifestyle. The Dutch film “The Vanishing” stakes this concept literally as we follow the dull, boring life of mild-mannered Raymond Lermorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a middle class high school chemistry teacher who plays with his kids, takes his family on vacations to their summer home, and clinically tests the effects of chloroform to more effectively kidnap his victims.

My first day in "the field"-- my first day working in a hospital with another nurse/preceptor, I worked with Molly. She's literally about half my age-- 25 or 26. If you didn't know her, you'd think she was a sorority girl. But when you get to know her, she's anything but a sorority girl. She's smart and got a wicked sense of humor. When I'm working in the same hospital, she always checks up on me, and she's someone I can always call for advice and information.

Foster had never visited the river when he wrote the song. He had even misspelled the name of the river “Swanee”.

You have to release most of them immediately. They're carnivores, and if they're hungry they eat each other.

I'll say, we were all warming up to the little guys though.
This marvelous hotel is located in the city of Chandler and the brainchild of Dr. Alexander Chandler who founded the city in 1912. He named the hotel after Friar Marcos de Niza, a priest sent north to Mexico City in search of wealthy cities.

Before she donned her hair-shirt in self-recrimination, she informed him that she was going to tell her sister about what had happened. Of course he begged her not to, but she was determined to at least get that much off of her conscience. After she had finished packing and made herself a light meal, she sat down in the living room to wait for the family’s arrival. Earlier, Evie had phoned Waverley and let him know they would be home in a couple of hours, so the time was very near…in about twenty minutes or so. He stayed locked way in the room he shared with Evie.

The economy of the United States is based on the free flow of resources, energy, and the rights of consumers to buy and sell as they see fit. Any interference in this economic process quickly leads to shortages, rising prices, and civil unrest. The purpose of President Obama signing this new Executive Order is yet unclear, however, it may coincide with information coming out of Israel yesterday that plans for a tactical or strategic strike on Iran are accelerating. Oil prices in Europe rose over $3 a barrel for Brent crude after the Israeli actions, and US oil prices rose $2 for WTI.

Gratitude practice means facing reality and gaining awareness of the many aspects of yourself: your inner self, your one self, your subpersonalities, and those of the people around you. It means understanding and embracing your shadow. It means letting go of a need to control yourself and others, it means growing compassion for those who have hurt you, it means being aware of the difficult parts of your life and still being able to reach into your pocket on a dark, snowy night just before you leap from a bridge to find that small, innocent petal. Gratitude is the ultimate expression of hope.

There was a little blond haired, green eyed, american-born girl who due to some strange twist of fate was born with an intense connection to the Latino culture. Her name was Tiffany Joy. She loved to speak spanish, dance salsa and play bossa nova on her guitar. One day, no longer able to deny the "call to the south" she left her family and friends behind and moved to Buenos Aires where she miraculously fell in love with a beautiful Colombian boy named Dani. He invited her to travel to his country where she was warmly embraced by his family and friends. Two of those friends being a lovely couple, who had just decided to join their lives together by marrying, there names are Alejandro and Clara.
I’ve missed a lot of soccer practice this season taking Bugaboo to find the potty, which is inside the school building, about 200 yards from the soccer field. At roughly yard 199, Bugaboo informed me that she did not actually need to use said potty, but had merely wanted to go for a walk with me, and that she was tired of everyone playing attention to Beanie, Mr. Man, and Baby Guy.

I love Bournemouth beach, whether the sun is shining or it’s pouring with rain. It’s just a fantastic place to be, and to photograph. There’s something about it. I think maybe the tide and the waves hypnotise you and pull you back to them time and time again. They certainly seem to be having that affect on me. This isn’t part of my ‘One-a-Day’ photo blog, that ended yesterday but I couldn’t resist posting another photo to start the month of May off.
The Dani are equally short on cuisine. The staple is the sweet potato, and the pot bellies on the naked children running wild in the villages betray a lack of protein. “Pot bellies mean peace,” the guide jokes, hinting that the only time the Dani enjoy meat with their one veg is after a ruck with the neighbours.

Brandom’s account of deontic scorekeeping, which I endorse, requires a form of strong permission. What it is to be entitled to a theoretical or practical commitment must be independent of what it is to be committed to it in order for his account of the various inferential relations (permissive, committive, and incompatibility) that constitute conceptual content to get off the ground. This means that I can’t hold that obligation and permission are straightforwardly interdefinable, and thereby makes it harder for me to uphold the unity of the deontic proposed above. I don’t have a complete solution to this problem, but I have a rough strategy. Although I don’t think that all forms of permission can be simply reduced to a corresponding notion of obligation, I do think that what distinguishes such strong forms of permission can be explained in terms of the ways in which they function as reasons for action. If I can then explain the general structure of this kind of reasoning in terms of the fundamental obligations that underlie it, I will have indirectly explained permission in terms of obligation. This strategy would not only shore up the unity just mentioned, but would also secure the primacy of the notion of obligation discussed above. However, this isn’t so well worked out, so I won’t discuss it further.

Today we were accepted into the Mountain View Art and Wine Festival and the Los Altos Art and Wine Festival, and we're waiting to hear on three others. Additionally, Mackie has scheduled the Holiday Food and Gift Festival in Tacoma to display her pottery. We're both really excited about the future and looking forward to seeing you at our upcoming shows!
Geoffrey Lewis was solid, but I didn't feel he was all that different from what I have seen him in in the past. Which isn't a bad thing... just an observation really. The man has been in tons of stuff that I know I have seen and cannot think of any of it off hand. He was in Thunderbolt and Lightfoot which I really need to sit down and watch one of these days.
as well as English?
Season to taste (this means add salt and pepper – in this case black pepper). The gazpacho will keep for a day or so, allowing you to prepare it the day before. Pour into a suitable bowl. I like to use a glass bowl to best display the rich colours. Garnish with coriander and shavings of parmesan and serve cold with chunky bread.
Ah. Spring.
Afterwards, we mostly relaxed. Abdu came over to my house and we watched Twelve Monkeys. It was an interesting movie and I think Abdu was a little confused at times, and so was I. By the end I more or less had a sense of what happened and did my best to explain it to him. It takes place entirely in America and so I did my best to explain the social cues and context of phrases, sentences and the meanings of certain things that he probably wouldn’t understand not being from America and not seeing a ton of American films. I think he got most of it. Afterwards, Bethany, Tim, Abdu, Dayyibu and I played Monopoly. Dayyibu and Abdu had a little bit of trouble at first since they had never played but I think the next time we play they’ll do much better.
There were some pretty great costumes as well. But both my daughter and I left saying, what was up with that blue dress and the bright orange bow that Snow wore in the closing scene. ???
How long he would have gone on I don't know, but at this juncture the train luckily stopped, and I heard the welcome shout of 'Pedding-ton, Pedding-ton,' which announced our arrival at the West End terminus.

In books that discuss cotton spinning, we're told that one end of cotton sliver will spin more smoothly than the other due to the direction of carding. So if your cotton is not spinning smoothly, flip the cotton sliver over to see if it spins more smoothly from the other end.
Many seriously harmful consequences from legalizing euthanasia could far outweigh any benefits it might have. Apart from its harmful impact on the societal value of respect for life, it would harm the institutions of law and medicine. Can we even imagine teaching medical students how to kill their patients?
The funny part is when we start defending our labels. We get mad, especially if someone does not agree with our point of view… Don’t they know how right we are??!!
In short, its a good book and its approach to the reader is a lot more easy going than a lot of the old CAMRA publications (sorry Protzy, I did nod off a bit during those last couple of books). Basically I can see any beer curious individual taking a lot from this very easily and as an insight to the current world of craft beer, there isn't really anything that's missed out.
.:: SYR6: Koncertas Stan Brakhage Prisiminimui is an EP by Sonic Youth. The sixth in a series of experimental releases put out on the band's own SYR label, the album is a live recording from an April 13, 2003 benefit show for the Anthology Film Archives. The band, joined by percussionist Tim Barnes, played along with silent Stan Brakhage films.
Don't know where that came from. I'm stuck in some kind of Martian imagery this week, and I imagined each blade of grass as a root-bound Martian, frozen by our strange weather (after all, it is red hot on their home planet), unable to move as paws and boots came down upon them.
In this instance, Stoke were hardly solely to blame. Aston Villa haven’t improved any since that soporific goalless draw at the Brit on Boxing Day, and this at times, resembled trench warfare more than a football match, a stalemate with plenty of ineffective aerial bombardment from both sides and the usual wrestling and push me-pull you nonsense at set plays.
Paisley baby, paisley thumb,
First person is a great way to tell a story. It offers an immediacy and an intimacy that is incredibly hard to capture in other forms of writing. But it does have some disadvantages and they should definitely be considered before you charge into the fray. I’m not saying don’t do it (Mostly because I adore first person) but if you do be aware of the choices that you’re making and do it well.

Oneness does not understand this. It doesn’t know what “needing” anything means. Aboriginals, who remain in unity-consciousness, and other indigenous people, do not know what “need” means; whatever they need just appears because they are in harmony with nature. If we really knew, we could just think the thought “warm” and it would be so. We have the capability to change anything in the reality from within. But many of us feel that we are just people, with no power and no say regarding how things are in creation.

It has been quite some time since I last cook Dalcha Curry. Dalcha curry goes along well with all types of roti (bread). This is a mildly spiced curry; therefore kids would normally take it. To speed up preparation time, I soaked the dhall beans for around 4 hours before cooking it. If you want to soak the beans overnight, then you better leave them in the fridge to prevent the beans from turning bad.
A couple of weeks ago, we attempted to go on a Cub Scout "hike". Unfortunately, we had the wrong day so, nobody was there except for our neighbors that strangely enough made the same mistake that we did. Since it was a nice afternoon, we decided to do our own hike with our 4 boys, and our neighbor's 2 boys.
...but, with modifications, the look of the monster itself, as you can see by comparing the frame from the movie above with this illustration from the magazine. In the movie the beast is identified as a "rhedosaurus", a species that does not exist in the annals of paleontology. It's fun to believe that the first two letters of the beast's name stand for the "RH" of Ray Harryhausen (Harryhausen denies it, but I think perhaps he doth protest too much).

What makes this important in David, is that Gabriele is posing for such a work of art. Which brings up all sorts of questions about how you know, before it has acquired any reputation, whether a work is likely to endure or not. Of course you can’t know what external forces – fire, flood, war – might destroy it but does the artist or the model know when they are part of something as great as the David or Leonardo’s portrait?

First up was a camping trip with Paul. We headed up to Boyne City, Michigan, stayed at a very expensive state park, and road some terrific hilly roads around the area. To be camping again was great, even if it wasn’t my usual accommodations. Paul brought along a spacious 9x9 tent and two vintage cots. Luxury!! It felt great to have time off again, the racing team has me working a lot of hours and a lot of days. Too soon though, we had to head back. Paul hasn’t achieved retirement yet and the j.o.b. was calling him. Retirement will come soon, we hope. Plans have been made....
At the United Nations, the South African delegation protects its tyrannical allies (such as Mugabe and the military junta in Burma) by protesting against outside interference with governments that abuse human rights. The current South African delegation’s arguments are nearly identical to the arguments that the apartheid regime once used when it insisted that foreigners should remain silent about oppression in South Africa.
Though we are limited in what we can share because of copyrights, I wanted to share one little nugget with you all:
The Government PR machine in in full defensive mode. It is, perhaps, not the best idea, when trying to convince people that you have behaved with utter scrupulousness, to make a statement which contains a big whopper. And Jeremy Hunt did just that. Unfortunately, none of the media seem to be challenging this line and it is increasingly repeated by every hapless MP wheeled out to defend the beleaguered Secretary of State.
Despite the fact that I semi-shut up my hearing, I could soak up your feelings.
Daniel begins to feel just as lonely as he discovers Sarah has applied to college and will leave home soon. Concerned with the thought of losing both Sarah and Briony, Daniel busies himself helping his neighbor Shoup overcome the prejudice of the townspeople who refuse to do business with an African-American merchant. Before long, business is booming and Daniel is too busy to notice that Sarah has made a trip to the West Coast to smooth things over with Briony. When Daniel returns home from work, he questions an extra place setting at the table. Daniel soon learns a very special friend has returned to Canaan.

If you like to get your blood pressure up and have little value for your precious time, spend a few hours looking at the Primary/Secondary Education and Curriculum Standards for your state or province. The vast majority of these standards are developed around the concept that a liberal arts education - as opposed to a more focused "skills training" type of education - is the best choice to ensure that students are able to think critically and expansively and to solve problems. There are actually some pretty good arguments to be made in favor of a liberal arts education. Personally, I am not a big fan of any approach that dictates that there is a specific body of knowledge that you need to have in order to succeed in the world; there are simply too many examples of healthy, happy, productive people who know so many disparate things - and don't know so many others - to categorize "good" and "bad" education so simplistically. I also don't subscribe to a pedantic ("I teach you") school of thought when it comes to education, because I believe that people learn best when they enjoy what they are learning and are able to apply those learnings to some practical use.

A swift kick to the stomach brings me back to the present. My body curls over in pain as I scream, “Jack please, p-please Hun; enough for tonight. I won’t leave you, w-we can talk about this in the morning.” I manage to get all of this out before the next kick to the ribs is received. Crack. He hears it, I know he hears it but that doesn’t stop him or slow him. I feel it, my rib snapping, and my eyes widening in pain. Too much, I think. I don’t know if I can handle much more of this, the darkness closing in on my eyes.
Hummmm....I just wonder to myself,how many will graduate from this school with an uncontrollable urge to become wee little toy makers.

I live in a boring part of California to match. It’s so boring that when I leave it, for LA or whatnot, I revert to a wide-eyed hick: “There are so many people! So many hills! It’s so bright at night! S0 noisy! The buses bend! The buildings are so tall! Omigod, I’m in the city!” I get all excited and then I go back home. I live in California, but I don’t consider myself to. It’s not the beach nor the city nor even a Redwood forest, and I can’t see the lights of Sea World from my house I like I used to be able to in my childhood home. This is the desert, and an area equivalent to a washed up beldame. My city is faded and forgotten; a hasbeen, the Slimcea Girl. It’s Norma Desmond… or so I thought.

"For thousands of years, Mayans were expert practitioners of bee husbandry, and honey was an essential forest resourceâ€¦as a sweetener, as an antibiotic and as an ingredient in the Mayan version of mead. The Mayans, like other tropical forest cultures, worked with large-bodied meliponine bees that produce a variety of honeys. Their favorite, and one of the most productive species, has been Melipona beecheii, 'Xunan kab', which means, literally, 'royal lady'."

Just five hours earlier, I was delivering food to a new client on my Meals on Wheels route when the tears surprised me. Mr. Blevens wore slacks and an ironed work shirt with a patch with his first name on it, and as I walked up his front steps, he looked as if he wasn't sure what to do with his hands. I introduced myself and as I gave him his meal, he looked at it and said, "God bless you, ma'am. Thank you. It sure is a good thing y'all do."
“During the first week, we couldn’t even find the camera because we were so nervous. Even while performing, we did a lot of big and small mistakes but I think we got a bit more relaxed now. It’s a relief that we got to show the image we worked hard to get ready.”(Suho)

As with most writers, there is a reason for my absence - one of those reasons flared up yesterday. A root canal that was installed in December 2010 failed Saturday night - split this premolar into two pieces. The long and short is yesterday, when my regular dentist was unable to fully extract the tooth and I ended up driving 1.5 hours south to Roanoke to have it removed (drilled out to be exact), and then drove that same distance home.

Everyday she trusts unconditionally in all of us. I really don't know why. Some days I don't even trust myself. But I have never doubted God's hand in her life. She was intricately made and specifically chosen for her place in time. She is my teacher. Some how she knows that we will keep her safe. She reaches her hands into a constant oblivion. She steps into open space. She swims beneath the water's surface always knowing that we, you and I, will be there to pull her up. How she does it I do not know. What faith I though I had was only a false security in my mind. I want what she has. Peace. I want to know that there is someone there to protect and rescue me, even if I can't see them.
The guy that traded the chess set was getting long in the tooth and needed a knife to scrape his trail bars so he could eat them. He said he’d swiped the chess set from a homeless guy that’d passed out from too much wine in the parking lot down by an ALCO store in a small town in Western Kansas. I’d been carrying that thing around a long time.

When your voices are heard about the injustices taking place in America on the backs of the middle class due to excessive greed in Capitalism and its refusal to use their profits to better us all so we can better ourselves, then they will continue with an overbalanced and unjust system that weighs heavily on the backs of the middle class while taking welfare and subsidies that only make the wealthy richer. Not many of us can claim to make 20 million a year while unemployed unless we earned it on the backs of others, won a lottery, or inherited the same. It is time for a more equitable tax system where everyone pays to variable degrees of ability into the Treasury, so that America can still defend itself and it’s future without becoming reliant on others who would defeat us all.
The acting was stellar on all accounts. The biggest standout was Joan Allen who portrayed her sadness and aggravation with a realistic flair. It was also interesting to see Tobey Maguire, Christina Ricci, Katie Holmes and Elijah Wood as young actors. They definitely showcase their talents, especially Tobey Maguire, with his surprisingly large bong hit.
Since all things are empty, the world is, at a very profound level, what you believe it to be. Wherever you imagine a Buddha, a Buddha definitely goes. Wherever a Buddha goes, they accomplish their function. A Buddha has the power to fulfill all pure wishes. Conditions are neither perfect nor imperfect, they are as perfect as the way we view them.
On April 22, 2012, the national Egyptian gas companies, EGAS and EGPC, announced the revocation of the agreement to supply natural gas to Israel. The announcement was relayed via the Egyptian company EMG, which has acted as the liaison between the Egyptian national gas companies and Israeli gas consumers, chief among them the Israel Electric Company (IEC). In 2010, Egypt supplied IEC with 37 percent of its gas consumption; in 2011, that dropped to 18 percent because of attacks on the pipeline in the northern

Yes there is better awareness today, earlier detection methods… new drugs, new tests, new treatments. Breast cancer is fast becoming considered almost a manageable disease by some standards, tho not by mine, not by a long shot. Instead I find myself wondering more and more…what about prevention? I mean, if I were you reading this blog that is what I would want to know more about. Is there anything I can do to try and prevent getting this awful disease in the first place?

I think there is a lot to be said for finding one specific thing to fight and taking that on, whether it be trying to find homes for the thousands of young orphans, providing clean water, or trying to end oppresive regimes. However, there is also a need for big-picture campaigns like ONE to keep the larger picture before our eyes at all times.
Our politicians pretend that we and Islam have shared goals. Margaret Beckett, when British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, told Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on the 7July 2006: “Our obligation to the values that mean most to us — freedom, tolerance and justice — has grown even stronger and deeper since the London bombs. So has our relationship with the Islamic world, which also shares our common ideals, today.”
“Yeah, I can see that you’re wearing a belt now.”
Yes. See Romans 15:16 in the original Greek, or in the RSV and NIV. The ministry of the gospel is thus a priestly work, according to St Paul. And the name of “elder” (=presbyter) given to Christian pastors is also given to a group of priestly offerers of incense in Heaven in Revelation 5:8 (cp. Luke 1:8-9).
A few days back I was asked an interesting question. Although personal but I believe that the answer to the question is worth sharing. Somebody asked,
On New Years Day 2012, I opened up my new Vax vacuum cleaner for a spot of spring cleaning, and wow, what a little beauty SHE is. I can even hoover with a broken wrist. She effortlessly glides across the carpet sucking up every tiny little speck - including the ones that have been there for many years. I was so excited about her capabilities I spent much of the day vacuuming. The whooshing sound it makes going across the carpet was enough to make my head spin. Tom wasn't happy about me using it on the car though.
Part of that research may include some travel. I’ve connected with a mentoring couple within Wycliffe who have worked for years in South America.

The other night in my deepest slumber, I must have been dreaming about our wonderful rhino who are in desperate need of intervention by us from the incensed poachers and users of rhino horn. Seen we had just celebrated World Rhino Day, I thought it might have been the reason that these shy, prehistoric looking beasts were playing on my mind. I made a concious effort to hold onto my vision so that I could portray the idea on paper the next morning.

What’s the year’s biggest hit so far? Nanban. What’s the next biggest? Last week’s Oru Kal Oru Kannadi (going by the tremendous response from the trade and the audiences). And the next? Kadhalil Sodhappuvadhu Yeppadi (KSY). Agreed, we have quite some way to go before 2012 ends (and the world too, if you believe conspiracy theorists), but going by the current trend, it looks comedy will be the flavour of the year and comedy films will figure prominently among the top grossers as well.

The first step in any project is to analyze the space and it’s users. The look of the space is always a product of it’s function, not the other way around. Choosing lighting, materials and finishes that compliment the bones of the design enhance the users experience in that space.

The presentation is solid and spectacular so far. Slant Six’s programming expertise with a couple of excellent SOCOM titles on the PSP as well as the hard-core fan-favorite SOCOM Confrontation on the PS3 is on full display here in a sharper-looking game that’s going to make a lot of folks happy from new players to RE veterans. My suggestion to the cross-armed, stubborn RE die-hards that think this game isn’t the same thing as what they love is to shake it off and realizes, that YES, it may be an all-new way to play a RE game for some of you guys and gals, but it WORKS and works brilliantly once you see how well everything comes together. Besides, Capcom hasn’t let that old-school gameplay you crave die off completely. Resident Evil Revelations on the Nintendo 3DS will offer up an excellent game that plays like the older titles (but looks absolutely incredible on the handheld).

Other films like It's a Wonderful Life had dealt with the darker side of the American dream, but Arsenic and Old Lace is black comedy of the highest order, with gallows humor to spare. It is the story of homicidal old ladies, a houseful of lunatics and a scarred, fugitive ex-con. And yet it never fails to be light, funny and just plain fun.

But it appears as if she was not only lying to a judge but abusing the powers of her office either (1) to dig for material to help save her law license in any ethics proceedings against her; or (2) as part of her futile attempt to compile “evidence” substantiating her wild claims of an anti-Cline “conspiracy” between Judge Hudson, defense attorneys, and the N&O.
Wow! As I look at this topic I am amazed how scripture lights this up for me. I hope you understand where I come from. I am nothing. Christ is everything. Yes, I know who I am in Christ. I rejoice in that. But personally I have not found myself living 100% in the power and strength of God. Until my flesh is completely crucified and no longer affects my life and my thoughts, I will not be satisfied.
Dishonorable Mention: Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close – Okay, this film had enough redeeming attributes that I can’t rightfully call it one of the worst films of the year but god damn did it make me angry. Firstly, it all hinged on the performance of a kid who doesn’t really seem to have a clue as to what “acting” entails. The most maddening thing, earning it’s unranked spot on this list is that it uses 9/11 as a cheap gimmick to wring some unearned tears out of the audience. 9/11 has a place in cinema. United 93 proved that. This is not that fucking place. The fact that this got an Oscar nomination sends the mind reeling. Like I said, not necessarily one of the worst movies of the year (though the more I talk about it, the more I reconsider that) but the dislike I bear this movie earns it a spot on here.

College Guy – College Guy showed me lots of attention, told me he loved me, about everything a girl could want. But, he partied too much for my liking, and part of me just never really felt for him the way he felt about me (although I really wanted to). We did have lots of fun talking via AOL IM while he was away at school, and I was able to visit him a few times, which was a blast. The parties I attended with College Guy were actually some of the only college parties I’ve ever attended (my own college experience was pretty lackluster), and it definitely felt cool to be included, considering I was much younger than the crowd. But at the end of the day, I liked him better far away – on the phone, IMing online, but when he was with me, I sort of lost all interest.
The words on the badge reminded me of a recent article by one of the professors at my alma mater. Fanfare for the Comma was in the New York Times’ Opinionator column on April 09. The author, Ben Yagoda, who is professor of English at the University of Delaware, wrote about the rules of punctuation: specifically the comma. He laments that his students read less “edited prose.” Their writing is influenced by the informality and shorthand used in social networks. These new ways of communication coupled with less attention to the rules of grammar create a loss of skills in “punctuation and spelling.”

Frustrated that her previous efforts to get more women into the top echelons of European business have not yielded stronger results, Viviane Reding, the senior justice official in the European Union, was to announce a new effort Monday that could result in legislation requiring that women occupy up to 60 percent of the seats on corporate boards. …E.U.-wide rules were now needed, she said. “Personally, I don’t like quotas,” Ms. Reding said. “But I like what the quotas do. Quotas open the way to equality and they break through the glass ceiling.” Countries that have quotas “bring the results,” she said. Ms. Reding has long campaigned for major changes in European boardrooms and had given industry “a last chance” to improve its record on placing women in top management.

Rav Hirsch explains that on Pesach the Jews primarily experienced physical freedom, which is symbolized by the korban omer. Barley, commonly used as animal fodder, signifies physicality. The shtei halechem, the wheat bread sacrifice offered on Shavuot, symbolizes spiritual freedom. The Jews did not achieve complete freedom until they received the Torah. On the fiftieth day, when they finally attained the pinnacle of spiritual purity, they approach Hashem with human food. Rav Hirsch writes that the day after the Jews left Egypt they began to count sefira. This further demonstrates that the Exodus was only the beginning. It was not the goal.
We were up bright and early on the morning of Saturday, August 6th- not that it mattered much since I could barely sleep the night before due to all the excitement :) Because we had to leave for the church at noon, the girls and I were at the hair salon by 8am and back to the guest house at Oceancliff to get dressed by 10:30am. I could hardly wait to FINALLY put on my wedding gown (and was praying that it would it zip! .... luckily it did ;)) and get the day I had been waiting all year for underway.

Jack and I got stopped at Customs. We were detained. After a long chat with the woman in the booth, who seemed quite pleasant, she suddenly started asking questions. Did we have any firearms? Did we have any firearms at home? (I do, one antique shotgun that was my grandfather's, but why that's a concern of Canadians -- or any of their business -- is beyond me.) Where else have you lived? (A fairly long list of different states for me.) Do you have any alcohol? (A flask of whiskey for personal use only.) Jack wisely said "No" to most of these questions, but I just couldn't help being truthful.
It should come as no surprise that it's a Night Shade published title. Putting aside its similarity to Glen Cook, one of Night Shade's most prolific authors, Scourge of the Betrayer screams 'new voice'. Like last year's God's War (Hurley), it isn't reinterpreting old genre conventions, but finding entirely new pathways. Once again I find myself applauding Night Shade for its editorial vision, further cementing them as my go to source for something I've never seen before. I can't wait to read whatever's next for Jeff Salyards. His debut can't be considered anything but a tremendous success.

Gerald stared around. Heaven, huh? Not what he’d expected at all. Admittedly some of the trappings were there but for him it was all a façade. Oh it was all right for the Senior Gods, they had it made – he’d glimpsed into their private realm. Cavorting maidens, simpering sylphs, tables laden with fruit, candy, cakes, wine… What did he need to do to reach that divine enclave? Perhaps the gods were assessing him. Perhaps he needed to pass some test, prove himself.

So we've chosen together. Reached unanimity. Are yet to submit the forms. Feel reassured by our choice. Hope she'll yet pass the tests. And are conscious that this is another rite of passage in parenting, premature in our case, but which I'd guess most go through. Preparing as best you can. Trying to do the best you can in the situation in which you find yourself. Being clear that the child knows, whatever happens, you are there for them. Rehearsing scenarios, together. And then, tearfully, fearfully, standing back, and letting them take control.
I won't lie. I felt like I was sprinting, and it was a little painful. But I didn't feel like I was going to die, so I just kept pushing myself. One foot in front of the other. We turned a corner and then all of a sudden we turned onto a gravel road. WHAT? I was not expecting gravel. My lungs were burning and I was ticked about the stupid gravel. Really, it isn't that big of a deal, just something I wasn't planning on, you know? Anyway, then I saw the 1 mile marker. Lungs on fire, thighs on fire, two miles to go. The entire second mile, and at a least half of the third were all on gravel. When I finally hit pavement again I was so incredibly happy (not to mention it was a bit of a downhill and the last quarter mile, woot!). Pretty much the entire third mile I was thinking I couldn't make it. That I had gone out too fast and I wouldn't be able to finish at that speed. I more or less argued with myself in my head for five minutes about whether or not to slow down. But when I reached that last quarter mile I decided to go big or go home.

Luckily for us, historical forces have shaped the world in such a way that monogamy is a more common moral ideal today than any other system. While their priests still don't marry, for example, the contemporary Catholic Church is extremely supportive of the married couples who form the core of most Catholic communities. Jews in medieval Europe dropped plural marriage so as not to offend their neighbors and have continued to hold to monogamy since; Mormons abandoned our limited practice of plural marriage after less than fifty years of practicing it and are now devoutly monogamous.

Let's face it, there's a lot more at stake from "You're cute. Wanna go out?" to "I've tried and tried but I can't stop thinking of you. I love you and can't keep this to myself any longer," even if we don't add the gender element. So, yeah, being the man to man up and admit his feelings is no easy task nor one, I'd think, a man would take lightly except in the right environment (like say a gay bar where, hopefully, his odds of finding a prickly non-gay recipient are less).

“How can we help our youngsters and our kids to develop to the highest level possible? What structures can we give them? The introduction of a 10-month season is just one of these pieces. It’s crucial that we adjust to the global game. It’s crucial that we understand that soccer is not a seasonal sport. Soccer is a sport that is played 12 months of the year. In most of the soccer nations, it’s really played 11, 11 and a half months out of the year. How can we compete with those nations? Whatever it takes in the discussion and what is ideal for 10- to 14-year-olds and further up, what is ideal for all these kids, then you should adjust. We need to find a tier-driven environment because we need to give a lot of the younger players the opportunity to get enough games per year. If you look at the players between 18 and 22 years of age and you summarize all the amount of games they really have and see if they are part of an MLS system, then maybe simply it’s not enough. It’s really worth it to get everybody at the same table sooner or later and discuss all those topics. It’s not me coming in and saying this is what we need, it’s really everybody involved that needs to come together and say, ‘This is how we need our players to grow more effectively, to grow more continuously and not drop off in a couple of months here and a couple of months there as often was the case.’ But this is a huge topic.”

The Browns second round pick Mitchell Schwartz will end up being just as important as Trent Richardson and Brandon Weeden. Mitchell is a right tackle, and this this is a very important position on the Browns offensive line. The left side of the line is pretty solid with pro bowl left tackle Joe Thomas anchoring that side. An offense can not run effectively with out the line giving the quarterback time to throw, and opening up holes for the running back.

She throws doubt on to whether radar technology actually works, ponders why there isn't a crater when the meteorite/sphere crash lands to earth and laughs at the model shot of the TARDIS arriving. She also points out to me that when this originally aired no one would have known what the Doctor was going to look like when he fell from the TARDIS doors. I'm sure it would have been out there in the press but younger viewers in particular would have been unaware. How exciting that must have been!
A restaurant that is in my top 10 favorite restaurants in Chipotle! I love the tacos, I love the burrito bowls, and of course I love the chips, salsa, and guacamole! I tried to recreate the burrito bowl a few times and failed! I could never catch all of the flavors that are in the original. Then my sister showed me a post on a blog called Iowa Girl Eats, which recreated perfectly. I made it exactly like she said the first time, then every time since then I have made my own little changes. I add corn and red onion with the beans, the seasonings also tend to change based on what I have on hand, and I ALWAYS add homemade guacamole! So feel free to make your own changes that better suite your family's tastes!

Having been taught at the art academy myself for Interaction Design in the early ’90s, one thing you learn early enough is that someone is an artist who can create a creative product out of passion, instead of commercial purposes, unrelated to the effect it has on an audience. This does not mean that a true artist is someone who lives a live of starvation and anarchy, defying everything that the society likes to consider as rules; it means that an artist creates, unrelated to how the audience responds. Art does not mean it cannot be a commercial success. Steven Spielberg is a real artist, Martin Scorsese, Walt Disney… and many more. Even though they ended up to become very wealthy persons, commercially very successful, their careers started unrelated to the financial success, often risking everything to follow their dreams. And I consider, knowing a bit now about the history of Mr. Stern, Mr Stern indeed an artist.
I work and concentrate best, I’ve found, away from home. In my apartment, I get too distracted, listless. My internet is out this week, so I can’t even blame the world wide web as a whole. I don’t know what it is about being in whatever place I’m calling home at the moment, but I can never really concentrate whilst there. If I have a great book I’m eager to read, a piece I need to write, or some other sort of work to get done, my best bet is a coffee shop. Currently, I live exactly one block away from my very favorite coffee shop, so it’s never an issue of getting there when I want to read or have work to do. And thus, I’m on a first name basis with most of the people that work there.

In looking at Jacob’s encounter we have seen that different motivations drive us to God and for Jacob it was family issues and problems. We have seen family issues do drive us to seek the presence of God and they push us to seek direction from God about them. We also talked about the paradox that we must give up the most precious things in order get all that God has for us. We will encounter God when it seems like everything is lost. God will also encounter those that seek There are some tough things to learn but if you wrestle with God you will find that God does not want things easy for us but He simply wants us to hold on tight to Him through all we go through.
We have made it matter. By labeling ourselves as “speculative fiction on the rise” we have made it more about genre than about content. Also, there are several realities that we just have to face. The majority of CBA customers are women interested in romance. Argue all you want about why that is the case, but it is true. If the trend is ever going to be broken, even your speculative work must find a way to nab a portion of that market (heaven forbid!). You can’t cross the bridge until you build it, and there are easy ways to make your speculative novel more attractive to the female reader. First and foremost, the LOVE story. Do you have one? Is it prominent? If not, I may not even be interested in reading it. What’s an epic without love, the most epic thing we know? Also, sorry to say, but your book about alien invaders who suck out people’s brains is not going to do well. At least not right now. First we have to move the trend…get science fiction and fantasy readers to look for new books in Christian bookstores, then turn it up a notch (maybe not quite that far, but you know what I mean). This is where I think the debate gets confused. Just because a few speculative titles (probably poorly promoted) fail to do well does not mean that none ever will. Genre is supposed to serve as a guide for readers, but because of this debate “speculative” has turned into a major obstacle for authors with publishers and agents. You can almost see them turn up their noses when you read, “no sci-fi or fantasy” on their websites. I don’t fault them for that, but they have become part of the vicious cycle of No marketing, No sales, No titles, No customers. If a title has good content and good marketing, it will find its niche market and spread from there, thus creating more sales and drawing more customers in, creating demand for more titles. Seems simple, right?

Ok, ok, I’ll admit; these are definitely fine lines to walk on. More commercial genres of adult have voices that can sound very close to YA. Take Janet Evanovich; her writing is as sarcastic and “I” centered as any teen novel. What sets these apart are the mature situations -- not to say that YA books don’t, or can’t, deal with mature situations, but HOW the characters confront them is very different.

The Congo Diamond Tiara was one of Grand Duchess Joséphine Charlotte's wedding presents, and she chose to wear it for her wedding ceremony. She then passed it on to her daughter-in-law, Maria Teresa, and both of her daughters for their wedding days. That's a strong start to a tradition - but it hasn't been worn by a bride since then. Furthermore, the family almost sold this tiara after the Grand Duchess's death, in an effort to divide her assets (the proposed auction of quite a lot of Joséphine Charlotte's jewels and other valuables was cancelled after it caused public outcry). So we wait to see if the tradition will or will not continue.

This is because some of the nation’s religious scholars – and we do not underestimate them, for they are good people… But due to a certain confusion, they had dissenting views on the martyrdom operations, and this caused us great embarrassment. However, in his unequivocal fatwa, the sheik, may Allah reward him, considered martyrdom operations to be the most noble level of Jihad. That was unparalleled support for the people of Palestine, because, brothers and sisters, you cannot imagine how difficult it is psychologically for a young Palestinian man or woman to sacrifice themselves or what is most dear to them, only to encounter a conflict in their minds and hearts as to whether they are on the path of righteousness, or whether they are committing a religious violation.

One I picked up my sweet tea and my order, I looked around for a seat. Not finding one, I did spot a sign that read “picnic area out back.” I wasn’t sure if this was some joke, along the lines of all the other signs, to pick at unsuspecting visitors, but I tried it anyway. I made my way past the kitchen, through a screen door, past a washing area, and old pit, and into a small field out back. Sure enough, picnic tables lined the sides of the field nearest the trees, and most were full. I took a spot at an empty table and dug in to my plate.

Writers must read voraciously. As a writer, I read constantly–much of the time for pleasure, but sometimes for education’s sake. I like to learn different techniques and there is no better way to do this than to read the best and analyze their tactics and decisions. Here are the ten books I’ve read recently that I would recommend. Each writer, in the book I’ve chosen, masters their genre–whether it be general fiction, biography, reflection/memoir, or historical fiction.
This will be Virgin’s first A330 fitted with business class, and will sport 33 seats over nine rows (in a mosty 1-2-1 layout) in the same space where the current A330s have 59 premium economy seats (arranged 2-3-2).
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) in London analysed 116 drone strikes on Pakistan between August 2010 and June 29, 2011. In its ‘conservative estimate’, TBIJ reveals that in 10 drone strikes at least 45 civilians have been killed, including six named children. At least 15 additional strikes are likely to have killed at least 65 more civilians. While the investigation is a rare glimpse into a big atrocity, it might have underestimated civilian deaths. The atrocity is being replicated in Yemen and Libya, the “Pakistanisation” of Yemen and Libya.

An 02 2500 4X4 sexy beast. It's PERFECT...but I knew it was too good to be true. It's a damn automatic. WHYYYYYY???????????????? UGH. I cringed as I walked up to the window to look in and only see the 4X4 stick on the floor :( Damn it. But...I figured I'd go in and ask about it anyway. It only has 120K miles. My heart sunk even more. It's so CLLEEEEAN. And it's got some upgrades. It's got a massive 5" exhaust on it and I saw 3 aftermarket gauges in it. That could be good or bad. I'm thinking about going back and driving it today. They want $12,995 for it. Wayne says don't settle for something less than what I want. He's right. I've made that mistake before. These trucks are just hard to come by with the mileage I want and the transmission. I'm on cars.com, Craigslist, eBay, and Diesel Trader every day. I'm willing to go out of state for one. Laurie got her new 3500 from a GIANT dealer in Kellogg, Idaho. She said it might be worth my time to give them a call and see what they have or what they can find. The guy at the dealer with the truck in the pic said he tries to stay away from manuals because people don't want them. Huh? Ok. Well, I want one. My truck is out there...somewhere. So, if any of you guys know of one or see one LET ME KNOW! Doesn't matter what state!
I was dumbfounded by her remark. I started to wonder whether I had imagined it all. Was it just teenage angst? The people I was closest to - my best friend and my parents - seemed to tell me so. After much pleading, my parents eventually let me switch school, and I ended up attending one with a progressive reputation. Some teachers were dedicated, but the kids obviously took advantage of the situation, and yes, there was still bullying there. But by that time, I had learned to be invisible. And when after GCSEs, most of the school bullies had dropped out, I rejoiced. I still feel a trace of triumph as I write this now.

Later on, I'd referee Against the Giants for friends and I can recount many a tale of their exploits, such as an opportune use of creeping doom against a roomful of hill giants and inter-party strife after the discovery of a ring of three wishes in the Glacial Rift. If a module's goodness is to be judged solely on the fun had while playing it, I think Against the Giants has to be one of the most fun of all. I'll always hold it in special regard, because it symbolizes that weird time when I was initiated into the hobby that I'd have for the rest of my life.
The next morning, we all met around 9:00 for the breakfast part of our B&B stay. The meal was so French: fresh fruit, baguettes and butter/jam, and a variety of tarts.

I always feel as though I'm waiting for something but for some odd reason I'm on the wrong platform or walked into the wrong store or walked the wrong different path. Maybe I'll find what I'm looking for or it'll find it's way to me. If GPS locating systems were free and had emotional detectors and everyone had one would people be able to find each other better? For example it could tell that I'm supposed to be at that street corner because a future best friend would be lingering there....or that Im supposed to sit at that stool in that bar to share an intimate conversation with the dreamy guy whose plans fell through and needed some company? But I guess the not knowing is all part of the fun of life. But maybe I'm on the right path and it merely just has cloudy reception today.
It is clear from all these issues that fundamentally the building was poorly designed. The main problem with the building is that although an example of modernist architecture it is not a good one.

This obituary for Emilie Schindler, the wife Oskar was never faithful to, tells a bit more of her own side of the story. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1358768/Emilie-Schindler.html Emilie states in this article ‘that he had no trace of anti-Semitism and that he counted his workers among his friends, and indeed his mistresses.’

Next step: rip and scrape off as much of the paper as possible. At a complete loss for any idea to keep this disaster from snowballing, I could come up with nothing other than to cover it with more of the blue ocean map. Once I had done that, it became clear that it was too light, and therefore not helping the contrast problem at all. Darkening it seemed the only solution, so I added layers of acrylic ink until I thought the value was dark enough (you can see this below). Problematically, the map didn't absorb the ink well, instead building up a gloppy surface somewhat like a floor that's been waxed too many times without being stripped.

As we had driven up the on-ramp to I-70 heading east out of Salina, Utah that night I remember my mom saying in a concerned tone, “It’s already snowing pretty bad. Are you sure we should keep going?” Two hours later we were sliding back and forth on a road I remembered traveling the previous summer. Even in the warmth of June and with dry dirt the road had scared me. I had actually ducked my head down just to not look out the window during that drive because I’d been so scared. Now, in the dead of winter, and knowing we were now sliding back and forth and that same road, I was doing the death grip on the back of my mother’s seat in the Bronco. To everyone else in the vehicle it had been a good time. Never mind that the roads we were riding on had cliffs reminiscent of an Indiana Jones movie. As we continued driving further, ascending higher, and encountering deeper snow, the mood in the vehicle quickly changed from jovial to tense. Finally my uncle, driving his Bronco, gave into the pleadings of my good aunt who seemed just as nervous now as I did. Upon reaching a small clearing and wide spot my uncle quickly turned the Bronco around and we began our descent down the mountain pass.

In his readable Five Evangelical Leaders, 3 Christopher Catherwood devotes nearly four pages to this event which he calls 1966: Crossing the Rubicon.4 He refers to “a change of emphasis” in his grandfather’s thinking concerning the doctrine of the Church, but, as we have documented in earlier articles, this new emphasis was not sudden or unexpected but had been apparent for some time prior to 1966. One wonders how well the author understood the background to the 1966 address. For example, he claims that the Evangelical Alliance “had no idea how explosive the Doctor intended to be…”5 and refers to Lloyd-Jones’s “vision of a United Evangelical Church”.6 Later, Catherwood sees the “tragedy ofthe split” as being divided over what was “essentially an ecclesiastical issue”.7 But the prior and major issue for Lloyd-Jones was the Gospel itself; it was from the Gospel that he insisted on the importance ofthe nature and unity ofthe Church. Soteriology and ecclesiology were inextricably bound up, not only in the thinking of Lloyd-Jones but also in the New Testament itself. Kenneth Hylson-Smith’s useful book Evangelicals in the Church of England 1734-1984 is disappointing in its treatment of 18th October 1966. Barely two pages are devoted to the subject9 and, unfortunately, it is based on secondary sources, primarily Christopher Catherwood’s Five Evangelical Leaders. 10 The author is correct in claiming that the effect of the disagreement between Stott and Lloyd-Jones “was immediate and long-standing”.11

Large numbers are another matter. They tend to re-create examples of what they have left behind. There is less pressure for all to learn the language and adapt to mainstream British culture and to “the-way-we-do-things”. As numbers grow there is competition for housing, benefits and education. The white indigenous population starts to feel threatened. In Britain this racial transition has been very rapid. It was only twenty years after Windrush when Enoch Powell issued his famous warning. Over forty years on the situation is immeasurably worse. What marks the precise threshold when we cross from low level and tolerable immigration – defined as being tolerable to the white, host society – and move towards to mass non-white immigration is not easy to define even for professional demographers. But one thing can be stated with complete certainty: there is huge unease among the white indigenous population in Britain about the country’s racial make up and what this bodes for the future.

This script just feels like it’s weighing me down. Most of my scenes, especially the last 20 pages, are just the characters rambling at each other, sometimes fighting, sometimes just talking. I’ve thrown them out of planes, had them fall off rock cliffs, and given them waterburn from water skiing. It sounds much more interesting than it is, but no director or producer is ever going to see this. No public is ever going to view this movie up on screen and say, “I hope her parachute doesn’t open and she splats on the ground.”

Any wise person would insist that our society needs to learn how to accept death as a part of life. I think of Kim, and her grace and honesty as her own death approached, and I understand this now in a way that I did not before. While I am in great health now, I know also that I am here on loan, and by the same grace she was. What Kim taught me, in the way she lived before she was sick, and the way she remained herself afterwards, was to embrace and to be and to love. To cherish those many, many connections that make us feel life all the more deeply. And writing these letters is a way for me to express that in some way.
If you will go back to your younger years and try to recall those years when you were growing up, perhaps you will remember how you started from being 4 1/2 feet and eventually grew into 5 feet tall or more. Then there is a certain time when you noticed that growing has left you out; that no matter how plenty you ate or how much milk you drank, or perhaps there were several other things you did; bottom-line is, you just suddenly stopped growing.

It is good to have empathy, and wish to look inside yourself for why you might be cautious in the same situation where another person is expressing some concern. But beware of the risk of presuming the other person is driven by the same wants, and therefore the same fears that account for your own behavior. In fact, the other person may not be like you at all in some ways you might otherwise think they are, and therefore take for granted something that just isn’t true at all.
Hello Gleeks! I can’t tell you what a relief it is to be surrounded by people that understand how unsatisfying it is to be confined to singing that completely relevant and appropriate song to myself, in my head, all the time. It is so nice to know that I can count on you to always be near a piano, always know the harmony, and always know the perfect dance moves at the exact moment I am ready to express my emotions through song. Before Glee, I didn’t know such magic was possible. I put this life lesson into place almost immediately after the premier of the show. I still get some weird looks from time to time, but I know it just might take everyone else a little bit of time to warm up to this idea…FALSE. That doesn’t happen. That is not real life.

Another gimmick pushes much of the legislation’s costs off the federal budget and onto the private sector by requiring individuals and employers to purchase health insurance. When the bills force somebody to pay $10,000 to the government, the Congressional Budget Office treats that as a tax. When the government then hands that $10,000 to private insurers, the CBO counts that as government spending. But when the bills achieve the exact same outcome by forcing somebody to pay $10,000 directly to a private insurance company, it appears nowhere in the official CBO cost estimates — neither as federal revenues nor federal spending. That’s a sharp departure from how the CBO treated similar mandates in the Clinton health plan. And it hides maybe 60 percent of the legislation’s total costs. When I correct for that gimmick, it brings total costs to roughly $2.5 trillion (i.e., $1 trillion/0.4).
Let’s look at some examples of how social media has been used in past disasters:

What’s your favourite way to cook eggs? Broken, flipped, mutilated. It might as well be my favourite, because that’s how they end up.
One reason that I’ve been terminated from certain jobs that I’ve had was because me and the other few guys there were in a minority. The women all ganged up and started drama just because the job was easy and there was nothing else to do. It felt like high school all over again… Next thing I knew was that the poor boss (who was a man) was pulling me aside saying there had been complaints. Complaints for what, may I ask? Oh this bullshit excuse and some other extremely exaggerated truth. I’m not saying I’m perfect. But I’m not that delinquent.

I am always wary of giving my students books written outside of a typical narrative style like Unfinished Angel is. At the same time, I want to expose them to different ways of storytelling and stretch their imaginations. Besides, it’s just a nice story with a hopeful ending. It also teaches about kids and poverty and family in a very real and sensitive way (this is where the hope comes in, too).
I know I’m not the only gay conservative who has been asked this question. I’ve given a myriad of responses, depending on my mood, ranging from “I prefer not to be thought of an ass who can be guided using a ‘carrot on a stick’ approach” to “being able to get married to another woman is not really my biggest worry at this moment in time” or whole discussions on why marriage shouldn’t be in the purview of the government at all and discussions on why this ridiculous view that all Republicans and all Democrats feel the same way about gay people.
I came across the word Muhajir for the first time in the film Sarfarosh when the Pakistani High Commissioner in the film referred to Naseeruddin Shah as a Muhajir. The conversation thereafter replays the bitterness of Shah’s character and a feeling of homelessness in spite of being in the country of his own kind. Reading the book foregrounds similar politics of that film in a large way. Or it is all about who is a Karachiwala or a Karachiite!
In the second interval, I went to the toilet and encountered the very large black man with one eye, a speech defect, a shaven head, a beard and what appeared to be an MP3 player plugged into his ears. It turned out he didn’t quite have a totally shaven head. He had a slogan which I could not quite read shaved in hair around the back of his head.

I have to assume, somewhere deep in my heart, that the world will take care of me if I keep on doing what I love, and throwing my pleasure and joy and enthusiasm for it all around me like birdseed at a wedding. I have to assume that, put my head down, and write more songs.
Robert Herrick’s poem from whence the title of this entry is taken is “To the Virgins, to make much of time. ” Of course, from my perspective it is little more than an earlier century’s version of a young man trying to get a young woman into bed. However, the line “gather ye rosebuds” when not necessarily applied in this context can be quite apt in describing my now-philosophy of life. As I am now middle aged, I pay more attention to the commercials, and books and other media which tell you to plan for retirement, to sacrifice, to hold back that much more percentage of your pre-tax paycheck for your “golden years’. I am planning, of course, for retirement but I also realize the harsh reality that today might be my last day on this planet and that none of us is guaranteed those years of freedom from work. This is a very future-oriented society: we are told we can have x, y or z when we grow up and the we must wait for the promotion, the house, the vacations. People who live in poor and desperate circumstances are often criticized by the middle classes for being too “present-oriented”, however, that is the only way one can be when one is in survival mode and, often surrounded by dangers. There is neither a right nor wrong to it yet it is a huge mistake not to live every day as if you had no tomorrow or, perhaps only a month or two to live.

I wish I had Kung Fu superpowers.
Although we are morally culpable for our actions, it can also be said that even the first sin in our race was not committed in a vacuum. The serpent in Eden, later identified as Satan or the devil, tempted Eve and prevailed. The Lord had commanded that the man and woman not eat from a single tree in the center of Eden. Satan attacked at that point and helped bring forth the sin. And so we need to ask for protection from his schemes.
But if I have to pick one, then I pick the one that instantly brightens my mood as soon as I hear it: “Lovely Day” – Bill Withers. You just cannot remain in a funk after hearing this song. Impossible.
This is a becoming pilgrimage. The sculptures assume their affect because the spectators are with the sculpture; they bring their curiousity and content. Serra says that a work of his “ includes and is dependent on memory and anticipation.”[7] Orientation through the piece, how to walk through it, unpredictable, alter the routines of navigating around an art piece, exploration, the curved walls, sky or floor are the lines of flight, guided pathways. To experience the structure is an exchange, a resonance. To walk is to ruminate, process. This is how Serra’s structures at Dia Beacon constitute my immanent art experience. Activated by the spectator, the art becomes a living matter.

A young woman appears and sets down a violin case, from which she very quickly produces a violin. She snaps the case closed and takes her place among the remaining musicians.

What is clear is something is going to give because the stress of liberal positions will lead to profoundly illiberal politics. Some of my friends who are Hegelian Marxists would call this regression in history, but I think this is regression to the mean and a conservatism to maintain it, which of course, actually undoes the attitude that enabled it.

A Congress functionary in Uttar Pradesh, Yusuf Ansari, talks revealingly about the complexities of local politics and the weaknesses of the Congress Party at grassroots. The Indian telecom baron Sunil Mittal, head of Bharti Airtel, recalls, in a passage that is almost novelistic, wandering about street markets and trade fairs in east Asia in the eighties, looking for a business opportunity, before finally picking on phones as a growth area for the future. A fatalistic, enfeebled low-caste labourer in Karnataka who spent 21 months in chains, unable to put on underwear or trousers, after failing to pay off a debt to his employer, puzzles over his own story after he is freed. Nor far away, in the buzzing metropolis of Bangalore, a construction worker takes French around the pathetic camp thrown together for him and his colleagues by a company erecting premium apartments.

Of course, some Muslim criminals are already deported from European countries. Here, however, I refer to the deportation of anyone of Muslim heritage, citizen of their host country or no. It would need to be decided which crimes warranted deportation, and which groups could have their members deported should those members be so foolish as to be convicted of breaking the relevant laws. Once these decisions had been made, however, a significant fraction of the young, male Muslim population of any European country would fairly shortly be available for deportation, especially if relevant new legislation were to be applied retroactively. The ability to break up families and generally destroy the confidence of Muslims in their status in European countries would be at least as significant as the actual deportations. Additionally, the Muslim unrest that would undoubtedly result from any such large-scale deportations would provide a fresh stream of ‘volunteers’ to be deported, making it a potentially very potent weapon in the hands of committed de-Islamizers.

If a hand-held mic is being used, make sure the guest knows how to use it. If possible, let the interviewer and guest have a short preparatory conversation before the actual interview begins. This ensures they are both comfortable with each other’s audio level and quality, and helps relax the guest.
This is before we consider what is in some cases the organised criminality amongst the agencies of the State. Odessa is home to three very active ports. Odessa, Illychovsk and Yushni.

Despite the fact that the book felt like it might fall apart in my hands, the stories were vivid and engaging, the voices of the storytellers enlivening the tales. Few wolverine lovers will have the opportunity to experience the deep cultural relationships that exist between humans and animals in subsistence hunting cultures, and I wanted to convey some of this here on the blog. So I wrote to Robert Brightman, and he kindly granted me permission to excerpt the wolverine stories. I also asked if it might be possible to get in touch with the original storytellers to ask for their permission, but they have passed on. So with respect and thanks to them for sharing their stories, I will present their wolverine tales here over the next few posts.
This album is so terribly difficult to approach with the tools given to me by any previous musical experience… It’s such a tremendously protean mix of references and genres that I can’t find any one dominant to start from – the music is simply too slippery, too restless. Spanning from circus music, to post-rock drones, to lush violins reminiscent of romantic classical music, break beat percussion, industrial sound effect, theatrical pacing, vocal samples taken from films, acoustic guitar tunes akin to the most harmless, sunny folk and bass lines of unrelenting ferocity, this album is a monumental confusion engine which would normally tear itself apart, but somehow, supernaturally, it doesn’t. Some laws still function, some sense is still there to be found and the devil is in the details.

I would lose a few pounds (5-10) and put it right back on again.

There is just so much that happens as a young adult and as we transition from childhood to adulthood. Despite the intensity of emotion and living, it is one of the most carefree times of our lives. We are not hampered by the responsibilities of adulthood, and we are no longer hamstrung by the well-intentioned restraints of our parents. It is also the first time we are given to a wide range of freedom of expression which is taken seriously not only by our peers but the adults around us. It’s a time when we create so many of our own stories and are part of so many of the stories of those around us. It is hugely fertile ground.

To me the NBA is the one major league in the US (your time will come soon, soccer), where the players dominate. The league reaches a level of personality that you cannot see in any other sport. Sure every sport has a few people who radiate that personality (Ken Griffey Jr., Alexander Ovechkin, and Terrell Owens come to mind immediately), but the NBA differs. Yes, they run plays, and each team has its own philosophy, but each and every player has their own distinct way of playing. For example Dwight Howard and Andrea Bargnani are pretty similar body types, but could you think of two more opposite players? But this isn’t just about body types, take the most highlighted play: the dunk. (Almost) Everyone does it, but a Vince Carter dunk is very different than that of Blake Griffin.

That's why I'm a proud, shameless flexitarian. Yeah, that is a word now. Really. Don't ask me why it was invented when before we were all happy omnivores, but I accept trends as part of my modern life and wear the flexitarian badge proudly as I know it allows me into exclusive clubs like "I Practice Meatless Mondays" and "I Love To Snuggle With Fur But I Dare Not Harm An Animal". So when a vegan recipe comes along that is being touted as the best vegan anything, my meaty nostrils flare in disbelief. When I find myself still curiously salivating the next day, I know its time to switch on my vegan self and give it a try. What do you know, these really are the best damn cookies ever. The fact that some hard working chickens could keep their babies in the process, just another bonus.

He was relatively well-supplied. I found two handguns, two rifles – an AK-47 and Remington bolt-action – a sawed off shotgun and several rounds of ammunition for every firearm. He had a nice backpack packed like a bug-out bag. He had food and water and medical supplies. There was a pretty nice tent in the back of the truck, a couple tarps …. This was not a guy out for a short drive.
Cole worked Midnight into a similar formula as Plastic Man. Namely, that of a sane man surrounded by loonies. However, with Midnight, there were a few misfires that may have seemed like a good idea at the time, but which leeched a great deal of potential out of the series. These misfires included moving Dave Clark’s inventive streak (he invented the vacuum gun) to Doc Wackey and surrounding the hero with a whole family of sidekicks so that no one single character ever got enough air time to develop of as anything more than a two-dimensional figure in the story.
