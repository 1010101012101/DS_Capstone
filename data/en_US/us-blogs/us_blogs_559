To start, I painted the edges of each page with Ranger Paint Dabber and then covered each one with paper. I used the UHU Stic to glue it all in place and then used my Crop-A-Dile to repunch the holes. A light sanding around the edges adds a bit of “time” to the album and gets rid of any paper hanging over the edge.
It’s always fun to think about various “what ifs?” in both pop culture and history. What if The Beatles didn’t break up? What if someone went back to 1931 Germany and killed Hitler? What if…
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done,
It’s as simple as that. The pledge does give me a lot of latitude—anywhere from continuing on with this blog to telling a stranger about a great book I read. Does it mean I’ll be writing a book soon? It’s too early to tell. In the meantime I’ll go back to my investigative work: researching, reading, experimenting and evaluating the topics and tools we can all use to be happy. From there, I’ll leave the results up to the creation universe and see where it takes me.
Sher-e-punjab – One of the long-standing Lincolnite debates is The Oven or Sher-e-punjab? The owner of Sher-e-punjab used to work at The Oven and specializes in the same kind of north Indian food that made The Oven a downtown staple. Sher-e-punjab is located about a half mile east of The Oven on the edge of Lincoln’s downtown in a strip mall that also houses a breakfast restaurant, a Cost Cutters and a couple other businesses. So it doesn’t have the atmosphere or location that makes The Oven so spectacular. That said, the food here isverygood and sometimes a less upscale atmosphere is actually really nice. If you’re keen to avoid the crowds of the Haymarket, Sher-e-punjab is an excellent choice.

In my ears I have the second book following The Game of Thrones. It’s full of wonderful voices and great stories of struggle and strife for power. But, I am also reading paper again – still testing to see which one will grab my full attention.
At least six deaths were blamed on a storm that went through the northwest Oklahoma town of Woodward and destroyed more than 100 homes and businesses. Woodward County emergency management director Matt Lehenbauer said that the sixth person passed away after he was brought to an Amarillo, Texas hospital the morning after the tornadoes hit. CBS This Morning (CTM) added that 28 people were injured.

Right after graduation Dan went into the hospital for a routine tonsillectomy. He was 17, older than the average age for the procedure but not unusual. The surgery was not routine. His carotid artery was nicked during the procedure. It seemed to be healing, but days later when the scabs fell off and the artery expanded it began to bleed.

There is also a danger to Muslim women. Some religious authorities in Muslim communities have forbidden Muslims to marry out of the Muslim community. Why? If a Muslim marries a non-Muslim woman, and since a Muslim woman is only allowed to marry a Muslim man – who will she marry? If all the men go off and find themselves Western blondes to marry, our own daughters – Fatma, ‘Aisha, and so and so – will find no one to marry.

Socinianism: a Unitarian theology which teaches that Christ is not divine, but a normal mortal man born through the Holy Spirit and then re-born in the resurrection to be immortal. So although his death wasn’t an atoning sacrifice, his death is still important as a revelation of the love of God and was still accepted as a ground of forgiveness.
This Kingdom will have no end. Remember that in order for a kingdom to be eternal two criteria must be met. First, the King must be able to reign eternally, and second, the King must be able to reign perfectly. We have talked about the “Son of Man,” the “Ancient of Days,” and now the “Alpha and the Omega.” Each passage has talked about some aspect of a never ending Kingdom or a King that shall reign in complete Sovereignty.
I've been on a bit of an odyssey lately. I've been increasingly tired of wearing the same three outfits to church and coming home to stare at fabric that cost a small fortune or going into town for chores and looking like something the cat dragged in with my t-shirts with holes at the belly-button. Ugh. But... it's the same small fortune that also (kind of) keeps me from sewing all my fabric up. I don't want to waste the money I've spent and the fabric that I love so much by making something that I'll never wear.
The Texas Forensic Science Commission voted unanimously Friday to open an investigation into two complaints about the Austin Police Department crime lab's testing of drug evidence.
Even Protestant scholars will acknowledge that Peter seemed have been designated with more authority that the other apostles by Jesus and based on NT evidence. But then they will contend that this authority was not passed on to another via apostolic succession. But I ask, why would Jesus designate an authoritative leader for His Church that would only last for the remainder of Peter’s short life? If the Church needed leadership in the first century, where many knew Jesus personally and knew the apostles and those who were taught by them, why would later generations not need this same authority and sure guide to the truth?

“It was very well done and it’s great for the kids to know what you’re talking about,” said Chris McEvoy of Canton.
As I warned at the beginning, I haven’t covered all the points I intended to cover, but I think it’s time to reclaim this blog for non-Elsevier-related posts. That doesn’t mean that there won’t be further news about Elsevier. There will, and my interest in the subject is as strong as ever. But the change that many of us have hoped for for a long time is not going to happen overnight, so I’m going to write about other things as well. Meanwhile, I hope that if you agree with the objectives of the boycott, then you will think about what you can do to help — things like making sure that your papers are easily available online, encouraging others to do the same, not submitting to an expensive journal when a cheap one is equally suitable (which I know is not always), supporting new cheap journals and publishing methods, and so on.

“In his hometown of Portland, a wake will be in full swing by 3 p.m. at the Horse Brass Pub. Attendees at the time will be raising their glasses to Don.

In 1961, Qaradawi moved to Qatar, where he currently resides. Despite his departure from Egypt, Qaradawi’s theological influence on the Muslim Brotherhood continued. Qaradawi participated in developing the educational and cultural structure of the Brotherhood, publishing essays and books that were absorbed into the educational curriculum by its Tarbiyya (Education) Department. In addition, a number of Qaradawi’s essays relating to Thaqafat ad-Da’iya (The Culture of the Preacher) were published in the Brotherhood magazine, Da’wa, during in the 1970s. Another of his books, at-Tarbiya al-Islamiyya wa Madrasat Hassan al-Banna (Islamic Education and Hassan al-Banna’s school), published in 1979, was officially incorporated into the educational curriculum by the Brotherhood.

Planting seeds, on the other hand, is more gratifying and rewarding in some ways. The sense of anticipation, waiting for those first shoots to appear, is worth the wait. You go out day after day and water the soil. Each day you look for signs of life, already knowing there won’t be any.

Former congressman, Richard W.

He is right now.

There are so many obstacles it’s hard to know where to begin, but all aspiring writers should concentrate on only one thing - writing the best book possible. Not because it follows a formula or because it’s what they think publishers want - but because it’s what they want to write. Their passion will show through in their words. Once they get the book right, it will be much easier to find a good agent and then a supportive publisher.

Again, I slept early last night, I don’t know but these past few days I can easily shut my eyes.

These three statements are true. Every single person should be proud of themselves and what they have accomplished. Every person should be happy and hold his or her head high, for life is not easy, and making it this far is an accomplishment. All should all be able to look at themselves in the mirror and say “I love myself and I am wonderful.”
The media and the venomous coalition of forces who gathered around Durham North Carolina, intent upon sacrificing three innocent young men in order to prove true the lies they have told us for the last 40 years have not gone away, and they will strike again, and this time their aim will be even more deadly.
5. Don't expect a 2-year-old to act like an adult. Little children's brains are wired differently than adults'. And a 2-year-old's brain functions much differently than a 6-year-old's. Tantrums, meltdowns, and other big emotions are a normal part of childhood. I love the book The Science of Parenting for explaining age-appropriate responses to children's behavior.
If you run a website, you need to limit what visitors can do. You should only allow a program on your site if you wrote it yourself, or if you trust the developer who wrote it. But that may not be enough. If your website is one of several hosted on a shared server, you need to be extra careful. If a bad guy can compromise one of the other sites on the server, it’s possible he could extend his control to the server itself, in which he could control all of the sites on it—including yours. If you’re on a shared server, it’s important to find out what the server administrator’s policies are. (By the way, before opening your site to the public, make sure you’ve followed the security checklists for IIS 4.0 and IIS 5.0).

Usually, it's no problem. I just begin writing, but this time it's difficult. There are so many interlocking things I want to say without trying your patience or stamina too much. I've been lying in bed awake in the 5 am darkness wrestling with this, and I need to write something or I can't get it out of my head – which means I can't sleep. But I need the sleep. Catch 22.

Buchanan failed to fully inform Young of his intentions. As rumors spread of an impending American invasion, Young and other Mormon leaders reacted with alarm. Fearing the approaching federal army was actually just an armed mob similar to those that had previously driven the Mormons from Missouri and Illinois, Young was determined to make a stand. He mobilized the Mormon's huge militia, the Nauvoo Legion, and ordered it to implement a scorched earth policy in the Wasatch Mountains east of Salt Lake City to deprive the federal army of necessary forage and supplies. Meanwhile, Mormon citizens began manufacturing arms and ammunition in preparation for war.

Mani Ratnam’s Tamil film Bombay, which was released along with a dubbed Hindi version in 1993, is a film with two distinct sections. The first is a rapturous romance between a Brahmin man and a Muslim woman. The second follows the couple as they move to Mumbai, raise a family and get trapped in the 1992-’93 communal riots. Bombay was shot by advertising filmmaker and cinematographer Rajiv Menon, who also worked on Ratnam’s Guru in 2007, in addition to directing two of his own films (Minsaru Kanavu and Kandukondain Kandukondain).

Sure, I always wonder when he’ll wake up, because he’s still not a 10-12 hour sleeper. But I don’t let it consume me like I used to.

Brian Hughes was born on June 27, 1985, and raised in South Armagh. He started out in his native Ireland riding as a Flat apprentice. Having graduated from the Racing Academy and Centre of Education in Kildare in 2002, he rode for trainer Kevin Prendergast who provided him with his first winner when Perugino Lady won an apprentice handicap at Downpatrick on October 9, 1992. After three seasons and 19 wins on the Flat, rising weight prompted a full-time switch to jump racing. He was connected to the James Lambe stable for the 2004/05 season but relocated to Britain and the County Durham yard of Howard Johnson for the 2005/06 campaign. His career flourished after becoming stable jockey at Alan Swinbank’s North Yorkshire yard, a move that saw him crowned champion conditional at the end of the 2007/08 season with 39 wins on the board, most of them for Swinbank and County Durham permit holder John Wade. He partnered

Computer head has returned. No feeling, just lethargy. I can do things R asks of me (like researching the ins and outs of renting a kitchen and going into the retail food business canning and selling stuff he cooks), but the bed has been unmade for days (weeks? months? unsure and don’t care. well, I do care, I feel really guilty about it, but can’t make myself take care of it), and my room (Virginia Woolf and all that) is a mess. Just desk space for the keyboard and monitor, the crafts table behind me covered with crap so I can’t use it, but I can’t clear it off either. Let’s just refer to it as the crap table for now.

For the Christian Perspective, Jesus said one of my favorite things in Matthew 22:37-40. In the Old Testament, there are a couple hundred laws. It’s virtually impossible to memorize all of them, much less do all of them, but they were guiding a society that was springing up from nothing, so a lot of laws were created all at once. But Jesus simplified everything with this passage. He summed up the entire Law of God into this:

In the old days, authors had two reasonable choices when their publishers quit printing their books and the rights reverted back to the writers.
Oh my darling kitty, I agree.
That adds up to 109.5 lbs that I load up at least once a day for 5 days a week. Some days it's more than once depending on how many appts or places we are going. This does not even count how many times I am picking up & transporting Autumn from the floor to her bed to another room to her wheelchair to her stander to the car along with her suction machine & pulse ox that is always attached to her. Carrying Autumn is not like carrying any other 22 lb. toddler. She's like dead weight that hangs...actually she pulls your ears, tries to claw your face, or throws her body completely backwards while you carry her & her pulse ox machine. The scary part is knowing she's only 3 years old & is just going to get bigger & bigger. James already has a bad back so I really can't count on him for the future. I guess it's time for me to start seeing a chiropractor to keep my back healthy to be able to keep up the demands to care for Autumn. She's totally worth it though...all 109 pounds or more of lifting I do each day so she can have a "normal" & functional life. ;) I so love that girl!

In ordering clubs to release players, Fifa underline why they are at continual loggerheads with the clubs. They have not dropped the August international friendlies from the calendar once more undermining their arguments that they care about players.

The Frenzy of Renown is a truly fascinating book written in an eminently readable style, filled with the most compelling and interesting historical figures of the past and present. Being a 600 page non-fiction, the book does demand your time and attention, but it delivers on all counts. If you don’t think you’ll spend the time to read it, ask me some questions, I’ll tell you anything you want to know.

We ended up having McDonald's for dinner tonight. Yesterday I baked cupcakes for Lexi to take to school to celebrate her birthday. I used a boxed cake mix and realized that Jax and Clay wouldn't be able to eat the leftover cupcakes because of the artificial ingredients, so I made a batch of special cupcakes for them. I put chocolate chip cookie dough in the bottom of muffin cups and mixed up cheesecake filling for the top. Mmmm. Then I made hotdog buns for dinner. After that, Jackson reminded me that I needed to make like a thousand Greek cookies for him to take to school today for his cultural project. I think I was baked out yesterday, so it was McD's for dinner tonight.

The series I’m currently doing for a book packager has had its schedule put back a couple of months. The ins and outs of that particular project are confidential, but it got me to thinking how confusing and worrying delays can be for writers who don’t know much about the inside workings of publishing. Disturbing questions crop up in the mind, such as: “Is it because the publisher doesn’t like my manuscript after all, the project’s going to be dropped and the world will shortly end?”

I was originally going to put them all on one card in a quilt fashion for my Mom for Mother's Day, but they were too big to all fit nicely on one card front, so tonight when surfing my reading list of blogs, I saw Nichole's post about the Blog Hop and decided to put them on tags.

I completed all 6 sets. First two sets were one-handed, both arms, 3 reps each arm, done at 30 and then 35 pounds. I wanted to experiment with the two-handed sit ups that Dave posted in the video last night. We were warned not to be reckless, so I started with 25# in each hand for the first set. Like the fellow in the video, I anchored my feet in other kettle bells for all reps. It was not as difficult as I expected. I did a set of 5.

I got some transplants yesterday… I potted up the eggplants (black beauty) and peppers (Arianne, golden yellow, seranno, and one more–lipstick?) in one gallon pots and put them into the cold frame for hardening off. I’ll probably plant them on Mother’s Day or thereabouts…. they have plenty of time to get bigger and to start getting used to being out of a greenhouse. I got some mara des bois strawberries too… they will go in the ground either tonight or in the morning.

The afternoon was devoted to rest and repose. I slept all too briefly, dreams littered with voices and whispers from the past, pictures of the elders of Newtimber, of roaring fires, boiling pots, scalding swords and grinding mills.
Hand-clap games
Last week it really hit home. It happened at the barbers shop. The young woman cutting my hair began to describe me as beautiful. “You are a beautiful man” she kept saying “You have beautiful hair”. I just laughed nervously to myself and nodded and grinned and jokingly said “I cannot argue with you” I felt so very uncomfortable though and couldn’t wait to pay and get out of there. I did not like how vulnerable I felt. There have been other recent occasions too when people have described my voice as beautiful and my writing as beautiful and that I am beautiful and every time I felt deeply uncomfortable.
Aren't the colors just beautiful.
I believe this! Do you?
Oh, and Victoria and Kemel are also on Skaro. I don’t know if I mentioned that.
Here's the hard part. Pornography, fantasy, and masturbation go hand in hand. For males, you rarely have one without the other. So if a man tells you that he's addicted to pornography, it also means that he fantasizes and that he masturbates. It's gross to think about it, I know, but it's true.

I'm happy that Lovely E-Gallery sent me a replacement pair but at the end of the day, I think the shoes have poor craftmanship and I definitely would NOT pay almost $40 AUD for these quality of shoes. I'm probably better off finding an actual wholesale & manufacturing company to order my shoes from because the price will be closer to the quality I'm paying for. The shoes are comfortable though and I can't wait to wear them out :)

The aim of colonialism was eloquently expressed by the colonialist Cecil Rhodes:
Christ was ultimately gentle in His dealings with people. He certainly rebuked people, but it was always done in love and politeness “Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.” (Matt 11: 29). Remember “a gentle answer turns away wrath” (Prov 15:1).
Would it be any different if I opened a store and took my proceeds and spent it on a surgery? Is asking people to buy something from me so that I can get my surgery somehow lowering myself to beggar position?
Once you have firmed up the guest list and know who made the final cut and who didn’t you can tell people who aren’t on the list that you’ve decided on a small wedding. But don’t send out an email, only say something if someone asks you directly if they’re invited or not.

It's been a while since I've written in this space. 35 days to be exact. I didn't really intend to take such a long break, or even one at all. I can't even explain why I did. I just needed time away, I suppose. I've been contemplating a lot of things with my blog and shop. I haven't come to any conclusions, which isn't surprising, since I'm horribly indecisive.

Even those who praised him the most extravagantly had sometimes ‘no idea’, they thought they understood him but they did not; they either read into the poem much that was not there, or else missed much that was.

You'd do better to focus more on plot and less on character in this query. It's very very difficult to reduce complex motivations and situations to enticing descriptions for a query. You need to bat to your strengths, and plot may be better for that here.
I figure that by the time I get around to deciding what to fill the frames with, printing them, and actually re-hanging the frames, it will be closer to Summer than Spring! So, I am going with colors that would work for either season.
Simpson became one of the most influential Populist leaders, thanks in part to his extraordinary wit and talent for cagey publicity stunts. Running for the U.S. Congress in 1890, Simpson's opponents sarcastically accused the Populist candidate of being a backcountry rube who did not even wear socks. Simpson quickly turned the insult to his advantage, proudly calling himself "Sockless Jerry" or the "Sockless Socrates of the Plains." Simpson's down-home manner and humor won him wide support, and he served in Congress three times during the 1890s. Had he not been Canadian by birth, he would likely have been nominated as the Populist's presidential candidate.

Industry Structure and Concentration - anti-patent commentators previously alleged that, because of software patents, the software industry would become more concentrated over time. The idea was that strong patent protection over "backbone" software would tend to "lock in" a dominant product, and hence the company that owned it. However, this view ignores the dynamic sources of growth in the industry, and underestimates how real and effective this competition is in the fields where it operates. For every "backbone" product – such as an operating system program – there are many applications and ancillary products that connect to the backbone. For these products, ownership rights do not appear to create "lock-in" conditions on anything like the scale envisioned in the early 1990s:

After traumatizing my child with letting his baby corn snake escape, we of course had to soften the blow with the promise to fill the void and the tank with another creature. Our older son immediately knew that a Gecko was the way to go. Somehow, in the process of merely getting a look at our future resident one Saturday, we ended up taking home TWO Geckos. I didn’t even have time to make my disclaimer of how I wasn’t going to be the one feeding, watering and cleaning up after these two little dudes. Of course, if you know the Snakey Baken story, you know that I really had no room to give know-it-all advice or rules. It was too soon.

Totally a snacker's paradise! And it took like a total of like 15 seconds to do this, and the payoff is HUGE! First off, the kids don't need any assistance getting a snack, because they can now easily find what snacks are for them, and only eat good portions. Secondly, it actually takes up far less cabinet space than all of the boxes and packages would have. Win win!
Spring has sprung in a spluttering kind of fashion this year. Bright, sunny and warm one day. Wet, overcast and blustery the next. Yesterday exemplified that.

The festival is complemented by numerous other activities which in total provide the visitor with yet another excuse if one were ever needed to visit a city which grander than its size belies.

As much as I love having the bed to myself and whatnot, I do miss the fam. I won't see them until I get back to offshore. And I've just found out I may have screwed up some documentation, so this won't an easy next week or so. Well, if you don't do sh8t, you won't have sh8t to screw up. The wife is a great running buddy, but it's even better because I can make sweet love to her without being gay. She knows some her beer, has jumped into the beer world with me, and never fails to pick up maybe a couple six packs and bombers in a week at Specs. Although she does seem to like the dude that stocks the shelves at Specs. Well if it gets me free beer and gives me a pass to get with "Diamond" down at "the club" on occassion, I say let her flirt around with the dude. We're a pretty libertine family. But I look forward to getting back with her as the day I come back home, we are packing to hit the German Texas Hill Country for our anniversary. Busy day tomorrow... Have a good night.

Welcoming the partnership that Dr Shetty’s Naranyana Group have entered into with the Missouri-based US health care company, Ascension Health, he said that with the advent of this project Caymanians would have access to medical care at home instead of having to travel overseas.
The facts appear to be (according to John Campbell, who's got into very hot water indeed for daring to dispute the oracle) that Ken Ring said, after last year's September earthquake in Christchurch (which he unfortunately failed to predict - by any laws of evidence except those of a card-carrying Ringian), that he felt the aftershocks would tail off by the end of November. They didn't. He then explained that he didn't mean little aftershocks, which had tailed off by November (they hadn't), but only big earthquakes which caused harm to people and property, and that there was at least one of them still to come. I don't quite get how all that follows, but let's let it ride. That big one would strike on or about the 20th of March 2011.

Amiable but brainless buffoons in the blogosphere and media who advocate 'politics as a career' are advocating the democratic process as a road to enrichment and self-advancement; the big three parties have lost over 3m members since the 1950s, and now between them have fewer than 1% of the electorate as members. The Tories alone lost over a 1m members between 1979 and 1997 - when in government - as it disempowered local parties and drew power into a metropolitan elite clustered around Westminster, Whitehall and Victoria. A tame and drugged press became willing partners with the elites of the big three, swallowing press releases being much easier work than real journalism. The mandarins of Whitehall have done all they can to establish the dying parties as the permanent Parties of State, to lock a simulacrum of democratic process to the central command and control they've been unable and unwilling to abandon in peacetime. And above all the dark malignant shadow of the Berlaymont, an influence so baleful and evil that it crushes democracy, squeezes the very breath of freedom from the chests of its subject peoples, and makes Satraps of the compliant political class.

So we are getting into the category of tougher examples as far as free speech is concerned. This is no longer the mere (and yes, I say “mere!”) assertion that a popular religion is wrong. This is hate speech. Hate speech is, aside from a few exceptions, protected by the First Amendment. But the question for this blog post is, how far does that protection extend into public schools? How far should it extend?

Then, I woke up and seriously couldn't believe the way I felt...Okay, I know this is way TMI, but I have to tell you. I went to use the restroom and normally I have to maneuver my legs in a certain way (because my knees hurt so bad) to sit on the toilet and I have to use my hands and arms to help me too. Well, I went to pee (sorry again for the amount of info here) and I didn't have to do anything to help me sit down or get up from the toilet!!! I know that sounds ridiculous to most of you, but to me, it has been a daily struggle that I fight with every time I have to pee and with fibro, it increases the amount of times you have to go in a day so I'm spending most of my life in the bathroom. LOL I could get up and sit down --- without having to think about it! *breathes deeply* I just can't believe it. Thank you, everyone in my life who has been so supportive during my bad days which greatly outnumber my good ones. I had to share my day with you all because I know many of you have been praying and thinking of me and I wanted to ask you all to please keep doing it. It's working! It's working! Oh, thank you God!

So, anyway, I was sitting at the library because I can usually write in peace there. Suddenly this guy walked over and sat down right next to me. What the heck? There were like 40 empty chairs and he sat down right there! So, he looks at me, smiles, and starts reading his book. He read like maybe 5 sentences, then jumped up and walked over to the paperback racks. He put his book back and grabbed a different one, then came back and sat down again. He kept staring at me as he managed to read another 5 sentences or so. Then he did it again! He got up, put that book back and grabbed yet another one!
On the other hand, all the activity has made me appreciate my spare time a little more. My evenings being as full as the days.
OK, so what’s the rant about this time? Reviewers! What is wrong with these people? I’d been on this site for about 5 seconds and I ‘got it’ totally. It’s page 99, right? A random page, just plucked out of the middle-ish to give an overall flavour and a RANDOM excerpt of the author’s writing style. So you don’t review it as if it’s page 1, you don’t review it assuming it should tell you all you need to know about whichever character is present at the time, and you don’t review it as though the entire book is also like this one page!
So what does "eee" stand for?

Charmed! I only looked this up to double check, and I was right: Charmed’s 20th episode is Exit Strategy. Piper gets a new power! She’s my favorite part of the episode (and also my favorite character of the series). Unfortunately, this episode is part of a pretty boring two-parter. The A plot is Cole who has infiltrated the brotherhood. His relationship with Phoebe is also heavily focused. I don’t care for the A plot, simply because I know how tiresome Cole and Phoebe will get later on. I don’t think I watched Charmed’s 3rd season live. I was 11 when it aired, and I don’t think I was into drama shows at that time. I think I was still all about PBS Kids. Lol.

So today I offer as penance a shot of this delicious sandwich from the Eagle Rock Italian Deli. The bread was a real standout here, a spectacularly crunchy, brightly flavored traditional Italian hero loaf. Lettuce, tomato, provolone and mustard accompanied what I felt was just the right amount of salami, neither too much nor too little. Cheese, of course, is something with which I’ve also had issues. So between the lunch meat and the cheese it’s easy to see myself really disliking this sandwich. But it was really good. Nothing fancy, just very good. And besides, isn’t this how so many people know sandwiches? As a hoagie, or a hero, or a sub? Meat, honest or not, on bread, with cheese. There’s value in that, isn’t there? Certainly there are much greater heights, but…I don’t know. Maybe this was just such a strong example of the idea, or that I was eating it on a sunny, warm day, but I have no issue with it. I didn’t even mind the yellow mustard! It’s not so surprising, I suppose. The right Soprano or Tenor can sing an aria you’ve long grown bored with in such a way that it becomes fresh and new, and you see its beauty in a new light. And so it is with sandwiches, where good bread, good ingredients and a strong hand can take the mundane and work magic.

Surprisingly enough it was a paleo website that provided me with inspiration for a new recipe. I found a recipe for meatballs in a coconut sauce that sounded delicious - sort of. It needed a little TERP treatment to make it truly delicious, but once I knew what I wanted to do, a recipe came together.
Coming from a religious background, many of us.. no, most of us have heard the proverbial ‘salt-sermon’. It runs along the self-congratulating idea that Christians are a preservative on Earth.
It's just a neat idea that you can use for tons of other things besides your airplane luggage. You can use it for things like a day out at the zoo to tell the difference among your children's lunch pails, or what bags have the goodies and what has the extra pull ups, clothes and medicines, etc. The applications for things like this are really unending and extremely helpful.
I am proud to be an Australian, 3rd generation on my fathers side, we live in a lovely but terrifying at times country, and are very lucky to live where we live and not in many other places, we might have floods and fires but on the whole we are generous and I hope welcoming to those from other countries.
Or maybe just more time.

My daughter normally does her own hair, but when she asked for help brushing out some tenacious tangles, I was inspired to go beyond that and whip up something a little special.

Kudos to Lucy who introduced me to Bento Cafe. Their sushi is INCREDIBLE and I'm hungry just looking at the pictures. I'm totally going back there next time. It's always great to discover new Sushi places to try out. I had an amazing weekend with my friends and I'm so sad that it's all over but it just means that I have to organise regular weekends like this soon!

A witness gives testimony to what she has seen and heard. The early followers of Christ’s Way passionately showed and told what God had done for them, to them, and with them. And their words and lifestyle were contagious, starting spiritual fires everywhere they went.

I am no pollster and I did not sleep at a Holiday Inn Express last night, but it seems to me that if your man just fell 15 points in job approval in just 6 months, your prospects are dim and getting dimmer. But that is just me. And we are more than a year away. Maybe Obama pulls it off. Maybe Democrats pull off a 1972 and win a few of those seats back.
Those of you have read I Hate Myself and Want to Die know the book ends very abruptly. That book was written when I was 26, and dealt with matters that had happened in my early 20's. Now I'm 29, and think I can see the importance of words. Words can destroy as well as give hope. Words can hurt. Bottom line. I've written three books, I Hate Myself and Want to Die, was my first. Beautiful words is the title of my second book. Part memoir and part ficiton. The third book is called Wasted Beauty. As close to full fiction as I've come to. I'm not the main character.

Many coffee shops are now offering oatmeal with nuts (skip the sugar by using honey instead and save the dried fruit for later in the name of proper food combining: combining fruit and grain together can cause fermentation in the gut and bloating). Many menus don’t advertise the oatmeal or the honey, so you need to ask.
We're always delighted here at Eccentric Roadside when a community goes to great pains to save a classic roadside icon that could have just as easily been dumped in the eccentric roadside boneyard. Such is the case with Salty the Seahorse, who for years was much loved by the good folks of the pleasant south Massachusetts coast town of Mattapoisett. In the mid-1950s, a Mr. Henry Dunseith had his home and a gift shop on a plot of land on busy Route 6. To bring some attention to his business, he had a 38-foot seahorse erected on his land by a Mr. Theodore Tetreault. The seahorse became a beloved landmark of locals and tourists alike and when Mr. Dunseith passed away in 1988, he willed his 3 and a half acres of land, his buildings and the seahorse to the Mattapoisett Land Trust. The buildings were too dilapidated to restore and they were razed. The notion of doing away with the seahorse was considered, too, but local fans intervened and instead it got a makeover, to go along with the efforts of local garden club members, arborists and Boy Scouts who turned Mr. Dunseith's land into a beautiful playground, picnic area and nature area. The land is on the busiest intersection in town and a fortune could have been made by selling the land to a fast food chain or muffler shop, but the Land Trust stuck to Mr. Dunseith's wishes and a beautiful, quirky and unique park sits there today, reminding passers by of Mattapoisett's nostalgic tourist past (good on you, Land Trust). The park was dedicated in 2000 and a contest was held to name the seahorse-with-no-name (I think I've been through the desert on one of those). Salty was chosen and that's how he's known today (thank you, Gerry Rosser). An especially cool feature of the park are the remains of what must have been a mini-golf course, including a star-spangled buoy, wooden bridge and other loony-link hazards, now overtaken with grass, making it a nice, quirky homage to its retro road attraction past. Of course, you may want to take that with a grain of Salty.

Alongside the obvious, like document management, more businesses are finding that hosting a wiki in the cloud is an excellent way to encourage knowledge transfer. Wiki’s also provide an effective way to train up new recruits in a company’s particular style of service delivery. After all – entries in a wiki are created and improved over time, allowing processes and practices to change and develop in real time. Cloud based wikis mean your team can gen-up at any time and again, anywhere.
I decide to try some deep breathing exercises.
I have a busy life, with a ten year old daughter, whose mother lives at the other end of the country. Roughly one weekend in three is spent travelling to Edinburgh and back, which means the rest of my life is squeezed into a smaller space.
It’s the most wonderful time of the year!
I wouldn’t necessarily say that I’m intimidated by pastry dough, but it is my least favorite kind of baking. Especially when it comes to all of the flour, rolling it out, the chilling, or the rising – ugh. I just don’t have the patience. Of course I always love the end result and it’s usually worth it. These little gems were the exception in that there was no fuss and no muss. Just some milk, butter, flour, and eggs. Well, a little sugar and salt too.
This always takes quite awhile but is a fun challenge. At this point, after only finding the letters R, R, and C--

Geert Hofstede describes culture as the “collective programming of the mind, which distinguishes the member of one group or category of people from those of another.” People carry “mental programs” which are developed in the family in early childhood and reinforced in schools and organizations, and that these programs contain components of national culture. They are expressed most clearly in the different values that predominate among people from different countries.
I wasn't going to go to London Fashion Week this season, honest I wasn't. When Pearl text me to ask what days I was doing, I text back a big fat "None"! I had a couple of show tickets which included Antoni and Alison and Corrie Neilson which I was going to give to my daughter anyway as even if you don't stay at a hotel in London, it still costs a fortune in train fares, food and Starbucks which is an absolute necessity (when you have been up since 5am to get ready, get to London, then tube it across to Somerset House to make a 9 am show) so it all hardly seemed worth it to be honest, I was thinking of buying a new pair of shoes with the money, then my plans began to change and my "fashion adrenaline" kicked in!
Reading in Colossians for today’s #Word360 reading reminded me of the power of the cross. At Manna Church, we are going through a series on Religion and examining the damaging effects of losing our focus on the cross and Jesus as our only hope for not only salvation, but the ability to walk daily with Him.
This book is exquisitely written and will definitely appeal to lovers of the fantasy genre. I also think it has crossover appeal for adults as well as teens. The intriguing ending has left me in great anticipation of the next book in the trilogy which will hopefully be out next year.
Even though I’m going to be in Edinburgh until September 2012, I just finished my classes at ELTC. I have a mix of emotions because of that. I feel happy because I could improve my English a little bit, but also I feel sad because I’m going to miss my classes, my teachers and my friends. However, in the end I’m glad because I met a lot of interesting people and I’ll try to keep in touch with them.

Let me just say, it meant the world to me that Pam reached out in this way and wanted to talk to me about this. She cared enough to ask the questions. In fact, when we got together tonight, she had a list of questions for me. I felt so loved tonight as I talked and answered her questions. She cared enough to wonder how I felt then, when Zach was born, and then to ask how I felt now. The funny thing is Pam wondered if she had been a good friend to me...and yet she is someone who stands out in my mind as one who has gone the extra mile to care for me and to care for my family over these past three and a half years. She spent a year or more, before she had some changes in her schedule, spending time with Zach on a weekly basis, because she "did not want Zach to grow up and not know who she was." I am blessed to have a friend like this!

Now, for those attempting to be obedient to Christ’s teaching, look at Matthew 25:31-46 (pick the version of your choice!) Often, segments of this “teaching” are taken out of context, but here, you can read the entire section. The essence of this does NOT say that the government should take care of those in need, does it? NO! He challenges the individual believer, the individual citizen to help as he is able, not for the headlines, not for some gratuity, but out of COMPASSION.

This cake has quite a few components, it has two layers of chocolate sponge, mango mousse, chocolate mousse, a thin layer of feuilletine, clear glaze, and of course the macarons. The macarons are filled with mango buttercream, except the side decoration. It took quite a bit of time to make each one but once you've got it all, it's relatively easy to assemble. I took a shortcut and used my last batch of instant chocolate mousse though, it was Alaska-Express chocolate mousse mix just because I have enough leftover to make one 8" layer (will have to make it from scratch next time), everything else was pretty straight forward too.

Let me share something with you.
My invisible illness is endometriosis. Endo is hard to talk about without mentioning unmentionables. Men who are faint of heart might want to skip to the next paragraph. When I explain endo, I have to use words like “uterus” and “ovaries” and that tends to freak people out. And hey, I can admit it, endo is gross. I’m certainly not a fan. But moving on, I have a little story to share.
And back to Barry.

But Malkin, in her race-political cowardice, has turned back the clock on knowledge of Katrina! She refers to the dead as having died from Katrina: “those who died in the natural disaster.” How does she propose that people on land that remained dry died in a flood?
If anything can be redeemed from the afternoon, it was that I learnt what a gorgeous class Betty is in. There are only seven of them (two girls and five boys) and when they weren't helpfully offering me their critique, they all sat around getting on incredibly well with each other and gossiping like little old ladies. It was very touching indeed.

Jami: That's hard to answer. I guess I can see that Jim and I have come closer together. I've learned who I can trust and lean on, and I have a deeper understanding of trusting my Savior. I wish my story was one where I went years and years of not getting pregnant and then all of the sudden I find out I'm pregnant... music swells... we make excited phone calls... we kiss passionately... happily ever after. I know this is not what my Lord has planned. I know infertility was not His original plan for this world, but we all tasted the fruit. We all nailed Him to the tree. This is my part in the brokenness. His suffering is my suffering. For Him I can endure.
After the hearing, our case worker gave her a gift from us: a necklace with a diamond heart pendant. Diamonds are Spencer's birthstone. In the card from us, she read that she will always be a part of the heart of our family and she'll always be our hero. We'd love to have continued contact with her, but we understand that she needs space to heal and prefers just to receive letters and pictures for now. We let her know that we are always available if she would like to have more contact in the future.

As they did so, the moon continued to rise and I observed the shadows move and change across her own bright, cratered face. I saw the chinese rabbit in her there – the one which honors fertility and abundance. I saw a blue aura (probably the reflective effect of my glasses) surrounding her entire orb. I saw her climbing ever higher into the cosmos. I watched her and listened to the simple humanity unfolding under her radiant influence upon the grasses and dirt of our earth, in the dark, filling the night air with the song of fire and instruments and voices. It was lovely to be allowed my own place in the dark and to turn my attention back and forth between the celestial and terrestrial events unfolding just as they should. As above, so below. As within, so without.
Good news! I only had to make the Smoked Mackerel Pate and combine others efforts into the terrine!! Oh yes, and make the coulis, pickle and Melba toast. The terrine had to rest between the addition of each layer and would take all morning if not longer. To add to the fun the boats were late back into Ballycotton and both Shrimp and Crab were on the boat. By the time that they had cooked, cooled and been processed into the relevant pates, and cooled again the prospects of Fish Terrine as a starter for lunch were minimal at best and heading for the horizon like an amphetamine fueled antelope.

The drive home was brutal. My rib hurt and I started to feel achy and I had the chills. It felt like I had the flu all of a sudden! Chris wasn't home and it took a long time for me to get the girls in and settled. When he did get home I went straight to bed and just hung out there the rest of the night. In addition to my meds I took Tylenol with codeine. It helped get me to sleep :) This morning I feel better (except my rib still hurts and I get very winded just walking and talking.) Should make for an interesting day of teaching. Ugh.

The state of New York is allowing the installation of security cameras and a GPS device in all state vans, cars, and buses which transport the developmentally disabled in Albany and the surrounding area. If the program goes well, officials plan to push to make this a statewide initiative. State commissioner of the NY Office of People With Developmental Disabilities Courtney Burke said this program will ensure the safety of any individual being transported by one of their vehicles, while protecting the driver against false reports of abuse, helping to resolve situations that might otherwise spiral out of control and end up ruining the life of a falsely accused employee.
Hey what’s this book? The Bagava-what?
Born on August 17, 1988, and brought up in Cork, where his parents are both teachers, Aidan Coleman learned his trade on the Irish pony racing circuit, where he had over 100 winners. “It’s brilliant and you learn to deal with the nerves too,” he said, “There was a lot of betting and the owners always wanted them to win. I was 12 or 13 and had one owner who always told me how many grand he had on his horse, but I never let it get to me. I still don’t.” Although his brother, Kevin, had become a jockey in Ireland and was doing well (so well, in fact that in August, 2007 he won the Galway Plate on Sir Frederick), Aidan opted instead to work in England. Through Irish trainer John Murphy, Coleman got a place at Henrietta Knight’s yard, and it was her horse Silverbar that provided the young jockey with his first ride under Rules on December 23, 2006, at Hereford. At the end of the 2006/07 season, Coleman moved to Venetia Williams’ stable at King’s Caple and his first winner arrived in the shape of Tashkandi, who was successful in a selling hurdle at Uttoxeter in October, 2007. That victory put him on the fast track to success. In 2009, he partnered his first Cheltenham Festival winner when Kayf Aramis won the Pertemps Final. Coleman won on his first ride at Aintree as he partnered Stan to capture the matalan.co.uk Red Rum Handicap Chase and he rode the same horse in the following year’s John Smith’s Grand National, thus missing out on winning ride on Mom Mome. Coleman, who writes a blog for the Racing UK website, has already won over the National fences this season, having ridden Stewarts House to success in the Betfred Grand Sefton Handicap Chase in December. John Smith’s Grand National Record: 2008 Mon Mome (10th); 2009 Stan (Fell 7th); 2010 Mon Mome (Fell 26th); 2011 Grand Slam Hero (Fell 13th)

If you are currently in Il wishing to find some quick and momentary financial Loans, it is recommended take an Il cash advance Loan. In other words, this is called a temporary financial Loan, this means credit that’s going to endure right until your next cash advance or maybe the quality is often extended until the subsequent payday. It is otherwise known as typical almost financial Loan once the credit standing is just not thought about. This can be a bonus to those with poor credit who, evidently, are unable to receive credit rating effortlessly or may not be thought to be to borrow by any means.

This was what she'd been training for her whole life. Up at 5 AM, then school, then more training. Never like the other kids, always working twice as hard, no time for video games or television. But she'd wanted it, wanted it like when you find something elemental in your being and know it belongs to you to shape and mold and let flourish. She was meant to be an Olympian. So what if this whole thing was a little, well, unusual? She trusted her father - trusted him completely. If he said this place was safe, then it was. And of course they would follow the rules.

I went into the breakroom today and did what I always do, pour the soup powder into a bowl and add some cold water to whisk it before adding hot. But the soup powder was brown!! At first I thought, did it go bad? Then I thought, maybe they just forgot to add the red food coloring! (It’s the tomato soup.) Then I gave it the sniff test. What the heck, it smelled like chocolate!

All supplies are CTMH. The scalloped circle was cut using the Art Philosophy Cricut cartridge (1.75" for the white, 2" for the Cocoa) and stamped with the "Connections" set (D1330). I stamped the sentiment using "Say it in Style" (D1283). Colors used are white, Juniper and Cocoa. In order to remember what size I used when I stamped the circle, I wrote it with a Sharpie directly on my carrier sheet. Many of the sets released prior to the Art Philosophy cartridge can be used in conjunction with it, so I'm trying to make sure I update each carrier sheet as I go along.
There is a lot of anger in my heart right now. After months of waiting & wondering, feeling any number of emotions from guilt to self-blame and beyond, I finally got closure the other day in the break-up of a friendship. While there may not have been an actual explanation, it was a response, and one I needed. I had given myself permission a few weeks ago to feel angry about this, and immediately felt relief. This response just proved to me how right I was, and how much better off I will be in my life without that particular friendship. But, it still hurts. A lot.

There has tended to arise the idea, from Leninism, and more particularly Luxemburgism, that the creation of Trades Unions is a symbol of the fact that the working class is a revolutionary class, whose conditions of life spontaneously generates a class consciousness, and that it is this class consciousness and the automatically arising collective and solidaristic organisation, which is the basis and form through which the new forms of property under Socialism are established. But, a reading of the programme set out here shows that conception is false.

Take a second to think about writers you know, like the critique partner who works with you to improve your manuscript. The writing friend who listens, supports and keeps you strong when times are tough. The author who generously offers council, advice and inspiration when asked.
As the season draws on, Mitchell's aura of coolness is replaced by the stench of desperation, and the acts he becomes willing to commit in order to save himself grow more and more off-putting. When George and Nina befriend McNair and Tom, father and son werewolves, Mitchell fixates on the older man, who has a chip on his shoulder about vampires, as his potential killer, and sells him to local vampires as the star attraction in a lethal circus act. When Herrick, brought back to life at the end of the second season, shows up on the family's doorstep with no memory of who or what he is, Mitchell becomes obsessed with learning the secret of his resurrection, to which end he tortures Herrick, and very nearly feeds him an innocent woman.
Kumi Naidoo of Greenpeace International wisely summed up two key forces of change in the world: "The creation of a middle class in developing economies simultaneous with the destruction of the middle class in developed economies."

The truth is that some day - some how - some form you will see my name in the list of inspirational cookbooks based off of some successful bakery adventure. Some day. Hundreds of pounds of butter and millions of pounds of flour later I might be there. Don't tell but I already have a name picked out.
This is so true..although his family thought they were acting in his best interest and in love..they were in fact infringing on this mans rights..an older man who simply wanted to enjoy himself regardless..simple really..we can be so selfish sometimes.

"We have not talked about the revenue that the state has lost because farms totalling 5.9 million hectares, which were active and accruing revenue for the state, were handed over to the people. And more than 90% of those farms are now not functional. They are not productive, and the state loses revenue. We cannot afford to go on like that," he said. Nkwinti said the "proposed reform of the land tenure system would address both the foreign land ownership question and the status of the government when it pumps new money into land owned by failing farmers." he ANC still will continue to try and shift 82million hectares of 'formerly white-owned land' to blacks by 2014 although he believed it was an 'unrealistic target'. They would now be focusing, he said, "on reviving the development of a 'sustainable emerging black farming' community." http://www.timeslive.co.za/local/article334448.ece

The first one, with the Vampire Dennis image, was, I think my second or third Beano cover, and, as I sometimes did, I had drawn it and coloured it and was just about to cram it into a postal tube when I decided I could improve it. This is that 'improved' cover, but The Beano were sent both and chose one.
The girls are enjoying a lazy Saturday morning, and they are getting along perfectly. I made heart shaped waffles and we had a nice breakfast together. I need to do a little tidying around the house, but that's about it. I'll have a short run on the treadmill later, which will put me at somewhere around 36 miles for the week, and I'm very pleased to see some improvement in my fitness and mileage this month.

The only biological grandfather I'd known, I lost in elementary school. But I always had Papa Jack. He wasn't my biological grandfather, but he was my grandfather just the same. We celebrated holidays with him and Mama Jack. We learned to swim in their pool and spent most days of the summer there. Papa Jack and Mama Jack bought me my first (and only) cabbage patch doll. My first bike. The watch I really wanted, even though my sister told me it was a stupid gift to ask for for Christmas. They took care of us. They made sure we had enough. Enough gifts at Christmas, Easter baskets on Easter Sunday (I remember asking my mom one year, "How does the Easter Bunny always know to take our baskets there?"), enough love. Always enough love.
That is the nature of the great Beast of our times. It can be defeated and put back to sleep. Its modern prestige and especially the power of the Sunni and Shi-ite fundamentalists in Saudi Arabia and Iran is based on one thing. It certainly isn’t military prowess, as the American, British and Israeli machines have all shown over and over again. Nor is it about guerrilla warfare successes of the kind seen in Afghanistan and Lebanon, which may yet emerge in Gaza.

Loop 1 - 12 miles - Christina, Samantha, and Robin D joined me. This was the longest of the loops and things were feeling nice and easy. The 30 degree temps actually felt nice - like having my hips and knees iced while we ran. We stayed right on pace. At the end of the loop, I took a quick break at the car for food and to change to a lighter top.

I’m turning 30 tomorrow. It’s the kind of age that brings up a lot of questions. Were my 20s spent wisely? Am I where I expected to be at this age? Why, after 90,000 days on this planet, do I still suck at buying bras? (Has Oprah taught me NOTHING?)
Please take the time to read the information on her site, if you are not already familiar with this book. Then if you are outraged, there is something you can do! Here is the facebook page of the petition to Amazon asking them to stop selling this book. Here is the petition itself. And the blog of the woman who started the petition. The purpose of the petition is to pressure Amazon to stop selling the book (and other similar books), so that it will not be so readily available to parents who are desperately seeking godly answers and might fall into this very ungodly trap. Hopefully, it will also encourage them to look into WHY they can't find the book easily, and perhaps they will stumble across better information in the process.

The last mile of the path in the adjoining county (Davis), thus between the end of the new highway and the Salt Lake county line, was built by Chevron. A couple of years ago Chevron had a pipe leading to the refinery here burst in a very prestigious neighborhood and spill its oil into the prettiest and most private of the streams flowing into the Salt Lake Valley. In fact it is so pristine that there is no public access to canyon it flows down Lower down however, but still in the foothills, the stream flows through the property of a lot of rich people. While we would never get rid of Chevron, we gladly accepted their mitigation money and were happy to let them build this mile of path. You should see their contribution to the Utah Symphony. Most of the spilled oil ended up in the Jordan River, as does all the water that enters the valley from the five canyons that surround it, so most of the cleanup took place along the river. The bog in the picture with the beautiful new bridge is still pretty oily.

“The common themes raised from tenants were that they were experiencing draughts through windows and doors, fuel bills were too high and issues around condensation, damp and mould. Quite often they have not opened windows or turned extractors on whilst washing or cooking, and no fresh air is getting in. The majority of the properties were found to have background ventilation such as trickle ventilators fitted to UPVC window frames and air bricks but they were sealed or blocked up by tenants, which means moist/damp air cannot escape.

It is no coincidence that the FDA Chairman who stood in the way of aspartame’s approval was removed from office the day Ronald Reagan took office. His replacement (Dr. Arthur Hill Hayes) was in part planted there by Donald Rumsfeld, CEO of G.D. Searle (aspartame is produced by G.D. Searle Company), in order to allegedly get a friendly rubber stamp on aspartame’s approval.

I don’t think this was a comfortable waiting either. They must have been constantly questioning themselves. Is that it? Was he really who he said he was?

My sister and I boarded the plane to leave Argentina on June 24th, 1994. I had just graduated from high school and this was my first time to travel without an adult - and I had my kid sister in tow, headed halfway around the planet while my parents stayed behind to pack up our stuff. I remember the date so specifically because we woke up on the plane on June 25th - my sister’s 13th birthday. I asked the flight attendant if there was something special she could do for my sister. I was hoping they might have a nice muffin or an extra dessert. She suggested I buy her something out of the SkyMall magazine. To this day I marvel at how that lady just didn’t “get it.”

It was perfect when you were together. You jelled well, you understood each other, you were head over heels in love. You were almost there, on the threshold of the alter, till one of you baulked. And things were never the same again. It may have happened that one of you thought things were going too fast, while the other was antagonized by the commitment issues of the former. Slowly and steadily the whole thing deteriorates into a ruinous bit of daily infighting and the couple break up. But the further apart you are from your ex, the more you want to get your ex back, because somewhere down, you know that your ex was the perfect person for you. So what to say to get your ex back? Here are some get your ex back tips to help you win your love back.

You remember the Matrix, when they could tell there was a glitch in the system because a scene would repeat itself (the black cat and deja vu moment)? Well, kind of on the same line of thought, we knew we were being followed by ghosts because the rhythm of our steps would align with the rhythm of the tune that nearby birds were singing. Or something really incredibly ridiculous like that.

Having a beautiful body shape is a kind of dream for every people in the world. With a beautiful body, you will be able to walk or stand in front of people very confidently. Besides, your body shape is one of the most important aspects of maintaining your relationship with your beloved couple. You absolutely want to attract your couple’s attention by showing him your beautiful body. It really means something for your life, isn’t it? However, you should remember that nobody’s perfect. You may have some unexpected condition of some parts of your body because of some reasons. You may have it because of a natural condition since you were born or some moments that happen in your life. Some moments may change your beautiful body to be far from proportional. If you think that you need a plastic surgery, you must read this.
I don't know if Nas is a fan of the Iliad, which describes Hypnos (who personifies sleep in Greek mythology) and Thanatos (who personifies death) as twin brothers. I think Nas's description of sleep and death as cousins is more apt than Homer's description of them as twins -- sleep and death share certain characteristics, but are quite different. (The Jewish Talmud says that sleep is 1/60th part of death -- more like cousins than twin brothers, in other words.)

And I don't care if you do or don't like politics/like Ronald Reagan/whatever...if you read this book, and you have a heart, you'll LOVE reading the letters inside. I had no idea that Reagan was such a sentimental, doting, smitten man. I remember when Reagan died, I was sitting there, watching the funeral on tv, and saw Nancy Reagan looking like she didn't want to leave him there (and I believe she even said something outloud along those lines)...and I truly felt for her. I mean I wanted to cry for her. (~And I'm not usually like that.) I wish I would have read this book before Reagan died... I don't know how to explain it any more than that, other than to be redundant and say that this is a really touching book.

The series that you see today is probably about the 18th version of what I originally started out with. As the series has developed I hope that it has given people the chance to experience Doctor Who in a slightly different way. I wanted to put my own slant on it and so I wrote in my own version of the Eleventh Doctor. This was a Doctor that I could shape and not have to worry about what was happening in the real ‘canon’ of the television series. Obviously I try and stay as close as possible but it gives me more freedom to play about with the Doctor, and more obviously the interior of the TARDIS.

Four weeks on and the machine is functioning perfectly with absolutely no issues whatsoever. Assuming this continues to be the case, my conlusion would be that depending on how much was paid to purchase the Inspiron, it is either an excellent machine for the price or you could have bought better. All in all, I am very please with it although I have already ordered a new power supply in anticipation of the original failing within a few months. As the dell software seems to be the cause of problems with the touchpad, webcam, etc, I would recommend a clean install of the operating system without the dell software. This is not a straightforward task as their is no system disk, although a system image is included on the drivers disk and you would have to be capable of altering the answer file to load the image without the dell software. It is easier to install from a genuine disk and update the product key on the Microsoft website. The product key is located in the battery compartment.

From the first times I watched Gettysburg and Gods and Generals, until now, the one performance that always stood out to me was Brian Mallon as General Winfield Scott Hancock, commander of the United States Army’s first division during the American Civil War, and a General present at major battles such as Fredericksburg, Antietam, and Gettysburg. With two films loaded with star power, I wanted to delve deeper into the supporting cast, and that is where I came across Mallon, who is a veteran actor of both film and theater here in the US, as well as England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland. Other than the two films mentioned above, he has appeared in Some Mother’s Son, The Informant, and Gangs of New York, among others.

Mad!?!? So why would she say these words? I know she is at the age that I dreaded coming to, ” I hate you”, “you don’t understand me,” but when did ” I want to die” become part of the deal? So asked I her why did she think this was Okay to say, or where has she heard this before? And to my amazement she told me that she had a friend in school who apparently uses the line of ” I want to kill myself,” quite a bit. Amongst her friends it used on a regular basis. What concerned me the most was the one friend who says it often. Of course as any concerned parent, I have advised the school counselor and in particular about this one little girl.
Happiness is an important concept for Nietzsche, as it was for Aristotle. Nietzsche draws a distinction between the happiness of the masters and aristocrats, which is active and comes from within. They don’t draw happiness from looking at their enemies but from their own actions. He draws a link here between the Classical Greek terms for happiness and ‘to do well’. Happiness for Nietzsche, as for Aristotle, requires action. Nietzsche believes that the slaves do not share this view. The “happiness” of the weak and oppressed is “narcotic”. It is quiet, peace, relaxation… it is purely passive, rather than the active happiness of the masters.

But it wasn’t until Saturday that I paused to reflect and see that God is answering and has answered this prayer multiple times over.

Once again, it may not be fair to lump undead in with forsaken, and since this is ICC, I can see that these goons might have been more under Arthas’s sway than they were in Naxx (which initially existed before even the Burning Crusade, before Arthas was really relevant in WoW). For instance, I would hardly count Saurfang as having free will, but what about Arthas himself? Being exceptionally generous, we’ll only chalk Arthas up to being an undead raid boss in here, because otherwise the whole place would count against the undead (10 if we count them all, though only Saurfang and Arthas are really “humanoid”).
So, as you can see once again, there is no contradiction in these passages. My question is, “how do you know what God’s will is so that you can obey it?” The answer is found in the Word of God. These are the words of Jesus Christ Himself.
The reporters and bloggers writing 'articles' on Trayvon Martin's 'records' should be ashamed of themselves. Those things are not news, they are inflammatory to the highest degree and completely irrelevant to the fact that he was shot to death walking down the street. It has no bearing what so ever on our laws, Trayvon's right as a human being in America to walk down the street without bodily harm, the proceedings after his death- none of it changes in any way because of anything Trayvon did in his seventeen years of life. Damnit, people, stop writing this drivel. It's embarrassing, like we are children passing rumors in the hallway about how slutty X looked the night she was raped. TALK ABOUT THE MURDER OF A CHILD. Stop talking about if he smoked pot, sold pot, was late too school too much- HE WAS MURDERED. Talk about that. Put your big girl/boy panties on and talk around the grown up table. Leave the ( completely normal/common/unremarkable ) things Trayvon did behind. It's not about what he did. He can't do anything now. He's dead because a grown man shot him and walked away and went home and sat his ass down and we are letting him.

In the solution of disciplinary and certain promotional disputes, Civil Service Law may also play a role. Civil Service Law supersedes the arbitrator’s award. I believe it is the same case with teacher’s tenure although I am not familiar with tenure rules.

I left teaching in May 2009 to pursue writing full-time. Risky? You bet. Leaving a steady job in the hope of securing publication -- it's a long shot. But by October I’d signed with my agent, Michelle Humphrey. Five months later, my novel-in-verse, MAY B., sold at auction. While this all sounds easy, my publication journey has been anything but.
No matter how nervous I might have gotten before a performance, never was I as terrified or intimidated as I am sending out e-mails to my favorite authors asking them to read my work. I agonize over every word when I send out my request worried that I have gushed too much or haven’t been glowing enough about their work. More often than not I assumed the writer I am querying won’t have the time to read my stuff. I mean, we all have deadlines. Big name writers have BIG deadlines. They don’t have lots of time to spend on reading other people’s manuscripts.
I have a few crochet projects that I'm working on, no really good photos right now so I'll hold off on posting the pictures until next time.

development of nine homes, we had moved to an area of smaller farms with two barns, chicken coups a second small house , a dog run and two large fenced fields for the horses that we had to look after. We had this very neat riding gas powered lawn mower that I would use to cut the front and back lawn. My first drive of anything powered other than with my feet or legs. The front lawn had a bit of a slope to it and this is were I did my first "power slide" , spinning the rear wheels with full power going up the slope at a slight angle so that the rear wheels would spin wildly. After I discovered that , the summer lawn mowing was way more "fun". many years later when my mom decided to sell the family home, I wanted to buy it but since we had not long before moved to our new Lambeth Drive home it seemed to be too much to ask of my family to

When I accepted the job at the AICPA, I canceled an interview with a Mid-Atlantic Gannett newspaper for a copy editing job that would have paid better. I had just been laid off and was very paranoid about joining another chain, particularly that one. A few months later, I found out that the person who would have interviewed me had been laid off.
Jericho returns on-screen only to be confronted by Alex Riley backstage. Riley told Chris that he spotted CM Punk drinking in his locker room backstage. Jericho seemed skeptical at first, but Riley said he would show him. And lo and behold, Punk was seen drinking a bottle of alcohol. Jericho was dumbfounded at what he just witnessed, as was Alex Riley. Later on in the night, because of what he witnessed, Jericho decided to see Laurinaitis to demand a few things. Jericho implored Laurinaitis to vacate the title because of Punk drinking on the job. Laurinaitis agreed with Jericho and told Jericho that a sobriety test would be set up in the ring later in the night to see if Punk was really drunk or not. If Punk was indeed as drunk as Jericho had claimed, Punk would be stripped from the title and would have to hand it over to Jericho immediately.
There are over 100 authentic recipes, with tons of tips throughout. I was pretty surprised by everything I learned by reading through this book. First of all, I never knew the Caribbean had such a strong Indian influence. This book has a ton of delicious curries, stews, and rotis. I immediately gravitated towards those because I have a major love for Indian cuisine.
End of day, I came back home, with some cartoon tattoos and stamps on my wrist, some flowers which she picked and some gifts from their trip to India, wonderful evening it was.

Doubt must be cast on the current emphasis on exploiting large quantities of natural resources and capital at the expense of efficiency. It is inadvisable to keep relying on natural resources, renewable or otherwise, as a means of earning foreign currencies and fostering growth. If anything, the current growth strategy has given rise to a big group of low-income people, who struggle just to make ends meet.

“You haven’t known me long enough,” Carmen said and peered back over her shoulder again. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she was being watched. She looked back at the park. Maybe the giraffe was staring at her whilst grazing back behind the fence he and his friend had disappeared through. A cold, tiny shiver ran through her body barely penetrating her tough facade, what she did notice of it she just chalked up to being infuriated by the giraffe’s remarks.

“I wasn’t always abnormal. In fact, in 1997, I was the picture of social normalcy. Repuplicans would’ve been proud of me. It was 1997 of course that my one man band Disorderly Cows enjoyed our(my) short-lived but inspirational and highly influential career. I created an awful form of music that I called Moo Grind. Armed with a shitty guitar with two broken strings, a horrid guitar amp and pedal, a kazoo, and my lovely voice, I unleashed the cassette “Bovine Intervention” upon the world. Mixing serious songs, like the introspective “Pain Factor Denied” and “Serene Brutality” with an anthem-esque punkish tune “Oppressed Working Class”, the real life day-to-day tales of cowmanship “Sit At Leo’s and Rot” and “Bovine Intervention”, the fuck-you-I’m-gonna-rock-somewhat “Fucking Docile”, “Moo Grind (Fuck You I’m Disorderly)” and “Immolate Me Baby”, and of course the Spice Girls cover “Wannabe”, I was pretty sure I was onto something huge. Most likely I was ON something huge though, no doubt my favorite things that year were Jack Daniel’s and LSD. The cover of the album was a poorly hand drawn parody of Exhorder’s “Slaughter In The Vatican” album. Are there slaughterhouses in Vatican City? I don’t fuckin’ know. I do know that if the world heard the music that was on this cassette, I’d probably be committed… or commended, definitely one or the other.”
To roast your pumpkin cut your pumpkin in half...right down the middle...side to side of "the belly" area as my daughter calls it, so the top is intact and the bottom is intact. Place face down on a parchment or foil lined baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for about 35-40 minutes (it depends on the size of pumpkin used).

I'm sitting here in the Prez Club of Continental enjoying some "complimentary" Heineken. I'm supposed to be prepping for a couple of workshops at which I'll be speaking tomorrow on the Energy sector. The first one is pure energy technology with only myself as the speaker, right up my ally. The second one is a panel discussion with high level Oil & Gas Execs. At first I was told that it did not really have to be execs, and NSBE told me so late about the panel that I doubted in this capital crunch world we live in that I could scare up one of our company execs to fly out to Tulsa for this thing, so I volunteered myself. As long as they keep it technical, I'll run those other dudes out of the room. If they delve into Professional development and hiring, then I'm gonna look like Mos Def when he's a panelist on Real Time with Bill Maher.

Look at how we can tell that the top of the apple has ridges because of how the light hits those spots first. It then fades from there down to the deepest shadows at the base of the apple. The shadow on the ground is the same way. It is lightest on the edges where the Sun still can reach it, then fades into deeper shadow immediately under the apple. From above you can't see the shadow on the ground- the apple is blocking the shadow.

Crafty they are, no longer overt in intent, today they craft their evil guised as compassion, today the good fall in knowing nothing, today the nationalist is wholly contested whilst the true and indeed vast evil struts across the worlds stage. So clever, little by little, piece by piece until suddenly it is done, until it is too late and freedom goes wanting, today no red tanks, no known gulag, merely the slow and steady creep towards it. Political correctness by its very definition is authoritarian, those that love the people, the nation portrayed as its attackers and those that would see it gone its defenders, topsy turvey dystopia, a land on its head.

The horizontally integrated chain in operating a number of outlets is going for a wider mainstream customer base. It can be observed the product choices in these establishments favour national brands and lack imagination. Many beer geeks would like to see a legal right to procure beers off the national list. The reason many of these chains prefer national procurement is often stated as obtaining the economies of bulk purchasing but there is another reason entirely and that is one of preventing corruption. A chain of over a thousand operators procuring product individually affords many opportunities for back handers. The operator buys product on the books and the supplier gifts the operator off the books. National procurement with a managed supply chain keeps everything on the books but favours suppliers that supply nationally. The most successful of these chains appears to be Wetherspoons with a managed house model and focus of delivering quality at reasonable prices to the end customer. They are not the only one; Crown Carveries appear to do a roaring trade as do many others you can mention. Those chains that attempt to be actual restaurants rather than pub themed restaurants even make a go of a pricier offering.

The next town was Ankola and I could try getting a place to sleep there, I thought. So I rode easy for some time, stopping often to take in the scenery. From the tops of most of the uphills, you get a good view of the sea, mostly mongroove and the water coming in in a network of broad interconnected channels. The traffic on the highway wasn’t too bad, the trucks were far better behaved than I’d expected. In fact loaded trucks and tractors moved at about the same speed as me, especially on the uphills. The worst are the buses, speeding and overtaking like insane. It’s really bad in parts where the highway is not four-laned, then the vehicles coming from the opposite side push you off the road in their bid to overtake. And buses take forever to overtake, driving alongside whatever they’re overtaking, taking up the whole road. Initially I’d just stay on as long as a I could and then quickly get off the road, making loud what-the-fuck gestures at the bus with my hand. This is until I saw this one bus driver actually looking at me gesturing with his chin for me to get off the road while he maneuvered the steering with both his hands. The problem with me is that more often than not I start to see the other person’s point of view, like the bus driver must’ve been having a tough time overtaking on the uphill or something of that sort, and then it’s hard to stay angry. Anyway, the realisation that I could directly talk to the drivers brought about a change of tactics. By the third day I was gesturing wildly to any potentially hazardous overtakers to stay in their lane. Big hand waves, before pulling off the road sometimes, as they came at me anyway; but in some of the cases it did work.
and staying.

I am of the opinion that college sports, and to a lesser extent high school sports, offer small academic benefits and cause more problems than their worth. I think it would be interesting to ask our big universities to open their books and demonstrate where all the money goes and prove how it benefits the academics of the institution. It won’t happen, because we have neither the political courage among our representatives, nor the interest from the zombie fans to do anything.

Think about the people in films and magazines and on the internet who pose naked. They are appealing to the sin of lust. There is a market for it. People are lustful – they want to see that kind of thing. But people aren’t naturally inclined to go around naked. The world entices them into doing it to make money. Then a cult develops – you are “told” that attractive people get famous by doing it, so, if you are attractive, people will really like you if you do it, too, or, if that’s too much for you, then the world tells you that it is alright to at least act promiscuously for the same purpose.

Besides the U.S. Chamber, there are thousands of state and local chambers of commerce and trade associations also engaged in public relations and lobbying activities. The corporate and trade-association lobbying network community is “a network of well over I50,000 professionals,” and its resources are related to corporate income, profits, and the protective value of public-relations and lobbying outlays. Corporate profits before taxes in I985 were $295.5 billion. When the corporate community gets agitated about the political environment, as it did in the I970s, it obviously has the wherewithal to meet the perceived threat. Corporate and trade-association image and issues advertising increased from $305 million in I975 to $650 million in I980. So did direct-mail campaigns through dividend and other mail stuffers, the distribution of educational films, booklets and pamphlets, and outlays on initiatives and referendums, lobbying, and political and think-tank contributions. Aggregate corporate and trade-association political advertising and grass-roots outlays were estimated to have reached the billion-dollar-a-year level by I978, and to have grown to $I.6 billion by I984.

His root problem with Liberalism (and neoliberals) seems to be that he considers it a utopian, legalistic creed based on the idea that man and society can be perfected through legislation, an accusation I am not certain is accurate. Certainly, liberalism in the left-wing sense can be seen as such, with its endless march towards 'equality' and progress, but I am not entirely convinced that right-libertarianism has that fault.

Parents reading this will no doubt be reassured - but lessons are observed anyway. In my first such inspection, I was observed for six lessons, and at that time, I was not unique in this. Some teachers I know had far more. All this happened when inspections lasted a whole week. The length of inspections has been reduced since, but, in my experience, the number of classroom visits pro rata has not dropped. All this talk of "shake-ups" is happening for another reason - one to which I have alluded before.

Eventually my kids grew up and I was on my second marriage when Biker Dude (what I call my husband because of his love for his Harley Davidson) found out I used to dabble in writing and encouraged me to try again. So I did. It was a romance and I targeted it for Harlequin. Because hey, everyone wants to write for Harlequin. Okay, not everyone, but I’d read so many Harlequin romances over the years I knew this was a publisher I wanted to write for. So I submitted my very first book to them. They rejected it. I wrote another book. Sent it to Harlequin. They rejected it. Fortunately, I take rejection very well. I kept writing. And submitting.

In fact, one of the great drivers for career progress in advertising is to reach a level of seniority where if anyone tells you your idea is shit, you can sack them on the spot. Whole agencies have been built on this principle.
In keeping with the theme of Chanukah, speakers pointed out the hard fight that the Maccabees had against the “political Jews” of that time. Jews who put their faith in the Greek nation first. Much like today, where Jews around the world look to the nations of the world for the very survival of Israel. Nations who historically caused the Holocaust. Yet from them, they seek salvation. And like the political Jews of days of old, this faith in the nations was to such an extent, that it was not beyond them to put Jews in danger and even joined the Greek legions in fighting against those heroes, the Maccabee’s.

Shockingly however, in the Monsanto patent case, the Patent Office simply excluded the process for melon breeding and allowed the plants and all parts of the plant, such as seeds and melon fruit, to be patented as an ‘invention’. This is blatantly illegal as plants and seeds are not man-made, and cannot legitimately be subjected to the monopoly control of multinational corporations. That is why activists are demanding an explicit ban on the patenting of breeding material, plants, genes, and animals and food derived thereof.
Also, if you've seen the Kids in the Hall sketch where Bruce McCulloch plays a little boy who brings a businessman named Mr. Stevenson (Kevin MacDonald) home with him and begs his mom (Scott Thompson) to keep him as a pet, you'll immediately "get" what the film is going for in terms of tone and style. Just substitute "businessman" with "colour crime movie maker," and you'll do fine.
Now let's say that author got requests from five agents for the full manuscript. Let's say that manuscript is 400 pages. Let's say the cost of printing that manuscript is ten cents per page at the local copy shop. Print one original at home on a laser printer and the cost of printing is around twenty-five cents per page. Just laser-printing is $100, plus the cost of paper, so call it $107.00. Now we need five copies (the author should keep the original should she or he need more copies down the road). 400 pages times five copies is 2,000 pages times twenty-five cents is $500. Now the author has to ship those full manuscripts. Via Priority Mail Flat Rate and with the label prepared online is $10.85, times five is $54.25.
During my ample time to "reflect," I had a thought. Everyone hates going to the DMV for just this reason. (Apologies to all you rockstars at the DMV....wherever you are hiding.) It seems to be common accepted knowledge that the DMV is chock full of inefficiencies, employees who could give a shit, pointlessly long and redundant paperwork and confusing lines that are impossible to navigate. Even if there was an employee who came in all gung-ho and full of (what's the word?) work ethic, would it matter? Would it make a difference? Would anyone notice? Would that employee be able to sustain his or her commitment to a job well done? Would it be long before the reputation of the DMV became a self-fulfilling prophesy? Before this individual was crushed into submission, bitterness, and fits of coughing by his or her colleagues?

I read as many as I could find from all over the world. Egyptian, Greek, Norse – Celtic legends I came to later, in my teens. And Native American legends I have only recently begun to explore as I researched for my book ‘Troll Blood’ which deals with the 10th century Norse settlements in Vinland (Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). Continent-wide and extraordinarily diverse, Native American cultural stories have often been misrepresented in European retellings, and I went right back to some of the earliest written records of the Mi’kmaq tales of the north-east and learned to distinguish between those which had been straightforwardly transcribed, and others which had been warped to suit European preconceptions. Myths and legends often have a political dimension which should never be ignored: far from being dead and dusty, they may be of immense importance to living people as proud symbols of an oppressed culture.

So what we have here is blue and pink hex glitter, plus smaller glitter that I think is round - those seem to just be silver - plus tiny blue glitter. All of this is suspended in a sheer light blue jelly base. The glitter is fairly sparse, though as I understand it, not as sparse as it is in Glitter in the Air. The first thing I needed to do was find suitable underwear, since I abhor visible nail line. I tried it over Misa Touch the Rainbow, which actually would have worked ok, but I found a better match in Barry M Blue Moon, since it has the same milky sort of formula that Whimsical does. This is Blue Moon as a full mani.

A more traditional biography is found in Gordon Bowker’s James Joyce ($35.00, Farrar, Straus and Giroux) due out in June. Fans of this author will find this an absorbing account of his life and work. Bowker deftly connects all the dots between his writing and his life such as how his years in Trieste influenced the shaping of “Ulysses” and the way he dealt with friends, poverty, and ill health. The miracle is how he was able to write epic novels celebrating the lives of ordinary people. He was an extremely complex man and hard even on his friends. Joyce is an acquired taste and regarded as a literary giant. This may well be the best biography to have been written about him.

This past week I've been researching and co-writing (with Dan Schreiber of BBC Radio 4's The Museum of Curiosity) the pilot for a new radio series. The show is called 101 People to Meet before You (or They) Die and it's a series of interviews with some of the world's most extraordinary people: explorers, scientists, artists, philosophers and much, much more. The pilot features Charles Brewer-Carias, the Venezuelan grandson of a British diplomat, who has spent much of his 72 years exploring the Amazon. He holds the world record for making fire using just sticks (2.7 seconds), has discovered over 100 species of plants and animals new to science (of which 20 or more were named after him), and may have discovered the world's oldest life form. He also claims to have found the location of El Dorado, the semi-mythical lost 'City of Gold'.

Eighth grade brought heartache and depression that nearly led to me taking my life. While many adolescents undergo a transformation, endure an awkward stage, I fell into an extremely dark place that I honestly did not see a way out of. I was wearing a Milwaukee brace for scoliosis and it couldn’t have come at a worse time. I was just starting to come out of my thick shell of crippling shyness when suddenly, I had to spend 23 hours a day in a contraption that in no way allowed me to be a wallflower. All that comes to mind of that school year was sleeping and waking up—and counting the hours till I could bury myself again at night and pray for death. Happiness was a word that couldn’t possibly ever appear in my vocabulary again.

Wildwood has a distinct doo-wop aesthetic and an endearing retro charm that sets it apart from other shore destinations. It has about 2 miles of boardwalk with arcades, great beach food, piers filled with amusement park rides, water parks, mini golf, all kinds of crazy attractions, shops, movie theaters, diners, tram cars, seagulls, a convention center, and Polish water ice. Everything is open pretty late and its a great place to stay with your friends.

Anyway, the first King book I ever read was a collection of short stories called Nightmares and Dreamscapes and I'd like to say that this volume was comparable but unfortunately it wasn't. Not for me anyway. There were thirteen stories included and I skim read a couple when they failed to engage. It was a good book to have handy in the airport where attention can wander and there is a lot of stopping and starting. I was able to pick up and dip in and out but this didn't make the return journey home with me, I left it at the hotel for someone else to hopefully enjoy more than I did. Sorry, Stephen!

The 2012 Pulitzer Prizes looked less like an excellence-in-media competition and more like an exercise in leftist self-affirmation. No prize established this more strongly than the coveted National Reporting prize going to -- The Huffington Post! The Pulitzer judges who would rather swallow rat poison than give an award to a conservative outlet, such as The Washington Times, are bestowing kudos on a site that thrives on such celebrity dreck as "Miley Shows Off Legs in Lacy Shorts" and "Kim Kardashian Kanye West Earrings: Reality Star Sports 'KW' Initial Jewelry."….. It's amazing that liberals have cartooned conservative thinkers as locked in a bubble or an echo chamber. These cheapened "prizes" expose the airless insularity of today's leftist journalism.

My goal is to get into great shape, so as painful as the class was, and as much as I knew I would be a noodle by the end of it, I pushed myself. About half way through the class, the instructor said she would be giving out a bracelet at the end of class to the person who worked the hardest. Part of me used the ‘free-gift with participation’ promise as motivation to power through the class. Nothing has really come easy for me in life (and definitely nothing fitness related), so to achieve my goals for this summer and to make sure that they stick, I need to keep pushing myself to succeed and to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

First, the problems. I feel a little uncomfortable about the representation of ordinary working class Suffolk folk to a spruced up, sophisticated London theatre audience. There are lots of genuine laughs, but some border on the way we used to mock The Beverly Hillbillies. In addition, other than one brilliantly excruciating extended silence when three street girls peer out from the freezing fog to challenge the audience’s cosiness, there’s no voice for the people who really lived at the heart of the terror, leaving everything to be said by the understandably hostile people they plied their trade around.

//-->As I was praying a few days ago God put in my spirit the story of David and Goliath. When I picked up my bible and read it I was amazed by the courage David exemplified by fighting Goliath. I spent a few days mediating on it and after a conversing with Phillip about David’s courage I realized that it takes courage to resist temptation. The story of David and Goliath is found in 1 Samuel 17. One of the things that stood out to me was Goliath’s appearance and taunts caused the Israelite soldiers to retreat in fear. Goliath represents temptation, a temptation to fear. Instead of having courage and fighting Goliath the Israelite army gave in to the temptation. In our lives temptation comes in variety of forms, and it appeals to our deepest desires and preys on our weaknesses. In being male, one of the most common forms of temptation for men is sexual temptation. Sexual temptation is so enticing that sometimes we feel it is irresistible, so why even try to resist. However, no matter what the temptation is courage is the antidote. Temptation comes to tell us that we are not strong enough to live a godly life. While courage says I know God has already put the strength in me to overcome every thing that may cause me to stray away from God. In other words having courage reflects the belief in God’s word and temptation tries to doubt God’s word. God says to us in Joshua 1:9, “have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous!”

The picture begins literally with a bang: an atomic test north of the Arctic Circle that frees the creature from suspended animation in the polar ice (audiences never tire of these stock shots of atomic explosions; they're as fascinating now as they were half a century ago). The first man to see the beast is one of the attending scientists (Ross Elliott, in the designated role of First Expendable Victim). The second witness is the other scientist, our hero Tom Nesbitt (Swiss actor Paul Hubschmid, under the anglicized name of Paul Christian), and the movie's first act follows Nesbitt's crusade to prove to the skeptics around him -- his military pal Col. Jack Evans (The Thing from Another World's Kenneth Tobey), paleontologist Dr. Thurgood Elson (Cecil Kellaway) and Elson's assistant Lee Hunter (Paula Raymond) -- that he saw what he saw. Meanwhile there are a number of unexplained occurences, including the sinking of a fishing boat whose sole survivor is dismissed as a deranged crackpot when he claims it was the work of a "sea serpent" (the sailor is played by John Ford regular Jack Pennick, his grotesque teeth either straightened or, more likely, replace by dentures).

So this year I wanted to make her something that tasted great, and since I know she loved my triple chocolate mousse cake, I decided to make her a Hello Kitty triple chocolate mousse cake!

That’s why it’s important to never run, or even download, a program from an untrusted source—and by “source,” I mean the person who wrote it, not the person who gave it to you. There’s a nice analogy between running a program and eating a sandwich. If a stranger walked up to you and handed you a sandwich, would you eat it? Probably not. How about if your best friend gave you a sandwich? Maybe you would, maybe you wouldn’t—it depends on whether she made it or found it lying in the street. Apply the same critical thought to a program that you would to a sandwich, and you’ll usually be safe.

It does seem like a good program and I can probably learn to really like it. I’m just having a bit of trouble switching.

All three states have a long history of partnership with Eastern Europe. This partnership geopolitically as well as ideologically was rooted in the cases of Libya and Iraq in a common interest to counterbalance Western economic and political advances since at least the 1970s. This was true also for Yugoslavia a decade later. And all three of them were willing to trade on barter or bilateral clearing as well as on hard currency basis. This mixture could be seen best in the Soviet-Iraqi system of trade. Iraqi oil was imported by the Soviet Union in exchange for Soviet weapons, and then Moscow sold this oil to India on hard currency basis in a triangular arrangement. Libya was one of the main importers of Soviet military equipment outside Comecon after 1978, when Tripoli opposed the Camp David accords as a betrayal of long-term Arab aspirations. Estimations rise to 10 % of the Soviet hard currency earnings in early 1980s realised by the trade with Libya. Also this trade could have been a triangular one, although it was never published to what extent the Soviet weapons were re-exported by Libya to other African states.

Ask a road cycling fan if they have a significant pre-Olympics gripe, and it's unlikely they'll cite spiralling costs, a surface-to-air missile on the roof terrace or even Duran Duran.

The real answer is that both publisher and author already do. If anything, the mainstream publisher has no choice, but at least the small press publisher and self-published author can resign themselves to the reality of niche market, flexibility, the potential to exploit a direct social network with their customers and readers, and without the impending pressures of having to make a title pay soon after publication and move on to the next batch of titles. If anything, we are quickly learning that the savvy self-published author can become highly adept at fusing the tools of social networking, along with their own personal web presence and online sales platforms like Amazon, Scribd, Smashwords, and the Apple iBookstore.
Dear Blog Friends,
We decided to drive down to Marmaris, a 10 hour drive and spend the week at the summer house. It has been great. It is cool, about 60 and a little rainy but incredibly gorgeous. During the summer it is usually about 100 degrees so it is so nice to take walks along the sea or in the mountain without seriously worrying about heat stroke and death.
I'm really enjoying it here. Getting used to the road system, and the laid back attitude is just a way of life. It gets frustrating at times, but you learn to live with it. This is not the first place I have lived where the attitude is like this. But at least here it gets done eventually, if not a bit later than expected or hoped for. In other places it might never get done.. It also helps that when driving, it's a great, big car, you know that if anything happens, you're safe, unless it's one fo those really annoying Hummer's you're crashing with..
These are very general tips which apply differently to different situations. Use your judgment to decide when and how to use them.

I’ve been tweeting about this today and a white man asked me not to “lump all white people in” and to that I have this to say : you are in no danger of being lumped in with white racists and racist institutions when you are fighting them with those they are oppressing. You’re silence on issues like Trayvon Martin is agreement with those people and institutions that do not believe he deserves justice. This goes for white and black and hispanic and all people alike in America. you’re silence will NOT protect you! Black people, do not think that this couldnt happen to you or your child because it COULD. If you are silent or you sleep on Trayvon’s story then you send the message that this is permitted. You ARE Trayvon Martin because but for the grace of God go you.

Okay, so I promised myself that I’d post in the happiness blog everyday, work on my different shops, status posts, promotion, website, etc a little bit each day. This has been great for solidifying my ‘brand’ as my BF calls it. It has challenged me to just sit down and write each day and I’ve learned so much about Twitter, Facebook, Social Networking, SEO, Online Sales, YouTube promotional practices and Copyrights, Etc, Etc. Seriously, I feel like I took a self taught online marketing class last week. And I’ve made new friends in the blogging and online world. That’s the good part.

The plan is you start the tablets on day one, smoke normally through the first week, and then pick a date in the second week to stop. I picked day 13, popped my first small pill and read the very VERY long list of possible side effects, ranging from nausea, funny dreams etc to suicide (I think one person committed suicide while they happened to be on the drug, so they can’t say it wasn’t a side effect of the drug, well that’s my opinion anyway!) I can safely say that having been on the tablets now for 7 weeks, I have not had a single side effect.
Today is a very exciting day. JustRtie Papercraft is launching the April Release. If you could look over my shoulder, you'd see papers and pencils everywhere. I've been doing freelance design for JustRite. Today we launch the "Amy Tedder Designs" line. We have been so busy over the past few weeks. That means sketching, drawing, computer fun, and lots of feedback. So today feels like Christmas morning!
Another person, T., at the seder replied rather sharply to her: What about serial murderers, like the man in Toulouse who just murdered seven people, including three children? Can't you say of a person like that that he really is evil? Some people are just evil.

Obadiah froze, suddenly seeing a very sharp memory inside his head. He saw himself arrive at the Epsum Illum cafe on that first day in autumn almost four years ago.

Most dubstep is pretty light on lyrics, but it’s possible to make a dubstep remix of basically anything (if you click on one link in this post, make it this one).

Now, temperature during incubation decides gender in Geckos. If Gecko eggs are all left to hatch under the same temperature, you will either have all boys or all girls. There’s no doubt our two Geckos were born on different sides of a tank. No, we don’t have eggs yet, but we’ve done our homework and inspection and we absolutely have a colorful meat-headed male (Treeko) and a dull colored slender female (Yoshi). Discovering this is only the beginning of a long line of entertaining moments. And I thought these guys were going to be boring…

Let us further examine the above findings against an observation of the state of the environment, whose unintrrupted support is vital to human survival. To guarantee their survival on long-term basis, humans must exponentially decrease their energy and material demands on the environment. But is that the case? Again, the evidence suggests the opposite to be true. Human consumption is on the exponential rise and, increasingly, the environment is failing to provide support.

Near where I was heading I was forced to negotiate like you do driving in So Cal now. Thankfully my parents, the speed daemons they were taught me strong driving skills. My father ever the defensive driver showed me how to avoid being ‘boxed in’ trapped or run out of the way. He said “If you have speed. Use it.” He taught me WHO to watch out for, the nuances in the vehicles movements of clueless drivers.
Beltane is a fertility Sabbat. According to Edain McCoy, in her book ‘Sabbats: A Witch’s Approach To Living The Old Ways’, it is “one that celebrates life above all”. This is the Sabbat celebrating the marriage of the God to the Goddess and the consummation of their marriage.
There is a great deal in Nietzsche that must be dismissed as merely megalomaniac… It is obvious that in his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all the men he admires were military. His opinion of women, like every man’s, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear. “Forget not thy whip”–but nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks.

I am actually rather surprised this didn’t make ‘The Orange Longlist’ this year but it was one of the Waterstones 11 and has been picked up by Richard and Judy latest book club (and might just have been submitted for another award – I think I can share that with you, oops maybe not) so I am sure it will be getting much more attention and it deserves it. It is definitely one to read if you loved ‘One Day’ by David Mitchell, as I mentioned, and also if you like the bittersweet. Which debut novel have you read recently which has rather bowled you over? Has anyone else read ‘When God Was A Rabbit’ and what did you think?

Now, as you can imagine, most of the poems were dreadful, but that wasn't the point. They were fun. They were silly, and irreverent, and the authors had obviously had a great time writing them. They weren't intended to be published - at least I hope not - they were simply a way of having a good time, and creating something personal to be shared with the writer's friends.

Donations are down, we have lost quite a few sponsors and we are desperate for fundraisers. I boldly have been asking if anyone can help us , put out a donation tin or hold a bottle drive or car wash for us. My money is gone and with no job and no unemployment insurance we are in trouble. I repeat my mantra "we will be okay, we will be okay".. A huge sum has been spent and my money has run out that I took out to carry us all threw this move and rebuild. Not being able to find work was inconceivable as surely the economy would be better by now I thought.

When I was 15 I had become even more sick. Leah had been living away from home since she was 16 (early to college then a banking career) but returned home when she lost her job after 9/11. I begrudgingly shared a room with her and tried to forget she was there, as well as the mess she left in her wake (the mess will always travel behind Leah…). It had been 3 years since spending time with Leah and she didn’t know the magnitude of what my disordered had done to my body or my life. Soon after returning home, Leah witnessed one of the scariest experiences I’ve ever had with my muscle disorder.

Hubby and I decided to clean the ceiling fans this morning. It will soon be ceiling fan season here in the UK. While doing the job we realised that our vacuum cleaner has seen better days. So at lunchtime we headed out to have a look at them. We quite often order stuff on online but I think when it comes to a vacuum cleaner it’s good to test the weight and such before you buy. So we came home with a lovely new vacuum cleaner which was promptly assembled and tested on the living room carpet and it picked up a lot more dust and dirt than the last one. It’s magic.

Speaking of letting things go… I recently read How To Forgive and at the end I was crying (it doesn’t take much, apparently) and commented to her post. It is very much like a weight being lifted off your shoulders once you do decide to forgive. There are certain moments/incidents/people that I have a hard time forgiving. I know… I know that forgiving doesn’t forgive the act, or the person but only letting yourself go from worrying about it. I’m an anxious person by nature. I worry almost all the time – I just can’t help it. The only time I’m not worried is when I’m sleeping (usually have nightmares though) or taken medicine to sleep/chill out. Or drinking – which that is rare these days.

I spend most of my time watching movies out of sync with my time and place. Since I prefer cinema from elsewhere, only one U.S. film makes my Top Ten, though it does make the top spot. Work and financial constraints keep me from traveling abroad for film festival premieres, which means I have to wait until they make it here to San Francisco. So my Top Ten lists usually say something about my cosmopolitan dreams that are anchored awake by my restricted finances and mobility. But here are 10 films which were released this year, or made their way to Bay Area festivals in 2011, about which I have found myself still ruminating in a positive way since they shined their light and heat on my eyes.
I have a pocketful of 1 yuan bills and coins, change from getting metro tickets, and I hand these out to the men with amputated feet, paralyzed arms, or other disfigurements that prevent them from working.

"It took Wilderness three years to complete their self-titled debut album. Spending that much time crafting a complex yet intriguing soundscape that has nothing to do with alternative rock, period, is not only beyond impressive, but also brilliant. It's smart in the sense that Wilderness maintain a stance away from the classic three-chord formula. They create their own post-punk-inspired shuffle without falling into the kitsch of their peers. Wilderness is led by the chaotic vocal warbling of frontman James Johnson, an obvious comparison to John Lydon's Public Image Ltd., but also an eerie vocal resemblance to Yan of British Sea Power, quickly establishes the band's disciplined approach. While the ten-song set is an elaborate adaptation of ominous guitars, thunderous drums, and sneaky basslines, Wilderness itself delivers a melancholic nervousness. Songs such as "Arkless," the blighted hopes of "End of Freedom," and the slow burn of "Fly Farther to See" press hard in such a vein. Some could have lost scope of an album's natural psyche with taking such an extensive amount of time recording it; however, Wilderness are a group of extreme perfectionists. This album never had a chance to be anything but good." - AMG

We needed some help to pull off a ceremony we loved in just two weeks. Amber’s sister-in-law Ellen (who lives in Chicago and has great taste) picked out the bouquet and boutonniere from Church Street Flowers (a favorite shop of Amber's in San Francisco) and had them delivered to us the morning of the wedding. Ellen sent Amber some pictures of possible options from the florist, but in the end, Amber just deferred to Ellen's pick & they were perfect -- they were completely Amber's style and it was an awesome way for our family to be a part of our day even though they couldn't be there in person.

If I were advising the president, here's the speech I would suggest he give. It's 25 seconds from beginning to end -- only 6 seconds if you exclude the formalities of the intro and ending. It never once uses the words "I" or "me", it never once tries to blame Bush (or Congress or DC or natural disasters or some vague, anonymous "they") for the problems he has created, it uses no meaningless platitudes nor offers grand but vacuous promises. In other words, it's unlike any speech Obama has ever given.

These are important questions to ask, and I will get to them in a moment. First, let us notice a few things. Do you see any important differences between the assertion that “Jesus didn’t exist,” and the assertion that “You are an inferior human being,” which is the sort of thing that hate groups like the neo-Nazis and the KKK often assert? The former statement attacks an idea; the latter attacks a person. Furthermore, if a person is attacked for their race, gender, sexual orientation, and so on, that is something they cannot change. Beliefs can change – and should! – based on evaluation of evidence, but if someone despises you for who you are, there’s nothing you can do about it.

And there are some brilliant books being published, from fine established writers and debut authors alike. When you take the long view – and to borrow from Julia Eccleshare when she introduced the Branford Boase Award in 2011 – if that shortlist was anything to go by, writing and publishing for children is actually in very good shape. And that reflects that everywhere there are writers writing and editors supporting books they love, regardless of how hard it is. We don’t give up, do we?

It was really amazing to see the intersection of Hanson and South Oxford transformed with a full stage and attendant audience. My mind started to wander back to the days when a carnival used to be held on the land that is now Atlantic Commons. All those newly built homes on either side of Cumberland were only built around 1994 prior to that the entire area was an open barren field most of the time, except in the late summer when the carnival came. That's probably a story I should get into deeper someday. My mind also drifted to the opening or re-opening of Cuyler Gore park, that tiny little triangle of parkland between Green Av., Fulton St. and Carlton Av. There was a big rededication when that park was restored which I remember because it was about 1981 and I was a Cub Scout whose troop was part of ceremony. We were told Mayor Koch was supposed to come for the open and he never did. I guess pols today have a better appreciation for how an appearance or lack-there-of can form memories.
Havekost, in brilliant fashion, gives us an image of a pop figure that is decidedly not pop—this is no Warhol Superman, this is no Polke broken screen. Spiderman is not allowed glory yet he is not allowed disgrace either, he just stands somewhere between the known and the disguised. The painting itself, how it is employed, its coyness, its pale shyness, is an unusual metaphor for such a recognizable pop figure. The touchstone here, a known entity of culture, is thus reanimated in a new and unusual way. This is a good painting.
