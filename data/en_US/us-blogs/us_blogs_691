As Bryce sat at our dining room table working on a puzzle, Trevin excitedly came over to "help" him. As he was giving Bryce pieces to the puzzle, the following conversation ensued...
He had a bizarre, eclectic record collection: Neil Diamond, Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Willie Nelson, Barry Manilow, Olivia Newton-John, Waylon Jennings, Jesse Colter, The Rolling Stones, ELO, ZZ Top, Moe Bandy and the Rodeo Clowns, The Eagles, Linda Rondstat, and lots and lots of Elvis. I fell in love to listening to music in that crappy apartment. I picked it apart as I listened to it--isolating drum lines and harmonies and guitar parts in my head. I would teach myself how to sing all of the harmonies of ELO and the back up parts for Neil Diamond. I was determined to be a background singer when I grew up. Or Olivia Newton-John. Either one would've worked for me.
In fact, there are so many French people in London that this city has been dubbed “Paris-on-Thames.” An estimated 300,000 Londoners are French, which makes London the equivalent of France’s sixth largest city.
No? Well, my history textbooks didn't mention her, either, but that's not surprising. Women weren't usually mentioned in my history classes, back in the 1940s and 1950s, unless as the "wife of" -- a king or a president, maybe. But if you've ever seen the 1964 movie "Mary Poppins," you've at least heard the name "Missus Pankhurst," as the song writer called her. Let me refresh your memory with this short clip, and then I'll tell you the story of Emmaline Pankhurst.

Now, only three days after that last puzzling session, Riley Peterson was dead by unnatural causes. Moody was again sitting quietly in the living room and thinking after the sheriff left. The music coming from her father’s work room was muffled, but she could make out the beginning of Simon and Garfunkel’s “The Sound of Silence.”

Alright, here goes with the fourth beer in what is probably the most disappointing BOTM club shipment since the one with three wits in it. It's a porter, so I'm hoping for the best. I don't get the baby blue and yellow label though. It's a porter, not bottled water. Well, I hope not, anyway.
Although Travis never poses a serious threat to Dexter’s life, his dark antics and secrets, coupled with his grotesque killings in the name of God make him a serious villain, and earn him the number four spot on the list. Travis, who for most of the season is working with his mentor “Doomsday”, or Professor Gellar, murders victims and displays them in scenes from the Book of Revelations, which predicts the Apocalypse. We later find out Gellar has been dead for years and exists only in Travis’ mind, and he is the only one carrying out these heinous murders. What Travis lacks in kill count, and threat to Dexter and his family, he makes up for in his dramatic season ending death.
So I, given my history of frequenting the odd nightclub, found a nightclub location and threw myself a party, a party rich with a chick-lit reading audience! I couldn’t have done it without the awesome event planning guys at 1neFLO entertainment who put it all together. I printed the stuff, they themed and set-up my party, and the club was absolutely packed that night..so it all worked out! It also couldn’t have been a more fitting venue, given the nights out that are chronicled in “Year of the Chick.”

Have been reading some rumblings and grumblings about the new blogger interface, and while I didn't ask for it I have no problems using it....but then my blogging is pretty basic, I haven't tried any of the fancy-nancy stuff that some bloggers do. One of these days I might get enthusiastic and carried away, but not yet. I know one's blog is one's blog, and you are not doing it for other people (although some do, I'm sure) but black backgrounds are too hard on the reader's eyes. And blingy backgrounds that keep moving and shaking and have things like snowflakes or flowers or bees or butterflies continually falling down the screen are just as bad. Perhaps it's my imagination, but nearly every art quilter's blog that I have come across has a black background. It's a bit like choosing what clothes to wear or how to decorate one's house - while you want to be comfortable with your own choice, others have to live with it too. End of rant, thank you for listening, returning you to your regular station now.

She did great the first few months...even sleeping through the night fairly early. I thought we were SO lucky! By 4 months it all fell apart. I didn't worry too much, most 4 month olds sleep like shit, that's no secret. But she never improved. We have the same policy with her-but she very much takes advantage of it, and often wakes every hour. I consulted with her pediatrician, who advised me to let her cry. I can't stomach that. We've been working on a gentler approach, which has been marred by viruses and ear infections.

First of all when I went in for my doc appt in August, when I was leaving, the doc ( not my usual one ) said just watch the weight gain, you have gained 5 pounds this month...I about freaked out then because I was like wsit a minute..no way, at that point I had only gained 8 pounds in total ( 16 weeks pregnant ) so I pulled the nurse to the side and said can you look back at the 2 past appts to see what they had down for me..anyway come to find out that they had my starting weight wrong, by about 7 pounds lighter than I was. Of course I was freaking and everyone was like don't worry about it you are fine but they would not change my weight on the chart!!

Well, apparently the time had come because when I was roasting the eggplant for my last recipe on the week end, I knew I wanted to make some fabulously crusty bread to eat it with. I had the time, a whole night ahead of me. Perfect.
Then we moved on why I don’t speak out in relationships when I am not happy. Fear of loneliness and abandonment issues snuck in. We discussed my recent(ish) break up with my boyfriend ‘X’. He was a great guy, we got on really well and he never made me feel insecure. However ‘things’ just weren’t working for him in the bedroom, poor guy, and he broke it off with ‘I’m just not physically attracted to you, even though I’m attracted to you in other ways’.

Rules of Negotiation was a fun and really quick read that unfortunately I won't remember for long since I finished reading it. It's cute story, written by a really talented author but somehow it's not something either extraordinary or fresh. It's a story told so many times already and that is probably why I will soon forget everything about it.
Poured about 1/8 of an inch of beer, and several inches of foam. When that settled down, the beer was a coppery brown like a bock, with a head that would never go away. Which is usually a good thing, but not now.

I’m definitely ready to get back on the bandwagon now. I’ve reached the point of disgust with NOT working out and am completely ready to begin. Michelle and I had a talk today and decided that we’d re-start the BodyRock 30 Day Challenge that we meant to begin before I left for Japan. Yeah, we started it, but we didn’t get very far. Life happens sometimes.
Our home is not overly large or small, and Alberto and I each have our own corners that we disappear into for the better part of a day. He has an upstairs office with all that he needs up there except for a bathroom and kitchen. I tend to work at the table in the breakfast area, and relax in the living room. As most couples do, we have different TV viewing preferences, though we will often watch a movie we like together, usually in bed, or in the living room. I don't visit the man cave very often.

Welcome to the Willow Manor Ball! The cyber event of the season is finally here. We have rolled back the carpets of the main hall.

This book also critiques and satirizes some big, honkin' issues. Maguire explores the nature of evil, implications of religion, human rights, revolution. I was genuinely surprised and delighted by how political in nature this book became at times. I was most compelled when Elphaba was embroiled in some plot or other and impassioned by the dwindling rights and oppression of Animals (animals with a human capacity for intelligence, thought, and communication). It was easy to see how she started strong and almost naively passionate about issues in her college years, but withered and became embittered with time. Though, I have to say, she was never as bitter and never wicked as one might associate with the book or film version.

Suddenly, twin gunmen, Barry and Larry Turner, step out of the shadows, demanding all their money. Kaleb complies, telling them where their money is kept. The Turner's ransack the wagon and not being pleased with the amount, kill Kaleb. The Turner's say that anyone on the trail to Sutter's Mill are only there to buy gold so there must be more money somewhere.

Now feel free to ruin it for yourselves and see if you can find it on youtube.com but it’s still not the same as seeing him live. (Although he does have 3 screens for the audience because there are some very high up seats in some arena’s which I should add make it actually hard to see Mr Kay but even those that can see him well enough find it hard not to look at the screens which is a bit of a pain when you have paid good money to see him.

Also, snake populations tend to be greater in areas rife with rodents. If you’re having an ongoing problem with snakes around your home, even getting into your home, your real problem might be rodents! The primary food of many snakes, especially the larger ones, is rodents (mice, voles, rats). When a property develops a healthy population of rodents, snakes can move in as well.
These matters sooner or later will result in a total breakdown of self respect and law and order.

Wyoming – John Denver recorded a lot of songs about states without naming his songs after them. In the end, literally, I found one called “Song of Wyoming” about the wide open spaces and natural wonders of the West. Of course, he had a bunch of songs about the same topics. This one just happened to fit in the list.

Yes, we are still here. I have no good reason for my major blogging hiatus. Other than perhaps I had gotten a bit overwhelmed with trying to keep up with updates and maybe dare I say bored with blogging. I love my family and updating you on all of the fun things we do. But, I think I will give up the idea that every single thing has to be documented on the blog. (Though I do plan to finish and post all the pictures/updates that have been sitting here for 5 months waiting to be published.)

Well she’s trying to pick a graduate school, and she is afraid him being in Europe is affecting her decision. I think so too, but I don’t think it matters. How often do you get to move to England, study the one thing you’re passionate about AND be with the guy you’re in love with? I swear it’s like a movie. I plan to write a book about it one day.
A Buddhist burning incense before an image of a bodhisattva, a Christian prayerfully studying the narratives of the Bible, or for that matter a Druid standing with arms outstretched in the midst of circle of trees in the rain, taking part in the dance of the natural world, are all contemplating that which they hope, in their own way, to imitate. All three, and their equivalents in other traditions, are aware of the other side of the balance; the Buddhist affirms the reality of suffering, the Christian likely considers original sin as a fact of existence, the Druid knows full well that the dance of nature also includes pain and death, but the devotional and meditative practices of these and other faiths carefully balance such reflections with a more sustained contemplation of exactly those things the believer seeks to imitate.
So, we're spending enormous sums on an organisation built on the 1940's concept that centralised state planning and provision is the only way to provide a national health service free at the point of use. This approach has failed to deliver consistently excellent service as expected. There's been much tinkering at the edges to attempt to improve things but nothing that has been in any way adequate. And now the money's running out. David Cameron is committed to maintaining real terms funding and is avoiding real NHS budget cuts. However, after a decade of fiscal incontinence that has seen the NHS's budget more than double, the organisation has lumbered from poor productivity to worse. Some, politically motivated performance targets have been met (especially around elective appointments) at the expense of professional medical judgement in many cases and overall quality of care has dropped.

And in this wrenching recession we’re in, workers 55+ have been laid off at twice the rate of younger ones. Laid off workers over 45 took an average wage cut of 20% when they did manage to get a new job. And no matter how much wisdom, strength and power you have in your hands and heart, when you’re 73, it’s mighty tough out to land a job.

I had a dream about their baby last night. I remember it perfectly. It was a boy, dark hair, really small, but he was wearing overalls and a green shirt... not sure where that outfit came from. I've never seen a baby come into the world fully clothed before haha. I also got told that our due date was pushed to September 28th instead of September 1st which makes me really question the validity of this dream haha. This is coming from the women who dreamt that my oldest daughter was an Eskimo boy and I kept forgetting her everywhere around town. It was quite inaccurate considering I had a little blond hair, blue eyed baby girl.
We see in the media talk of plans for growth and development, even from the side of the quasi-right, building this and growing that all the hope of reversing the clock to the day before the crash. Unfortunately that cannot be done.

Back to the Vatican and tourists. The Vatican is absolutely massive. You could push a wingless 747 through the front door. Inside is a quite frankly vulgar exhibition of wealth. Out in the courtyard where the masses gather to watch the Pope read out stories to them are some pillars with large statues on top. There are so many that the Church could sell every second one to the worlds Oligarchs and use the money to pay off third world debt. I am confident this hasn’t occurred to the good people of the Vatican. Given that so many millions of English-speaking Catholics visit the Vatican every year you would expect the tourist guides to have a couple of languages, you know, like a hostess on an Airline can manage. I approached a tourist guide with a badge that said ‘information’ on his lapel. Asked him if he spoke English? He shook his head. I sighed and shook mine.

Explained that I chose to contact them due to this article (originally published on October 17, 2004 in the London Sunday Times, behind a paywall here). Explained in the simplest terms what had occurred (from being a witness and test subject in 1989 and 1990, to the harassment and worse from 2009 up to today). Also explained how and why this is possible, from Ike’s warning to the formation of the secret police AKA “Top Secret America”, how it is actually far too large to justify its existence and it therefore creating problems on the one hand in order to sort of solve them on the other.

446. Chicken Caesar Salad @ Sly Fox Brewery (Phoenixville, PA) 1:12 p.m.
I had a personal break through this week that I want to mention - I FINALLY learned how to skate backwards. Yes at 33, my 14 year old daughter found the key to unlocking my ability to skate in reverse. I have been trying all season to figure out how it is done. I watched others, I tried it myself, I listened to suggestions, but for some reason I just could not get more than two or three little movements before I would be in a dead stop or a spin. Well today we got to free skate a few minutes early and had the entire place to ourselves. We got right out into the middle of the ice and started playing around, spinning, turning, attempting to go backwards and suddenly I was doing it a little bit more than I had before. KM was making different suggestions to me and I was trying all the different things when suddenly I had made it from one side of the rink to other, it was jerky and no where near smooth, but I made it. At this point some other skaters arrived and I was nervous about them being behind me. When I would glance over my shoulder my whole body would move causing me to feel unsteady and catch my skate. I just kept trying though. KM was very supportive and started skating in front of me to keep an eye out when she suddenly said, "Move like the samba" - WELL DUH!!! That was it, I moved like I was doing the Samba and I skated backwards flawlessly. That was my key, she kept trying and finally found a way for me to understand what she was doing. I was so proud of myself, but I was even more proud of her. She didn't get frustrated or give up on me, she just kept trying. I feel like this is what I do every day with her and DN - I try to find just the right words, programs, approach, resources, games etc. to help them reach their potential and her she was doing the same for me!
My Dad and I were clearly the least prepared hikers making the journey, even the other day hikers had knapsacks and walking poles and since we didn't even realize we'd BE hiking until my dear friend Abby, with whom I co-ran Law Women in law school, told us this venture was a can't-miss for any visit to Tahoe. That is how you could find me in kid-size addidas sneakers (just bought for their cheapness as all I packed were flip flops, my one true clothing love aside from Tutu's) carrying a beach bag as we made the 3.5 mile hike to Aloha Lake. We got lost, my dad got a blister, and I added more red blotches to my already sunburned skin, but it was truly truly breathtaking.
In the late 1800s, both Émile Durkheim (1893) and Ferdinand Tönnies (1887) approached the idea of social networks in their theories and research of social groups. Tönnies asserted that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (community) or impersonal, formal, and instrumental social links (society or organizations in this context). Durkheim (1893) gives a non-individualistic explanation of social facts arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that stands beyond the will and control of an individual. In connection to that, Georg Simmel (1908), writing towards end of the twentieth century, commented also commented on the nature of networks and the effect of network size basing on interaction and concluded that relations formed out of social interaction ends up making a loose network rather than forming a group.

On Thursday night I embarked on a marvelous solo adventure to Koh Tao, which means Turtle Island. After a long and arduous journey, I arrived on this beautiful island around 10 in the morning. I took a much-needed nap in my seedy bungalow, then rented a motorbike and headed to Shark’s Bay to lie on the beach and lounge in the sun. I tried not to stare at the hot bare-breasted European women who were sunbathing, but it was a useless effort. Later I made my way to Sairee beach where I had a minor accident on my motorbike. Bystanders laughed at me once they saw I was alright.
The celebrations and the service were very moving and very meaningful. I know some were apprehensive but it was not, on the day, about the hype. It was about a real celebration of something exciting God is doing in our midst.
Just this quick sampling reveals the nation is being run in an astonishingly incompetent and stupid fashion. The government’s repeated use of lies and fear to influence public opinion is dangerous in so many ways. It is fundamentally unAmerican.

“To the other side,” Arrys called and charged across the bridge. His men rushed behind him as the smashing and rumbling came in more aggressive beats. When they turned to look at the commotion, they saw a massive number of the sea creatures Anon described through his messenger. In a matter of seconds, the Frayed Bridge crumbled to pieces into the river and a massive number of foes began marching toward the Obsidian Army. General Arrys looked toward the fortress, searching for a direct path to get his men within its walls. As he looked around, he saw many of the monsters aiming crossbows at him and his men from the guard towers within Seaside Keep.

Public fears that the world will end on 21st December 2012 - and/or that a new world will then dawn - are currently widespread, and promise to reach panic levels by the autumn of 2012. Peter Lemesurier's 2012: IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD: The Truth About the Mayan Calendar addresses those fears directly, examining in detail the main titles from among the huge amount of doom-mongering literature on the subject (and virtually all of it is doom-mongering!)) and dismissing most of it for the nonsense it is.

Just like Rick, this girl washes up, in strange garb, with no apparent memories but her name. The girls took Rick under their wing and taught him how to bake in lieu of his old life which he didn’t remember anyway. But this Kaguya girl might remember something, if only she could stay awake for more than a few moments. As for her pendant, it just screamed “Laputa.” We weren’t quite sure about the connection between the pendant and Hank’s “doll” weapon, or about what a bunch of guys with swords expect to do against a fleet of what look like advanced dreadnoughts. Like we said; not a lot of sense in play.

Unfortunately I don't live in DC or in Virginia, I live in Delaware. My commute to DC was already two and a half hours one way, and I'm supposed to add another hour onto that. Is he kidding?

We saw many more exhibits that related to nature, outer space, the environment, the human body, and many more. There was this bed of nails that you could lay on, which I tried out! Of course, this did not hurt at all because the nails were not up when you got onto the apparatus, and then you pushed a button and the nails raised up. Since your weight was distributed evenly across the bed, it didn't hurt one bit!
Pours dark coffee color with a weak head and no lacing of note. Smells vaguely of a vanilla milkshake and tastes of caramel building to a pleasant but vague vanilla finish that’s dry like a wine at the end. Not as delectably delicious as I’d hoped but not a complete letdown and just a cut above the Avalanche Amber.
I am in the Scholarship Program because: When I was young my parents weren’t able to send me to school. They picked coffee and traveled to follow the harvest. Even though I am older now, I want to take advantage of this opportunity to study at the Cultural Center. After I finish Adult Basic Education, I’d like to study sewing or cake making. My goal is to have a small business out of my home and generate an income for my family. I feel proud to study and discover that I can succeed.

Since that talk I've been looking around at all the nothing we've been doing here lately, and rather than make a lengthy post, I'll make a list that barely tips the iceberg of all the nothingness.
Here is a small (!) selection of our holiday snaps........
How people feel before seeing the fruit photos
And a modest proposal. If the Simon Wisenthal Center is leading the charge against Zionophobia, may I suggests a few additional targets? How about a campaign against pedocidophobia, which is, to paraphrase a famous if defunct EUMC definition, "a certain perception of sodliers which may be expressed as hatred towards soldiers who shoot and kill children."
If there's one thing that's universally beautiful about humans, it's the eyes. I've never seen a set that didn't hold at least some visual pleasure. Though I do have my favourites, they're not based on colour as much as intensity. Those which radiate, pierce with soft barbs, and draw the viewer in, like a black hole pulling all to it's infinite centre. Drawing nearer, you can distinguish the cornucopia of colours - even in what may appear to be the most monochromatic eyes. All it takes is the time to notice, and the awareness of such things.
Few remember the now nearly extinct old-fashioned gas stations complete with service repair bays, staff mechanics, and attendants who pumped the gas for the customer as he or she stayed in their car. Not only were they businesses that for decades met the needs of the American car culture but in many ways they provided a degree of free services that while very small nonetheless have left a gaping hole in daily life.
Mr. DePlasco emphasized that the money given to Build was intended to fulfill the company's obligations under the community-benefits agreement.
This month's moon over Sydney was lost to rain clouds.. So I pulled out an old favourite here.. dressed her in moonlight.. and popped her up on the mantle for you! And to appease the blog gods.. I sent that moon over to Atrani and gave her a Aussie beach xmas theme.. Covering all my bases in one post to make up for lost time!
Why are you so far from me? Why can't you see everything I do? There's a lot of things I'd like to show you.
We call up my mom and get a ride to church and inform our landlord, the Whitmers of the horrible plight (this will be the 4th time we've had problems with our garage door in 4 years). We get rides home from church from our friends. All our Sunday evening activities where we thought it would be cool to drive to were stymied. Our dear home teacher, Bro. Stanley looks at the thing after church, as does James, and they both see that there's no way it'll work.
Claim the joy that is yours as a Christian. Remind yourself often of the incredible truth that, as a Christian, you have eternal life in heaven awaiting you. Let the knowledge of that wonderful gift from Jesus give you joy every day.
What you should avoid: cool as they may be, aviator glasses are not suited for the heart-shaped amongst us.
Just wanted to come back and tell you again and again and for always how much we love you. I did it for you, telling them your story, I wanted them to tell the world (or at least tv land) that having another baby or having a great day or having lots of nice things will never take away the deep black hole that is missing you. I wanted someone watching to understand that birth means nothing if you don't get your baby at the end. I wanted pregnant women to stop all the bullshit about candles and eloquent music, and just focus on safety and wellness and that one sparkly fantastic fireworks moment that is laying your hands on a living, breathing baby. I went away feeling like I didn't say enough, but then, I know I never can.

“There won’t be any animals here.” I correct him, “This is a strange place to them especially with me here.”
Yijun pan, one of the sheffield hallam university student expressed her feelings about this issue. “It’s a rare case as one should be suffering the overseas trial on the copy right infringement. I can’t help in thinking that we should give it a more attention when dealing with an online material or use some stuff on line which we do have the copy right yet.”
CAD is expected to hit a record high of 3.5% of GDP in FY12. Thats close to $70bn. This gap needs to be filled by capital imports. Thankfully, FIIs are investing so far this year. At best though FIIs will contribute $10-15bn. The rest needs to come from FDI. With the government fighting cases with Vodafone, Telenor etc, FDI is unlikely to be strong in FY13.
I also wore the blazer with black trouser jeans (left) and with gray slacks (right). I liked the contrast of the bright white with the darker color pattern, so wore a white top with it twice. Both white tops had ruffle detailing, and on the jeans pic I accessorized with a raspberry color belt.

I told the Dr. that the cramping had started yesterday along with heavier bleeding. But there was still concern because I was still not even really needing a pad. I expected this to feel like a heavy period, but so far it is completely different. He suggested we do an ultrasound to confirm that the pregnancy was not ectopic. I have to admit, part of me still had a little hope. Hope that all this was wrong, hope that I would see a tiny baby in there with a little flickering heartbeat. We would be the miracle case, it could happen.
Little Man with a Gun in His Hand
This story is not for everyone, Danny isn’t a great hero, but he was real. There’s a lot of groveling, talking and crying. And if you don’t like angst then you will hate this book. But if you feel like taking a chance and reading a different story with a different take on infidelity and a cheating hero that isn’t a villain, then go for it.
After some fun in the sun, we retreated to the house to relax (for what seemed like 2.5 seconds) before moving my bags to the hotel, since I was staying there that evening. My mom read a book to our flower girl, and GM J decided to take a nap...right in the middle of the house. I kid you not - he slept on those cushions for about an hour or so, even with about 10 or more people chatting around him! I wish I could learn that trick...
spring woods something to behold.
That Kenneth did the deed is not an issue. Whether he is culpable is another matter. There is a condition, believe it or not, called homicidal somnambulism and after testing it was discovered that Kenneth was not acting of his own free will and was subsequently found innocent. Sounds incredible but we accept Tourette’s sufferers effing and blinding and most of us will be aware of alien hand syndrome so is it really so incredible what Kenneth did?

Step two is to develop the recipe for the Mother Ale. Using whatever grain bill you'd like, shoot for a target SG of 1.074. The brewing software of your choice is a big help in figuring this out. It keeps the calculator out of it. Once you have the grain bill, the next step is to figure out the pre-boil volumes needed. This will vary from system to system, and with the length of boil used.

...to be overwhelmed. Isn't it? This year has been particularly frantic and frenetic. First, at the start of the month, we traveled to Texas for my niece's college graduation, which was fantastic, but took the first week of December away, so I started out behind. Second, two short stories of mine were published end of November/beginning of December from two different publishers, one in the anthology Dreamspell Nightmares and my story Changing Woman Ways. I've got another story coming out in another anthology soon, plus an article.This means I need to be promoting my new and soon-to-be releases and self promotion is so hard for me! Hmm...perhaps it is for every writer--and a subject for a separate post.

Sooo ... obviously I did not meet my goal of catching up by the end of the year. But one of my resolutions is to be better organized, so getting caught up is a good place to start with that =)
The inaugural Dad 2.0 Summit in Austin gathered bloggers of the paternal persuasion to discuss with each other, marketers and social media mavens the role of the modern father.

The media is putting out a cover story again. The explosion and debris was a Gizeh Intelligence “bell” shaped saucer, shot down by Remiz and Olein. It was targeting the Procyon-Earth shuttle leaving Catalina Island and heading toward a cargo pick-up on the moon, with Kerry Cassidy on board. I am not sure if they were after her, as there were a number of uncompromised white hats on the shuttle, including a very important person I cannot name for his own protection.
Zone C consists of every other part of the UK, where Muslims exist not at all or only in very small numbers, and are of necessity scattered throughout the surrounding population in terms of where they live and work. They do not exist in large enough numbers to dominate neighbourhoods, and cannot seal themselves off from the outside world to any significant extent at all. Zone C, by definition, includes everywhere in the UK outside of Zones A and B, and accounts for the overwhelming majority of the land mass of the country.
I totally intended to have a post a day this week, but needless to say I’ve been busy! So here are a few highlights from the rest of my conference…
I didn't have a lot of books in the house. Not everyone can afford it because books are a luxury item and if you're not so well off you want food on the table first. The library was where I learnt about the world. I read about Ceasar crossing the Rubicon, the battle of Hattin, the witchtrials. I learnt that Afghanistan has been more trouble than it's worth for over two millenia. Even Alexander the Great thought it best just to get on the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Frankly, if one or two politicans had visited their own libraries before commiting to war, a lot of lives would have been saved. It opened the world to me and made me realise how marvellous it all is. We are retreating into parochial mindsets already, shutting down libraries will only speed that process up and all our news and knowledge will become the unfiltered rants of the loud and empty voices.
Then, I used my cheaty method to make his shadow. I'm pretty sure his shadow means six years of sunshine. Or that's what I hope, anyway.
I’ve joked about this for years. I know it’s sadistic, but it cracked me up to tell people I was pregnant, wait a few seconds, and then say, “Just kidding!”
“Why’re they heroes?”

A fun trend in cards is to decorate the envelopes. This provides an extra professional look while maintaining the homemade and crafty appearance. Decorating envelopes can be simple but you need to keep a few things in mind.
Dave is painting my craft room today (hooray - have only waited a year!) so no cards being made. I have a knitting commission that I need to get on with while it's daylight anyway, so I'll be round to visit you all this evening. I'll be back on Tuesday with my PTW card and, at last, some celebratory followers candy!
As you can see, Son is all pleased with "Cenation" (WWE for those who don't know - like I didn't). Nothing keeps you grounded like having a 24 year young man who still believes in Santa and smiles accordingly. He'll smile like that all day, like he always does.
5.JOE JACKSON - Got The Time
This, of course, has led me to this problem: do I or do I not start a new blog for Sophie? Do I write publicly about my endeavors with her, or not?
If this were a TV episode it would begin with the requisite photo montage and a voiceover that says, “Previously on…Sweet Mother.” So, let’s re-cap. I was annoyed with lesbo-land and their common “lesbian lazy susan” approach to dating. As a result, every now and again, I stepped out with one of my straight, lady friends looking for some man-tail. My dearest friend, Rayanne, had just suffered some heartache. I did what any good friend would do and put up a crazy, Craigslist advert seeking some potential man-tail to distract her.

If I engage too strongly, I will end up driving people away. Though the faces remain out of focus still, I need to rely on the other players. Putting too much of a burden on them to the point they simply walk away means the potential rewards they provide also walk away. For the sake of maximizing the rewards, I cannot come on too strong.
Get your act together with the food please....
Is that the most fucked up thing you've ever heard?
Anyway, hope you're all having a happy Friday! Any good plans for the weekend?
Lately, however, I’ve really found comfort in these two philosophies:

This somehow leads to her asking him to be her pretend boyfriend. So previously, Ki Joon and Ah Jung met and agreed that the best way to kill this rumor is for her to explain to his friends that they are not married. So there’s a party and instead of just showing up and playing her part, she decides that she really wants to make it clear to big-headed Ki Joon that she’s not into him. What better way is there to do that than to walk in with a boyfriend?

If Levi is smart, he’ll get a signed agreement with Sunny stating that if they ever breakup and she appears on “Dancing With The Stars,” writes a book, goes on tour, and makes a gazillion dollars, that he gets a cut of the money that will come rolling in. It’s only fair ya know.

As advised I continued the pain killer for one more day and we were able to stay on for two more days, when at that moment our bags were packed for leaving.
Not a lot of writing time there!
At Mio Elementary, we are celebrating March is Reading Month, and our theme is the Olympic Games. We have lots of fun and interesting things planned to spark our students’ interest in and excitement about the upcoming Summer Olympics in London.
Everyone would care. The one thing that always happens when disaster strikes is that people come together to help in whatever way they can. If people need help, they need help. Is that not community?
But, now…I am out of hospital and my bed rest, and will be able to post daily readings again.
What’s interesting about this is that throughout the week prior and during our anniversary I was falling deeper and deeper in love with her. For me, it’d always been a fact, that I loved her and she me. I never really put a lot of thought into it. But for some reason I’ve been much more outwardly cerebral in the last little while and I’d been thinking about her and our life a lot.

As Dave, The Gratitude Guy, I believe my greater purpose is being served when I start becoming a daily reminder to people of the importance of living a life of gratitude. Because when I started this attitude of gratitude, I understood that, by being who I am, I will attract more of what I truly want in my life. Amazing things, some of which you may never thought possible, start to happen. And I just want to share these feelings of love and gratitude with as many people as possible.
The next day, our "team" spent some time listening to the tapes of the previous night's debate, and we found a place where they guy made the statement… sorta. The only problem was that he wasn’t actually saying what we had said he that he had said. In fact, he was really saying just the opposite. But if we started the quote late and stopped it early, then it appeared that he said what we needed him to say. So the plan was to dub the statement to a fresh tape and play it that night, proving that we were right and he was wrong. And thus we could exclaim, to borrow a quote from the old Lady Godiva story, “Horary for our side!”

In the pilot of Justified Raylan has to return to his home town in Kentucky to deal with some Nazis in the area, including an old friend of his he used to work with down the mines. Not sure what it is with FX this season but between this and Sons Of Anarchy Nazi skinheads have made a television resurgence. As you would expect from the man who once embodied Seth Bullock, Raylan has a way with folks and sets about sorting out the problem the only way he knows how – with cool detachment and bottled in anger.
I have three very passionate children. I get the privilege of having a front row seat to several tantrums every day. In every situation, which ever child is throwing the tantrum has determined to be unrelenting until the situation turns to his or her favor. Usually my children can not see that their way will not be best. Their obsession has blinded them. Yet, I do admire them for their enthusiasm. They never give up. Unrelenting Obsession.
Hi Folks! News moves so fast. Here’s a story I was going to post tomorrow, but here it is today — complete with an update that just came in!
4. i don’t write about kids. although i have kids, i’ve only written about them in 4 of over 200 posts. since 43.9% of all FP are about the wonderful, cutsey, annoying things that your special little cherubs did during playtime, i will never be FB because i don’t think my kids are so special that their every juice spill is subconscious art.

In Daegu, however, such was not the case – at least on the men’s side of the ledger. As a matter of fact, when the smoke cleared, we had two sprinters make sprint finals – Walter Dix in the 100 & 200, and LaShawn Merritt in the – and only one gold medal from our male sprint crew with Merritt’s come from behind win in the 4x4.
WW: You’ve self-published a couple of books on Kindle – what kind of book do you think does well published by this route?
Yep, a red, and a Bordeaux at that, generously offered by a friend of Bob's. Popped and poured, this really should have been decanted a bit, but it was rather nice and reminded me why I used to like Bordeaux so much. Notes of band-aid, funk, dark plums/cherries and soft wood aspects held your attention. The palate was light, with some sweet red fruit still fighting for survival (storage might have been an issue, we weren't sure), herbs, and a nice, balanced finish. Not bad, and a welcome reprieve from all the whites.
So Mowat advocates making active transportation opportunities (cycling, walking, and transit) easy choices for urban residents and says this has to be a key focus of public health departments. That includes “changes in the way we lay out our roads” and making cities walkable.

What is not being reported is the jet was on a flase flag mission to attack Langley and blame it on Iran. The Plejarans knew of this and Sub Commander Olein was sent to stop the false flag.
I think this is exactly what applies to having a character be “universal.” In other words–you can just say “I’m going to write a universal character!” but rather that what you have to do is write a character that is so true to him- or herself and so realistic that people will then recognize themselves (or at least aspects of themselves) in that character–thereby creating the universality.
The origins of the story are murky. What the press reported was that the SFPD acted on a tip from the FBI, which was supposedly concerned about files on the Nation of Islam that were stolen from its local office, and arrested Gerard, who allegedly had done the pilfering. In Gerard's computer they found files on more than 7,000 individuals, many of them Arab-Americans, as well as information on hundreds of left-to-liberal organizations filed by Gerard as "pinko". In his locker, they found a black executioner's hood, a number of photos of dark-skinned men bound and blindfolded, CIA manuals, a secret document on interrogation techniques, stamped "secret" and referring to El Salvador, and numerous passports and IDs in a variety of names, all with his picture.
Immediately as I read I remembered that Katie MacAlister’s books have flare and a little quirk to them. She is not the normal romance writer of women in trouble and they need men to save them which is great but at times it can be a little hard to get into. The book I thought to try was A Girl’s Guide To Vampires which is in the series of Dark One.

At the finish up there's just enough of a hop-bite present to prevent anyone mistaking it for alcoholic porridge-water, though it's still hard to shake the sensation of supping some kind of breakfast cereal or nutritious dietary supplement for invalids.

Now, for each environmental scenario that might push the dog more towards an over all fearful disposition, the cup gets more full. Each "stress" added pushes the dog towards the top of the cup, towards the threshold (spilling over the cup = threshold = fearful dog).

To tell you guys the truth, of course the story is great, with its complications about the characters and the reincarnation stuff that’s going on with Luce, I just thought that the story is much of a cliche. However, I’d like to give it a chance, especially because the story is growing more intense as it goes. Don’t get me wrong, I like the story. It isn’t predictable, that I can assure you, which I really like. And you’ll keep on reading it, you will never actually notice that you already finish it. Then, there’s the cliffhanger. Damn! =)) With its heart-felt, bound-to-be-forever romantic relationship of Luce and Daniel, it was a joy reading it. Especially now that the demons and angels are on a truce just to save Luce. Some characters are added to the story, one of which is Miles, Luce’s Shoreline friend who admitted that he loves Luce, and lucky for him, Luce is having the rough time processing if she really wants to be with Daniel, inclusive of unbelievable complications. Luce is yet to find who she really is. The novel provided some action as well. The demons and angels fighting together against the Outcasts. Some adrenaline to balance the romantic atmosphere, eh?

Instead, we suggest readers focus on alternative Internet news sources such as the two Swedish-based links below. It is for this reason, we encourage other citizen journalists in other countries, to develop similar news blogs designed to expose real truths without carrying the baggage of a Marxist-inspired “political-correct” news slant, nor being weighted down with fear-mongering “racist” and “anti-semitic” labels for simply exposing the Truth.
My thoughts: It wasn’t that bad! Definitely still annoyed throughout the whole book but I thought this book was alright. An easy read.
Kynaston, the 2006 and 2008 MSA Asphalt Rally Champion, had hoped to begin his 2010 season on a strong note but an incorrect tyre choice on the opening stage of the Llandovery based rally cost the Devon driver dearly. 27 seconds were lost on that first 12 mile test and Kynaston was aware that he would have to push hard over the remaining five stages to claw back the advantage.

Long story short – I was treated through CBT, I did the whole graduated exposure thing (small incremental trips with my walking bag bristling with a panoply of safety behaviours: maps, water bottle, comfort books and, for some reason, fucking emory boards) and recovered to the point where I can again work full time and have a full social life. Still, there is some fear around the edges. When I walk up to town through Oxford Road there is this one fucker of a road that is difficult to cross and makes me panic a little. Booth Street East is my mortal enemy.

Investigations are on into the deaths of hundreds of dolphins that washed up on the northern coast of Peru. Around 877 carcasses of dolphins and porpoises were found on Peruvian beaches in two and half months. Peruvian officials and environmentalists are trying to unravel the mystery behind the phenomenon.
I think it would be the height of naivety and the worst example of the very sort of ethnocentrism that these types are wont to condemn to insist that Scripture, in order to be legitimate, must unconditionally condemn as evil all that they condemn as evil. The fact of the matter is that slavery was at that point in time the way of the entire world. The idea that it is absolutely and unconditionally evil in every possible manifestation did not exist, nor does it exist in many places in the world today.

Not only is the answer to this question no, it is vital to understand that this would be one of the worst conceivable outcomes for European peoples, because it would solve nothing while giving the impression of having solved everything. Here we will demonstrate why this would be the case.

My other major gripe was with the third act, more specifically the last 20-or-so minutes; the ending didn’t sit well with me. It felt forced, and rushed, and didn’t bring things to a satisfying conclusion. The tone became dramatically more serious and simply did not flow with the first hour and change of the film.
Among other things, of course (ie, work, and all of the crap that is going on there--it is seriously driving me crazy). The end of my first pregnancy was decidedly placid compared to all I have going on right now. Given that I was living at my MIL's house back then, 1.5 hours from my doctor and hospital, and in the middle of renovating my house at that point, that's really saying something.
So here are my answers to the questions:

Ashley was a typical child from a upper-class home, except for her inborn anger. The child of well-to-do parents, and the youngest of two children, Ashley felt ignored and shunned by her parents and friends. She and her sister wanted for nothing growing up – even love. Raised chiefly by her nanny, she still always had all that a young girl could possibly want or need. Although her parents loved their daughters unconditionally, they expected great things of them. Success for their children was utmost in their minds. They made all efforts to see that the girls had the best education and care growing up.
And then it was time to go and get the kids from the bus. And CPT was home from work early for Family Day! It was a miracle! hehe :) He got ready for Military skate night, and I headed to the bus.

Late last year, I got an Adobe Photoshop CS5 installer from a friend and discovered this very amazing feature that they have— the mixer brush tool. I love to paint and it is something that I occasionally do when there are projects before in high school since they were all required, so I have an excuse to buy the necessary materials. But as of the moment, I’m having an issue about the money and time spent to create a masterpiece and also it’s not one of my priorities now since I’m at the peak of my college life. So as to being resourceful, I used the software as an instrument to at least continue what I love to do.

I realize a lot of people take study breaks and watch television. This makes no sense to me. When I was in college, neither I nor any of my roommates watched TV. Of course, we didn’t have one in our apartment, so that makes a difference. We were a bunch of stress cleaners—so we’d burn off our nervous anxiety with work. It went something like this. I had an exam in Elizabethan literature and I had to memorize 50 sonnets—yes, 50. So I’d take a break and scrub the shower with a toothbrush. Death to mold and mildew. My roommate needed a break from Boolean Algebra—she mopped the bathroom and kitchen floors on her hands and knees. Another roommate had a nasty Econ exam, she vacuumed the floors, dusted every surface, and scrubbed the counters. Roommate #4 bleached everything. By the end of finals, our apartment was so clean you could eat off the floor. Probably even the toilet lid (though that’s too gross to contemplate), though all the bleach and ammonia might make your eyes water or poison you.

The children of Mbari went to chief Mutema of the tribe of Chivero. Their mutupo was Shava and their chidawo Mwendamberi. The children of Mbari begged the army of Chief Mutema to help them to fight against Chiweshe. Chief Mutema agreed and he called many people to fight against Chiweshe. Chiweshe when he heard that was afraid and he told his son-in-law Mhembere. Mhembere told Chiweshe to call his people. When they were gathered Mhembere took the medicine from his gona and mixed it with porridge and gave it to Chiweshe and his people. Then Mhembere took the medicine from his gona and put it in the fire saying, “if we go to fight Chief Mutema are we going to conquer him?” He threw the medicine into the fire and the smoke pointed to Chief Mutema. Mhembere said to Chiweshe, ‘Let us go and fight against Chief Mutema for we are going to conquer him.” Then Mhembere led Chiweshe and his people to fight Chief Mutema. When they met they fought on a hill called Tsikwi (Avondale). Chief Mutema was killed with a spear by Mhembere and many of his people were killed and some ran away.

I have been an idiot at scheduling and remembering appointments lately, and found out four days ago that I had scheduled back-to-back doctor’s appointments for Gideon and me at 9:00 and 9:20 on the ONE day that Mr. Gore could not accompany us. I was left with the following options: cancel the appointments and reschedule, leave Rebekah with her Grandmother and take Gideon alone, or take Rebekah, Grandmother and Gideon to the doctor with me. Canceling would involve picking up the phone, taking Gideon alone would be risky indeed (for many reasons), which left me with the third and final option: a family field-trip to the doctor.

In the post Christmas lull, we pepped ourselves up with a Good Beer Guide led trip to Salisbury, where, as well as getting engaged (yay!) we made our way round the historical streets and Cathedral, and all the pubs in the guide, as well as many that should be. The glorious Village Freehouse is the sort of pub that you want to move house (and city) to be near to; I have major pub envy of those locals. Lots of Hogsback beer drunk, we made our way back to London with the warm glow of love and the buzz of yet another storming Good Beer Guide trip. It was surely meant to be.

Edamame! You know those little beans that come out when you eat out at a Japanese bar or restaurant? Those amazing little green, salty, savory, and very healthy snack? Love them as much as I do? Good news! They aren’t just restricted to being eaten whole and boiled. At the restaurant I work at, we serve an edamame horseradish purée with our salmon dish. Our salmon dish is served with the purée, salsify, and a ginger-soy emulsion foam.

Meanwhile, some of the range including pockets went on sale in the USA. Dick's complained that the range was off-field wear and Miss Jackson recognized that the pockets involved (eg an iPod pocket on the sleeve) were not sufficiently prominent and might go unnoticed. As the pocketless shirts were also now going on sale, Miss Jackson purported to sign a variation of the Hudson licence which would enable them to sell specific types of shorts and shirts without pockets that might otherwise, at least arguably, be considered on-field wear. Not long afterwards, Miss Jackson was dismissed from Umbro US for unrelated reasons.

Indeed he goes further than this, suggesting that true strength is only to be found in these actions. Someone who appears to have power (strength) and does not use it in fact does not have that power (strength) in the first place. Unless it is exercised strength only exists as a label in language. The popular (slave-)morality he says wrongly separates having strength from the action of strength. Nietzsche argues that this is not possible. “…there is no ‘being’ behind doing,… ‘the doer’ is a mere appendage to the action. The action is everything.”

But first lets ask what made the “repugnant bastards” do it? The answer is in the video: “... at the end of the day, this is what we think of integration.”, said one actor. They are unhappy about the integration policy by the government, that forces students from minority groups to integrate with the majority Black groups in campus dorms. Cloaked under “nation building”, this policy is actually deliberately intended to indirectly alienate and drive away the minorities from these institutions. None of the racial groups, especially the majority Black groups want this integration and where it has been implemented, unsurprisingly it has been to the detriment of the minorities, where there has been serious intimidation and abuse (even rape) of members of the minority groups. Hence the reactive petty racist protest by these White students.

So anyone who hasn’t tried boba should. You won’t be disappointed.

“But what goes up can usually come down, and love bank balances are no exception. As most married couples have discovered, the feeling of romantic love is much more fragile than originally thought. And if Love Bank balances drop below the romantic love threshold, a couple not only lose their feeling of passion for each other, but they lose their instinct to make each other happy. What was once effortless now becomes awkward, and even repulsive. Instead of the look of love, couples have the look of apathy. And without love, a husband and wife no longer want to spend their lives together. Instead, they start thinking of divorce, or at least living their lives apart from one another. It should be obvious to you by now that the Love Bank is an extremely important concept in marriage. If you want your instincts and emotions to support your marriage you must keep your Love Bank accounts over the romantic love threshold.”

I wrote about Bajaj a couple of weeks ago on my blog. (Pronunciation is bah-j-eye) Back then I hadn’t tried Bajaj yet. This past Sunday, I went to KOI Restaurant and Gallery and on the way home, I decided to take Bajaj. I met two expats last week who take Bajaj, so that triggered my interest to take Bajaj. As a foreigner it is a bit intimidating as it is a small ride basically on the back of a motorcycle and you don’t see many expats ride them. I was more concerned about the safety, but many Indonesians take it, plus I figured if I ride it on the day when there are not many cars on the street and from the place not far from where we live, it should be okay.

This division seems like a foregone conclusion, as on paper the talent gap between Detroit and the field is massive. The Tigers will still win it, but any consistence in offensive production from the Indians could keep them in the race, especially if Ubaldo Jiminez regains some of his ace form. The Tigers still face questions of consistency in the rotation after Justin Verlander (although Doug Fister could be the solid two that Rick Porcello and Max Scherzer have been aiming to be) and their offense might not be the beast that everyone is predicting. Prince Fielder will still produce, but his numbers are going to take a hit in the spacious confines of Comerica Park. And the impact of Miguel Cabrera’s move to third base is still unknown; the defensive hit alone will likely hamper the pitching staff. Past these two mashers, there’s a lot of incosistence and what if’s in the rest of the offense, enough that Cleveland’s vaunted youngsters could give them fits. A return to form for Shin-Soo Choo and continued improvement from Asdrubal Cabrera will go a long way toward making sure that Carlos Santana doesn’t have to shoulder the burden himself. If the Shelley Duncan, Casey Kotchman, Jack Hannahan/Lonnie Chisenhall triumvirate can be better than league average, then

I can’t imagine what life would be like if I had left Norfolk right after high school, or even at an earlier age. Sure I still have time to experiment and see what it is like (I can start saving now for a trip to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil), but I feel part of my true identity would be left behind. I would just be another stranger on the sidewalk, making his way through the maze called life. To me, that would be strange . For now let’s keep it local.

Practics requires that we apply network ethics. And this is why I think it is possible to say that having OOO and SR deal with racism before frogs is because of a philosophical system of value which is flat, immanent, and not classicly anthropocentric.

Seeing how well that turned out gave me an idea. Marion was still eager to work and I had run out of good splash images of his stories to recreate. I asked whether he'd consider recreating some other covers for me, in the manner of the Rawhide Kid cover, although they would be "straight" recreations. Marion thought this fine and we decided the manner of the recreation would be not trying to exactly copy the original artist in question line for line, but instead treat it as if Marion was "inking" the work in his own style over the other artist's pencils. With this idea set, Marion set out to work. I chose some of my favorite cover images and at the age of 89, Marion produced these:

I don’t know why I remember some things but not others. Perhaps I remember the snow because it was unusual and so exciting. We remember things that are outside the routine. Perhaps the puzzle of who killed the pond life is the key to why I remember those other events, the unresolved nature of it all. Does it matter who actually did it? Perhaps there was a conspiracy of silence and everyone but me knew who did the deed so for them the day falls into the deep well of forgetfulness.

1. (C) SUMMARY. PolOff and PolAsst's trip to Limpopo Province on 24 April confirmed press reports that Zuma's camp has made inroads in gaining provincial support for Zuma as ANC President, but the province remains split and difficult to call. As expected, Zuma's supporters were fervent but short on substance, never making a case for what Zuma would bring to the party as ANC President. Instead, they emphasized that the ANC as an institution is greater than the sum of its members, dismissing the importance of leadership in the process. END SUMMARY.

Disposable menstrual pads, in my opinion, are a product of the underworld. They are so uncomfortable, it’s no wonder I resorted to tampons for so many years! They bunch up, the sticky part sticks where it shouldn’t, they heat up to uncomfortable temperatures, they do not “breathe” no matter what the label says, they create a lot of embarrassing trash, and they “rustle” when you move around. I tried wearing disposable pads for one period and gave up. They felt like wearing a diaper…which actually made me feel bad for diapering my son with disposable diapers for nine months–there is no way they could be more comfortable than cloth!

FDR had a lifelong affection for pets. His best-known was Fala, a Scottish terrier given to him by his cousin, Daisy Suckley, in 1940. Fala became Roosevelt’s constant companion and the most famous dog in America. He appeared in newspapers, cartoons, books, and films. Fala often accompanied FDR on trips. One trip to Alaska sparked a famous political debate during the 1944 presidential election campaign. Republicans falsely claimed that Fala had been mistakenly left behind on an Alaskan island and that FDR had ordered a destroyer to retrieve him. Roosevelt disarmed his critics in a celebrated speech. Fala’s frugal “Scotch soul was furious,” FDR reported, at allegations that taxpayer dollars were spent to rescue him.

Whatever your views on Sex Work VS Prostitution, I am totally appalled that the term Sex Work would be connected to teenagers. People who are not yet legally old enough to even make a decision to be in prostitution. If the thinking is that the term sex work is a more legitimate and appropriate term for prostitution, then by connecting it to teenagers, a population of people who still need permission to go on school trips, we have legitimized teenage prostitution. Recognizing the sexual exploitation of children is a major problem in Cape Town which often goes unaddressed. When you put the words teenager and sex worker together, you have actually undermined the need for assistance and exit strategies to be made available for children in prostitution. You are normalizing a situation that should never be made normal.

The standard edition of the album closes with “Good Riddance (Time of Your Life),” which feels like the perfect bookend to Awesome As F**k. As the lyrics suggest I “had the time of my life” enjoying this album. If that’s not enough, the album includes a DVD with concert footage from the Saitama Super Arena in Saitama, Japan. Talk about an extra hour of awesomeness! Awesome As F**k is easily one of my favorite albums of the year and in my opinion the best live album of 2011! I wish more albums were filled with so many goodies.

This retreat doesn't offer the solace that he might have hoped for. Not only is there the slightly fractious relationship between father and daughter but in a moment of shocking violence the two of them are subjected to an ordeal that further polarises their positions as well as forcing the reader to confront an uncomfortable image of the new South Africa. As a reviewer I might chose to skirt around the details of the incident in order to avoid spoilers but Coetzee keeps things unclear by placing Lurie in a different room to his daughter as she endures what he presumes to be rape by one or all of the three (black) men who attack them in their home. Lucy's refusal to discuss what actually happened or seek any recourse to the law leaves Lurie baffled and frustrated but she is quite clear about her stance.

Joey narrates, "I had just about give up all hope, when I saw Albert running toward me through the crowd, his face red with exertion. The band had stopped playing , and the entire village looked on as he came up to me and put his arms around my neck." Realizing he cannot stop his father from seeling Joey, Albert begs Captain Nicholls to let him ride Joey in the war, but the captain refuses. Joey is too young for the war -- to enlist, you have to be seventeen.
There are those who believe that when folks become aware of the presence of a deceased loved one, God is somehow giving them a sign that the person they miss is safe with God. I would never say that God doesn’t do something or couldn’t do something, and that is certainly in line with something a loving, gracious God might do. This is particularly true when that presence is experienced in a dream, as there are many examples in Scripture of God communicating with people in their dreams.
They take me to the x-ray room and we start with the hand. That was not fun - I could not get my ring or pinky finger to touch my thumb like the x-ray tech wanted me to - they had to actually move it for me. Luckily at this point the ice Judd Nelson had gotten me was kicking in so I was pretty numb to being moved around - but it still hurt pretty badly. Next came the leg x-rays. I was so swollen it was incredibly hard to move from the bed to the x-ray table. They took the x-rays of my ankle, my knee, my hip and pelvis as well as a few shots of my ankle to my knee - all from different angles. I almost passed out a few times. It was excruciating. I did my best to focus on staying quiet and just moving the way they needed me to without passing out. I know there were tears pouring down my face and they were actually repelled at how bad the sprain looked. They were being very careful with how they touched me and moved me around. The bump on the side of the ankle that is naturally there was swollen out and people kept commenting that it looked like I actually had two of those bone bumps on one side. Then we got me back onto the bed and wheeled me back to the emergency room.

In our house it started, consciously at least, with asking the kid to choose his socks every day. We thought we were quite brilliant with this, except of course, our son has absolutely no interest in socks. Couldn’t give a rats which socks, and has been persistantly removing all socks ever since he was able. Still can’t get him to show any interest in socks. He does choose shoes though, we give him two options that are ok (unless there’s some particular reason for a particular choice, in which case we make it for him and tell him why it’s a gumboots day – some days, shock horror, we take him outside when the weather is less than clement and to places without paving!). The other essential component of teaching kids to walk, ride a bike, or catch public transport alone is to walk, ride a bike or catch public transport with them lots of times. It’s not about setting kids loose, it’s about teaching them how to cope with every day things. It’s rather scary to see how many people seem to be horrified at the idea of letting a kid of ten or eleven walk to the park alone (any park, ever, no matter how safe the neighbourhood, or how close to home it might be) but have no problem with teaching that same kid to drive at sixteen.

Its almost hard to believe that I am a 27 years old (28 in August) mother to THREE amazing children. I must confess, when I was younger I always said I would never have children. I didn't want kids... I didn't even really like kids! *sigh* To be fair I also said I would never get married either or sleep in the same bed with my husband if I did happen to get married. Yet here I am... A married mother of three, (who does in fact sleep in the same bed as her husband) with a changed heart. Such a big love for my family and life - Just as it is - Just as I said I'd never have.
Bradley named Fort Worth defense attorney Lance Evans to replace Kerrigan, but Evans noted that this resulted in a committee made up entirely of new appointees.

One thing that made me hesitate about this new job is the drive. I've never really had to drive to work before here, besides once a week to give lessons, but this is more frequent and a slightly longer drive involving the highway. However, a nice "bonus" of needing to drive to work is the radio. It's about a 20 minute trip, and sometimes I'm lucky and happen to catch a segment on France Culture from the beginning and can listen to the whole thing.
Anyway, what am I saying, P&Q Rangers? It’s supposed to be a good week. It’s the unofficial beginning of summer, the Red Sox are back at around .500, and it’s time to announce the winner of our Guilty Pleasure Movies contest.

There should also be internal and external conflicts. Your character's flaws and nuances will inform how they react to the external conflict, but it's through the internal conflict that they grow. Yep, remember the *promise* you made to the reader in the opening... you promised the reader that the character would grow. And it's through the solving of the conflict that she will do this.
At the same time, United’s away form has been similarly impressive this season with statistics showing that they lead the Premier League in the number of away wins (12 out of 17 games), goals conceded (just 13) and points gained (39), while only City have managed the same number of goals scored (36).

JC: I needed Anne to get well so that Fitzwilliam could woo her. Her illness had to be one that was caused by her environment, rather than some chronic disease. It had to be something Regency science would not recognize, but we would. It also gave me the chance to put some light moments in the book. I won’t say much more, but a character’s name gave me the inspiration.

Do we need Queen of Teen? After all the Romantic Novelists Association have just introduced a YA award, won for the first time by debut author Caroline Green for her book Dark Ride. Teen authors are usually over-represented on shortlists for the Costa Book Award, the Carnegie Medal and the Branford Boase. But, since the demise of the Booktrust Teenage Prize, the only other national award specifically for teen books that I can think of is the older age section of the UKLA award. The shortlist, out this week, is dominated by Kings of Teen - Kevin, Phil, Andy, Kenneth and Carnegie-winning Patrick, all writing about boys (in fact, one book is called iBoy, another is Half Brother and yet another includes a boy’s name, Billy) The only woman author is Lindsey Barraclough, author of Long Larkin.

I know our relationship is not perfect, and we’ll always have to work harder to maintain it than we do with other family members. I know we’ll always need to err on the cautious side when confronting an issue and take extra care as to not wound one another. Because although we have moved forward, we still have scars, and our relationship will always need to be nurtured.

Having you by my side makes me the happiest.
Recall Willis’ proposal for the genre of Ps. 2, which includes (1) a “…threat of impending conflict…(vv. 1-3), (2) …affirmations of certainty by the speaker that he (and his comrades) will prevail (vv. 4, 6, 8-9); and (3) warnings to the enemy that they will be defeated if they do not surrender…”[25] It is not difficult to imagine why the New Testament authors returned to the ideas of procreation and individual sonship found in Ps. 2; nor is it difficult to understand how they applied the text to Jesus’ resurrection from the dead. His victory over death was not only a prime example of triumph in the midst of turmoil, but also the point at which Yahweh conferred upon him universal dominion (i.e. Sonship). There is a message here that rings true even still today. We might look around and see the nations conspiring and plotting in vain while kings of the earth set themselves against Yahweh and his anointed. The Psalmist assures us that he who sits in the heavens laughs because he has poured out his king on Zion and said to him, “You are my son; today I have begotten you.”

I was interested in Mao, and somewhat less in Chou, and the Gang of Four I remember, but now I find China slightly distasteful — communist moralising combined with capitalist greed, even worse than Russia, where at least they have abandoned the pretence. But padding out pet food with melamine to enhance the protein levels seemed to me the most unscrupulous capitalist trick of all, and made me lose all interest in Chinese trade, Chinese goods, or even China itself.

Don't believe it. It's nothing more than an intimidation tactic intended to frighten you or shut you up. There's no such thing as a "master blacklist." Period. Nor can an agent or editor singlehandedly blacken a writer's name throughout the industry--nor is it likely that they'd care enough to bother. Keep in mind also that the people who typically threaten blacklisting--the fee-chargers, the amateurs--are not actually part of the publishing industry, and haven't the connections or the credibility to blacklist anyone, even if they wanted to.

Bataan fishermen used to eat pawikan or the big turtles that they caught on sea. The Philippine pawikans are: 1) the green turtle which is colored brown, 2) the olive ridley and 3) the hawksbill with mouth like hawks bill. My experience with these turtles and knowing the hard process for them to survive made me feel guilty of once tasting their eggs. Pawikan eggs were in demand as aphrodisiacs and were sold like ordinary commodity until we learned how to value these endangered species.

When it comes to civil nuclear power, civil reactors of various designs, including MOX, France takes some beating. France is extremely nuclear orientated in its energy production and was quite probably a driving force behind the EU Energy Plan that runs to 2050 and envisages a large increase in nuclear power facilities across the continent. Whether events in Japan will change some of the proposed atomic generation to more conventional energy production around the continent we shall see. Given statements from Ukraine, the Czech Republic and Estonia since the Japanese disaster it seems unlikely plans will change greatly.

There was an old farmhouse that, until it was torn down a few years ago, stood in the middle of a three-acre plot of land in Afton, Wyoming. At the time, the land belonged to my wife's grandparents, who had purchased the otherwise barren expanse in the spring of 1982 with the intent of building a home on the northwest edge of the property closest to the main road. The home was built, the perimeter fenced, and the rest of the land kept for the horses they owned. After toying with the idea of renovating the sixty- year-old farmhouse and turning it into a guest cottage, they decided against it and now only used it for additional storage space.

Bonnie: Set dressing. I used objects that my grandmother or mother owned to decorate Ruthie’s grandmother’s apartment; objects that felt homey and familiar. Though her neighbors might be a bit bohemian, I saw Ruthie’s grandmother as more traditional, and so she has traditional objects in her kitchen and living room. She even has a Maxfield Parrish print over the sofa. I suppose that unconsciously I selected objects that might be interpreted as comforting. After all Grandma is in the hospital.

In late 2010, I started basic tutorials on CAD rendering for all years on the product design course. These focused on general aspects, such as overall style and resolution, which were relevant for any render engine. The purpose was to test whether, organised and student-led CAD rendering tutorials could be effective. Later, these tutorials began to focus more heavily on Maxwell Render as interest continued to increase. It quickly became obvious that the course would have to purchase some academic licenses of the software in order for tutoring to continue.

Well, that's not entirely accurate. Everything I write is personal really, in the sense it's important to me and draws heavily on my personal experiences and background.

The requirement in section 112(e)(4) to determine rates is logical in that the two licenses involve different rights. The section 112 statutory license applies to reproductions, while the section 114 statutory license applies to public performances. Moreover, the beneficiaries of the section 114 license are not identical to the beneficiaries of the section 112 license. Royalties collected under section 114 are paid to the performers and the copyright owners of the sound recordings, i.e., usually the record companies; whereas, the royalties collected pursuant to the section 112 license are not paid to performers. Without separate rates for both the section 114 and 112 licenses, SoundExchange is unable to allocate properly the funds it collects as the
Wondering if horticultural societies have become a scarce commodity I googled, pages and pages appeared based all over the country and some dating back to the early nineteenth century.

It is thus not surprising that sceptics and unbelievers cannot relate to words such as “Satan” or “antichrist” when subjects pertaining to world chaos, terrorism, and/or world domination crops up. One cannot even introduce the words “God” or “Jesus Christ” into conversations anymore without triggering-off severe reactions of agitation. This is already an indication that there’s a new kind of hatred brewing towards Christians in general (spurred on by the main stream media) – so much so, that some people will retaliate with such outward aggression that they won’t hesitate to use the Lord’s Name in vain, with absolutely no concern who they’re offending. (See in this regard - Exodus 20: 7, Deuteronomy 5: 11, Psalms 139: 20, and Proverbs 30: 9)
Mr. BURGOYNE asked the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he is aware that the action which his predecessor felt compelled to take in connection with the abandoned boxing contest between Jack Johnson and Bombardier Wells has had the effect of causing ground landlords and lessees of many halls in London to refuse to allow legitimate boxing matches to be decided at their premises

However, just like any other commercial food product, it is important to check the ingredients- especially if you have multiple food allergies. You might think something labeled as "almond milk" is simply milk from almonds, and nothing more. But once you stop and think about it, you will soon realize that is simply not possible. Every commercial product must add compounds for stability during manufacturing, transport, shelf display, and ultimately, to keep it "fresh" once it gets to your kitchen.

Jennifer Lawrence: When I was playing Mystique in X-Men, I remember thinking, If I'm going to be naked in paint in front of the entire world, I'm going to look like a woman. I'm going to have curves and have boobs and have a butt. Because girls are going to look at that, and if I look like a scarecrow, they are going to think, Oh, that's normal. It's not normal. I'm just so sick of these young girls with diets. I remember when I was 13 and it was cool to pretend to have an eating disorder because there were rumors that Lindsay Lohan and Nicole Richie were anorexic. I thought it was crazy. I went home and told my mom, "Nobody's eating bread--I just had to finish everyone's burgers." I think it's really important for girls to have people to look up to and feel good about themselves.
On Ashfield Road, the mist was rising and the clouds were flirting with the last rays of sun. (this picture is of a sunny evening!) The road wound through the fluffing, oozing greenness. Trisha remembered to open the moon roof and the windows stopped fogging up. We were inundated with the moist humusy air. A hot humid night in mid to late summer is the most interestingly scented place! The ferns and weeds on the side of the road, the swamps, the horsey smell of the farm of the percherons, mold, flowers~loamy fertile odors.
I think Sofia Coppola’s sofa from House & Garden is what started my fascination.
We, therefore, need to abolish the Lords, consigning the Parliament Acts to history, where they belong at the same time, and replace it with a wholly elected second chamber with the power of veto over the Commons, unless both sides can get together and work out a compromise – which is essentially what happens with the Senate and Congress in the US.
Enough ranting.

In all, two-thirds of the IoMs money comes from government sources, several of which are military and “homeland security” related. What this reveals is that various government agencies function as “shell companies” to funnel money into the IoM. More than five percent of the IoM’s funding comes from the Department of Defense, and a further 3.6% comes from the Department of Homeland Security.

We all were enjoying a pleasant spring evening on the back porch of their lovely home. My wife was using her iPhone. My sister-in-law toyed with her iPad. My brother and I each were surfing around on our MacBook Pro laptops.
In a statement published on the BNP’s website, Mr Griffin said that the party would have to adapt or die, even though amending its constitution would “stick in the craw of all dedicated nationalists”. The party is considering the change in light of an injunction being sought by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which claims that the BNP’s membership rules breach the Race Relations Act.
You don't have to object to the new security measures to object to this labeling as extremists peaceful American citizens who are exercising their Constitutional rights. As citizens of this country, we have the right to object to unreasonable searches. And we have the right not only to disagree with but to peacefully protest the actions of our government.

There is an obvious distinction here. That distinction is how the money that being spent is made. I know for a liberal like Singer, who clearly sees money as evil (A true “Bertram Scudder”) (note I say “a liberal like Singer” so don’t come shouting at me, “I’m a liberal and I DON’T think money is evil!” Clearly you aren’t like Singer then.), would find it difficult to understand the difference between money that is made ethically and money that is obtained by selling a child to have his organ’s harvested on the black market.

NEWSFLASH! No one is perfect. Nobody. Not even you. We all have our flaws, and love is about taking someone’s flaws and all. Unfortunately, a lot of modern day relationship problems stem from seemingly petty irritations – toothpaste caps left off, dirty socks on the floor, dishes in the sink. When you move past that first flush of love, the habits that seemed cute to begin with can begin to grate.
Leaving them either for 10 minutes or 10 days, is never an easy thing to do. And to give myself some peace of mind, I have created some tools that provide the one caring my for loves, the information necessary to be successful and safe.

Tuesdays walk around the local side streets, (half a portion of chips in hand) was more entertaining than usual. As I sauntered along, lost in my own thoughts, a resident opened his garage door, and drove out… on a farm tractor! Not quite what I was expecting in a build up residential area.
"...On several occasions the Spirit impressed on me that the church should not unnecessarily 'hinder' those who had experienced the power of baptism through the grace and authority of Jesus Christ from responding to the Spirit guiding them to membership.The NCC report, published here, makes clear that the NCC is letting the CofChrist join because they believe the CofChrist is sufficiently far from its historical Restoration roots.
Other than that, my weekend consisted of....you guessed it...studying!! I have a feeling the rest of my weekends until school is done will be filled with lots of studying, and lots of Starbucks time. Thank goodness I have a great boyfriend who knows how to make me smile after lots of studying...
Imagine my surprise when Ruby and I pulled up in front of the house and two big swans passed low overhead. Both adults had followed us to the house and when we stopped at the house they circled several times in formation. They were just flying above the roof of the house and a couple times they rode the air currents around the end of the house, almost playfully. It reminded me of when the ravens would ride the current off the end of the house,diving and playing with each other. The swans were riding the currents and twice the female acted like she was going to grab the male's tail, like they do when chasing other swans out of their territory, often trying to pull them out of the air. I have seen a few individuals loose tail feathers if they weren't quick enough to dodge or pull away from the attacker. Once these swans seemed sure that we were not going any further, they flew off going up river away from where the cygnets had been left.
Served from the oven, the Lamb and Potatoes were placed in the centre of the table with serving spoon, fork and tongs. The Lamb had benefited from every minute of its 7 hours, the meet falling from the bone. The potatoes were the standout, crisp with a rich onion taste from white onions reduced to almost puree. I could order this on its own, although I don't think my belt has enough notches to cope.
When I was a kid, I preferred writing on paper (because personal computers weren’t invented yet, and when it was finally on the market, I was still attached to paper). I switched to writing on the computer when I entered college. School work like term papers were easier to do on the computer especially when I was cramming.
Hutcherson is very focused on gay rights, in part because he lost two uncles to HIV while he was too young to really get to know them. He also credits his mother with helping establish his sense of activism and advocacy.
After that, the harder part: adding the ribbon. I found that it was easier to do the ribbon if I left the backing of the frame off. It also took a bit of wriggling to get the ribbon through the 1/4" holes and then some adjusting to get the ribbon to tie well enough.
Yep. Hockey season is in full swing. The Pittsburgh Penguins had a rough go of it for a while, sustaining a 6-game losing streak, but stormed back with seven straight wins before the All-Star break. It’s amazing that they can play so well and win so much with all the devasting injuries the hockey gods have dealt them. Sid Crosby, the best player in all of hockey, played only a few games before suffering a recurrence of concussion symptoms, and no one knows when he will be back in the line-up. Kris Letang, the Pens all-star defenseman, was out for weeks and weeks with a concussion, but he’s finally returned to the line-up and is playing so well that he was invited to the All-Star game. But Jordan Staal is still out with a knee injury after missing half of last season with a foot injury he suffered during the playoffs of the season before that. And many other players have missed a significant number of games this season due to injuries. Injuries are a part of the game. Although the Penguins have suffered far more than their share of injuries, the team has continued to play pretty well thanks in part to all the talent they can bring up from their AHL affiliate, the Wilkes Barre-Scranton Penguins, aka, the Baby Pens. The Baby Pens play the same system of hockey that the Pens use, so when players are called up, they fit right in.

Upon removal of the three passengers, all correctional staff made several attempts to tip the vehicle on its side to free the passenger trapped underneath; however, the vehicle was too heavy. They summoned more help from civilians on the scene, making it possible to tip the vehicle and remove the trapped passenger. Sgt Ayala immediately started life saving techniques to stabilize the passenger until the emergency life flight medical personnel arrived.
I’m planning this week around a 90 mile stretch in the route that doesn’t go through any towns or gas stations. I’ve done well over 90 miles in a day but it’s going to be tough doing it without refilling water, or taking a break from the Sun.
When I left, years ago, I didn’t tell a single soul. I left everything behind, hoping I could outrun the person I was becoming. Too many times, I’d look in the mirror, thinking about the decisions I’d made, the people I’d hurt, and I’d see my father staring back at me.

Regardless of my thoughts on J. J. Abram’s 2009 Star Trek reboot (the topic of another, angrier post), I’m cautiously optimistic about its sequel, due out in May of next year. But as TrekMovie.com noted in a post last night, “it is still the case that no plot or character information for the Star Trek sequel has been officially confirmed by Paramount or anyone associated with the movie.”
Lieutenant Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the sole survivor of the alien attack on the mining ship Nostromo, is awakened by a salvage ship after drifting through space in cryo-sleep for fifty-seven years in her escape pod. After her rescue, officials at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation (regularly referred to as “The Company”) give her a cold reception by revoking her flight license. Much to her horror, they reveal that planet LV-426, where her crew discovered the alien, has since been colonized without incident. However, when communication with the colony is lost, Ripley initially refuses to help, but her recurring nightmares and coxing by a representative of the Company, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), convince her to accompany a group of Colonial Marines to investigate the situation. What awaits them all is a swarm of Xenomorphs that have infested the colony, the likes of which these marines are not prepared for, but Ripley will ultimately not be deterred from confronting and destroying the horror that haunts her.
The evening will start at 6.30pm with a drinks reception, followed by a three course dinner – and then the quiz!

Looking at it logically, it seems quite likely. I know many English pitching yeasts contained brettanomyces. In running beers, they wouldn't have been apparent as the beer would have been consumed long before they could have made their presence felt. But Pale Ales were Stock Ales, matured, as we've learned for up to 12 months in the barrel.Plenty of time to affect the beers flavour.
In other boat news, the yard where the boat is stored has been sold and we've been given 30-day notice to vacate. This morning, we talked to Vanessa, our broker, and she said the local gossip runs toward the new owners being developers who are trying to circumvent the state moratorium on converting boatyards into condos. Regardless, it seems like we have to find a new home for the ZP. Vanessa has a guy who is interested, so keep your fingers crossed that finding her new home will be somebody else's problem!
In response, several white men got up and declared the purpose of the movement was to be recorded and that having folks on video couldn't possibly have the ramifications that we had explained such as immigration sweeps or people losing employment or housing. Listening to these responses I was frustrated by concrete concerns being seemingly disregarded, but even more so at how privilege operates to convince individuals that their experiences within society are universal -- how security for some makes the lack of safety for others invisible.
The small but tenacious team responsible for protecting cultural heritage in Cienfuegos got their first taste of victory in 1995, when the city’s historic centre was declared a national monument. “We kept going in the conviction that our contemporary heritage had value, and we persuaded the authorities to appreciate that,” he said.
Its Spring in my little corner of the Universe. The sun is shining the flowers are blooming and we are preparing for battle. The sparrows have taken over the dryer vent and the bees are congregating in the air conditioner. Every year they insist on making my home their home, and every year we send out eviction notices. It’s not like they don’t have anywhere else to go mind you. There is literally a ring of foliage surrounding my house. Any number of them suitable nesting grounds for the little beast.

After getting a room and leading the girls to the room the guys weren’t shy about their intentions. Kissing and on the way to getting naked, all four of them were in this hotel room making out. This is when Isabel woke up from her vodka induced coma. She decided that she was in the wrong place at the wrong time. “This isn’t right, I want to go home!” she said as she grabbed her jacket and stormed out the door. After a couple of minutes, she stuck her head back in the door and demanded “Let’s go Marianna. I’m not doing this.” “Isabel, get your ass back in here. We’re just having a little fun”, Marianna responded. “Why don’t you be more like your friend?” Roger said to Isabel. This upset Isabel more than she could express. “If you don’t come out of there, Marianna, I’m walking home.” Isabel said as she slammed the hotel door.

Our “occupy” movement would last for the better part of a year, even after I received a stay. Day rooms would be “occupied,” Hallways. Medical. Disciplinary hearings. The food slots and showers. Non-violently, changes would occur. For the better part of a year, other inmates would be inspired to protest their execution dates, like Tommy Hughes, Marion Dudley and Lamont Reese, whose actions would make the CNBC news. We declared our lives–all lives–have value. Our lives–all lives–have worth! We stated that. We meant that.

However that word “normally” suggests that there may be extreme examples of zoning laws which remove rights of user so completely as to amount to an acquisition (or at least an extinguishment) of property. In the Tasmanian Dams Case (1983) 158 CLR 1, Mason J (as he then was) cited with approval US authority as to when regulatory action might amount to a “taking” or extinquishment of property (albeit noting that Australia’s Constitution required not just “taking” but also “acquisition” of property before the “just terms” guarantee would be engaged):

On the other hand, supermarkets stock a reasonable amount of cereals, though less than in England. I am relying on general impressions, rather than targeted research: I keep forgetting to check when I do the shopping. I did notice, however, that even Biedronka has cornflakes and one other standard cereal. One of their adverts also shows a child eating cereal with milk - part of shop rather than product advertising, however. The volume of milk available in shops brings my direct experience into even stronger doubt, as there are usually large stocks held there.
The relaxed attitude of the client and the large site (10 000m²) provided the architects with a golden opportunity to explore the home three-dimensionally with advanced 3D computer software, and fuse the programmatic requirements into the 3D model.

It’s time to get serious:
I’m not laughing at the Romney/Republican’s because, frankly, I already knew how they felt about gay rights and gay marriage. If anything, this kind of insincerity is expected during the election and it wouldn’t surprise me to see more. The only thing that’s funny is the proud gay man who, for all his intelligence, allowed himself to be a pawn just to be removed by his own team! Okay so the man had issues with President Obama’s foreign policy and representation in the global community. I’m not up to speed on the current foreign policy so for all I know, Grenell may have some valid points. My question is why did he decide to work for the Romney campaign? Let’s say that I hypothetically give Romney the benefit of the doubt and imagine that Romney himself and his team had no issues with the LGBT. Romney still represents/advocates the interests of a group that does NOT support gay rights, gay marriage etc. Why would Grenell use his energy and intelligence to further the interests of a group that ARE in favor of subverting his own?

The recipe below asks for mixed spice, you buy a proprietary blend of course or make your own. I decided to make my own – simply because I didn’t have any. The good thing about making your own is that you can remove spices you don’t like, and enhance the ones you do. Typical spices are the warm ones: cinnamon, mace, allspice (pimento), nutmeg, cloves and ginger. I also think a little black pepper would be good, but I have never tried it.

The two matches couldn’t have been more different, but they both worked, and rocked.

I’m beginning to think that the writers realized they were closing in on the season finale and needed to kick things up into high gear, whether it made sense for the characters or not. Alas, the show still has much to learn. For example, hire better child actors (*cough* Baelfire *cough*), write better dialogue (come on, surprise me), give us some steamy hook-ups. The plot evolution of the show is pretty good so far (I love learning more about all the different fairy tale characters). It’s everything else that needs a little work. One thing they definitely improved on is how they distribute time between characters in an episode. ‘The Return’ featured many favorites (see: Mr. Gold’s amazing therapy session with Archie Hopper/’Jiminy Cricket’), and gave them appropriate screen time without taking away from the central conflict of the episode between Rumpelstiltskin and his son. This balance is great for the character of Henry, who started out as tolerable–too much exposition–but, turns out, is fantastic in moderation (and, let’s face it, he’s a cute little kid to have around).

When it come to showing the world what you’re good at, it is best to show everyone in a slightly different way to how everyone else is doing it. We decided not to go for white backdrop but an expensive rich looking “dark Cordovan”….ok ok its brown but brown doesn’t sound as classy
I'm fully aware that some people may have had their own water issues to deal with lately, such as having no water at all like my mom (thanks to a busted water main) or Botswana (thanks to its unfortunate location in the Kalahari Desert). However, while I feel for these people, I would contend that my situation was just a teeny bit worse because they didn't have children that suddenly seemed filthy and needed now-impossible baths, nor did they need to call a plumber.
~ Witchcraft in the European context
My Baba Yaga does have a different backstory than yours (that'll be me, Sarwat, unless you, dear reader, are writing Baba Yaga to, which would be insanely cool, don't you think?), but I don’t want to give all that away quite yet. Let’s just say that it’s in keeping with the romance aspect of my fantasy. But like the Baba Yaga in Dark Goddess, my witch is unpredictable, upset at some of the things that have happened to her and around her, and has some secret plans…
We still had some time on our hands before the first official game, so we set up a final playtest of our Rough Wooing scenario for the convention. Norman posted a report as part of his convention coverage. As the French commander I found that the weight of the cavalry force on my right flank was enough to flatten the English, and my left flank distracted their center forces enough that my center was able to move forward and seize the gun. I had the opportunity to take the French side again during the third running on Saturday and found that it was not so easy to do again...
Today was an absolutely glorious day! So to take advantage of the 70 degree weather we decided to go to the zoo after church and after the girls' nap. I have been planning on going to the zoo with the girls for a VERY long time, let's just say that the girls had their "zoo" outfits before they were ever born! What can I say? Anyways, I'm pretty sure everyone else in San Antonio had the same idea because it was CrAzY busy at the zoo. We got really lucky with a parking spot almost immediately and didn't have to stand in line for very long. They girls did great! They only cried out a few times, but I think they were either eager to get out and walk or they wanted a snack. Well enough of me talking, here are the pictures! :)

Click here for David Carroll’s commentary following the 2009 Murray County town meeting:
22:00 GMT: All quiet, no shots audible for some hours now. It seems the junta troops have reestablished control. I’d heard that soldiers had taken over the city’s two principal bridges over the Niger, but a friend who crossed the Pont Fahd four hours ago told me he saw no soldiers on or near it.

It's what I've been chasing all day, I think: silence. The lack of being needed or called or required. I've tried to create it with coordinated rest times and strategically placed videos, but it's been elusive. Busyness crashed around my edges willfully. Defiantly.
Comparing everyone’s home life, Wally definitely has the most normal of the group and as such is one of the most relatable of the cast. Add monologues to the mix and you essentially have the DC equivalent of a Spider-Man episode… which isn’t a bad thing.
Copyright and fair use are often presented as impossibly complicated concepts that the ordinary person could never hope to understand without the help of a lawyer. In fact, most people are so unsure of when fair use applies and when it doesn't, that they don't do plenty of things that they could do because they are worried about misinterpreting the rules and getting sued. Aufderheide and Jaszi make the argument that fair use is a powerful right, and that if we don't start using it, it will slowly be legislated away from us by influential copyright-owning corporations.

Expect it to take around 2 weeks to arrive on their standard shipping offering. Shipping isn't cheap, but as I said, that's lasted me 2 years and I still have quite a bit in the bottle. Also, expect your post people to be grumpy about receiving it unless they've updated their MSDS labeling in their shipping documentation. It is worth the wait and the displeased post carrier. There's no chemical smell, only a faint orange scent and it is the very best thing I've used to blend out my pencils.
As it turned out, I need not have worried. I discovered that codpieces, which were at their height (no pun intended) during of Henry VIII's reign, rapidly declined in the reign of Elizabeth who tended to keep a tight control on what people wore. As Road to London is set in Elizabeth’s reign, I felt that, in order to be historically accurate, my boy would wear the nice baggy Venetian hose. Thank goodness. Now I wouldn’t have to make that padded thing tied onto the front.
I pray today, that You would breathe on me God. That I would be awakened to You, and feel Your presence in my life. Father, I just can't stand to be away from You. "My slump" is from my own choice of distance---and I choose now God to come as near to You as I possibly can.

The legislation adopted since 1994, has the effect that the civil service, openly and as stated policy, discriminates against whites, that numerous, almost about all, whites lost their positions in the public services on account of their race, that on account of race managerial positions in white owned companies must be granted to blacks, that a certain number of shares in white owned companies must be transferred to blacks, that white owned farms must be expropriated on behalf of individual blacks and not for public purposes as is internationally required and that the study places for whites at universities, especially for the professions, are limited.
Kansas was admitted to the union under a clause in which the residents were to elect whether they were going to allow slavery or not. It was assumed that Kansas would become a slave state, but an enormous amount of violence erupted as a result. (This became known in the popular parlance as "Bleeding Kansas.") It seems that many Kansans - who will forever hold the moral high ground, and I'll swear to that - were pro-Union abolitionists ("Jayhawkers," in the common parlance,) particularly over in Lawrence, the neighboring village to Kansas. Fiery old John Brown was a Kansan, and the gun he was raising over his head in most of his iconography was mostly aimed towards the immediate east.

There is a famous steakhouse here in Calgary that will refuse to cook certain cuts of meat more than ‘Medium’ because the chef has designed the recipes and cuts of meat to be their most flavorful at temperature of ‘rare’ to ‘medium’. In this case… the rule has meaning. The rule is upheld and has become a defining aspect of the culture of the steakhouse. Cool.

The latest post from Suleika Jaouad, and some good reflections on the awkwardness it brings to relationships.

Everything was going along just fine. That is until I ran out of my levothyroxine. Had my uterus and all its paraphernalia yanked along with it back in October. Since then not a hotflash to be had or a bitchy word to expel unto any victim. Then I had to go and run out of those eensy-weensy little pills. Ever hear "nurses make the worst patients"? I do nothing to dispel that theory.

In 1994, the universal health care plan proposed by President Clinton included a mandate requiring all individuals to purchase health insurance. The Congressional Budget Office studied the issue and concluded that the United States had never in all its history mandated that individuals purchase any good or service. The CBO stated:
Third, and most importantly, it’s in our control to create a good environment for luck. Not totally control it, but draw it to us by our actions.

A reasonable starting point for that discussion is the Gallipoli campaign itself, one of the greatest political and military blunders of the twentieth century. As American historian David Fromkin wrote in 1989:

In terms of characters, I love Serenity. While I was reading Build A Man I was constantly wishing Serenity was a real person so that I could become friends with her. She was so fun, with so much life and energy, even when she was in a bad situation she still managed to pull herself out. I found her such a unique, interesting character. Even though she may have made some bad and morally wrong decisions, she still has a conscience and never set out to intentionally hurt anyone. I also liked the character of Jeremey too, enjoying the way in which his character gave a glimpse into male insecurities, which is not often present in chick lit. The way in which he has also been hurt in past relationships, made him seem genuine, if a little guarded.
What strikes me as most magical about white currants is the natural dye in the red seeds which tints the jam to a soft, fleshy pink. As an added enticement, currants have a naturally high pectin content which sets virtually immediately. It is the perfect complement to fill a simple Victorian sponge; spread lightly on a delicate ladyfinger; drizzle on vanilla ice cream; twirl into some whipped cream for a fool; or just zip a knife's edge of it over your morning toast.

I guess that working extra for no pay all these years has made me tend toward martyrdom (and a “glass half empty” perspective.) I know I don’t get paid what I’m worth and that I am waaaaaaaay over-qualified for what I do. I also know I am lucky to work where I do. It’s just that I finally jumped on the “work smarter, not harder” bandwagon, and I don’t want to get off yet!!!

That I would, to borrow an overused phrase, just do it.

Judyann McNamara, a Canadian homeopath, director of the Montreal College of Classical Homeopathy, and former physicist has said this of the report: “Circumstances have never been as opportune as now, in the quantum era for homeopathy to come to full acceptance by western medicine. The burgeoning new field of scientific research emerging from the convergence of nanoscience, biotechnology and quantum physics is paving the way for biologists to be able to understand the level at which homeopathy induces healing responses.”

The solution as proposed by the European Commission, to have either the data subject or the DPA to bring action against the other DPA on the territory of this DPA is far from satisfactory.

Just as America looks at its recent history in terms of before and after 9-11, the families and loved ones of servicemen and women killed during this conflict divide their lives into a different ‘before and after’ – before the death of their loved one, and after. And those many who are seriously wounded have their own ‘before and after.’ In June 2005, we could barely imagine the tragedy of losing 11 of our brothers during Operation Redwing. Now six years later, we have lost double that number in a single incident. And so once again, the horror and tragedy of war becomes all too real to us. “Eleven,” or “twenty-two” or “sixty-nine” – those are big numbers to our small community, but each one of those killed was an individual, a human being, a member of the Naval Special Warfare family, with his own life, dreams, family, hopes and aspirations. A Naval Special Warfare wife who knew some of those killed in the recent tragedy in August, and who knows many of their families well, recently wrote in a public forum,

I don't entirely agree with you when you say that 'standard' publishers are not really for 'new, older' authors who submit manuscripts. A writer can start writing, and writing well at any age, young or old. J K Rowling is a case in point. And remember, every commercially published author was once a 'new' author.
So he says if you’re really serious about studying that kind of culture, you’ve got to be willing to take that chance. If you can stand up to this false attack, then they’ll be curious about you and wanna know about you, because they’ll be wondering about what reality you’re coming from.

Never mind that the piece was a gift for yet another friend making an eagerly awaited march up the aisle, or that the ceremony was days away. Mary-Emma had had enough. Though only eighteen, she had seen too many friends and relations enter into unions that began with joy and a sense of achieving the ultimate purpose in life, but that now were enjoyed the way a casual traveler comes upon the ruins of a castle in a forest — admired for the magnificence they once proclaimed and endured with silent grief over what they had become.

I saw her back turned away from me as she opened her driver’s door in her car. And I thought to myself, I was looking at one of the greatest persons here on earth who knew how to persevere as she cared for her family and not even think about her own needs. She used to thank me for a cup of coffee I insisted on buying for her and that how much I encouraged her to be strong. Little did she know, she was the one who also inspired me as I looked at the accomplishments she was achieving, one by one, despite what was going on in her life.

It was cold. Really cold. In fact after about 15 minutes I was ready to call on the radio and see if anyone wanted to go land and get some hot chocolate. But no one else seemed to mind their frozen fingertips, so I gave myself the challenge of trying to stay airborne while flying around closer to the ground where the couple degrees of temperature increase would make all the difference. And then the magic happened.

Eventually, I shared my secret with a pastor’s wife, who I still adore and deeply respect, who pushed me to seek professional help. Through that long, arduous process, I stopped asking why. I became a child trying to learn how to tie my shoe. I began to ask God how my broken shards could be of worth to the people around me and to the kingdom of God. My prayers, while no less agonizing and painful, were now pleas to Christ for wisdom on how to navigate my suffering. I affirmed that God’s ways were higher than my ways and I trusted that he would honor my struggle with what little I had.

Now for the next anime update. This one concerns a recently airing anime called “Hyouka”. I am still pretty unsure about this anime, but the first 2 episodes already give a hint of what it’s going to be. Since both Episodes 1 and 2 has mystery solving in it, and the synopsis from MyAnimeList seems to give away the actualy spoiler that is supposed to be revealed in episode 3, I find it quite interesting already. Though, I am still unsure whether to download it or not, I still can’t find that “Download Quality” in it. Anyway, it is pretty interesting so you can go check it out if you want.

Of course. Walk. Of COURSE.

Interestingly, this face-saving explanation of racial asymmetry, which I will call the “Face-Saving Racial Myth,” has now become the dominant racial narrative across the entire mainsteam media and most of the political spectrum, not because it is true. Indeed, everybody secretly knows it is untrue in the same way that everybody secretly gives their kids exactly the same kind of advice that John Derbyshire said he gave his. No, this Fairy Godmother explanation of racial asymmetry is favoured simply for reasons of short-term political and economic expediency because America is a political entity and collection of economic entities that all run on short-term political and economic expediency.

As we were waiting to be seated, he leaned back and checked out my ass. Most guys would just do that as we were walking to the table rather than being so blatantly obvious. I rolled my eyes and shot him a bit of an annoyed glare. He smiled, winked at me… and then reached over and patted. my. ass. And I don’t mean like the kind of grab that a handsy guy in a bar gives. I’m talking a loving pat on the bottom that you give a small child. Like it was something that was already his.

After my last long-run two weeks ago, I decided to take it easy. I walk nightly and I foam roll. I stretch lightly after my walks. I’ve been doing this for nearly two weeks and it drives me crazy. The lack of exercise has really affected my moods and my will to live (OK, maybe that was a bit mellow-dramatic). Last night I ran for the first time, just under three miles. At first it felt amazing and I took an easy route as I needed a confidence boost as well as a route that wouldn’t leave me sore the next day. But, one-and-a-half miles in, my right calf and hip flexor flared up. I was bummed, big-time.
Whatever your motivation for your encounter with God, be it fear, financial stresses, changes, cancer, divorce, or other problems or issues, whatever motivates you to seek God, hang on to Him and do not let go. When you get close enough to grab a hold of God, hang onto Him. Hold on to Him and get into the presence of God and intimate with Him, it will change your life. Hold on to God. Do not give up or in but hold tight!
When you value what you do, others will too.

Even though I'd read the directions and thought I understood the process of painting my cupcakes, I realized that here was yet another reason I was a photographer and not a painter.

Expectations are a good way to set yourself up for disappointment. We have hopes and dreams and goals for our lives. But, the outcome (where we eventually end up) is not totally in your hands. Your life is affected by many variables that are totally out of your control. These variables directly influence whether we attain our goals or not.
Alright folks ... we had a great turnout in October and we are only looking for you lazy bums to haul your butts out to skate about once every four to six weeks so no excuses. And to those of you who missed the skate last time, you missed a lot of fun - the weather was crisp and the companionship was great. Kevin Ryan (ex-FDNY) and Ronnie Lopez (ex-Sawchuk winner) in goal - how could we go wrong? Lopez even pulled out one of his patented laying-on-his-back-and-leg-in-the-air saves. Ho cool is that?

Anyway – we certainly had a lot of information to take in and I still had a dozen questions at the end of the whole process!! But at the end of the day I came away feeling that I definitely, positively, absolutely would like to have a Hearing Dog.
We can already see that the serious cleanup objectively called for would require an international emergency effort on the scale of that undertaken during the World Wars. We demand that as part of an environmental public works program, millions of the able-bodied unemployed be hired at union wages and benefits, trained, housed, fed, and equipped with proper protective equipment, and deployed to scour the waters, the wetlands, the islands, and the beaches; to clean and rehabilitate injured wildlife; and to dispose of the waste in an environmentally sensitive manner.
Our orangutans...they always seem so sad. I would be sad too if I had to live in this place. I have always hoped our zoo would improve their living conditions. This is a part of zoos that kind of makes my heart unhappy for them...so we said hi today to him.
Most surprising of all, though, “Chico & Rita,” has been nominated for an Academy Award as best animated feature – usually the sole province of family oriented fare. In a film year generally acknowledged as one of the most lackluster, it will be interesting to see if “The Artist” and “Chico and Rita” show that breaking out of the box sometimes gets you to the Oscar stage.
In my new quest to achieve blooming flowers all summer long, I have become a big fan of The Farm in Orleans. My sister and my mom have been big fans about this "farm" for a long time. They never would invite me to go with them because they knew the thought of planting something made me break out in hives. My sister asked my mom to go there on my mom's birthday a few weeks ago and I asked if I could tag along. After they got up off the floor, they agreed.

After much negotiation I finally persuaded her that large unidentified fungi are probably more comfortable living in woods than in a back garden where a not-very-bright King Charles Spaniel will first pee on them and then eat them. And I definitely put my foot down when it came to taking the Fly Agaric home. Anything that looks like something a gnome would sit on it has got to be a BAD thing.

Joseph did not want Mary to face harsh lawful penalties which accompany the charge of adultery, nor did he want her to face public ridicule. He also realized marriage and fatherly support for this child might bring lifelong ridicule upon himself. Regardless, Joseph chose to obey Gods command, becoming a husband and an adoptive father to Christ. No matter how much Joseph may have questioned and sought understanding on his own, he eventually chose to stick with a principle to trust God’s plan. As Isaiah prophesied in Old Testament writings, the New Testament text from Matthew gives an account of Joseph’s commitment for years to come.

Even when I walked to the nearest petrol station, which happened to be two miles away, in my 4-inch high heels of bouncy-castle-puncturing fame; my feet, a bloodied, blistered mess. I proceeded to fill a jerrycan which I had found at the entrance of the station as I was in too much agony to go into the shop to buy one. And no sooner had the fuel hit the bottom of the can than I heard a loud whoosh and felt my eyebrows and nostril singe from the heat of the flames.
Nevertheless, I felt no discomfort when reading Julian of Norwich’s Showings. Perhaps that is because it was not my first reading of her revelations using such prevalent maternal language and imagery when referring to God and especially to Jesus. Or perhaps I was not uncomfortable because she is not agenda-driven in her writing. Though Julian often refers to Jesus as our Mother, she continues to refer to him as “he” and just as often pairs the parental reference as God our Father and God our Mother.

At first it's just little things, like the way the salamander on the door knocker of The Society of Philosophical Chemistry seems to turn its head to look at Maya. Then she learns that she and James are somehow related to both old Henri-Pierre and the man with the purple eyes, who apparently arranged to bring them to France. But why? Maya also learns about a group of children who have gone missing over the years and tries to find out what has become of them.
Dry hopping with Nugget? We admired the pluck, but were a bit concerned. Although it’s not uncommon to dry hop with super alphas that also have high essential oil (e.g., Columbus, Magnum, Summit, Simoce), most of said oil consists of myrcene and we were worried about off flavors (cat piss, grassy or machine –yuck!). How would all those essential oils, mainly myrcene in the Centennials and Nuggets, react with the alcohol, Co2, yeast, sugars, and oxygen?

For if you “control” ones self there is of NO NEED for another to try to preceive control of another is needed. You simply do not end up crossing paths with those whom you see in these fashions.

Over at CRAFT this week, we are sponsored by Floppy Latte, Stamping Boutique and Hope Jacare Doodles. Our theme is animals, and I have used an image by Stamping Boutique. I just love this cheeky monkey. The papers are freebies from magazines again and I decided to add some corrugated card for texture. Have a great day.

The back story of occult characters and families retreating to the haunted moors of Elizabethan England provides a fiction to populate the depths of Harrow Home with ghoul cults and witch's covens, servants of the mummy, soul-jumping body thieves, devil worshipers, degenerate serpent people left over from Pictish times, and perhaps even the odd vampire from the Old Country or a mad scientist bent on re-animating the dead. What's not to love about it?

I just couldn't resist sharing this fun gift we got from our wonderful friends Phillip and Amy. They just came back from a trip down Route 66! We were blown away when they brought these back for us. A 6 pack for each of us. Lee's favorite is cream soda so they got him 6 different kinds.
I would give anything to have my friend back again. I miss her so much.

Kelly retained her title with her X-Factor and won. Eve accompanied her to the ring to second her and made sure that Nikki Bella did not interfere.
But my main point is that even if there wasn’t a woman left in the world who believed in chastity, courting, marriage and family, that would still not be a justification for a Christian man to give up on his ideal of chastity.
Sorry the video embed doesn’t appear here. I spent an hour trying to embed this – and Lockerz, the glitzy kiddie-show site which WordPress wants us to use, is Simply Worthless in addition to being the most visually offensive place I have seen this year. And that’s being nice. It seems that Lockerz has also elminated the letter “s” and replaced it with “z” as well. You can get yourself some Decalz at Lockers, yessir. And although their video to WordPress system blows goats, I did get some Pointz for trying.

The goal was to start off with 10:30s and pull back to 10:10-10:15 after I warmed up. Derek had offered to pace me and my friend, Shanda, was going to run with us as well. Both are significantly faster than me... but I had to depend solely on them for pacing because my Garmin 405 does not like moisture and newsflash - we were wet, wet, wet.

My eyesight is really getting bad in the past few years. I about went cross eyed trying to thread the needle with the one strand floss and two strands Glisson Gloss. This is pretty hard for young eyes as it is. So, I pulled out my bi-focals that I got before I left Rochester. However, the dr. (who could hardly speak English) I think gave me the wrong prescription, which is why I hardly wear them. I looked through the bi-focal part and saw double. Somehow, I successfully threaded the needle.

In any event, it's a very simple recipe and I was kinda excited to be able to say, "I made my own homemade cheese". So how did I do? Well, for such an easy recipe, I managed to mess it up. A couple of suggestions, so you can learn from my mistakes:
Amateur porn hour goes badly to say the least, again, I’m sadly not a producer of porn, but if I was I’m fairly certain I’d have utilised my given space and time in a better manner than a bit of girl on girl writhing, I’d have also probably suggested that, given her semi-conscious state, Daisy probably isn’t best placed for anything requiring coordination like climbing atop a ghost town bar, or walking and I definitely wouldn’t have allowed the arse with the badly constructed beard to join in the action. Fortunately for everyone this erotic interlude is short lived as poor scrawny, semi-conscious Daisy comes over all queasy and makes a run for freedom. To her credit she manages to run a fair old way before she finally succumbs to some violent vomiting, less to her credit she then proceeds to stumble about bare foot in some wasteland littered with broken glass, but ultimately this is really the least of her worries as, before she has time to worry about tetanus, El Mascarado proves himself less of an urban legend and more of a crazy man in tights and swiftly puts her out of her misery, and rips off her face.
And, as we all know when we stop to think about it for a moment, if you make enough scattershot claims, over a long enough time, one of them is almost bound to come true - or kind of, anyway.

The thing is that, I felt so so so so so bad that my best friend wasn't talking to me. I mean, after exams, no school, why the hell you didn't talk to me? I didn't do anything wrong, did I? But yesterday I found out. I didn't do anything on purpose, and if I hurt your feeling, i'm sorry, that would be the last thing I wanted to do. Now that I told you what have been happening you understand... right? I just hope we can talk again, because seriously, I was about to cry because I didn't know what to do because we weren't talking.

Though it's a frozen meal, everything had a fresh taste. I really appreciated the texture of everything as well.

But in the meantime she has her husband and I have a high powered libido that needs to be satisfied. So her suggestion of giving Jen and Luke a call seems like a good idea since I'm all alone in this town for the next two days. I return to my hotel room and wait until about 11:00 am, which I deemed a reasonable hour to call the number Jen and Luke had given me the other night. I pick up the phone and dial the number. Jen answers.
It has reached the point that I deliberately shove him off the table during lunch, attack him aggressively during arguments (with which, I just have to say, I’m ALWAYS right–without fail), and just refuse to send him a message when his boss is already going crazy looking for him (because I know he’s just with his bitch and it wouldn’t hurt when he hears his name over the PA system–or better yet, when he gets reprimanded by his boss).

Working on my book I've come across two wild foods which I have never actually collected and I'm therefore unsure of how to identify them: alexanders (smyrnium olustratum) and the Ground Elder (aegopodium podagraria) On pictures of reference books they look very similar. On passing in the car on a wee country lane nearby I thought I had spotted one or the other the other day, so I decided to go on an expedition to find said greens. This is what it looked like:

We hunt hold up men around the clock once they are identified. We send teams of fire breathing fence jumper/door kickers to find them. We will bring their mother to the office and convince her she is going to jail if we don't have Junior in our office in an hour.

Most of the time they won't. Fuck their own momma.

"Narcopolis" spans approximately 30 years in the life of a city (Bombay), intricately weaving together the lives of its colorful inhabitants to offer us (reader, outsider) a lens through which to attempt comprehension. Vacillating between the defined perimeters of opium den, harem, and hovel; between tragedies of the personal, cultural, and environmental; between the lives of scholars, criminals, and children, "Narcopolis" attempts cultural encapsulation through constant flux and a flood of poetic revelations.

So I just want to explain something I think a lot of people don't understand when people are depressed or struggling. If you tell me it could always be worse, it really doesn't help much. I KNOW they could be worse. I am not an idiot. It's just that when you are going through something that stresses you for a long time. Something that seems relentless and unceasing. It doesn't matter whether or not things could be worse. It becomes irrelevant because your mind is so clouded, and you are so physically exhausted from it all you don't care. You just want something to break through. Something to shine some light on it all. It doesn't have to be the cure to all your problems. It doesn't even have to be something you cling to like the last life raft off the Titanic. No that thing that breaks through and changes everything. Whatever it is it needs to be …I dunno …significant in some way. A positive life changing thing. Something that doesn't give you false hope, but lifts you up just enough so that you can see over the walls you have built around you, and know there is a lot more living left to do. I don't know if any of this makes sense. Maybe I am just rambling, but rambling is the way I work through these things and try to make sense of it all….

But the inspectors led by the experienced Hans Blix couldn’t find anything. Saddam, growing more frightened, steadily gave way to Blix’s demands. U.N. inspectors could travel anywhere they liked without giving advance notice, and they could do it in helicopters so there could be no phony traffic jams to impede them.

According to librarian Trevor Calvert, “I wanted to represent both collections of poetry as well as books on writing. When I was younger, I would read these great poems, and think, ‘Oh I wish I could do that’ without realizing that I needed no permission. So the books on writing act as a sort of permission to people that yes, they can write poetry, and also affirm that poetry is not an arcane set of symbols and allegory that must be deciphered if you are going to ‘get’ a poem.
Buying books is – without a doubt – my favourite Saturday morning pastime. It seems, however, that I have come to acquire more of the aforementioned than common sense as I am rapidly running out of space to accommodate them. Still, as someone who is short on sense I fear that this particular predicament will neither deter nor curtail my avarice. Trawling through the numerous shelves in a great little Oxfam in Notting Hill, my eye snagged on a book called Guilty by Georges Bataille. I have had a soft-spot for Bataille ever since I first discovered Story of the Eye at the tender age of 13. I read a few of his works thereafter including, The Solar Anus, L’Abbe C, On Nietzsche and Blue of Noon and found myself unanimously confounded, challenged and inspired by each and every one. I learned a lot about Bataille entirely through his work and came to realise that there are (in a very general sense) two kinds of writers: those who one admires, and those with whom one feels an affinity. Bataille, for me, has always been of the later variety through a mutual appreciation of writers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Franz Kafka and a desire to “respond to impulses of freedom and whims” or else “destroy myself” only to “discover myself, drowning in a glass of water”. In my case, however, it would more likely be a glass of second-rate gin but that is by and by.
Here you get a glimpse of the books on the wall in the restroom. It also shows some of the equipment on the tables down the middle of the MIDDLE section of the studio: Zyron, copy machine, coil binding machine, hot press, sewing machine. And you can glimpse Iris carts under the copy machine table... there are three which have collections of dice, dominoes, compasses, small boxes, encaustic supplies, and other supplies. On the wall outside the restroom is a bookcase for my graphic art book collection and clip art books.

Well the School Holidays is drawing to an end here in Queensland and I must say its been a jam packed two weeks here at home. Lots of things we have completed and a whole heap of RNR been accomplished ahhhhh... Totally relaxed and the kids have had a ball.
