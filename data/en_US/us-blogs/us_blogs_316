I found the answer I was looking for in the comments of another blog, in a post about giving your characters motivation. Someone mentioned a character from a book I've never heard of as an example of a character with no motivation, and the blog author pointed out that that character's motivation was to find his purpose. And boy, did that hit me like a ton of bricks!

I remembered these moments in my life, trials and tribulations, as this beautiful celebration was displayed on stage with such important lessons that I use to teach over two dozen times in a speech that I seem to forget although to this day I have a Lion King plaque on my desk at work that says “Remember who you are.” Maybe it is time to start giving this talk again… To become worthy of the speech.
Shook down on me
Are you sick of the mundane? Want a better life – free of debt, stress and nagging? Wanted: Man 45 – 60 with desire for betterment of self and all things. A chance to make a real difference. A heavenly opportunity. Minimal hours. Desirable package and terms. No chancers. Mid-life crisis a definite advantage.The interview too had made promises of great things – so far none of them had come to pass.
What a promise this is! Food, raiment, home, and so forth, God undertakes to add to you while you seek Him. You mind His business, and He will mind yours. If you want paper and string, you get them given in when you buy more important goods; and just so all that we need of earthly things we shall have thrown in with the kingdom. He who is an heir of salvation shall not die of starvation; and he who clothes his soul with the righteousness of God cannot be left of the Lord with a naked body. Away with carking care. Set all your mind upon seeking the Lord. Covetousness is poverty, and anxiety is misery: trust in God is an estate, and likeness of God is a heavenly inheritance. Lord, I seek Thee; be found of me.

I bought this Magenta stamp at the weekend and couldn't wait to use her as I needed to do something petty after my 'Vintage Males' She was coloured with watercolours and I spritzed some bronze perfect pearls onto my crafts sheet to paint over the flowers on her hat. I stamped an 'extra' bird as I wanted it to look as if it was flying down.
I can keep going, but I’m starting to get a bit depressed.
In this article, I'm not also talking to those who wear masculine versions of lolita such as kodona or dandy simply because I haven't exposed myself to their side of our world enough to have the knowledge to comment on them- this goes for broli's as well. I don't want to label the men in our community as catty if they aren't, or hold them up as an example of sweetness if they don't suit that term either. I don't like to talk about things I don't know well, because that's always a recipe for disaster, especially when you're commenting on the thoughts and actions of an entire group you don't know well. I stayed away from discussing it, but if there are any male followers of our fashion who would like to add their two cents, please do so - I'd love to get a better understanding!
Enter the blog world. I have been so inspired by all these amazingly talented, thrifty, diy'ers. I decided, "you know what, I can do that." I consider myself to be a somewhat stylish chic. I know what I like when I see it and my head is swirling with ideas. I figured if I am going to stay in this house another 5 + years, I better make this house a home. After lots of convincing, I think I have the Hubs on board. Of course, he thinks the house looks great and I do too, it just needs some tweaking and a little extra love.

I'm pulling back from the Internet too. I'm so easily sucked into it, reading blogs, news stories, some total time-wasting junk. Then I ask myself where the day has gone. Hah! I'm going to try hard to post what's needed, and then turn off my browser. I get so much more writing done with the Internet turned off, and housework too!
Beer and food matching is something I thoroughly enjoy deriding, but I’m going to lay off on this one. My observation from reading newspaper columns and watching TV shows is that wine experts often eulogise about fine wines that may indeed cost a few bob more than a regular 3 for £10 Jacobs Creek special offer that I might buy to go with whatever attempt at cookery I’m about to thrill my lovely lady squeeze with. This may be an attempt to encourage the reader or viewer to be a little more adventurous in their choices though I also observe most of the audience for such things are more interested in reading and watching than doing. The only recipe I have ever knocked up from a cookery show was courtesy of Delia Smith, though I would credit watching daytime telly favourite ready steady cook as a student as being full of informative tips on knocking out edible scran quickly. I’ve never bought a bottle of wine recommended to me by a wine ponce off the telly or in a newspaper lifestyle section. However my main observation is that whatever grog they are banging on about, it is never referenced from the perspective that the regular commonly enjoyed brands are in any way shite.

Mr. Hunch now makes his entrance. He needs to, because this is a very even matchup when all is read. But after all is said and done, the home field advantage is huge for San Francisco. The 49ers wouldn’t have stood much of a chance in my opinion if last week’s matchup had been held down in the Big Easy. And it’s back to The ‘Stick to decide who represents the NFC in Indianapolis, thanks in part to the Packers laying an egg last week. The weather won’t play a big factor (the heavy rains that pelted my house all of yesterday and last night have now passed on to leave only an occasional shower). But the fans, and the familiar comforts of home, coupled with the lack of a cross-country flight (that may aid the spread of the stomach flu throughout the Giants squad) will make the difference for San Francisco to make their sixth Super Bowl appearance.
The Last Drive were a Greek garage revival rock group which formed in 1983, broke up in 1995 and reformed in 2007. They started playing under the name "Last Drive" (adopted from a cocktail by that name) in late 1983. Having performed alongside many important bands they were rightly regarded as the most important Greek rock group of the 80's. A few to name were the Fuzztones, Dead Moon, the Wipers, the Gun Club, the Dream Syndicate, Jesus & Mary Chain.... and the list goes long. 'Heatwave' their second album, which was produced by Peter Zaremba of the Fleshtones, established their name in Europe, and re-released by Music Maniac Records, a label specializing in garage-rock releases.

Tonight, my captors came over to keep me company. Given that I am essentially an inanimate object, it's not like they need to worry about me running away.

In other words, the message to the Labour Party (and to a lesser extent the Lib Dems and Plaid Cymru) is, 'You screwed up big time with the first two rounds of funding, this is your last chance'. Which, in effect means, 'Dump the third sector; stop funding village halls and 'hobby' projects such as narrow gauge railways. Instead, focus on infrastructure, business and training.' Which is what I have argued for years.

Here’s the Cliff’s Notes summary of Twilight: It is the story of a teenage girl named Bella Swan. Bella meets a mysterious boy at school named Edward Cullen. Edward acts really weird around Bella — kind of like he can’t stand to be anywhere near her — which turns out to be because he is a vampire, she smells unspeakably delicious, and therefore he can’t stand to be anywhere near her.

Mr. Curry and I found an amazing therapist who would see us for $75 which is a very good deal, and we went to see him and Dakota stood tall and lanky and charmingly awkward with Ever in the waiting room and watched her so Mr. Curry and I could go into this man's office and tell him where we are broken, and could he help? And I think he could, only we just yesterday received notice that I have to pay childcare for Ever at my work which I had not been asked to pay before and now we are royally and truly fucked and the first thing I thought when I heard this news was Would it really be so bad to live in Kentucky? because I have this idea that if we lived somewhere that we could actually afford to live, we might not be miserably crawling out of each day wondering how we are going to feed and care for our children properly that day, and the next, and so forth. Mr. Curry is looking for a weekend job and I think I will have to drop Ever's insurance at my work because otherwise we cannot pay our bills and rent because we simply do not have enough money coming in to pay that and childcare.

It has been several months since we haven`t had to deal with a Monday morning melt-down. M seemed fine last night when he went to bed. Sometimes, inexplicably, we all wake up on the wrong side of the bed. This was certainly the case for M this am. Despite his rocky start, he had a relatively good day at both school and daycare. He was in a good mood tonight and didn`t kick up a fuss when his electronics time was over or when it was time for bed. Although M`s melt-downs are furious, they don`t to tend last very long and usually blow over relatively quickly. But like most storms, M leaves a trail of mayhem behind him. In this case, two bewildered and weary parents.

I just saw Despicable Me (the whole way through) for the first time, and may I just say, it was GREAT! I really enjoyed Julie Andrews as Mr. Gru's mother.... her fake accent was hilarious, as well as her cackle! That movie cracked me up, and it was just so adorable to see a despicable person like Gru softening up and warming to those three adorable little girls. I loved the part when the youngest girl, Agnes, won the unicorn from the carnival and she said "It's so fuzzy!" Priceless. And the little yelow minions were adorable! I was wondering though, were they speaking in Spanish? Sometimes it sounded like the minions were saying some Spanish words but other times I heard English words.
What of the schools? They are not in place to babysit, this is certain, but the curriculum, in many cases, focuses on separatism, and the object is to move students along, without disciplining in fear of lawsuits, or laws in place that bind the hands of the teachers as to the rights they may have even to protect themselves from a violent student.

In retrospect, I should have let the filled cookies firm up on a sheet pan in the fridge before packaging them, since the cream was kind of messy, but I had a dance party to get to! Note, however, that the cookies should be served at room temperature so the cookie and filling are soft.

Speaking of fall, it used to be my favorite season. Halloween. Leaves changing colors. Thanksgiving. Black Friday. What's not to love about it? That is until I grew up and learned how much I actually loathe winter. Then fall became nothing more than a warning sign of cold death to follow... kinda like when a seagull flies out to sea to die or when someone gets the whooping cough.. always ends poorly. Then it's month after month of bitter, bitter cold. Needless to say, Spring will forever dominate as season of the year in my book.

Aye Sally. I wrote ‘Joe’ at fourteen years of age. It was a very steamy novel, and was all of a school exercise book in length (small writing). Every single chapter ended with the eponymous hero having sex with someone. Yes. (Are you cringing yet? Yes, I can feel it from here.) Trouble was, I was such an innocent, I had absolutely no idea what actually did happen. Mechanics and things. The ins and outs. (Sorry). Thus, in my first novel, each
Having grown up in Massachusetts my whole life, I decided on something to commemorate my home state, and my love of the changing seasons/wacky weather we are graced with here. I told Alastair just that, and he did the research and came up with something more beautiful than I ever could have put together myself. The background incorporates traditional Japanese-style elements of water and air, while all the Massachusetts state symbols are represented; the right whale, ladybug, mayflower, chickadee, and elm tree. Fall leaves and snowflakes are interwoven into the sleeve as well, to tie it all together. It still requires a bit more touching up before it's completely done, but for all intents and purposes, it's finished, and I love it.

I took my paperwork to my doctor, Dr. Homeyer, and he told me that he had no idea what to put down as the kind of treatment that I need (this paperwork is to ensure that wherever we are sent, there is someone who can take care of the medical issues). After talking with him, he told me that he didn't want me to stop trying. Even if we did stop trying, that I needed to continue to medicate myself for the PCOS. He asked for one more try before I gave up. I went home that night, talked to Mat, and called my doctor the next day. We had decided to go ahead and try one more time.

In March 1911, an Italian film entitled L'inferno was released. Deemed the first full-length Italian motion picture, it is also noteworthy for being loosely based on Dante Alighieri epic poem "The Divine Comedy". In the poem, Dante travels through the three aspects of the Christian afterlife: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise, or Heaven). Many artists have used this poem as inspiration for their illustrations, perhaps most notable among them Gustave Doré, whose etchings graced the 1857 edition of the poem. It was this edition which inspired the film. (view the etchings here)

Saturday morning Kátia and Cássio were baptized....I played the organ, "As Famílias Poderão Ser Eternas" before the baptism and as I played I could see the whole family seated on the first row in front of the organ waiting for the meeting to start. What a wonderful and beautiful sight...Kátia and her 12 year old son Cássio smiling and dressed in white, waiting to be baptized and surrounded by the rest of their family. I felt so much love and gratitude for a Heavenly Father that loves us so much and wants us to be happy!! It was a very beautiful baptism...
Gable to me embodies masculinity in a timeless way.. not to mention he oozes charisma, intellect and best of all humour! My favourite movie of his is 'It Happened One Night' (1934) where he stars alongside Claudette Colbert in a fantastic tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy, back when romantic comedies were ridden with innuendos and insatiable wardrobes. Claudette plays a rebellious socialite who decides to run away from her father in an attempt to forge her own life and decisions, along the way whilst taking the Night Bus she encounters Clark Gable who plays a hilariously vindictive charmer.. I shant spoil the plot but it's worth a watch! Here's my favourite scene... Gable smoking in bed whilst it's raining outside.. what a dream!

I'm sure many of you know this one but for those new to watercolouring - and it isn't so long ago that I was a total beginner, and I'm still no expert - this may be worth knowing and it is that a white tile makes an ideal palette when working with AquaMarkers. Here's a photo of mine after my watercolour session. I've not washed the paint daubs off because a wet paintbrush makes the paint usable again - no waste!

As it happened, Hermel still had Ishcandar’s pouch which had a large amount of iron pieces in it, but he had no intention of spending any of Ishcandar's money. He just took it to teach the Hobbit a lesson. But he still planned to go to the Guild Hall and get his payment for the successful accomplishment of their last mission, which was to help Jeremy save the Hagglesmiths. That being done, he expected a handsome reward.

Georgia and I headed to the Indie Twilight Markets on Friday, located in King George Square. There were so many good stalls, obviously it’s not for everyone but if you have a good look around there certainly are some great buys. Alot of the stuff would be great as gifts, I certainly had a few friends in mind as I browsed through.

I had a clever idea about getting to know the murder victim before his untimely demise. It was one of my first plot ideas. but the cost of getting to know this very minor character is a glacial plot line and no action for way to much of the early book. Yes it would be great for the reader to know this character but it isn’t necessary to the plot. But I like the idea. It is a sacred cow to me.

Today I tried to write out invitations for a birthday party that will always be exactly a week from tomorrow. Every year.
Over and over, I had to keep reminding myself to ignore the bag - my weak hand wanted to press it back to my chest/get it out of my way or support the flopping from the weight of the addt'l items, or reach to the pit to assist in the punching outward. No, no - we are done with the bag - ignore it, now and shoot! That took time. And I admit I had to practice that draw and pivot quite a few times to stop the "rowing" motion. But then it was a full length 1911 and not the one I carry daily. It took a few extra inches to clear the bag. I feel confident I can more easily clear the bag with the Champion length...
I forgive myself that I have accepted and allowed myself to feel ashamed of me as judgement and for not allowing myself to see that this ‘badness’ that I feel is me in judgement of myself as judgement.
That’s the trick to this and all of my Bab’s dishes: patience. I’m learning quickly that the most delicious things in life take time and the best recipes on this blog will never be quick-fixes. She told me earlier this week that she talks to all of her plants so they feel love and don’t get lonely. She cited an incident with a certain aloe plant where she overwatered it then repented for weeks with many a monologue. The point is that she brings care and attention to her food and everything in her life. Tonight I went to her great-grandson Danya’s violin concert with her. Danya is 13 and has a few concerts a month and my babushka doesn’t miss a single one. She takes two buses to get there (about 45 minutes of transit with the waits) and sits through an hour of other kids’ pieces for about 6 minutes of Danya fame. Her patience and willingness to put in time continue to impress me and I’m sure I’ll think back on her fondly some day when I’m eating raw oats with a spoon because I’m too lazy to even microwave them.
It went well overall though. And I’ll be getting a call from them about some new treatment that might be available for osteoporosis but that may also be helpful in improving my risk of fractures caused by the Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI).
But they never sounded quite so nutsy as Huntsman when he accused Perry of “treason” for not building a border fence. Either the Utah governor is suffering from a cognitive disorder or, more likely, he deliberately misunderstood Perry’s position on the border. But he certainly seemed over-heated. Of course, what Huntsman was really trying to do was define Perry as the dangerous one because he had used the word treason in association with Fed chairman Ben Bernanke. But the word flew back in his face.

I love being able to see everything, so I know when I'm running low on an ingredient and can put it on my shopping list instead of finding out that I'm almost out when I need it for a recipe.

Know how to be drunk in public. You wouldn’t think this would be such a hard skill to hone, but for some it must be. I love being outside, listening to music and getting a little toasted just as much as the next person; however, there is no need for puking on strangers, having angry drunk fights or finding it acceptable to form a circle of friends around the “pickle in the middle” that is peeing in daylight right next to the beer tents – NOT COOL.

The twentieth century took our progress to a whole new level, giving us cars and superhighways, wings to round the globe in a day, and new mediums of communication to do it in mere instants.

Agile follows a cycle from Product Visioning, Roadmap, Release Planning, Iterations, Daily Stand-ups, Reviews and Retrospectives. It contains the roles required, the steps in each process at a high level and the exclusions from practice, such as, not using Daily Stand-ups for status, appraisal and so on. It tries not to be prescriptive and allows for flexibility. The CMM also provides the entirety of a Development Lifecycle, and while not explicit, seems to lean towards a “waterfall’ approach. It defines “What” needs to be undertaken, in a prescriptive fashion. Failure to adhere to a “What” specific prescription implies that you don’t satisfy the goals of that particular process area.

Scot Meacham Wood - The thing that excites me the most at the moment is the complete lack of rules and ‘trends’ in design right now. There is such abundance and endless variety. All of my clients are looking for something very specific to their lives and not feeling any need to confine the ‘look’ of their home to any specific trend. Seeing that design has no boundaries, no restrictions, is a thrilling place to begin each project.
In other words, nobody really knows. The consensus is this: when in doubt about whether or not two words should be hyphenated, consult the dictionary.
Yeah, there are. And those are not accessible, either. Scholarships work as reimbursements meaning if you don’t have the money then all the scholarship in the world won’t help – because you still don’t have the money up front to get there, to buy a plane ticket, or to even know if you’ll have enough to get pay for the room you reserved. Additionally the only YAs who get to go multiple years in a row are the YAs who can afford it. You cannot get a youth/young adult scholarship two years in a row (or it’s “very unusual”) so you’re pretty much out of luck unless your financial situation changes dramatically from one year to the next. Or you get to attend when you can get a scholarship while people who have money get to attend every year, making more of the decisions, and having a bigger influence on the direction our association is going. Even in the YA realm we vote on one of our caucus co-mods each year and if you’re not there you don’t have the chance to be one. People who get to attend each year have a much higher chance of getting appointed, elected or asked to be on something because they GET to be there.

Dear Free-Range Kids: Just thought I’d let you know of this snippet from the most recent All You Magazine. It incensed me to the point of writing an email to the author scolding her for her “professional advice” (this column is written by “Relationship Expert” Nancy Carol Rybski, PhD). Here is the article:
Other examples of promotional garbage I came across - or which came across me - are an e-mail this morning from some people called the Advertising Club. They are nothing of the sort. They are some recruitment people who want me to take part in a salary survey.
And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.

Er. Hmm.
So, after this whole Ark ordeal, Noah apparently starts himself a vineyard and imbibes a little too much. And by a little too much, I mean that this is the Bible’s first story about a killer bender. He ends up passed out, naked in his tent. I wonder if he had some fellow partiers, because usually only the truly stupid things happen when you are drinking with friends. Somehow, he decided to chuck his clothes, even if this was a one-man show.
I sat around all day today watching the fourth season of The Wire, the best TV show and/or film ever made to this point IMHO. I'm sure it would amused some of you greatly (ahem) to see me gleefully sniggering or captivated with jaw slackitude. Dear lord I love that show. And in a couple more days I can start watching Season 5!
The criticism is all born out of a little envy of course, and that's no bad thing really. It's more satisfying to pick holes in people doing great things rather than admit that they are just better at what you do than you are.
Antoine’s story is an intertwining half of another taking place forty years beforehand, where Jacqueline (Vanessa Paradis) cares for her son, Laurent, with Down syndrome. If the present day scenes scream ‘The future is now,’ the portions may be set in 1969 but might as well have been any other decade, Jacqueline and child in earth tones walking the unwashed cobblestone of Paris. Her working class conditions also seem impervious to the Yves Saint Laurent Mondrian dress that another mother in her school wears.

(Author's note: What the Hell is this shit you may be asking. Well in the last six months I have seen two "non-fiction documentaries" on how the United States government and the rest of the world in general would respond to an alien invasion. Both shows had some serious real scientific talent speaking about how we could defeat a far more advance technological species trying to take our planet. One show was on the Discovery Channel and the other was on National Geographic. I have included You Tube videos to both shows so nobody will think I have gone completely off the deep end. This story is a prequel to a similar one I did for Friday Flash Fiction several months ago. On a deeper level I wrote this story just because I was stuck at the house and freaking bored out of my mind. Leave comments if you make it to the end of this incredibly ridiculous story.)
But, again, it's HIS and thus my gift to him.
Then, I drank a beer. Yay for that. Which inspired a series of not funny jokes that started to seem funny the more I drank. Yes, I was a wee bit tipsy off of one Bud Light Lime. I’m not ashamed to say it. The jokes went like this, “I can’t get pregnant, but I can drink this entire beer in my pajamas at 4 in the afternoon.” I kept making the jokes about everything and finally DH joined in.
It's kind of a strange system that Mrs. H has put in place here, and one that always leaves me scratching my head wondering what the heck I just got myself into...and I wouldn't change a thing.:) As they say "Compromise, if not the spice of life, is its solidity. It is what makes nations great and marriages happy.”
For instance, before you read any further, see if you can name the movies that each of the songs were in. All right - how did you do?

Dog owner’s who are not responsible drive me crazy. Most of the time when dogs behave badly I grumble in my mind about them the same way I grumble about children who behave badly. You have them teach them how to be good public citizens, they are your dogs or children, not mine. They and you by virtue of your lack of control are ruining my time. Occasionally dog owners move beyond that, when their dogs behave so badly I fear what will happen if they actually get beyond whatever small border between them and me, usually a chain or fence.

One thing to note about Disneyland, it is located near the Anaheim Angels stadium and the Anaheim Convention Center. I always check the Angels game schedule to avoid the traffic mess of people going to or leaving from a game. Also, I never leave Disneyland between 3 and 6pm. That is the 5 o'clock rush hour and the freeway is a parking lot. When your top speed is 5 miles per hour, it takes some of the fun out of the day.

The nose on this is definitely a bit different from the average bourbon. It's got some definite spice similar to a rye spice but also a sort of wet cardboard sort of aroma. On the palate, well, it doesn't taste like Uncle Ben's. The palate is extremely subtle and muted, but quite pleasant. It's also on the weak side, tasting much weaker than 45%. The finish is very light, just a bit of bourbon fumes and then a sort of graininess, really the only discernible rice-like flavor I've gotten from it (and if I didn't know it was made with rice, there is no way I would have identified it that way). This one is sort of nice in its understatedness. It's not something I would seek out, but it's perfectly nice for sipping. I actually think there is something to it, and if I were BT, I'd probably thing about further rice experiments as they could use the formula to end up with an ideal flavor profile for someone who wants a lighter bourbon.
AG: Right. Exactly. What happened was very interesting. I was stuck, as I said, I was stuck with this idea before: “How can consciousness have causal efficacy?” And now that I recognized that consciousness was the ground of being, within months all the problems of quantum measurement theory, the measurement paradoxes, just melted away. I wrote my first paper which was published in 1989, but that was just refinement of the ideas and working out details.

Propaganda campaigns may be instituted either by the government or by one or more of the top media firms. The campaigns to discredit the government of Nicaragua, to support the Salvadoran elections as an exercise in legitimizing democracy, and to use the Soviet shooting down of the Korean airliner KAL 007 as a means of mobilizing public support for the arms buildup, were instituted and propelled by the government. The campaigns to publicize the crimes of Pol Pot and the alleged KGB plot to assassinate the pope were initiated by the Reader’s Digest, with strong follow-up support from NBC-TV, the New York Times, and other major media companies. Some propaganda campaigns are jointly initiated by government and media; all of them require the collaboration of the mass media. The secret of the unidirectionality of the politics of media propaganda campaigns is the multiple filter system discussed above: the mass media will allow any stories that are hurtful to large interests to peter out quickly, if they surface at all.

- Siobhan recognises the importance of ensuring the Capital’s youth and well educated, trained and prepared for the future to become future leaders. For London to maintain its credibility as a top financial centre and global city the youth of the city must be aspiring and highly capable and able to satiate demand. Also, her pledge for a young mayor and youth assembly reflects a willingness to listen to those who can’t even vote – it is rare for politicians to seek to do anything for those areas of the population unable to vote; this is definitely a refreshing approach.

It’s like the voices in my head are trying to get me to write my autobiography. Nice idea but who the hell would want to read it? I’m nobody. I’ve not done anything fantastic and famous. I’m just another schmuck on the sidewalk with the rest of the people whose hopes and dreams are dashed by themselves, their problems, their families, their jobs, their government, or any other number of outside and inside forces. Yeah, I’m sure all of the major bookstores would make lots of prime real estate for a book about me — right in the bottom of the dumpsters. Besides, if I wrote an autobiography I could never get it published because all of the people in it would hate it and what I had to say about them at one point or another, they’d try to sue me for slander, or I’d just never get the rights to use their names or likenesses and then my book would have a bunch of blank spaces in it I couldn’t fill. Yeah, that’s going to be interesting reading.

It poured a dark, muddy brown - just this side of black, in fact. A small head that quickly faded, and some nice lacing finished out the presentation. The smell was immediately strong and recognizable: molasses and vanilla, dark malt and brown sugar ... sweet, but with just a hint of tartness. Buried deeper in the bouquet was a suggestion of pine - very interesting. The fragrance was actually quite amazing - I don't remember the last brew I had that smelled so strong. The taste was incredibly complex and, for that reason, enjoyable. It took my breath away at first, but finished with an eye-opening "ah-ha!" as I began to recognize the various flavors in the tapestry: pine again, brown sugar, ginger, smokey molasses, roasted malts, some light spice, a certain kind of "woodsy" backdrop, dates, perhaps a bit of cocoa or dark chocolate, and ... figs? Yes, yes, figs. What a pleasant surprise!I was certainly impressed with this beer. After all the adjectives have been spent, and all the similies used up, there is one thing left to say: it was just plain good. No real carbonation to speak of, which meant a very smooth drinking experience. Great creamy mouthfeel, and those wonderful smatterings of eyebrow-raising flavors that evoked all sorts of nostalgia. This is what Christmas should taste like. This is what Christmas should feel like.For its amazing drinkability, for its unique combination of Christmas-appropriate tastes, and for properly evoking a spirit of Christmas and pleasant memories, I give this beer a 9 out of 10.

yes. you read that right. people are VOLUNTARILY getting tubes stuck up their nose and down their throat (a nasogastric, or NG, tube) and having that feed them instead of actually taking in food. this is what they do in EXTREME cases for eating disorders, when people fail to be compliant with a meal plan, or when gain is needed and drinking many supplements is too distressing or dangerous for the eating disordered patient. tubes are usually used to give patients ensure, aiding in the weight restoration process. this new trend has women, mostly brides to be, having a shake given to them via feeding tube so that they can severely restrict their calories and lose weight pre-wedding.

Here's why: this one-thing-at-a-time idea eliminates that debilitating sense I often have of never finishing anything. It's a false sense, since in reality I finish all kinds of stuff, but it's also true in that I never get to rest in that moment of completion because I'm always juggling other things that aren't finished. And since some of those things might never be finished -- because I don't give myself the time to either finish them or make a well-considered decision to let them go -- I'm in a perpetual state of incompletion on all fronts.

Estée Lauder created Aliage to meet the needs of modern, independent women who bought their own fragrance, women who, “…were tired of the standard perfumes of their mother’s generation, the tired familiar names of fragrances made for a generation of women who blue-rinsed their gray hair and had croquignole waves etched into their scalps.” The fact that Jane embraced the scent her mother wore says a lot about the cultural shift sensed by Mrs. Lauder, who transformed the 1970's archetype of the "liberated woman" and actualized it in a perfume. It also says a lot about the way people respond to their sense of smell. Chypres can be highly animalic and resinous despite the presence of fruits and florals in the formula. The addition of fresh green notes infuses Aliage with a timeless quality that tempers its classic pedigree and lends buoyancy.

I think we do a great disservice to the people we share the Gospel with when we tell them that salvation is only about salvation as if redemption had nothing to do with sanctification or making us holy creatures. I think the demand that God places on our lives is best said here by the Apostle: “Therefore, in view of God’s mercy, offer yourselves as living sacrifices…” We are fond of salvation, but worship as a sacrificial lifestyle is probably abhorrent to us.

The lid keeps the liquid from splattering and secures the air tube. (Some of the instructions I've seen online, show placing the pump aganst the plastic container, this works better! It DOES get the solution moving!) The pump helps wash the metal away during the etching process, for a cleaner design.

Ross Detwiler pitched six shutout innings for the Nats, while the Washington offense scored their runs on home runs by Wilson Ramos and Michael Morse. The Braves' road to the playoffs doesn't get any easier, as they host the Phillies in a three-game set to end the season while nursing a one-game lead over the Cardinals in the wild card.

I was in over the weekend and was mightily impressed when I walked in and discovered that all eight handpumps had been taken over by fab Scottish Brewery Harviestoun which showcased, excellently, the full range of their beers on offer. For a full four days there was nothing but lovely, tasty Harviestoun beer served from the pub's pumps.

So, I've been busy trying to turn some of my beady imaginings into finished beadwork for the Midnight Garden exhibition and I think I am 'in the zone' now. A few months ago, I was wandering around a rock and gem shop and I spotted a small basket of opalite eggs. As soon as I saw them I thought 'dragons' eggs' and so I rummaged through the basket until I found the perfect one, bought it and took it home with me and then forgot about it until last week. After I had finished last week's necklace I wondered what to work on next and then my eye landed on the egg which was quietly gathering dust in the corner. Almost immediately I heard a little story begin in my head and as I listened, I learned how the very rare and precious dragons' eggs are held within protective flowers that grow in a beautiful enchanted garden. Apparently, these flowers (which are carefully tended by the fairy folk of course) only bloom on moonlight nights and the egg then absorbs energy from the moon until it is ready to hatch. Once I knew the truth, I began to bead ...

There is a school somewhere in the US (as posted on freerangekids blog), which sent a letter home to all parents warning them to be on the lookout for “stranger danger”. Some bloke who goes to the bakery (every day) had spoken to some kids who go there (every day) and this was therefore a matter of utmost concern. Apparently, the letter said “The situation is now in the hands of the police. Fortunately for us today, all of our children are safe.” What from? Doughnut Man – that dastardly kidnapper of children?
Since I mentioned natural hair, I will pause here to show you the difference. When Alicia Keys first started out she had natural hair. Her "mixed" has a much higher proportion of white (I have white great-grand peoples) so her hair behaves a lot more like white hair. Also, check out this link if you're interested. It shows several different Alicia Keys styles, natural and processed.

So does clear-sighted understanding of how our system works, where it fails, and how it might serve us better. The sad truth for those rats endlessly tapping their fickle levers is that the random reward, if it does come, may be too small and too late. This is a case where it’s imperative not to keep the faith. Rats can’t assess the situation, figure that out, and make a better choice. We can.
I spun myself around and looked down, sure I was going to fall at any second. I blinked. There I was in my bed, next to Luke, who was sharing the blankets quite nicely for once. Maybe this was one of those dreams where you're watching yourself do things from outside of your body.

So FYI all. On the fourth of September 1870, the Third Republic was proclaimed. Emperor Napoleon III had been taken prisoner by the Prussians, signalling an end to his reign but not regrettably an end to the war. General Louis Jules Trochu was named provisional governor of France but since Paris was cut off from the rest of the country due to the Prussian siege, it was actually Léon Gambetta who ran things from Tours. The Third Republic somehow survived the war and continued until the Nazis arrived in 1940.
I wish to do things which will give me happiness and will classify as having done something which if I wouldn’t have done then I would have regretted later. But whether this will give happiness to the people who are part of it? If not, then this will be utter selfishness on my part and I would have done something solely for my happiness, rather than the people who could have been part of it.
She hugged his arm and rubbed the side of her head against his shoulder. "Peace? No way! That's the last thing I'm going to leave you with."In the first one, though we're saying effectively the same thing (and everything outside the quotes is identical), there's an entirely different feel to the characters. In the first, he's studious and distracted by her presence (friend's sister) and she's trying to get his attention. However, it's not clear how he's affected, how well these two know each other, whether her rather attraction/distraction is deliberate or innocent. In the second, it's wordier, but we have a better sense of both him and her. You can get a sense of offense from being characterized as studious (and responds with an attack on her perceived frivolousness). Clearly, they know each other as more than just passing acquaintances. Just as clearly, she has some knowledge of her effect on him and is doing it deliberately.

We headed toward Doolin after our stop at the Rock of Cashel. We wove our way through Limerick, but didn't stop due to the advice from previous travelers. We only had a few hours until it would be dark and we were hoping to arrive sooner than that. Not to be. As they say, travel in Ireland does not go at the pace of the U.S. That's a good thing. It is just difficult when one is learning the limitations of driving on the left, in a stick shift, in the dark, in the rain.

Six years ago Senators—both sides of the aisle—agreed that there would be no filibusters against judicial nominees except in “extraordinary” cases. Of course, that was when the Republicans were in the majority and frustrated by the Democrats that opposed Bush’s court nominees. No filibustering was done then against judicial nominees, or since then—until now. Murkowski’s ethical stance created her vote against the filibuster.

“Confession of Christ is absolutely necessary in the Christian Endeavor Society. To ensure this are the methods of the Society adapted in every particular. . . . The true Christian Endeavorer does not take part to exhibit his rhetoric, or to gain practice in public speaking, or to show what a logical prayer he can offer to God; but he does take part to show that he is a Christian, to confess his love for his Lord; and this confession is as acceptable made by the unlearned, stumbling, lisping Christian as by the glib and ready phrase-maker. . . The covenant pledge is simply a tried and proved device to secure frequent confession of Christ. . . . Our form of confession is the prayer-meeting. Here we acknowledge our faith. . . .”

The Monkey Bar is true to its name. It’s definitely a bar, not a pub and for singles, it’s a playground. Although it’s known as a place to pick up, don’t be put off. The men are friendly, fun and usually not sleazy. The light-hearted mood makes it perfect for flirting. Catch the locals after work on a Friday, then stay for a dance. As the music gets louder, more and more non-locals will join you on the dance floor. Be careful not to get tucked away upstairs or at the short end of the bar. Just like in real estate, location counts!
Not all of our imagined spiritual experiences may be truly spiritual. Some may be mixed up with mental, emotional or even physical urges, changes or imbalances.

I had quite an accident last week. Called this friend who I have known for ages now. Recounted this…and in the midst of handling this, hung up after asking a query about where I can get the car repaired. Had I been in this person’s place or had it been a few years back, I would have received a call say half an hour or hour later enquiring if things were alright. Guess what? The person pings me when I log on to a chat module much later in the night….and asks “so did you get the car to the repair shop?!” I lost it and responded saying that the question was way too early to be answered…and this friend just disappeared! I guess I must just be thankful that this friend even bothered to ask me later on at night?!?!

A friend from the gun club is miserable in his day job and complains about everything and everyone there. He says nothing ever changes or gets better. Lately, I've been feeling somewhat the same way, but ultimately it is his choice to stay there, like it is my choice if I continue my with my employer. A career change is a big deal and it could significantly affect my family or his, but we've always lived conservatively and well within our means and don't find our self-worth in our material possessions... well, except maybe for that 1942 government issued Colt 1911A1... so if we have to walk out the door and leave it all behind... we'll make do.
But really, truly, anyone who has ever observed a successful automaton, seen its uncanny lifelike movements, confronted its mechanical eyes, any human animal remembers that particular fear, that confusion about what is alive and what cannot be born.

With each milestone that passes (1 week, 1 month, 2 months etc.) there is a mix of feeling like he left us yesterday and like he left us years ago. I can still remember every detail of his birth and every detail of what he looked like and smelled like and felt like, but as the days go on and on it is less painful and therefore feels like he passed away years ago. I am thankful however that I can look back on his birth and the time we had with Aidan with joy and happiness. It really was amazing.

Before I knew it I was back in the outskirts of Bulacan. I stepped off the bus at a nearby fastfood chain and decided to eat first before heading home. I entered the 24-hours open doors of McDonald’s and ordered dinner patiently. But when I saw how small the chicken fillet on my plate was, I lost my cool and immediately demanded for the manager. The woman who approached me was medium sized, almost as though you could call her voluptuous. She was lean, with big bosoms and eyes that seemed so villainous. But what surprised me was the look of recognition when she saw me. She is, as it turned out, ABIGAIL MENESES and she wasn’t the manager nor a crew but the owner of the said McDonald’s branch. She immediately took my plate and ordered for my chicken to be changed.

We are indeed disturbed by your letter. We knew that Mrs. Wilder had not meant to imply that Indians were not people and we did not want to distress her if we could possibly avoid it.

We were particularly disturbed because all of us here feel just as strongly as you apparently feel about such subjects, and we are proud that many of the books on the Harper list prove that. Perhaps it is a hopeful sign that though such a statement could have passed unquestioned twenty years ago it would never have appeared in anything published in recent years.

If you think that your book is going to change significantly in the editing and design process, then you probably don't want to publish it as an app first.

Bob became emotional at this. He had never shared with me or with our son the memory of the last time he saw his father (“granddad”), but he revealed that he and his brother had gone to the hospital where their father was preparing for cancer surgery. They were unable to go into the room where their father was, but they could see him through the window; he sat up a bit in the hospital bed – just as our son had done on the couch – and smiled and waved to them through the window.

While the weather has been absolutely delightful for the last two days (I actually sat outside, barelegged, without freezing!) the weeks before have been pretty icy. I'm feeling so ready for spring to break through (which would be kind of ridiculous, it's still winter for crying out loud) but until it's actually warm enough to go out in flowery dresses without tights or cardi's I'll just have to work around the temperature and find a way to bring these springy colors into my winter wardrobe! Don't we all?

Print out (or re-type) a tag with the baking instructions (at right) and attach to the jar with a fancy ribbon or piece of raffia.

Last year, I went to the bookfair, but didn't know anyone, and didn't go to any workshops. Even then, I really enjoyed wandering around, loved the atmosphere, and came home with lots of goodies! I'm looking forward to attending a bunch more this year, as well as actually contributing by being a part of one of these workshops!
I sincerely hope that everyone reading this begins losing their eyesight at some point in life (perhaps at an older age). Sure, great eyesight is convenient; no glasses or contacts needed. Quite frankly, though, such a "blessed" person is missing out on an entire different perspective on everything around them. With bad eyesight, colors blur, objects undergo an abstraction of sorts, and crowds of people become impressionistic. Also, a lack of acute visual interpretation can free one from distractions. It may seem strange to regard such a deficiency as positive, but recently, I've been inclined to spend some time with my glasses off; the stained glass and other architecture at church is nice without lines, and street lights flare up to around three times their size. It's quite pleasant, really. Or maybe I'm just too optimistic. Eh~
This is my first book by Liz Curtis Higgs, first book based in the 1700's and first book that takes place in Scotland. I didn't know what to expect other than the premise sounded very interesting. It took me a few chapters to get used to the old Scottish tongue, but once I got into it I am having a hard time putting the book down. The story, based in 1745, is about Lady Elizabeth Kerr. She was born and raised in the Scottish highlands as a weavers daughter but moved away to Edinburgh and fell in love with lowlander Lord Donald Kerr. Donald loves Elizabeth but not enough to stay faithful to her and Elizabeth keeps her pagan beliefs a secret as well. In fact, the whole family has secrets. There is drama at every turn and I really feel bad for Elizabeth, who just doesn't seem to fit into her Lowlander family. Her Mother in law, Marjory, doesn't care for her much, mostly due to her being a highlander. A war is mounting outside the Kerr household too. Prince Charles Edward Stuart is fighting to take his rightful place on the throne and when the Kerr men join the Prince's army the Kerr woman learn the hard way how hard things can get when loyal lines are crossed.

For some reason, booking a hotel in Madrid for this particular weekend proved challenging and we were out of luck with our usual preference for small boutique residences – they were all either fully booked or outrageously costly for the Saturday night. I still have no idea why, as, other than a Real Madrid football match, there does not seem to be any major event in town to justify the lack of well priced hotel rooms.

I wrote about composing "The Rose of An Grianan" in this post over the summer. But I didn't tell you that this song had its beginnings as Mom, Sheila and I walked the shore of Lake Superior in March 2010. I hummed and hummed and hummed it until Mom asked, "What's the name of that song?" Little did I know it would take thousands of miles of traveling and a chance encounter with a poetic Irish gardener to finally complete and title the song! An Grianan is the name of the beautiful, Georgian mansion where the harp festival I attended was held - it means (loosely translated from Irish) "the sun always shines here."

Note that each sweep, as it makes progress, provides fodder for the other to refine and focus itself. The physical evidence that Mister D took part in the heist (the stolen jewellery in his possession) did not fall into the lap of the police from on high. Rather, an opportunity to discover it was created through careful investigative work based on the initial top-down sweep. The initial bottom-up sweep generated no hits at all, but the initial top-down sweep narrowed down the list of all possible culprits to a strong candidate. A fresh, tightly-focused, and patient bottom-up sweep (the raid on the illicit jewelry sale) was then initiated with the desired results. Numerous examples could be given of mutual feedback between the sweeps.

At the end of the month, Jim and I are moving back to the UK. Possibly for a while, possibly for good, we'll see how it all works out. We are renting out our lovely cottage and have found the perfect family to look after it for us. They have horses, 2 huge dogs and lots of other assorted animals. Also 2 lovely children, a boy and girl, and they all fell in love with our cottage the first time they visited.
A few weeks ago I was contacted by a reader, James in Australia, who had purchased another letter by Mr. Jankowski. He offered photos of it to me to translate. I was thrilled to get the chance to read it, especially since it was accompanied by the envelope.

The "petite" saison I brewed in April is tasting pretty good so far; in fact I think it will turn out great, so I've brewed another version of it and it's fermenting now. The fermentation seems less robust (maybe cooler temps?) but I'm not worried. I'm letting it take it's time as I'm going to need more bottles anyway. There's been a funky smell in the kitchen the last few days, but it doesn't seem to be the fermenting beer, which is good.

I have also been growing some native perennials from seed and have just put them outside to harden them off in preparation for planting this spring. Here are some pictures of Heuchera americana and Heuchera villosa 'Autumn Bride' that I grew from seed. Not all of them will go into my gardens, some will go to friends and family so they can also have some native groundcover for their gardens. They are in 3 1/2" pots and there are 24 to a flat and this is just a small portion of the plants, so you have some idea of how many I have to plant and distribute! Here are some more plants ready to go out, including Baptisia australis and Rudbeckia occidentalis 'Green Wizard'. This rudbeckia is a west coast native and will do well in most zones of the U.S. and the Green Wizard cultivar is a great looking plant with flowers that don't have any petals just sepals. It looks cool!

It's a mindset that doesn't help.

For too long we’ve been taught that maturity comes with age and the number of experiences we go through in life. Dolefully, this my friend isn’t true, age doesn’t define maturity despite the fact that many people believe it does. If you’re asking, “please define mature sir?” Well, since you brought it up, the definition that most fits my point is; “Having reached full natural growth or development.” That development can be mental, we all lack maturity in some areas of our lives. There’s no such thing as a perfect human being. With all this said, let’s cut it down just a little more. We’ll know teenagers are immature in most cases, we also know that most women act or reach maturity faster than men.

In the interview Ackerman had shared that, when he was depressed about not being able to write -- and writing had been his profession -- she suggested that he write a book about his experience, and he agreed to dictate to her as he labored to find each word and phrase in the rubble that was his brain. The following day he would rework the text, and the whole project became a huge part of his rehabilitation both emotionally and mentally.

Lastly, to believe that (a) education, (b) learning, (c) schooling, (d) coaching, and (e) training are knowledge, is a misnomer.

Advancement through the various levels of abc’s listed above will generally come at a cost; but know this, Knowledge is FREE!! Knowledge is, by definition, a familiarity with someone or something, which can include facts, information, descriptions, or skills acquired through experience (practical understanding) as well as through the abc’s (theoretical understanding).

There it is. The perfect pink pucker. I've been searching high and low for the perfect shade of pink lipstick, and at least for now, the search is over. On daily basis I wear very little makeup, just some neutral or purple eyeshadow, and some bright color lipstick. No eyeliner, no mascara, no shading, no highlights, no blush. I didn't have makeup brushes, instead I used clean fingers to apply my makeup. Pale face, either matte or dewy, is my trademark. That's why I need a bit of color on my lips, so I'll have a face, therefore the shocking pink or fuschia lipstick.

Who is this Welfare Queen? Although she is not any one person in particular, she is used to define the thousands of poor mothers who rely on the state for economic aid in order to support their families. The public identity of the welfare queen situates herself in a particular intersection of society that is determined by race, sex, and class. This identity defines welfare recipients as lazy, immoral women of color, with many children, who are incapable of properly socializing their offspring and seek to use tax payers’ hard earned money to fuel a criminal lifestyle. This public identity has been embraced by many Americans over the years, as well as politicians, who use the identity of the welfare queen to establish punitive policies to control the personal and economical lives of poor mothers.

And if you look at this overall package, we could achieve a situation in which our deficits were at a manageable level and our debt levels were stabilized, and the economy as a whole I think would benefit from that. Moreover, I think it would give the American people enormous confidence that this town can actually do something once in a while; that we can defy the expectations that we’re always thinking in terms of short-term politics and the next election, and every once in a while we break out of that and we do what’s right for the country.

How do I choose a producer who will work well with me? This is a very personal judgment, but certain general principles apply. Think of this process just as you would think about hiring a new musician. Recognize ahead of time what you expect the producer to do for you and think about how someone might best help you with your project. Begin your search with some professional history of each candidate producer. Get a list of credits, listen to past projects, talk to past clients. Remember, however, that these are just starting points and the best basis for your choice will be mutual “fit”.

A few years ago, we decide to do a spa day for Anize and some of her friends.

I think maybe will do it again this year!

Last night, the wee one and I were playing Just Dance 3. It's somewhat comical to watch them, but it's something they love - and I'm all about having them moving around and playing this game, as it's a real workout.

They need to see ‘robust documentary evidence to back the claims and a clear explanation from you of its relevance and why you think it substantiates the claims. It is not enough to send references to or abstracts of documents and papers without sending the reports in full and specifically highlighting the relevant parts explaining why they are relevant to the matter in hand’.

As I was getting his clothes back on him (they make them wear the funniest little hospital gowns), I was overhearing the family one curtain over from us. The nurse was explaining what to watch for--excessive vomiting, a rash, etc.--and the mom said they knew all that because they had just had the same test the day before. And tomorrow they are going to the oncology clinic, so they'll get their test results there. The boy is on his fourth round of chemo, so they are eager to see what the tests look like now.

Is God Just a Human Invention is broken into two sections. The first section deals with atheistic claims that fall under the scientific/philosophical category. The first issue that is dealt with is the question of whether or not faith is rational. Much of the discussion by atheists that faith is irrational is due to a misunderstanding of the nature and content of faith. Thus they believe that faith is “blind, irrational and stupid (p. 19).” Whether they realize it or not, atheist attacks on the validity and rationality of faith seem to be more aimed at fideism (the belief that faith is independent of reason). “Biblical faith is trust in God because He has shown Himself to be reliable and trustworthy. It is not belief in spite of the evidence, but belief in light of the evidence (p. 21).”
7) Goals. If I don’t set some sort of goal, I’ll end up wandering on the internet or staring off into space.

Take a big juicy home grown or farm stand, locally grown tomato (to be fair to those not in New Jersey). Frankly, this really isn’t worth doing with store bought tomatoes unless they are really ripe and in season. For one large tomato you’ll need one small (or half a large) ball of fresh mozzarella. Slice both into 1/4 inch slices. Pour some salt & grind some pepper into a small mise en place dish, taste the mozz. If it is salty, then use equal proportions of salt to pepper, if unsalted, use about 2:1 salt:pepper. You’ll need about 1/3 cup of best quality Extra Virgin Olive Oil and several sprigs of basil, fresh from your garden.

The EVO has three snaps on each tab. Since the EVO can fit babies 6-35lbs, it has a Snap Flap that protects you baby from the male end of the snap when they no longer need the third snap. Since I received my diaper for review, Rena has updated the Snap Flap design. The diaper I have has a flap that folds down instead of to the side. I found these to add bulk to the front, especially for smaller babies.

I have a few amused quibbles with what we heard of the new book, and from what Winterson read, I think I prefer the fiction version ('Oranges'). She read a passage in which her adoptive mother accuses her of coming from 'the wrong crib', a crib guarded the Devil, and makes fun of the literalness of such a notion. Yet Winterson's depiction of 'Mrs Winterson', which strains for comedy that lots of the audience appreciated but I couldn't, in fact presents her as some kind of devil, which here seems like a mistake but is richly ambiguous in the fiction version.

In my day job, I work for a financial firm and I watch people pull money out of retirement accounts every day. I see other accounts too but I point out the retirement accounts specifically because many do not treat them as such, even with the 10% penalty the IRS assesses for pulling funds out before the age of 59.5. Many times, without asking, clients will go into lengthy explanations about why they need the money. Presents, a new car, a house, credit card debt, a boat, medical bills, I could go on and on. The point is they always feel a justification to withdraw their funds.

Of course, they'll probably all be picked over by then and on their way out of the stores, which is even more messed up!

Strong women heroines who defy the expectations and gender limits that define their culture amaze and often inspire. If not for women who question their place, seek to achieve more and refuse to accept the status quo, the world would be static and dull. Generic role models provide fine examples and offer direction, but what about those women who question and seek more?

The biggest challenge in moving to novel length writing is stamina, Cally thinks. 'The short stories I write tend to be about 2,000 words and I can finish one in one sitting. Writing a novel is a much longer process and I initially found it strange to spend so much time with the same set of characters. Writing a novel takes an enormous amount of determination, motivation and energy. Almost every writer I know gets to a point in a novel when they have a fantastic idea for a new novel and are tempted to ditch the one they’re working on and start again. That’s particularly tempting when you’re used to writing short stories, but you must push on and reach the end. It’s normal to fall out of love with a novel while you’re writing it but you’ll inevitably fall back in love with it again.'

Now, before I get jumped on by the many developers who are self-taught because they began their professional careers formally trained in other fields (science, engineering, etc.), I am one of you. My college training was in the sciences (Biology, Chemistry, Physics, etc.) just before microcomputers became the rage they are. Many of us, however, formerly self-studied the discipline of programming and filled in the gaps in our knowledge with most, if not all, of the subjects taught in the University programs. Others of us pursued advanced degrees in CS. If either of these describe your state then I consider that you are not a “homegrown programmer” of the ilk I just mentioned.

Occasionally, we catch a glimpse of this nature we once knew and respected, as we drive through National Parks and similar government held federal land management areas. And as we marvel at the flowing waterfalls from raged and glorious cliffs, and as we ponder the ancient forests with vigor and awe, we for a moment – a brief but glorious interval between mental anguish and societal ambiguity – we feel the real world. We release the sophistry of normalcy and breath in the fresh air and drink the clean flowing water. We revel in the web of nature beauty, barely recognizing the sense of well-being it causes… and then roll up the window and drive back down the mountain to our cities and metropolises where what we call “real life” exists. As our mental anguish returns almost immediately, we settle in until the next time we can get away from the real life and simply breath the fresh air once again.

O’Hara’s poem is very articulate on the matter. How, for instance, does O’Hara in the poem move from thinking about oranges to 12 poems, none of which mention oranges at all? How does Mike Goldberg move from thinking about Sardines to a painting without visual reference to sardines? Why does O’Hara call the poems Oranges and Goldberg call the painting Sardines?

What kind of woman would write something as disgusting as this? How much self-loathing must you be carrying around? Or are we missing the point? Perhaps this isn’t the tale of a lonely, frightened woman slinking off in shame but of a woman who is steadfast in her desire for an abortion but who knows that she will not be able to have one in her own community? In 1970, New York passed the most permissive abortion law in America and virtually overnight a new industry sprang up, promoting itself to women across the States with ad tag lines such as ‘Want to be un-pregnant?’

So here it is, one day after the last day of CNY, which is rather apt as well since this is my concluding and round-up post for all the festive baking I’ve been doing. I know many people do their cookie baking in December, because Europeans and Westerners in general tend to associate cookies with Christmas. For myself however, the cookie mania starts the month before Chinese New Year, whenever that is. This year, I’ve actually baked about 20 varieties of cookies, playing around with different recipes. Eventually I think I went back to my kampong bringing 16 types of cookies, most of which had good reviews from my relatives. I still have loads more cookies I want to attempt, but I’m shelving them for next year, and who knows, I might come up with even more ideas the next time.

It is said that the energy flows, where the attention goes, and this is the key to getting positive results in any situation. When you can actually visualize exactly what it is that you want, you fuel the energy of your creation by seeing all the wonderful aspects of it coming into reality. You can see yourself experiencing your desire in detail, imagining the events, sights, smells, and feelings around it. And, if a negative thought creeps in, you can simply erase it, replacing it with thoughts of what you want to have happen instead.

CR: The double standard that applies to young women’s sexual behaviour has always been there.

The novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray, the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward. Basil is impressed by Dorian’s beauty and becomes infatuated with him, believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil’s, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry’s world view. Espousing a new hedonism, Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfillment of the senses. Realizing that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian (whimsically) expresses a desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than he. Dorian’s wish is fulfilled, plunging him into debauched acts. The portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of aging.

The very idea of a distinction between “external existence” and “perception,” Hume says, is absurd. The idea that we are stuck inside our heads, unable to see around our mental representations, is absurd. At 1.2.6, Of the idea of existence, and of external existence, Hume writes: “Now since nothing is ever present to the mind but perceptions, and since all ideas are deriv'd from something antecedently present to the mind; it follows, that 'tis impossible for us so much as to conceive or form an idea of any thing specifically different from ideas and impressions.” It is meaningless to talk about some “reality” beyond the reality of experience since on the empiricist criterion of “meaningful” a statement is significant to the extent that it can be confirmed or disconfirmed on the basis of experience. This is exactly Berkeley’s view, stated in less paradoxical language: the Humean version of the argument that the problem of phenomenal properties is a pseudoproblem hinges, as Berkeley’s version does, on the absurdity of stating that there are physical properties when these are taken to be properties separate from the properties of experience.

After a handful of live shows with Tracy on guitar a decision was made to move Tracy to full time vocal duty and to bring in a permanent 2nd guitarist . This 2nd guitar spot was filled by long time friend Jon Procopio. With this solidified line up Dahlia Seed really came into their own pulverizing audiences in basements, bars, and VFW Halls across the eastern United States. Also, it was during these early shows that Tracy Wilson began to come into her own and became one of the most intense and powerful front women in Emo/Punk history in my honest opinion. This Dahlia Seed line up also proved to be the most prolific line up in the bands career releasing four 7" vinyl records, a 10" record, and recording a full length LP/CD entitled "Valentine Kids Liter" which would be released in early 1995 on Theologian Records.
Ok, it took me a while but I am finally in Patriots mode. I always loved the Pats but after years of working at the stadium my love affair with them faded, a lot. I don't know if it was the traffic, the parking, the traffic, the drunks, the traffic or maybe it was the traffic, but I was always annoyed whenever game day rolled around. Thankfully for me most of the games are on Sundays and since that is family day I managed to avoid working most of the worst of it. I did work two games this year (yeah thanks NFL for scheduling a home game on Christmas Eve, my kids loved that one) but with only one more home game this year (on a Sunday!!!) I know I am in the clear.

Yet some instinct towards basic survival survives, both among individuals and the country itself.
The comments of Azazi is nothing new because many people who are monitoring the activities of Boko Haram from a discreet distance including the writer have already made all these observations between the time of UN headquarterbombings and the Madalla Christmas Bombings. It was the frustrations at how government was footdragging on the issue of naming and exposing the sponsors of Boko Haram inside the PDP that led to the above article first published on the 2nd of February by thenigerianvoice.com.and by other media organisations. Azazi only reiterated what all informed sources including the PDP,CPC,ACN chieftains are aware of .By the time you are through you will understand that the ruling party actually has a syndrome of perpetual deception of which probably the Mountain of Fire Ministry (MFM) need to be contacted to conduct proper 21 day deliverance on them from the spirit of lies,pretentions and deception. Below is the replication of the article.
Australia has three basic goals for its health-care system: Equity, efficiency, and quality. Progressive taxation protects equity, although there are concerns that a two-tier system could develop. The mixed national-state governance compromises efficiency and also renders reform difficult. In recent years, quality has emphasized measurement of health outcomes, which have improved as reflected in Australia's long life expectancy.
The set was my gift to myself-- my own personal celebration-- for getting into Acadia and beginning the next phase of my life. While career opportunities took Pierre and I in two different directions after we completed our graduate education, I don't regret the time we spent together. We both learned a lot about relationships, and compromise, and when it's time to let go.
'Vespertine' means things that come out in the dark or flourish in winter. 'Vespers' also means evening prayer, which fits the semi-religious feel of songs like 'Aurora' and the use of choir through much of the album. "Being Icelandic, I'm definitely not into religions, 'cos they're authoritarian," says Björk. "But having been a proud atheist all my life, I was becoming interested in falling on my knees and just being humble. And for some reason I was listening to a lot of music that was a bit like prayers."

The presidential election remains a tough contest. Citizens United is engaged in keeping the political rhetoric heated and divisive. But reading this play has opened a committed, intelligent, and passionate dialogue in class. Inherit the Wind and Obama’s recent announcement have definitely energized many of my students to get active and make sure Obama stays in office and that “…the fool shall be servant to the wise.”

The best thing about being a talking gorilla is using your talent for the benefit of others. The circus I worked for once hired a 20-year old lad called Dave as a casual labourer for the Christmas season. He was a bright chap to be working in such a menial job and we wondered why he wasn’t at university. It turned out that Dave’s father was self-made millionaire called Brian Pricklewood, a Yorkshireman with some peculiar views about life.
A data scientist is somebody who is inquisitive, who can stare at data and spot trends. It’s almost like a Renaissance individual who really wants to learn and bring change to an organization.
On Easter weekend we visited my husband’s family in KC. I challenged my SIL to a run around her neighborhood. I knew she’d outrun me seeing as how it was her turf and she weighs less than I do. Even though I did terrible on the run, I was happy to do it. I am a nervous person and like to do a lot things by myself because I get embarrassed easily and lack some self-confidence. Hence why I’d rather run alone. But, I’m trying to change that. She’s my new motivator for many reasons which I will blog about in the future.
Since I last posted the ballerina flat slippers have been listed in my Etsy shop. You can find them here: Slippers in the Etsy Store.
Working with model-makers like Dave Tremont and Paul Wickham in the Weta shop, Broadmore produced a series of now much-sought-after model ray guns – some life-sized and some in miniature. "They're weathered," he said of the guns. "They're supposed to be antiques that have survived from another era when Grordbort was selling them."
Look, I’m not happy that the guy had a stroke and other serious health issues. Someone dying is always sad, but it is part of this life. We are all going to die.
But I've been a "good writer" all this time. I worked on a new project as advised. I got many crits, edited it for half a year. I sent it to my agent, thinking this would be my "back up," my "safety net" if worse came to worst with subs.
Also coming in 2012: The Augmentation of Hetty Locklear. Redid her cover, too. She's still in 1st draft stage. This will also be a series. A mix of contemporary sci-fi and urban fantasy. It will eventually morph into sci-fi. Right now it's envisioned as a trilogy. Folks' love for Plantgirl was its inspiration.

Last weekend I finished "The Road" by Cormac McCarthy. I've never read any of McCarthy's books and have been told the film adaptations can be a little depressing, long, slow and other such descriptions that don't really entice me into running to to read the raw materials they are based on.
I should point out this gig, and in particular Width of a Circle, despite the faults in the recording, to me it feels like the Santa Monica 72 performance, albeit being a near match for sound quality (in my opinion), but with a band playing with more panache and more self assurance by this stage.
JJ: Are you serious? I never had any idea that Chuck Klosterman even knew who I was. That’s very cool, I have major respect for that dude.

Say hello to the last block--
Serious complications follow. One paranoid alien alliance blames humanity for the Blight and launches a genocidal strike. Pham Nuwen, the man who knows about Countermeasure, escapes this ruin in the spacecraft Out of Band--heading for more violence and treachery, with 500 warships soon in hot pursuit. On his destination world, the fascinating Tines are intelligent only in combination: named "individuals" are small packs of the doglike aliens. Primitive doesn't mean stupid, and opposed Tine leaders wheedle the young castaways for information about guns and radios. Low-tech war looms, with elaborately nested betrayals and schemes to seize Out of Band if it ever arrives. The tension becomes extreme... while half the Beyond debates the issues on galactic Usenet.

Traveller couldn't believe how fatigued her legs were and she started to wonder if she was going to be able to keep up. We were travelling at around 28 kilometres per hour! Eating an energy bar every hour helped and soon they only had 30 kilometres to go. This was where things went awry.

Despite these achievements in toning down the official Air Force doctrine of “mutually assured destruction” (MAD), few at RAND were pleased by Wohlstetter’s eminence. Bernard Brodie had always resented his influence and was forever plotting to bring him down. Still, Wohlstetter was popular compared to Herman Kahn. All the nuclear strategists were irritated by Kahn who, ultimately, left RAND and created his own think tank, the Hudson Institute, with a million-dollar grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.

The Italian Chicken Bake, on the other hand, left a lot to be desired in my book. It took longer than necessary to cook and just wasn’t what I was expecting…well, they can’t all be keepers.

A couple of years ago I attended an alfresco performance of King Lear. The “on the run” factor is intermittent throughout the course of the play. Instead of a curtain opening on the next scene, the next scene opens on a different stage…usually about 50 feet away. Approximately every 15-20 minutes, the audience follows the actors to different stages for new scenes of whatever play is being performed.

4) These classes are physical. It is considerably different from reading FM 7-8 when you get outside, strap on your battle rattle, and have to run the drills for real. 3-5 second rushes, low-crawling, high-crawling, and humping a ruck are physically taxing, exhausting endeavors. That DOESN'T mean you have to be a young, 20-something physical stud to perform them (although it sure doesn't hurt), but a modicum of preparatory physical conditioning will help you get more out of the class, since you can focus on the lesson, rather than on how bad your chest wants to explode. That having been said, do not be afraid to take a class, just because you think you're too old or too out of shape. For one, you will see where you need improvement, and second, even if you decide you are too old, or too far gone to be of any use in a fight, you will still have the knowledge to pass on to others.
I have three events between now and then – a webcast with Nuix, an eDisclosure seminar with Hobs Legal Docs in Manchester and the eDiscovery track at the Computer Privacy and Data Protection event in Brussels – on consecutive days next week. There are a couple of papers to write and, in addition to the product news, there is an endless stream of interesting and important articles coming out every day by others. Oh, and I have just taken delivery of a MacBook Pro, which will transform productivity and open the door to a wider range of media, including video – but only once I have set it up. I have not even opened the box yet.

I just wanted to do a quick post this morning to catch up on all the work I have been doing lately as well as make a little announcement.
But it is them who get trapped. Jesus tells them they do not know God or the scriptures, we read the Bible all the time, but do we actually understand what we read? Or do we read to support what we already believe? Or do we only comprehend or retain what we read that supports what we believe?

In the case of the personal offense, I can, if I choose, extend forgiveness. It will likely serve as an essential step in rebuilding a broken relationship. It is most effective if the offender communicates regret over their actions, can articulate what they have done, and actually requests forgiveness. My forgiveness does not mean I can (or should) trust the person again immediately or ever. Forgiveness does not give me permission to overlook reality. Also, personal forgiveness is often a private matter.
In the end, what can we deduce about Herzog's auteur-like motifs? He's either crazy himself, super enlightened, has done psychedelics, or--most likely--all three, in addition to hanging out with a lot of messianic schizophrenics. Because otherwise he'd never get so many details of the horror of the devouring maternal Dionysian Kali goddess other so very exactly right. There wouldn't be the terrible realization that the hallucination of a giant mantis alien sucking the psionic marrow out of your third eye isn't actually a hallucination but the only real thing there is, and the ability to see the way blood runs in rivers just behind the thin adhesive bandage of aching skin walking down dangerous streets and hurtling in steely cars towards crushed oblivion is no easy thing to bear.

This in turn suggests that it is a mistake to regard art history as primarily a succession of styles, each displacing the one before it. Instead, it is a continuum where specific instances may be just as valid now as they ever were. Further, it suggests that the canon is not usefully understood as timeless and static, but as contingent and shifting.

A focus on Paul himself. Paul saw himself as a role model in the sense that his life was patterned on Jesus. (9) Do what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, and the God of peace will be with you. Paul had previously written in 1Cor 11:1 Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ. He believed he was a person of integrity because he followed the example of Christ. In this letter in Php 3:17 he encouraged his readers to follow his example and also the examples of all those who like him, kept their eyes on Jesus. Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us.
For those of us who carry an ache in our hearts about the final Padmavyuham episode,,, Vyasa tells us that Abhimanyu is really the son of Chandra, who initially refused to send Abhimanyu to earth to fight in the war against all the Rakshasas and other bad guys. When he was pressurised, Chandra agreed to send his son for a very short time. And in that time Abhimanyu would kill as many bad guys as the rest of them would kill in their longer sojourns on earth. I hope this makes you feel a little better about Abhimanyu.

So, the goal for the next quarter…. run 100 miles a month. How hard is that forcryinoutlloud? 25 miles a week. No sweat. I’ve also added in some strength training (it IS almost bikini season after all) and so I’ll have a little break from running a few days a week to avoid burn-out. But, I must keep my promise to myself. I need to be able to keep up at least 25 miles a week before marathon training starts in June! Also, I need to maintain good fitness for the half a the end of May.

She tells me about the house. The maid is the only one she’s seen, and she spends a great deal of time inside. She draws the curtains, so Josie can’t see what she’s up to. That surprises me. I expected a lot more activity. Josie asks if she should go inside the house. I don’t think she should alone, but I know she and the elf don’t like each other much. I hear what he says about her, no doubt she tells Big Guy similar about him. I suggest she try to get a sniff before we resort to that, and she agrees. And she doesn’t hate the elf now, she says, she’s learned to ignore his stupid remarks. But she says he’s quieter now, he doesn’t talk as much. I’m not sure what that means.
Although I took a mini-break during Firelands and missed our Fandral kill, once we were progressing through FL, we had some speed bumps but nothing like Ragnaros.

Back to talking about the gym…..I forgot how fun it is!. I use to go all of the time a couple years ago when I was in college. I get in the zone when I’m in the gym and I do a better workout. Plus, I get to do some strength training with my cardio. And let me note, yesterday when I was at the gym this chick was there with her boyfriend and she was lifting the maximum amount of weight she could on everything! I would use a machine and after me she would sit down and double the weight. That is not how you lift weights ladies (unless you want body builder muscles or man muscles). If you want your muscles to be lean but not bulky, you do less weight and more reps.
Seems kinda final- enough to make anyone go a just little bonkers.

I don’t care much for duality. Black and white bores the fuck out of me, honestly. Shades of grey? Billions of shades in the light spectrum, so many we can’t even see them all is more like it! Sure, a cursory understanding of right and wrong is necessary for day to day living, but many things can be fundamentally true whilst opposing other profound truths. The world is full of multitudes, and there is room enough for contradictions. Now, knowing I don’t care for simple 1 vs. 1 dualities, how then, do I pray to, and fairly reflect on the epithet of Dionysus Diphyes (Two Natured).

I have to say, I don't think I have a lot of tension in my life. Which is a good and a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. The tension I have mostly comes from the inner conflicts with myself and the tension I feel while writing a story.

Add pears and cook for 15-20 minutes until golden, turning occasionally. Remove pears and resrve caramelized cooking juices.

Quarter moon is for using resources gathered to take action toward fulfilling the vision, intentions, wishes, aspirations or goals.
However, Sara’s interests, unlike her parents’, aren’t aesthetically inclined, instead are more academic. She aspires to become a doctor and wants to go to the Yale University for further studies. Amrita, who started her career at a young age, wants her daughter to concentrate on studies. She does not want her daughter to take up this glamorous career at such a young age.
Gradually the realization emerged that the limits of an idea aren't defined by the budget. In fact, most truly great ideas inherently have scale. They work, somehow, at every size. As a single tweet and as a full length feature. Expectations should be set on how to spend any budget in a way that delivers a well executed idea to an appropriate number of consumers at the right time and for the right reason. Budget doesn't define the idea. Just, perhaps the scale and the expectations.
If we ever get back together, things will have to be different though. I’ll never go back to the same situation I was in. Ever. But if he wants me back, he will have to change.
I used one of Evelyn’s stretchy headbands to hold Mikey’s pacifier in his mouth since he has so much trouble keeping it in.
Fowler, who had been a member of parliament and a speaker of the Gauteng Provincial Legislature for a number of years, focused on what needed to be done in relation to the executive and parliament.
With the combination of cask and keg available it's clear that the bottom line for Craft is that good beer is good beer regardless of method of dispense. Given the popularity of Craft since it opened, it's a philosophy that appears to be working.
Person Number 2 at the Register:
Belle de Jour is the story of Séverine Serizy (Catherine Deneuve), a young woman married to a young, handsome French doctor (Jean Sorel). Their marriage seems fairly happy, and she claims that she loves him, but for whatever reason she is unable to consummate their marriage. The doctor, for his part, seems to appreciate her purity and nobility, even in the face of this marital gulf between them. Unfortunately for Séverine, this presumption everyone has that she’s some virtuous ice queen has one glaring drawback: in reality, Séverine is a latent masochist.

Then there's the character of the beer itself. I wish I could tell you what colour the finished version of this beer had. I suspect several different ones, based on my experiences with other Scottish brewers. My guess would be that it was coloured up with caramel several ways to meet the expectations of different markets. But, until I track down a document with colouring details, that's just speculation.
There are those who are savvy travelers, and those who are not. Now, I like to think of myself as a savvy traveler, but I'm sure I make mistakes, too. There are some mistakes I do not make, though. For example, I know how to use a kiosk to self-check-in and how to get through the security line quickly. I also know which types of people to avoid. Here's my basic pre-boarding procedure:
This weekend the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences will have their grand opening. They have built onto their existing building a large sphere. It will be their new Research Center. Bruce's pitchers will be among a group of pitchers that will be used in the opening ceremonies.
I do like the natural color of the wood, but this chair is going in a boring corner of the room, so I thought it needed some color. I love this emerald color that I selected, so hopefully it turns out pretty!
** In my latest version I used 2 apples, 2 pears, a generous handful of blueberries, a handful of both red and green grapes, which were sliced.
Last summer, thousands of South Los Angeles residents showed up to a job fair that brought out almost 200 employers at Crenshaw Christian Center on Vermont Avenue. The event, organized by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), was seen by some as grandstanding.
These are pictures from the powdered solid analysis. What you see are 11 of the 13 possibilities that I actually had around my house, even acetic acid (being a bread baker.) Sand (go figure) and sodium acetate were the only two I did not have.
Here, #1 and #3 are full-sized.
I've been really trying to get away from that. I don't like feeling used. I've been trying to adopt a stronger resolve, and to be more resistant when those aforementioned methods of manipulation are used on me. I feel like people will think that, when I don't cave like I used to, that I've become a harder person, that I don't care, that I'm mean, and I don't like that much, either. But I'm not sorry for becoming stronger, I think it's a good thing. In a roundabout way, it's actually allowed me to be a much better wife and mom, and I can't be sorry for that. I just don't want to be the girl that allows herself to be so manipulated anymore.

The twist can be new information supplied at or toward the end of a story that seems to change the entire story’s meaning, as in a story like “Man Overboard.” The twist can also simply be a provocative turn in thought, as in “She Suspects” or “Sparkly Blue.” Sometimes the twist can be confusing, but still provocative, as in “The Houseguest” or “The Big Game.”
I failed to catch some of your questions about Elluminate earlier in the week. Because the chatroom install has proved to be a little glitchy, and because I failed to include everyone on the team rosters (sorry, Stephanie – you’re officially Team 3!) I think it’s only right I extend your Week 5 assignment deadline.

Among the crossdressing/transgender community the question of feminizing hormones raises a lot of eyebrows. Many of the medical documents on the subject seem to have been written only to cause more confusion. But the truth about Estrogen and Anti-Androgen hormones is that they really take little effort to understand.
This is what we plan on munching on this week :)
We have done nothing this weekend. Friday evening I did get Drew to go out for a little while. We got (free) milkshakes from Chick-fil-A and went to the mall so Drew could spend a gift card at the Deacon Store. We also went to Barnes and Noble for a little bit and then headed home. Saturday the kids and I headed to Sam’s Club and then stayed inside watching movies all day and night. It was so cold and windy we didn’t want to go out! Today we had church and we’ve got no plans either.

"Recently there was a news report quoting a state deputy chief minister as saying the poverty rate in Sabah has dropped by 7%. Do you believe this?
Kimberly was a VERY VERY EXTREMELY busy lady!! Therefore, after many attempts to contact her for a meeting she was still just WAY too busy. Come to find out later, Kimberly is a nurse here is Houston and that explained why she was just SO incredibly busy all the time.
Well, this exhibition has 22 of the original Ford Times screen prints from the 50's and 60's hand-printed by the Harpers in their basement, along with some later prints from the 70's and 80's printed by the studio.
Usually, I just nod in agreement when someone expresses their desire to deploy, fully knowing that they’ll never really leave once they’ve been there.

For those who haven't seen it, if you're a regular Grits reader and are interested in the topics this blog covers, I encourage reading the TDCAA forum purely for its entertainment value, as evidenced by the quotes pulled out by the Watchdog. (Their site appears to be inexplicably down, hopefully not in order to expunge years of dialogue as a result of the Watchdog's post!) A lot of interesting discussions happen at the TDCAA user forum on subjects I don't see addressed anywhere else, for good and sometimes for ill. One caveat: Before ever quoting the forum, as the Watchdog did, always get a screen shot or cut and paste the string into a separate document. Mr. Bradley in particular, but other forum participants, too, have been known to change or delete comments when they were cited in the media.

The Ellen Show (which is taped on the Warner Bros. studio lot) was the first to debut the footage from Dark Shadows, but the footage comes in snippets and flashes, so its hard to get a read or draw the tiniest reaction from it. Styd confirms that the first trailer for the movie arrives on Thursday.
This will be the last collective tribute to Hitch, although there are a few miscellaneous items I’ll post soon, and a special musical tribute tomorrow. As you might have expected, most of the tributes to the man involved amber restoratives, and I’ve put the remaining ones here.
The only way I can explain the persistent ability to so completely ignore the obvious is that this must be the proverbial pink elephant. An elephant that can appear and disappear based on one’s level of alcohol intake. But don’t be fooled, that pink elephant is on a 24/7 eating binge!
