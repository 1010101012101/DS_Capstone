My favorite blossoms in my backyard… That is a difficult question. If we are counting dandelions, they are in the running but lilacs and pear blossoms are equally as wonderful and last for even shorter amounts of time. Perhaps even the tiny flowers on my tomato plants that give off that unmistakable scent? As you can tell I really enjoy things that grow :)
Fast Retailing was the strongest performer of the leading global clothing, footwear, accessories and luxury goods retailers. The company’s strong performance was driven by the high scores it received across all the pillars.
I chose my travel attire carefully, even more so than usual. Black Brooks Brothers blazer with black buttons. Tan wide wale corduroys. Wine colored long sleeve merino wool knit shirt. Pink and wine patterned pocket square. I was influenced by two factors in these choices. That we had to fly to Newfoundland before turning east toward Europe. And that the weather in Paris for several weeks prior to my trip had been nothing short of awful. That led me to also pack a light trench coat, a black lightweight waterproof shell, and the L.L. Bean weatherproof lined ski jacket that I bought for my Wisconsin trip last December. All choices that turned out to be providential.

He somehow climbs up to the top of that structure and then makes a beeline straight to the brick chimney on the side of the school. Now if you ever noticed the chimney of PS 130 it has these insets that almost look like steps. They are about one or two feet away from each other and go all the way up to the top. So Shawn gently places the toe stop of his skates on each step, and wraps his arms around the side of the bricks and starts to slowly scale his way up.

Anyway, this holiday season our hands are tied. We’ve already decided we won’t be buying gifts, not even within the confines of our immediate family, not even for our kids. We simply cannot afford to this year. I’m actually looking forward to the challenge of coming up with something I have on hand or can make for my children. Holidays like Christmas have nearly lost their meaning in the midst of rampant materialism, at least in my opinion. It will be nice to take another step back from that.

4. And finally, have you ever thought about why we might all have to live off our food storage in mass? I can think of a lot of scenarios (plague, famine, widespread destructions, total economic collapse, etc) and none of them make me think that on day 366 we will get to go back to the grocery store. It seems much more likely we will be growing our own food like wheat, beans, rice, etc. I would just rather already know how to use these foods because I had stored them, and my body is used to eating them.
“To express our good faith in response to the visit of Special Emissary Manuel Roxas and the most recent measures taken by your government, we will immediately lift the restrictions on visa applications for all Filipino workers and resume the method used to process their work permits prior to Feb 7, 2011. Online visa applications will also be applicable to the Philippine tourists as that used to be before the incident.”

I was pleasantly surprised to find that I loved this Thursday Next book. Like the second and third, this adventure takes place nearly entirely in the Bookworld, whereas the fourth and fifth are more concentrated in Thursday’s Real World. I clearly much prefer the Bookworld. This book is narrated by the fictional Thursday, as the real Thursday is missing shortly before crucial peace talks between Racy Novel and Women’s Fiction. Oh, how I’ve missed the Bookworld. I’m also cheered to know that there will finally be a new Nursery Crime Division book, albeit in 2014. Mr. Fforde seems to be focusing much of the next two years on the Dragonslayer books, so I’ll definitely have to read the first and see if I can get on board with that series as well.

I once belonged to a parenting forum that I left because of the extreme beliefs expounded there. One experience was in a discussion about praise. It was very much an anti-praise group. A mother was telling a story about what she saw in a store. A child had picked up a jar and placed it in the trolley, and his mother said to him, "Good job!".
I’d never been so far from home, ever. Not to mention with two little kids — German was, oh, 18 months or so, and Caribou was almost five.

While some students have concerns about the kinds of materials they will study and the methods which are used to present the lectures and other materials, there are some wide choices out there in the online university world. Choose the kind of lecture and other materials that you are most comfortable with and from which you take away the greatest amount of knowledge.

Though as this is taught to be possible to do, you are also said to likely bump into sinister beings who will try to mislead you from the path. These teachings explain how to transform yourself into a spiritual being and every spiritual being that exists is said to have done this work, have transformed themselves into beings of light. The sinister beings are also said to have made themselves into the way they are, have transformed themselves into beings of darkness. And when you call on a Master in the astral, the sinister beings are said to sometimes come to you, trying to pretend that they are the Master and try to mislead you. I have heard stories of this and people say that sometimes it is very obvious, like the sinister being is trying to look like the Master, but fails so hard to do so. Anyway, there are recitations that one can do which are said to get rid of any sinister being. This can be used to get rid of them and also to check whether or not you are encountering a spiritual being or if it is a sinister being. As sinister beings are said to disappear when doing these recitations, the spiritual beings do not.

Like any bride, I wanted each object to have an importance and there have been happy coincidences along the way: The 1960s dress & jacket I chose for ensemble #2 comes from Lizbeth Jeanne, a dress shop in Toledo, Ohio, where I was born; the earrings I fell for at first sight are a vintage Farrah Fawcett design—a woman of strength and beauty. It was kismet to find an unused “Orange Blossoms” vintage wedding album from 1942. We look forward to hand writing our story inside.

ABOUT THE RESTAURANT and THE FOOD
I am a very visual person. I actually like watching movies more than reading books. This is bad because I’m a writer. Visual references help me describe something. When I can’t describe something, I just write ‘it looked like this,’ then I draw a picture. Drawing before I write about something helps me. It is an aid to my imagination and at the same time drawing serves as a break from writing. I like using colored pentel pens, colored pencils, or colored pens (usually gel pens) for my drawings. I usually draw using a pen not a pencil. The drawing need not be perfect, so I do not need to erase it or perfect it. It is just crude, raw drawing.

My fear increased after partygoers at our house told me scary stories about our “haunted” house. They pulled back a rug in our rented home and showing me a bloodstain. “See, someone died in this house,” someone said. “If you listen carefully at night, you’ll hear the cupboards open and close. If you happen to wake up deep in the night, you might even hear an old lady rocking in the attic above your room.” Even though I didn’t know what prayer was or who God was, I shivered as I prayed prayers to ward off ghosts and creaking rockers.
I had the same experience with cycling recently. I posted some nice comments on a fellow racer’s Strava.com “blog” about one of his rides. We vaguely know each other and he commented back that I also had some nice times, especially for someone who never did any road races.
Journaling/Bracket template and cut out a couple of shapes and then used a smaller template to cut out tabs to hold the book mark in place. Some ribbon thread through the hole punched in the top and then a quick monogram with some velum stickers. To finish them off I added a music note I punched out of vinyl.
I make rough measurements, but I’m not one who really bothers with gauge. I know, it’s probably a bad habit for a designer. Then I begin to think about how to actually knit and construct what I want to make. I sketch out where to make increases, decreases, and all that jazz. If I’m feeling really stuck, this is when I do a little research. Say for example, I wanted to design and knit a vest and couldn’t figure out how to make armholes (I have yet to attempt one.) I will look up numerous patterns and compare how each one makes armholes and adapt and mix and match them to my liking. Once, I have a rough idea about the pattern, I just dive into the knitting.
But I still have a long way to go. Baby steps.

Now I am counting the hours left for S to come back from his travels in Sindh. He is in Jacobabad, Sukkur, Dadu. I lose track. He tells me on the phone something about data. The children are dancing around me. They want me to play 'Zoo Zoo' and I tell them I will play when I am better. A begins to cry. R tells me Go to your room and lie down. I know its better that way. To be alone with your sickness. To twist and turn.

I walk in the door and me motions for me to be quiet. He’s on the phone with his girlfriend. I lean across his bed and listen to him lie to her. When he hangs up he walks over and smacks me on the ass. Hard. I stand up and let him hug me. He leans into kiss me and meets a cheek instead of my mouth. My mouth doesn’t want him.

Well it would appear today is going to be a bit of a failure. I didn’t go to bed till 3 am last night. When I tried to go to sleep, I was too scared to actually sleep for another two and a haf hours. I woke up at 3 pm, having missed my course for finding volunteering work and am now sat in bed blogging. well at least I’m managing that. Going to town to get my new medicine is probably a bit ambitious for today. Swimming tonight is definitely so.
I had 3 different kinds of leftover icing in my freezer. (Why do I always keep these 'little bits' of icing? So I can make a variety of iced biscuits I guess.)

I just think it is unfair that so much talent is undervalued. I think we, as artists need to work together to shift a mindset. After all, we'd go out for dinner and happily pay £30 for a meal that's gone in 30 minutes. We'd pay £8 to see a movie, £40 for a skirt, £100 for a pair of boots.

To be honest, I always have some doubts when venturing into vegan restaurants...I think I've got scar tissue from visiting Cafe Gratitude several times in the Bay Area. (It's not the mostly raw food, although I do like warm soup, it is the names of the menu items.)
I don’t know that I wouldve let Rob, Nancy or even Hope get this far… but alas, the group is not as strong as past seasons in my opinion. However, if ’shockers’ and upsets hadnt gotten rid of David Arquette, Chynna Philips or even Kristen Cavallari… we may have a stronger final group.
Incidentally, one other great thing about this dress and the other two was the way the cut flares out at the bottom. I have a long stride, and as I’ve mentioned previously, I frequently run into skirts/dresses/jilbabs/etc that are cut rather narrow at the bottom so I can’t walk freely enough or take a long step. These dresses, despite looking slim and like there is not a lot of extra material floating around, are in fact generously fitting and do not have any issue with being constrictive at the bottom. In fact I was not only walking but running around in the park after my son with no worries at all.
He was much on my mind that morning when Hudson and I rounded the next corner and I saw something that sent chills down my spine: a white one.

Trail magic has always followed us on our travels and I wasn't surprised to feel Buddy's presence.

My lack of internet interaction skills extend to me not checking my blog’s email addresses as well. I checked my blog mail after a long time, and was surprised by some of the news that I had in it, and apologetic of others that I had not responded to.

Brown nosers are easy to spot and hard to ignore. They attempt (stress attempt) to bring you into their fold. They need constant assurance that they haven’t pissed the rest of their co-workers off by lunching in the President’s office, or being invited to every political event. But they have, and you are. It’s a natural human reaction to turn on the very person who’s getting all the attention. Did you have a sibling who received constant praise from your parents, or seemed to skirt through childhood without ever being grounded? Channel that feeling – you’re pissed at them aren’t you? It’s sibling rivalry all over again. The only difference – it’s your boss who is playing favorites not mom and dad.

In addition to discrediting Fox, BO is also trying to stop the fringe media from reporting more fairly, from doing their real job, as the network execs must surely have been considering given Fox's high and rapidly increasing ratings. Let's face it, news organizations (including Fox) are businesses first, so seeing the huge growth of Fox's viewership must have given them pause, they had to--after ACORN and Van Jones, two stories that they ignored until they couldn't any longer--consider giving in to the free market idea of supply and demand. Fox is serving up something that people want: news. No one wants to watch CNN spend one second on a "story" that fact checks an SNL skit. That's so bizarre, so ludicrous that it's laughable. And they are laughing stocks. They know it, and BO knows it. Thus the slander against Fox News. The president is trying to discredit Fox, to destroy them.

The movie as a whole is well-written and will bring you back to your carefree high school days (before you ever processed the concept of a full-time job and bill paying!). “21 Jump Street” ends well and is set up perfectly for a sequel, so hopefully there will be a second film. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have amazing chemistry, and I was impressed by Tatum’s comedic abilities. Up until this movie hit theaters, I thought he was only mostly good for eye candy, but he’ll make you laugh countless times throughout the movie. If you’re anything like me, you’ll appreciate seeing a pansy spoiled high school student with too much money get taken down, so there’s that too. As Tatum puts it, “They don’t serve Vegan in jail, bitch.”

It is, Schwab says, a “Facebook for global leaders.” For example, Japanese prime minister Yoshihiko Noda can post a video of himself — viewable only by the top two hundred — asking for help because a major earthquake has caused a tsunami that’s approaching his country. Minutes later, Schwab would see the message and call for an immediate videoconference among the appropriate world leaders to get Japan aid in the quickest way. CEOs of companies that have facilities near the impact site — there’s a Nissan plant close by, for example — could join forces for evacuation and figure out how to address interruptions to their supply chains.
I think that mathematics, computer science and engineering are much safer fields for Christians to study. My background is in computer science, and I have an undergraduate and graduate degree in that area. These areas are safer because it is much harder for the professors to inject politics into the curriculum, so that students don’t have to be forced to accept things on faith, without any critical thinking or debate. Math features answers that are right or wrong regardless of politics, and programming features programs that either run or not, regardless of religion.

Watching Virginia along her journey is sometimes painful, but it's so amazing to see her come through the other side stronger! This is another book where the main character comes to a positive ending through her own doing, rather than with help from diets and make-up, or from guys. It's wonderful! More books like this please! This really is a great story! I really recommend it!

Well, it makes me reference art house films rather than publishing, for a start. Also, when I was having huge challenges merging those two separate NaNo novels into one book, the only thing that made sense to me was Blake Snyder’s screenwriting how-to, SAVE THE CAT and its sequel SAVE THE CAT GOES TO THE MOVIES. I have no idea why. It’s just the way my brain works, I guess.

You may recall his study visit (not a normal clinic visit) revealed a 0.6 pound weight loss over a few months. This got me super busy trying to make up the difference before our clinic visit less than 2 weeks later. While we did add a few ounces, he weighed in at 26 lb, 11 oz, we didn't make it back up to his previous weight of 27 pounds. This brought his height/weight ration percentile down to the 10-25% range.

Sue began to ask her son if he was really thirteen, and he assured her that he was. "Are you sure you are thirteen?" she pushed. As he had an upcoming birthday, she wanted to make sure that the celebration was purposeful. But Jonathan exhibited no excitement about the celebration, and in fact acted like the whole episode embarrassed him. Sue found this puzzling. "Perhaps he has never had a birthday celebration," she wondered, "the poor boy." Again she asked him about his age. "Can you at least give me what Chinese sign you were born under?" she pleaded. One afternoon, after pushing him yet again to give her some clue as to when he was actually born, he responded, "China told me never to tell. China said I could never tell my real birthday."

I see this suggestion more and more from author solutions services. It is completely misplaced and misleading. Publishers and agents are not looking for submissions and queries in the form of a self-published physical book. If the book happened to have sold 10,000 copies, you might get lucky, but the chances are that you will be simply wasting your time. Unless you are a literary agent, you don’t use a printed edition of a book to sell publication rights to a publisher.

This frustrates me a bit because A. I'm impatient and B. I'm so character history obsessed, but for the most part it leaves me in awe. There is still backstory on Sons of Anarchy, it's a show with rich characters who have a lot of history, but it's only given to us in the moment. We learn about the past through dialogue. The past comes up when it's relevant to show, like when someone's former lover shows up. Still, these are places where I would be tempted as a writer to pause and let my character reflect via flashback, but on SOA they never do. You learn all you are going to learn from what the character's say, write (there are some voice over monologues from Jax's dead father, but we only get those when Jax is reading things his father has written), and from the expressions on their faces, body language, and physical reactions.

In the middle of a scene full of anxiety, fear, anticipation, joy and wonder, Mary quietly walks in and offers the worship that Jesus has been waiting for, but no one else has quite figured out. She takes a bottle of perfume worth a small fortune (an average years’ wages) and shatters its long slender neck on the edge of the table. She tips the jar and pours the oil over Jesus as he reclines at the table. The attention of all in the room is centered on her and the smell permeates the room. Their shock is deepened when she lets down her hair to wipe the perfume from Jesus’ feet, something a respectable woman would not do in public. The disapproval of all is voiced by none other than one of Jesus’ disciples, Judas. “What she is doing is a foolish waste – we certainly can think of wiser ways to use that for the Lord.” John doesn’t sugar-coat Judas’ true motives, though – he was no frugal charity worker, but a plain thief. As Mary kneels at Jesus’ feet generously pouring out her worship, here is a disciple jealously eyeing the perfume dripping off Jesus’ body. The disciples are so far removed from understanding Christ’s purposes that they are thinking of money only a few days away from his death.

One thing I learned in my ER trip was that I am a Terrible Patient. I hate being sick. I crack horrible jokes, I cannot pee in a cup upon demand, and I whine constantly for blankets. Once my fever broke I became a sweaty mess in my hospital bed, still full of aches, pains, a sore throat and whininess. BFE nodded knowingly as the nurse outed me as a Terrible Patient, as if he’d known this all along. Hmmph. Whatevs. Pass me my blankie yo.

The torture/murders caused deep anger throughout the Afrikaner/Boer community. Information submitted by police members to the news media shortly after the murder also was that the words ‘Kill the Boer’ had alsobeen daubed in the women’s blood on the farmhouse walls. However while crime-scene photographs were submitted, this aspect – providing a very clear political motive – was not raised during the trial: Hlongwane was not put on the witness stand for cross-examination.
You might think that the equinox would be the day for this day-and-night-are-equal event: After all, isn’t that what the equinox is supposed be about, when the earth is half way through its rotation around the sun and we catch that fleeting moment it is neither summer with its longer days nor winter with its longer nights? Indeed, the equinox is the day when day and night are approximately equal everywhere around the world. But there is something about the way that atmosphere of the earth bends the sun’s rays in a day-lengthening way that means that in New York City the equalizing of day and night occurs on St. Patrick’s Day, a good few days ahead of the equinox. After that, for all the rest of the summer, our days will be longer than our nights.
After Barley embarks on his mission, Ned and Brock search his Hampstead flat for clues of his ties to Goethe/Katya. They find a notebook with a Stevie Smith quote:
Robert Griffin III is electric. From his personality to his play on the field, there is an aura that surrounds him. The Baylor sensation will take his talents to our Nation’s Capital. The Washington Redskins couldn’t have been happier to hand their selection into Roger Goodell. RG3, in any other year would’ve been the clear cut number one pick. Knowing that the Colts were locked into the projected “can’t miss” ability of Luck, the Skins paid a kings ransom to pick after them at #2. RG3 himself is worth the draft picks the Redskins used to get his services. The question will be, without those draft picks, how will they surround RG3 with enough talent to succeed? Luckily Daniel Snyder will always have an eager check book, so Skins fans know the answer to that. That bodes well for Griffin and the Redskins. It will be hard to mess this one up. Annually, the Redskins win the offseason headlines. This time, in my opinion, the headlines are finally justified.
I really appreciate that Rosa never talks down to his audience. In America, we don’t particularly go in for the Disney comics, although I think they’re published here, and comic books themselves have only recently been “legitimized” as an artistic medium. Specifically, Americans often dismiss Disney, especially the animal characters, as purely for children. While I can’t speak for all of Europe, I can speak for France–my people love comic books and treat them as a respected medium appropriate for all ages. Based on how Rosa speaks about the Italian Duck universe, I think it’s much the same all over. Rosa deals with death, the effects of greed, and alienation in a way that’s appropriate for all ages but not shallow. The humor, especially, doesn’t dissolve into easy comedy–there’s plenty of historical gags and sight gags that you have to be paying attention to catch and appreciate.

I was able to sample the Viking Pale Ale and the Festivus Ale (paying homage to the Costanza non-Christmas holiday in Seinfeld), "It's a Festivus, for the rest of us!". Both were pretty good choices on my part and I would love to stop back and tick off a few more for my beer list. My only concern about the beers is the number of beers on tap. While having a choice is a great thing, my worry is that with so many beers to attend to, does the quality suffer? I can't answer that question now because I've only had the 2 to think about, but it is a question that I will bring back with me on my next visit.

Earlier in the day, I sliced up the strawberries, drizzled them in agave nectar, stirred them around in a small but deep bowl, and popped them in the fridge.

This collection was a side project. I couldn’t focus totally on it for any length of time. While writing fiction during my MFA, I would only spend a day, here or there, on these poems. If I spent much longer than a day or two at a time, my creative brain would shut down and my thinker brain would try to take over. I couldn’t let that happen because I really wanted this to be a creative project, not a political or judgmental one. For example, Judy Buenoano, the Black Widow, is a woman I researched and studied; she still haunts me, but I couldn’t write anything worth putting in a collection because I had begun to judge her. I hated her, and the writing was awful because of that.

Oh, the separation is always painful. We freak out at the experience of something new and unfamiliar, even if it seems less painful. Well, they weren't as smooth as satin, but they were smoother, all the same. I was still freaking out, because I was afraid to let go and fall into the abyss.

My personal experience with Charismatics is that early in my Christian walk I attended church with a friend that had a prophecy and tongues as a regular part of their service. After that I had little thought until I spent some time on Sam Storms personal site. I’m still open on my theology in this area. I haven’t made a decision one way or another because for me it’s a peripheral theological point. I’ve been sticking to the Gospel primarily and theology directly associated with it like the Doctrines of Grace, theology proper, Christology, etc. I understand that I should take a view because it’s commanded in the scripture to pursue the gifts (1 Corinthians 14:1). So I’ve decided after going through this series, I’ll make up my mind for my own personal theology. And if they don’t cover everything I need, I’ll pursue it and find answers on my own.

If though their actual purpose was to make ThaiCom management to re-open the PTV, and there is nobody to do that – then what red-shirts can do about it? can they do it by themselves? if not – then looks like it was useless, even though they have declared a victory.

In India, majority of people do long distance travel to various places by train. Train service is one of the well equipped affordable transportation. Longest train journey I have undertaken is took when I had to visit New Delhi, by Kerala Express. It takes about approximately about 72 hours. Train usually leaves Trivandrum on time, but somehow does get delayed by the time it reaches New Delhi. When you reach every station, you can hear vendors calling chaya kappi/ Tea, coffee and selling goodies. I don’t know how they sell quite a lot in a few minutes that the trains usually halt. There are also a few stations, you can get some special goodies, for example in Kollam it is parippu vada, at Eranakulam it is meals packet consisting of rice and curries, at Trichur it is banana chips and in Palakad it will be Halwa and Pazham pori and when train reaches neighboring state Tamil Nadu, you can get good Idly ( steamed rice cakes) with sambhar and coffee, like list goes on. Just like this in Maddur station they sell this Vada even got name after its place.
You’ve probably seen those funny videos circulating the internet, “S%*# People Say”, that make fun of the catch phrases, terms and quirky things different types of people say. I recently saw a video “S%*# Foodies Say” in which the main character declares “the one thing that scares me about traveling is not being able to eat local”. That just cracks me up, for the obvious reason of how ridiculous that statement is, and also because I hold a deep belief that one of the best things about traveling to new places is trying the foods that are unique and local to that place.

Although our journey on the prairie had only just begun it seemed as if we had spent a lifetime in the little trailer that I was working hard to keep from becoming a rat hole. As my husband walked past me without a word more I inhaled a deep breath, bit my tongue, shut my mouth and carried on with cooking the meal. Kurt went to bed, lying there fully clothed under a blanket. I served my dinner on a paper late to avoid washing a dish and wondered about things as I sat there at the table, alone, as I ate in silence. The meatballs were delicious and I remarked to myself that the Italian breadcrumbs eggs and fresh minced onion made all the difference when making meatballs in brown gravy. Maybe it was because I prefer all things Italian, how could I not? But in this case, there was no denying that the bland and basic flavor of brown gravy and ground beef rolled into balls was much improved with the touch of onion garlic basil and oregano. As I appreciated every bite of my meal I contemplated a second helping but felt self-conscious hogging the tastiness of this well cooked dinner, especially if Kurt was only lightly sleeping and could hear me going for another trip to the pan. And if he was in a deep sleep then the sound of me rattling lids to pans and scraping up gravy with the metal spoon certainly would wake him so quietly, I made my way down the steps after closing the heavy metal door with a Trepidatious click. After walking up to the hydrant to fill the water jugs, stopping by the big house to pop in and say hello to Brenda and the rest of the family, I made my way back to the trailer to drop off the water jugs and then I walked out the paddock gate to head over to the slice of land in a world that was supposed to become our new home. The dogs followed me, of course, never allowing me to go anywhere without them they were quick to tap on my heels in order to escort and protect as we walked up to the farthest corner of the land that now had our name on it. The prayer corner was the only place on earth now where I could tune everyone out enough to commune with God and be still in thought, meditation, prayer, devotion, and contemplation. To find solace, I had to walk away to my little church on that farthest corner of our pasture. Standing there, the dogs would lie down for a nap, now knowing after a full month of walking here, that we would be a while. Yes, we had been in Three Forks more than a month now so looking back was a good thing, maybe. Maybe we had achieved more than it felt like we had but then the wallet emptied out as if we’d been here for ten years. I was worried beyond fear, but praying helped me to remain calm enough that I didn’t become crazy over it. Praying helped to control my rattling nerves.

FIX??? FIX? What the heck is wrong with my eyebrows? I know she’s just trying to upsell me, but now I’m getting a little paranoid. The only person I trust with my eyebrows besides myself is my sister. The only tool allowed to come within an inch of my eyebrows is some very fine tweezers (not the cheap kind or the kind with the square tips). Anything that could remove my entire eyebrow in a shorter amount of time than it takes to say, “What the…” is not happening. No wax. No thread. Especially no wax though, because that shit hurts – no matter where you put it!

Jesus healed the sick… Matthew 9:35… (KJV) “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people.” Acts 10:38 (KJV) ”How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.” Hebrews 13:8 says, “Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and today, and forever.”

Bryan Litfin (Ph.D., University of Virginia), associate professor of theology at Moody Bible Institute, provides a much needed introduction to the church fathers for evangelical Christians. Burdened by the fact that many evangelicals lack any kind of connection to the rich history of the church, Litfin writes so that Christians will learn to think of the fathers as those who can play a guiding role for the faith today (p. 18). Every Christian should find himself on the path of orthodoxy—a path the fathers labored to create (p. 29). When Christians get to know the church fathers and what they believed, they will “begin to understand something of the grandeur of the community to which we belong…the ‘communion of saints’” (p. 29).
We would have VB for the Vics and Toohey’s for the Cockroaches, XXXX for the Cane Toads and West End for the Crow Eaters. Cascade for the Taswegians and ‘Big Chook Piss’ (Emu Lager) for the Drug Dealers, sorry, Sandgropers. The regional finals would be played as Day/Nighters with the Final at the ‘G on the day after the Grand Final. The TAB would want in on this, of course, and we’d have professional handicappers setting the markets. Good teams would have to drink strong lagers like Platinum Extra Dry, average teams could drink light and the token Gay Pride Team could drink wine spritzers, Bacardi Breezers or Coronas.

I always thought the Maid of Honor was supposed to help plan the shower & sort of take the reins of the wedding planning w/ of course the help from the other bridesmaids so the bride doesn't get overwhelmed. Somehow this wedding is so backwards and I don't know if I should feel sorry for the bride because this all seems like such a mess, but she seems to be letting it spiral out of control. I know every girl doesn't have their perfect wedding all planned out, but this bride seems to be just be hoping it all somehow works out. She has been sick for like the past few weeks too and it is definitely the stress turning her stomach in knots. I would love to know what is going on her head.
I’m still working on that one. Any ideas?
I was always skeptical of the when you know you know until it hit me in the face. And I feel there is that so done just for you.

There is a simple way to become a Buddha: When you refrain from unwholesome actions, are not attached to birth and death, and are compassionate toward all sentient beings, respectful to seniors and kind to juniors, not excluding or desiring anything, with no designing thoughts or worries, you will be called a buddha. Do not seek anything else.

We can’t reveal what we’ve hidden by cracking open the narrative shell and prying out the nut of truth. Every interpretation will only be another mask; a story about the story is no less a lie. Yet we are not completely without resources. (To echo Longinus … between story and story, between story and its translations--there flashes forth the lightning bolt of the sublime. An interpretation does not replace, it dis-places, and the friction of displacement is generative, here as on the level of metaphor. Between the visible two there emerges an invisible third, discernible not in it itself, but in its effect—in the difference it makes.

Christians should also serve. This may mean running for office, serving on the school board, helping at a community center, coaching in local athletic leagues, volunteering on community committees, or any other opportunities that come your way. We should engage, not simply the issues being debated in culture, but the actual people who make up our culture. Jesus said that Christians will be “salt and light.” Salt and light are only as effective as they are connected to what they desire to influence.

For subjects in the social sciences, though, Intute and the gateways worked much better. On the whole, students and others when searching for resources in the social sciences tend to look for more general subjects. A student might be looking for material on, for example, economics in the Middle East, or political history of Australia, and Intute was quite good at directing them to good quality websites and starting points in such subjects.

I haven’t done any serious zentangling since finishing that project, but I’ve done a few sketches in my Art Journal (yet to be photographed).

There is no photograph because he keeps walking in front of the bright light.

For while I love Yuengling -- the history, the stubbornness, the Pennsylvaniality of it all -- it is sobering to think that America's four largest brewing companies, the brands that are household words -- Anheuser-Busch, Miller, Coors, Pabst -- are all either foreign-owned or, in the case of Pabst, gypsy brewers without a home. It is a shock that the largest American-owned brewer sold only 2.5 million bbls. in 2011; that the largest American brewer is a regional anomaly.

In addition to the academic life, your personal/social well-being is a main priority.

We even tried pulling the “I just flew in from Nova Scotia” card on a Don from Newfoundland and he simply turned a blind eye. This, we felt, was the ultimate betrayal.

You can check on the status of the well by talking to the woman at the well. If she goes on about it having the sweetest well water, poison away! If it's poisoned, you may need to get the Blue Fairy Water (or ask a player to do so). For reference, the Blue Fairy Water is on the top of Thenton Tower where players need to jump off; the water is on a tile next to the stairs, just search/hit center when standing on it.

I had a hospital appointment this morning with a new consultant. Given the many years and many ways I've heard the popular diagnosis of 'its all in your head' prior to being diagnosed with a very definitely not in my head genetic collagen disorder, it is safe to say new doctors make me anxious. Hospitals, nurses and early mornings also make me anxious so I was grumpy and stressed before the appointment and very probably pre-disposed to tantrums. Spotting a doctor who had previously been so convinced I'd made up my diagnosis of EDS that he decided I'd faked the official diagnosis letter included with my notes stressed me out further, even though I knew I wasn't seeing him. Listening to an elderly, disabled man's welfare woes in the waiting room was also a joy. Especially the bit where he told me that people who get full benefits get all the services they need. I rather icily informed him that I receive full benefits but share the exact same challenges he faces in accessing social care support and inwardly wept at the outstanding political success of the 'saint v's scrounger' rhetoric.

To be honest I stumbled upon Live Connected a couple of years ago and I wasn’t sure that it was a telecommunications provider that I wanted to review.

Because this story does rock, I tried very hard to get past the distractions. I loved the setting--vampires and the old south just seem to go together so well--and as I've already said, Riley Poe is awesome. I loved the Gullah and hoo-doo aspects of the story. They felt very authentic, and really added to the spooky atmosphere and the freakiness factor. Jasper does a good job of blending the old world with the new. I'm always complaining about one-dimensional villains, but the villain in this story actually has some depth and he's very intriguing. Oh, and did I mention the hot sex? While this is another vampire story, it's different enough to stand out. A couple of mysteries that are touched upon are not fully explained, but the ending has enough of a resolution to satisfy, and it also opens up a whole new can of worms to propel Riley into the next installment, and I will definitely pick up a copy of the recently released Everdark to see what happens next. I'll just hope for fewer paranthetical distractions!

Unfortunately one major difficulty stands in the way of such a picture, and it’s one that was mentioned last week: empires attract doubletalk the way a dead rat attracts flies. Some of the doubletalk comes from rival power centers, outside the empire du jour or within it, that hope to excuse their own ambitions by painting that empire in the least complimentary colors that can be found, but an even larger amount gets produced by empires themselves—or, more exactly, by the tame intellectuals that empires produce and employ in numbers as large as the imperial economy can support. Between the doubletalk meant to make any given empire seem much worse than its rivals, and the doubletalk meant to make the same empire seem much better than its rivals, understanding is an early casualty.

My sister was perhaps not portraying a pedestrian convincingly enough a few years ago when she was struck in the crosswalk in front of Thorne's Market by a woman who was apparently simulating a licensed driver. It seems that merely engaging in the activity does not guarantee that one is a representative exemplar of the activity associated with the title. The woman rolled up her windows and called her insurance company before even getting out of the car to see if my sister was okay. She was okay. A few bruises.

On the way home Friday, I was able to swing into Beers of the World in Rochester. Huge store, all beer and home brew supplies, pretty decent selection, but nothing really crazy rare, at least that I could see. If you want it, though, 9 chances out of 10 they have it. Then on the way home I made a quick stop in Hammondsport, NY just off of Lake Keuka for lunch at the Village Tavern Inn. I stopped here on the recommendations of Nate. This small town bar boasts a huge beer and wine selection and some pretty decent food. Seems like it would be a fun little place in a town centrally located in NY wine country. It seems like a great place for a weekend getaway. I'm looking forward to finding out.

Until now I would never have copped to such a self-description, because evangelist is just not how I see myself. I grew up in a family of atheists in a small town where my sister and I were the only kids in that category; my first memory of school is having other kids ask me what church I attended. (I also learned quickly that my answer, “I don’t go to church,” was not the right one.) There were points in seventh grade (i.e., age 12-13) when I really, really wanted to believe in God or have Jesus come to me in an ecstatic moment, but both of Them ignored me. (To be honest, my eagerness for Their attention can be chalked up to my eagerness for attention from the cutest guy in school, who was some kind of Baptist.)

There’s rather more to all of this, though, than just my penchant for completing a to-do list. Because much as the will-writing, car-changing, instruction-making things must be done, they’re actually just a bit of a means to an end; a way of drawing a line through pressing concerns in order for me to move onto a far bigger resolution altogether… one which must – for the sake of my health, my sanity and my relationships – be dispatched equally as calculatedly and deliberately. Because this year, dear reader, something’s got to change. And fast.

New babies often bring questions like, “Who do they look like?” and “Where did that red hair come from? I’m here to remind you that the world can tell if we resemble our Heavenly Father or not. The crucible of suffering has a way of showing our real identity. Your reaction to what comes your way revels who you really are and whether or not you look like Jesus. Do you resemble Him at all?
When you first start writing you have lots of ideas. Then, they start to dry up; you use them up or you decide what had seemed good isn’t quite as engaging as you’d thought. Fortunately, as I mentioned the other week, I have the next four or five books planned in my head. Still, I’m not so teeming with ideas as I was when I decided TO BE A

He then reached into one of the boxes on his cart and flipped my hand so I could hold his gift. In my palm, he placed a small silver charm and said, “This is for you. For luck that you return to Rome. I give it to you. When you come back to Rome, you can give me a kiss or you can give me one now.” Laughter filled the air, both his and mine. What a little player! I promised him I’d repay the debt on my next trip.
Anyway, this one pours an inky black, with red highlights but only at the extreme edges because of how thick this one is. Not as opaque as Ten FIDY or Bourbon County, but it doesn't have to be. Good sized head on an aggressive pour that's dark brown and fades to a sheet, but stays there.

Here are two songs from The Last Waltz featuring Levon: “The Weight” and “The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.” ”Dixie” is my favorite Band song; it’s a superb concatenation of musicianship and strange lyrics that seem to emanate from a dream.
Thus the cycle turns, and, like watching some barbaric version of “back to the future", on the news we see exactly the same scenes we saw on our televisions twenty years ago, wrecked buildings, burning vehicles, mobs brandishing machetes, axes and knives hacking at everything and everyone which comes within their reach. Most horrific of all, we see the return of that most savage symbol of African brutality, the necklace where, to the cheers of a blood thirsty crowd, some poor trembling soul, with a tire around his neck, is dragged from his home and set alight, exactly as all those other poor souls were set alight throughout the Apartheid years, when we were told it was all the evil white man's fault.
Other friends cam down and so it was great to see them and catch up too. I managed to eat a bit of cheese and nuts and nibbles but had hardly any dinner. This morning I ate 1/2 egg and a few mouthfuls of bacon. My friend commented on how little I ate during the weekend. I still feel under the weather and think my band was super tight due to all my stress. I am certainly not going to be asking for a fill at my next appointment as I barely eat now.
I thought I'd share some more of the tags I've made using the techniques from Tim Holtz's online class.
How Rachel kept from fainting herself on being confronted by this nightmare is of some astonishment to her and to others, although not really to me. At root, and despite the odd psychological quirk, she's possessed of a strength of character much greater than my own and a practicality I can only dream of. If there's a job needs doing round the flat you can guarantee she'll be the one to do it, and before she met me she'd accomplished more in the ongoing trial of grown-up life than I, in my relatively coddled existence, had even begun to contemplate, despite being five years older than her.
Okay, okay,so, how do you enter?
The Trans person recognizes the psychological and emotional needs in identifying as transgendered, and seeks out other people in the Transgender community for support. This stage leads to a decrease in the social isolation of the previous stage and begins a deeper sense of integration of sexuality into one’s larger identity. The Trans person accepts his identity as part of the LGBTQ community, and makes increasing social contact. It is important to note the semantic difference between “tolerance” and “acceptance”, and this change makes up the essence of this stage transition. Other parts of this stage include trying to fit in and be accepted by the LGBTQ community and enters deeper into the process of “coming out”. But gender is also “a feature of social relationships and its idiom derives from the institutional arena in which those relationships come to life”

I began using Clary Sage in 1993 when I discovered how a few drops in the bath helped calm the emotional rollercoaster of PMS. Over the years, my relationship with Clary Sage has deepened and I feel a strong energetic bond with this beautiful oil. It not only makes me feel lighthearted, but also has a special way of opening my inner self and allowing my creativity to be expressed. (Please note, Clary Sage essential oil has important safety issues associated with it. Do not use without first consulting a professionally-trained Aromatherapist.)

February we started seriously looking for a new place to live.
DE: There isn’t one. I’m erratic. I have ‘hot’ phases when I manage 500 – 1000 words a day or even more, usually starting about mid-morning and (with breaks of course) stopping around six, though I do sometimes write at night. But I have ‘cold’ periods when I’m slow to get myself to my desk and either fritter time away in displacement activities of one kind or another or brood about an idea. Luckily, I enjoy the actual process of writing and feel unhappy, even ill, if I’m away fom it for any length of time. At present I’m working on a sequel to my debut novel and finding it challenging.
It turns out Just days after being crowned Miss Ireland, Marie Hughes- representing Mayo – has been dethroned after it emerged she was too old to enter the beauty competition. Before you start thinking that she’s some washed up, wrinkly old geriatric we should probably tell you that the Mayo model is only 25. Yes, 25 years young and she’s still considered too old to represent Ireland in the beauty pageant.

2. Add cashews, 1 cup of the potato, and the cauliflower. Add enough water to almost cover the veggies (i.e. a few should be poking out). Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20 mins, until veggies are very soft.
It’s no secret that I prefer private institutions rather than public ones. One might ask why is that and the answer’s pretty simple; private firms are more efficient compared to their government counter parts. If you want to open a bank account just go to a bank of your choice, talk to one of the staff to discuss the terms and conditions and if everything goes right you’ll have an account ready by the time you walk out of that bank. And of top of that, you’ll have your transaction ironed out in a comfortable place and environment with usually pleasing people assisting you. And now, think of the times when you had to apply for documents in a government agency and compare it to private firms. Is it as smooth sailing as applying for a bank account or a bank loan? Did the persons that attended to your concern in a government agency were as nice as the attendants in a private bank or even in a fast food restaurant? So tell about the time when you had to renew your driver’s license, how long did it took and more importantly was the service really that good? I often ask myself: “Where does my tax money go?” when I’m dealing with government agencies, for their services, generally speaking, are really poor, especially if you compare it to private companies. And why is that?

Despite being recommended that you apply for training contracts during penultimate year of your LLB I think it is time that the university careers service took a realistic approach and also said that the recruitment process can take time, and that it is rare these days for someone to get their training contract while doing their LLB. Yes, larger firms recruit 2 years in advance, but having worked with trainees and vac scheme students at a large international law firm I can say – the majority were second degree or second career and all had work experience. So today the question is whether as a penultimate year LLB student you should be applying for training contracts? Or whether it is a waste of time?
I’ve noted on January 2nd that I called our life insurance agent to let him know that Rob had died. I remember going up to my safe and getting Rob’s will and reading through it to familiarize myself before calling the agent. The agent had known us both for many years and was absolutely shocked at what had happened with Rob. He said he’d get me a small emergency expenses sum and the rest of the policy would probably come within 2-3 weeks.

You could serve these shortcakes with any kind of berry, and I’ll bet sliced nectarines or peaches would also be outstanding. You’ll want about ½ cup fruit per serving. I like to keep it simple and toss the fruit only with sugar – a small amount, to taste – and whatever you do, be sure to let the sugared fruit sit for about 15 minutes before serving, so that it gets nice and juicy and some syrup pools at the bottom of the bowl. That’s the stuff. Serve with unsweetened, softly whipped cream.
“If Big Cinema takes a lead in resolving the matter, it will put pressure on the other national-level multiplex chains like PVR Cinems, Inox Leisure, Fun Cinema and Cinemax that have stood united in their negotiations with the Bollywood producers,” the source said.

One of the best things a writer can do to prepare themselves for writing is to read the work of others. Fred East is entirely correct. If you never take time to read others’ works, you would not have a feel for what is going on in your industry. To learn the mechanics and trending for contemporary works, you must do your research. With writing, you can never just wing it.

This experience was rather nerve racking and I wouldn't want to do it again. The challenge was getting everyone to look and smile at the same time without a photographer making sure that everything was fine. Needless to say, I had more bad pictures of the group then good ones. Now the proofs are off to a professional Photoshop guru and I am out of the equation. Here is my version of our family pictures.
Dr. Bob’s stated that he had attended three or four church services and meetings each week at the North Congregational Church in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. He said that when he resumed his religious studies, he had refreshed his memory of the Bible and had received excellent training as a youngster in that in church and through Christian Endeavor. His son told me his father had read the Bible completely through three times in his “refreshment” period. His daughter told me her father read the Bible every day. Dr. Bob told his son he had read for an hour every night, drunk or sober, for many years. Dr. Bob spoke of the immense amount of literature he read. Scads and scads of books were found in his home, under his bed, and in the homes of his kids after the books had allegedly have been thrown or given away. And we now know the broad scope of the Biblical, Christian devotional, and other Christian literature he read. You can know it just by looking at the many remnant books we have found mentioned by family and friends or found in possession of his children. There is no doubt that, from early AA’s beginnings, Dr. Bob set aside a quiet time three times each day for Bible study, prayer, and reflection. He read and circulated a large number of Christian books on the Bible, Jesus Christ, prayer, quiet time, the sermon on the mount, the Book of James, and 1Corinthians 13. We also have Dr. Bob’s own frequent statement as to the “absolutely essential” study by AAs of the Sermon, James, and Corinthians. Also, Bob’s statement that AAs started the day with James, Corinthians, or the Sermon. We also have examined with care Dr. Bob’s specific interest in The Runner’s Bible where James is much discussed, his interest in at least four well-known commentaries on the Sermon on the Mount, and his enthusiastic circulation of Henry Drummond’s The Greatest Thing in the World (an essay on 1 Corinthians 13).

I was met with cheers and applause!! We got home and got out the popcorn popper and oil and popcorn. The kids got their step stools. Zach helped pour the oil, Teagan helped measure the corn. We flipped on the machine and waited for the pop show to start. I filled bowls with popcorn- disappointed that I couldn't find our special popcorn bowls. Got out the popcorn seasonings- cheddar cheese and ranch. The kids wanted both seasonings on their popcorn so we went hog wild sprinkling them on. Then we sat around in the living room and watched Wonder Pets, happily munching on our whole grain dinner.
This is not a romance about petulant misunderstandings and froths of pink happiness. Set against the background of army life, the book reveals the stress of military life: the sacrifices, the separations, the horror of war but also the valor, the honor and the weight of responsibility. The men who go to war are not the instigators of that war but do their duty with courage and determination. The women who love and support them deserve admiration. This key aspect lifts the book way above the average romance. It has been beautifully and meticulously crafted in a way that the values and attributes of these two people will not be forgotten. If you love romance that is thoroughly realistic and carries a message, then this book is for you.

Why It Matters: “By mandating the elimination of a Christian group’s standard of ‘personal commitment to Jesus Christ,’ Vanderbilt requires students to abandon their religious integrity and undermines their religious freedoms,” says the Christian Legal Society. “Leadership is crucial to the direction of any organization. Eliminating the requirement of a commitment to Jesus Christ in leaders takes away the group’s ability to effectively fulfill its purpose and continue its ministry.”

I am reminded, rather, of the power of fairy tales as pointed out by Bruno Bettelheim in The Uses of Enchantment. So many times, a weak character triumphs over a powerful foe by using his wits, e.g., in "Hansel and Gretel," a story of truly ghastly peril. The lesson young readers should take away from these tales is that they can solve some pretty tough problems by using their heads. Also, that they'd better not get too full of themselves, because even the most clever tricksters tend to get their comeuppance. Better still, children might just observe that a trickster's talents can be used for good, carrying out such minor projects as stealing the sun for humankind.
This week has been somewhat of a relief and a preparation for me. I'm relieved to have learned that my professors seem very engaged and my classes don't seem like they'll give me too much trouble. I'm feeling more prepared to buckle down, get ready, and trudge through these classes full throttle. I'm will absolutely not allow them to defeat me!
I think the only issue I had with this was the insta-love. I think that was my fault though, because the pacing was *so* fast (which was great by the way), I couldn't keep up with the timing in the novel and still thought it had been a few days until how long it had really been was mentioned at the end! So really, it wasn't insta-love, it was just me not being able to keep up haha!

I won't hold up pretenses - I came to Shirley Collins music by way of tracing the influences of my influences when I was thinking of myself as a songwriter. It's a practice I've kept up even though I'm no longer actively writing / composing -- I believe it's called "research" by those music conservatory types of people. For me it meant listening to certain records very deeply and often, paying close attention to writing credits and liner notes. THIS was my (informal) music education, and I would trace genealogies of musicians and writers to arrive at mutual fonts of inspiration. This was in the days before music blogs and the instant-gratification of internet sharing communities (before long after listening to music on wax cylinders, lest any readers think that I am absolutely ancient). The days when you had to literally hunt down music by haunting used record and CD shops, making real-life-flesh-and-blood friends with similar interests, or even visiting a public library or two. For music from my own home continent, North America, that's meant going back to some of the earliest material available thanks to dedicated and largely independent labels interested in divulging it. For English music, my interests started with Fairport Convention and sprouted like a weed to Pentangle, Steeleye Span, Davy Graham, and eventually landing at the foot of the Great Mother of them all, Shirley Collins. And there it more or less stops. I could dig deeper some day, I suppose. (Incidentally I discovered the records of Nick Drake and The Incredible String Band along the course of this musical sojourn, rather than the river flowing in the other direction -- I just had to put that in there to show "I was there before it was HIP!" thanks to the neo-freak-folk phonies or whatever they are calling themselves, if they still exist at all).

Hopefully in the full sun of the Potager they will bloom into summer.

Tighter starts out at, what I'd like to consider, a casual pace. Griffin takes her time establishing the story and setting without allowing any of the scenes to drag or become boring. Everything learned was necessarily so and the foundation was deftly laid in a way that managed to be both entertaining and informative. As I'm dropped chilling, intriguing hints concerning what is going on at the mysterious Skylark, the plot gradually begins to quicken and become even more suspenseful, with my anticipation building and building, until the story reaches it's dramatic climax. A couple of aspects were slightly predictable but there were also plenty of twists to keep me satisfied. I also found myself falling in love with the actual setting of Little Bly, which is no surprise seeing as I'm a total sucker for New England ghost/horror stories.

The old Greek philosophers who assumed that some men are slaves by nature, will turn in their graves today if they see how the wheel has turned full circle, and how, owing to the flawed system of democracy and the Whiteman’s feelings of guilt, the slaves now rule southern Africa. It is no coincidence that the Chinese and the rulers of Black African States are still closely related in more respects than just plain commerce and trade, --- since the bonds between the two were likely forged by way of fearful domination way back in ancient times.

Crispness and a dryness are the hallmarks of the saison style, making it closer to a chardonnay than bock. It has a tartness characteristic of Belgian beers, but in a minor key; it's balanced by a mineral dry (partly, perhaps, from hard water) accentuated by Kent Goldings hops--lots of 'em. (The Belgians make classic regional beers, but they are far from parochial: borrowing a classic English hop to produce this classic Belgian ale is in keeping with Belgian virtuosity, and, I like to think, a tip of the hat to the kinds of beers like IPAs that may have helped inspire Dupont.) This is one of the hoppiest Beligian styles, and to my mind why it is tailor made for the Northwest palate. Finally, sometime after the initial, alcoholic first note and subsequent notes of tart and dry, but before the long, hoppy finish, the malts have their moment, offering a surprising amount of sweet fruit.

How can we fix the whole problem? The simple answer comes from the employers. Start your hiring. The economy has really picked up and the time has come to deliver more employee confidence. Let me give you an example of what not to do. Recently at my facility one of the senior management left for a job at a different firm. Normally this would cause a trickle down effect causing people to move up in their careers. However, my firm decided not to replace him. Instead they though it best to move his responsibilities down to his subordinates who would then move some of their responsibilities down etc. Now we all have more work to do at the same wage AND NO HOPE TO MOVE UP! This shows that they don’t want to encourage career growth instead want to encourage more stress on an already over stressed population.
And we're so happy that Megan has decided to attend Minnesota State University, Mankato, for a few years so that we can enjoy her dancing. She was amazing. Megan's jigs, slip jigs and hornpipes were so good they were distracting to a "certain harpist" who could see those dancing feet through the strings and almost lost track of where she was in the music!

Other important news White announced was that Frank Mir will be getting the go-ahead nod for facing JDS. Alistair Overeem was next in line for JDS but a random drug test delivered after the fight with Lesnar came back with high testosterone levels. Alistair is sticking with he withdrew from the fight due to time constraints the UFC had on marketing the event, which they couldn’t do until his hearing with the NSAC. Its was a good switch by Dana because at his hearing yesterday Overeem was denied his license to fight in Las Vegas and is unable to reapply for nine months. Thinking that this would put a damper on the UFC 146 all heavyweight card White made some major changes that would keep in tact. Cain, who was originally set to fight Mir is now facing Bigfoot Silva. Roy Nelson, who was fighting Bigfoot Silva is now fighting Gonzaga.
And that rose carved into that tombstone? It is a symbol for Catholics and Eastern Orthodox for the Virgin Mary and also for Christ. The fountain? It is the well-spring of the Water of Life, or of the Christ of St. John 7. The spaceship? It symbolizes the next step in Severian's life.

After you’ve picked out your materials, you’ll need to cut them into the appropriate size rectangle or square. The best thing about making them yourself is that you can choose a size that works for you – we have multiple sizes that we use in our own house. I’ve found that a 6″X7″ wipe tends to work best for us, but feel free to experiment to find what works for you.
So your little son starts to act a little girlish when he is four years old and instead of squashing that like a cockroach and saying, “Man up, son, get that dress off you and get outside and dig a ditch, because that is what boys do,” you get out the camera and you start taking pictures of Johnny acting like a female and then you upload it to YouTube and everybody laughs about it and the next thing you know, this dude, this kid is acting out childhood fantasies that should have been squashed. Can I make it any clearer? Dads, the second you see your son dropping the limp wrist, you walk over there and crack that wrist. Man up. Give him a good punch.
Down the hall, my two daughters are reading their chosen books. My second youngest is waiting for a turn at the read aloud, and she comes down the hall to check on me. “I’ll be down to read to you next,” I reassure.

I seriously can't get through the day without this thing, it is the BEST and I highly suggest purchasing one. Other than that I've grabbed a few notebooks and my favorite babysitting family in DC gave me folders and an adorable accordion file which has taken care of the rest of my supplies! The only thing I think I'm still missing is the proper bag for all of my supplies. I have plenty of potential options - vineyard vines, vera bladley, a backpack (which I will refuse to use). What I really want though is a big Longchamp bag. I have some of the other sizes but I'm just dying for the school book size.

In retrospect, how could I be anything but happy? Whatever else the nightmare taught me, one thing is clear: At the moment of a crisis, you and I usually “see through a glass darkly,” as Saint Paul put it (1 Corinthians 13:12). But know this: the day will come when you look back and see that what appeared as a puzzling jigsaw of unwanted pain and confusion has given way to the beautiful tapestry that is your life.

In review, I would have preferred having the black numbers behind the white or I could have inked the edges black. I sometimes make a mess inking small pieces so I left them alone. If I had some school scrapbook paper with a small pattern on it, I would have cut a mat for behind the numbers. My go-to store was out. Our colors are blue, black and white with a little silver. In hindsight, silver would have been a good choice, but I like it the way it is!

By now you should’ve broken down 4 or 5 goals for the next year. Maybe lose some weight; maybe go back to school or save some money. They should be SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-specific). But how do you get there? You break it up into manageable chucks, each chunk itself a mini-SMART Goal.

To most men, women remain a mystery. Being either sex poses its unique challenges and there are books with advice. Susanna Foth Aughtmon has written I Blame Eve: Freedom from Perfectionism, Control Issues, and the Tendency to Listen to Talking Snakes ($12.99, Revell, softcover), a humorous and encouraging book that explores “our deep need to be in control.” It blends Scripture (Revell is a Christian publishing house) with insight and the view that there is “a unique path laid out for each of us.” In contrast, Orna Gadish addresses the fact that 47% of young adults have never been married, 51% are living without a spouse, and choosing to be single is now a worldwide phenomenon. Don’t Say I Do! Why Women Should Stay Single ($14.95, New Horizon Press, softcover) officially due off the press in July. Our society has afforded women the freedom to hold jobs that give them a freedom that did not exist for earlier generations. The author focuses on the “inadequacies and dissatisfaction with traditional marriage” encouraging women to think for themselves and stay single. Clearly this is transforming the male-female relationship that has been the keystone for society and has significant implications for the future. I am old fashioned enough to think that marriage has worked well enough for generations and single women raising children have a raft of problems that need to be addressed. Some women, however, will find comfort in this book.
We are currently locked in a war over government spending. The Tea Party wants it stopped now at all costs and if anyone goes against their wishes, watch out retribution is coming. The only problem with the Tea Party’s approach is that those who share their view lack the power to impose the Tea Party’s demands. As has been pointed out repeatedly, Republicans only control one half of one branch of government – the U.S. House of Representatives. This hardly a position of strength in which an ultimatum can be issued. Strategy must be employed to gain the power necessary to impose one’s will. Until then, Washington’s culture cannot be permanently changed. One must accept one’s limitations and take what victories may come in order to obtain the ultimate goal – restore Washington to our country’s fundamental principles.

Someone please correct me if I am wrong but it is my understanding that the Sheriff’s Department is responsible for overseeing the County Jail. The transporters and such work for the Sheriff’s Department, as well. I used to do social work in a large jail and so I know, generally, how these things work. Bottom line is that the individuals smuggling contraband into the jail are either directly employed by the Sheriff’s Office or, at the very least, overseen by The Man.

But walk, as I did recently, from the start at the Calle de Alcalá to its end at the plaza España. Don’t just look at the ephemera of what the shop windows display, but look high and take in the timeless design of the facades of the buildings. See gods and angels fly from the rooftops, nymphs carved in stone around the window frames, and the exquisite proportions. Regard the immense scale of the buildings, the width of the road. Recall the history. Imagine sandbags lining doorways and bursting shells. See well-dressed ladies shopping and the clang of the trams passing by. And in that space try to picture the narrow, dank, depressing, dirty streets and alleys that Gran Via replaced. The street is a triumph, an architectural marvel.
I breathe in cold steam.

At the Battle of Dettingen in 1743, Sir Andrew Agnew of the Royal Scots Fusiliers developed a new tactic based on the courage of his men. Instead of standing to face a cavalry charge, as was the norm, they would create a gap to allow the enemy in. They would then close again to destroy the surrounded foe.

Religion is a mother of touchy subjects and it’s one I’ve never really cared to argue against or about because I find arguing about it somewhat pointless in general – grownups usually have their minds made up about it one way or another so either you’re (pun intended) preaching to the converted, or talking to an unholy wall. I’m curious as to what will happen when it (religion, god) will be brought up by a child, my child specificaly, who with his fresh mind will be seeking ways to form his own opinions. I’m sure it will come up sooner or later (we live in a Portugese neighbourhood and if that doesn’t tell you anything you should say a couple of Hail Marys for good measure). I will probably tell him that I was born into a Catholic faith and that I was baptized and that, yes, there was a point in my life when I obsessed over god being really mad at me because I said fuck you. I will tell him these things because he’ll need to know where I’m coming from when I tell him to question religion and even god. I want to influence him but I want him to have a mind of his own. I want to tell him that it’s bad to blindly buy into dogma but, at the same time, I don’t want him to feel like I’m prohibiting him from developing his beliefs. My only lesson would be to question everything because you should always, always be curious and work your mind in all the bendable ways possible. (Yes, even allow it to consider god if god happens to appear to it one day after bouts of atheism — just makes sure it’s never the god that makes you scared, unforgiving and closed-minded.)

Friday - The morning working, and the afternoon teaching art. After school, brought The Youngest home, while The Oldest had a DI meeting. Don't know what DI is? Go HERE. I packed myself and The Boys, and The Dude was already gone. After DI, I took The Boys to my Sister's house. She watched them while I had dinner with some friends I haven't seen in years. This is mostly due to The Dude's bridge burning, and my inability to fight for those friendships. They were all VERY supportive, and it wasn't as awkward as I feared. The one person who was invited and recently revealed an inappropriate relationship with The Dude, bowed out, and so it was a good dinner. There is still some interpersonal drama amongst that group, but I do not have the time nor inclination to get involved. Rode BART home and got to bed about 1:30 Saturday morning.
* The University of Michigan Consumer sentiment index is expected to dip to 66.0 from 67.5. That is well off the bottom, but we probably need to see it get much closer to 90 to indicate the economy is back to being healthy. I am not a big fan of this number, or the related Consumer Confidence number. With the Consumer representing over 70% of the economy, theoretically these numbers should be vital. The problem is that what consumers say in these surveys, and what they subsequently do, are often very different.
This is kind of taking the place of my rules for getting the awards and since it has been quite a while and those bloggers that gave me the awards probably think I have forgotten about them I really haven't!

I'll take more cuttings later in the year to add to these, and hopefully end up with a nice hedge. Being shrubby herbs, these have fairly long roots, which is good, but not good enough. The terrace is six foot tall at its highest, and those roots will never extend that far! I needed something else to reinforce the lower levels of the terrace. I had two ideas, and in a belt-and-braces approach, have implemented both.
One thing for certain, they absolutely don't make characters like Jimmy Durante anymore! In this scene he tries to chisel Candy (The Phantom Tollbooth) Candido as Molineri the Florist, out of 60 cents, by bidding $1.00 on this little disaster of a X-Mas tree, when he only has 40 cents, and tells him he'll pay him the rest later!

For the last recipe these were perfect pick by Dorie herself, reminding me how my love of baking grew in the first place. Thumbprint cookies always remind me of baking with my grandma.

You can get the full recipe from Dorie here and read a great little wrap of of what this group was all about. I haven't been here from the beginning but I loved the time that I did get to bake with everyone and I look forward to starting the new book in February.
It’s an obsession I have experienced first-hand. As an editor at Nature Publishing Group who helped to organize a conference series in China and who visited several laboratories, the burning question almost all senior academics wanted me to answer was what would it take to have a “homegrown Nobel Prize?” (My answer, rather weak I admit, was to say that while there might be the talent, you have to create and nurture a culture and environment similar to what you would find in so-called “Nobel-worthy” institutions.) My first experience of Nobel Week in December 2007 coincided with a visiting delegation from China, with the question foremost in their minds. Nobel committee members have come under fire for accepting paid-for trips to China, though a probe by the Swedish government anti-corruption body found no evidence of bribery, concluding that the prize selection process is too complex for any individual to have a significant influence.
Things progressed quite quickly, although this is mostly down to the weather being good for a change. The whole coop measures roughly 3 feet by 3 feet, the roof slopes backwards from 3 feet to about 2 and a half feet and it's about 5 feet high, I made it like this to allow some space underneath the coop, this gives the chickens some extra room and allows for air to flow around the coop.

She was still having depressing thoughts about her life (mostly, what is she going to do when she graduates college in May, and enters into the real world), and then the tears started. I half-listened to her drone on and on, thinking that I wasted my money on this incredibly nice room that I was sharing with Debby Downer, or Negative Nancy, if you prefer, and occasionally offering a two-word tidbit of advice. She was in the middle of some monologue, and I was staring off in to space in the direction of the bottom of the tub, when suddenly this “bath” got very interesting.

Juliette said, "I have, in my opinion, an excellent choice for Canada and that is having read Blind Assassin as well! My choice so far would be The Other Side of the Bridge by Mary Lawson. Gorgeously written by a native of Canada who now lives in South London Mary Lawson thouroughly researched her setting. A fine story of the joys and sorrows of life, relationships and shocking events. Set in the author’s native Canada this book centres on the invented town of Struan. I use the word centres deliberately. The characters are fixed on their ‘place’ and the narrative reflects time and again the impact of life and the characters’ perceptions of life beyond their town. It is not only the characters who reflect, it was myself reading and taking in their point of view that made me ponder how differently the second world war must have seemed to those living lives so very far away, in such different circumstances. Much of Mary Lawson’s prose is almost understated yet at the same time tremendously powerful. She intertwines a sense of place with her characters’ sense of belonging and a way of life that may or may not continue. When Pete and Ian sit eye to eye with a myriad of dragonflies on a ledge formed of rock three billion years old, their communing with nature is almost palpable.

However keep in mind that like the subject itself, often the movie can get a little dry. Like Eliezer, the audience needs to have an eye (and ear) for detail and a bit of patience. Still, this is a film that has a fresh viewpoint on a subject as old as mankind itself (and I’m not talking about the Talmud) and gives some insight into the relationship between fathers and sons that perhaps most fathers and sons – not to mention wives and daughters – could benefit from.

Some things I would suggest is playful teasing and flirty banter but not too much that she doesn’t realize you are interested in her. A woman will get the idea that you like her, but you haven’t given too much of yourself without receiving anything in return. You are also safe in that you haven’t completely let the cat out of the bag, but just enough to let her know you have somewhat of a sexual or intimate interest in her. When you take this approach and the woman is being pushed and pulled she in becoming anxious to see how you plan on moving it to the next level – so she continues to play along. Also, with playful/teasing flirty banter, the woman (if interested) will reciprocate in some way. So both parties are involved in the exchange and not solely one person doing all the pursuing. Things are very clear early on, in whether the BOTH of you are “feeling” each other.

I will never run a Rock N’ Roll Marathon ever again. I will stick to smaller events. These people do not care about the participants, but lining their pockets with money. The money for the entrance fee did not go to St. Jude, but you had to donate on top of the nearly $150 entrance fee so they could get money. What a joke! The competitor group should be ashamed of themselves. Also after the race, Steven needed ice for this knee. They iced him up no big deal, but I was really dehydrated. There were several cases of Gatorade so I asked if I could have a bottle. The lady would not give me one and she was very rude about it too. I told her I was pretty dehydrated so she gave me a pint of hot tap water. Gee thanks lady go kick rocks.
They don't celebrate Thanksgiving in Iraq but maybe they should start. And perhaps we could celebrate Thankstaking this year and ask the Iraqi people to show us some appreciation for liberating them from Saddam Hussein and leaving the majority of their population intact. And perhaps they could thank us for the three hours of electricity they have every day, and the 30% of their citizens who have clean water and the 20% with decent sanitation could thank us for that. And they might want to thank us for the billions of dollars we have pumped into that country, some of which has actually gotten to Iraqi citizens. Things are better now in Iraq than they have been at any time since we invaded. Shouldn't we get a little appreciation for that?

The word 'reading' is highly problematical. Yes, most of us will say of a child reading a page of print out loud that she is 'reading'. However, if we talk about 'reading' or try to come up with adequate definitions of reading, we will of course always include some sense of understanding what the signs on the page, screen or wherever signify in the culture that language is part of. Reading is about some kind of transfer of meaning, or interaction with meanings intended by authors and meanings made by readers. Meaning is at the heart of it. Why else would we bother?

She has so far penned delightful and informative children’s books on Athanasius, Augustine, John Calvin and John Owen (as part of the ‘Christian Biographies for Young Readers’ series published by Reformation Heritage Books and aimed at children from 7 to 10 years of age). In her latest book, a fictionalised biography titled Weight of a Flame (P&R Publishing, 2011) she introduces ‘young readers’ (read teenagers) to the inspiring ‘Italian Heretic’ Olympia Morata (1526–1555), locating Morata in her social and religious context – a volatile sixteenth-century Europe – and highlighting her passion for Scripture, for Calvin’s Institutes, for scholarship (she lectured on Cicero, wrote commentaries on Homer, and was one of the most sophisticated Latin stylists of her time), for poetry, and for faith. Those seeking Morata for grown-ups should read Morata’s work first hand (published as The Complete Writings of an Italian Heretic and edited by Holt N. Parker) and the relevant chapter in Roland Bainton’s Women of the Reformation: In Germany and Italy. (There are also published studies by Jules Bonnet, Amelia Gillespie Smyth, Ottilie Wildermuth, Caroline Bowles Southey, Robert Turnbull.) But for Carr’s target audience, this book is the only one I know of on Morata. It’s just a pity that the book’s cover (by which all books are judged) is so suggestive of an advertising brochure for some exclusive and now-outdated ‘college for young, strong and self-reliant ladies’.

By the time he returned to England permanently in 1785, he was wearing women’s clothes full time. According to witnesses, he made no attempt to adopt feminine mannerisms. He hiked up his dress to run up stairs and fenced with manly vigor. Yet, the question of his sex was widely debated in society at the time....

I passed on the tortilla bowl that their salads usually come in and I also passed on cheese and sour cream. I went with lettuce, black bean and corn salsa, grilled chicken, pico de gallo and the mango salsa. They added a little bit of their picante ranch dressing before I could refuse it, but according to the WW dining out guide, it’s only 1 pt+, so it wasn’t a big deal. In total, it was 7 pts+ for the whole salad and it was SOOOO good!! The mango salsa made it. I’m going to make some at home this weekend! I bet it would go great with tilapia. Mmm…

College football is indeed moving to a four-team playoff after the 2013 season. Other than that, not much new to report. Hopefully they’ll have most of the details hammered out by the end of June. BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock on the Dan Patrick Show today, said they were seriously debating on whether the semi-finals/first round would be played on campus or at neutral sites. I understand home games for the no. 1 and no. 2 seeds would be a way to reward them for regular season success, but I hope to see neutral site games rotating at the sites of current BCS bowl games (and still think they should replace the Fiesta with the Cotton).
I came across the Kindle published masses turning to Joe Konrath to explain an unexpected downturn in sales. Understandably, Konrath’s self-publishing and ebook success is seen as the line in the sand for so many authors.

I had a few scraps from cards I've been making for this weekend's stamp show so decided to use them for this card. I inked up the adorable Miyako again, she was the perfect size for my small card. I paper pieced her outfit with a small scrap of dp and used Copics to color her up. Had enough to paper piece the origami heart as well.
The Tobias brothers work with a number of traditional media, almost abandoned to the folklore of artistic practice; woodcuts, typography and ceramics. But although they have honoured the luxury of all these techniques there is nothing more certain at Maureen Paley than their contemporaneity. The colours they print with are almost like nothing I have ever seen before, but remind me of the photocopy foil, Omnicrom. A typewriter is hammered at obsessively to make a typographic portrait which recalls, but is distinctly more eloquent than, a piece of computing code. Totemic ceramic creatures are enshrined in gallery corners or hanging from the ceiling.
Yes, yes I am still working on an EMP-Solar flare special. This weekend I got distracted by David T. Zabecki's The German 1918 Offensives. Which is very interesting, but does not have a lot to do with either phenomena- Although I suppose the German flame out in 1918 does have certain metaphorical similarities.
Walking back to the start/finish area, I gave back in encouragement what a number of runners did for me. This began in November 2010 over the eight hours that I spent at the PAU 50K. It is so amazing regarding the camradarie of the ultrarunning community worldwide. I met up with Noe and Eduardo. Noe had finished his 50K and Eduardo came by and had a few hundred meters to go. Getting to see him finish the 50 miler and finishing second was a great feeling! Also, I had the opportunity to meet several more runners, particularly some members of the Quicksilver team and Jean Pommier whom shared ultrarunning experiences. Indeed, the camradarie is so strong!

So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

If you feel uncomfortable with the medium or psychic you go to in any way this is another reason to find someone else. It could just be personality clash or the fact the medium or psychic concerned is full of their own self-importance and feels superior to those they’re seeing as if they’re doing everyone a favour; believe me, there are plenty around like that. No mediums should talk in strange voices, talk of connecting with wondrous beings, put on dramatics of any kind or frighten you by their behaviour.
I am referring to germs, they found us and apparently are tough enough to stand up to the copious amounts of Lysol used in our house. Jack has been sick for the better part of a week, he has been struck with what we thought was strep throat and some sort of upper respiratory virus (para virus) that is lingering and according to our pediatrician has the reputation of causing secondary pneumonia. The poor kid has not been feeling well at all, but I sent him back to school on Wednesday after being on antibiotics for 36 hours, and no fever for 24 hours. He looked awful and had no appetite, but we worry about him getting too far behind. I know, I am a contender for “worst mother of the year” for sure. The kid is smart, really smart, but slow, really slow. Yesterday, he came home from school and it was just the two of us sitting at the kitchen table sharing a bowl of soup. He was so tired he could not hold his head up. He shared with me that he did not feel well, but he liked that it was just the two us at the table. We talked about some very intense stuff, he cried, I cried, and told him that I was happy that he talked with me. I am not sure if it was the fever or the emotions brewing inside, but he needed me and I was so glad that I could be there for him. His fever is better today, but his symptoms are not. I will bring him back to our pediatrician on Monday morning if he is not any better.
We could have happily sat for longer eyeing the Ploughmans, which looked to come with a months cheese intake. It wasn't to be as approaching we saw a gang of blokes approaching. I say blokes but they probably referred to each other as "chaps". A safe guess was that this was a stag do as one of their number was Mankini clad. For those who are uninitiated as to Mankini you want to think twice about googling it. Let's just say it's a piece of Lycra that leaves very little to the imagination. Initially the group caused some amusement as only a man half naked in fluroescent Lycra can, but told that they couldn't be inside unfortunately found the table next to us. If Butlins was Shoreditch on Sea this particular part of Minehead had become overrun with Claphamites. No need to Google this just think public school boys.

Patient with both friends and enemies,
Big Sister had her States Night at school. All the fourth graders had to present on the state they researched and decorate a parade float on a Radio Flyer wagon. Despite saying she was nervous, she did a great job! However, we are happy to have this done with. Some of the floats were amazing, but I am happy to report that Big Sister did hers by herself and her parents did not do the whole project for her. I am fine with helping, but the teacher in me knows that this project is not meant for the parents to do entirely.
I am not always aware of what it is I need to know to advance my novel until someone presents it to me: What about that character? Why did you structure it that way? Why don’t you try this way? Do you really need to say that?

Look up manners in Wikipedia, this is what you'll read: In sociology, manners are the unenforced standards of conduct which demonstrate that a person is proper, polite, and refined. They are like laws in that they codify or set a standard for human behavior, but they are unlike laws in that there is no formal system for punishing transgressions, other than social disapproval. They are a kind of norm.
Aggra continuously pushes Thrall to discard his chosen name and take up the moniker of Go’el.

The folks over at Synapse Films/Impulse Pictures are celebrating Nikkatsu Studios' 100th anniversary by releasing what they are calling The Nikkatsu Erotic Films Collection. They were nice enough to send me the first two volumes, Debauchery (1983) and True Story of a Woman in Jail: Sex Hell (1975). As some of my readers may know, Nikkatsu, Japan's oldest movie studio, made a business decision in 1971 to all but abandon traditional filmmaking for what they speculated would be a much more lucrative proposition: softcore pornography. They called it Romantic Pornography (Roman Porno for short), and, as planned, it was a big hit, despite a total lack of visible genitalia or even pubic hair. This is down to Japanese filmmakers' endless creativity when it came to depicting sexual activity -- it's amazing how hot a sex scene can be without ever seeing anyone's privates! Plus an effort was made to class things up with compelling storylines, decent acting and high production values.
If making muffins:
You need to construct the sides out of wood or other suitable material to contain your heap (I’ve used some old pallets), the best size is 1.5 metre by 1.5 metre. It is important that oxygen is present but you only need a relatively small amount as the material going into the heap is bulky and will trap air. So drill some small holes into the sides (I’ve put thin board over the gaps in the pallet and left a handful of holes for some air to get in). Remember this must be on a solid base, I’ve used half a dozen small paving slabs and I plan to build another bin alongside soon.

Happy Birthday my beautiful girl xx
A Touch of Love...
Dad taught me valuable skills; how to work with tools, caring for and sharpening blades, small engine maintenance and repair. To this day I can sharpen any blade - axes, lawnmower blades, machetes; all my military knives are razor sharp. Dad taught me drawing; how human and animal figures can be developed from cubes, cylinders and cones; perspective, texture, shadow and form. What my Dad taught in maths and technical drawing - together with my own humble credentials as a military engineer - has led directly to my present career in industrial security.
So...Greta is back on track and on her way. It would be really nice to eventually get to my maintenance portion of this journey....like......soon......! It is time. There is no (valid) excuse for me to not get my body to where it needs to be and then keep it there. I have the skills. I just need to stick with it and focus.

"Daddy and I were watching TV and there was this scene. A dad and his kids were at a diner, and they were with the dad's girlfriend. The kids, a boy and a girl, started fighting and there were these two gigantic strawberry milkshakes on the table. One of the milkshakes got knocked over and the dad got really angry, shot up from the table in a huff, but the girlfriend, she was so calm, grabbed some napkins and said, "Don't be upset. It's just a milkshake," and the dad was so surprised at her response, he looked at her like she was from a different planet. It was like he was thinking, really? I don't need to lose my temper? And he sat back down and no one yelled and no one got upset and they just cleaned it up and the dad sat there, stunned by this whole new universe that opened up before him."

evening moves on toward morning and I have come full circle.
Sometimes in pride i begin to think of my sin as “lesser” than another’s sin and i forget that when i was born into this world i was born separated from God, powerless, ungodly, a sinner, his enemy, under his wrath, dead in sins, only evil all the time, doing no good at all. (Romans 5:6,8,10; Ephesians 2:1,3,5; Genesis 6:5; Romans 3:10-12) I fail to remember that when i break any part of the law i have broken the entire thing. (James 2:8-11) Therefore i am a law-breaker in the eyes of God. He doesn’t measure my sin the way we do culturally. He asks if i have sinned… certainly i have… and therefore i am separated from God!
I am a very big believer in two things; dystopian literature, because when I am in a bad mood I can simply pick one up and wait for people to die via slow and horrible methods. Though I find this very refreshing in all moods, it has more appeal when I am pissed off at the world. And before the thought of is she insane even forms inside your head the answer is only slightly! And the second enthuastic thing that I feel the need to point out in this review is that I am a feminist. Honestly, people. And therein lies the appeal of this book.
You want to loose weight? DO it. Talking about it doesn’t make it happen, getting up earlier to go to to the gym, using your lunch break to go for a 30minute walk, cutting out the evening snacks, is the only way to make it happen.

Perhaps, there are too many people who cling to a faulty and unsafe philosophy to point fingers to any one set of people. Could it be that there are so many problems involved in the system that there is no good solution? This is why we at The Special Gathering, a ministry within the mentally challenged community, must advocate for the community we serve. Richard Stimson, the Executive Director of Special Gathering, has said, “A shepherd protects his sheep. Therefore, advocacy must be a part of pastoral care.”
But there are things I could be doing that I'm not. I'm not on Goodreads, for example, and I'm not on Facebook (yes, I know it's hard to believe there are still people my age not on Facebook. I'll get back to that in a moment). The reason for this is simple: at the moment, I have nothing to sell, and thus nothing to promote. I don't believe the conversion rate from people seeing me on Goodreads now to sales is going to be worth time I could be spending actually getting the book ready.

The sale pens next to the livestock barn had stairs to an overpass so that you could walk up and check out the wares. A cowboy's jewel case. We wandered up after breakfast, and watched a few cows being herded out of barns and into trucks. They didn't care for us that much. They raced toward us, and came to a screeching halt when they realized we were standing overhead, and refused to go under the "bridge" we were standing on, until a—what—a cowpoke? A cowpoke sauntered up behind them and hit a plastic thingy on the ground to get them going. "Get along, little doggies." (He didn't say that; wouldn't it have been cool if he'd said that?

The original penitentiary at Sing Sing* was built in 1825 as part of a prison reform movement. Rather than locking up prisoners in a dungeon and treating them literally like animals, they were kept in single rooms and made to perform productive work together in silence. Eastern State in Philadelphia was part of a separate movement to have the prisoners sit in solitary and contemplate their sins – to be penitent. Guess which system won?
It’s a similar story with The Jam, where the deluxe editions of All Mod Cons and Sound Affects recently complemented the remastered CDs, which replaced the original CDs, which replaced the vinyl (which of course I still cling on to). The same goes for Paul Weller’s early solo output, and The Wedding Present, where the collection runs to 20 bits of vinyl plus numerous CDs, even more if you add David Gedge’s Cinerama off-shoot.

My father seems pretty atheistic, but I don't think cares enough about religion either way to even bother labeling himself. My mother is a rather spiritual person, with her own personal beliefs and a definite attitude of live and let live. My sister once referred to herself as a "superstitious agnostic", which I loved, but she doesn't feel the label of agnostic fits any more, and hasn't replaced it with any other labels. And me? Well, I usually simply refer to myself as an animist, and I also throw a little goddess/earth worship into the mix.

Tack on the stupidly small 4GB hard drive, add a contract that penalizes you if you hate Xbox Live, don’t have broadband or do and want to back out of the “deal” you made (not using Live? you STILL have to pay out a mandatory $360 – ha ha – before you can be set free) and well, that $99 could turn into the worst purchase for budget-minded gamers. It’s actually BETTER to spend money on the more sensible 320GB console/Kinect bundle, sign up to Live IF you want to (or if you CAN, as not EVERY gamer has broadband access) and buy games you like to play when you want.

This short biography of E.M. Forster, part of Hesperus Press' "Brief Lives" series, is an excellent one. It is not, nor is it intended to be, an authoritative work on Forster's life and work. It is, however, a good introduction. In a strictly chronological way, Canning hits the high points, and in so doing, he provides insight into Forster's life, his relationships, public and private.

In the glossy catalogue accompanying a 2001 British Museum exhibition about Cleopatra, scholar Guy Weill Goudchaux suggests that Cleopatra was probably slender. Why? Because she had to be light enough for one man to carry her rolled up in a sleeping mat along corridors of the palace and into Caesar's presence. But she probably wasn't too petite or she wouldn't have been able give birth to four children with no problems.

"While Vanessa had her first chemo treatments, we sat next to her in the visitor chairs and talked through our business plan. We took trips to try on wigs together and then followed that up with visits to paper shops. We’d google 'Adriamycin side effects' and then google 'small business web hosting'. It became a joint project, this cancer and this business. Together they formed a strange partnership of slowing things down and speeding things up, all at once.
Fr. Martin said he supposed that the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Vatican were not happy with the support the sisters broadly speaking gave to Obama’s health care reform which included provisions favouring abortion and contraception. According to the Holy See, the LCWR are feminist, non-compliant with the Church’s teachings and the bishops’ authority, gay friendly and too liberal. Upon completion of the “doctrinal assessment” which began in 2008, the Holy See decided that for five years, the Archbishop of Seattle, Peter Sartain, would act as a delegate, to monitor the actions of the LCWR, the association counting more than 1.500 members, who represent 80% of the 57.000 women religious in the U.S. This is because of the “unacceptable” positions taken by the association on issues such as the priestly ordination of women and the pastoral approach to homosexuality; not to mention the “a prevalence of certain radical feminist themes incompatible with the Catholic faith.”

Shampoo and condition your hair. If you are transitioning by wearing your loose, relaxed hair (no wig, sew-ins or braids), cleanse your hair using a sulfate-free shampoo at least once every one to two weeks. Follow each shampoo with a quality moisturising conditioner. Finger and /or comb hair while the conditioner is in. Rinse out. If your hair is braided or weaved, cleanse your hair every four to six weeks, followed by a deep conditioner after removing your extensions.
John Hope Bryant you did an awesome job with this piece. We need our children to aspire to be entrepreneurs as much as (or more than) they aspire to be athletes and entertainers.

I've since learned that this is normally how true disagreements play out between writers and editors. Sometimes you go backwards and forwards about things, and sometimes the author changes their mind and sometimes the editor does, but you can nearly always work it out. As a writer, if you've demonstrated the willingness to work hard to produce the best possible work, and if you've got the courage to argue your case both intelligently and with passion, you will get a lot of respect from your editor when it comes to the changes you're willing to make.

As a man, most people usually assume that men who wear pink shirts are either gay, fashionable, or wearing a formerly white shirt that’s been washed with the wrong color. But for me, I simply just like pink. Red is too strong, and pink is pleasant. Makes people around you think of you differently.
I imagine that I'm not the first attached parent who has focused so much attention on caring for her children, that taking time for herself and her spouse has fallen to the bottom of the priority list. I imagine that most people struggle to find family balance... to try to meet everyone's needs, including his or her own. I always had good intentions of going on dates or going to the spa (I can't tell you how many unused Groupons I have for restaurants, massages, and facials!) but somehow those things never ended up happening.
Appearance is an arranged and simplified world, at which our practical instincts have been at work; it is perfectly true for us; that is to say, we live, we are able to live in it: proof of its truth for us--

Due to a series of important changes in my life I have recently decided to work on developing some other skills that will help me complement my professional profile. The learning of these skills, implies me making changes. Changes that, are greatly influenced by several aspects of my personal side such as balance between body and mind, need for attention, incisive behaviour, empathy, leadership etc. I am in the process of acquiring healthy habits, I work out almost every day, work in the mornings, and study at night. I want to have better leadership skills, be more disciplined etc.

… He thinks the SEC should choose its division champions in football based on division record instead of overall conference record. “Your division champ should be decided on division games. Last year, it wasn’t fair for Tennessee and Florida,” Spurrier said. “They both played LSU and Alabama. Us and Georgia didn’t. So, us or Georgia almost had to win the division simply because of the schedule.”

So train your body, like a toddler, to listen to your mind when it says 'no' the first time. Stick to your guns. Soon, your body will begin to function on the same level as your mind. You think to yourself, "I already had a piece of cake, and I want another one, but I'm not going to have one." Decision made. End of story.

Cook fettuccine in salted boiling water until al denté. Drain, toss with a little oil to prevent sticking, and set aside. Melt butter over medium heat and sauté garlic 1 minute in a large sauté pan. Add cream and stir constantly over medium heat until mixture starts to bubble. Add Parmesan and stir until smooth and creamy. Turn off heat; add pasta to sauce and toss to coat. Serve immediately with fresh ground pepper and more Parmesan. Additional ingredients, such as sautéed shrimp or crabmeat, are an excellent addition.

As I've written in the past, Daniel and Dianah McQueen Hoover were my 4th g-grandparents. They were married in Gallatin County, Kentucky in 1826. After thirteen years in Indiana, they moved their family to Estill County, Kentucky. They lived in a remote area of the county in a hollow on Barnes Mountain. The family cemetery is located just up the hill from that hollow. The family that now lives on the land not only cares for that cemetery, but also has rebuilt a cabin on its original site using logs that Daniel had cut over 170 years ago. This cabin is perhaps 30 feet from the spring that Dianah drew water from.
This is a 3 page printable detailing my weekly and monthly chores for my Household Notebook. I use this a general checklist to make sure I get everything done in each room.

What the fuck? Whatever happened to fucked up twist endings? Whatever happened with people hurting or having something happen that you can believe? Case in point, the movie Once. I love that movie and recommend it to anyone that wants a movie that feels real, because to me it did and I think the fact that the actors really fell in love helps with the feeling that much more. The fact that these people are going through complicated feelings really shines in Once and yet the ending is believable and you don't feel as if you were force fed some saccharine ending so everyone can sleep lushly at night. You're offered something that makes you go, shit... it doesn't always end up perfectly. It didn't end in trauma mind you, it just offered something that REALLY could have happened and I appreciate that movie so much and for so many reasons and one of them is the ending. Oh, and might I add that nothing felt rushed in Once. Nothing, not one single frame and then you think back to your favorite movies or the best movies you've seen. Shit, you see Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa, and it didn't feel rushed. You see The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, Doctor Strangelove, Goonies, The Godfather, the First Matrix Movie, Fight Club, and NONE of those movies feel rushed ever unless it was the intention. But lately I've seen a bunch of movies that those last 15-20 minutes feel as rushed as ever and the end product suffers.
What happened here is pretty obvious. The generals would like to avoid open conflict with the Islamists, but they have no intention of giving up their prerogatives and their tax free financial empire. So they cut a deal with Amr Moussa. Dumping Suleiman was just a sacrifice to give this an appearance of fairness and legality.

She then broke the news of her summer plans to stay in the US for a month with her mother who lived there, having remarried.

And if she ever reads this, which is beyond doubtful, I would say this... thank you.

I had projected LSU CB Morris Claiborne to go to the Buccaneers with the fifth pick. He is considered the best cover corner in the draft, and has excellent size and speed. Well, the Bucs traded back, and the Rams lost out on the WR they wanted, so they traded the pick to the Cowboys who drafted Claiborne at six.

This week, plenty of bloggers are embracing the warmer temps with midi and maxi skirts, easy cotton dresses, and all in bold summer colors, natch. They’re looks that even my 7 year old self would’ve approved of!

The sector commander ordered a unit to round up Sangor’s neighbors for questioning, along with his fellow captives. The former captives confirmed that Sangor had spent a lot of time with one of the Rats and had not seemed to share their enthusiasm when the men had talked about escaping. Several of the men said the Rats were quick and devious, and smarter than most of us all put together. The Rats seemed pretty sure of themselves. They said the Rats were able to control the weather, that they were deadly accurate with lightning bolts. They said the Rats had some pretty advanced technologies, like that glass wall at the entrance to the cave they were kept in. The men had not seen any Rat soldiers or war materiel, except for that head Rat. It had been impossible to get any idea of what kind of forces our people were up against.
As a subject in the school curriculum, history was initially neglected during the transition to majority rule. The establishment of the “South African History Project” changed that. The Project’s aim, according to Sasha Polakow-Suransky of the Chronicle of Higher Education, has been “a resurrection of the subject as a prominent field of study in the national school curriculum.” Unfortunately, following the American academy’s example, the trend has been away from “the pursuit of objective historical truth,” toward a postmodern, politically correct reconstruction of historical events, with the aim of fostering “certain values,” in the words of Kader Asmal, the minister of education in 2000.
