YOU MAKE LOVING FUN

Aw come on! This is my platform! Free Tibet in every box of Cheerios! Bathe the whales! Nuke the fridge!...
But it’s not. Most school chicken nuggets have at least a zillion ingredients. Okay, I exaggerate. Maybe they have thirty-five. Modified corn starch, soy, beef extract and maltodextrin – among other things – are not something I’d want any human to have in moderation. The same goes for cupcakes. I’m not against cake, and I’m not against most traditions. Just the last two weekends I let my son sing happy birthday and consume cake. But it was my choice. I was there to be his “judgment,” and he ate confections. But I also know he’s not likely to eat cake for another whole year. The birthdays for the February 2010 babies from my mommy groups are all done, and so is the cake. I don’t have to worry about every neighborhood parent running down to the local grocery and bringing a sugar, corn syrup and white flour treat right to his preschool desk.
Inside of the card, I stamped Happy Birthday.
Rio Baker Cargo Airlines (Antofagasta) is the cargo division of Rio Baker. Rio Baker is an FBO and air taxi company based at Cerro Moreno Airport in Antofagasta. Until the arrival of this CRJ200 freighter, Rio Baker only had a Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain and a Lance as a fleet.

In 1982, Björk fell in with Stifgrim, a freeform rock-jazz (as oposed to jazz- rock) duo, comprimising guitarist Steinn Skaptason and vocalist/stand-up comedian Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson. Her sole gig with the band was a part of Iceland's bid to get into the 'Guinness Book Of Records' for the longest ever continuous live performance. Nearly one hundred bands took part in the event, which lasted several weeks, each playing for anything up to twelve hours. Björk's effort was recorded for posterity, and a choice 90-minute 'Best Of' recording of Stifgrim's world-record bid apparently survives on cassette. A week after this occasion, Björk was involved in one other Stifgrim-related event, where she accompanied Kristinn Jon Gudmundsson on guitar as he crooned his way through "Love Me Tender".
Tophatter has had a few glitches with their software...the missed alert for my customer being one of them. The other one was their server crashed on Saturday night in the middle of the weekend bazaar auction mostly due to the number of auction attendees in the room, I think. It took them about 20 minutes to reset everything and they were back in business. The staff have been very attentive to their customers...buyers and sellers alike.
Overheard by reporters standing outside a closed door campaign fundraiser in toney Palm Beach where the parking lot was valet-filled with Porsches, Mercedes, Hummers and a Maserati, Mitt threw out the following tidbits:
“Well, then, would you like a beer?” Howard stepped over to the side of his truck and reached in to open a cooler.

"I'm for Mitt Romney," the former president said Tuesday as the doors of his elevator shut, perhaps his only statement of public opinion on the race before the Nov. 6 election.

Step 2 – Drop and Bake: Drop batter by tablespoon onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in a well pre-heated 350º F. oven for 12 to 15 minutes. Do not over-bake. Cookies should be a bit gooey in the center. While warm, they will be very soft on the outside, as well. Allow them to cool on the pan a few minutes and then transfer carefully to a rack to finish cooling. (They will always be somewhat soft because these are gooey fudge brownie cookies, not hard or crunchy cookies.)
After making use of a convenient tree-stump chair (carved in situ by a friendly forester), I continue northwards towards Riding Bottom. On the left, more clear-felled pines, very recent judging by the greenness of the snedded branches and freshness of the chips spewed out by the chainsaw. On the right, by contrast, another low stone wall, topped with smoothly serpentine roots and limbs of beech, the boundary of Riding Copse beyond.
My first card
I used the Level 2 hostess set Fast & Fabulous combined with the Nursery Suite DSP and coordinating Quick Accents. I watercoloured the flowers and added some basics pearls to some of the centres. The ribbon is Certainly Celery grosgrain with an added white button. The greeting (from Fresh Cuts) was stamped on one of the border stickers from the Quick Accents pack and I punched the ends with a square punch to make a banner shape.

I climbed back into bed, snuggled under the warm covers and tried to get back to sleep, but I am too light a sleeper to turn off high-pitched sounds. Without his hearing aids in, David was oblivious to the chirps. I was a bit jealous that he could continue to sleep, while I hovered between a feeling of exhaustion, which cried out for just one more hours’ sleep, and irritation at that infernal metronomic chirping.
As the nightly program wound through several non-college football segments, Dunlaw reflected on the surreal nature of his situation: “I still can’t believe Herbie’s sleeping with my Tracy. It’s so unreal. I feel like I should be texting Knox right now. Y’know, something like, ‘Oh my god. You won’t believe this! This is amazing!’”

The love we made that brought our bodies one to one
We have plenty of fruit and vegetables.
We can tend to use spirituality like medicine or a hospital. We utilize it only when things aren't going right or when we're suffering financially, emotionally or relationally. Our pain and suffering, however, can be a path to transcending this selfish conception of spirituality into something more. It can make us ask the questions we normally wouldn't ask, and can lead us to bigger and broader questions, such "what's really the purpose of life?" and "how can we avoid suffering?"
I also feel a change coming in me. I prefer to stay at home, or go for a quiet dinner, or watch a movie. I don’t like clubbing anymore, or going and getting “wasted” which is what most of my friends do. Nothing wrong with that at all. But I am just not there anymore. My idea of a good night out now is relaxing at home with a good movie, or going to a cinema, or cooking dinner, or going out to eat. If alcohol must be involved, a nice quiet bar where we can sit and talk.
Alan was born in the Auvergnat town of Riom. His father Georges (Jord in Breton) Cochevelou was a civil servant in the French Ministry of Finance who achieved his dream of recreating a Celtic or Breton harp in the small town of Gourin, Brittany. In 1953, Alan began playing the instrument at the age of nine under the tutelage of his father and Denise Megevand, a concert harpist. Alan also learned Celtic mythology, art and history as well as the Breton language, traditional Breton dance and the Scottish bagpipe and the bombarde, a traditional Breton instrument, from the oboe family. Alan began playing concerts at eleven years and studying traditional Breton, English, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh folk music, also learning the drum, Irish flute, and tin whistle. He competed in and won several Breton traditional music competitions in the Bleimor Pipe band. Alan spent his childhood in Paris, with its cosmopolitan influences from France, Algeria, Morocco and elsewhere. But he fell in love with Breton music and Celtic culture in general, and often went back in his teens to Brittany.

Wade comes out and looks ready. Justin Robbins comes out to some club music, and the crowd is getting pretty rowdy. Choate has a bit of a size advantage over Robbins, but it sounds like Justin has the crowd on his side.
The next morning we made the short trip from Bela Vista, the small village on the Paraguayan border where we had stayed the previous night, to Fazenda Marilandia. This ranch is owned by Renata Stephen’s (our tour guide) aunt, Maria Loureiro Pinheiro, and is managed by her son, (Renata’s first cousin) Sergio Loureiro Pinheiro. The head cowboy, Roberto, was also available to show us around. He has been employed by Fazenda Marilandia for 35 years.
...His album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually he stopped releasing albums altogether. In 1993 he and four members of the Afrika '70 organization were arrested for murder. The battle against military corruption in Nigeria was taking its toll, especially during the rise of dictator Sani Abacha. Rumors were also spreading that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment. On 3 August 1997, Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent AIDS activist and former Minister of Health, stunned the nation by announcing his younger brother's death a day earlier from Kaposi's sarcoma which was brought on by AIDS. More than a million people attended Fela's funeral at the site of the old Shrine compound. A new Africa Shrine has opened since Fela's death in a different section of Lagos under the supervision of his son Femi Kuti...
There was that time I watched my father in a televised drama where he was portraying yet another down and out character. There was a part where he was cold and shivering and sad, and I am told I came out from under the dining table that was my favourite hiding spot and offered my blankie to the television set saying "Here daddy, you can have my blankie, you don't have to be cold!" The adults thought that was the sweetest, funniest thing ever, but to my four year old mind, my father was suffering and I wanted to help. I knew he was pretending, but could I be really, really sure he wasn't actually cold?

WEALTHY FAMILIES: The first is wealthy families where the older generation has retired or is nearing retirement. Typically, their income is secure and they’re concerned primarily with wealth protection and transfer. Agents may find that these wealthy families can take underutilized or under-performing assets and convert them to a permanent life insurance policy, often with the added advantage of a LTC rider. This strategy helps secure their wealth and makes it possible to pass on their assets to heirs in a tax-advantaged way, as well as assuring their long-term security if they need care.

So, adoptive families must be more exact with their questions, since many of them probably would argue that baby-buying is corruption. Instead of asking, "Do you feel there is wide-spread corruption in China's program?" a better question might be "Do you feel that paying substantial amounts of money for children is adoption corruption? And how wide-spread do you feel this baby-buying is?" It may be that he hedges, like the villager in the opening story, out of a reluctance to air China's dirty laundry, for there is one characteristic of the Chinese that I understand very well, having lived with one for seven years: The Chinese do not like to reveal the dirty secrets of their country, even to friends. It is a tradition and understanding that goes back hundreds of years. We might view it as lying, but the Chinese consider it "saving face."
Billy slowly drove into Casey’s driveway, and although she had been through a night of fear and terror, she felt nothing other than happiness and joy when she saw her house. It looked like heaven to Casey because she wasn’t even sure if she would live to see daylight. Casey slung open the truck door and jumped out of Billy’s truck in lightening speed. As she ran up to the driver’s side and softly said “I know exactly what happened last night, Billy. You guys drugged me and raped me. And I will never forget it. You’re going to get away with it because I am too ashamed to tell anyone what you guys did to me. You can bet your ass that God will avenge my honor. You may not go to jail, but you will suffer for what you did to me.” Billy looked at her, and he was completely stunned that she remembered what had happened. This is probably due to, the fact that they gave her what they thought was a drug that would make her forget. Evidently, the effects weren’t as potent as Billy had hoped.
Sorry, goat.
Prepare yourself for this awesomeness...
Anyway, we soon found out that if you never spoke, the zombie outbreak didn’t happen to most people. Much like the movie Pontypool, where the virus had attached to language itself. So a lot of us were walking from room to room, but really keeping conversation at a minimum, or not at all. Things were looking up near the end, but the whole dream was still kind of disturbing.
I've mentioned many reasons for having "photowednesdays" on this blog. some reasons are current events love of Brooklyn and keeping my idle hands from being the devils playthings. I've probably also mentioned it's not always easy to find a new pic of something Brooklyn-centric or born that's interesting. I never want photo Wednesdays to turn into a catalogue of cliched pics of the bridge or the arch.
I started with Indus, an IPA. It looked to be pouring a bit flat and it took a bit of coaxing to get a loose-bubbled head to form on the top. It didn't last long. However the beer really benefits from the low carbonation as it creates a wonderful cask-like effect, with just enough sparkle to push the flavours out. Naturally enough, it's hops out front: good honest English varieties by the taste of them, with lots of floral orange blossom laid on quite intensely, creating almost a resinous burn while staying clean and crisp, avoding all harshness. At 4.6% ABV it's around a percentage point weaker than the likes of White Shield and Bengal Lancer, but I'd regard it as being very much in the same league. The balance of marmalade and toffee you get in the others isn't present here, but the hop punchiness makes up for it for me. Tangy, sinkable and with a lasting bitterness, I really enjoyed it.
But even getting out officially isn’t easy. I believe that the US and its allies don’t really give a tinker’s curse about Afghanistan; as far as they are concerned, if the Afghans are intent on living in a barbaric medieval theocracy, where women are treated as chattels, those who don’t share the faith of the rulers live in fear of death, and there’re more or less continual low-level wars between various tribes, then they’re welcome to do so. Admittedly, there is the poppy problem – Afghanistan is the world’s largest producer of non-pharmaceutical grade opiates (92% in 2007) and also, incidentally, the world’s largest producer of hashish – but, despite all the hype about the so-called War on Drugs, I have a feeling that (for all sorts of reasons, many sordid, which I won’t go into here) the US and most other countries can live with that. No, the real problems are the two 500 pound
Another one that has crept up in the last 2-3 years is where I can be, physically and literally exist and take up Jaime-shaped space, based on the weather. If it’s a day I’m working from home and it’s sunny, I cannot be in my house. I pace around hugging the cat and feeling “off” and unproductive even if I’m getting work done.
Yes, I said spaces. This girl really has it going on, we get to see oodles and oodles of incredible inspiration in one post! It's like Christmas came early this year! Because there was SO much incredible inspiration and ideas, I condensed it some, but I am linking to her posts which contain additional details on her projects, and you will be sucked in. Just sayin'...
Our personal psychology is how our karmic patterns show up in this lifetime. A general Buddhist or Hindu perspective on karma suggests that the individual soul moves through consciousness lifetime after lifetime, incarnating again and again in the school of life in order to complete various tasks and lessons, and to release contractions of consciousness.
P.S. Not to beg, but know of any specific job opportunities in NYC, or have any ideas? I'm looking, since I may need something standard until I can launch my dreams...Any assistance, advice would be greatly appreciated.

I'm sure they'll get easier, but this year is going to be hard. I know this.
The ideas employed in foul play are given a false foundation but one that is seemingly real. They depend on the person to whom they present the ideas to mistake the reality. Thus the targeted person believes their somatic reactivity is evidence that the idea is real. And this is generally true. If we sense danger for instance, even though we don’t have sensory information our body will move to fear because that is natural. It is the preparation of our body to face and deal with the danger. In foul play the danger card is play to cause the targeted person to mistakenly believe that the presented idea, of which they are more conscious, has led to their somatic arousal. This empowers the ideas. In reality the danger posed and the idea presented are unrelated. It is through trickery that the person targeted is brought along to believing in the ideas presented. And you will see that with certainty when you are no longer unsuspecting of the foul play having done the experiments and having seen how easily you can be manipulated while believing the medical misinformation. And that includes the psychiatric babble about misreading others if you are suspicious. What they are effectively saying is that you have to accept appearances at face value. That’s self-serving garbage. When you have done the experiments and “wised up” or “level up” to use PC game parlance, then the foul game can’t be played as to obtain a result. You can “walk through the valley of the shadow of death and fear no evil”! A knowledgeable person can stand against the evil mobs and win. I am living proof of that but you need to see that for yourselves. It is good for you to be sceptical of what I am presenting but please also be curious. This is not about some academic pursuit; this is a life and death matter. To be empowered and reap the benefits for yourselves you must realize the truth and not just know it.

Scientists at Rothamsted are trialling a variety of GM wheat that produces a pheromone that aphids don’t like. Aphids eat wheat, and reduce crop yields. If you can stop them from going near the wheat, then the yields should be higher. As a pre-emptive strike, I’m going to point out that the gene added to the wheat occurs naturally in many species of plant. It is not, as has been said, a ‘cow gene’.

Under both systems, sacrifice is invoked as a magic, omnipotent solution in any crisis—and “the public good” is the altar on which victims are immolated. But there are stylistic differences of emphasis. The socialist-communist axis keeps promising to achieve abundance, material comfort and security for its victims, in some indeterminate future. The fascist-Nazi axis scorns material comfort and security, and keeps extolling some undefined sort of spiritual duty, service and conquest. The socialist-communist axis offers its victims an alleged social ideal. The fascist-Nazi axis offers nothing but loose talk about some unspecified form of racial or national “greatness.” The socialist-communist axis proclaims some grandiose economic plan, which keeps receding year by year. The fascist-Nazi axis merely extols leadership—leadership without purpose, program or direction—and power for power’s sake.
Of the 868 persons rescued by the Carpathia, the names of 326 passengers have been received by wireless up to a late hour this afternoon. The Carpathia evidently was out of wireless range towards noon, for after that efforts to reach the vessel with wireless were futile, and a score or more of messages from the Cunard company and other sources were unanswered.

For me it didn't get bad until after the D&C. I suppose I assumed that it would be the same this time. But then I have to remind myself that it was almost as if I had 3 weeks to deal with the shock of it all before I actually "lost" my baby. This time I knew that I couldn't deal with the emotional turmoil associated with waiting for things to happen naturally as my body obviously has a very difficult time letting go. I gave myself one day to let in soak in, to say goodbye to my sweet child, and then took Cytotec again (which this time didn't even make me bleed at all) and had the D&C on Thursday.
The baby and the toddler grew up, and became teenagers, capable of getting their own carrots, thankyouverymuch, and of climbing out of bed all on their own. Taking down the crib rails was liberating for all of us.

Written for ages 6 and older this is one of many delightful books in the Katie Woo series. I no longer have children or grandchildren this age but the title reminded me of my 8-year-old granddaughter (kind of a Madame Fullcharge) and I thought she and I would have fun reading it together. She wasn't interested. Said it was too young for her. That might be because she just finishing up her 4th grade brothers book, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. Anyway I thought the book was great and I still think she would have enjoyed it. I'll bet if I could have figured out how to get it onto Kindle she may have read it.
What I have not found is any evidence that the motive for farm murders is “genocide”. The perpetrators are sometimes caught, tried and convicted. In how many of these cases has the motive been proved to be “genocide”? If the genocide propagandists can show that this morive has been proved in the majority of cases (a 51% majority will do), then I will be prepared to take their contentions seriously. But until they do that, I will take their assertions with several bags of salt, and merely white racist propaganda. Sannie sê Sannie sal sewe sakke sout sleep.

As someone with Type 1 diabetes (the "real" diabetes, as I like to put it -- the kind you can't help getting), I sometimes wonder when I'll end up retiring, or how long I can escape death. So I wonder how much I should be saving for retirement. Will I get the typical 25-30 year long retirement? Or would I have to retire at 40 to pull that one off? If I work until I'm 65, I could have lots put away, only to die within 2 years if I'm lucky, on the other hand.

But going down through the water to touch the wild man at the bottom of the pond is quite a different matter. The being who stands up is frightening, and he seems even more so now, when corporations do so much work to produce the sanitized, hairless shallow man (2) That's poor Viggo in THE ROAD, a sanitized man re-bearded, trying to be wild in a wild land, having to re-learn the role of the deep, dark masculine and getting it incorrect. No reflection on Viggo, of course, who showed he can bring that shit hardcore in the RINGS films and HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. It's more I think the head-on craftsmanshippy approach to the McCarthy novel -- it gets it too right, maybe, to work.

We’d decided on going to the Cartoon Museum in London when we read about an exhibition of work by one of the greatest cartoonists of all time, H.M. Bateman. He was the man who pioneered short or no-caption drawings which were such a welcome contrast to the rather heavily laboured pieces favoured by the Edwardians and Victorians. He also did fabulous caricatures, but was best known for his series about ‘The Man Who…’, which included toe-curling embarrassing moments, such as a guardsman who dropped his rifle on parade and a junior officer who ate the colonel’s starter at a regimental dinner. He did superb irate older men with popping monocles and incandescent eye-brows. We both laughed outright many times in the exhibition – and nobody went Shhhhh… It’s a great place: very cheap to get in, an excellent shop and the show itself was superb: very well-lit and arranged and with full, detailed captions. I can report that the Cartoon Museum hasn’t caught the almost universal disease of British museums who seem to think their visitors are either ill-informed half-wits, or pre-school children.

He graduates in May with his degree in Recreation Therapy. He had a nice surprise waiting for me when I pulled into the driveway at 11PM two days before Christmas. The lighted deer and Christmas tree were in the front yard set up and glowing, attached to the Christmas lights lining the front porch my oldest son, Kerry Lee, had helped me put up during the warm spell right after Thanksgiving. Then when I came into the house I saw that Tim had set up and decorated the Christmas tree, hung the Christmas stockings for everyone including the dogs and cats, and had decorated the rest of the house as well! What a blessing!

I had extra batter so I made two other small pans of bread to use as samples at the market. The pans are really small; I felt like I was cooking with my Easy Bake Oven! Also, as my loaf tins were smaller, I baked them for about 20 minutes.
This is an invitation to come to South Africa, if you have the guts, because we all know you do not have the guts to face up to your own filthy handy-work, you cowardly sick deluded immoral scum!
The good folks at BulkAmmo.com sent along not only the reduced recoil Rio loads, but also some Sellier & Bellot standard buck, and some S&B 3" magnum buckshot as well. The three loads nicely stack into a good comparison of reduced recoil loads vs. standard, and the 3" magnum shells add a 'spice' to the mix.
Charles describes Google as the elephant in this particular room (in the proper sense of the very big thing that no-one mentions), drawing the conclusion that Google’s appointment last summer of Autonomy’s Jack Halprin is a sign that Google wants a slice of the eDiscovery market.

"His raucous singing, grating voice, inane grin, horrible, unfunny films, and constant twanging on the most unmelodic instrument ever invented, scraped on the nerves like a hollow tooth and made George the worst artist this country has ever produced.

The President of the society pointed to first drawing and said: "This is a woman. We can see these people held women in high esteem. You can also tell they were intelligent, as the next symbol is a donkey, so they were smart enough to have animals to help them till the soil.

SB 10.88.25-26: The great demigods could only remain silent, not knowing how to counteract the benediction. Then LordSiva reached the luminous realm of Vaikuntha, beyond all darkness, where the Supreme Lord Narayana is manifest. That realm is the destination of renunciants who have attained peace and given up all violence against other creatures. Going there, one never returns.
Don’t lose your soul trying to please someone else. Focus on growing as an individual. Praise from others doesn’t always equate to peace of mind. Take their words with a grain of salt. You’re priceless. Nothing will ever change that.
The day of the big dance, the twins are instructed to clean their rooms and while doing so, Elizabeth discovers George's letter to Enid. Using her mad Jessica Fletcher skillz, she finally deducts that it was her unhinged sister that told Ronnie about George. Of course, instead of confronting her like a normal person, Elizabeth begins to plot her revenge. Seeing as the last book established her unique brand of crap vengeance, she's probably just planning to hide Jessica's hairbrush or something.

Spirits are much more in check but hoping to be back on track by the end of the week. Keeping my head above water and thinking blue sky thoughts is the order of the day.
Now, "making an example" of someone, to me, is the stuff of wartime prison camps. Not civil courts in peacetime. You cannot reasonably over-punish a high-visibility convict to deter those who might follow. Not fair. Nor, of course, could punishment by proxy be justified, supposing it were provable. Fact is, though, that a young man who clearly has some problems is being locked in with people who are more likely to supplement his trauma than to show him the way to enlightenment. And we are paying for it. I would say that the law is an ass. But I don't want to be in contempt of court, do I?
It is difficult to make a living from writing. I haven't cracked it yet, although I can see my income growing as I get more interest from foreign publishers and - crucially - manage to keep on producing books. If I compare it, though, to my career in journalism, I'm quite happy. Although I could earn considerably more with a staff job on a national newspaper (and they aren't any easier to come by than getting a book deal), my salary would be pretty much my limit. Whereas a book..well, anything could happen. It's possible for a book to earn for you again and again - a foreign sale here, a film deal there - while you're working on other stuff.
I've been dating a little bit, and its been fun. Both men and women. There is one very pretty grrrrr in Ellensburg but it seems like we are both gravitating in different directions. I've found someone that I think I really like, and I'm a little surprised because it is not someone that would ever catch my eye...I mean, the kind of person that you go by in the grocery store and don't even notice. But once you make yourself look, well, his heart is like a kaleidoscope of radiant gems and syrups. My own juices are flowing with the bright heat of summer, and love is floating with the fuzzy cotton tree seeds in the wind.

Besides, isn’t state-ism itself a religion for most Americans? Do they not honor the state above all else, above even the commandments of a conventional religion they may embrace? If their religion tells them “thou shalt not murder,” but the state orders them to murder, then they murder. If the state tells them to rob, to destroy property, and to imprison innocent people, then, notwithstanding any religious strictures, they rob, destroy property, and imprison innocent people, as millions of victims of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and millions of victims of the so-called Drug War in this country will attest. Moreover, in every form of adversity, Americans look to the state for their personal salvation, just as before the twentieth century their ancestors looked to Divine Providence.
My theme for this month is Go Outside. Weird, possibly, but relevant, particularly since in just 21 days I will be swimming 5km for Marie Curie Cancer Care. In the last month I have done precisely no training whatever, so I’m very likely to not make my target of under an hour and a half, but I will complete the 5km, come hell or high water. I plan to go to the gym every day for the next 21 days, starting tomorrow. It’s a good theme, I think. I plan to spend regular time outside or at the gym, even if it’s only half an hour. Money is tight again now, but going for a walk is free and it’s a good way to spend time with my kids, my man or just myself. I tend to do my best thinking in the five minutes it takes me to shower – I’ve come up with all sorts of speech ideas and blog posts, you wouldn’t believe it. I hope that a couple of hours in the gym every day will give me lots of great thinking time and lots of fabulous ideas will flow.

I am truly blessed to be able to do the work I do. Over the years, my practice has evolved to the point where it is now about 50% Life Coaching and 50% Business Coaching. I love helping people create and grow their businesses as much as I enjoy supporting clients on their personal journeys. Often, the two overlap.
I was about to walk on when they stood and one bent over the seat and lowered shorts and the other showed the silhouette of his manhood as he mounted up from behind.
A few years ago I discovered ‘osteopathic manipulative treatment’ (OMT) and the pain in my knee mysteriously disappeared. But by then I was fully in the throes of motherhood and exercise had been off the table for so long that I didn’t know how to get it back into my life. I still don’t really know how I will accomplish this task, I just know that I must. I need an exercise montage. I need abdominal muscles.
We divied up the three mags among those of us without a closet full of porn hidden at home. My brother found mine and absconded with it within the week which probably saved me trouble later down the road.

Sitting with a pint of larger and a gaggle of friends (maybe a boyfriend). Feeling a moral victory as City were not ,all, about money. The great fan loyalty that saw season ticket sales rise when we were relegated.

Google now has a head start on its rivals in the fiercely competitive cloud computing market, thanks in part to deals inked with the US Patent and Trademark Office and the General Services Administration in the past year. In both cases, Google enjoyed the benefits of support from federal chief information officers. In both cases, a few people involved in the process voiced objections.

The Chairman of the CFR is Robert E. Rubin, who served under Bill Clinton as Treasury Secretary and headed Clinton’s National Economic Council. He was a Clinton crony. Rubin’s ties to Clinton are interesting, since Bill Clinton was Jesuit-trained at Georgetown University, where he was close to the Jesuit faculty (became Class President in his junior year). Rubin has served on the board of the Center for National Policy (CNP), which is led by it’s President, Roman Catholic Tim Roemer (A graduate of the Roman Catholic University of Notre Dame).
It took all morning but we finally convinced Tali that she was two. She kept saying, "No!" but that her response to everything these days. ;) She didn't want to blow out the candles because she just wanted to dig into the cherry tomatoes. Those were the favorites and the first to disappear. Tali also ate the apples and sampled the cucumbers. Ana ate tomatoes, oranges, apples, cucumbers, and celery. She sampled the peppers. Amanda ate everything after arranging it all neatly on her plate. We didn't get to the pineapple so we'll try that at snack time.

Perhaps it’s no surprise then that the Mirror Pool has suddenly become my favourite place in the city. It’s a sign of all that God’s promised for Bradford is, in fact, coming. The wells of the Spirit are, in fact, now open. The curse IS lifted and Bradford IS free, she just doesn’t realise it and so lives as if it isn’t. But ‘there is a time coming, and is now here’, when Bradford will begin to realise that she IS loved by this Father who gave everything for her, even Jesus, and gives His Spirit without measure, and that she DOES have a future. This city is NOT what the media and some of her people paint her to be.

TMT, developed over 20 years ago by social psychologists, explains how humans come to cope with death anxiety by developing self-esteem and attributing purpose to life. However, we do this by shoring up our own cultural identities, self-esteem, and frankly become more conservative in the way that we view others who might threaten our world view. So while Dark Tourism might make us feel all the better about being alive, it may make us less tolerant of others which just seems so counter-intuitive.

All of the above started flying at me through the phone. Remember, she's never even met him or seen the amount of vomit coming out of him. The last two weeks had already been filled with her judgments about everything from where he was sleeping and how many times we'd left the house. SHE was stressing me out and that isn't helping for milk supply either.
You know the old phrase, "Stop and smell the roses"? I think stopping to smell the lilacs is even more important since their luscious blooms only happen for a short time each year. I have to remember to jam my nose into their blooms (checking for bees first, of course) and drink up all their sweet fragrance often before it's gone.
From the other lane, coming towards us, we begin to see the cause of the hold-up. Marching towards us in crisp precision was a phalanx of police officers. No ordinary officers these as they were clad in riot gear complete with helmets and shields. They were surrounding about forty protesters and they were all making their way south.

But Tom Hiddleston. Man, is Tom Hiddleston good. He plays Loki the same way he played the character in Thor, not as a cartoon villain but as an at times sympathetic man torn between the way he regards his brother with both familial love and burning jealousy. There are scenes between Thor and Loki where you can almost see Loki willing to put an end to all of this, but too far in to stop now. Loki is not absolutely a villain, and none of the heroes are absolutely heroes. They all have doubts and moments of cynicism. It's what elevates the movie beyond merely a collection of character moments and an action-packed third act: the continuing thread about what the nature of heroism really is, where it comes from, and how it can be used to affect the world. It was there in Captain America: The First Avenger when Steve Rogers told Dr. Erskine "I don't want to kill anybody. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from." It was there when Thor learned how to wield his power for others and Tony Stark conquered his daddy issues.
Did you know that in the world today there are 143 million orphans? They have no family to claim them and no parents to call their own. Many of them age out of the orphanages and become homeless, turning to drugs, suicide, or prostitution. Yet they are not without hope! The Lord cares for the orphans and following God’s call in our life, we desire to give them a home, love, and a family to call their own. Please join us in praying for the orphans around the world that they would have enough food to eat, for someone to care for them, and for their protection. Please also pray that God would care for and provide for them until their adopting families can come get them. Pray that God would give us wisdom, discernment, and insight as we raise our adopted children.
This post wants to highlight the challenges, that come along with the recent phenomenon of Chinese tourists, as well as discuss Taiwan's current struggles as a travel destination and travel nation. Taiwan is truly a big step ahead of China, when it comes to travel etiquette and service, however, there is still room for improvement. I believe, that we need to give Chinese tourists some time, they will make mistakes and we need to firmly point them out, but they will also learn and improve through time - some more, some less. I'm interested to hear what you say! Here are some of my questions:

The biggest emotion, though, is probably regret. Even though I was at the hospital several different times the week before he died, I never found the courage to really talk to him, to tell him that I forgave him for all the bad stuff. For the most part, I put all that behind me a long time ago, and focused on remembering the good times, the memories that can still make me smile. And that man is the one I miss, the man I wish was still here for Amy, to walk her down the aisle, to spoil our grandchildren, to sing to them.....

It reminds me of the first day he started primary school (but so much worse). He was well adjusted, happy, so ready and all smiles. I was all smiles on the outside also but came home and sobbed a million tears. A time of change and also no other littlies at home to focus on as had been my hope and dream.

I'm also in love with Frannie's family! Her parents are charming and protective. She has four other sisters (one named Maggie!) who are fun whenever they're included. Really, I think all of the side characters help liven the story and make it more realistic.
The story begins last May when, out of the blue, I received an email from Australia. Mick, the sender of said email, had stumbled across my blog when he was researching his family history. He introduced himself and explained that he had been through Kolky before and was very excited to learn that there was someone who he could communicate with now living in this village. His connection to Kolky, as well as other villages in my general area, came from some documents of his wife's side of the family. He also explained that he and Julie were coming to Eastern Europe again (among other places on their 6 week excursion) to retrace some of their steps, do some more searching and continue their investigation. Also he mentioned that one of their stops was Kolky!
How can we practice and improve our own self-compassion? First of all, we have to stop being a drill sergeant with ourselves. The use of words “have to”, “should” and “ought to” in our life can set us up to fail; as in “I have to go to yoga class every day this week”. This is probably not a realistic goal and when you fall short, you’re likely to feel bad about it. Instead of “have to” try to motivate yourself to exercise because it feels good or you want to be healthier. Self-compassion is also related to personal happiness. Instead of dwelling on the negatives, make a list of five things that make you happy. It may be getting out into nature, sipping a really good cup of coffee, spending time with a friend…the list goes on.

I remember when my babies were born I would hold them and stare at them for hours. I would study every facet of their face every day. It was such a joyous time to bond with them and appreciate every miraculous thing about them. They were beautiful, amazing little beings and I could stare at them forever.
The test results would let me know which part of the lesson I hadn’t studied enough. I wasn’t an inquisitive kid. My method of learning was answering questions, not asking them. Only when I am asked questions will I discover what I still didn’t know or understand.
This has led to legal repercussions on more than one occasion.

As we approached Shoreditch, I spotted this building. I couldn’t see a date on it but it looks Victorian. A deliciously extravagant design, this pub was once called Ye Olde Axe but the name has been painted over and the swinging sign has all but lost its paintwork. The building looks neglected and in need of repair, like something out of a Gothic horror film. An illuminated sign on the side reads “Striptease”. Unsurprisingly, the clock no longer works. It is very sad to see buildings like this being allowed to fall into a state of neglected disrepair.

I bet you were just a $15-$20 product, but I felt like I was on the road to cooking awesome food when I unwrapped your box. (It was Christmas, I think.) You only had a two year warranty, and, to be honest, I didn’t think you’d last past it.

This studio is now gone, and nobody will ever record in it again. It was Sandro’s house for a long time. Over ten years I believe. And he was always paying rent, and, after he turned it into a studio, the owner would not sell the house to him without trying to rip him off. Now it is part of a history that involved a lot of people, a lot of music, a lot of concentration and dedication – a history that has moved into other places and other songs, that can’t be stopped but which remains alive thanks to recording and sharing technologies.

We all know our mistakes and we're well aware of all the obvious ways we mess up and keep messing up. It's also one of the many reasons, we avoid God. Too many people think of God as the Judge of the Universe and feel unworthy to pray, step foot in a church, and hate the feeling of condemnation they feel when comparing themselves to what they ought to be doing.

Every time the subject of marriage comes up, I have to shake my head at the single girls I know. Some of them are younger than I am, some of them are my age, some older. They all want that holy grail of dating and relationships - a husband. It's like some crowning achievement. An end game. Life would only be complete if I had a husband.

I realise that this could upset some residents of the 20th arrondisement but I’ve never been good at keeping foodie secrets. Saturday night I dined at Cyclo, a tiny Vietnamese restaurant on rue de Belleville, and soon discovered why it’s one of the neighbourhood’s best kept secrets. The place was full to the brim, with most of the patrons on a first-name basis with the owner – a charmingly flamboyant Vietnamese native who takes the utmost pride in each dish that comes out of his kitchen.

There was a problem, though, in that, when they were attempting to insert a guide wire-thing into her esophagus, they popped a hole in her LARYNX. So, they had to take out all their guides and scopes and instruments while the doctor consulted with another laparoscopic doctor and an ENT to decide if this was a big deal. Apparently, it should heal on its own, provided there isn't any infection, so they just sewed up the hole, put everything back in, and finished the operation; hence, FIVE AND A HALF HOUR surgery.

This was the most recent occasion where I've discovered that my memory has improved or embellished an original. The usual trend with memory is that things fall out. In the case of movies, books, paintings and anything else remotely artistic I discover that the reverse occurs. My own aesthetic sense papers over the failings and produces a fine gloss on what might really be dross.

Chairman of the Man Booker Prize commented:
You do not win public backing for an argument about pensions by inconveniencing your parents.
The Kingdom of God starts small, a grain of wheat, a mustard seed, a leaven in the loaf. And it spreads, oh, yes, it grows. But it starts small, even hidden in the secret places, a knitting together of wonder, perhaps. A candle on a lamp stand, a woman searching for a coin, a man in a field with a treasure worth selling everything to possess.

Between the other tacos, there was the chorizo, which was cooked with the eggs (i.e., the way a chorizo and egg breakfast taco should be prepared). That being so, the filling had only minute seasoning. I was underwhelmed.
“If this group of members carry out activities prejudicial to the party interests, we will not hesitate to institute disciplinary action against such members irrespective of their positions.”
The sheer random chance of such an encounter was part of the danger inherent in the setting. On the other hand, you could encounter a group of giant rats or one cave bear by itself. There needs to be more random elements to things while providing players, in the option of the stone giants, with the opportunity to retreat if and when needed.
At about ten o'clock in the morning the sun threw a bright dust-laden bar through one of the side windows, and in and out of the beam flies shot like rushing stars.You don't usually read that kind of thing in a play. But there isn't a lot of it, and so the overall effect is streamlined and minimal- no philosophical rambling or wordy imagery. Big hearts for Steinbeck in this department. I want to read more novel-plays. (Recommendations please!)

You might notice the poll in the top left corner. I'm starting a book club! If you're interested, tune back in on Wednesday when we take on the fun challenge of choosing our first book!
Thanks for stopping by today!! Tomorrow will be my last post here at HALLMARK LADYBUGS! It's been FUN and I hope you've enjoyed it too!
I think, more often than not, we try to play God and work through our own problems instead of depending on Him to help us through. And this is where the book In the Eye of the Storm comes into play.

Look Back in Anger is “Kitchen Sink” drama and and in 1956 provided a focus for disillusionment and frustration, for the rebelliousness of a generation that felt lost and betrayed after the certainties of the past. The emotional tirades of Jimmy Porter, the central character, against the drabness and smugness of the class system woke people up like a breaking window. The audiences were used to genteel, quaint, drawing-room dramas and the deeper but quiet dramas of Terrence Rattigan.
The Finale
Our estimates suggests male grades fall signi cantly with the success of the football team.
But The Phantom, it seems, has been histroically overshadowed by the truly staggering popular reception that greeted the debut of Superman, and his equally colourful cohorts (such as Batman, Captain America, et al), from the 1940s onwards. Perhaps he simply wasn’t ”super” enough to stand out amongst the growing throngs of super-powered crime-fighters that crowded American comic-books for the duration of World War II. Even as costumed superheroes reasserted their status (after a decade-long hiatus) as the dominant American comic-book genre throughout the 1960s, The Phantom remained a secondary character, despite earning his first self-titled American comic-book series in 1962.
Ok, so I know I've already done a section on Bendis' New Avengers (and The Mighty Avengers)but I feel like a wanna do a brief recap as #26-#31 as just been collectively released as 'REVOLUTION'. I'm a big fan of The New Avengers,but I gotta say it reads better in trade form than it does in single issues(lets be honest,most of Bendis' single issues you can read in less than 5 minutes),the flashback style narritive sits a lot easier and the constant scapes with Electra and the Hand makes it a lot pacier and this is easily the best storyline since 'BREAKOUT'(ok, you gotta love 'Secrets and Lies').

Here is my newest pet, purchased last week at a garden show. I was told this is a Chinese Sedum succulent, and I fell in love with it in this trophy-shaped urn. There were so many booths dedicated to succulents, terrariums, and fairy gardens. It was so much fun!
The point here is surely not to deride empiricism. Heaven knows conservatism could stand to quit leading with its heart and start thinking more empirically about the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The point, if I’m reading them correctly, is that too many leading voices on the left give themselves over to wonkiness, and presume that their moral convictions are widely shared, such that the only reason anybody could disagree with them is through ignorance (willful or not), or malice.

I got fired while being in a sick leave (which is legal in Spain). However, because of my good and hard work, the company gave me a laptop, signed me up for a legal advice bureau for a month (I was fighting my disability docs by then) and gave me a very good recommendation letter.
Nursing-sadly no. Mama dried up and Jonah wasn't getting nearly enough so we weaned. It was sad but then it was freeing for me. I was either pregnant or nursing for over three years! That's a long time so I was kinda happy to have my body back although I would have nursed longer, as long as he wanted if it had been possible.
In addition to this study-load I threw myself under a Roadlink Bus by opting to sign up for the Google AdWords Certification Program to increase my work capabilities (requires min 85% to pass). This means the possibility of not only getting run over by a bus but having it crumble on top of me too! Yikes! For those not in the know, check out why I’ve made reference to Roadlink here :-P
* Steampunk as Social Change
Tonight (Sunday April 15, 2012) is the last night of our Spring Break, and I have to say we are all a bit gloomy. We have had soooo much fun together. I really do love spending time with my family, and we had fun this week. Here is a recap in pictures.
If there was an award for courage in the cricketing world, it should very well be named after Bob Willis. When he was 26, he had operations on both his knees, which meant he was in constant pain whenever he played. In fact, on certain days, he needed to run five miles in order to generate the strength to play. It was only through his will that Willis managed to play and succeed at the top level for nine more years. At 6 feet 6 inches, Willis was an intimidating fast bowler, one of the fastest England have ever produced. His pace, bounce, aggression and swing made him deadly on all kinds of pitches across the world.
I don't know if this piece has any kind of value today. Maybe the fact that the whole set is now dismantled, must decrease its value. And although such ensemble was (and still is) far from cheap, my mom paid only half of its retail value because she could get it directly from the factory where one of her friend worked back then.
The new characters were incredibly underdeveloped; Angelica, Blackbeard, the Minister, and the mermaid all felt forced upon the audience as if we were suppose to enjoy them, but realistically they were just annoying. Angelica is mad at Jack for taking her virginity (wasn’t pirates suppose to be geared for Children?) Blackbeard hides in his cabin for most of the film (wasn’t he the scariest pirates of all time?) the Minister falls in love with the mermaid (who in this film can shoot spiderwebs from their wrists like Spider-Man) just because he sees her naked (again, Disney, Pirates, Children?) and the Mermaid needs to shed one tear (there were enough tears of pain from the audience to solve that problem).

Several people have asked me for easy, healthy recipes. I'm kind of a wing-it person, so I'm always on the look-out for good websites or books to help with quick, easy cooking. I found one that's definitely a keeper. Simple Food for Busy Families: The Whole Life Nutrition Approach is a fabulous resource with step-by-step instructions on how to turn your family's bad eating habits around. The first half of the book addresses everything from getting enough sleep to why it makes sense to eat seasonal food. Each section gives practical tips on how to implement changes slowly in your family's routine so that eventually you're eating better and feeling better.

Another example: say for instance the biggest fear of a Black Government is a White Right-wing backlash. What do they need to do? Plant a few bombs in Black areas; blame it on a Right-wing organization (that you created) and you can keep the All Alleged Accused in prison for four years without a trial (as with the Boeremag). Better still…the public will support you.
The yellow shoes I made were turned, literally. Made inside out, then flipped. The outer sole is stitched directly to the uppers. This style is around and fashionable for all of our time period. It is the least durable, since it cannot be re-soled and has to have a thinner sole to be able to be turned. However, this makes it the daintiest of shoe styles.
Keep the Chinese New Year theme going. Bang on a drum by your snow fire. Grab whatever makes a ruckus and traipse through your house, making as much noise as possible. This is a great way to chase away bad luck and make room for good fortune. You can also clean your house for the New Year, but that's not quite as fun.

First I placed a straight pin through the center of a red felt Pretty Posy, then I placed it through each section of the wheel as I bent it in. Then I used the pin to attach the pinwheel to the eraser of the pencil. I bent the pin down and taped it securely to the pencil so no fingers would get pricked.

By the time Douglas Jardine’s Bodyline series came around, Bradman was only 24 and had already scored 2695 runs in 19 Tests at 112.3 with 12 centuries, including the world record score of 334. The Bodyline was his weakest series but he still managed 396 runs in 4 games at an average of 56.75 (higher than the career averages of Lara, Tendulkar, Chappell, Gavaskar and Ponting). He scored 12 double centuries in just 80 innings and registered a further seven 150+ scores. His tragically legendary average of 99.94 is one of the most widely known sport statistics worldwide. He is not just the greatest batsman in cricket history but also one of the greatest sportspersons ever, with the Time magazine rating him alongside the likes of Muhammad Ali, Babe Ruth, Juan Manuel Fangio and Pele. Bradman is much more than an icon or a hero; he is a figure that transcends the game he played and stands for something much greater than that. Bradman is the epitome of the pinnacle of human achievement in sports.
High Priestess Ondelle is convinced by an old proverb that Brigitta is fated to travel to the former home of the Ancients to help her find the answer. But when they get there, they discover that hundreds of years ago, when the faeries were moved north to the protected realm, some faeries were left behind.

Come to think of it, there’s really no difference between Mandela and Taylor. Mandela supporters terrorized the black majority into electing him president in 1994, after South Africa had been at war against communist forces since the mid-1960’s. Taylor, following a peace deal that ended the Liberian Civil War, also terrorized the population into electing him president in the 1997 general election.

One thing I have noticed after watching a number of these space shows is that unless you're watching a live feed from the space station, nobody can make a space show about ANY planet or moon without mentioning and showing digitally rendered footage, at least four times in an hour-long show, of a huge asteroid hitting the Earth and wiping out our entire existence. They're obsessed. Though I feel that the obsession probably has more to do with sensationalism to boost ratings than an obsession with the end of the world as we know it. The way they work that scenario into every show smacks of the sensationalism used to get people to watch the news every night. Jackasses.

As for trying two new activities a month, I’ve decided that one a week would be more fun, and give me an excuse to try to write once a week as well. I’ll try to keep that content a little more locally based but the dig in challenge can really be done wherever you are. I don’t think it matters where in the world you live, supporting your local economy is important.

The crazy thing is that I never shared my passions, not even with my best friends. I think they may have guessed how obsessed I was with Star Wars and old movies. They had no understanding of my desire to be on stage. And I never once told them the name of the boy I had a crush on. At the time, I think I thought it was self-protection. That if my dreams didn't come true, at least no one knew about them, so I didn't have to be ashamed.
A movie like Red Tails which narrates the lives of such upstanding historical figures are exactly what the African-American society wants to see in the Big Screen. We’re constantly bombarded with negative, & comical depictions of our selves to see a film with respectable figures that reflect us is immensely relieving.

Established in 1892, CILEx was known as the Institute of Legal Executives (ILEX) in 1963 before changing its name in January 2012 when it received a royal charter. According to CILEx, 81.5 per cent of its members have parents who studied at university. Only 2 per cent of members have a lawyer for a parent. Clearly, CILEx operates in different circles from the magic-circle law firms, which have attracted criticism in the past for using the old boys’ network of recruitment.

You know, even though the use of the media in this book was slightly exaggerated, it is true, people of our age have no other source of information. All we know about the wars, the natural disasters, and etc. we know from media. The media does have the power to motivate, demotivate, and form the opinion of the people.
The Territory is often referred to as the ‘Top End’ and is also home to ‘the Alice’ and ‘the Red Centre’. It has plenty of ‘Outback’ and ‘Dreamtime Land’ and a rather large portion of extreme ‘bugger all’. Rainforests and deserts, long gun barrel straight highways, magnificent picture postcard scenery and two centres of population – Darwin at the top bit and Alice Springs in the middle. That’s about it.

That view, of connections to one another, could have begun in the ancient Jewish belief of blessings and cursings. The translators of Christ’s words may have been a bit leery of the idea of cursing someone. “Blessed are the meek” was fine. But cursing the un-meek? Did they change the words so that we read now the easier-to-digest “woe unto him”? As in, perhaps, “woe unto him who hurts the least of these, the children…” . Sounds safe enough until you realize this may be an example of the Jewish belief in cursing someone, in proclaiming your hope in his receiving his just desserts for a particular behavior. Pedophilia, anyone?

I just find the anti-German critique of certain trends and tendancies in the anti-capitalist/anti-imperialist/anti-globalisation movement(s) interesting and useful. And I felt that there was a need for some of that analysis to be more widely disseminated in the anglophone radical scene, which was the mission of this blog originally. That’s all.

I’m sitting here at 10am in a condo that is much more empty than it was 12 hours ago. My tv is gone, my coffee table is gone, and most importantly the boxes of my exes stuff that i had hidden behind the couch for the past 5 months is gone. I didn’t know how it would go today. My last relationship was a tricky one. I’d have to say it was honestly the worst and most dysfunctional relationship I’ve ever had in my entire life (i’ve had a total of 3 boyfriends).

In the end, we got everything cleaned out and they apartments offered them a new apartment since the condition of the carpet, walls, and just everything in general was in such deplorable condition. I also told them that I wouldn’t help them a second time. I don’t think I could handle doing something like that more than once. I even refurnished their new place since all their furniture was ruined. T.V., couch, tables and chairs, beds, dressers, etc. I found all of it for them. Most of it was donated and some were my personal things.

As stated in his book “The Leadership Engine”, Tichy Noel reinforces that learning is a key requirement for developing leadership. We enhance our unique qualities through learning and education. Studying abroad was probably one of the richest experiences of my life. It was a privilege to study for my MBA at Duke, The Fuqua School of Business. It was a unique moment of my life. The globally focused education allowed me to make a deep personal assessment while providing me with an actionable set of global leadership tools. (Not to mention that I met my wife during my MBA, this is awesome).
When I was in college, I had also worked on the programming side of radio. One of my favorite projects was a weekly show I initiated, combining the music and folklore of different cultures. (I like to claim I invented world beat.) I knew almost nothing about either, so it was a big adventure each week to go to the university’s excellent music-school library and rummage through the record bins.

I wore my sunsuit when I played on the backyard swing set. But, you couldn’t get in the car wearing this. Oh, no, that would not be appropriate. I had to put on another outfit if I was going to leave the yard. That outfit had to stay in the yard. I guess I would have been labeled a tramp or something. Nowadays you can go to Walmart in your pajamas without anyone batting an eye, but back then, you couldn’t walk out of the yard in your bathing suit. No sir re Bob.

The rules vary from high school to high school, Uni to Uni and from State to State and even from pub to pub with paddles being used by some to hit the ball and some use quarters instead of balls.

I guess if you are using Bud for the beer, it may give the stuff some semblance of flavour.

The other concern the WEF report raised was the short-term increase in carbon dioxide projected for Germany which, with today’s global warming problems, cannot be taken lightly. The report say that “carbon emissions will also rise, with an increase of between 170 million and 400 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between 2011 and 2020, as Germany turns to coal and gas plants to replace nuclear generation in the short-term.”

Well, personally, I tend to spy a certain vulgarity when such impossibly subjective matters are stated like facts in this way (though I blame neither the brewery nor the organisers of this event for feeling the need to enter into the spirit of a good old public relations exercise every once in a while). I do also wonder whether an ale of such bloodcurdling power really ought to be hailed in this way on a global scale - looking at it from moral/public health perspective.

Why would something that worked fine in the prior version and is apparently unchanged suddenly have a bug? A million to one shot based on my configuration? I guess I'll never know.

Although Chary ended up getting sick early Sunday morning I would have to say the trip was very enjoyable for everyone. I surely don’t get to see Grandiose, Frisuer, and Chary nearly enough so I greatly cherish the opportunities I do get with them. I am very hopeful that Grandiose is able to make a trip up for a regular season game when the tailgating is in full force along with all of the great traditions that take place before each and every home game at Notre Dame. I am sure Frisuer and Chary will remember the experience as well. I hope to do this again next year as well, but we will have to see if we are able to make it work out again for everyone.

Sundays are still bittersweet. It's a day off work and the thought of that day starts out glorious but quickly fades when my to-do list fills the whole day. And by the end of a busy day off, I could (and have) easily cry over the thought of returning to work the next morning for another 6 day stretch. But I do whats important. Sundays - there is church, visiting my grandpa, visiting my parents, getting housework done, grocery shopping, making dinner, spending time with Craig and Milo, and preparing for another 60 hour work week. So other than a lighter day at work I'm very much looking forward to the couple 40 hour work weeks I'll get to resume after tax season is over before Grayson arrives.

Holy shit. I had no idea how isolated we've become. We do not go out as a family. WHATSOEVER. Going out to dinner is, simply, out of the question. The likelihood of Bennett acting out, or throwing his food across the restaurant if something goes wrong, while not HIGH, is still high enough to where Jennifer and I both do not risk it.
On the one hand, it absolutely deserves an five-star review for its sheer audacity, innovation, and mastery of language. This is a very clever, beautifully written novel that manages to deliberately meander without boring the reader. It's also a very humorous novel, not so much in a laugh-out-loud sort of way, but one which succeeds in delivering a smile (or more often a smirk) per page. When I allowed myself to become lost in Arno's voice, I quite enjoyed the read, even as I rolled my eyes and scoffed at his good-natured laziness. It's no wonder Baker gets far more attention as a purveyor of literature than as a genre author, but you get the sense that's entirely how he likes it.

Buffalo Bills QB Ryan Fitzpatrick, a Harvard-educated alum, took the test in 2005 and got one question wrong. His score was one of the highest ever recorded by an NFL Draft prospect. He was asked was the Wonderlic a good indicator of how a player will perform at the next level? He just laughed. Fitzpatrick said that although he could see the potential connection between answering 50 questions against a ticking clock in a classroom and being able to process information at a rapid pace on the field, he wouldn’t read too much into a prospect’s test scores. ”Dan Marino has a low score when he took it, right?” He asked. ”I think his career turned out just fine.“

To do that, start with the bottom row, pick up the numbered block on the left, then pick up each block in turn until you have the whole row sitting in sewing order. Then I put that little pile on a plate. Repeat this process until you have all your rows sitting on a plate ready to be sewn. You do need to be a little careful at this point, if you trip over carrying this precious little plate of blocks, you will have to start the layout all over again!!!

While we're there we load up on still warm, fresh bagels and coffee. I also grabbed a Superfood drink for later. Now if you're not familiar with this, it's a fruit juice and Spirulina blend with several other goodies mixed in just for fun and giggles. It tastes great but looks kind of like pond scum, (i.e. thick and dark green) It tends to make people go "yuck" just by looking at it and phrases like, "you're not really going to drink that are you?" are common. To tell you the truth I think that's really why I like it. Armed with all the essentials, it's out to the car. Putting the bagels and juice behind the front seat we are now ready for our big adventure.
Not sure quite what Friday will hold in store, but I know I am going to continue asking the kiddos to put together their "wish lists" of what they would like to learn next year. So far, Kiddo #1 has come up with Astronomy, the Revolutionary War and airplanes. Go figure! ;-)

As Grace picked out clothing for Doris to wear, Doris looked at the blouse Grace had chosen with disgust and said, “Grace that has to be the ugliest blouse I have ever seen! Is that yours?” “This is your favorite blouse Mom. You’ve had it for over two years and worn it at least a hundred times.” Grace replied as she held up the garment. “That isn’t mine. I have never seen that blouse before in my life. Why would you say such a thing?” No one knows what she was thinking, but Doris wasn’t about to admit that she had forgotten. As she put on her socks Doris asked, “Did you check the mail, Grace?” “Yeah, Mom, Bubba brought it to you over an hour ago.” Grace answered as she walked over and picked up the mail and showed it to Doris.
This is an important distinction. Where early web technologies enabled people to communicate primarily with friends and family, today’s networks encourage discovery and new relationships. Twitter, for instance, helps people find others who share their interests and begin conversations with them. By using hashtags, Twitter’s simple indexing tool, college students can connect with thought leaders and fellow students, expanding their intellectual circles beyond the reach of their classrooms and campuses.

The day before the game, we explored Scottsdale, attended a pep rally with the Auburn masses, and met up with some of my parents' friends from "back in the day" at AU. Here's Mom with her fellow Phi Mu's.

If I don't chase my dreams, I'll go nowhere. If I do chase the dreams, then I might fall, but here's something else to remember: It's not only about the destination. The true joy is in the journey.
In India, one can actually see that a person who takes a bath in the Ganges waters daily is almost free from all kinds of diseases. A very respectable brāhmaṇa in Calcutta never took a doctor’s medicine. Even though he sometimes felt sick, he would not accept medicine from the physician but would simply drink Ganges water, and he was always cured within a very short time. The glories of Ganges water are known to Indians and to ourselves also.
Deep in to the first thirty minutes or so of the chick flick and I found myself thinking about story. Just the word and what it means. It was during the scenes in which the graduated “It” girls arrived in Abu Dhabi that my mind began to wander. You see this is where I noticed the story that had pulled me in during the first half hour shifted its focus from story telling to showiness. Somewhere, someone must have stated that the second installment of the movie must be bigger or needed more, I’ll use Ms. Bradshaw’s word, “sparkle” than its predecessor. Yeah I get it, in a vast sea of sequels they had to dream up some way for theirs to standout, but along the way they forgot about story. And how a well written, relatable tale can pull in and take hold of an audience every time.

So Shelly is the story of three friends, all modern-day high school students, based on the lives and personalities of the second generation of English Romantic poets: Gordon, Lord Byron; Percy Bysshe Shelley; and John Keats. After Shelly dies in what’s ruled a “sailing accident,” the other two steal the urn containing her ashes from her wake and attempt to fulfill her final wish to have them scattered on the very beach where her body washed ashore. In the process of completing their quest, Keats, as narrator, reveals the story of the trinity’s pasts, together and apart.
Geraldo made a statement that African American & Latino parents should know better than to let their children walk around with hoodies on because people will fear them. That’s the hood will give people cause to arrest, frisk and/or harass them. He actually stated that the hoodie was as much to blame for Trayvon’s murder as is Zimmerman. Yes, you read that right! This fool not only said, but then he tweeted it! Okay, well guess what? Zimmerman is not a police officer. Trayvon did not need to keep his hands and face in plain view of Zimmerman. Zimmerman sought him out and approached him. Trayvon didn’t put his hoodie on until he felt someone following him. Before that he was a teenager walking down the street in a sweatshirt on a cold rainy night. Unless the boy was picking a lock or peering through someone’s window, I’m not sure how he falls under a suspicious category. So its actually NOT the hoodie’s fault…it’s actually the ignorant vigilante’s fault this boy is dead!
Al-Doaifi then allegedly did the same thing to several others inside the Walmart.
This year tested that faith. There is no way around it: This was a lousy year in sports. Scandal. Disgrace. Crime. The horror in and around sports rose to previously unimagined depths -- the empire struck back, the dark side reigned. Penn State dominated the news, but there were charges elsewhere, in too many places, in Miami and Ohio State and Syracuse and, well, who could keep up? Players went on strike. Owners locked out. Fan favorites left town. Legends went on trial. Concussions. Perjury. PEDs.
No matter how funky things get, Withers plays it cool . We've all probably heard "Lean On Me" too many times by now. But next time, listen to the song in the context of all the gospel soul that was hitting the charts in 1972: Aretha Franklin's Young Gifted And Black and Amazing Grace, The Staple Sisters's "I'll Take You There", Jesus Christ Superstar. The Rolling Stones's "Let It Loose" and "Shine A Light"? Could the compassionate singer be JC himself?

Don't quote the book in the query letter. At this point you've told me NOTHING about the plot. You've used up 292 of your 250 words and you've not answered the main question of a query: what is the book about?
Most artists today get inspired by other people, literature, nature etc.; not by goddesses. Camille Claudel inspired the French sculptor Auguste Rodin, and was his muse. He expected her to be there for him, like a goddess would be. By doing so, he prevented her to make name as an artist herself. Recently, some specialists think that many sculptures of Rodin are actually made by Claudel.
When one adds to this the fact that the arts are not only an economic multiplier, but also a social and cultural multiplier in an economy in which jobs are becoming even less and less interesting, it can make more sense to implement arts support schemes than it does in periods when the work ethic seems to be operating at its full volume.

So we still need to paint and I have so many more ideas for decorating the space (including revamping the dining setting) but I have to be patient as other things need to be finished off first. I also can't wait for the alfresco deck to be built on the other side of the stacking doors. Good thing it is Winter so don't really want to sit outside as yet but in a couple of months I hope to.

The truth is, in spite of its colonial history, the Dutch don't do hierarchy – and no more so in business than socially. The Dutch mind-set is not altogether different to Ireland - staunchly strong on family and community - steeped in a history of culture and an attitude that anything can be achieved no matter what the adversity. If we differ in Ireland - it's because we love to feast on adversity and the bad weather and it creates a poetic and spiritual solace, rather than an ability to always move forward and turn what we hold dear into triumph. In the Netherlands, there is no fear of a lack of attachment or going it alone – no matter how small or great the aspiration.

I watched in my rear view mirror as she lifted her little hands in the air and shouted "I want to praise HIM!" and I just knew she totally understood! In her little way she was praising God. She didn't care if a car passed and saw her...she just did it!

Clearly, it's a very hip store to carry both of these books, but it reminded me that an awful lot of my book buying happens outside of the major book outlets. In a big bookstore, I admit that I sometimes get overwhelmed by the selection and tend to gravitate towards what I already know. I really appreciate those times when I can savor very curated environments, whether it's a quirky selection (like the store I mentioned here) or the focus of a cookware or gardening store. I tend to spend more time with the books, and I while I can often leave Barnes & Noble without a book, I never leave a speciality store empty-handed.

Ok, here's where I encountered some problems. Notice how the sides of my cake are SUPER brown, whereas the top is a nice green. This is bad. It makes the sides really tough. I think it means that it baked unevenly, also creating a dome shape on top. This became a problem later, when I went to slice it in half, horizontally. You'll see what I mean...more on this later.
Joe Lipa brought two of my favorite beers of the entire festival. The first was Orval Trappist Ale which poured a hazy light amber color with floral, citrus and spice aromas. Nice tart flavors with a surprisingly full bodied mouthfeel. There was a slight hop bite with cider-like flavors. Very complex and interesting. The next was Lindemans Gueuze Cuvée René. This beer poured a golden color with very gentle aromas of fruit. The flavors were tart and refreshing with hints of yeast and cellar-like flavors. This was a very simple beer with quite a bit of depth.

Yes, I know, I still haven’t done my Tag post or the two awards I’ve received, but I’ll be honest, writing and photography and thoughts about those things are always going to come first on this blog. It’s just who I am. I’ll get to those, though, really, I will.

So when is all of this stuff going to be pressed into service to make beer? Well, that's a question best answered by the folks at Flying Fish (they say test brewing could start in May). But whenever that day comes, to quote Dr. Emmet Brown, "you're gonna see some serious shit."

Rock Bottom Restaurant & Brewery Molly's Titanic Brown Ale
Our first destination, although we didn’t stop was a place called Macapa which is on the northern side of the Amazon where we picked up our pilot to show us the way down the river to Santarem. Didn’t see the pilot but this river is so convoluted with masses of islands and tributaries, you would get hopelessly lost, not to say run aground. They put up a special map of the river where our charts are and there are several rivers at the mouth which go on for miles and miles. Because of these islands, we passed very close to the shoreline which was littered with driftwood. The trees rose straight from the water’s edge and there were big reeds and grasses. Passing us, in the river were big clumps of green, various vegetation just drifting past with brown logs bobbing up and down. Thought they were crocodiles at first. Macapa, right on the equator looks like quite a large town, houses, tall buildings and some masts showing. Little huts down at the water’s edge, but didn’t see many people around apart from a few who were fishing in narrow boats. A tug boat called Titan was pulling two huge rafts piled high with sand and it was hot and humid out on deck.

Most long time readers of short stories consider either Trevor or Alice Munto (Canada) as the best world wide of contemporary short story writers. Trevor (1928-Mitchelstown, County Cork, Ireland) is a very prolific writer. In addition to numerous novel, he has written 100s of short stories. The Collected Short Stories of William Trevor is 1280 pages. I first encountered Trevor this week and will just comment briefly on the two stories (both published in The New Yorker) I read.

Today, we went even wilder! We went to the arcade!! I LOVE the arcade! I’m like a kid when I go to the arcade. I need to play everything, and all of it is so much fun! (Future boyfriends take note, taking me to the arcade can get you laid) People gave us weird looks as we ran around the whole place screaming every time we won or lost. I don’t get it. There is absolutely nothing weird about a dozen twenty-something (completely sober) girls at an arcade.

I did the round twice, went back home and sat down mentally drained. The image of the envelope laying on the street under the merciless tires of fast cars haunted me.

When a licensor sells proprietary machinery to a licensee, the terms for such a transaction can be shown in separate paragraph of the agreement, in a schedule attached to the agreement or in a separate sales agreement. On occasion, a licensee is permitted to buy machinery from a third party based on the licensed patents and/or know-how.

The first instant of cold as he embraced Clearsight was welcome, refreshing, numbing to the anxiety of being so far in conflict with the Wildren. It didn't last; the cold sharpened, pushed hard fingers through the centre of his forehead, and pain returned. At least he stayed distracted from worrying about Dora and Taslin. Even without the pressure between his eyes, the room revealed by his enhanced vision made sure of that.

When Abram finally requests the hand of his beautiful half sister Sarai, she asks only one thing- that he not take another wife. Her father finds this promise restrictive and only agrees if she makes a promise as well. She has to procure Abram a son and heir or else Abram’s promise is null and void. Sarai is confident that she can keep up her end of the deal, so she agrees.
February, 1946
Monday, February 8th was a great night. We had pizza at A Slice of Brooklyn and then we made a presentation at the 77th Precinct Community Council meeting. There were a lot of people – probably over 50. I was a little nervous because I have never done a presentation outside of school before. But, come to find out it was great and me and the other students did well.
UPDATE (1): 20th December, 2011. The Irish Times has the inside track today on the Daly settlement (1) 17-20 Bond Street has indeed, according to the newspaper, been sold to LVMH for €350m (GBP 300m, chances are that the GBP 300m is correct and at current exchange rates the price tag is €358m) and (2) the Dalys have handed back €80m of assets to NAMA which had previously, reportedly, been transferred by the Dalys outside the ownership of the specific borrowers and (3) the €80m handed back includes €17m in cash which was reportedly transferred by David Daly to his wife, Mary. The Irish Times reports that the settlement means ” NAMA has recovered the €457 million debt owed by Mr Daly and his family” but that statement presupposes the assets recovered by NAMA are worth the difference between the €457m face value of the loans and the €350m-odd proceeds from the 17-20 Bond Street sale to LVMH. However, this is beginning to look like a solid success for NAMA if (a) it has recovered the face value of loans which it bought at a discount from AIB and (b) NAMA didn’t lose the Daly challenge about consultation and (c) NAMA is not stuck with what are likely to be substantial legal costs – on this last point we should find out in January 2012 what is happening to costs.

This is really just basic scientific competence. If we can’t notice the stuff in some way, then believing that it exists is pointless. And if we can notice it, then we should be able to make sure it is where we think it is. If we back it into a corner, it won’t vanish into the aether, like the aether did.
leave all his land to his eldest son unless that son converted to Protestantism; if the son did not convert, then the land would be divided amongst all the dead man’s children, thus reducing the size of estates owned by Catholics. If a Protestant converted to Catholicism, they would be arrested, their land and assets would be seized and they would be imprisoned, without trial, for as long as the government liked. Irish Catholics were banned from buying land in Ireland; orphanages were banned from giving children to Catholic families for adoption; no Catholic could inherit land or money from a Protestant; no Catholic could own a horse worth more than £5; Roman Catholic priests had to register with the government and to inform them of their movements; special government permission had to be sought for the Mass to be said and it could not be celebrated for large congregations; only Protestant churches could be built from stone and near main roads, Catholic churches had to be constructed from wood and kept to the back roads or countryside. If a Protestant informed the government of anyone breaking the Penal Laws, then the government would be allowed to reward him by fining the local Catholic

Bath Salts for Mom.
In a section of the Sermon on the Mount in which Jesus challenges us to engage systems of domination with creative nonviolence, he offers this final, perhaps most radical, word, “Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you” (Mt 5:42). This verse challenges our most precious possession, control. When faced with how to best use our resources, this verse challenges our addiction to those resources and the power and privilege of deciding how they are used. Elsewhere, Jesus tells the rich young man that following him requires divesting himself of all his possessions and give to the poor, enacting Jubilee in his own life (Mt 19:16-22; Lk 18:18-30). There is a radical principle here summed up in the Psalms and the Jubilee in Leviticus 25 that God is the only absolute owner. Followers of Jesus are called to hold their possessions loosely as things to be used for God’s purposes and not their own accumulation or comfort.

I attended the opening night of “Greener” in The Gaiety Theatre last night. I’m always worried about going to comedies. I recall literally wanting to run out of “Run for your wife” in the same theatre many years ago. I like comedy to be intelligent and challenging, making you laugh by pointing out the ridiculousness of life and love, and the frailty and wonder of the human condition, rather than a series of obvious one-liners. I need not have worried. From the moment the four main characters commanded the stage, the atmosphere was electric and the tremendous script carried them along admirably.

Services from a specialized mechanic are explicit and therefore attract charges and service fees where they are due. The mechanic takes time to evaluate the problem before repairing or recommending a replacement. With skill and experience in dealing with a specific vehicle structure, the mechanic finds it an easy task to correct an anomaly and is therefore likely to charge less.

Yesterday was my birthday! I absolutely love birthdays. I don’t really know why – presents make me awkward, I don’t usually throw big bashes… but maybe it is something around the fact that you can’t help but reflect on how far you’ve come in a year and to celebrate it. After all, when one ‘turns’ 24, you’re actually concluding your 24th year of life, it only makes sense to celebrate it. But, it is also exciting to think about how much could change in the coming year and to imagine where I might be when I have my next birthday. Right now, all possibilities seem little more than a few flicks of the wrist to make a reality by February 6, 2013. I’m unbelievably excited for what my 25th year will bring.
The schisms which I believe cannot be placed within this category of schisms, let’s call it the Schism of Who is Right, are those of the Ashkenazim and Sfaradim, and that of the Talmuds Yerushalmi and Bavli, simply because we have two sides, in both cases, agreeing on the basic sources.
Down on the bay shore, Henry Yesler had been operating his sawmill since about two years ago. He had shut the machine off for the day, for this was a day like no other. He would soon join a few others of his American associates, to sign a treaty with the natives whose ancient lands were all around. Chief Seattle would arrive to represent the Duwamish and Salish peoples; he was known among the new settlers as a reasonable man, a leader who understood the tectonics of this moment’s history.

The mean average is where a random variable is most likely to land. The further you stray from the mean, the less likely you are to find something landing that far out. So, any kid who scored highly is much more likely to come closer to the 25% mean average next time.
As a woman I would suggest to other women who find themselves constantly in these scenarios to allow your man to handle the situation. If he chooses to play along and think it’s cute to have you in an awkward situation while he is feeding the egos of disrespectful floozies testing your resolve then toss his sorry insecure drama seeking ass aside. He is not worth your time nor energy in the long haul.

While we were at the dr's office I set The Bug up with a little notebook and some crayons but she was too curious to stay in the chair once Sweet Pea started screaming and squirming. She came over and stood next to me asking, "why are you crying, Sweet Pea?" and eventually, after nobody answered her and the screaming and struggling continued, she began to cry a little bit too, out of nervousness or worry or just plain empathy for her sister. The Bug is very easily pulled out of these things, though, by the offer of a lollypop from the nurse. She doesn't hold grudges. Sweet Pea remembers, though... she was like, "to hell with your lollypop, lady; Mom, get me the frack out of here NOW." I bought her a smoothie (I know, we're Jamba Juice fiends) and brought her home and put her on the couch and turned on her favorite cartoon (currently Peep and the Big Wide World) and she's been chilling out there ever since.

While they look beautiful and they did a great job, I regret not taking more time to decide. I had never painted anything before (at the time this was happening) so the thought of painting them myself and having it look professional seemed impossible. But if I had waited 6 months I probably would have had them just add the molding and doors and then we would have done the painting. They used a special kind of paint which makes it look professionally done (like we bought them white) but it’s not an easy paint to work with when you need to do touch-ups, and a white kitchen needs lots of touch-ups.

It was a grade ten class (or the tenth grade as they say down south, a form which always causes me to imagine the voice of James Earl Jones), mostly constituted with boys.

It was a group that could easily have gotten out of hand, but somehow, we found a way to co-exist, and it actually turned out to be quite a good class.

In 1968, the 140 year old London Bridge had started to sink into the Thames. Instead of trying to rescue it, the Corporation of London sold it for US$2.5m. American entrepreneur Robert P McCulloch had the bridge dismantled and sent by barge to California, where it was rebuilt at Lake Havasu. Near the bridge is an “English Village” which pays homage to our culture, while here our authorities are destroying it. It has Tudor-style architecture, and the shops and restaurants create the atmosphere of ‘Olde England’, with tree-lined walkways and local breweries for hand-brewed ale.

Honestly speaking, I haven’t given much thought to praising this third book of the Caster Chronicles based on its first few chapters. All the way down through the middle parts, I have always told myself of how I find it boring me already and losing its “spark.” Perhaps because I thought since this was already the third release, and the authors have already ran out of ideas and plots for the story. Basically, I can’t help but compare the events to the former ones, that somehow, it already looks like the same plot over and over again only that this time, it is in a different package – the same visions, dreams, kelting, prophecies, shadowing songs, moons, bindings, and a whole lot more caster businesses that only readers of the book could understand.

In his book titled “Talent,” Talent Management thought leader Edward Lawler III says an organization’s “value proposition should include being a good place to work.” It follows that onboarding strategies are critical to retaining high performing individuals and essential steps in the Talent Management value chain. Unfortunately the importance of onboarding can sometimes be underestimated given the array of human capital management practices. It stands to reason – if you start new hires off on the right foot, they’ll be more engaged and more productive as a result.

A little messy, but nothing I couldn’t handle.

I really enjoy the Windsor’s scones, too. They always have two choices of tasty scones, a seasonal one such as cranberry or pumpkin and a classic one like maple or oat. They are very good. Not the best I’ve had (that honor would go to these incredible scones I had in the Clinton Hill section of Brooklyn, I think it was at Choice Greene, this magical artisanal cheese, grocer, baker and charcuterie shop near BAM, scones that were so authentically British and perfect in every way, they were better than some I’ve had in England! I also love the very Scottish/Irish scones at Babington’s Tea Room in Rome, which are dry and dense and crumbly and are served with freshly whipped clotted cream and Italian strawberry jam. Babington’s is a 19th-century tea room started up by two Englishwomen and it’s like stepping back in time. Some noted British food critics have claimed it’s more of an “English tea experience than one you’ll find in London, very classic.”

In other Spring-related news the clocks are going forward on Saturday, so I will be losing an hour's worth of sleep (boo!). This means darker mornings for a bit, but lighter evenings. One of my favourite things about living in the Northern Hemisphere is that, in summer, it stays light until 10:00pm at night. I love how you can leave work at 17:30 and still feel like you have a substantial evening ahead of you. I will also no longer have to run in the dark, hunkering close to the H37 bus route and sprinting passed dark alleyways and spooky driveways ... it's the small things in life.
That brings us to a situation that I am ashamed to even to bring up, but feel that I must as part of my healing process. Hubby has put me on shoe detention. Actually, he advised that I had to get rid of a pair for every new pair I bought. Now ladies, I know I don't have to tell you how utterly unfair and unjust this mandate is. I don't have any shoes that I don't want!
There was a musical I really wanted to take the girls to see, but I could never justify the costs. I thought about it multiple times, but it was never worth it to me. When the girls were seeing their relatives in Northern California, they were taken to see the musical. I was thrilled that they got to see it, and they loved it. And I was even happier that I hadn't broken the budget to take them myself.
Though I’m sure it doesn’t sound like it, I have gotten over quite a bit of my aggression and I’ve learned to forgive but I just simply won’t forget. I realize the “what ifs” and regrets are pointless. I’ve even developed relationships with the people who hurt me and I’m able to look past what I consider to be their mistakes because in the end, regardless of what that one day meant, we are happy and no one can take that away from us.
Man City obviously can’t be ruled out of the tie, but they have to score on Wednesday to have any chance of progressing. I wouldn’t dismiss this one going beyond 90 minutes, which depending on the scoreline, could well very work out in Man City’s favour if they have scored more than one away goal. Oddly, away goals only count until after extra time in the Carling Cup.

On May 25, 1961 President John Kennedy declared that we would land an American on the Moon before the end of the decade. That same week trumpeter Miles Davis played Carnegie Hall in New York City with his acoustic jazz group. Since the mid forties Miles had been a pioneer and innovator of such jazz styles as be-bop, cool jazz and now with Gil Evans they were even combining a symphony orchestra with his trumpet playing. Two totally separate events, but in July of 1969 man would land on the moon and be the farthest away he’s ever been from Earth. By the summer of ’69 Miles would have taken jazz far away from its traditional origins, leading an electric crusade into unchartered musical waters.

Under this provision, one who is not a member of the court at the time an adjudication is made cannot take part in the adjudication. The word “adjudication” means decision. A case can be adjudicated only by means of a decision. And a decision of this Court, to be of value and binding force, must be in writing duly signed and promulgated (Article VIII, sections 11 and 12, of the Constitution; Republic Act No. 296, section 21; Rule 53, section 7, of the Rules of Court). Promulgated means the delivery of the decision to the Clerk of Court for filing and publication.

Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known to the world as the beloved Dr. Seuss, was born in 1904 on Howard Street in Springfield, Massachusetts. Ted's father, Theodor Robert, and grandfather were brewmasters in the city. His mother, Henrietta Seuss Geisel, often soothed her children to sleep by "chanting" rhymes remembered from her youth. Ted credited his mother with both his ability and desire to create the rhymes for which he became so well known.Although the Geisels enjoyed great financial success for many years, the onset of World War I and Prohibition presented both financial and social challenges for the German immigrants. Nonetheless, the family persevered and again prospered, providing Ted and his sister, Marnie, with happy childhoods.The influence of Ted's memories of Springfield can be seen throughout his work. Drawings of Horton the Elephant meandering along streams in the Jungle of Nool, for example, mirror the watercourses in Springfield's Forest Park from the period. The fanciful truck driven by Sylvester McMonkey McBean in The Sneetches could well be the Knox tractor that young Ted saw on the streets of Springfield. In addition to its name, Ted's first children's book, And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street, is filled with Springfield imagery, including a look-alike of Mayor Fordis Parker on the reviewing stand, and police officers riding red motorcycles, the traditional color of Springfield's famed Indian Motocycles.Ted left Springfield as a teenager to attend Dartmouth College, where he became editor-in-chief of the Jack-O-Lantern, Dartmouth's humor magazine. Although his tenure as editor ended prematurely when Ted and his friends were caught throwing a drinking party, which was against the prohibition laws and school policy, he continued to contribute to the magazine, signing his work "Seuss." This is the first record of the "Seuss" pseudonym, which was both Ted's middle name and his mother's maiden name.To please his father, who wanted him to be a college professor, Ted went on to Oxford University in England after graduation. However, his academic studies bored him, and he decided to tour Europe instead. Oxford did provide him the opportunity to meet a classmate, Helen Palmer, who not only became his first wife, but also a children's author and book editor.After returning to the United States, Ted began to pursue a career as a cartoonist. The Saturday Evening Post and other publications published some of his early pieces, but the bulk of Ted's activity during his early career was devoted to creating advertising campaigns for Standard Oil, which he did for more than 15 years.As World War II approached, Ted's focus shifted, and he began contributing weekly political cartoons to PM magazine, a liberal publication. Too old for the draft, but wanting to contribute to the war effort, Ted served with Frank Capra's Signal Corps (U.S. Army) making training movies. It was here that he was introduced to the art of animation and developed a series of animated training films featuring a trainee called Private Snafu.While Ted was continuing to contribute to Life, Vanity Fair, Judge and other magazines, Viking Press offered him a contract to illustrate a collection of children's sayings called Boners. Although the book was not a commercial success, the illustrations received great reviews, providing Ted with his first "big break" into children's literature. Getting the first book that he both wrote and illustrated, And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, published, however, required a great degree of persistence - it was rejected 27 times before being published by Vanguard Press.The Cat in the Hat, perhaps the defining book of Ted's career, developed as part of a unique joint venture between Houghton Mifflin (Vanguard Press) and Random House. Houghton Mifflin asked Ted to write and illustrate a children's primer using only 225 "new-reader" vocabulary words. Because he was under contract to Random House, Random House obtained the trade publication rights, and Houghton Mifflin kept the school rights. With the release of The Cat in the Hat, Ted became the definitive children's book author and illustrator.After Ted's first wife died in 1967, Ted married an old friend, Audrey Stone Geisel, who not only influenced his later books, but now guards his legacy as the president of Dr. Seuss Enterprises.At the time of his death on September 24, 1991, Ted had written and illustrated 44 children's books, including such all-time favorites as Green Eggs and Ham, Oh, the Places You'll Go, Fox in Socks, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas. His books had been translated into more than 15 languages. Over 200 million copies had found their way into homes and hearts around the world.Besides the books, his works have provided the source for eleven children's television specials, a Broadway musical and a feature-length motion picture. Other major motion pictures are on the way.His honors included two Academy awards, two Emmy awards, a Peabody award and the Pulitzer Prize.

A lot of you would say I still have a thing for her, but you would be so wrong. I am being completely serious when I say that I would rather be shot than even consider being in the same town with her ever again. Our marriage was on the rocks when she got pregnant and the two years I spent with her after the birth were like hell on earth. I was being truthful when I said I was put off from sex while watching a birth live. I was so messed up, I was worried I would even want to be with anyone’s vagina after I moved out. So I am not in any hurry to find this pic and you know what? I left all those pics on her computer before I left and the thought of looking for a pic of my ex-wife’s vagina with a coconut-sized object trying to push its way out thrills me to no end.

Pure simply means it is not artificial. Pure vanilla extract is made by steeping chopped vanilla beans with ethyl alcohol and water. Manufacturers can use a variety of types and qualities of beans. The process of extraction takes about 48 hours then the mixture is placed in tanks from anywhere from a few days to several weeks. The aged mixture is then filtered, placed in holding tanks and eventually bottled. I was surprised to find out that pure extracts may still contain sugar, corn syrup, colors and stabilizers.

A review of’ 3 Idiots says its makers borrowed only scraps from Chetan Bhagat’s Five Point Someone. “Rajkumar Hirani and co-writer Abhijat Joshi churn out some delectable idiotgiri, laced with juvenile humour and tear-shedding moments,” says the reviewer whose rating of the movie is 3.5 on a scale of 5.

I just did not love this one. I struggled to get through it and debated not finishing it multiple times. There was just too much language and content for me.

Yesterday I did pretty well in the food dept. My usual bagel and cream cheese for breakfast (though I really do need to go get my weight watchers bagels instead of the big white ones I have now), honeydew and cantaloupe for lunch, a small wrap with about 1/8 cup chicken and the rest peppers and onions for supper and some more honeydew for a bedtime snack. Normally I wouldn't have a bedtime snack cause I tend to just mindlessly eat, but this was a planned snack with a set portion and I didn't even want to mindlessly eat afterwards!
For example, in 2006 when I first looked into this issue, I used rates of 6 percent and 5.625 percent on the 30- and 15-year loans. I found that over a 15-year period, the cash flow savings had to yield 7 percent, or 1 percent more than the rate on the 30-year loan, to just offset the higher interest rate on the 30-year loan. This can be termed the break-even return on the cash flows. To come out ahead, the borrower has to earn a return above the break-even return.
I appreciate your help.

And that final (heavy) dusting of powdered sugar really put it over the top.

The IPO market continues to expand with new offerings hitting exchanges on a daily basis. One of the more prominent technology IPOs this week was Pandora Media (P) which priced at $16 and enjoyed a one day pop but since then has deflated precipitously. This has been the fate of several IPOS, including the high profile LinkedIn (LNKD) which has lost about 30% so far. So far this year we’ve had 138 filings and 74 pricings, slightly ahead of 2010. While the renewed interest and activity in the IPO market is indicative of a more risk tolerant investor, it is difficult to disparage it with the monicker of a bubble, especially if we compare it to the 1999 extravaganza.

Wanting to increase the robustness of the world in which I exist is the most selfish and most altruistic way to relate to that world. It is in fact to be in sync with the immanent order of that world, and to value that which has allowed you to value in the first place, namely, robustness.
So. . . if you’re looking for something to do this weekend (right!) and want to give your bookshelves a quick facelift, here are some easy ideas.
I started reading this book several times. I never made it through the birthday party. But this time, I was surprised, how much I liked the writing style and the story. Okay, I will have to admit, I saw the movies first. It is one of my favorite movies. I thought, it was too late to read the book. I already knew the story, I already had pictures of the characters and the settings in my head.

And the ending was fantabulous! A lot like Deathly Hallows. I only have one complaint here--and that is the writing. Not anything on a whole, but there were instances where Kagawa, to describe emotion, would write 'anger flared' and other feelings in the same way and it came off as kind of passive. It just distracted me a bit.
I have written two more books so far in the Star Makers series.

The Real Estate agent took us to the block but was a little confused in locating it. So he unravelled the original Estate drawings. They were in a roll form with two pieces of doweling with the parchment attached at each end. The drawings showed a grand community with a Town Hall, Police Station and Post Office located on a huge roundabout. Behind this civic centre were the recreational fields designed for Football, Cricket and Cycling. On the outer section of the football field was to be a flat cycling velodrome.

Before we start, I’d like to give you a tip on enjoying the book more, if you’re just reading it: Make up your own chapter titles. For example, the first one should be named “How long is your hippo’s esophagus?” It’s fun to do. On with the review.
And a third apparently young user said that “these questions are ridiculous, and impossible for me to answer. I haven’t had a job, a car, or my first kiss yet, making it impossible for me to answer three of the five questions. Now I can’t download anything from iTunes.”
If in any case sharing and possession becomes an issue, and adult must intervene. Gonzalez-Mena (2009) suggests to “reflect the feelings of both parties rather than to discuss issues of fairness” (p.60). Toddlers are just gaining a sense of ownership, so talking about sharing and fairness is too soon. Gonzalez-Mena (2009) also gives another great point: children can not understand the concept of sharing unless they know what possession is (p.60).
I smile with these memories.
She runs through the doorway and can feel air rushing against her skin as she hurls herself along in long strides. Her bruised breasts and body bounce painfully in opposite directions, the soles of her feet slapping noisily against the darkened floor. Despite the obvious signs of moving closer, somehow the woman seems to be receding from her, as if the distance between them is growing instead of shrinking. A sense of dread and foreboding fill her, and she dares to look over her shoulder, only to find her unhappy attendants chasing after her desperately.
This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God’s Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ. In reality, the saved or the “called out” come together in a collective gathering at an appointed time and place.

I have no shame in admitting that I am a fan of Burnside and take a small amount of pride in being one of the voices that has helped convince John Self over at Asylum to read more of him and realise just how good he is (although in his own end of the year round-up he mentions that he did so in order to shut people like me up). This latest novel shows a writer at the height of his powers returning to a story he failed to complete a decade ago and delivering a novel filled with atmosphere, unease, myth, storytelling, artistry and writing so good it sometimes make you want to take a moment and nod your head in appreciation. Set in the Arctic Circle and drawing on the folk myths of the area this is a book infused with the spectral light of the midnight sun; deeply unsettling, wonderfully complex, another weapon in my arsenal to make sure that you all make the effort to pick up one of his books. Soon.

Teen pregnancy is at its lowest level in 40 years. Shouldn't that indicate something?
The external and internal journey are juxtaposed throughout and emotionally she explores the caution, the fear the sense of loss and longing, the feelings engendered by isolation and fellowship. Throughout the book Carroll wrestles with the difference between being a tourist and being a traveller and ultimately resolves this issue. The difference of pace is one thing but there’s much more to it than that.
A woman and a man driver are involved in a horrific collision, but amazingly both escape completely unhurt - though their cars are written off.
Thank you all for hanging in with me. I hope you all have a wonderful Easter. I will be spending the day with my family, both immediate and extended. I'll be at church celebrating and then off to my aunt and uncle's house for food, egg hunts, karaoke, lots of laughter, and then some more food!

But the board to play with the audited casino bonus codes here, does not lose relevance. Large casino (or rather, finance companies, serving them) use a much more serious protection of players (up to store data on servers not connected to the Internet). In addition, there is a risk to get to the casino, which opened specially to collect credit card numbers and money trusting players and disappear.
Jason's device is much more elaborate, and looking kind of steampunkish. He and Antonios and Jim were working all afternoon and evening on a lot of grinding, metal-cutting, and welding tasks, modifying one of the shock-absorber springs and building a delicate, cross-supported throwing arm out of little strips of steel. The in-process result I looked at at the end of the evening was about five-six pounds, I guess. Most of the mass of the device will be in the fulcrum cross-arm and the base of the device, I guess. My machine has most of its mass already - the only thing to be added is the latching mechanism, a detachable pull-stirrup, and another cross-bar.

At two my son was a bruiser. He was more prone to hit you up side the head with a Tonka truck than he was to stroke your cheek. He knew nothing of what it was to “miss” someone and he had been with me all day so there would be no reason to say it, even if he knew what it meant. He was happy when I took him to the crib and happy to lay down for his nap so there was no reason for his chin to tremble with emotion. From that moment on I’ve had a peace in my heart with the knowledge that our loved ones don’t really leave us, they just leave the vehicle we recognize. That was possibly one of the greatest gifts my mother ever gave to me! Thanks Mom!

People love cheesecake. Whether the cheesecake is light and fluffy or dense, is layered with sour cream, topped with fruit, drizzled with caramel or made into chocolate heaven, cheesecake is always a crowd pleaser. There a whole national restaurant chain surrounded around the idea that you WILL have cheesecake for dessert if you eat their. Yet, people are afraid to make them. Ok folks, the secret is out, with a little patience, a rainy evening, a good bottle of wine, and a movie or two you will have a perfect cheesecake. This cheesecake below is my first creation this year with spring flavors. Strawberries picked locally in May and June are given a citrus kick from fresh lemon curd, served with a light and airy vanilla whip cream that seems such a perfect match for summer berries and ice cream sundaes. (And of course my cheesecake).
We got our coals hot, but not as hot as you’d want for burgers or steak. I guess the best way to achieve this is to use less charcoal and spread it evenly on the bottom of the grill after it’s hot. We just bought one of those grill towers that speeds up the burning of the coals and it’s proven to be a good investment so far. For a gas grill, just set it to low.

So many pieces of crumpled paper as my thoughts turn this way and that, not even trying to make sense but the idea of recording something for future use appeals, the thoughts during waking hours I don’t have the time to explore properly, not that clarity always comes, but it might, and what to do with it when it arrives, in what way can I channel my new-found awareness of me.
Even in a nation's history 86 years is a long time. I remember the salient points of the change from British to Scottish. None of them was political. We never got the jail for the Stone. The people cheered us. There was public support for our 'no numeral' campaign when Elizabeth the 'Second' came to the throne. Scotland had had no 'First' Elizabeth. Our coronation souvenirs without the numeral were wildly popular. The newspapers backed us in their news columns but refused to take our paid advertisements. They were feart as they still are.

The well-reviewed animated Western Rango, starring Johnny Depp as a fish-out-of-water chameleon, led the box office on Friday with $9.8 million, according to early estimates. That puts the quirky PG-rated movie on pace for an opening weekend of about $35 million — a solid figure, but well short of industry expectations ranging from $40 million to $50 million. Last year’s How to Train Your Dragon, also a March release, engulfed $12.1 million its first day en route to a $43.7 million debut. Granted, Dragon benefited from those 3-D surcharges, and Paramount is probably wishing right now that Rango sported an extra dimension, too. (Roger Ebert, on the other hand,»

Why did they grumble? Why were they so upset? Because from their perspective they had been cheated. “What’s in it for me” is the governing question (Matthew 19:27 puts this very question on the lips of Peter). My world is centered around me, myself, and I and for me, “What’s in it for me” rules the day.
“It’s disappointing that the talks with the White House did not reach a favorable conclusion, and I appreciate the Speaker insisting on reduced spending and opposing the President’s call for higher taxes on American families and job creators. It is similarly disappointing that the White House has refused to join Republicans in our effort to cut Washington spending now, cap runaway spending in the future and save our entitlement programs and our country from bankruptcy by requiring the nation to balance its budget. Speaker Boehner has informed us that he will work on a new path forward with Leader Reid to develop a solution that will prevent default, without job killing tax hikes, while substantially reducing Washington spending.

Personally, I have mental dilemma with the whole fur coat thing. I understand that way the animals are treated is barbaric.

I have heard of many other residents of similar “age” (3 years) that they are going through the same and that this seems to be a common phase where people either take long breaks, leave or come back under a different account. For me it goes even deeper than that. SL has helped me through a very stressful phase in my life in which I often felt very low and, without noticing it at that point, retracted to this virtual world. It gave me an outlet to be creative, to get the kick of exploring new places and virtual art, to enjoy cheap online retail therapy. It provided me with a constant, the virtual home I am sharing with Fi, which always was peaceful and relaxing, and of course I met amazing people and other creative minds there.
My newfound propensity for listening to the radio whenever and wherever possible was not without its drawbacks, however. In particular, my parents complained that listening to the radio while doing my homework distracted me, causing me to make mistakes. Naturally, I insisted that it was not distracting, that I could do my homework just fine.

May 20 2009 – Belfast South Africa. SAPS Investigation officers made a breakthrough by arresting two suspects for housebreaking and theft at a farm house. It is alleged that the two suspects broke into a farm house and broke the safe with intentions of getting money but with no success. Thereafter they stole all the groceries which they could found inside the house, before stealing some machines out of the garage. The police received a tip-off from one of their informers. This information led to the arrest of the suspects and the recovery of the stolen goods. The suspects are due in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on 20 May 2009.Reported by constable K C Rankwe. http://www.sapsjournalonline.gov.za/dynamic/journal_dynamic.aspx?pageid=414&jid=15328

Take note of happenings around you and learn to read the signs. Many things are changing, many things will be changing and you must adapt and change with them.

Enjoy the ride on the Cosmic roller coaster as it gathers speed towards Earth’s new beginning.

It’s so easy to avoid them according to Tom Mower. Simply chose Sisel Safe products and avoid these products in bottles and personal care formulations.

You may remember a few posts and a few weeks ago I got a new sewing machine - a Pfaff Quilt Expression, and Margaret Atwood's story pretty much sums up my experience. It does amazing things but it is hands down, no holds barred the pickiest sewing machine I've ever met, and I've met a lot! BUT, the silly thing is growing on me. It handles invisible thread flawlessly and does a fantastic job on machine binding. It's alphabets work great. It does sooo may things sooo well, that, well, there's hope that we can learn to co-exist. My 6 word story for this would probably go something like this:
in ragged text setting, make a pleasing rag without large, odd negative shapes; consider alternating long and short lines, that are not too regular, also use minimal hyphenation. avoid more than three hyphenated lines in a row.
RR—Yeah, and I’m also reluctant to try to advocate a system that explains it all, because I think that’s one of the failures of scientific materialism. It wants to reduce everything to formulas. It wants to explain everything in terms of a system. And part of what’s happening with the intuitive side is that you don’t explain it—it just is. You don’t reduce it to a system. You don’t control it.
By then, all seems softer, and the slowness and solitude suddenly just right, for day dreams, for wanderings of the mind, for even tears and laughs, or for no reasons at all.
Could this be the profit of the crisis? That we shall re-discover our humanity? The price is high if the present immigration trend continues. But at least we shall be getting something back.

The beads on the left are Z861 iris yellow over a base of CiM Adobe ltd run and unique Chai 711793-3 (no frit, just silver foil then encased). I have only wrapped one half of each Adobe bead with silver foil but rolled the whole bead in frit. The silver foil has reacted wonderfully with the Adobe where it touches the galss and has fumed the rest of the bead to a lovely toffee shade. I couldn't get The Z861 to do anything faux borroish in the slightest but do love how it looks on this bead.

It isn't so often that a product review comes up that my hubby gets excited about. When I told him he would be getting a free t-shirt in the mail, he was pretty stoked. The shirt that we received to review was the "beer bear deer" shirt. We were a little slow on the up take ( see image below ).

Just this morning Jason and I were marveling at the fact that once we do have kids, there is no “going back”. Right now we have the pleasure of enjoying each others’ company. Once we have kids, that dynamic will not go away, but it will be different. Once you’re a parent you never stop being a parent – whether you’re 20, 40, or 60. What an incredible blessing and responsibility that is! And at times, what a burden. That’s where we come in.

But that’s not all. He also stated that “There is no such thing as global warming.” He is also a creationist who believes it should be taught in schools as well as why evolution is wrong. “What we should be teaching are the problems and holes and I think there are legitimate problems and holes in the theory of evolution.”

After all this time of never having touched the seedlings and only once being told not to lick the condensation off the lid to the little mini green house I created she decides to play in the dirt! I don’t recall reading about what to do if your kid pulls up your seedlings. We/I ended up doing an emergency pea transplant. Those peas are actually looking perkier in their new home while the herbs are languishing but I’m still holding out hope.

Rise Against – Ready to Fall
The ShankRabbit and Isabella (and Peanut) household will be expecting a new addition in April. A boy. We had a rough first few months with morning sickness and some medical issues, but all is well now. He is doing what he's supposed to be doing and even measuring a little on the big side - lawd help me! Peanut was adamant that this baby was a girl for so long, but now she is pretty excited to have a little brother. We are still working on names. Her suggestions so far are Baby Johnson (that was originally the girl's name choice for her), Echo, and Uncle. As you can see, not much to go on so far.

Everyone was joking that I had a date. My friend Anita Gordon, who writes as Kathleen Kirkwood wanted something to eat and paid for me because to thank me for helping her out.
The darned birds had of course figured out a long time ago that the café was a splendid place to get a free meal, took a loop above DH and I. Just as I was about to tuck into my salad, a very unwelcome greeting ended up on my plate and that was it. Brrrr! Will make sure to sit under a parasol next time we decide to enjoy an outdoor lunch!

One of my favourite TV series scores this one. Portrays Vulcan as a brutal planet – quite a surprise considering what we knew of Spock’s character. The fight music on this soundtrack is a highlight of Star Trek‘s musical legacy.
One of my fellow attendees came over, welcomed me again and told me a few more things about DA and the meetings.
I moved a little, just to see what he’d do. He calmly sat down my phone back in its case and ran his finger down my nose. I opened my eyes and looked up at him, desperately wanting to ask and yet terrified of the answer. What would I do if he had been doing what I’d thought he had? Would that be break-up worthy? Would I give him a second chance? Would I ever be able to trust him again?
But so anyway: what I’m getting from the Alabama Shakes, and from JD McPherson (about whom more below), is that Boys and Girls is ultimately hugely innocent—and I don’t mean that as a criticism. They sound like four people who dig the shit out making music together, and the album sounds exactly like that, song after song: like celebrations, each track. I don’t want to dwell on what that says about the music business and scene that that’d be so rare as to be worth celebrating, but there it is: Boys and Girls by the Alabama Shakes sounds as pure and innocent and fun a record as any I can think of from the last decade. It’s put-it-on-and-do-yardwork music, and it’s have-three-beers-and-finish-the-night music, and it’s, for me, been every-minute music for the last good while. You’re missing more than you can imagine if you’re missing this.
I've been reading (and enjoying) Satoshi Kanazawa's just-published book, The Intelligence Paradox: Why the Intelligent Choice Isn't Always the Smart One. While I plan to write more about it, just now I want to discuss one item that I disagree with. That is the idea of female choice in sexuality.
I’m only making one resolution this year: to be better about blogs. I want to blog more regularly. But, I recognise this is a two-way street. I also want to do better about reading my friends blogs.
A few of the things I have been busy with this week:
Classy yet trashy, whatever I’ve been labeled
I had 18 Book Doctor sessions over the 2 days. Obviously, and as one would expect, there was a range of genres and also of potential in those submissions. But everyone felt they learned something really useful and specific to their own writing, including the effectiveness of their concept and pitch.
Jaden is excited to spend the summer at Eye on Tomorrow, the exclusive summer science camp that her father has founded. But are her father’s intentions purely noble? He has made a fortune creating Placid Meadows, a StormSafe community that no tornado can touch.

Based on my personal experience with Islam, the “emancipation” expressed by Houda and her school in the film – that of women working & learning, distinguishing between culture & religion – is nothing new at home. Even if we take Singapore out of the picture, Malaysia & Indonesia are both progressive Muslim democracies where women have Real Actual Rights. (Actually, women in general do have rights in the Muslim world, but it always makes a better story to paint us as poor oppressed beings in need of liberation.)

Keep whisking continuously till the mixture becomes a bit thick. This happens because the eggs have begun to cook slightly.
Teaching, because I’m a teacher. Writing, because most writers have to rant about the process at one point or another. Food, because, I like to eat, cook and have plenty of opinions about restaurants. Movies and theater and museums. My family.
The 7th or crown chakra (physiologically) is connected …”to the brain stem, the spinal cord, the nervous system and the pineal gland”. Pg 207 This area when awakened and balanced allows us to be at peace and to feel a “knowing” that we are all interconnected, that things will work out. This is the “knowing” chakra. It is from here that we can develop great compassion for others and ourselves, that we become giving, without wanting something in return.

I used my fave all time baby set from Verve, To the Moon and paired it with some fun MME Miss Caroline "Dilly Dally" papers. Jack and Moe (the bears) were colored with Copics and cut out. I cut along their arms so I could "hang" them over the frame and the plaid flag. The kite was tied to Jack's arm using twine. The sentiment is actually just "Oh Boy" To get the "Boy" on top, I simply masked the sentiment with scotch tape so I could stamp Boy....giving me "Boy Oh Boy." Fitting for twins, dontcha think? Some machine stitching a few adhesive gems finish the card!

I’ve noticed recently that my internet is angry. Really angry. Over the past few weeks, I have been linked again and again to things said by a certain person trying (and possibly succeeding) to be famous on the internet. Heather Clouse.
The next thing I know is the back of my car is hit and I'm forced off the road. Fortunately the speed is only about 20mph at this point, and therefore my life is saved. And my car is playing ten pin bowling with foot high wooden posts as my out of control car ploughs through them.

The tone is striking, even unique (though it does at times resemble a lighter, fruitier version of the Jones books). Within its seemingly gentle form, it takes risks: a quality I value increasingly above others. What this means is that Nourishment could never be mistaken, or muddled in the memory, for any other book. It succeeds because it is quite unlike anything I’ve read before, and I loved it for that.
I plan on blogging regularly again. I really missed it, but I too busy with my new classroom. I'm finally at a point where things have settled down, and I now have time in the evening to write and blog.
And a few more miles down the highway, we saw some bison. Barley gave them only a glance, but Sydney was beside herself... she had never seen anything like them!
I didn't eat a whole lot of enchiladas growing up, but my Nana would make them and they were always a treat. Most often she made them from shredded roasted or boiled chicken, a nice thin and spicy red sauce, and a little cheese. They were always served with the best rice and beans imaginable.
The awesome thing was two of the book fairs were tied to a Reach for the Stars!! reading incentive program that rewards kids for reading. We have received so many "thank yous" and success stories from students, parents and teachers at the those schools. It is an amazing feeling being able to help kids discover the joy of reading and become better readers.

So, I began searching for some options and found this great idea for using canvas drop cloths to make curtains. Much cheaper than Pottery Barn and even cheaper than buying the fabric and making the curtains from scratch.
I remember spending countless hours in college listening to experts give their spiel on how to be as successful as them. And, I even remember the names of a few of the more memorable ones and, if I look deep enough, I still have a few of their business cards.

About Altran
The adoption took longer than I thought. I was worried and stressed about Patric's health and about his handling the changes, what the stress would do to his body. Johanne would reassure me, "Holly, he's not going to die".
I just drank a bottle of Minute Maid Pulpy. They say it’s got ‘no preservatives added’. Aw, c’mon…It’s bottled juice. Is that even possible? So I thought maybe... I'll drink some more Minute Maid Pulpy. I would enjoy this as much as I can since I know that it has no preservatives added.

This is how things go at our house. Usually, I wake up way before SH does, mostly because I go to bed before he does but also because the sun and the cats affect me but do not affect him. The man could sleep through an atom bomb, I think. The desperate cries of a hungry or at least a demanding cat fall on his deaf ears, but penetrate two doors and my earplugs.

Although we continue to socialize her, Sydney is often unfriendly to other people and will sometimes bark and look ferocious when we cross paths with others. But if the other person is unafraid and just walks up to her, Sydney backs down and becomes their friend. Several people in our caravan group have taken this approach, including Roger, Spike, and Debbie. Still, we're careful with her around other people, particularly children.
Tell her no …
The past week has been difficult. The Lord asked us to pray seriously about something that is so scary to us. Satan has definetly been on the attack and we are just asking God to send us clarity. I didn't think that I was so stressed out until the entire last week I have been waking in the middle of the night/early morning and can't sleep. Nothing like good 'ol insomnia to make you say Lord what are you trying to tell me. Thank God last night I was finally able to get some sleep. I know God is taking us on a long journey and I know I am not patient but I know God has told me to be still and wait!

It was while reading this that the presence of God came over me in a swift moment, I felt as though I could but reach out and my hand would touch the hem of His robe. I called out to Him in this moment of belief that He would show Himself for my physical eyes to behold His glory, but He did not. Instead of waiting on Him I began to ask Him for all the things that I desired knowing that if I were to ask without doubting I would receive and I did not want this moment of pure belief to pass by me (James 1). As the words rushed from my mouth into demands of all sizes and colors I felt the presence of God leave my room and was left to the silence of confusion, deeply troubled with why He had gone away.
I should be happy for my family members and friends who have just gotten pregnant or have just had a baby, but it's hard to smile. And I feel like shit because of that.

Broadband comes empowered with high bandwidth that is useful in downloading large amount of information within a short period of time. It makes browsing of web pages with all graphics and flash player presentations much faster than ever before. Faster broadband connections can make a huge difference, when it comes to downloading music, videos, movies, software and security updates. You can download a DVD quality movie or a huge software update within a few minutes. You can listen, watch or download music and video just by visiting online music web sites or VoD services. For example, mp3.com or online radio channels offer you streaming music in CD quality or you may just purchase your favorite music from online iTunes stores as possibilities are wide open with broadband. It is not just that, as Video on Demand and IPTV services come out with videos that you can watch in full screen mode just like your home TV or just you can download the contents for viewing later.
Too bad Dawn wasn't doing a video of me trying to get out of that but and we had to figure a way to give me the leverage to do that. Finally I did manage to get out with the help of Dawn and Mike and they immediately left the room by different doors laughing all the way. I was fully dressed, just had to see if I could do it by myself. NOT yet anyway.

We have 2 "fobs" that start our car. One wasn't working - it registered a "fob not found" error. The dealer - MacIver Dodge in Newmarket, Ontario - informed hubby that they had never heard of such a problem (I guess they haven't heard of a little thing called The Internet, where a quick search certainly shows that the problem DOES exist). When the problem continued and hubby called back they said to bring it in, they'd put it on the computer and see what the problem was. He took in both fobs tonight (as per their request) - THEY LOST MINE! They lost it, then said ... oh, did you give us 2??? !!! This isn't the first time their service has been less than stellar - I think I'm going to have to give them their own tag and start keeping track of the problems - I do hope they call and ask our opinion of their customer service, as I definitely have an opinion about THAT!
Again, ‘racial tension’ doesn’t need ‘stirring up’ – it already is stirred up! But not quite. It isn’t racial tension that’s the problem; but Muslim-non-Muslim relations. Oldham has a problem with this divide which it shares with nearly all north-western cities and towns. And Muslim self-ghetto-isation, again, is the main cause of these problems.

With the light came Verity and with Verity came hope. We met in a lousy café on the Goldhawk Road and over scalding coffee and and endless chain of cigarettes I went through what had happened. Verity asked me loads of questions. She was especially interested in the needle and how old it was. From pure calculation we was able to be sure the needle wasn't used in the last twenty four hours and was probably much older. Verity told me that the chances of me being infected was very very slight (for HIV at least). She said there was a bigger chance I could have contracted hepatitis C but even that was quite doubtful. She asked how long ago it happened and I told her five months. “Well, you need to get tested... it's the only way to be sure. It'd show up now if you've caught anything.”

The Irish are famed worldwide for our stern drinking abilities, we are hailed and often times mocked for our capabilities to handle the odd drink or two, but is this something to be proud of? Homeland of the black stuff and more than likely a few alcoholics, Ireland is inevitably a land of excess. By no means am I preaching to give it up, just revise and be wise before you enter your latest boose filled night on the town. The Irish do love to drink but our famed party culture is no excuse to develop unhealthy drinking habits!
The TLS Books of the Year edition often involves an awful lot of skimming over non-fiction books you haven't the faintest interest in, lots of academics and critics chummily gushing about books written by their academic and critical friends and usually consensus about a book or two which you were already well aware of. Or is that just me? Anyway, this year under the dependable name of translator Michael Hofmann was a slim American novel published by Louisiana State University Press. Two things to prick the ears up there: Hofmann first (and recommending an American novel rather than something in translation) and then the publisher. LSU Press were of course the people to originally print John Kennedy O'Toole's Pulitzer Prize-winning tour de force A Confederacy Of Dunces. This is a press willing to take a risk or two. Seeing also that the author of Hofman's recommendation was Chris Bachelder, whose name I recognised from my McSweeney's-reading past, and that the subject of this book was a father's musings whilst his wife is in the third trimester of their second pregnancy, I was busy hunting down a copy before I'd finished the paragraph.

If you’re looking for a completely bonkers, unusually artsy experience well then look no further than Patrick Smith of Vector Park and his odd-ball game of Windosill. The game look like it came out of a child’s nursery, if it was the nursery of a famous artist of course. My point is this game will be odd, I’m certain of it – but after playing the demo I’m completely intrigued. There are a couple of issues I have with the game that limit it’s accessibility, but overall it’s grand.

I started blogging a few weeks ago after gentle nudging from a friend who is a profoundly talented creative writer. She once told me “if you can write like you talk, and you start blogging, I would totally read it.” And later, “if you accidentally kill someone while working as a nurse, you could have a successful second career as a humor writer.” Having options is important to me, but writing isn’t just a back up plan to be relied upon if an involuntary homicide occurs.

Speaking of David Niven, somebody really must have been inspired when they decided to pair him with Ginger. I can't get enough of the way they worked together on this movie. It looks like they aren't trying at all; just having fun, which, according to Ginger's book, they were. One of my favorite scenes is when Polly comes home from the dance contest and finds David waiting for her - with the baby. The talents of both Ginger and David are used magnificently in this scene: David's speech and impression of her dancing and then Polly telling him about "the father" crack me up every time.
