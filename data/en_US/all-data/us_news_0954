But the anti-impetuous Hal Steinbrenner runs the Yankees these days, so Girardi is safe. Nevertheless, Girardi knows a three-game losing streak to begin the year looks and feels different than a 40-20 team falling to 40-23.

At issue is whether the global warming money is a "fee" or a "tax" that can be spent on the rail project, or whether 30 years of case law and ballot measures dating back to Proposition 13 forbid it. Critics said the Brown administration knows the issue is likely to be tied up in court for years and is simply trying to keep the project alive long enough to start construction.

He was never able to develop that connection."
So what do I think will happen? Here's my guess. I suspect that the rapidly weakening housing market will soon force households to reverse recent trends, and start saving more of their income. That, along with reduced investment spending, will help improve the U.S.'s underlying savings/investment imbalance. It will also cause a period of sluggish growth (perhaps outright recession), but that will have the effect of reducing the expected returns on dollar assets, finally driving the value of the dollar down in a serious way. That in turn will help make exports more competitive and imports more expensive, facilitating the badly-needed improvement in the U.S. trade balance. This doesn't have to be a disastrous series of events. But as I mentioned above, there is a real possibility that a significant dollar decline could turn into a rout, which could turn this slightly depressing but relatively benign scenario into a financial crisis.

Caddy's on the Beach: While Woody's lacks an actual beach, Caddy's has plenty of sandy space. It's got ramshackley charm - sunsets, volleyball, kids building sand castles, all accompanied by a set-list of beachy cover-band greatest hits. The picnic tabletops are sticky, it takes a while for a server to notice you've ambled up, and if you overstay (1 1/2 hours maximum for diners) they suggest you move to the beach chairs down the way. The upside is that eating a chili cheese dog and sipping cold draft beer from a plastic cup is seldom as enjoyable as it is on this stretch of Sunset Beach. The house corned beef and brisket make for laudably tasty sandwich innards; the half-pound burger is juicy and nicely seasoned. The menu leans much more heavily to meaty barbecue than seafood. 9000 W Gulf Blvd., Sunset Beach, Treasure Island. (727) 360-4993.

Still, Social Security can work — as long as it finds more and more workers to support the growing number of retirees. But it can't do that because the system encourages people, who once relied on their children and savings to help them through old age, to have fewer children.

After a series of summer blockbusters that individually introduced Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, all these Marvel comics characters come together to save the world. Director and cowriter Joss Whedon pulls off the tricky feat of juggling a large ensemble cast (Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth) and giving each actor a chance to shine.

“I’ve seen that it’s a business from the start. Coming into the league, Sam (Madison), all of those guys told me it’s a business so the front office is going to take care of themselves and we as players have to take care of ourselves.

* I like the Rams' hiring of Les Snead as GM for a simple reason: as personnel director he had a good record of finding players for the Atlanta Falcons. And that's what the Rams need more than anything. Players. Lots and lots of quality players.

Frankly, this seems do-able. Many homes in this area are owned by elderly residents who bought them in Mount Pleasant's heyday -- 40 years ago or more -- before foreclosure, crime and blight swept through. Few of these homeowners are likely to recoup their investment.

Perhaps it was that raw vision of the state park as a cesspool that swayed the Highway Commission. Three years later, it got serious about building bathrooms.

With the Juice Pack Plus, there's no need to map out the closest power outlets for charging your smart phone because the combo battery-case more than doubles your stored power. A toggle switch allows you to choose either standby mode, where the phone's battery is used first, or charging mode, where the Juice Pack battery is used first. The hard case also includes a shockproof rubberized band for those unfortunate butterfinger moments. And the case itself is easy to slide on and off the phone, and you don't have to remove it in order to sync to iTunes.

If she'd stopped recording, her tabloid tendencies would have consumed her legacy. Thank heaven - and despite several assurances of retirement - Sinead O'Connor, 45, has soldiered on, dropping the occasional album to pierce the veil of her headline-making habits and remind everyone that, OK, she's a little off but she's also one of the most admirably soul-baring, undeniably gut-wrenching pop artists around.

The lack of disclosure prevents voters from knowing who wields influence within a presidential campaign. Keeping their identities secret could end up stinging Romney — like the mishandled release of his income-tax returns — if voters conclude he is withholding politically damaging information.
Although recent disclosures that in 2007 the New York Police Department spied on Muslims in New Jersey have unleashed a furor, interviews with a dozen former state and federal officials show the department's presence here was widely known among the state's law enforcement officials.

The bagel doesn't much resemble a musical instrument, but the folks at Jazzy Bagels, in historic downtown Gresham, know how to riff on good dough. The cozy breakfast and lunch spot is a staple for folks in east county who want high-quality bagels, big sandwiches, hot coffee drinks, friendly service and a dose of jazz music. The name is derived from Gresham's long association with the Mt. Hood Jazz Festival, and the shop, with a baby grand piano in the center of the room, has been a satellite venue for the festival in the past and still hosts music once a week.

Outlook: One of the longest winning streaks in the nation will end when the top two teams in the ESPN High School Fab 50 meet in the marquee game of the inaugural Maryland-New York Challenge at St. Paul's. McDonogh, the No. 1 team the ESPN poll, has won 60 in a row and No. 2 Garden City has won 54 straight. Chapman, who has taken her team to Maryland to play in Mount Hebron's tournament in years past, acknowledges it can be tough to scout teams from so far away. But there won't be too many secrets considering how high-profile these programs have become. "We know they're skilled in every position and have great depth," Chapman said. "They're a well-oiled machine." Garden City has weapons of its own, as each of the players mentioned above are headed to play at Division I schools. This weekend's two-day tournament is their chance to show that they — and their state — belong on top. "I think it's an incredible opportunity to play the caliber of teams that are down there," Chapman said. "It's not an opportunity you get every day to play this level of competition."

A number of studies have proved the value of quality early childhood education, particularly in savings on special education, remedial job training, correctional facilities and other costs that are a drain on economic growth. The returns on a modest investment in high-quality school readiness initiatives -- estimated at as much as $16 in long-term savings for every $1 spent, according to a cost-benefit analysis of the Perry preschool study -- are significant and long lasting. Children entering kindergarten ready to learn are more likely to graduate from high school and move on to postsecondary education. The benefits of a well-educated work force include higher salaries and greater economic stability. Furthermore, if more students finished school and had a better skill set, we may not have the stubborn unemployment rate that plagues our economy.
County Executive Ken Ulman included $366,500 in his $899 million budget to fight homelessness.

There are some engaging scenes at the outset as Doug wobbles onto the ice in his first set of skates — figure skates. His flirtation with a hockey groupie (Allison Pill) looks as if it might have a wistful Rocky and Adrian sweetness. His teammates, including a pair of jabbering magpie Russians, the boozy, divorced captain and bombastic, black-hearted coach, promise to develop into a colorful squad of background players. None of it pans out. The romance is forced, the girl shrivels into a misogynist fantasy, the teammates are one-note numbskulls, and the film strains to wring ever-diminishing chuckles from Doug's punishing on-ice clashes.

It's not sustainable economically because when most of the gains from productivity growth go to people at the top, the vast middle class doesn't have the purchasing power to buy the goods and services an ever-more productive economy can generate. The result is chronically inadequate demand for goods and services. That's meant anemic growth punctuated by recessions.

Former Lions coach Steve Mariucci, also an analyst with NFL Network, doesnt expect Claiborne, a probable top-seven pick, Gilmore nor Kirkpatrick to fall to the Lions at 23, either.

Although the Internet has killed its classified advertising, the BAR hasn't succumbed to the economy and the iPad like so many mainstream papers, in part because its display advertisers have remained loyal, as predominantly gay business owners want to reach customers who prefer gay doctors, therapists and bookstores.

This slender woman has engaged this land and environment with intimacy, passion -- and patience. The couple have lived in the modest house they built since 1989 but did not begin to garden until seven years later. Sarkissian walked the land, watched the light, observed wildlife, learned about native plants and water harvesting, revived their clay fill soil ("the worst," she says), and took in what it means to live with threats of fire and flood.
"They’re making great ecological choices," she said.
Thirdly, I’ve always been a devout follower of my step-mother’s style mantra: things should go, not match. I don’t think there’s a dress in the universe that I would want to see five people wearing at once.

The way the Nets see it, the rivalry isn’t ending. They’ll still be the Nets, after all – albeit the Brooklyn Nets – and the teams will merely be crossing the East River to play each other from now on, instead of the Hudson River. Their focus is on the future, not the past.

I would love to make the team and actually do something at the Olympics."

No, I mean what guidebooks to stuff in your backpack. There's no point in going if you don't know what you're seeing and its layers of history, and I've been known to lug pounds of paper over the Thames, up the Alps and into the Vatican.
Q: What surprises the people who come for the mountaineering stories? A: A lot of people just don't understand the disease — that you might choke to death because your brain confuses swallowing with breathing.

Why he's a fit: Martin might have been a top-10 pick had he stayed another year at Stanford. As it is, he's a tackle with upside who comes from a pro-style offense and is very bright. If football wasn't in the picture, he likely would have gone to Harvard. With the Lions, he'd probably take a redshirt year to get stronger before stepping into the starting lineup.

The ramped-up construction schedule is a no-brainer. Bids are coming in to DOT at 25 percent under budget. And road-builders say every $1 billion spent creates 35,000 "direct and indirect" jobs. (Of course, that didn't stop lawmakers from diverting dollars away from transportation last session, while Scott deep-sixed the $2.7 billion high-speed rail project that would have created thousands more jobs.)

To reduce barriers to growth and investment, I’ve ordered a review of government regulations. When we find rules that put an unnecessary burden on businesses, we will fix them. But I will not hesitate to create or enforce commonsense safeguards to protect the American people. That’s what we’ve done in this country for more than a century. It’s why our food is safe to eat, our water is safe to drink, and our air is safe to breathe. It’s why we have speed limits and child labor laws. It’s why last year, we put in place consumer protections against hidden fees and penalties by credit card companies, and new rules to prevent another financial crisis. And it’s why we passed reform that finally prevents the health insurance industry from exploiting patients.

Most board members today agreed they want to be sure that the universities, even with more independence, continue to collaborate for the benefit of students. Board member Matthew Donegan of Portland said he wanted to see collaboration focused on "targeted" student outcomes, such as higher graduation rates.

But, aside from our personal insecurities, the nation's lack of knowledge threatens us all. A democracy runs badly when the electorate is dumb as a stick, ignorant of our national heritage, foggy on geography, and culturally illiterate, if you don't count widespread knowledge of the Kardashians and the regulars on "Jersey Shore." Education has been narrowed, dumbed down and redirected, with primary interest in producing a testable and marginally employable workforce. What our schools have not been doing, however, is educating citizens to be fully aware participants in a democratic society. And, all too often, the stultifying effort to wed learning to testing has managed to kill off the natural curiosity most kids bring with them when they enter elementary school. Not only do we turn them out without a solid body of knowledge, but we effectively purge them of the desire to acquire more knowledge on their own.

Part of the problem is a lack of specificity. Only in some areas of the review (such as acquisitions reform or aid for wounded warriors) are clear goals set, with definable targets. Yet, having specific metrics is crucial for the document to have any sort of staying power. If a problem area is important enough to mention in America's primary defense policy document, then we should identify and commit to actual targeted goals to face it.

Jacqueline has a sit-down with Ashley, asking her why she went after Danielle when Jacqueline expressly told her to stay out of it and "to let the grown-ups handle it." Well, that's your answer. There are no grown-ups here. Ashley goes on the offensive, asking why she's making Danielle out to be the saint and Ashley the bad guy. Ashley says she has "every right" to attack Danielle if she thought Danielle hit her mom. (When did the Supreme Court rule on the "mom may have been smacked" as a mitigating factor for assault?) Whatever, Ashley says.

A: Dead branches can be pruned any time of the year. Inner branches can be pruned now or you can wait until fruit sets and then prune in the areas where there isn't fruit. Lower branches should be left on the tree as long as they don't touch the ground. They will also help protect the trunk from sunburning. The trunk and exposed branches can be painted with white latex paint to prevent any sunburn. Remember that fruit sets on new growth, and if you prune too much around the outside of the tree, the amount of fruit produced will be affected.
