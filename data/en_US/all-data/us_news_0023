"It's a little hard to say," Veirs says. "If you took an African child in Mali who heard music of that area and brought them to the States in a different cultural context, would they forget the original music or go forward with that in their heart? My impression is that the first music goes in and informs and makes an impression. There's so much to be learned through music at a young age. I watch my child, at 2, learning rhythm and words. He can say, ‘Mexico,' because we sing ‘Jamaica Farewell' to him - ‘I've been from Maine to Mexico' - and he always jumps in to say, ‘Mexico!' "

The strategy didn't work even if many of Bryant's field goals came on deep jumpers. But they were good looks for Bryant because, well, he's Kobe, and he created enough space off efficient jabs and pump fakes.

On another play, Bryant pump-faked, drew a foul on Arron Afflalo and sank a 16-footer that bounced off the rim and dropped through the net. Bryant also attacked aggressively in the post.

In the play, one of the conspiring reporters works for the Rocky Mountain News, though no evidence exists that the paper played any part in the scheme. But doing so allows Suh to exploit one of the longest newspaper rivalries in history, ending with the News' closure in 2009. You needn't have been alive in 1907 to know how intensely these papers feuded. But that year, Bonfils' enmity for News owner Thomas Patterson spilled out into the streets near the state Capitol. In the spirit of a Wild West duel, Bonfils attacked Patterson, who had called Bonfils a blackmailer in a News cartoon. When the teetering News was bought by Cincinnati media company Scripps-Howard and merged with The Express in 1926, Roy Howard spit, "We believe that a dictatorship of Denver's newspaper field by The Denver Post would be nothing less than a blight."

Designers Charlie Groppetti and Todd Smith grew up in the country and have happy memories of their childhood homes and a simpler life.

Brown's responses to the Sun-Times candidate questionnaire were brief. He "strongly opposes" SB512 because it might result in reduced pension benefits for current state workers, and he advocates allowing the temporary income tax increase to expire in 2014.

Desserts (all $7) provide slightly creative twists on many classics. Panna cotta tastes lightly of orange and comes with a creamy custard thinly spread underneath. It's OK, if a bit dense. When we ordered zabaglione, I expected a frothy, slightly boozy custard, which is usually made with eggs and Marsala, but instead got what tasted like tiramisu filling. It was light, rich and good, especially with the ripe strawberries, but it wasn't zabaglione.

The Auxiliary of Slovenian Workmen's Home, 15335 Waterloo Road, in Cleveland, has been holding a fish fry 49 Fridays of the year for over 30 years. They started holding the fish fry in the public bar on the first floor of the building. The dinners were cooked in the lower level, and the waitresses would run up and down the stairs placing and delivering their orders and never out of breath. What a workout they got. . . .

These volunteers are truly dedicated in preserving the Slovenian heritage at the Slovenian Workmen's Home.-- Pat Nevar, Euclid

City officials and the visitor's bureau have been trying for decades to create an entertainment area to bring tax dollars and a sense of identity to the city. The closest they came was in the 1990s when a developer planned a Universal Studios-type project next to Great America, though it never came to fruition. They also courted the Oakland A's and San Francisco Giants for new ballparks, to no avail. But the city thinks it's finally reeled in its superstar.

Lobbyists and private contractors profit from this arms race.

In the past, we too often defined our relationship with Pakistan narrowly. Those days are over. Moving forward, we are committed to a partnership with Pakistan that is built on a foundation of mutual interests, mutual respect, and mutual trust. We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries, and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe-haven for terrorists whose location is known, and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting. And going forward, the Pakistani people must know: America will remain a strong supporter of Pakistan's security and prosperity long after the guns have fallen silent, so that the great potential of its people can be unleashed.

You'll find that pain isn't running you over. --Movement also reduces pain sensitivity. Water exercises or gentle yoga can help stop your whole body from becoming a pulsing pain generator.

He could be a regular for the Cardinals if Pujols' jumps town. He could be on the bench if Pujols returns. He could be traded if the right offer comes along and the Cardinals want to pounce on a starting shortstop, for example.

Last year, “Love and Other Drugs” played it for both satire and tragedy, giving the boy a hot-shot big pharma job and the girl an incurable disease.
Berkman required less than 30 minutes after entering camp last February to make those around him feel comfortable. However, the longtime Houston Astro needed to reaffirm to himself that he retained the production that has made him a six-time All-Star. Knee surgery sabotaged his 2010 season, leaving him to sign a one-year, $8 million deal that many within baseball thought a lapse of judgment by the Cardinals.

I don't remember who we played but it was late summer of 2007. I got free box seats from a customer at work and ended up going with a buddy who had started going to matches earlier in the season. If you've never sat in the boxes before - don't waste your time. We sat in the box for the first half but felt very isolated. The Timbers, if I remember correctly, had a significant lead at the half and the Timbers Army was hopping. We moved down close at halftime, probably section 109 or so.

This dazzling adaptation of Philip Pullman's fantasy novel proves that Oscar-winning visual effects aren't enough. By playing it safe and cutting the controversial anti-Christian elements, the producers disappointed the novel's fans. The sanitized story about a girl facing grown-up problems in a parallel world with talking animals might have scored with younger audiences, if not for the PG-13 rating. Will young Lyra Belacqua return in the planned sequel, "The Subtle Knife"? "Compass" cost $180 million and made $70 million. Do the math. 113 minutes. A two-disc version has tons of extras.

The $3.5 trillion spending plan the House budget chairman released Tuesday morning is a great deal like what Mr. Ryan and his tea-party-endorsed colleagues in the House offered last year — with a bit less detail in areas that got him and his party in so much trouble last year, like cuts in Medicare benefits for senior citizens.
Rice is just too smart and too difficult to handle when he's matched up on a linebacker, and if you put a cornerback on him and Rice catches it, a corner is typically going to have a hard time tackling him. Rice even works well as a decoy too. The Ravens called a play in the first quarter where Rice was split out wide and the Jets sent a defensive back with him. Flacco looked Rice's way, then zipped the ball over the middle to Ed Dickson for a first down.

There were so many things that were great about playing football at Maryland. A lot of people would assume that getting to play in a big stadium and play on TV was cool, and that was cool. But I think the biggest thing was every day, walking into that locker room and having the camaraderie and the brotherhood around you, knowing 100 guys were going out and putting the same uniform on and working toward a goal and representing the state of Maryland. I’m from Pennsylvania, but it was my dream to play football at Maryland since fifth grade. Every day of the last five years, I remembered that. I remember telling my dad that I was going to play there and him just kind of shrugging it off. Knowing that I was living my dream from age 18 to 22, it was a dream come true. The best part of it was being able to put that jersey and helmet on every day.

"Monster House" was shot with the same motion-capture process that was used in Mr. Zemeckis's "Polar Express," a process I didn't like then and don't like now, even though advancements have been made in its area of obvious weakness, immobile faces. "Monster House" benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting, but the script is nothing to write home about. It focuses on three neighborhood kids, reminiscent of the trio in "Harry Potter," who dare to penetrate the house in an effort to tame it. By the time they've survived a succession of standard-brand terrors done with visual flair, they understand what every homeowner already knows -- a house can eat you alive.

A. Early October rains may have caused new sod to suffer root rot problems. Reduce waterings to only when the soil and turf begin to dry, which should be about once a week. If you haven't by now, apply a fungicide to prevent further decline. A number of products are available at local garden centers. Also, apply a starter fertilizer for new lawns available at your garden center following label instructions. These usually contain the three major nutrients needed for good root growth and disease resistance. This should feed your lawn until late winter, when the first-of- the-year fertilizer is applied at the end of February or early March.

Answer: Watering is the harder part of it. Containers dry out more rapidly. If you're not going to be hand watering, (a container) should have its own irrigation valve. The second most important thing is more frequent fertilization than the typical garden. The nutrients are flushing through the root zone more rapidly, and the plant is not getting as much of them.

Regarding Annulments Under Scrutiny and the Letter to the Editor in Sunday's Post, I wish to offer some thoughts from the other side. I was married to a Catholic for almost 20 years; the marriage ended in divorce. I have been married to a non-Catholic for over 30 years, during which time he has attended Sunday Mass with me every week, educated my two sons at St. Louis U. High, and, when one of them indicated a desire to attend St. Louis University, he sent him there. Last Fall, he travelled with me 350 miles to see my granddaughter (whom he definitely considers his as well as mine) make her first Reconciliation. We both had to go through an agonizing application for annulments (yes, he had to do this also even though he is not Catholic). My undying admiration for his submitting himself to this ranks right up there with educating my children and raising them and being by my side every Sunday at Mass.

Sure, you can take to the river or cruise on up to Tahoe to soak up the unofficial end of summer. But wouldn't you rather spend a few days walking the dusty streets of Old Sac, circa 1850, dodging mock gun battles, grooving to banjo ditties, listening to one of the 22,000 Mark Twain impersonators in the U.S., and raising a fist at the women's suffrage rally?

And finally, there was a weird moment in the pregame: all of the defensive starters were announced and then LB Greg Jones comes walking out of the tunnel.

I like where NetZero is going with this idea. High-speed USB sticks and portable hot spots have been around for years, eliminating the need to hunt for good Wi-Fi or to stay in one place with a fast connection.

In "Prague Winter," her compelling new memoir, former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright emphasizes the importance of leadership -- or its lack -- in world affairs. As a woman, she is the Czechoslovakian-born daughter of Josef Korbel and Anna Spiegelova. As a diplomat, she is a daughter of Munich, the infamous agreement that turned part of her country over to Nazi Germany. She rebuts Tolstoy, "who argued that scholars routinely exaggerate the ability of the great and powerful to control events," by citing the weak and vacillating leaders who failed to recognize evil and stand up to Hitler. They were accessories before the fact, changing history by inaction.
"It doesn't matter," she says. "I don't think they have any advantage." The only concession to their blindness is that all matches start with competitors holding opponents' lapels.

Renck's take: At 27, Kemp is entering his prime. The Dodgers signed him to an eight-year, $160 million deal in November, which looks like a Blue Light Special when compared with the money Cincinnati gave to Joey Votto. Everything is falling into place for the Dodgers. Their new ownership group is ready to unlock the vault for free agents, with Kemp and pitcher Clayton Kershaw as selling points. Kemp has taken the road less traveled by stars. When they are humbled, embarrassed or unhappy, many look for the nearest exit. Kemp reinvented himself as a good teammate. His accountability and work ethic now attract other players to train with him over the winter, including Dexter Fowler. You can't win an MVP award in April playing the Padres and Pirates, but you can put the rest of the league on notice. The question now is how long before teams give him the Barry Bonds treatment and let somebody else in this flawed lineup beat them?

"But there is a fundamental disconnect between the perception and the reality. We have a culture that can drive people off."

So we can’t deny it. These are melancholic moments for most fans from this state, at least the ones who need some geographic validation. For many of us, this is a classic case of hathos — you know, hate/pathos, an attraction to something you really can’t stand. You love the game, but somehow hate the team for not sticking around — at least until your kids can at least decide whether it is worthy of their loyalty.

Michael Chiarello, the Food Network personality and former chef-partner of St. Helena's Tra Vigne, is back behind the stoves in Napa Valley after a decade-long absence. His new 90-seat restaurant, Bottega, in Yountville's V Marketplace (formerly Vintage 1870), was given a face-lift by local architect Michael Guthrie.

"On Sunday, Sept. 11, I went downtown to the Cleveland Pops concert. A policeman was sitting in his car, and I asked him if the concert was going to go on because it was raining. He said he had just gotten word to open up a street because the concert was canceled. Another SUV drove up and asked the same question and was turned away. On the 11 p.m. news I saw that the concert did go on. I was very upset and really wanted to go to it. Also I would like to moan about all the parking meters with orange covers on them saying 'no parking.' Why do they do that? I think it is bad public relations for the city when so many people can park on the street and it doesn't interfere with the flow of traffic."
* Don and Megan's Short, Strange Trip: Raise your hand if you also thought the projector had gotten the reels out of order (speaking of a '60s reference) when we saw Don getting excited about heading to Howard Johnson's with Megan. It took me several moments to figure out that this was the playing-out of the fleeting reference we'd seen earlier in the episode, as Roger's LSD storyline was beginning. Anyway, Don once again bullies past Megan's protestations -- she feels bad ditching Peggy and the rest of the Heinz team -- and insists she accompany him on the trip to Howard Johnson's. She complies, but is clearly not happy. As Don, in his own world of domestic bliss, tells her she must try the orange sherbet, she objects to his smoking in the car. And things go downhill from there. At the blandly cheery HoJo's, Don keeps wanting things his way, until Megan finally blows up. "Maybe you could make up a schedule for me so I'll know when I'm working, and when I'm the wife," she says. The fight continues to the parking lot, with Megan saying, "Get in the car, eat ice cream, leave work, take off your dress. Yes, master!" So much for the newlywed glow Roger had so envied. Instead of talking it out, Don gets in the car, and drives off, leaving Megan in the parking lot. Once he cools off and returns, she's gone. He waits, getting more frazzled by the moment, at HoJo's, but there's no sign of Megan. Finally, seven hours later, he heads home, and finds Megan there. They fight again, her yelling at him for leaving her there, him saying he thought she was dead. She tries to run away, but he follows her, and they both tumble onto the carpet. But the mood is very different from the beginning of the season, when we saw them in this same position after having had sex.
This newly published article details one of two clinical trials that were evaluated by the FDA before the agency decided to deny approval for Qnexa in October 2010.

Sarkozy also pushed for a new era of industrial relations when he came to power in 2007. But unions still hold enormous sway in France. When he faced down transit unions just months after his election over the scrapping of an early retirement age, it seemed a seminal moment for a country long hemmed in by organized labor. However, by 2010, strikes again paralyzed France as he fought to raise the retirement age to 62.

Otherwise, they have a badge and you may lose the argument."

You apparently learned your social skills from a park ranger. Playing dead is a successful strategy when you’re being chased by certain types of bears. When you’re hoping to be chased by a man, you need to go over and say hello. But, you whimper, you’re scared. Yeah, OK. But, why would that be reason to avoid doing it? By making yourself do something you’re afraid of, you shrink your fears and probably feel better afterward, unless it’s something like walking off the ledge of a tall building.
No. 16 Denver 15 No. 4 Duke 9: The host Pioneers (8-5) used a five-goal performance from Mark Matthews and 16 saves by Ryan LaPlante to halt the Blue Devils' winning streak at 10 games at the Whitman's Sampler Mile High Classic.

By its seventh year, the convention center must be 35 percent occupied, bring in 214,500 attendees (in- or out-of-town) and generate 33,000 hotel room stays.

Getting on one's Lycra and wearing it out in public is becoming a holiday tradition for some, however, as the Santa Speedo Run in Portland just celebrated its third year. I was a witness. There were plenty of Santa hats, suspenders and spandex skivvies to gawk at. Fundraising for the Ethiopia Project, the Santa Speedo 5K down Northwest 23rd Avenue, raised about $1,600 for the Portland nonprofit this month. With just 50 or so runners, that amount would not have been possible without a slew of unpaid volunteers and a large donation of beer from Deschutes Brewery. The Ethiopia Project gathers shoes to create recreational opportunities in Ethiopia. It also is working to help villages get clean water and build new schools. (Learn more about the Ethiopia Project online at Ethiopiaproject.com. The group needs money and volunteers -- and shoes.)

Love: In the meantime, "Good Vibrations" was our answer to that psychedelic era, to what was going on at the time. It's our most successful, unique song that we've ever done. Brian did an amazing job on it with the structure of the track, with the harmonies. I collaborated by writing the lyrics, "I'm picking up good vibrations." It was so unique in its use of the theremin. In fact, Rolling Stone said it was the single of the century.
Political leaders in Warsaw say they want to join the euro zone eventually. And they have cited stricter fiscal rules as something that could make joining more attractive, by lessening the risk of future debt crises.

More than 20 million Americans are living with diabetes, and another 40 million are in the early stages of the disease. Managing diabetes can be a challenge all year long, but the holidays can pose special problems. All those extra treats, meals and drinks can add up to extra pounds and higher glucose levels.

She's also the coordinator of Carroll Hospital Center's Diabetes Center.

And it's not just commerce. Once our friends and family knew our phone number and called us on our home phones -- but people who were neither could look us up and do the same. Now we increasingly carry cellphones instead of using landlines, and we don't want our new numbers listed. We don't see the need, because even though we have phones all the time, we're also reachable via text messages and email and social-networking sites -- and in many situations we're coming to prefer those communications methods to the insistent, one-size-fits-some summons of a ringing phone. Sometimes we don't need to communicate directly at all -- we drop by our friends' Web pages, Facebook profiles or MySpace outposts to get the latest, and update ours so they can do the same.

Actor Kevin Bacon brought his star power to a charity event Wednesday at the University of Maryland, College Park. The competition - called the "Do Good" Challenge - is part of an effort by the school to make philanthropy more of a focus in academics and student life. The winner was the Food Recovery Network, which developed a system of collecting food from campus dining halls that would otherwise go to waste and distributing it to homeless shelters.

While Ting can preach about the need to reset and redefine San Francisco politics with passion, it isn't clear that the strategy is paying off.

Like the topsy-turvy, inverted-logic "wonderland" of Lewis Carroll's famous story, Mexico and California, where several female surrealists settled, seemed places where the normal art-world rules were made to be broken. They were free-form zones where female artists felt empowered to explore their own fantasies at a comfortable distance from the male art-critical establishment in New York and Europe.
