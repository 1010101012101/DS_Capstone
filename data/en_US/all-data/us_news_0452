I wonder how these new ways of connecting, entertaining and learning will impact a child's development.

Bartók: Violin Concertos Nos. 1 and 2; Viola Concerto
War has been declared, and there's hardly any way to change the impression among a growing percentage of women that the GOP is the party of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals. It's a smart move for Democrats to keep replaying the message, but is it fair -- and is it true? ... Republicans are waging war on women only if you believe that the morality of abortion should never be questioned or if you believe the federal government can order people to pay for something that violates their conscience. These issues are not so simple, nor are Republicans simpletons for trying to protect the unborn or challenging what they view as government overreach. Unfortunately, the conservative governing principles that traditionally attracted level heads to the right side of the aisle have been incrementally subsumed by social issues -- a bull's-eye for Democrats and a black eye for Republicans. Inasmuch as women are the ones who most urgently require access to family planning, any opposition can be conflated to be anti-woman.

This could be the best chance the MAAC entrant has had to compete for the championship since Marist finished the inaugural tourney in third place in 2006. Fairfield's other loss was to Providence 80-72.
When American colonists found themselves under the boot of British rule, the king's forces were authorized to search any business or home and to seize anything they found objectionable. They carried "general writs of assistance" that did not specify persons, places, dates or alleged criminal activity, and were issued without a showing of probable cause. Often leading to severe punishment, the practice was essentially a method of state control.
Giner, who went to culinary school at Hudson County Community College, opened La Isla back in the days when Hoboken was more of an afterthought of a city than a competitive urban hot spot. Now, of course, he benefits from being on Washington Street, which itself was just named one of the 10 best streets in 2010 by the American Planning Association. Giner was here before Maricel Presilla opened her restaurants, and is proud to call the esteemed chef and historian a friend.

And to make the Veterans Day birth even more remarkable for Jacob, the boy's mother is an Air Force veteran and his father currently services in the Air Force.
Barrett and Falk have led the other Democratic candidates in fundraising and in the polls. Barrett has consistently led Falk in the polls, including a Marquette University Law School poll on May 2. That poll also showed Barrett and Walker in a virtual tie. Walker defeated Barrett to win the office in 2010.
Gardner spent at least part of his childhood in the San Bernardino Mountains community of Running Springs and attended nearby Rim of the World High School, according to the document. He was convicted in 1998 of disturbing the peace in an incident that involved trespassing on campus, his only previous criminal record at the time.
Federal Hill resident Sarah Kramm moved to Baltimore six months ago, and said she is just getting used to the traffic patterns. She's not even attempting to navigate through the street closures and detours associated with the Grand Prix. She's headed to New Orleans instead.
"The start for me was great," Stinson said. "I was leading. I seemed to get out well and was surprised by it. I'm not known for my speed."
Her report also found that 87 percent of public drinking incidents involved malt liquor and only 3 percent distilled spirits. The rest involved wine.
Underscoring that they had learned the consequences of seeming to block a middle-class tax cut, House Republicans removed the major hurdle to the legislation earlier this week when they agreed that the payroll tax cut -- comprising about two-thirds of the measure's cost -- would not have to be paid for with spending cuts.
I looked away and laughed again. Then it came.
“I couldn’t believe the wind and the rain that hit us,” Colon said. “You could see parts of a roof flying around. We couldn’t tell if it was from City Hall or from one of the buildings around us.”
Fortunately, ongoing talks among Dayton and legislators indicate that a "win-win" finish to the 2012 session is still possible. From our vantage, it doesn't look all that difficult. The tax cuts in the GOP bill are not overly large in the next year. Neither is their focus on business tax relief objectionable at a time when the economy needs bolstering.
But those aren't the only mysteries in the case.

Spalding orchestrated a big possession game for the host Seahawks, who also had an exceptional shooting night, hitting all seven shots in the first half and 11 of 17 in the game.
North Carolina singer Eric Church broke into the upper tier of Music City artists last year with "Chief," his third album, which aligned him with the outlaw country tradition of Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash. The big hit was "Drink in My Hand," a maddeningly catchy roadhouse number about how much he likes to booze. Most of the rest of the set reinforces his wild-man persona: If you know anything about contemporary country music, you can fill in the lyrics to "Jack Daniels" and "I’m Gettin’ Stoned" without having heard either one.
A: The first printing of Eich's request didn't turn up any recipes. We provided one that seemed similar, and then the floodgates opened.
3. Make the filling: In a bowl, whisk egg, then whisk in ricotta, garlic and chopped parsley. (Filling may be made in advance; cover and refrigerate.)
Soft-spoken words like these are a kind of language unto itself, which both patient and doctor understand, even though the word underlying it all is never uttered. Landolfi is all too practiced in this. As a neuro-oncologist, and one of the foremost brain tumor specialists in the state, his is perhaps the toughest of all medical specialties — one in which successes are often modest, often measured in just a few more months of life.
Dedicated in 1911, it is, on many levels, ridiculous -- and not only because it was built to protect a birth cabin that turned out to be a hoax. "It is odd-looking," says Jennie Jones, a National Park Service ranger who has been stationed there for 17 years. "Lincoln was such a humble man. He would probably say, 'Oh, you shouldn't do that for me.'
What struck me on a couple of recent dinners at SideBern's was just how contemporary and big-city the menu has become. Just like in New York, the cocktails read more like exotic recipes (chili-infused Corzo tequila with watermelon, lime juice and agave nectar, $13). The lounge menu has all this great charcuterie, each meat paired with a dreamy accompaniment. I'm not sure how many orders they're getting for top-of-the-line Iberico ham ($21), but just knowing these plush, richly marbled slices are there, paired with toasted hazelnuts, is a comfort. They are importing the good stuff, but also curing and making their own these days: a delicious ham hock terrine ($8) with Georgia peaches, a warm sweet-and-sour beef tongue ($10). Then pair that with an order of Bellwether Farms fresh ricotta ($8) enlivened with mint, chili, olive oil and citrus. Gorgeous.
Zaneski said she is done walking the tracks.
There have been several clutch situations over the past week in which Orioles hitters have been overanxious at the plate and gotten themselves out when they should be making the opposing pitcher sweat. The O's also have failed to get down a bunt at a couple of key moments.
Obama said the new requirements will save 1.8 billion barrels of oil over the life of the program, which will cover the 2012-2016 model years. The new standards come four years ahead of a 2007 energy law that required the auto industry to meet a 35 mpg average by 2020.
Acids must be neutralized before they return to the water system. Atmospheric emissions pass through "scrubbers" designed to absorb airborne chemicals in water. Solid waste is taken away for recycling or disposal.
Vestas considered moving out of Oregon and also looked closely at Tom Moyer's stalled Park Avenue West tower and at Jim Winkler and Bob Naito's proposed One Waterfront Place. "They picked that location, and they picked Gerding Edlen, and we said, 'OK, at that site, this is what we could do,'" Andrews said.
Roasting: Preheat oven to 400°. Remove turkey from brine, rinse and dry well. Spread 2 tablespoons softened butter over skin. Sprinkle pepper over skin and in cavity. Tuck wing tips under, loosely truss legs and place turkey on a V-shaped rack in a roasting pan. Tent breast with foil.
But when that's done, it's worth asking when the far more common killings of black children will generate as much outrage and deserve as much attention.
Officers showed up, along with paramedics, and they encountered numerous other individuals who all seemed highly intoxicated. One 15-year-old girl was unable to stand on her own.
I work with a computer based testing company and have found that using computer based exams help meet the diverse needs of exam administrators in the academic, certification and licensing realms. Computer based tests provide fair and easy access to everyone. Moreover, enabling the use of computers would improve readability, thereby simplifying the grading process and deter cheating.

It makes a big PR splash about how concerned it is about head injuries and following strict protocol to protect players from bluffing their way back into games and further endangering themselves.
"It wasn't the whole church who did it," she said. "It was some individual human beings. It's sad that they covered it up. That's what they used to do in the old days, and that wasn't a great decision."
Dorsey said he's "kicked the tires" with John Carney, who was fired last week from KEZK (102.5 FM), and would like him to do a show in that time slot if they can work out the details.
Tony's take: Tebow time one more time? Broncos, 24-21.
Holder, Matt and Beth. Matt is partners with Republican political consultant John Lewis. Beth, who is Buck Johns' kid, pretends not to be impressed by me - and at times barely conceals her loathing for my writing - but I cracked even her veneer when in an unscripted, amazingly Norby-esque moment of cocktail conversation, I recalled that the first four-minute mile in the U.S. was run at a track meet at her alma mater, the University of the Pacific, in 1957. Why did I remember that nugget? I think I was saving it up my whole life for that moment.
One man was arrested. Police are searching for three more.
Typical hobbies provide spare time recreation for millions of Americans, but a group of hobbyists known as ham radio operators use amateur radio technology to provide a valuable public service to their communities.
The Nets have played their last basketball game in New Jersey, if you even noticed. Now they’re the official property of Brooklyn, which hasn’t seen a major sports franchise in more than half a century. The Nets bring jobs, excitement and an angry send-off from Jersey Gov. Chris Christie:

What is clear, Tapogna said, is that all trends suggest Oregon schools will continue to have to cut offerings, raise class sizes or shorten the school year in coming years.
And if you’re a man? Please. How hard is a shave and a tuxedo, really? Very hard, apparently, for the clueless guys who show up every year in scratchy stubble and shiny black business suits, thinking it makes them look cool. (It does not. James Bond looks cool. You look like a rich wino.)
The hydropower dam, 125-feet high and 471-feet long, has a capacity of 14.7 megawatts, enough to power about 7,000 homes. PacifiCorp, an electric utility, concluded that removing it would cost its customers less than making upgrades for fish passage as part of federal dam relicensing.
Bargains: Food and drink discounts
Georgia Tech's Stephen Hill, who was expected to chat with the Ravens, is one player who is on the rise. The 6-foot-4 receiver ran a 4.36 in the 40-yard dash, which was tied for the best mark at the position. Iowa’s Marvin McNutt impressed reporters with his hands. Stanford’s Chris Owusu also ran a 4.36 in the 40-yard dash and finished in the top 10 in the five major drills. All three could be selected by a team on the draft’s second day.
And that overlooks the curious time machine, a giant, circular brass contraption, built steampunk-style, that rolls across the lobby floor. The museum used its art set-aside, the money all new projects must devote to art as they build, to commission artist Steven Weitzman to make a massive terrazzo map of Colorado. Embedded in the floor are 11 markers designating key historic spots.
Tickets for the all-you-can-eat dinner are $20, and can be purchased through PayPal by sending money to kaylas.fund@gmail.com. The family asks those purchasing dinner tickets to add $0.01 to the total to distinguish between a dinner ticket purchase and a donation - so, a purchase of 3 tickets would be $60.01.

So for now, SpyMedia has put notices on its MySpace ``widget'' that informs people that its service is ``powered by Spymedia'' -- hoping interested users will get the message and go to SpyMedia separately.
"Bachelor Party" (1984): Tom Hanks plays the bachelor of the title, whose friends throw him a big party; disaster ensues. It's sort of like a lesser precursor of "The Hangover," not nearly as funny. Still, Hanks is Hanks, and he brings his dopey school-bus driver character a lot of charm. If you want to remember what middling '80s sex comedies are like, this is a pretty good example.
The chicken and shrimp cheese steak ($8.50) was a gorgeously gooey sub filled with fried shrimp, chopped chicken, American cheese and fixed up with caramelized onion, lettuce and hot pepper spread.

Now Patterson has opened Coi, which is an arcane French word (pronounced "kwa") meaning tranquil. It's an apt name for the peaceful environment he's created with the help of designer Scott Kester, who made the most of the awkward space once occupied by the casual Route 66. Though there aren't any windows in the dining room, Kester has created an elegant, intimate bunker awash in brown.
A résumé’s purpose is to send clear, well-conceived messages about experience, capabilities and skills. But a résumé must also deliver the right subliminal messages about a candidate, who she is as a person and her approach to work. These messages often speak louder than the intentional ones in differentiating candidates.
So what do you do? You probably won't abandon the fun of holiday snacking, but try to balance, say experts.

There is no need for another office building on Chagrin Boulevard based on current vacancy rates in the Chagrin Corridor. I don’t see a market for one at this time or anytime in the next 3-5 years. No one wants to build an office building until the proposed building is at least 50 percent leased and this is a rarity in today’s market because it doesn’t make financial sense. Beside the fact that there are no lenders to construct an empty building.
In the latest move last week, a ruling party lawmaker demanded full surveillance and monitoring of all foreign money going to about 65,500 Indian charities — which amounted to about $6.5 billion between 2007 and 2010 — in what some critics are calling a "witch hunt."
Senior DeVier Posey looked ready for the season right now at last Saturday's scrimmage, when, unofficially, he caught five passes for 82 yards and grabbed the only two touchdown passes caught in 85 plays.

We were escorted to a back bar area and given glasses of wine to tide us over while we waited for a table. The floor show was lively as waiters balanced huge trays of food and danced around children who were clearly vying for control of the room. Just as we drained our glasses, a table opened up by the huge picture windows, and we were treated to a simple and delicious meal of pizza and grilled vegetables, capped by affogato. Usually, this ice cream is laced with a shot of espresso, but here they used whiskey to create a sublime treat.

"I think it's a deliberative process and that the executive is an important part of the process," Miller said. "In the grand scheme of things, the things we see differently, it's small compared to the overall size of the budget. And I'm confident we can work it out."
The only GM plant affected by the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan is a truck assembly plant in Shreveport, La., spokeswoman Kim Carpenter said. That plant will be closed for at least a week, starting Monday, with no date set for operations to resume.

Here's how "Sunshine Muse" came into being. I started writing reviews for Artforum in 1965, when the magazine was located in L.A., with its office on Gallery Row on La Cienega Boulevard. Even when I took a teaching job in Texas for three years (with a few trips home), I kept contributing to the magazine that had succeeded ArtNews as the authenticator of cutting-edge art. So when an editor from art-book publisher Praeger asked the magazine's managing editor John Coplans who might write a book for them about West Coast contemporary art, he pointed them to me.
It's all presented in that deadpan Duplass Brothers style — abrupt zooms used for comic effect, silly, over-the-top sibling arguments followed by sentimental brotherly bonding. But "Jeff, Who Lives at Home" takes the Duplass art to a new, deeper place. Credit the cast or the characters tripping through well-worn situations and relationships, but this is far and away their best movie.

"I have no issue on educating the public on the wrongs of abortion. But I think the young man is mistaken to try to do damage to a committed soldier in this battle," Kern told the newspaper.

A. You know how simple it is to re-stripe most intersections with nothing more than a sandblaster and a bucket of white paint. Most of us have seen road crews knock out the job in a day. Well, that's not the case here.

That's the word at the Nov. 12 closing night of the 34th Starz Denver Film Festival. The movie to be screened is "The Artist," a black and white, silent movie about Hollywood between 1927 and 1931, when the talkies took over. It is the romantic story of a male star on the way down and a female star ascending. Music, yes. Talking, no, just the intertitles telling you what they're saying.

A feminist from Ohio has more in common with her sisters in Texas, than in Washington or New York. We can't walk into rooms full of strangers and assume everyone shares our high regard for the countless gifts of women. Instead, we're recruiters to the cause, from the minute we slide into our slippers until our busy minds finally surrender to dreams that will likely startle us awake by 4 a.m.

Seekers of the Sierra's leafy gold can spend an entire day prowling this canyon and the busy creek that carved it. Rock Creek Canyon is unusual in this area because it faces north and south rather than east and west.

I, like many men, often told my wife that my love was aglow every day of the year, not just one day in particular. But that line only works once or twice in a relationship. And so it was that a few weeks before the special holiday for lovers, on a cold and blustery winter's day, I boldly asked Maria what she would like for Valentine's Day. Most years I could get off easily with dinner and a movie, but this year she said in a child-like tone, "Take me someplace warm."
The St. Louis dinner is part of three days of events marketed with tie-ins to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reporter whose vacation on the RMS Carpathia led to the scoop of lifetime when the ship responded to the Titanic's distress signal and helped rescue survivors. St. Regis hotels are throwing champagne-parties in honor of the chain's founder, John Jacob Astor IV, who died aboard the Titanic—not just in the New York hotel that Col. Astor opened in 1904 but also in more recently opened locations in Atlanta and in Tianjin, China.
Steve Rosenbloom, Chicago Tribune: "I've heard it said that Illinois is a basketball school. Actually, it's a bad-pig-farm-smell school, but as far as sports go, it's a basketball school by default, which doesn't mean it's a prime job. Sorry to break it to the fine burghers of Champaign and Urbana, but that's not a destination for a coach who plans to stick around. I mean, they teach history down there, don't they? Look, if you land a Bill Self-type again, you'd better find a replacement at the same time because he won't stick around much longer than most good freshmen do. Truth is truth. And a further truth is, a new athletic director usually wants his own guys running the department's two revenue-producing programs. Illini AD Mike Thomas brought in an underwhelming name to lead the football program. Wait, don't tell me. I'll get it. Tim
Hey, Donald: Belichick historically has had the philosophy of playing his starters throughout blowout games and at the end of seasons with playoffs already clinched. The prime example of this was in 2007 when the Patriots did not let up and finished the regular season at 16-0 despite clinching home-field advantage with two weeks to go. They rolled over two opponents in the playoffs and then were upset in the Super Bowl by the Giants.

This whimsical fondant-coated cake, made to serve eight, is a signature piece, although the bakers have a delicate, feminine streak as well. Expect quality textures and flavors.
"We share the dissenters' premise that every death penalty case raises the most profound issues of morality and social justice," Justice Thomas Balmer wrote for the majority in denying the request by a legal-defense center to halt the execution. "The record before us, however, demonstrated no legal error" by Guimond.
In time, the game spread statewide.
In April, Vickers' mummified remains were discovered in her dilapidated Benedict Canyon house by a neighbor; the condition of Vickers' body suggested she had been dead almost a year. The gruesome tableau became the actress' sad legacy. But this DVD commentary, taped only three years before her death, provides a better way to remember her. Vickers laughs often and displays a sharp memory, reminiscing about being directed by James Cagney and roughed up onscreen by Steve McQueen. The actress says she conjured Rita Hayworth's "Gilda" in a "50 Foot Woman" dancing scene, and was so good at playing bad girls that "every woman in Hollywood thought I was a husband-stealer."

Most of the authority's losses are tied to the operations of the two race tracks.

Some of the prettiest examples of neon aren't involved with gambling at all. One of the small classics is from the old Flame Restaurant. The sign, from 1961, was for an eatery that used to sit near the Desert Inn (where the Wynn now stands). The Chief Hotel Court is the oldest restored sign, a 1940s classic from an old downtown motel.
On Saturday at 6:30 and 8:30 p.m., Stryker returns to a more conventional jazz club format at Shanghai Jazz, one of the area’s most consistent jazz hot spots since 1995.

"We always respond well, whether it's at home or on the road. Every time we get slapped around and get a cold shower, we always seem to respond well. Obviously, you don't want to be put in those situations to begin with, but the reality is we're playing against good teams, good players, good coaching staffs that prepare well so you're doomed to have off nights once in a while."
The research is a collaboration between the engineering school and department of psychology. It began with detailed interviews with the participants, some of whom have cognitive impairments, about their daily habits in order to get a bead on which domestic task or activity occurs at a given time.

Moving so quickly required some arm-twisting. The tracks the commission wanted to use were largely under the control of the Santa Fe, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific railroads. Some of the tracks saw little commercial use, but many sections were and remain critically important for transport of cargo to and from the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. News reports at the time said the commission resorted to threats of eminent domain, particularly against the economically vulnerable Santa Fe Railroad. In the end, the SCRRA acquired access to almost 500 miles of local track. Some was purchased outright, but much of it came in the form of easements on what are now Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Union Pacific lines.

1. Get every kid's cholesterol checked (yours, too). Heart-health experts now recommend that all kids have a cholesterol test between 9 and 11, and again between 17 and 21. Out-of-whack numbers -- total cholesterol over 189, LDLs over 119, triglycerides over 114, healthy HDLs below 45 -- mean it's time for the whole family to eat smarter and move more. Few kids need cholesterol-lowering medications.

That launched a deluge of memories; of sympathy cards never sent, and calls never made, and church dinners at which I sat with the same group of friends every time. I don't mean to be thoughtless and self-absorbed. In my own head it's always about being too busy to chat as I zip from task to task at church; too forgetful to follow up with people who are hurting; too hungry for time with my own friends to divert attention to others.

The Missouri legislature recently passed a law that requires animal shelters such as the Humane Society of Missouri and Stray Rescue to pay a license fee and a head tax on every dog and cat adopted. These are non-profit organizations that help dogs and cats that have been discarded to the streets or given up by owners, and also those rescued from puppy mills. What will the legislature do next to make the lives of these animals more miserable and punish those who try to help them?

* Strategic access: Ever since the czars made Russia a major power, Moscow has sought a warm-water port so its fleet can sail the world’s seas even during its frozen winter.

For many graduates, staying on their parents' plan is likely to be the best option. "Most employer plans have good benefit packages," says Sara Collins, a vice president at the Commonwealth Fund, a private organization that studies health-care issues.

The matchup that we are all hoping to see is Jared Sullinger and Thomas Robinson, two All-Americas and arguably the two best low-post scorers in the country. The interesting part here is that Jeff Withey may actually be a better matchup on Sullinger defensively for the Jayhawks. Sullinger struggles when he is guarded by players with more length and athleticism than him; Withey is 7-feet and one of the most dangerous shot-blockers in the country. The problem with that is Robinson would be forced to guard Deshaun Thomas. If Sullinger and Robinson do get matched up with each other, it will be a treat for every fan to enjoy; both players thrive on their strength and ability to establish position in the post. But where Robinson thrives on his natural athleticism to score over players he overpowers, Sullinger -- while heftier and more of a land-warrior -- is much more skilled and technical on the block.
