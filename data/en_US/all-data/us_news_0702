Dear My: I would stop smiling. What is going on is somewhere between dim and mean. While I am generally in favor of using humor to defuse uncomfortable situations, I am not recommending it in your case because this aggressive effort to push food on you that is harmful is beyond someone saying things that are merely thoughtless. No offense, but these family members are either incredibly thick or strangely unconcerned with your health. The next time this happens, I would ask: "What part of my doctor's orders do you not understand? And why would you want me to eat something that would cause a serious reaction? While you are free to eat whatever you like, I would consider it a favor if you would not rave about something you are enjoying that you know I cannot have." When people seriously misstep, I have no interest in sparing their feelings. — Margo, directly

Almost half of the pending vacancies are classified as "judicial emergencies," as they have been vacant for more than one year. The president generally receives recommendations for district judgeships from the home-state senator from the president's party. With respect to appellate judgeships, the home-state senator will often make his or her wishes known to the White House. President Barack Obama has been slower than his predecessors to make judicial nominations, and the Senate has been far slower in its pace for judicial confirmations than was the case under Obama's predecessors. In some cases, the home-state senators have not agreed upon a recommendation to the president, thereby delaying the nomination. A system of blocks and holds has grown up in the Senate, whereby a single senator can place a "hold" on a nomination for any reason. Unless and until that hold is lifted, the Senate Judiciary Committee will not schedule a confirmation hearing on a given nomination. Often, the block or hold has nothing whatsoever to do with the nominee's qualifications but is the product of an unrelated dispute between senators or between the Senate and the president.

You feel good because it's done, and you don't have to think about it anymore. You could say the same thing about open heart surgery, or rehab.

A word or two about this traumatic (for Tom) move. According to "The Five-Year Engagement," Ann Arbor, Mich., is the most terrible place on Earth, while San Francisco is a sophisticate's nirvana.

Meanwhile, the clock is ticking, and the U.S. is inching closer to a potentially disastrous credit default. There is no Dean Wormer to plague, no Neidermeyer on whom to take revenge, only the American public to victimize.

I suppose it depends on the message:

Both players are under a lot of pressure after the Timbers hyped each player as one of their "big" signings.

(The Phoenix Police Department) has tons of neighborhood watches and wonderful residents who we enjoy working with. We do numerous events with and for the public.

The real-life inspiration for the movie was the Nipah virus, which does infect fruit bats, palm sap and pigs. Sometimes pig farmers catch it from their animals, sometimes people get it straight from palm sap that has been contaminated by infected bats. Nipah virus has been known to spread person to person, but only under conditions involving prolonged, close physical contact. In this way it's much like Ebola, an animal virus much better adapted to its original host than to people.

One advantage of a game that has a small crowd should be that lines are shorter; but no, the Dodgers shut down parking gates and concession stands so you still spend half the night standing in line. They advertise a "family" atmosphere and Nancy Bea on the keyboards, yet you go to the game and you get thumping drums, rap music and AC/DC so loud that you can't hear yourself think. They should have an "aspirin night" to kill the headache they give you. The list goes on and on.

A methodically aggressive puncher, Cotto certainly understands he can't beat Mayweather if he stays on the perimeter. But as the late Angelo Dundee observed just a few days before he died in February, "The one thing that Cotto can't do is go crazy and just chase Mayweather into the ropes." As Ricky Hatton and others will attest, that is where Mayweather will bite you with that short left hook, or uncoil his snaking, counter right hand.

Under both Republican and Democratic presidents, Voinovich was an often lonely voice for fiscal restraint in Washington. Forced to make tough choices as both mayor of Cleveland for 10 years and governor of Ohio for eight -- he famously wept after ending the state's meager cash assistance to poor, unmarried adults -- Voinovich never understood why Washington refused to face the pain of living within its means.

He is also a severe chewer. I hated to do it, but I finally got him a crate. He gets plenty of attention throughout the day even when I'm at class or work because my roommates care for him in my absence. When I exercised him even more, he became worse in his chewing and hyper-active behavior.

At first, I didn't believe him. He's not typically a liar, but he had to be lying about this, right? Then I looked myself and he was absolutely correct. The French-language newspaper Le Derniere Heure had printed a 3-D edition. There were some differences -- they printed all their photos and ads stereoscopically, and left the body text alone -- but there were some similarities, including glasses. There it was, too soon for anyone's comfort: the joke dragged kicking and screaming into the real world.

People stood in absolute silence, watching. The Palace, built in 1876, in the city's champagne and silver bonanza days, was the symbol of the city. A U.S. flag, raised that morning at dawn, continued to fly, sometimes becoming invisible behind the smoke, which would roll away revealing the flag once more still flying. Then it vanished in one last tongue of flame.

John Hofmeister, former chairman of Shell Oil, estimates that opening up U.S. proven reserves could raise U.S. oil production to 10 million barrels a day while still adhering to prudent environmental safeguards.
We visited on a Wednesday, which also is $9.95 pasta night. The diner offers a selection of pasta dishes for the set price, which includes a bowl of soup. We chose the pasta with bacon, peas and onions in a light aioli sauce, a hearty serving large enough to satisfy any appetite.

Through the perspective of a newcomer named Ray (Ray Salyer), "On the Bowery" captures — without pity or judgment — the full extent of this sadness and madness, and suggests the perilous ease of falling into it. Ray, a strapping Southerner fresh off a railroad job in Jersey, shows up with a tattered suitcase, which he loses after a night of hard drinking. He befriends the grizzled barflies (including a cirrhotic geezer named Gorman), loiters on street corners in the hope of finding day work and swears off booze only to fall off the wagon again.

It might appear ungracious to call "The Pale King" annoyingly repetitive and disjointed because Wallace left it unfinished when he committed suicide. Yet those are its most pronounced qualities, and Wallace explicitly set out to explore the connection between boredom and pain.

He succeeds in this, but it's a dubious and dreary achievement.

Still, let's acknowledge the sweeteners that the good-government types put into Proposition 28 to appeal to skeptics.

So with bits and pieces of unexpired terms added in, the true maximum time someone can potentially serve is 17 years. Not under Proposition 28. Twelve years, and that's it. It's excessively stern, but if it comforts voters enough to go for it, then fine.

Jackman was a minus-3 and while Shattenkirk was even, he was on the ice for two of L.A.'s goals. It's a no-brainer, we need to step our game up, we need to be ready to take on some big minutes and some big players on their team," Shattenkirk said. "I think we're ready for the challenge. We're both not happy with we've been going so far. We both know that we have another gear that we're ready to reach."

Where is Afghanistan policy headed at this crucial moment? As the nation's excellent if unsung war commander, Gen. John Allen, testifies on Capitol Hill this week, and as Republican presidential aspirants continue to attack President Barack Obama from both the left and the right on the subject, these questions are especially timely. Will the president soon be tempted to say that with Osama bin Laden dead (on the positive side), but with the Afghan and Pakistani governments still very hard to work with and the insurgency still resilient (on the negative side), it's simply time to declare victory, cut our losses and get the forces home fast?

A: The globe-willow tree is native to eastern Asia/China and is susceptible to a whole multitude of pests and diseases -- so much so that it's not a tree I recommend. If the tree is overwatered, it becomes susceptible to iron chlorosis, which can cause the new leaves to be yellow and tips to die back. A disease called frothy flux can cause the same symptoms. Check the new leaves; if the veins are green while the rest of the leaf is yellow, you can consider adding iron chelate to the soil, following label directions.

Also, if you foul a player before the ball is inbounded it is a free throw plus the ball. If you do it in the final two minutes of the game, it's two free throws and the ball. It is pretty much known as the Shaq Rule.

Pinker says one of the main reasons for the drop in violence is that we are smarter. IQ tests show that the average teenager is smarter with each generation. The tests are constantly adjusted to keep the average at 100, and a teenager who now would score a 100 would have scored a 118 in 1950 and a 130 in 1910. So this year's average kid would have been a near-genius a century ago. And that increase in intelligence translates into a kinder, gentler world, Pinker says.

All this brand marketing has an impact, healthy-eating advocates say.
The discounter drummed up so much hype around its exclusive, limited-time line by upscale Italian designer Missoni that its website crashed and was down most of the day on Sept. 13 when the collection was launched, angering customers.

Sharyn Rowe, tax analyst for Clackamas County Assessment & Taxation, who received one of the notices herself, said she fields calls from servicers regularly. Errors happen frequently when servicer employees from offshore locations call the assessor about the status of a borrower's tax payment. Sometimes the caller misunderstands what Rowe and co-workers tell them about its status. The servicer then sends in a payment to the county before the borrower does and adds an escrow account to the loan, raising the borrower's monthly payment.

When the Giants brought up Posey two years ago and played him at first base, he quickly made it known that he is a catcher. You don't let your players run the team, but you also don't want an unhappy Buster Posey.
During the last round of El Nino, I received a flurry of calls from angry cruise ship passengers who paid for a Mexican cruise to Cabo San Lucas only to get to sea and be told that due to bad weather, the ship would go no further south than Ensenada.

With Jack Lew and Gene Sperling in charge of its economic policy, the administration's Clintonian direction is clear. It will seek higher revenue, cuts in defense, spending caps and more aggressive health care price controls. When measuring deficit reduction, the last is the most important.

Unless this problem is addressed, no tax increase or cut in discretionary spending will cause federal outlays to flatten at a sustainable percentage of the economy.

With a natural love of competition, she earned a few blue ribbons along the way.
Martinez was one of the few reporters in Veracruz who continued to work on drug cartel-related stories.

I ate reasonably well. Among the streaks kept alive: no pop. But I dreaded the dawn of Day 8, when I knew the health-food diet would get its first major test because I would be covering a game (Monsters vs. Hershey) for the first time since the project began.
