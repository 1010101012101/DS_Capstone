With the right investments and environment supporting biomedical innovation, the U.S. research community believes we can stop Alzheimer's by 2020 -- cutting trillions from the 10-year health care tab, sparing millions of Americans the devastation that is Alzheimer's, and reinvigorating the economy with increased productivity and job creation.

French President Nicolas Sarkozy and President Obama were caught with their microphones still on after a news conference at the G-20 meeting in Cannes, France. According to the website Arret Sur Images, Mr. Sarkozy said about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: "I can't look at him anymore, he's a liar," to which Obama reportedly replied, "You're fed up with him, but I have to deal with him every day." That's not exactly a confidence builder for Israel and the West that these two leaders understand where the real threat is coming from.

The Berea Republican's bill would add extortion and perjury to the list of crimes that could cause those convicted to lose their public pensions. Under Ohio law for the past several years, public officials convicted of bribery, racketeering or theft in office already are subject to possible pension clawbacks.
There's really no excuse for Congress not to pass the American Jobs Act. The unwillingness of the House majority leader and his "can't think for themselves" crew is downright ludicrous! This is not a time to present more foolishness into this country, it is time for some serious thought to rescue this country from a financial downturn. The world is watching the strongest country in the world indulge in petty and childish acts of self-destruction. Believe me when I say others are just waiting and biding their time to overtake and rule this country. We're being ridiculed, laughed at and disrespected because they see how this country treats and disrespects its own president.
LEO (July 22-August 21): You and a certain party don't have to see eye-to-eye as long as your hearts are in the right place.
Galen is a rare specimen: a deeply unhappy protagonist whose unhappiness rarely proves stale or static. His daily quest is simple and impossible: to escape his own body, his own desires and his own life. "The only problem now," he feels, is "how to slip beyond the edges of the dream." He starves himself until he feels "dizzy, the top of his head gone, a floating sensation" he doesn't "want to lose"; he lies out on the walnut drying racks and tries to "stare at the sun, forget this existence, find something else."

By that, Meyer means the entire passing offense, which he called one of the worst in America last season. He thought Miller had a very good spring, and graded him right now as an A on his release point, a B on arm strength -- "but I'm very critical," Meyer said -- and a B or C on accuracy.

The Ducks will have to win three games in three days to lock up a bid in the NCAA tournament, a considerably easier feat than winning four games in four days. To do so they will need the consistency they've got all season from Joseph, Singler and Sim, and increased productivity from Carlos Emory will surely help. Right now, Sim said, there is no reason to think Oregon won't keep rolling.

The heart and soul of Francis Lewis, she sacrificed her scoring this year, but did just about everything else. Davis, a senior, was the team’s defacto point guard, its best defender, top rebounds and leader on and off the court en route to the PSAL Class AA semifinals for a second straight year.
I kept the classic Romaine base, but bulked it up with roasted cubes of butternut squash. Warm and substantial, butternut is the perfect base for a robust Caesar dressing.

Dr. Beach still doesn't think much of California. Coronado Beach is the only Golden State strand on the list, which has become the gold standard of beach ratings.
To most people, this would seem to make sense — he had a government-issued license he didn't need anymore. But to Mr. Kamenetz and anyone else steeped in Baltimore County laws, that sounds like throwing money down the drain. After all, where Mr. Kamenetz comes from, liquor licenses aren't mere permission slips from the county, they are salable commodities, and valuable ones at that. Licenses are traded from one owner to another in an arcane and highly regulated system that serves to limit competition and enrich a lucky few. The system is inequitable and robs the county of a powerful economic development tool, and Mr. Kamenetz, to his credit, is determined to do something about it.

"It's tough to lose that way," Akron coach Caleb Porter said. "You get closer to winning the national championship, second place hurts. You get so close you can taste it. . . . What makes this one even more tough is that we didn't give up a goal, and yet we still don't take home any hardware."

Anyway, in the access we did have to Stanford players Friday during a structured interview session, they mostly seemed relaxed and eager to get on with things. My column for Saturday's paper is about what's exactly at stake here — be it Stanford's reputation or Virginia Tech's pride or whatever. But I also tried to have a little fun by asking Doug Baldwin, the Cardinal's top wide recveiver, to diagram the team's biggest play of the season.

In this video, I show you the play he drew up — you can freeze the frame if you really want to see it — and Wilner and I talk about it a little bit to speculate whether the play might work against Virginia Tech. I hope that Harbaugh isn't too upset. Or maybe I hope that he is. I'll be happy to talk with him at practice if he opens the gates.

However, sports game licensees are obligated to make a new game every year. It’s the system everyone is used to, even if they complain about it.

Critics paint a grim picture of what could happen if a pool packed with spent nuclear fuel loses cooling in a natural disaster or terrorist attack. Spent nuclear fuel could heat up to the point that the zirconium cladding catches fire, releasing radioactivity. The biggest threat comes from cesium 137 - the radioactive isotope that during the Soviet Union's 1986 Chernobyl disaster rendered an area half the size of New Jersey uninhabitable. That disaster involved the release of 2 million to 3 million curies of cesium; the spent fuel pools at some U.S. reactors contain several times more than that.

"Of course I would have ordered the taking out of Osama bin Laden. Of course. This is a person who had done terrible harm to America and who represented a continuing threat to civilized people throughout the world," Romney said. "If I had been president of the United States, I would have made the same decision the president made, which was to remove him. And actually, I acknowledged a year ago when this was announced that the president deserved credit for the decision he made and I continue to believe that and certainly would have taken that action myself."
Bringing a villain to justice might get a little tricky if you also happen to be the one who did the crime (or at least the one playing him). But we'll leave those kinds of complications in the capable hands of San Diego-based actor and funnyman Phil Johnson.

The truth is that Friday's report about U.S. employment in March was a huge disappointment compared with the previous three months. The Labor Department estimated that employers added 120,000 workers in March, compared with more than 200,000 in each of the three previous months. Of course, that's just an initial assessment; it could be revised up or down in future months as better data come in.

The bill fails to take into account the complexities of the hotel industry, with layers of owners, franchisees and management companies, each with its own interests, she says.

The Shaker Lakes were hopping with new arrivals during a bird walk Saturday hosted by the Kirtland Bird Club. Topping our list was American bittern. Others were Caspian tern, green heron, solitary and spotted sandpipers, hermit thrush, Nashville, yellow, palm, pine, and yellow-rumped warblers, many ruby-crowned kinglets, and a blue-headed vireo.

Philosophically, Parker went on, "I am interested in people's opinions. Overall, I think the world improves because of a variety of input. So you gotta listen. I think I've been democratically attuned to listening as an attitude in life. Maybe if I were trying to build the best American collection in the world, and forget about European art and forget about Oceanic, forget modern and forget textiles, maybe we'd have a better American museum today. On the other hand, would we have lost the interest of people who love textiles, who love African art? Would the African American community relate less well if we had pursued Cezanne? There are a lot of people who would tell you to narrow your focus, concentrate your energies, shuck the people who don't agree with you -- just do your thing as well as you possibly can. It's not that they're wrong. It's just that this institution has a different mission, and it has to absorb all this different input. Its mission is to reflect the world. And have everybody see a little of themselves in the museums' collections.''

However, in last year's World Series, the Rangers suffered a sixth-game loss that was nothing less Indians-like in depth and breadth, and then lost the series in seven games to the St. Louis Cardinals of Tony La Russa.

Romney can deliver the entrepreneurial vibe but he has a maddening tendency to hedge. His economic plan is a 59-point hodgepodge. He will push for lower taxes, less regulation, more drilling. All well and good, but this is a classic example of Churchill's pudding that has no theme. Compare Romney's pudding to the central element of Reagan's economic platform  a 30-percent across-the-board tax-rate cut.

If he wants to call it a day, though? We completely, and utterly understand. And while every mention of the guy's name will bring up images of dour press conferences, his placement above Kevin Durant in the 2007 NBA draft, and all those 23-and-12s that we never got to watch, let's remember that those 82 games were significant.

"They had some other guys step up tonight," Howell Central coach Larry Anders said. (Lowrey) and (Boyd) did what they needed to do to win a ball game. It's district time, everybody's got to step up and they did it. Just a grinding, ugly game. (Our seniors) deserve better.

Like its better-known cousins creme anglaise and pastry cream, sabayon is a stirred custard, so named because it is stirred as it sets. Unstirred custards are baked, usually in a water bath (think cheesecake and flan).
Some on the Blue Ribbon Commission naively suggested that the new tax increases may not be passed on to the consumer by the gas station dealers and their suppliers. Well I can tell you that after having worked in the oil industry for over 40 years, the tax increase will be passed directly to consumers. These dealers are small businesses with very small operating margins and they cannot afford to absorb an increase in the excise tax. The same applies to small delivery and trucking businesses and families in regard to the proposed increased cost of inspections and registration fees.

Rental companies have used these GPS units for other purposes. In one highly documented case, a rental company charged a driver $150 each time the car exceeded 79 miles an hour for more than a minute or two, and the driver racked up several $150 "instances" during a single one-way extra-speed Interstate cruise. California, New York, and possibly some other states have enacted laws prohibiting rental companies from using GPS information this way, but you can't count on being exempt anywhere else.
Twinsburg: City officials tried to work with developers and manufacturers to find a new employer to fill the stamping plant. But hope for replacing Chrysler with another job producer fell apart in March when Canada's Maynards Industries bought the plant at a U.S. Bankruptcy Court auction.

A further complication is Measure A. Adopted in 1973 to curtail the destruction of Victorians and discourage excessive development, it prohibits building any residential structure larger than a duplex. SunCal is seeking a waiver for Alameda Point. The matter may wind up on the ballot in November.
But apparently tax money didn't cover all the bills. (Final totals aren't in yet.) Republicans also turned to campaign accounts — and special interests — to pick up the tab. Sure, lobbyist-sponsored trips were outlawed a few years back. But they claimed they were using old, pre-ban money. Of course they were.
In 2008, however, a cranky board warned that rate increases "should be in line with current inflation and cost of living increases" and that "it is inappropriate for the bureaus to continue internal business as usual and to increase their rates to cover their spending."

The trial resumes Wednesday morning with the testimony of Ryan Kendall, a gay man who is expected to recount going through "conversion therapy" in his youth. Plaintiffs lawyers have indicated they will finish their case Wednesday. It remains unclear whether they intend to call any leaders of the Prop. 8 campaign. Prop. 8 lawyers, meanwhile, say they know they have two experts who will testify for their side, quite a few less than originally forecast. Prop. 8 lawyer Andrew Pugno said some witnesses refused to testify with the prospect of a televised trial still in the air.

However, a separate proposal to create a compensation commission to address those who suffered losses as a result of the Lower North Fork Fire is premature, in our view.
When a parishioner discusses prior behavior, especially in the context of seeking penance, as appeared to be the case with Bragg, it falls under a well-established privilege in Michigan law, the appeals court said. The communication does not have to have occurred in the context of a formal confession, and the privilege was not waived because Bragg's mother, an employee of the church, was present, the court said.

Researchers in Maryland reviewed school and health insurance records, focusing on more than 27,000 children who were age 8 in 2008 and lived in Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Cecil, Harford and Howard counties. All had some indication of a developmental or behavior disorder, including almost three quarters of the children who already had an autism diagnosis.
Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson -- the "Resident Evil" guy, not the "Boogie Nights" one -- this "Musketeers" generally follows Dumas' plot. But many embellishments (and occasional bowdlerizations) dramatically alter the tone. The comic-book style and 3-D CGI effects turn a story loosely based on historical events into one that's utterly detached from anybody's real life, now or then.

Talk about change: Santorum’s triumph in Iowa will bring him much-needed money and support, and if he survives New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida this month, he’ll be tough. Blindsided, the Obamanauts must now regroup, and figure out how to trash the devout Roman Catholic former senator. Thanks to the president’s sorry record, winning ugly is just about the only hope they have.
In Rick Perry and Mitt Romney, we have undiluted representatives of each type. Perry is purposely provocative in style and content. He questions the legitimacy of 70 years of federal entitlement commitments. He proposes a fundamental reordering of the relationship between the federal government and the states. He is highly critical of the Federal Reserve and its chairman. Perry's specific economic policies remain defiantly unspecific but his rhetoric and intentions are ideologically ambitious.
We have some nice traditions here. We do some special things around the holidays for sure. We have the pre-K come over to our home for Christmas cookies. I read Christmas stories. It's getting harder and harder emotionally. I really struggle to keep it together with all the beautiful little people there. And one evening during Christmas, we have the entire eighth-grade come in for a formal, sit-down dinner at the home followed by a very spirited gift exchange, a Yankee Swap kind of format. The kids absolutely love it.

State agencies are barred from awarding contracts to companies that have donated more than $300 to gubernatorial candidates, state and county political parties and legislative leadership committees.

Kevin Pelton: For a guy who spent most of the year in the D-League, Johnson sure looked comfortable on the floor during the playoffs. His lack of strength limits Johnson's ability to contribute regularly, but for a third center, you could do a lot worse. (The Blazers certainly did during the season's first four months.) He's got a spot on the roster.

For one thing, even a huge star like Davy Jones had limited exposure in your everyday life. There's a big difference between hanging a poster in your bedroom and tweeting, YouTubing and Googling your heartthrob's every minute. As massively popular as Jones was, you only saw him once a week on "The Monkees" TV show, or maybe an occasional interview somewhere.
How can Davis combat that? Fortunately for Davis, he is stronger than Hibbert and has a lower center of gravity, so it will be key for him to try and deny Hibbert position close to the hoop and push Hibbert off the blocks.

And there aren't as many farms that still grow garlic, Gilroy's contemporary raison d'être. Some gave it up under pressure from Chinese imports — even garlic can fall victim to globalization — and because of the peculiarities of growing garlic, which drops in quality if it is grown in the same soil more than once every four or five years.

But it's as tough to be right about which market technician to follow or which mutual fund to choose as it is to call the market itself. Every year or so, a different group of stocks is "in fashion." But fashion can change quickly. Last year's most popular stocks can move to the bottom of the list more quickly than your favorite NFL football team. Mutual funds that loaded up on financial stocks in 2011 suffered huge losses, but the banking group has been a winner so far this year. Meanwhile, last year's list of winners was topped by utilities - a much ignored, stodgy group in previous years but one that performed well in 2011 because of the higher and more secure dividend yields that utility stocks offer.
Dogpatch's Jellyfish Art, a 2008 startup, is well positioned to capitalize on the moment and aims to allow those who've been impressed by the creatures in movies, aquarium exhibits or in the wild to purchase them for their homes.

McMillan’s players publicly supported him after the defeat, but it was clear a segment of the locker room had long ago tuned him out or, worse, quit on him.

But the ultimate trajectory of human evolution, notwithstanding the central catalyst of competition and selection, tends toward a cooperative "super organism" capable of governing its actions to preserve its ecosystem (in this case, an entire planet) and thus its survival, Flannery argues. "If competition is evolution's motive force, then the cooperative world is its legacy," he writes.
The move to August was positive for election administrators and absentee voters. But it also has drawbacks. August is a vacation month in Minnesota. While primary turnout in 2010 was in line with the last several September showings at 15.9 percent, it was a less-than-robust democratic exercise.

Since the early 1900s, researchers have experimented with neural bridges, snippets of peripheral nerves borrowed from rats' hind legs. Crushing the peripheral nerve kills its own fibers but preserves a network of revved-up support cells that encourage nearby axons to enter the graft, like a vine snaking down a rain gutter.

The House proposed to cut Medicaid for some Missourians with a visual impairment to balance the budget. When this proposal generated an appropriate outcry of protest, attention turned to children. The Senate is now proposing to balance the budget by cutting funding for child care for very low income working parents, funds to support preschools, and funding for services for children who are in foster care. These proposals deserve the same outcries of protest as the Medicaid cuts for individuals with a visual impairment.

Some 37 percent of people back the protests that have spread from New York to cities across the country and abroad, one of the first snapshots of how the public views the "Occupy Wall Street" movement. A majority of those protest supporters are Democrats, but the anger about politics in general is much more widespread, the poll indicates.
The collaborations yield uneven results, though they also show music as a universal language, with the musicians finding unexpected points of intersections or enthusiastically immersing themselves in unfamiliar genres.

This voice works on all kids, not just your own. Our middle child goes to a cooperative preschool where I'm the teacher helper once a month. Mostly this involves herding the kids around the preschool and providing the snack for the day. I also help police the children during gym and one day I spied a child going to every kid in the class and pushing them down. Without thinking about it, I invoked the Dad Voice, and he stopped in mid push and spun his head around so fast I thought he might have whiplash. We locked eyes from across the gym and, without another word, he knew exactly what he had done wrong and stopped. He also gave me a wide berth for the rest of the day.

Their story is typical of San Francisco's overheated rental market, where well-compensated tech workers are flocking to desirable neighborhoods, driving up prices and locking out those who aren't big earners.

I believe the settlement supported by The Times is profoundly wrong and would be a capitulation to a misinformed jury that was denied all the facts of the case.
