The "minimum coverage" issue centers on Congress' power to regulate commerce. No one disputes that Congress has this power. Putting the power to manage the national economy in one central government was a major reason for creating the U.S. Constitution, and its words give this power to Congress explicitly.

It is an unprecedented decision being made by a reigning two-time Most Valuable Player in his prime."

Tensions had subdued against Native Americans in Arizona had been subdued less than 50 years earlier, and prejudice against them continued in Arizona. Despite laws and court cases establishing citizenship for Indians, states still controlled voting rights. In 1948, the Arizona Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Arizona Constitution that prohibited Indians from voting. Other states followed suit.
And taking up the environmental cause has occasionally been controversial within American evangelicalism. Religious conservatives have argued that the greening of faith could divert attention from "the great moral issues of the day," which they identified as abortion, gay marriage and the teaching of sexual abstinence. But they may have already lost that battle. A Pew poll last year found that 36% of evangelicals say that working to protect the environment is essential to being a good evangelical.
The heart of the home is the kitchen and the breakfast and family rooms, where walls are covered in a buttercup-colored Benjamin Moore wall paint called Westminster Gold. Found throughout the entire first level, the color achieves country warmth, even as it works off the elegance of white molding and trim and the coffered ceiling of the family room. Roman shades decorate the multipaned windows here and in the kitchen. Flooring throughout the main level is maple, a wood that Long loves for its golden finish.

Once the club accrues more talent, it won't be as reliant on Irving's daring, potentially injurious, drives. His ability to hit midrange jumpers as a 19-year-old also bodes well for long-term success and survival. Perhaps some season soon Irving and Wade will meet in the playoffs. It says here the Heat's chance of becoming dynastic hinge more on Wade's health than it does on James locating his fourth-quarter jump shot in June.

Two starters were refreshing and fun. Scallops, seared perfectly, were paired with "noodles" of cucumber shreds in a piquant-sweet Japanese-inspired dressing topped with salmon roe. Beautifully crisped shrimp, briny sweet in contrast to a hint of peppery bite afforded by diced radish, was enhanced by a dash of coconut milk. Herschman's house-cured gravlax can be quite satisfying, too -- but those who dote on salads shouldn't miss the cress and citrus salad with Humboldt Fog, an exquisite ripened goat cheese enhanced by a ribbon of ash through the center, all dressed with a piquant mustard vinaigrette. If you love a great rib-eye, the chef packs on his kosher salt to season it before roasting to order, then lavishes the affair with a foie gras sauce. OMG, indeed. The night's crispy-skin whitefish, fluke, was wonderful, as were the companion lobster dumplings, but our party was divided about an accompanying red chile miso broth with udon. Only the superintense combo of rare tuna and barely seared foie gras, tucked into egg-roll-like spears, left me cold.

"My reasons were as much personal as they were professional. It will be nice to be closer to my folks in Kentucky. And WKRC, like WEWS, is one of those legacy stations with solid news traditions. It was a tough offer to turn down. I fully expect that I will be working my tail off to uphold that tradition."

Mornhinweg, whose roots and connections in Northern California run deep, has been aware of Edwards ever since he went 26-0 as a starter his last two seasons at Los Gatos High, and signed with Stanford as maybe the top QB prospect in the country in 2001. Mornhinweg is reluctant to dissect the ups and downs of Edwards’ pro career from afar, but he notes there was a coaching change in Buffalo, from Dick Jauron to Chan Gailey.

House Minority Leader John Boehner says it's a state issue and, well, it has 70 percent support in Arizona. Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) is "sympathetic." Florida Senate candidate Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American and rising conservative star, has major "concerns." Lindsey Graham says it might not be constitutional anyway�and so does former Rep.

Everyone pays attention to the scoop of whipped El Rey chocolate ganache served with four "toppings'' ($7.95). Whether they appreciate it or not is another story. It's a strange dessert and leads to the same type of guilty pleasure that comes from eating spoonfuls of gooey frosting as you're icing a cake. Diners take a spoon of ganache and then dip it into crushed ginger, pistachio brittle, freeze-dried bananas or Spanish almonds.

Critics of the minimum wage argue that it's really just a subsidy for teenagers, but Schmitt and his colleague Janelle Jones have documented that the average age of workers making $10 or less per hour is 35 years old and that the share of minimum-wage workers who are teens dropped from 26 percent in 1979 to 12 percent in 2011. Some critics argue that the wage shouldn't be raised when unemployment remains high. But pervasive low incomes, like high unemployment rates, reduce Americans' purchasing power and retard economic recovery.
Rabbi Zerach Greenfield, a broker and scribe who shuttles between New York and Israel, counters that it is no big deal to produce a light, readable scroll.

First, the world will change dramatically in the coming decade or two. For example, I wrote part of this piece on my laptop while sitting in a Starbucks and occasionally cruising the Internet and checking Twitter on my iPhone. When I graduated from college those 20 years ago, we didn't yet have a Starbucks in Indiana. We didn't have Twitter or iPhones, and most of us didn't have laptops or access to the Internet. The world didn't have many things back then that we now take for granted: You couldn't pause live TV, for instance. Mobile phones were both a rarity and the size of a cucumber. Justin Bieber did not exist.

As health-care costs continue to soar, reaching $2.5 trillion in the U.S. in 2009, medical societies are becoming more open to self-scrutiny for fear that the federal government and private health insurers will make medical decisions for them.

I find inspiration in the natural world in general, but the patterns and colors in plants draw me to plants specifically. I grew up in Massachusetts and Hawaii, locales where succulents weren't prominent. When I moved to California, succulents had more prominence, and I was amazed by their forms and the vivid colors they came in; I thought succulents were otherworldly. Also, while many kinds of plants do not seem exceptional when they are not in flower, succulents are fascinating all year long.

When Carole Glauser bought a modest house in Kirkwood in 2000, it was not the home of her dreams. The mid-century modern ranch isolated the cook in a closed-off kitchen, and the living and dining rooms lacked flow. Carole enjoys cooking and entertaining, but after some years felt that she could do neither with ease and efficiency in the space. Still, she knew the house had potential. It took more than a year and a half from concept to completion and more than $200,000 for the renovation, but she recently moved back into a home she loves. "My goal was to create a contemporary Craftsman."

Hanger steak ordered rare arrives medium rare and lacks flavor, despite a watercress gremolata, which is a lovely idea, in fact. Grilled pork tenderloin topped with a khaki-colored chimichurri is dried-out. And the Moroccan-inspired rack of lamb rubbed with chermoula may be the most tasteless piece of meat I've encountered for $38. Brussels sprouts glazed with maple seems off kilter — you get that cabbage funk sweetened. Why?

Early reviews for "The Avengers" movie are in, and the adaptation of comic book super-heroes appears to promise non-stop action, surrounding sub-plots of intrugue. I always considered the Marvel grab bag as B-list superheroes, trailing well behind Batman and Superman. But the group, which includes Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor and Captain America, has developed into movie powerhouse. Here are excerpts from some reviews of the movie, which will be widely released Friday.
There had been raunchy comedies before. But "Knocked Up" founded a subgenre by tweaking an old fable so that the frog was now a slobby man-child, the princess a sophisticated woman who transforms him into an adult.

For example: One of the 10 experiments studied the effects of meth on the offspring of mice. If the study discovered that meth-mice moms raised super-genius baby mice that were walking around on their hind legs after a week and correcting people's erroneous Shakespeare quotations after a month, that would be good to know. Especially if you busted a meth lab and the guy said he was doing it on orders from a 6-foot-tall talking mouse who wore pants and spoke three languages. Today, we'd think he was imagining things. And the mouse goes free.

Ghaleb's food still shines brightly. Spread out on the plate like a purple carpet, the finely minced beet salad ($6.50) is seasoned with lots of black pepper, crunchy bits of fresh parsley, lemon juice and olive oil.

There in the Garden of Gethsemane Jesus prayed. There he wrestled with the reality that was soon to engulf him. There he acknowledged that he would be falsely accused and convicted, bound and beaten, mocked and ridiculed, nailed to a Roman cross and crucified. There he travailed in such intensity that small capillaries ruptured and drops of blood co-mingled with the sweat on his brow. There in Gethsemane his internal tumult was quieted as he accepted the will of the Father to pay the penalty for the sins of mankind.

“This substantially increased the drag on the ball, which made it slow down even more. This enabled the sideways Magnus force, which was bending the ball towards the goal, to come even more into effect. Assuming that the amount of spin had not decayed too much, then the drag coefficient increased. This introduced an even larger sideways force and caused the ball to bend further. Finally, as the ball slowed, the bend became more exaggerated still (possibly due to the increase in the lift coefficient) until it hit the back of the net — much to the delight of the physicists in the crowd.”

Excerpt: Most telling has been the noticeable slowing down in performances in the crucial mountain stages. Taken in isolation, a single performance tells little about the state of doping — there are simply too many factors, like wind, race situation, rider preparation and injury, that influence performance to prove that the sport is cleaner based on one climb alone. But the trend toward slower performances has, to date, been universal, so much so that the finishing climbs in the 2010 and 2011 Tours de France have been substantially slower than those of the 1990s and the 2000s, some by many minutes.

Chicagoans love their lakefront, a magnet for cyclists, runners and dog-walkers. You don't need to do anything, though, but put on a pair of comfortable shoes. The lake isn't hard to find; it's where you don't see any buildings. That uninterrupted vista invites you to take a stroll, with your eyes on the water and your feet on the long, long path. It empties you out, in the best sense, releasing the stress of day-to-day urban life in whatever urb you consider your own. It frees up your mind for a thrilling night at the theater.

A. Tying up the leaves is going to give you a bunch of leaf lettuce but not the head of lettuce you are looking for. Good head lettuce starts with the right variety, like Great Lakes, most commonly found in the seed racks at garden centers. Then you need to start the seeds during the cooler weather. Now should be a good time for lettuce of all types. Keep the plantings moist and feed every 3 to 4 weeks. The plantings know what to do and won't need assistance to form the heads but it will take about 90 days to get a head of lettuce.
Speaking for the industry, Stuart Ingis, general counsel for the Digital Advertising Alliance, said the decision to adopt do-not-track is an "evolution" of the industry's approach.

A descendant of wild cabbage, kale has been cultivated for 2,000 years in the Mediterranean region, where it was the most widely eaten green vegetable until the Middle Ages. Also known as borecole, kale stood out for its ability to grow during winter, making it a staple crop in places like Scotland, where every kitchen had a "kail pot" for cooking. With the exception of kale's role in Southern cooking, this green leafy vegetable has mainly been featured as a garnish for other foods, enhancing them with its fancy ruffled leaves. But these days, kale is often featured on the plate, recognized for its flavor and nutritious benefits.

Aware of her trauma, my dad swiftly reached into his giant tourist sack, pulled out our video camera, and began filming.

Colbert set out to prove how flimsy the campaign-finance limits have become since the Supreme Court's Citizens United ruling, and the super PAC he created is egregious enough, allowing contributions of any size.

"Our traveling rule we've been discussing for a couple of years," he said. "The game has evolved. I don't think the rule has evolved since the time of Bob Cousy. But we're also going to probably share it with the NCAA and maybe FIBA, because it would be nice if we could all come up with a similar rule. A similar rule would be great for the players, the coaches, and the officials."

"It's great to come into a game, regardless, but to come into a game where we're at home and we've secured a win already makes it a lot more enjoyable. It's awesome to be able to come back, and great for our team to have such a win. We haven't scored a lot of goals, so to have all that in one night is awesome."

You will occasionally be wowed by a crafty and surprising plot twist. Like a dominating half of football in the Superdome. Or a nine-point lead over the Saints with possession of the ball and only 12 minutes to the never-before-reached plateau of 3-0.
"Sometimes things happen for a reason and you have to take advantage of it and go out and see what you can do on your own," said Olson, 56. "Part of it is having enough belief in yourself and seeing that I have an opportunity to do something different. It wasn't chasing a dream that I always wanted to work for myself. But when the opportunity presented itself it made a lot of sense."
Ackerman was helplessly hooked.
Brown's claim that "If you're looking for frugality, I'm your man," is supported by his history. His tightfistedness during his governorship did not make him popular within the Capitol and helped build the $5 billion surplus that led to the tax revolt by Californians who didn't like the state holding onto more money than it needed.

Former County Chairwoman Linda Peters was recently denied a spot on the county's Citizen Advisory Committee to update the county's transportation plan. "Although transportation planners are making more use than ever of public input and advice, the appointing of citizen advisors to the Transportation Plan Update was controversial," said Peters. "If I understood correctly what I heard in a Work Session, any one commissioner could veto an applicant recommended by his or her Citizen Participation Organization or the Committee for Citizen Involvement. On other advisory committees, long-time members exercising their rights of appeal and/or independent voting have been replaced for obscure reasons. The Chair admits that he wants advisory committee members to communicate privately with him, and to vote as the board majority desires."

The accident was the second in the past year where a car fell off the same stretch of the Bronx River Parkway. Last June, the driver of a sport utility vehicle heading north lost control and the SUV hit a divider, bounced through two lanes of traffic and fell 20 feet over a guardrail, landing on a pickup truck in a parking lot. The two people in the SUV were injured.

Once Jordan's struggles are weighed equally with his triumphs, a clearer, more human portrait comes into focus. The framed jerseys that hang from the ceiling, from Laney High to the Washington Wizards, were earned, not given. The six championship rings encased in plexi-glass — frequently cited as plain evidence of Jordan's status as the greatest of all time — were won with heart, not with a calculator. The indelible image of Jordan clutching his first Larry O'Brien trophy like a Newborn baby, displayed above his first ring, suggests an outpouring of tear-infused joy that could only be brought upon by a tortuous pain. If anything is to be taken away from the soon-to-be-disbanded exhibit, it is that being "like Mike" means accepting and confronting the reality of human frailty.
But food is what I call one of the last affordable luxuries. For many people, that $40 they're paying per week in gas maybe impacts their spending in other ways vs. food.

4. The Lakers had a sluggish start. Bynum's excuse: an upper respiratory infection. Everyone else's rationale: it's a Sunday afternoon game. So instead of replicating the crisp ball movement and disciplined defense the Lakers showed in wins against San Antonio and Denver, the Lakers featured the exact opposite. They rushed shots, resulting in poor first-quarter shooting marks for Bynum (one for eight), Gasol (0 for 3) and World Peace (0 for 3). The Lakers looked lifeless on their defensive rotations. Jason Kidd blew by Sessions on the slowest drive to the basket known to man. West looked like an All-Star by scoring 12 of his 20 points in the first quarter.

KEY IMAGES: The year 2008 flashes across the screen followed by a series of grim images from that year: People waiting in line with pained looks, maps of homes being foreclosed and news footage from the stock market crash. The date 2008 stays in the corner of the screen as each image is shown, emphasizing that the nation's economic tumult started before President Barack Obama took office.

In the end, the last best hope for stopping Iran's dominance of the region may be a Republican victory in 2012 -- and a new administration with guts enough to stand by Israel and to work out a new strategy for dealing with Iran, nukes or no nukes.

10. Walt Michaels, LB, 1951, 7/86, Washington & Lee, 1952-61. We're including Michaels even though the Browns traded him to Green Bay during his rookie season training camp.

“First of all, I think life is too short,” Richt said.. “I want every young man to have a successful time in his four- or five-year window to be able to go to college. So I don’t want to impede a guy from realizing his goals and his dreams, wherever it is.
"We just did not play our ballgame today," Rams coach Rob Garrett said. "We just had one of those days. It happens. We've got a very, very young squad with only four seniors, so you're gonna have those ups and downs. Unfortunately, we caught a good team on one of those downs."
The Rangers had just rallied from a one-run deficit to tie it in the ninth off Blue Jays closer Francisco Cordero.

The contract is expected to go before the board Wednesday.
That said, there is one point on which Yehoshua has here in America an important and indefatigable ally. No one in our community has been more persistent, even obsessive, about the centrality of the Hebrew language to a serious Jewish capacity than has Leon Wieseltier. "The assumption of American Jewry that it can do without a Jewish language is an arrogance without precedent in Jewish history. And this illiteracy, I suggest, will leave American Judaism and American Jewishness forever crippled and scandalously thin... Without Hebrew, the Jewish tradition will not disappear entirely in America, but most of it will." In saying this, as he so often does, Wieseltier is not stating a value-based claim; he is making an empirical prediction, and that claim cannot casually be dismissed.
Or maybe there's a miracle in the making.
Gov. Rick Snyder brought a message to the people of Detroit on Wednesday. It was the same message he has been delivering from Lansing, throughout the state and, last week, from Germany: He has no desire to manage Detroit.
In fact, in its sneaky way, "Composer" is as good an introduction to the instruments and their functions as "Peter and the Wolf" or "The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra." It throws in a few words about composers, too ("Schubert ... unfinished, but dead. Schoenberg ... incomprehensible, but dead.").

"It is neat," Walsh said. "You look at some of the schools that are on that list and it's kind of like, which of these is not like the other. But it is neat for our schools and neat for our kids.

The city spent $732,000 last year to sweep 17 neighborhoods and to operate leaf depots, where people could drop off excess leaves for a nominal fee, $1 a carload or $5 a truck. Clearing leaves keeps streets safe and prevents drains from backing up.
Reinhardt co-authored a Harvard Business School case study of Patagonia in 2010. Like many of the other business-school professors I spoke with about Patagonia, he seemed genuinely impressed by Chouinard. Which is logical: In one sense, Patagonia's current success stems from classic business-school principles. The brand has maximized what B-school types refer to as WTP, or willingness to pay. Patagonia's perceived quality and do-gooder aura convince customers that its goods are worth a higher price.
His peers became American icons: Mathias, who won the decathlon in 1948 and ’52, went to Hollywood and landed in the halls of Congress; Johnson, who won the gold in 1960, went to Hollywood and landed inside the Kennedy family’s inner circle.

The Theory of Planned Behavior — also known as TPB — is an influential psychological model that makes the fairly obvious point that most human behavior is goal-oriented. It was developed in 1985 by University of Massachusetts psychologist Icek Ajzen, who explained that intention is generated by two things: your attitude toward the particular behavior, and the subjective norm.

Born in Alabama in 1913, Owens moved to Cleveland with his family at the age of 9 and came to prominence in track first in the Cleveland area and later at Ohio State. His stunning early success was no match for the racism of the time; at Ohio State, for example, he and other black athletes were not allowed to live in the men's dorm.
How does this relate to dining? We had time to research Bernini only a few hours after learning that we would be in San Francisco at Albona restaurant Friday night with Franco Mormando.

Now it is Rawlings-Blake who has to worry about pulling off a major event under great scrutiny.
Last year, Congress raised the hourly minimum wage for the first time in 10 years. That increase -- from $5.15 to $7.25 -- is implemented in increments over a three-year period. By next July, a full-time minimum-wage earner will gross a whopping $15,080 a year. That's before taxes and usually without health care.
Yet, while shark attacks have been sensationalized over the years by the media and entertainment industry, in reality, such events are quite rare. In fact, on average, fewer than four fatal attacks have occurred annually worldwide since 2001, according to researchers at the University of Florida.

Worst case scenario: Masterson, the Indians' top strikeout pitcher last season, gets traded back to Boston. Or Masterson, who issued more walks than any Indians pitcher last year, doesn't get traded back to Boston. It depends.
The Establishment shrieks like a banshee army about Paul, because he's raising some serious questions about America's foreign crusades. Historically, Ohio, especially the Ohio that flanks Interstate 75, from Cincinnati to Toledo, was isolationist.
There's a subversive notion brewing in the run-up to tomorrow's Illinois primary. President Barack Obama has no opponent. The top of the Democratic ticket is a snore. So lifelong Democrats in our blue state are ginning up trouble.

But the state's ever-growing budget problems were allowed to fester amid political paralysis. It didn't help that the newly elevated Gov. Quinn just didn't seem up to the task.
The president's push to pass the Dream Act, a law that would have created a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants enrolled in college or enlisted in the military, was defeated in the Senate in December.

Opponents of the initiative are spending a lot of time and, no doubt, a fair amount of money trying to make Consumer Watchdog the issue. In addition to the CAHHC's efforts, a site called ConsumerWatchdogWatch sprang up this year to attack the group (as a secretive front for "special interests") and Proposition 103. The site is sponsored by Forza Communications, a Sacramento firm run by Steven Maviglio, but Maviglio has declined to say who's funding the effort. Evidently, Maviglio shares the CAHHC's tin ear for irony.
• Shaq Thompson commits to Huskies -- Greg Biggins, ESPN.com: Last week, Thompson met with Arik Armstead (Elk Grove, Calif./Pleasant Grove) and the two made a pact to play their college ball together. Oregon was the choice for both, and Thompson even went out and bought a Ducks hat and engraved his name on it. Shortly afterward, Thompson thought more about his decision and decided that Washington was a better fit. He let Armstead know and then took an unofficial visit over the weekend to Seattle. Just one more look was all it took for the talented safety and the Huskies landed what could arguably be their biggest recruit in years.
Analysts who are generally upbeat about the market's prospects for the fourth quarter say the pattern is likely to hold: Bad news will hit the market, reminding investors of the economy's fragility, and stocks will slide. But within a few days, or even the same day, they'll recover as investors grab hold of the fact that no one expects the recovery, or stocks, to have an unbroken path upward.

McArthur later changed his mind to a degree: "... in the early days Dr. John Griswold was a prominent resident of Helix, and, at a community meeting, told the audience that about the time the post office was established one of his patients developed a very sore ear and had to be taken to Pendleton for treatment. ... During a consultation with another doctor in Pendleton, the word helix was mentioned, and the sick man (most likely Henderson) thought it would be a fine name for the proposed office."
During the penalty phase of a capital murder case, juries are instructed that it is their "primary duty and responsibility to fix the punishment" but if they are "unable to decide or agree upon the punishment, the court will fix the defendant's punishment at death or at imprisonment for life by the Department of Corrections without eligibility for probation or parole."

Since taking office 15 months ago, little has come easy for Jerry Brown. Love may be lovelier the second time round, as the song goes, but not so for a governor returning to a job he held 28 years prior. California's labor market won't fully recover until 2016. Lawmakers are balking at his proposed spending cuts and second-guessing his slimmed-down budget for high-speed rail. Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the poster boy for tamed hair and untamed restlessness, claims the governor, whose job he covets, lacks a "vision for greatness."

Others were more direct. At a Nov. 10 hearing, one shipping company executive told the commission: "If you want to run my business, buy me out and take me over and you try to get more productivity out of the port."
The details: We admit we're suckers for the subtle, high-acid charms of Burgundy's 2008s - both red and white. As the ripe 2009s arrive, some of them showing enough precision to taste right, some just overwhelmed by ripe fruit, reach back to the 2008s still lingering on shelves. There's something eminently affordable and drinkable, like the 2008 Charles Audoin Cuvee Marie Ragonneau Marsannay ($33, 13% alcohol, Martine's Wines), but you could always go large with the subtle, musky 2008 Domaine de Montille Pommard Pezerolles Premier Cru ($95, 13%, Beaune Imports), which always tastes more like Etienne de Montille's home village of Volnay than leathery Pommard. Any which way, these are a chance to pick up a proper slice of ageable Burgundy without paying the premium. (For more, go to: sfg.ly/l4zsKy)

A hand grinder is a much smaller tool you can store unassembled in a drawer or cupboard, taking it out when you need a few cups of flour. It's a kick to use, in a "Little House on the Prairie" way, but it does require some strength to operate (a plus is that it will tone your upper arms). It also may become a favorite family activity; any kids in the vicinity will want to help out when you start turning the handle.
The 32-year-old Peoria woman had just returned from visiting family in Arkansas when she went missing on July 21, 1989. Rerun, her miniature dachshund, also was gone.

So the Rams, who have played one of the league's toughest schedules, almost certainly would draft behind Cleveland, Jacksonville and Tampa Bay if any of those teams finished 4-12 and the Rams upset the Steelers and 49ers to finish 4-12.
The French playwright Pierre Beaumarchais wrote three plays featuring the character of Figaro: The Barber of Seville, The Marriage of Figaro and The Guilty Mother. Mozart's librettist, Lorenzo da Ponte, based his libretto for Mozart's opera on the second play in the trilogy.

Enter Zoltan Barbu, a charismatic exiled émigré whose novel, "Fire Watch," years ago had brought him renown, an essay in the New York Review of Books by Susan Sontag and residencies at literary retreats. Now 50, he's doing hack work in Hollywood, wondering if he can overcome his writer's block to complete a second novel. As the novel begins, he's dressing for his ex-mistress' funeral. He's broken off the relationship with Maja Stern, a sultry director's assistant -- she's too demanding a distraction -- and he thinks she's committed suicide for spite, leaving him, in the eyes of the second-tier Hollywood circle in which they move, at least partially culpable.

5. The silence you hear is Hawk Harrelson: Let's end on a positive note (at least as it pertains to most Twins fans). The website awfulannouncing.com notes that Harrelson, the White Sox broadcaster with a well-known penchant for being a homer, fell silent for more than a minute after Jhonny Peralta's recent walk-off home run for the Tigers. As noted on the site: "Sound in the booth could have been cut off inexplicably. Microphones may have temporarily disintegrated. I'm sure there are any number of rational explanations for no sound whatsoever emanating from the White Sox broadcast booth."
Researchers also found a trend toward lower cardiovascular deaths in patients taking blood pressure drugs compared to those not taking any, but the reduction was not statistically significant.
Full of sound and fury signifying (at best) educated guesswork, the NFL Draft is three days of numbing minutiae that may be the closest thing in our culture to the tulip mania that afflicted the Dutch in the 1600s. It's a lot of beefy guys in shiny suits striding across a stage for a ritual photograph with Roger Goodell and the instant adoration of fans in a city they may never have seen.
