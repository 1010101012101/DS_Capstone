So, my vision of three large panels up there was dashed, and I quickly tried to revamp my plan. When I got home Kevin helped with the measuring and all that math stuff, and then we got down to the painting. They are drying in the front room tonight, and tomorrow we will figure out how to hang them. I'm actually pretty excited about how it all turned out, fiasco notwithstanding.
So whether we eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many that they may be saved.”

I hope everyone had as wonderful of a holiday as I did. Family, food, and fun abounded. Despite my body’s betrayal of me by developing laryngitis on Wednesday night, I managed to concoct a delicious tiramisu and help Mom put together her cranberry trifle.

“It’s going to be okay!” I shouted. “Take it easy. Leave everything. Let’s just get out of here. Everyone, stay calm!” I tried to calm the situation but found little success against the mounting surge among the passengers that had turned to full panic. People began to realize what had happened. I helped my two boys, Christopher and Jonathan, out from the wires and panels on top of them.
He likes to "sweep" with his little vacuum at any given time, but especially if he sees someone else using the real vacuum. Then he runs and gets his and follows them around. Cute. But this cute little habit has quickly become a weird obsession. He LOVES the real vacuum. If he sees it he goes crazy trying to pull the plug down and start pushing it. I have had to relocate it from its previous spot tucked between a shelf and a wall in the dining room to the mudroom. Oh and he loves brooms. The kid has a serious thing for brooms. He's constantly maneuvering himself around the gate to get into the mudroom to get one of the brooms and then he walks around sweeping. He does a pretty good job, to be honest! Or he tries to get the vacuum. It's a constant struggle with him. I'm pretty sure he wants to be a janitor when he grows up. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm just surprised that he's found his life's calling at 15 months old.

I'm unsure of whether what Spencer told me was the truth or not. I wanted to make sure I understood perfectly what he was telling me and I repeated what he said and even reworded it as I understood it. He agreed that I understood correctly. I'm not sure if he just didn't have a good answer for me so he was told to tell me that or if that really is the truth. I'd like to believe it because that means we still have a chance to book the dining plan.

I have decided that I'm off women too. No, I haven't changed sides, regardless of what some people may think already. I just need much more time to sort myself out - with that in mind I am going to move away for a year. I will still pursue my photography as I really enjoy it and believe there can be a future in it. But I haven't learnt as much as I expected here, so more effort and more like minded people to grow and learn from required.
The other item is the Heritage bundt cake pan. Since I don't have a bundt cake pan, and Tuesdays with Dorie recently made a delectable apple bundt cake that caught my eye, I decided to get the bundt pan to use up my gift cards. Yay! I love new kitchen paraphernalia.

Directions: Fry the onions and ginger - till the onions are slightly caramelized and soft. Add in garlic, carrots, celery, barley and fry to combine. After about 5 minutes, add some water and allow it to simmer for about 10 minutes. When carrots and celery are slightly tender and barley is partially cooked, add the napa cabbage, tomatoes, mushrooms, more water, and simmer low heat about 15 minutes or more till more flavors develop. Salt and pepper to taste.
I think it came out really quite nicely, certainly better than the first, which shows I'm learning: always a good thing. For this one I had a greater variety of needles to choose from, which helped. The first stretch was a bit too loose, in part as the needles were a little large for the yarn, I think. After that, it tightened up quite nicely. I also had a little trouble with the loop for the button, which was smoother than the last, but a bit too long :( Ah, well, can't have everything, right?
Patricia Quintana does just that. In her 2005 book, Mulli: el libro de los moles, she details about a hundred salsas, moles, adobos, and pipianes that draw on Mexico’s culinary history from pre-Colombian times. From the Valle de Toluca (an area west and slightly south of Mexico City), she pulls a roasted tomato table salsa that’s heavily laced with those veins we’re supposed to throw away.

What I did notice, however, was not only the high number of non-Muslims who walked through the exhibition, but also the many school classes. Most of them were made up of very young children, many of whom were eight- or nine-year-old girls in hijab.
In the summer of 1941, fresh out of high school, Zak ventured south to visit his school pal (and relative of mine) Eddie Sudol who was playing his first year of organized ball with the Tarboro Orioles in the Coastal Plain League. This was the bottom rung of the minors at the time and the Tarboro team had recently signed a working agreement with the Baltimore Orioles, an independent minor league team at the time. So anyway, Frankie Zak turns up in Tarboro one hot and humid day, only to find the team in desperate need of a shortstop. Zak, who was almost 6', lean and athletic, looked the part and was quickly signed to a Tarboro contract. It was only temporary, Frankie didn't care for baseball.

Then he would pour himself a coffee and we would banter for a half an hour until just before Dorothie was due down, when he would disappear. I was going through a bad patch at the time and often felt very isolated, so to have someone make me tea and spend time, especially when that someone was tired and had so much to do, was a balm for my soul. It was a small thing but it was huge and made my time in Amsterdam so much easier.
For me, it really doesn't take a lot to make a decent Superman story. Just give me Kal-El flying around and throwing a few super punches, battling a ludicrous super-villain or a giant monster, and I'm good. On that count, the new Superman #1 delivers. The first few pages move quickly to establish the Man of Steel's new post-Flashpoint status quo before getting into the meat of the issue, which is Superman's battle with a giant creature made of living fire.

I’m feeling a bit tired today after driving 599kilometres to Traralgon and back home again to pick up the May issue. I got to spend a couple of hours with my youngest son, Pip, at Yarragon and filled the envelopes as we talked.

“Hey Dean!”, I began cheerfully, after doing a little ‘oops’ maneuver, as if jolted by the vibration of the phone, and putting my phone to my ear as one finger pushed the green button twice thus dialing the last call, “Yeah, I am on my way… no, yes, to meet YOU, yesss, at the parking lot…huh?.. yes, at the parking lot, like I said I would … yes, right now… (using that “duh” tone of voice, which I usually disdain)…
The kids could not play outside (thankfully) and I feel cooped up already. The scraping of the snow, the crunching of the snow - it is just icky!

This is a huuuge sample bottle that I got in a recent Sephora order. This is a pretty standard micellar water, it does not remove eye makeup very well even though it says it can, but it is great on the rest of my face. I have a so many micellear waters that I wouldn't buy this one, but for a freebie it is great. Plus, the bottle will be great to decant other micellars for travel.

For instance, in his 1991 paper titled Why Does Poverty Persist in the Philippines? Facts, Fancies, and Policies, Dynamics of Rural Development: Linkages, Poverty, and Income Distribution, Balisacan argues that focusing on economic growth cannot solve poverty, which he defines as “nothing but a concrete manifestation of gross economic and social inequities.” Instead of focusing on economic growth, he argued that the government should concentrate on “redistributive reforms.”

Then, on the fateful day, it got much worse. The car locked me out. There was no sign of the alarm lights flashing on the door but the locks were definitely on and nothing I pressed on the key made any difference. I even tried the key in the lock, still wouldn't open. Finally it let me in, but the engine wouldn't start, dashboard and everything else completely dead. Opened the door, sprang into life.

I had seen the duck feather early that morning. I just walked past it, though it was quite unusual for me to have done so. Most times, I will pick up a feather that finds it's way into my path. "Oh, it's just a silly duck feather, let it go, you don't have to pick up every feather you see," and I moved on. What I had tossed aside, was the fact that a large quantity of my spiritual messages come through nature, and most assuredly, through Winged Ones. When I parked that boat, successfully, on my way back down, the feather was still there... patiently awaiting my return. I snatched it up and marveled at it's beautiful color... and proudly accepted my very first duck feather... a reward, for myself, from having kept on keeping on, and being aware of the Creator's love and confidence in me, as the Creator has in all creatures and beings which that lovely and omnipotent energy has created.
It was a really productive "unhoarding" day--but not without its struggles. James lamented the computers and worried about people getting personal info off of them--but we worked through it. He set aside a pile of clothes, originally intending to keep them--but I convinced him to donate most of the things. I had trouble parting with an old mini-backpack that was my purse for 2 years in college, so James suggested that we take a picture of me with it (one technique that helps with sentimentalism).
For example, Sutton "ultimately spent 33 years of his 79-year life in prison, but he also successfully escaped prison three times, using elaborate schemes, such as painstakingly sculpting a likeness of his head out of bits of plaster and laying it on his cot so that guards would think he was still safely incarcerated rather than running to freedom."

It is a dense album both thematically and musically*. Even for Gagné, a long-time Genesis fan since the age of 10, in the late seventies, the Lamb, revealed more of its power as he grew more familiar with the music. “It’s a masterpiece. A lot of the songs that I used not to like … I’m a big fan of now, since we play them on stage … like ‘Back in New York City’ I used to not be a fan of because I used to think, ‘I can’t sing that. He’s screaming.’ For a singer, it’s not something you look forward to,” he said and laughed. “But then, when we played the song together, it’s such a strong riff and the whole feeling is really, really awesome. It changed my whole perspective of the song. It’s one of the songs I love to play and that I love to listen to, which was not the case when I was younger.”

Here, a motion to compel, which was granted by the trial court, required Deutsche Bank to provide answers for requests seven, nine, ten, and thirteen of Osorto’s requests for production, and to provide pinpoint cites for the pooling and servicing agreement. If the additional discovery would not yield new information, summary judgment would be proper. The motion to compel required Deutsche Bank to actually answer seven, nine, ten, and thirteen, and to provide Osorto with: any agreement containing any obligation to repurchase the loan; originals or best copies of exhibits attached to the pooling and servicing agreement which affect this loan; originals or best copies of all documents concerning the repurchase or reassignment of the loan from the buyer or assignee back to the original seller or assignor or to any predecessor of the buyer or assignee; and originals or best copies of records concerning the transfer or assignment of the loan.

Cupcakes for Poppy was founded when Louise started making cupcakes for her daughter, Poppy which quickly turned into an obsession and the business was born. They now have a retail store in Crown Street and offer cake decorating classes as well as cakes and decorating supplies. You can friend them of facebook and drool at the creations they make.

What makes this painting particular is it's pure unbiased subject matter. Unlike a scene by Hogarth, there is no witty moral suggestion here nor is the scene enhanced by narratives. Even Watteau's images like these were often riddled with hints of the erotic. De Troy exuded professionalism in his work, and the images of these social scenes are nothing but polite. They are true records of the social life lived by the upper class.

There were only a few instances where the fairies played mischief with me. One was the high G in "Song of the Pucai," which I had practiced over and over and over and was so worried about. I hit the note, but the microphone couldn't handle the pitch and fuzzed out the speakers (how do you like that for a techy explanation). The other was when my new spiral ring I was so proud of flew off my finger and bounced across the floor after we played "King of the Fairies." Both harmless, both added to the mystical, magical, fun quality of the concert.

They are not my children, yet I love them more by each passing day. I endlessly enjoy the time when we are all gathered around the dinner table and I listen to their vivid story telling and laughs, watching them with their father. Their occasional presence in our house brings into my life that joy that was missing in it at all times, that innocent perspective and a fresh outlook. I savour those stolen moments, when I get a glimpse into what could have been, if my destiny wanted otherwise. At times it leaves me with bittersweet tears, but ultimately, it brings my way a sense of endless happiness and the realization that a family comes in all shape and sizes and that our children do not have to be our flesh and blood.

Ryan also elevates her novel by striving to keeping things gray instead of black and white. While Mather does terrible and manipulative things, it’s all out of concern for humanity, her ship’s need for children, and her fear for the girls on the Empyrean. While I was worried after Waverly expressed her distaste for religion, religion isn’t demonized here—Kieran is spiritual, finds comfort in faith, and uses faith to inspire the boys as they try to rescue the girls and some of the adults without much hope. I do wish it had been set up a bit more, but it’s presented as a complex issue. It’s really fantastic to see all of this addressed in young adult fiction without the extremely tired trope of religion being presented as bad. Here, Mather twists it to her own purpose (which only deepens Waverly’s distaste for religion), and Kieran uses it to rebuild the community after the devastating raid.

The word paṇḍitam means learned, and budhāḥ means well-versed. In the Tenth Chapter we also find the word budhāḥ in the verse budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ (Bg. 10.8).

Bhagavad-gītā says that he is a learned man who can see everything on an equal level.

“This peaceful protest exposes the fact that the DSM-5 pushes the mental health industry to medicalize problems that aren’t medical, inevitably leading to over-prescription of psychiatric drugs – including for people experiencing natural human emotions, such as grief and shyness,” said David Oaks, founder and director of MindFreedom International (MFI), which has worked for 26 years as an independent voice of survivors of psychiatric human rights violations. “We call for better ways to help individuals in extreme emotional distress.”

And here's the personal connection, which has stalled me for two weeks. In my own reviews of the Seattle Rep this season I found myself coming back to the nature of truth, and the trustworthiness of those on standing on the boards.Humor Abuse was a one-man memoir. How to Write a New Book for the Bible goes into detail on what happened and what didn't - what was memory and what was nudged one step closer to believability by quoting from the author's diary. I Am My Own Wife deals with the question of an unreliable narrator, yet leaves the audience curiously beached.

Figures for the final quarter of 2011 show unemployment up by 48 000 at 8.4% or 2.67 million – with significant increases in female joblessness being the result of local government cutbacks.
But what stopped me in my tracks were two things: the robes Pope John Paul II wore later in his life, altered shorter in the front to accommodate his very human, stooping posture and the bronze cast of his hand, which attendees were encouraged to touch. Which I did, several times.

Clearly behind the tiny sliver who choose to take a stand, irrespective of the way the wind blows. These men and women risk it all not because of some innate goodness, but because they believe in a small thing such as hope. That standing up for what you believe might, just might, also be politically successful. Sadly, more than often it is not, and they pay for it with their lives.

The bus journey itself is always quite interesting as I love to *people watch* and as if on cue, a large family got on the bus and sat in front of me on the opposite side. It soon became apparent that they were speaking two languages. The first being German or Austrian....... I can't tell which is which and the second English. The two boys and two girls spoke mostly in the Germanic language but the parents answered sometimes in English and sometimes in their native tongue but the children seemed to respond to either. Although both parents spoke excellent English, I did feel that the woman was English. This seems to be the natural way to ensure that the family are bilingual. It takes input from both parents all the time.

There is another special thing about the waiting period; money cannot change it. The working-class guy that saved 38 years to get a Harley Blackline with the black Screamin’ Eagle pipes, the ThunderStar custom wheels, the Sundowner deep bucket seat with the sissy bar, and the HD Orange and Vivid Black tank has to wait two years for it just like the first year lawyer that is buying one with his first annual performance bonus check. If the lawyer shelled out an extra $20,000, all he would get is two bikes with the same two-year waiting period. All men wade through the waters of time at the same rate.

My sister, Stephanie, and my brother-in-law, Robin, were married at an outdoor ceremony on the property of a beautiful log cabin in the Ottawa valley in August 2004.
This match took place slightly more than a year after the historical 1994 Elections in South Africa, and the mood among most whites during that time was rather gloomy. (Nothing has changed much since then!) The question on most people’s minds were, --- “should we stay or should we leave?” Obviously, I was also feeling a little depressed and uncertain about my future in my home country, but when the Springboks defeated the All Blacks 15-12, a rather close call, I couldn’t wait to get back home to my friends and family. Although I was far away in Canada at the time, among strangers we didn’t even know who Mandela was, the 1995 victory boosted my pride in my country and my people. I can recall flying back home about three days later, feeling optimistic that everything was going to work out just fine.
And like I said, I’d suppressed emotions for five years. I know how it’s done. It was surprisingly easy when I gave myself permission to do it. And I trusted myself to release all that when the visit was over.

I was headed home, but, like true friends, they backed me into a corner and made me admit that I had no money and no prospects and insisted on overfeeding me and laughing at all my jokes. They let me be awkward and call me awkward. And still take me to O'Charley's for delicious.

Truth: The truth is that I haven’t been posting lately because I haven’t been dancing a lot lately. Without getting into too much detail I was very ill towards the end of the year (no, I was not contagious). My sickness took a toll on not only my joints but also my eyes. I tried lying to myself saying, “It’s not that bad.” And pressing on through the discomfort but denial is not a good substitute for the truth.

I was greatly inspired by Diane’s new coop. I could imagine both goat and bird living harmoniously in the same structure, with a simple wall between them to keep Lilliput from eating all the grain meant for the chickens. I could even imagine building the coop without it costing us a dime, since the material could be salvaged from our local dump in the Spring. My only real concern was the open front.

The idea of self-definition also comes up in a conversation with a prostitute who the driver gives a lift to one night. Throughout this conversation, the camera remains trained on the driver, never showing the prostitute's face, focusing on the driver's reactions to this other woman's thoughts about her profession. The prostitute seems to think in a way that's surprisingly similar to the driver, advocating independence and freedom from the constricting routines of marriage and monogamy. She's jaded, because she's seen men take phone calls from their wives, sign off with "I love you," and then go to bed with her. As a result, she sees women who tie themselves to a man as foolish, echoing the driver's own advice to a friend who defined herself exclusively in terms of a man, and was devastated when he left her for someone else.

The first things Robert introduced me to in Slovakia was traditional Slovak food and drink. We went to a traditional bar and tried Bryndzone Halusky (a dumpling dish with goat cheese) and drank kofola (slovakian pop). We walked around the old town and I got a Bratislavian crash course. On top of a hill (which includes a castle) overlooking the city, I had my first glimpse of the Danube river. During my stay, I made “american” pancakes for a group of friends. I had a lot of trouble with creating symmetrical pancakes, but they were delicious nevertheless.

According to some, these animals harbour the souls of dead tribesmen, who communicate with their living relatives via the dogs’ yodelling. Moreover, the natives believe that by listening carefully to the specific tones of a given dog, the identity of the dead tribesman speaking with its voice can be instantly recognized. Also, their vocal abilities have inspired an interesting legend in the mythology of Port Moresby’s Motu tribe, claiming that it was these dogs that brought the gift of speech to humanity. And in the vicinity of eastern New Guinea’s Mount Hagen, the native people imitate this creature’s whistling yodels as an effective means of communicating with one another over great distances.

The person knocking is Sophie, who was rightfully annoyed by the letter. After she talked with the girls in the doorway, she comes in for some cupcakes. Caroline tries to connect with her by talking about Max’s work troubles, and then Sophie shares some of her Chanel lip gloss with her. At 3am, the girls hear Sophie blasting music again, so Max bangs the ceiling with a broom and almost breaks it which causes Caroline to declare war. The girls go up to Sophie’s apartment and find a bunch of women in lingerie on couches and a porch swing there. Sophie tells them their “harshing her marshmallow” and tells them she’s talking to the landlord tomorrow. Caroline thinks that Sophie may be a hooker, while Max thinks she’s a Madam.

Shortly after Nora’s diagnosis, my Mom was going through old letters and correspondences that belonged to her mother, my Grandmother. Among them was a letter about my grandmother’s first cousin Fr. Joseph Cappel. He was a Maryknoll priest that served as a missionary in Curepto, Chile from 1943 until his death in 2004 at age 95. By all accounts, he was a humble and incredible man, ministering to the poor and needy in his community by bicycle almost up until the day he died. There were 3 funeral masses said on his behalf just to accommodate his mourners. Recently, for reasons I’m not quite sure, his body was exhumed to be buried in a different location. It was then that it was noted that his body was still perfectly preserved! Many in his community are regarding this as a miracle and are seeking to have him canonized into sainthood — to have him officially recognized by the Vatican as a saint. Part of the canonization process involves documented miracles, as defined by the first definition above. Without any further thought on the matter, we immediately began praying for Fr. Joseph Cappel to intercede on our behalf and on behalf of this little baby! A specific prayer was written out in the letter to put forward when praying for a miracle:
I wasn't the oldest person there (you may read my sidebar and think I'm 41, I was, once, I am now getting on for 45) but where I was sitting everyone was around the 40 age and they all had 4 and 5 year olds. That's lovely, I looked at people's photos and heard all the funny stories but my 19 year old uni costs and my 16 year olds drunk paper rounds aren't really fair to tell, in case they scare easy. Much better for them to think their children still are genii (I can't be arsed to google how to spell it, correct it by yourself) and will never give them a moments worry. I had my children earlier than most people, not quite documentary early but a good decade before the people at dinner. I did feel a bit out of step with the rest.
4. Champions evaluate themselves, their lives and their growth consistently. Nothing happens by accident. Growth must be monitored or it would not occur at all. I’ve learnt to be deliberate about the books I read, the seminars or courses I attend, and determine ahead of time what the take-away would be for me and enforce that personally. What new thing will you be learning? What do you have to re-learn or unlearn? Where are you deficient and need to improve? These are questions you have to answer if you desire meaningful growth.
We did have a few problems with Mr Linky and although with his help and lots of mails back and forth, things seemed to improve with you being able to link up, a few of you still had problems so I can only apologise.

It was in the high 90's and she was panting, so we decided to take a break and get her some water and food. Good thing we picked up a 4-pack of tuna with our groceries.
Hard-to-find working class beers probably grow out of the old days when there were more local brewers who catered to the local working folk. I believe that situation is coming back into vogue in places like Oregon and Colorado and perhaps parts of California. Local working men and women latch onto a particular local brand of beer that’s made by the brewpub or microbrewery in town or just down the road. These are truly working class beers in the original sense. I think where the disconnect comes is when a beer leaves it’s neighborhood and receives wider distributorship; it becomes too much of a novelty in the other places where it’s offered. You can’t be working class, rare and quirky at the same time and (though I’d promised to leave price out of this discussion) you definitely can’t be all those things and expensive.

But God was determined to be with the people again. On Tuesday and Wednesday, we looked at the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus–God in human form. God broke the barrier by making the ultimate blood sacrifice so the people would never again be too unclean or unholy to be present with God. But Jesus’ physical existence on earth–like ours–was only temporary, even after death.
Thanks for your understanding, and I will visit again as soon as I can!!!!!! :)

I think part of it has to do with our complete disengagement with community and family. We live an anonymous existence that allows us to write things on the Internet or hurl insults from a speeding car without any fear of retribution. We are free to air our hurts and hatreds, perhaps hoping that if we spew it from our bodies it will somehow heal us. Sort of like throwing trash on the ground; get rid of it and it’s no longer my problem. But it doesn’t heal, it doesn’t go away, it just gets worse.

I’m really not quite sure. The trigger was that I was going to the Winchester Writers’ Conference and I wanted to enter some of their competitions. I can't remember why, but I decided to have a go at one which asked for the first 500 words and synopsis of a children’s novel. As I jotted down ideas, the voice of Anna (the heroine of ‘Coping with Chloe’) came into my head and started telling me about her twin sister, Chloe. All I could do was write down what she said. I know this probably sounds fanciful, but it really did feel like that. I had no idea, when I started, what the plot was going to be.
Faribault’s connection to the fur trade and Native Americans stretches back to its founding by fur trader Alexander Faribault, the son of a French-Canadian fur trader and a Dakota woman. Faribault traded with Native Americans in the area. Later he would be involved in negotiating land treaties between the government and the Dakota.
Alexandra Reese Manzari was perfect. All ten toes, all ten fingers, big Redding eyes, healthy Tine lungs, seriously strong Manzari muscles, and cute Daddy nose and blue eyes. But most of all, she was all any parent really wants...a totally healthy baby. We were lucky and happy and proud. There is nothing more exciting than creating something as wonderful as a child. The positive pregnancy test...the first time you hear the heart...the first flutter...the the first kick...the first sonogram...the first time you see their face. The journey of having a child is an amazing, incredible gift from God that I feel fortunate enough to have experienced not once, but twice.
Moving into the second and third books, she is forced into hiding for killing the head of a cultish religion, and through mystical events finds herself pregnant. She spends a great many chapters obsessing about Tengo in this place of isolation and establishing that he is the father of this child through some sort of immaculate conception. Aomame, pregnant and in love, in hiding and seclusion, is highly frustrating to read or believe, and it seems to me that there is not a lot of continuity with her personality from before. I suppose this is some sort of representation of a personal transformation underway. I kept trying to draw parallels between her pregnancy and her hiding away as a metaphorical womb, but I found myself largely annoyed with her and her long-winded musings and obsessions. She became not much more than a self obsessed delusional shut-in for a large part of the book.
This guy then turns around and says that he did these things to defend Norway against Marxists and Muslims. Wow! When are people going to let these two groups off the hook? Muslims have been persecuted (along with other groups) since the dark ages, and continue to be the target of stereotyping and discrimination because of a relatively small radicalized few who carry out terrorist attacks in name of Allah (the compassionate, the merciful). Marxists have been the target of right-wing vitriol worldwide, and very specifically in the United States, since the Communist Revolution in 1919, and throughout the 20th century as countries throughout the world tried their hands at communism or socialism (they get lumped in as the same ideology, despite their differences). Although, I must say that all countries that have been described as "communist", have not actually followed through with Marx's vision to the endpoint, and have instead all stagnated in the "dictatorship of the proletariat" stage, with the Communist Party becoming a de facto dictator, with the head of the party as the head of the state (e.g. Chairman Mao, Premier Stalin, President Castro). But I digress...

Chan says that’s how he sees the church today in America. We gather to hear what God would say to us and then we leave and don’t do it. I can think of other similarities. As the players start to run off the field they probably tell the quarterback, “I enjoyed the play call”. (Also known as – I enjoyed the sermon.) But to give the players on the field credit, there are some that don’t even gather in the huddle. Some of them never leave the bench and yet call themselves part of the team. Maybe they come to practice once in a while, maybe they don’t.

As a small aside, in the mid-twentieth century Clement Greenberg helped articulate the theory of medium specificity which is all about syntactic art. Greenberg believed that art cannot truthfully relate anything other than an exploration of the medium it has been made with. This caused films such as Andy Warhol’s Empire, 1964, which is an 8 hour recording of the Empire State Building. Time is specific to the medium of film, which makes this a prime example of syntactic art. A prime example of semantic art would be any landscape or still life or portrait – anything that represents reality.

Another factor that he brought up the importance of letting go of past problems, forgiveness, etc. Whoa! Can we say issues in my face? I have a lot of problems with that exact topic, but it was a rude awakening to forgive and forget. I have to learn to forgive others, so that I can be forgiven.

I tried to make a reservation for your 2 bedroom suite with a lake view (at the Chicago location) to the tune of around a half million dollars and the reservations representative asked me if I knew about your "Gathering policy." Apparently, only the 6 registered guests for the room are the only people allowed to access the room at all. As the room was for a celebration for a friend's wedding and we planned on doing gifts and snacks at the hotel prior to going out for dinner and drinks, I had no choice but to cancel.

I have to say that from a wedding photographer standpoint, Roberts did a great job of the behind-the-scenes perspective of a wedding photographer at a wedding and the post-production process. I was pleasantly surprised that she was very knowledgeable about wedding photographers and the work they do.

Traditional Indian medicines like Ayurveda and Unani prescribe jamun for different health problems including diabetes, dental issues, digestive disorders, liver trouble and skin ailments. While the fruit is rich in antioxidants like tannic and oxalic acids, the bark has digestive properties. The seed is prescribed for diabetes. The seeds of jamun are dried and ground to a powder, strained and consumed in small quantities with water every day to regulate blood sugar levels. The leaves of jamun are said to be natural antibiotic in nature. Jamun seed powder is also used to help in clearing skin blemishes left by acne and blackheads.

He doesn't know that cast iron needs to be heated almost to red heat before welding, and if we wanted to do that up there we'd need to take the roof off. I have another plan, if this one fails, always have a back-up plan...
When I think about the interplay between spirituality and religion, I imagine that religion is the fence, the boundaries that give us freedom to explore true spirituality. Or, in the words of the Psalm, knowing God is the fence, the protective barrier, that allows us to be still. Our son William needed a fence — the bars of his crib — in order to sleep, and those crib bars were good for him. Of course those bars only served their purpose as long as there was a mattress. Without a mattress, crib bars would be a terrible way of forcing him into an incredibly uncomfortable position in which being still was even more impossible than ever before. Religion without spirituality is as uncomfortable and purposeless as a crib with no mattress. But spirituality without religion offers freedom without security. We need to understand how to develop both spirituality and religion, how to be still and how to know God.
Magdi Cristiano Allam gave this opinion. Instead of proclaiming Christ to the Muslims, Europe responds to the phenomenon of Islam which takes religion seriously, with a "reinforced religious relativism" says Allam. This is a "defensive position" which contained "the seeds of a declaration of bankruptcy".

Anyway like I said, things didn’t work out like my daddy planned or like I wanted them to. Instead of being treated like a jewel, I was treated like a brood mare. My birthing hips gave Elkanah a chance to stick his chest out at church and talk about “his boys”. But what did I get for all these stretch marks and now a tree trunk waist…him worrying about his mousey first wife Hannah.
But still, there was a fear that struck a chord in him. He didn’t know if he really knew her, or if she knew him. Were they in love? Had they had a relationship? What if he found her and she did not love him?
Things have progressed in France as well, just over two weeks till we get to see the results. The windows have all been replaced/installed. The boarding between the beams is coming along and the floor in the attic is getting done. New ceiling in the kitchen as well. My goodness it might actually be draft free when we get there.... well except for the large hole that is being made for the staircase!
He also pleaded guilty to Count 2 a common law offence of Misconduct in a Public Office. He was sentenced to six years to be served concurrently with Count 1. The maximum is life imprisonment.
I was very excited to find out that I had a drawing in The Society for Art of Imaginations group show in Vienna. The exhibition was at the magical Phantastenmuseum I knew a number of the artists were attending this exhibition and I decided it would be a great chance to meet up with them. I had never been to Vienna and so it was the perfect opportunity. However, I was in two minds, as I had never left my 6 year old son for more than a night and the thought of not seeing him for a few days was completely heart wrenching to me. I have to admit that I cried on the train to Gatwick just thinking about that. I fought the urge to jump from the train and run home to him and I made it to Vienna. It was late Friday when I arrived and I took the chance to walk around this beautiful city.
Unfortunately, we're human. We're going to sin, we're going to hurt one another, and those closest to you tend to be the ones who hurt you the most. It stings the most when it's inflicted by someone you love. We need to be people who forgive. Not holding grudges or keeping score. We can't neglect proper discipline but we need to discipline and move on releasing them from their "debt". God didn't give us what we deserved, He gave us what we needed. And that is freedom from our sins. Who are we to not forgive others just as we have been forgiven?
Wow! Our birthday came so fast!
The problem is that her argument about literary agencies is based on a misunderstanding of how the publishing business works: and so when you begin to strip it down and look for solutions you get tangled in a maze of assumption and confusion: there is no clear resolution to her problem because (with all due respect to Mary) her argument was flawed.

The situation worsened considerably after the night that Tirumal was taken by a lion. Man eating lion is a very dangerous animal. It is very cunning and shrewd cat. As a result, it became difficult to venture out of the camp even during broad daylight, never mind after dusk. Several bonfires would be lit well before the sun set, with coolies seldom walking away from the fire. The engineer would walk around the camp with his camp, firing blank shots once every hour. Despite all this, a coolie was taken exactly two nights after Tirumal was taken. The following afternoon, a Somali coolie was sent to break rocks within a couple of hundred yards of the camp — he didn’t return that evening.

Next was Linby, with a gorgeous Spring card - flowers, birdies and bugs featured largely - many punched out of such pretty paper. The result is a really fresh and uplifting card and I just love the edges - great stuff Linby! Often it's really funny to read the comments on snippets postings, which is why writing the roll call takes me so long. Mrs A offered to share her sandwiches with Linby if she revealed how the scalloped edges were done! I think it must have been agreed as Mrs A commented later that there were some jam sandwiches left in her lunch box for Linby! I also picked up somewhere that Lyn's dog ate Sarn's homework I think?!
I came to this realisation the other day when I was having a deep chat with a friend of mine. I could see that the majority, if not all of my problems in life are resulting from not being able to live and appreciate the now. I see my mind is living in the future or in the past. This is all a story that is going on in my head. The story of what things will be like in the future….
So. Next step: At least three of these are emenantly doable, so I might as well get on them.

But the biggest win came prior to the end of the meet when Usain Bolt set sail in the 200 meters. Bolt has been running well all season, but not quite in the form that we saw him in last year. Then Tyson Gay made his seasonal sprint debut in May in the 200 meters and since then Bolt has seemed a bit more focused. How focused? Well at Jamaica champs he ran 9.86 to take the world lead and had stated prior to Lausanne that he was looking for a fast time on the friendly Lausanne track - wide turns and a bit of altitude.

Ray Tallis held the influential position of chairman of the Ethics Committee of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) when that organisation went briefly neutral on the issues in 2005. After he had vacated the chair, and just before the debate on Lord Joffe’s Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill in May 2006, the RCP reverted to opposing any change in the law after seeking the opinions of its members, a position it has held ever since.

I am also told that, rarely but occasionally, the sheep with red letters on their wool can stand in an order which accidentally spells out a word.

Before you think I’m a complete pessimist, I should concede that I think it’s possible that people can change. But this kind of change hardly ever happens. The average person will not see a truly changed person in their lifetime. I think that something huge has to happen to inspire change in someone. It needs to be something that alters the fabric of their life so deeply that they completely reevaluate everything. Sadly, I think that some people really believe that they’ve gone through this kind of transformation, only to realize months or even years later that they are back to where they started. It just doesn’t stick.

I am in a quandary as to where I even start in trying to review Has God Spoken? Proof of the Bible's Divine Inspiration by Hank Hanegraff, Host of Bible Answer Man! It is packed with information: external history, Noah's flood, copyist practices, archeology, the dead sea scrolls, prophecies, and so much more--definitely not a light read. Thankfully, the author used acronyms throughout the book to maintain structure and to brace against any wanderings in memory. One of my favorites was L-I-G-H-T-S: Literal Principle, Illumination Principle, Grammatical Principle, Historical Principle, Typology Principle, and Synergy Principle.
So what can I say about bringing back a block chock full of action anime sprinkled with bits of new game reviews and voice work for TOM from the Steve Blum himself? Just that last night will be remembered by many as the night that many ’90s kids watched actual cable programming for the first time in years. Even if this was just a stunt pulled by the guys at Cartoon Network, you could tell that there was a good amount of time and effort put into things, from the choice of episodes to air, to the general mix of all things old and new from the programming block.
This year, for reasons I still can't quite discern, I'm trying my hand at vegetables. For the first time. Ever.
Rachel thanks very much for this award. I really appreciate it, Sweetie!
I love the Herald Sun and it loves me, as can be seen by all the recipes it gives me for foods I don't eat from cooking shows I don't watch, and the articles it shows me about people I neither know nor care about doing things I have never heard about before with other people I know even less about. Since I don't care much what happens in the rest of the world anyway, it really is the paper for me.
In a larger bowl, toss all other ingredients together. Pour dressing over salad and toss. Chill for at least 20 minutes. The recipe says that it makes 4 servings, but I could have eaten the whole thing. I didn’t, but could have.
Feel free to cut the recipe in half. Also, make sure you serve them immediately. They tend to loose thier "crunch" if they sit too long.

In this tale, made infamous by the ‘Identity Crisis’ miniseries of a few years ago, The Secret Society of Super Villains trades bodies with the Justice League. (Fun fact: Floronic Man switches bodies with Wonder Woman! You know he took a peek!) The non-affected Leaguers must corral the villains and switch them all back to their correct forms. The image of both heroes and villains shackled, under the supervision of Hawkman and company is just so dramatic! (But I can’t help myself, I loathed Zatanna’s baby blue jumpsuit!

Henri pulls out his wallet and drops it on the ground. I pull out mine and do the same. He walks to our truck and comes back with passports, birth certificates, social security cards, checkbooks, credit cards and bank cards, and drops them on the ground. All of the documents and materials related to our identities here, all of them forged and manu-factured. I grab from the truck a small gas can we keep for emergencies. I pour the gas over the small pile. My current name is Daniel Jones. My story is that I grew up in California and moved here because of my dad’s job as a computer programmer. Daniel Jones is about to disappear. I light a match and drop it, and the pile ignites. Another one of my lives, gone. As we always do, Henri and I stand and watch the fire. Bye, Daniel, I think, it was nice knowing you. When the fi re burns down, Henri looks over at me.

I don't think I've tried this color combination yet and really had fun with it. I used Splitcoast Stampers sketch #377 for my card layout. I actually made the card body first and matched Bailey to it, backwards but fun. The papers are Via Vellum Basic Black & Violet, Stampin' Up! Pixie Pink, Basic Grey Lime Rickey & Marrakech patterned papers combined. I used the Spellbinders Long Narrow Ovals and Scalloped Ovals dies, a little Stickles covered in Glossy Accents and added a black half pearl to the flower center before it all dried. The Copic markers I used are YG01, YG03, YG63, YG67, RV00, RV02, RV04, E40, E41, E43, E44, Y21, Y26, V12, V15, V17, YR04, YR07, YR09, YR30, YR31. I wanted the background to have a yellowish glow to match the patterned paper so I used YR30 & YR31.
And in the medical establishment, the gears ground the slowest of all, for “Nothing was absolutely conclusive yet,” they said.
When they climbed out on shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish on it and bread. Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish you just caught.” So Simon Peter went over and dragged the net ashore full of one hundred fifty-three large fish. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn. Jesus said to them, “Come, have breakfast.” And none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they realized it was the Lord. Jesus came over and took the bread and gave it to them, and in like manner the fish. This was now the third time Jesus was revealed to his disciples after being raised from the dead.
Boy am I glad I did! Carey really does the 1st person POV well, and Castor’s second adventure/case/torment is a doozy. The cops use him for chasing down perps, his friend Rafi is still possessed by a nasty (possibly the nastiest) demon named Asmodeus and the Doctor’s where he is kept are threatening to throw him out, his apprentice is a soul sucking/eating succubus who he can’t stop desiring, there are people around London committing atrocious acts of violence the likes of which they never would normally do, and Castor’s zombie friend is on edge and looking to kill him. Did I miss anything? Hopefully not. And that’s just the first 50 pages or so. Funnily enough, Castor is approached by a couple who want him to find their lost/kidnapped daughter Abbie…and there is only one problem with that, she’s dead and they want him to find her ghost.
For your hair… Treat your hair with honey and olive oil. Honey is packed with vitamins and has the power to seal in moisture. Before shampooing your hair, add a mixture of honey and extra virgin olive oil to your hair. If the mixture is to sticky to work with add a little more olive oil or some water. Equally distribute mixture throughout hair and then cover with a shower cap for thirty minutes. Rinse out and then shampoo and condition as usual. Hair will be noticeably softer and shinier. This works great with natural hair, especially if you are having trouble with keeping in the moisture.
People had been hearing meowing for days and had finally pinpointed this one area in the roof as the source. Though we were determined to get to the cats, our first few attempts were thwarted by height deficiencies and a lack of supplies. Then T.J. the gymnast scaled a fence, jumped up on the roof, climbed over, lifted up some shingles and pulled out three baby kittens! Such good karma and a great thing we did. After nursing the kittens back to health, we took this inflatable kayak out to the pool and floated around. Then Ali and this Dutch guy Ken took the kayak out into the sea…

As with A Beautiful Mind, we do not realize we are witnessing delusions of Kieran’s mind until late in the story. In retrospect, only one of his three encounters alone with jonas--the one in which he reveals the existence of the resistance--actually was with Jonas. As difficult as it is to create an emotional bond with a one off character, Kieran got to me. Again, it is probably because of my previous attachments to Stockwel because of Quantum Leap and Battlestar Galactica, but he hit all the right marks. Kieran is a pacifist who enjoyed the scientific research, but was horrified by the potential consequences of the bomb he helped build. He created this whole fantasy of a coup that would lead to a lasting peace for his world.
A quote from the article that really intrigued me was how “Innovation never comes from the established institutions… It’s always a graduate student or a crazy person or somebody with a great vision.” That’s true and something that I’ve never really thought about before either. Good ideas usually come from someone who is really driven and passionate about something, like Khan. They don’t come from companies that are just trying to create things to make money and a successful business. The best kind of outcomes are from those who genuinely care like Khan does and who are trying to make a difference. Education is something that the US has been trying to improve and I think this is a great new idea to accomplish that.

Scotland on Sunday had a long piece yesterday titled "The SNP's Drink Problem". This discussed minimum unit pricing of alcohol as a means of limiting binge drinking and associated social problems. There wasn't that much new in it and of course, it was mainly about the internal politicking that accompanies such things. One thing struck me about it though. The current unit price of alcohol - some kind of average I assume - is stated to be 43p for off sales. For cider it is 20p. The unit price over a bar is currently £1.31. I imagine the figures for England and Wales won't differ that much.

Now, if I know someone is a practicing Jew, and if I see them during these eight days of the Festival of Lights, I will joyfully wish them “Happy Hanukkah” because it celebrates what they celebrate. If I had a close friend who celebrated Kwanzaa, I might do the same, but Kwanzaa is not a religious holiday and most of the people who celebrate it also celebrate Christmas. (I tend to think of it as an “insiders” celebration the experience of which would not heightened by an unfamiliar white woman’s well wishes). As for Muslim holidays, since they are set by a lunar calendar, they have yet to get a real toehold in the season: I’m not sure if they even want one but for now our Muslim friends are, greetings-wise, lumped in with the secularists and the Buddhists and Hindis and all the other wonderful souls we have gathered together here in America in the year 2011, united by a love of freedom and a desire to share year-end wishes of goodwill to all.

3) Praise in public, and correct in private.
Sometimes when talking about the Jewish Bible, you have perhaps stumbled on the expressions “Written Torah” and “Oral Torah”. While the written Torah is our Bible, the Oral Torah was an old tradition going back to the time of Moses. The Word was spread from mouth to mouth, because there were no chance to write it down. Later on, from around 200 C.E. the Oral Torah was written down and compiled into something we call Mishnah. And now begins an interesting time in history, where rabbis and scribes wrote down commentaries and discussions that they held between eachother in different kinds of subjects. Mishnah soon expanded in size, so the next few centuries, additional commentaries were written down in Jerusalem and in Babylon. The two “Gemara” of Jerusalem and Babylon was born! Mishnah together with Gemara is called “Talmud”. You’ve probably heard that name before in different contexts, not least in discussions about conspiracy theories and mysticism, but there is nothing mysterious about this!
You can swap out the chicken broth for vegetable broth, water or apple juice. If you go with apple juice, add at least one teaspoon of cider or balsamic vinegar to taste.

We were blessed by a visit from Laurel two weeks ago and one night, she shared with me how she nurtured Grace and Kaylee when they were in her womb. They went through so much together, those three. She said she would just hold her belly on hard nights and talk to the babies about how they were going to get through it and how she loved them. They were going to overcome these hardships together.

.. And a very good friend at Fed Ex. Liz Jenks, who just happens to be an expert on overnight shipping with all things considered hazardous (e.g. dry ice). She helped me box up the pints, add all the right labels and markings, and even drove it over to the Fed Ex office for me. I'm still thanking her for going way above and beyond the call of friendship.
Excuse me, but when our healthcare, our children’s education, our jobs and our environment are threatened by “groupthink,” those of us who want to think outside of the ballot box are focused on making the honest-to-goodness changes we need.
On the other side of the couches would be square wood & brass tables with curvy gold lamps on top. More gold, more modern, more contrast. (I'd have two sets of these, but ran out of room in the picture!)
The title of this post is not, but could be, a slogan befitting the pro-multilingualism campaign of the day. If you do an online search for “being multilingual”, as in the innocent title of this blog, and then count the number of advantage, boost, reward, enhance, benefit, improve, good, opening, and other affirmative-action words that collocate with these two, you’ll see what I mean.
The ‘Beyond…’ category hopes to bring out new visual and conceptual forms of communication and art which catalyse social change while engaging people as something more than mere consumers.
Tuesday, I was bed-ridden. I left my room at 5:15pm to drag myself to Panera for soup along with the rest of my sick housemates (apparently Spring Weekend activities depressed all of our immune systems). Around 7pm I started to feel better and I was hopeful that one more solid night of nyquil sleep would do the trick.
bodies temporarily. He then commanded them to visit their relatives and preach the truth - that Jesus Christ was the salvation of the world. With the darkness and earthquakes too, many people were converted and believed after the Crucifixion. All of this took place roughly 1 hour after Jesus died on the Cross. Yet, the patriarchs, prophets, etc in their bodies did not look like Jesus's glorified bodies. They merely re-entered their bodies temporarily to fulfill the command of Jesus. Afterwards, their souls again left their bodies. On that day, the Limbo
Ginnifer Goodwin’s Academy Award makeup (seen at the top) was, hands-down, some of the most gorgeous of the evening. Not as dramatic and sexy as Angelina Jolie or Milla Jovovich, or smoky and exotic as Penelope Cruz or Victoria Beckham, or metallic as Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Chastain, or Kate Hudson, Ginnifer’s was in class all by itself.

Tomorrow is Grandparents Day for Sweet Pea's class at school. My mom, Slipshod's mom & her hubby will come to the house before school and then I'm going to have them take Sweet Pea over (no reason for me to go, after all, and that will give me a better opportunity to get The Bug napping when her body actually needs it). They get to hang out with her in her classroom for an hour and she gets to show them the works that she does in the classroom, show them the classroom pets, etc. etc. They (Sweet Pea included, of course!) are all very excited and looking forward to their time together at school tomorrow. I'm envious, since I had to miss Mom's Night (when she would have shown me around her classroom & told me all about the works she does during school) in the Fall, due to Sweet Pea being ill. But I have been in the classroom on occasion and have gotten to see some of the neat things they get to do in there.
I greatly apologize not coming to your blog recently. I've been a little headless myself as of late. I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed by this health care fight, and am putting so much emotion into it that it is starting to make me crazy. What a vortex of insanity. Painting has been a wonderful way to escape news, computers, reality, whatever. Anyway, I will be around to your blogs very soon and I thank you for your continued visits to mine.
Shortly after that dream, my wife and I were asked by The Salvation Army to start a “non-traditional” church in East Nashville. We we given permission to be creative and to do church a fresh way. So we set it up where people have the freedom to show and tell what God has done.
So what is it that makes poor drinkers in the north more likely to drink themselves to death than affluent drinkers in the south, who on average drink more? Oh, that's too hard. That might involve addressing the societal, cultural and economic problems that are the REAL reasons some people drink harmfully.

Sadie is a great hunter of Sidewalk Snacks, and she knows that her odds of catching a cheeseburger are greatly improved if she smells like one. If she sniffs at a bag and finds it empty, she knows without a doubt that there is something nearby. She knows what she must do. She rolls on that bag and soaks up those fast food smells and begins the hunt.

Lila although beautiful and the only female villain so far in the six seasons, she had a dark side. Dexter meets Lila in a recovery meeting that he attends in an attempt to cover up his story about framing Rita’s ex-husband and sending back to jail for good. Lila initially comes off as quirky, artsy, and sexy to both Dexter and the viewers, but as the season progresses we come to find out she is an obsessive arsonist, hell bent on having Dexter to herself. Lila doesn’t rack up the body count that some of the other villains do, but she goes after Rita and her kids and takes down the fiery Doakes; all in the name of “protecting” and keeping Dexter. Like all Dexter villains though, she finally meets her match when Dexter hunts her down.
Young William trained to be a solicitor and although he became a partner in a legal practice he had inherited similar interests to his father, particularly in the field of science and engineering. Armstrong gave knowledgeable lectures on these subjects at the Newcastle Lit and Phil and in 1842 he constructed a Hydro Electric generator. This was constructed with the knowledge gained following the accidental discovery of a discharge of static electricity from a colliery boiler by an engineman at a Northumberland coal mine.

gardening; planting seeds of herbs, vegetables, and flowers. This brings me joy and connects me to mother earth, which is a very grounding experience. At a recent workshop I attended, we explored the idea of seeds being planted into the conscious mind by way of intentions where they germinate and later manifest into our desires. Today, I want to explore the various seeds we can plant in our own lives and see what sprouts.
Last year, I took swing dance lessons for two months. The first month, I learned the basic moves of swing dancing in the 100 level class. The second month, I learned that I should have waited until the 200 level class was offered again, and taken it, instead of taking the 300 level. Though I learned a few moves from that class, I never perfected them.
"Cabal of politicians and the self-righteous" doesn't actually say anything useful. You're using buzz words to evoke knee-jerk responses (ie politicians = bad, evil) rather than actually creating an interesting villain. Cardboard cutout stereotypes aren't interesting.
I have been living in a house not too far from Ballinskelligs. When I get up in the morning, there are sheep on the hillside outside with red letters of the alphabet painted on their wool – to show which have been tupped. Some farmers use red, some green, some other colours; and occasionally one farmer’s cheap green dye has been known to run in rain resulting, I am told, in green sheep.
NOW…. with that little introduction into the SLF and the bride side of things, I’m excited to talk to you about the vendor side of things. There is no doubt SLF is wonderful for brides, but it is also an asset to vendors. The group meets once a month and offers the chance to network amongst other local wedding vendors, keep on top of the local bridal trends and give/receive referrals so we can all work together to give our brides the best experience.

March sees the publication of the paperback of Mister Creecher with a new cover. Here is an early version. The actual one will carry some of the nice quotes the hardback has collected.

On the recommendation regarding very well-that means buddies or advisors, people often include a key phrase from the obit announcement for example, “In place of blossoms, efforts might be shipped to…” Certainly, the majority of individuals sincerely value all individual movement involving support and may later on are sorry for possessing an inadequate number of blossoms for the funeral. A far more correct term for many people may very well be, “Together with blooms…” or maybe, “Advantages loved for you to…” Make use of ideal thinking, although remember this “in place of” lingo is often meant to encourage kindly products rather than warn various other expressions. Stylish fellow feeling blooms happen to be proper together with non-profit supplying. Check out that: Funeral directors
Shepard receives a communication call from Hackett telling her that nothing is happening with the Crucible and it must be something on her end. She hobbles over to the module only to black out again. A space elevator emerges from underneath her body and floats up to the ceiling. Shepard comes to and is greeted by what fans have dubbed the “god child.” The god child being declares he’s the Catalyst or the Citadel itself, and the Reapers are his creation. Shepard learns that the Reapers were created in an attempt to keep organic life from wiping out synthetic life every 50,000 years because apparently organics and synthetics are incapable of co-existing together. This mass genocide of races is the god child’s answer to restore order and balance in the galaxy. To be honest, this explanation confused the hell out of me as I tried to follow the conversation going on between my Shepard and this glowing blue kid.
Nonetheless, a white man in a business suit at dusk in a racially tense neighborhood under a national spotlight is wise not to ask too many questions of angry black people on the street. Better to return in broad daylight. But the composite picture from white witnesses about what happened last Saturday night leaves almost no doubt that racial animus played the major role in the vicious beating. Their account, perhaps one-sided but told quietly and with obvious sincerity, follows.
Look at The genealogy of Jesus Christ; it is composed of people who failed God. Yet this is how Jesus came to be born: through this family who failed God. In this family of Jesus’ ancestors are found adulterers, murderers and liars, a prostitute, incest, etc..and God used them.

Baring was born in 1874, the same year as Chesterton and four years after Belloc. A younger son of the first Lord Revelstoke, and an heir to the Baring international banking dynasty, he enjoyed all the trappings of privilege. As a child he was looked after by a succession of nannies and governesses in the sprawling opulence of England's great country manors and the dignified splendor of London townhouses. His autobiography, The Puppet Show of Memory, evokes a world of wealth and cultured comfort, furnished with servants and characterized by a savoir vivre that would be beyond the reach of later generations. It is invaluable as both elegy and eulogy to a dying world and as a testament to a blissfully carefree childhood.
We look forward to the weekly fun!!

In one of the climactic scenes near the end, a house is surrounded by a bunch of SWAT types with long guns equipped with electronic sights, lasers, and probably night vision. The antagonist bursts from the house with a hostage and the SWAT guys let off bullets as if it was a scene in the trenches of WWII. The unbelievable thing was that they didn't seem to hit anything but the bushes around the two characters. The antagonist then runs back inside the house and the SWAT team peppers the door as if now that they can't see him anymore they have a better chance of hitting him. Really stupid. I'm not a great shot and even I can can hit a 1 inch circle at 50 yards with a rifle.
I said in my review of Divergent that it was complex and clever. I also said that you had no idea where things were going to go. Insurgent has both these elements, but takes them to a whole new level. Whereas Divergent focussed on Tris more than the dystopian society, after Erudite put the Dauntless under the attack simulation and all but destroyed the Abnegation faction, Insurgent focuses on both Tris and the society they now all live in. A society filled with chaos, danger, and the threat of war. And in a world where factions are kept separate, you have no idea what any will do, or what the consequences will be. You are constantly sitting on the edge of your seat while reading this book. It just doesn’t stop!

So it was true. We’d heard at home about massive sinkholes appearing in the city, the extensive underground structures succumbing and collapsing from the stress of the disaster and lack of maintenance. But it was hard to verify what was going on in other countries. Communications were patchy and infrequent, mostly word of mouth and rumour. This is what it must have been like before the invention of the telegraph. Even if we had the power, even if the magnetics had been unaffected, the satellites were still falling out of the sky, massive holes punched in them by the infinite debris in orbit, which in turn created even more debris. There was a rumour that the International Space Station was knocked out a couple of months ago and landed in the Kalahari Desert. The Internet and even phones were for now a thing of the past. We didn’t even have the capacity to find the oceanic co-axial cables, let alone restore the connection. Basic messages were carried by those strong enough to travel but that happened sporadically – fuel was precious, travel was rare and messages could take months to get between bases.

Secondary disinfection is necessary because over time water can become recontaminated with bacteria that survived primary disinfection and some usually do. Secondary disinfection keeps bacteria growth minimal/nonexistent.

When I sat down and thought about this startling development, I realized it is because so much of the YA fiction I read these days is gritty, it's edgy, it’s dark – and even if a story ends hopefully and even if it is beautifully written (and most are) there is just so much STUFF going on in the novels that they are enough to make me want to claw my eyes out!
So this pill also can remove arsenic, lead, cadmium and other heavy metals from water and fruit juices, Apblett said, adding that higher-than-expected levels of some of those metals have been reported in the past in certain juices. Nanoparticles composed of metal oxides, various metals combined with oxygen, are the key ingredients in the process. These particles are small enough that hundreds would fit into this period.
Though we’re bombarded more than ever with daily scientific findings, and studies and articles pulling us a million different ways with their logical appeals, I think it’s good to take everything with a grain of salt. Before launching into a new practice just because it sounds right, consider whether it seems correct for you. And similarly, if you’re on a path that makes you feel healthy and well, but then you are confronted by possible evidence that your diet is evil, consider, again, whether this applies to you.

They are abolishing Disability Living Allowance. Sure, they're replacing it with the personal Independent Payment but this is nothing but an excuse to chop the amount of people eligible for it. DLA fraud is estimated at less than 1% of the total. Everyone else is legally entitled to it. But they have said we're 'unsustainable'. Do they have any idea how insulting it is to be told that?
What has also been amazing is the number of writers who have sought me out. Some of them I have tracked down, but some of them just turned up and asked what they could do. That’s always a sign that you are doing something worthwhile.
Sometimes when you move in the prophetic, you obediently release in a poetic or artistic way something of God’s heart for a people, place or situation. However, you don’t always expect to see signs of it in the world around you. So, when you do, it kind of rocks your world.

It’s normal to want to be liked at school and work, to enjoy yourself, have fun with your friends, and to expect a safe environment where people are equally valued and respected. Bullies can stop us from fitting in and feeling safe, and leave us lacking confidence and feeling very much alone.

In the near future there are going to be efforts by both Tom Hanks (HBO series) and Leonardo DiCaprio (a movie) to take on the JFK assassination. Sadly, these are both going to be disinformation efforts; the ONLY legitimate take on the JFK assassination is that it was a full blown coup d’etat. Tom Hanks is a clueless lone nutter.

The Exodar was no exception to the rebuilding process. Even with the position with which it landed, all of it’s nooks and crannies were used to build a working city. Carefully it was divided into districts: one for their Shaman brethren, who had helped them escape from Draenor; one for followers of the Light, central to their people; and one for the traders and the creators, those who could craft and make the items they needed to live, where one could trade their wares for other goods and services. Not to mention the great hall they had put together for their Naaru visitor, with it’s spiral upwards to the inn where most of their allies would stay. Those that lived in the city usually stayed in the living accommodations in the various other tiers, in small nooks and crannies that could serve as more private rooms in the generally open layout of the ship. Or city, as it was now.

Too many of the coopted big environmental groups are buying the industry line that fracked gas is an important “transitional fuel,” cleaner than other fuels like coal and necessary for the U.S to move away from its dependence on foreign oil. (Keep an eye out for people reflexively indoctrinated to use the industry’s “bridge fuel” term.) Gas fracking promoters like T. Boone Pickens have even been seeking government subsidies for the industry on this basis. As such those environmental groups are viewing this as a back-burner matter that must take second place to opposition to such things as the hilltop removal mining of coal.

All alongside the quay (quai in French) are restaurants specialising in moules frites (mussels and chips served with various sauces), and there’s always a menu of the day as well. My favourite is Le Bar Restaurant Le Soleil (30, quai du Général de Gaulle, 04 66 59 28 52), mainly because of the ambiance created by the handsome waiter Olivier Mercier, who's always friendly no matter how busy he is. The daily menu is around €11 for three courses and a large bowl of moules frites costs just €12. But beware: Le Soleil is popular and gets packed on a sunny Sunday lunchtime.
In other news I have had a rather more open conversation with my Dad and it seems like there is a chance for us to meet in the coming months!

Dr. Gideon Fell, the amateur detective in The Three Coffins (British title: The Hollow Man), is, as Dirda observes, “a wheezing, larger-than-life Dickensian figure” (1998, 116). Based on the detective writer, G. K. Chesterton, Fell is an eccentric and colourful figure, a man of gusto and animation. His partner and foil, Superintendent Hadley, is a coolly rational detective who methodically investigates details of the murders.

Mind you, considering that amount of grown men I’ve seen riding around on scooters since Christmas, it’s not all that surprising that some people have taken to mass murder. Seriously, I saw a guy riding a double scooter the other day. It was basically two scooters joined together at one end in a V shape. A double scooter makes you a double twat, it’s a scientific fact. Violence is the only answer in a situation like this.
Mister is currently training for his deployment and I don't have much access to talk to him. It's making me realize how hard this stupid deployment is going to be. There's no way to prepare for them, but little tastes of it scares the crap out of me. Sometimes it makes me wonder if I'm strong enough. If I'll be able to cope with not talking to him. I remind myself though that if God brought me to this, he'll pull me through to the very end. So, I move forward and suck it up - just like all the other men and women out there whose loved one is deployed.

I wasn't around for bedtime once this past week. When morning came Eloise ran to me, hands on hips in full knowitall fashion and was all "Daddy is so much nicer than you. He let us stay up really, really late - because you know I am 7 years old and should be able to stay up late!"

As said before, this past Saturday a weirdly amazing tourney started. 25 points random couples. So 50 points of awesome on each side of the table with the weirdest combinations. Being ten players we made 5 couples and one did not play each round. I didn’t on the first one so only took one battle on the first day. I was paired with Trollbloods with eGrissel and I honestly think it’s the most balanced couple (I brought eSorscha with all weapon master infantry and two Devastators), even though we lost to a sneaky move by my favorite (most hated too) Circle player after killing almost all of his army (eKrueger if I recall?) and his partner’s (some epic Legion warlock girl, I can’t remember who).
Regardless of how, life is able to experience time and distort it. The distortion is evident when a species is young, you may for example, consider when you were in your youth or preteen years. A year seemed to be much longer than a year’s length when you are older. When a baby is born, it’s time is much faster than an adults, rather, it’s working through time is faster this leads me to a new thought—

This morning, while I was shopping and trying to distract myself from wondering about the NXCLEX (the test I took Wednesday), I ran into my old counselor, Tom W., at Trader Joe's. Tom figured in this old post about the terrible Our Lady Of Angels fire here in Chicago in 1958. I had seen him for a while in trying to deal with the double whammy of a divorce and the frustration I was feeling trying to get a teaching job. Now I was running into him as I was getting ready to start a new career-- a response to dealing with the fact that teaching jobs were becoming scarce. I felt it was a good omen.

Many of the court’s rulings have overturned long-standing precedents. While conservatives constantly rail against judges “legislating from the bench,” it is far more common for right-leaning jurists to engage in “judicial activism” than those of a liberal bent. That’s what several studies have concluded. Media Matters offered a run-down of a couple of prominent ones:

It’s a general rule of the product life cycle (PLC) that there is a shallow growth curve of innovators followed swiftly by early adopters and followers. Following that of course is the plateau phase and then either a decline phase or a decline followed by a lower plateau and so on. For subscription/membership products, this is an issue of product management; for single-purchase products, the PLC is a source of stress as alternative products have to be produced constantly to moderate the bumps.

"I too had difficulties finding it in the past, so I ended up writing to the Eur-Lex Helpdesk Publications Office and they sent it to me via email (at the time, the only available version was in Greek...). It is possible that despite my request they have not yet included it in the same webpage where the Greek version can be found, and this may be why the reader could not find it. I therefore attach it to this email so that the reader (and all SPC blog fans) now have it.

I really loved this book. It was at times very difficult to read. When Hassan is assaulted, when Assef beats Amir, when a father commits suicide as they escape from Afghanistan, when there is a public stoning at a sporting event now that the Taliban have taken over…author Khaled Hossein paints a vivid picture that will stick with you even after you’ve finished it.

There are different degrees to this but the key is the removal of legal, financial and technical barriers. There also seems to be emphasis on use of open licences to support this, and it should not involve copyright infringement.

The other remaining PERA bill, HB 1179, has not come up for a vote in the House Finance Committee where it began in January.

Such projected rents, KPMG allowed, were "moderately aggressive," but realistic, given average maximum rents of $43/sf in the three surrounding neighborhoods and the benefits such as proximity to transportation and nearby retail--both mentioned as boosting condo prices, as well. (I pointed out that KPMG did not discount for the presence of an arena and regular nearby construction.)

Leo, who I consider my mentor, is the one who first encouraged me to start DJing. I remember a conversation with him where I asked him how you would evaluate a DJ's performance. He told me that, for a regular milonga, seeing the best dancers pleased would be a good indicator, while for a festival or a workshop milonga the visiting maestros' reactions would be the gauge. At first, this struck me as a very elitist approach, although I didn't say anything. But it's the way I've been DJing since I started. The rationale was that keeping the best dancers on the floor would make others follow suit. Now I really agree with him, that from the perspective of a DJ, at the risk of being perceived as snobby and an elitist, one has to cater to the best dancers' demands (whether or not they're explicit, which in most cases they're not, unlike others...), not the other way around, catering to "the unenlightened masses", who in a way are unenlightened because of a vicious circle started with negligent organizers who are only chasing their share of the pie rather than really promoting tango (although this is arguable, as with all vicious circles... like the chicken and the egg).

They were stripped down to their Propp’s morphology. I tend to think of them as skeletons of stories, but the Provensons remind me that they aren’t dead skeletons so much as a seed bank that any of us can draw on, and that when we do draw on this seed bank, what we are writing (with or without the upscale qualifier literary) is fairy tales.
Where was I? Ah yes, the gentleman wearing a Scram. I'll call him Mr. Smith. So his bond was revoked and he was put back in jail when his Scram showed he'd been drinking just before Christmas. He told his lawyer (a young man I checked with today, and who was too modest to allow me to use his name, so I'll call him Mr. Jones*) that he'd not been drinking. Insisted, in fact, that he'd not been drinking. So, doing his duty, Mr. Jones went before the judge and tried to explain that there'd been a mistake. So the judge, wanting to be fair, had the people responsible for the Scram come into court.

I remembered that cynicism wasn’t helpful; I really had forgotten that. I realised I could carry my cynicism like a useless backpack full of stuff that I would never use. Or I could set it down and unpack it, and discard the things that were damaging and put to work the things that were useful.
The only thing I wish the book had included is an update on the current status of things. Rarely a day goes by when I don’t hear about Juarez in the news, but all of those news reports are related to the cartel-related violence that claims the lives of thousands of people in the city each year. Though that, too, is a narrative that cannot and should not be ignored, it seems that reports of femicide-related news have been subsumed by those related to the drug wars. Because of that last fact, I am all the more grateful that this book was published.
It’s very easy to make a layered fruit salad. you just start with one fruit and build upward. Think of theme though. What colour do you want on top? How do you want it to look as it’s served out? What tastes do you want people to think of? Mine was obviously summer, as you can tell by all the yellow on top. It had the greens and berries below, and built up with the orange through to apricot to pineapple and banana on top. This gave it a summer look and scent. It looked great when served too!

In college things got even worst. I was introduced to a whole new world of spiritual disciplines. For example, routine prayer. My college roommate prayed for at least an hour in his closet every day before any of his days activity. There was fasting. There was intense long sessions of intercession. There was meditative chanting, and exercise, and confession, and service. More and more rituals.

Finally we come to the Fate/ Zero nime, the most recent addition to the Type moon family. This anime only has one episode out right now, and it's in such high quality my laptop has rendering problems (and my laptop plays portal 2, and starcraft 2 perfectly with no lag). In this first episode it's really all exposition, setting up for the rest of the anime which so far has followed the original novel perfectly. I have high hopes for this series, but you really can't base a anime off the first episode.

I use a little more lemon juice than the previous one I made before, just because four lemons gave me this exact amount and I also increased the sugar a bit. Instead of topping it off with Italian meringue like what I did before, I simply pipe some whipped cream on top of it. I don't really prefer the added sweetness from the meringue and I much prefer whipped cream instead, but it all really depends on you. I also brushed some clear glaze on top of it, you can't really see it because of the lighting and the angle probably, but it made the tart shiny!

So when I posted my little rant yesterday, I noticed that all the ages in my profile were wrong. I'm *gulp* 35 now, Supergirl is 9 and Wildman is 5. (We all have Fall birthdays, so we've each had a birthday since my last post.) I just changed them, and it reminded me of this idea from the book The Happiness Project - that the days are long, but the years are short. Incidentally, I really liked The Happiness Project. I had heard of it, but I wouldn't have picked it up except that my local book club chose it as their book for November. What's funny is that I REALLY liked it - like took notes (which I NEVER do), planning my own Happiness Project - liked it. And the rest of the group (y'know, the people who chose to read it), didn't like it. In fact, several of them REALLY disliked it. It's so funny, I like this group, but I am often out-of-step with them. The books they love, I generally dislike, and the books I love, they generally dislike. Oh well, it's still fun to go talk about books.

Cedeno would go on to his best season average with a .320. Willie Davis was mighty upset he wasn't voted on as a starter so it was a nice gesture for Sparky to throw him the bone. His stats deserved it though. And Willie Mays sort of dumbs things down a bit but it was his swan song game and he'd get a little more excitement later in the year. This is a tough one. Davis and Otis are neck-and-neck but I think May gets the nod over Cedeno and the other two AL guys kill the other Willie so I give this one to the AL.

But now that I’ve finished Series 3 of Doctor Who, I’m looking for something quick to watch and review before starting Series 4. I’m watching Spartacus: Blood and Sand, but it’s not really a show that’s worth reviewing every single episode, so I figured I’d hit up a few of the DC animated movies, since I’ve only watched a few of them. That led to putting a bunch of Batman and Superman stuff in the Netflix queue and the 1966 BATMAN movie just seemed like the right thing to watch whilst downing a ridiculous amount of pizza. (If you’re going to give yourself one cheat meal a week, make it worth it.) The fact that I hated it as a kid makes me want to watch it even more now so I can reconsider it. I find I’m always more eager to watch something I used to hate or was indifferent about than something I loved because it’s always a better feeling to reevaluate up rather than down.

College is not an expectation. Because there often isn't that much difference in salary between someone who has gone to college for 4 years and someone who has, many people don't see the point of college if they can simply get a fun job that pays well. This may be changing as the immigrant population increases and takes over entry-level jobs, but for now, college is only something people think about when they want a promotion or certification to practice something that requires a degree.
“Land Acquisition” literally means acquiring of land for some public purpose by government or government agency as authorised by the law from the individual landowner(s) after paying some compensation in lieu of losses occurred to land owner(s) due to surrendering of his/their land to the concerned government agency.

Very few of the migrants I knew in Brazzaville were from Bamako, and these had only formed a mutual aid/self-help association in 2004 — something their peers from rural Mali had done decades earlier. Yet Bamako figures prominently in the lives of Malians abroad. Even those who don’t come from the capital city often return to settle there at the end their migration careers. Many of the biggest homes in this town were and are funded with migrant remittances.

Blogger has been such a pain in the A** lately. I'm not sure how many of you were affected, but I've been having problems logging in to blogger to post a comment.

Think about it. Most parenting books focus on how to get a child to change their behavior, offering rewards or punishments based on a child's ability and willingness to modify who they are to fit parental expectations and requirements. Parenting books are purchased because parents want to control their children, change a child's behavior, change their child's sleep patters, get a child to complete their (often boring, irrelevant, too hard or too easy) homework without complaining, or do more chores around the house with less nagging and effort on the part of the parent. Parenting books are written to meet the desires of the parents who want parenting to be easier, they are not written to meet the needs of children. Generally these books aren't written to show parents how to support their children in blossoming into the amazing person they were born to be, and they generally do the opposite, they instruct parents in how to create children who will some day be 40 and have no clue what it is they love to do. Children who will see a quote on facebook that says, "Don't change so people will like you. Be yourself and the right people will love the real you" and the words will speak to that part of them that was squashed down and hidden away 30 plus years before. And chances are as much as a small voice inside of then says, "Yes, that!" Another small voice will be saying, "But what if I show the world who I am and no one loves the real me?" And that small voice is the child who was shut down, who learned to do what they were told and to be who they were supposed to be so that they were worthy of love, the child who was told that drawing, dancing, taking apart a motor or playing a video game was a waste of time and who became an expert at being who the adults in their life wanted them to be so that they didn't get in trouble and they didn't disappoint. Or maybe they didn't and they were labeled a problem child, strong willed, or perhaps even given a diagnosis and medication to make them be who their parents or the school system wanted them to be. Maybe they lived their childhood feeling ashamed, angry or misunderstood.
I’m not an expert of Greek politics. Even if I had the self discipline I couldn’t read the plethora of party’s various manifestos and policies, and catch up on the latest inside news.

What´s the point of making Maria suffer again and again? If at least she had been killed fighting alongside her lover, but to experience a bit of happiness and then greater loss? That is sheer cruelty.

This whole thing got me thinking, where are these virgins come from? I guess, girls go to heaven just like men. If that the case these girls must be so ugly. Who can stay a virgin until they go to heaven? So there is another reason for me to decline. And again who can deal with seventy to PMS Ladies. I know many highly educated Muslim friends, and I asked them the same question. They also confused, but, I never tried to push this any farther because I did not want to shake their faith. Sometimes it amaze me to see their untamed faith. Their faith is so strong and beautiful, may be that is the reason that religious extremists manipulate them so easy. On the other hand I do question everything. Neither Bible nor Koran can make me believe just because something was written in there. It has to make me understand. It doesn’t mean I don’t believe In God. I do believe in higher power, most people call him God and he had helped me many times. If I do anything in the name of God or religion then, it has to agree with my heart. I am not ready to harm, any living thing just because of someone offered me seventy-two virgins. I mean where is the fun? Having someone hand over seventy-two girls. I like to work for it. I like go to my favorite bar and sit in a corner and stare at the girl I like, not knowing what to do.

Poverty overlaps and relates to the next aesthetic characteristic of hokku — simplicity. We also see simplicity in Onitsura’s verse. The hokku form itself exhibits simplicity. By simplicity we mean that a hokku does not have a flavor of complexity or elaborateness. It is not hard to “get,” and it is very ordinary in its words, which are not fancy or unusual or requiring a special education to understand. Hokku should not seem sophisticated. We should not think of a city dweller going to plays and art galleries and parties; instead we should think of a farmer or of a hermit in the woods, or of a dweller in a simple house with a garden in a small town.

Three spots that helps boost traffic in a record time if done efficiently is Article marketing, Facebook, and twitter. Twitter is almost real-time technology at best. All someone need to do is sign up for a Twitter account for free and begin using there tools. Twitter is basically a social media blog that helps keep individuals updated on what you are doing right now! TweetMe is a great plugin that webmasters use on there publications for there readers to tweet back to there own followers if the story or post intrigues them at best. Use Twitter search to start conversations by giving advice and posting news in the immediate area that you feel is important and once this gets out tweeters are going to check out the excitement spreading.
My son walks to the front, unsure of himself and yet, not afraid of what might be. He is to play middle of the pack. I sit, muscles tight, stomach a ball of tensions. And then, his name is called. He walks quickly to the piano, sits without adjusting the seat and begins to play. I start to relax. He has not forgotten any notes, and for that I am grateful. He will not be disappointed with the silver he receives.

This fun, poppy piano number is a huge departure from the rest of the music I've posted on these lists so far, but the bubbly effervescence of Regina Spektor is the antithesis of summer with friends for me. Maybe it's because I bought the album Far right before Otakon last year, and spent the entire twelve hour round trip drive blasting it out the open windows with one of my closest friends of all time. Either way, Two Birds is a great track that suits days lying on the beach, where sweat sticks sand to your biceps and calves even before you set a single toe in the surf.

A local tradition is ending. Over ten years ago, I twisted the cap off a bottle of Boulevard Unfiltered Wheat and tasted my first craft beer. Many things have changed since then, but the ritual of opening a bottle of Boulevard Wheat or Pale Ale has remained the same. Until now. Boulevard has switched from twist-off to pry-off caps and while it may take some time for this change to work its way through Boulevard's distribution system, some day soon all Boulevard beer will require a bottle opener.
Today was day 3 of 4 for field trips and we found ourselves back in Pittsburgh. We left a bit later today because our morning plan to go to North Country was scrapped.

Bawarchi is a small, vegetarian steam table Indian spot in Culver City where you can get good Indian food at a great price. For a mere $8, you get to choose one of two rices, one of three breads and three main dishes from the steam table, along with a small salad, pappadum and raita. There must be a dozen main dishes to choose from, and they change with some frequency (the labels on the steam table seem to change somewhat less often, so it helps to ask what the dishes are). The day I was there I tried a nice jackfruit dish, paneer in cashew sauce, saag with corn and a lentil dish. All of it was nicely spiced, though not too hot, and tasty. Good food at a great price is hard to beat.

As you can see, I had to do this lesson for two classes, so I just flipped the chart around. Since the new assessments use paraphrasing for summarizing, I changed my method of teaching plot. Before, on the TAKS, students could be taught to find the summary by finding specific sentences within the text. Not anymore. So I teach the students that, in most stories, the beginning of the summary should stop after the problem, the middle should stop after the climax, and the end includes the resolution and conclusion. We used this chart, along with our story, to come up with a summary. I had the students change the first two sentences around in their final copy. Here is our class summary and some examples of student work:

That was me in front of the TV Thursday night when I found out this week’s person of interest was a six-month old girl. I suppose I just wanted to see a POI version of the classic “Who Shot Mr. Burns?” episode of The Simpsons, but instead we got a good, solid episode that continues to apply tension to the bonds that hold our heroic quartet (after this week, I’m including Lionel Fusco) together. Plus, since all this week’s POI can do is eat, sleep, crawl, and crap herself, we get some “Three Men and a Baby” type comedy, as well as a few heartfelt moments out of Uncle Reese and Uncle Finch.
This weekend was my daughter’s last regular season soccer game. It was a very tough game. They were definitely outplayed by their opponents. My daughter Karoline played in the goal for the second half of the game. It was brutal to watch as goal after goal was made. I turned around to look at my husband who always stands behind me and he had disappeared. He had walked down to the end of the field where Karoline was goaltending to offer support. I don’t know if he said anything. He’s a soft spoken guy. But he was there watching, right where his daughter could see him.
There are some debates that seem to have been going from the first time I was aware of contemporary poetry. Where are the black and Asian poets, I wonder? whenever I see a grouping of young poets they seem absent - has marginalisation re-occurred? Or has the relative success of the "performance" poem created its own separate world? Possibly the same goes for explicitly gay and lesbian poets? Then again, the British and Irish poem of the millenial window seems primarily concerned with self, but not in a confessional way, more in the anecdotal or the observational. In a globalised world, one sees poetry that is often as narrow as Larkin's or Heaney's - the flipside being that the narrowness is a trick, that the poem's universality can be found in the localism of subject, as it can be in the poetry of a recluse from Amherst. In terms of form, a certain formal free verse has been de rigeur for so long now, that one is almost surprised when something tighter or looser strays into the pages of "Poetry Review." Then again, now is the first time - in the UK at least - we're seeing poets who have consistently been through the workshopping of the BA or MA programs - often run by that previous generation's poets; a process that started a decade or so earlier with MA fiction courses.

In any case, the show delivered, and it delivered good. I admit that it might not be everyone’s cup of tea (my roommate wasn’t sold.) But I can find very little to complain about. The story lines and scenes are awkward and unapologetic, and they actually talk about things 25 year old women talk about. As much as I love “New Girl,” nothing about the show is realistic or all that relatable (besides the fact that perhaps a lot of us ladies understand her awkward lovability…) So it’s kind of nice to see a show where you aren’t necessarily promised a happy ending, or at least the happy ending is as tenuous and uncertain as all of ours are.

Proposed legislation to allow red light cameras in Connecticut cities with populations of 48,000 or more would impose automated ticketing unequally on the people living in those cities.

Needless to say, November brought a breath of fresh air to our entire family...only four days in and I sense a beautiful seasonal change happening both in the natural weather and in the "spirit". It's a great time of the year to focus on being thankful.
Think about it – January has passed in a daze, with most of us not back at work until at least a week or two in. After work, there’s enough daylight to walk, swim, lie on a beach, catch up with friends – and all the other things we do to pretend we’re still on holidays. Kids are underfoot, the TV is terrible so we’ll do anything to avoid it… life’s good.

I attended Jeanette Winterson's event at The Royal Exchange and reported my impressions here. What else? I went to the cinema and saw We Need to Talk About Kevin, the book of which I have always found hard to get into. I decided it was a hotchpotch of conflicting and half-baked psychological theories - cold mothers create monster children, or maybe they don't, monster children are born like that; macho fathers create monster children, or maybe etc... maybe autism was involved, or maybe not (the doc's test for autism was laughably mistaken, child psych John tells me) - and far too heavy on the blood symbolism which I found as horrifying as the violence they made a point of not showing. I guess I should really read the book now in case the film didn't do it justice.
I bet it won’t take long for them to fight through the crowd, as Cole already starts with the Twitter garbage. How long till Vince discovers Keek and starts using that? I just don’t understand Michael Cole sometimes, he attacks people then calls them a legend, is he supposed to be schizophrenic? We’re a minute in and they’re already using the lead pipe, that’s not a good sign for the match. Didn’t take long for them to wind up in the crowd, as the brawl their way through the fans. No other falls count anywhere match can tough the one between Kevin Sullivan and Chris Benoit from years ago, that was a classic, besides I’d rather have Dusty Rhodes on commentary over Booker or Lawler. Orton is destroying Kane all around the building so far, but Kane fights back and they start up the stairs now. The fight their way to the stage and Orton dropkicks Kane into the metal structure that makes up the entrance. Orton goes for the RKO but Kane shoves him off and Randy runs into a big boot, getting Kane a near fall. Booker claims this match alone is worth the price of admission, well maybe if you’re Orton. Now they’ve fought their way into the backstage area and we see lots of people just standing around, and Orton tosses Kane though a door. If this was the attitude era that would have been the diva locker room and they would be running around in towels, instead it’s just a room where the non used talent is watching the PPV. If they’re not being used why are they there? Just wondering. Anyways, Kane is attacked by Zack Ryder and Kane grabs him but this allows Orton to hit the backbreaker. Zack has suddenly disappeared as Kane tosses Orton into the conveniently stacked pipes. Now they begin their long journey back to the ring, nice of Randy to agree to go back to the ring with Kane. Orton hits the powerslam and then goes after a steel chair which he drives into the ribs of Kane. Kane gets set up on the table and Orton hits the elevated DDT on the floor, that move just looks so contrived, it exposes the business in a bad way. Kane sends Randy into the steel post and gets another near fall, as Kane throws Randy back in the ring and goes for the flying lariat but Orton crotches him on the top rope. Orton hits a superplex, shades of his dad, but doesn’t get the win after what was his father’s finisher. Orton goes into the stupid dance and goes for the RKO but Kane blocks and chokeslams Orton for a near fall. Kane sets up the chair and goes for the tombstone piledriver on the chair but Orton counters and hits the RKO for the win. 6/10 wasn’t the best brawl but considering who was in the match, was as good as can be done. Their match on RAW was the best of the three match series. Sad that this was falls count anywhere and the match ended in the ring.

There are many ways in our lives that we encounter a personal touch from someone that means so much. Someone remembering our birthday, anniversary, celebrating a graduation, sending a card of well wishes, or a thank you card. This Easter, we experienced that power as 1284 people came to celebrate the risen Lord together! After the services, I had lots of conversations with new folks, and I counted 13 that told me they had been personally invited by someone here at Good Shepherd. All 13 had a very positive experience, and 5 of those 13 mentioned that they would be back this next week for sure, 3 of the 5 asking me about membership. Friends, you need to know, that the power of a personal invitation from you to your extended family, your friends, your co-workers, your acquaintances at school, your neighbors…these invites are our single greatest avenue of making disciples we encounter here at Good Shepherd. Thank you for your desire to invite others into a faith community that desires to know God’s love, and follow him!
Violence is met with diplomacy in an entirely different kind of workplace, as Face to Face traces the story of a young man on trial for assaulting his boss and the out-of-court conflict resolution sessions which constitute a process known as restorative justice. A true ensemble piece based on a play by David Williamson, Face to Face is the first Australian feature for US-based director Michael Rymer since 1995′s AFI Award winning drama Angel Baby. Running a close second for the Audience Award at the Melbourne International Film Festival and doing the rounds of North American festivals, it is currently playing in Australian cinemas and will make its UK debut at Raindance on October 7.
I forgot to mention that last weekend I saw 5 Year Engagement. I probably forgot because it was a large waste of my two hours on a Saturday night.

A few months later, up in Las Vegas both Perry and I found ourselves in Sin City for the Burlesque Hall of Fame Pageant. It's a weekend event filled with fun things to do. One thing was a photo shoot about town. I thought that was the guy whom I had met a few months earlier, but was embarrassed that I still hadn't emailed him back so I never approached him. He was busy snapping away at hot chicks so he paid me no mind - Not that I blame him... The girls of Sweet Soul Burlesque are super hot!! That was the end of that.

The first half or so of this cassette appears to be a cry for help, but I don’t mean this in the sense that anyone or anything needs help. The abstract sounds created by the sub-bass recorder, e-bass, and a mish-mash of indistinguishable electronic trinkets appear to emerge from a deserted electro-acoustic island of sorts. The clicks, bumps, loops, drones, human voices, and bass tones, all underscored for the first ten minutes by a constant state of electronic panic, never seem to reach any grounding or final destination. The first half, in sum, is an uncertain and sparse call composed of choppy SOS signals (sometimes human, sometimes not, but always nature-culture). The first part of the latter half (“half” here is defined simply by time; the piece itself has no obvious starts or stops, never mind halves, quarters, etc.), however, sees these sounds reaching the mainland for the first time, a dark, somewhat hopeful, ambient land/soundscape where the panic subsides, even if temporarily, before a sense of uncertainty takes over again around the 25-minute mark, or around the time when a human joins us again for a few seconds, only to disappear rather unsettlingly.
At Starveall Corner I cross the road and pass a pockmarked decaying beech monolith up which a treecreeper climbs, searching for insects beneath the loose bark. Past High Ashes Farm, the path, at times a flinty track, at others a sandy trail, twists and turns, rollercoasting its way to traverse a series of steep valleys, through a succession of different woodland types. More evidence of flux and regeneration, and new life from decay: long-dead fallen trunks of ancient beeches provide a substrate and sustenance for common polypody ferns; a coupe of recently clear-felled spruce and pine in Pasture Wood, the light that now penetrates to the forest floor stimulates the long-buried seeds of wood-sage, foxglove, birch, Rhododendron and yew, coaxing them into germination and a proliferation of new life.
“April covered for you and told your parents that you went over to her house, so everyone thinks you’re with her, and when I found you this morning. God Gracie you looked horrible.

Some months ago, I was particularly intrigued by this superb, mid 1960s Balenciaga couture coat offered at Holt's. Interestingly, it had been first retailed by Holt Renfrew, the same store selling it now, some 45 years ago. Apart from this fascinating historic detail, the coat in itself is an exemplary piece of Balenciaga, the type that connoisseurs and curators of fashion admire. Typically, in the 40s, 50s, and 60s, a few select pieces of couture were brought in, and promoted by top retailers such as Bergdorf's, Saks, and Neiman-Marcus in the United States, Harrods in London, and Eaton's, Simpson's, Creed's, and Holt Renfrew in Canada. They were often featured in illustrated, full page newspaper ads, and would create an exclusive buzz while demonstrating a trend, colour, or theme for the season that was available in the store's less expensive lines. Sometimes, a couture example was reproduced as ready-to-wear, at a much lower price, but with a certain cachet of having the design reproduced or adapted from an exclusive Paris model.
I read a verse this weekend that I'd like to share:
I hunt, putting myself through great physical and mental strain, for jobs that I usually don’t want. Then I must go before a complete stranger, grovel and humiliate myself, and beg to him, trying to justify my existence, to convince him that I deserve to be alive, to have food, clothing, shelter, health care, and leisure. If the stranger hears my supplications, then I am condemned, for a period, to his particular form of punishment, in which he may grant a few of my requests and provide for a few of my needs.

Across the three districts of Jharkhand—Ranchi, Hazaribagh and Ramgarh—where the pilots are being conducted to test the ease and efficacy of the UID platform for disbursing wages and other welfare payments directly to the beneficiaries, the story repeats itself with minor variations. The attempt by UIDAI, headed by software entrepreneur Nandan Nilekani, is to prove the practical application of its project which has run into criticism on account of its huge costs (estimated at Rs 9,000 crore for collecting the biometrics of 600 million residents) and questions about its utility.
Being a court reporter is perhaps not as glamorous as being an attorney, but if you are interested in a career in the legal field, it may be a practical option for you to consider. Court reporters play an important role in the judicial process, a role that is just as vital as that of the attorney or judge. There are approximately 22,000 court reporters in the United States, and about half of them work for local and state governments. Overall, the employment prospects for the industry are considered to be good.

I have to admit though, that when I was younger, I used to envy the kids who would throw parties in school or invite me and my brother to a restaurant/fastfood for their celebration. I have always wanted to have one too, until I grew up a few more birthdays later. I also started to find it weird to celebrate something that you have always tried to hide or lied about.

I wonder if this is a reference to my first days at the center when I said I would swarm low like a drunk bee and collapse on the floor and sleep for an hour or two. I am tired today like I was then. Tired and hot with sun on my face and my shoulders. I have to clean the kitchen floor before I go to bed. That, and finish sorting through the footage for Kevin and call my darling mother. Tonight I am in my home and my eyes feel dry and red and my even my tongue feels raw. But I am home and all is well.
It was only after she made up her version that I knew what my wool fabric was destined for. I would make another wrap top from Advance 7701, but this time in wool - a kind of kimono cardigan. As a further little twisty turn in the life of this pattern, Steph has now created her very own Kimono Wrap Top pattern using the original vintage pattern as a starting point. Her pattern is available for sale on Craftsy. I can't tell you how happy this makes me!

This is Kiera Stewart's debut, and I am definitely keeping my eye out for whatever she writes next. I'm also maybe secretly hoping the Disney decides to turn this into a Disney Channel Original Movie (or, um, based on a book movie).

It’s the Boba Organic carrier. It offers the necessary back support to last the longest of hikes and heaviest of kiddos. The fabric is soft and smooth and just the perfect medium for the natural baby rubs and caresses as Camden dozes. The craftsmanship is truly beautiful and a testament to how much bang you get for your buck. The carrier runs around $125 but it’s a childhood investment – from 7 pounds to 40 pounds. I also appreciate that the design allows for a single person to load and unload the baby. The Boba has allowed me to feel like this whole two-kid thing is doable – as long as I’m hands free.
Johnny Cash was a master singer of country, folk and gospel music whose sincerity and shared convictions with the common man appealed to a huge group of people. If Cash was a musical Billy Graham, bringing in large numbers of music lovers to his shows, then Dowd right now is just a small time itinerant tent preacher, scuffling to add a few more converts and barely having enough gas money to reach the next town. What Johnny Dowd does have is the storyteller’s gift, and a few more tales of his own still to tell. The circle remains unbroken.

A prior engagement kept me away from Saturday's game; so, I have relied on the first hand accounts of those present at Stoneham Park, on Saturday morning, to piece this report together. Ryan Hurst was first to reply to my text message. He too was unable to play, although his absence, rather unfortunately, was due to an ankle injury he sustained in Wednesday's game with Sporting Bishops Waltham. This meant we were without our first choice centre halve pairing against Wessex League opponents, as Kev Willsher was also missing, having torn a shoulder muscle on Wednesday. Although Hurst's text didn't confirm the final score, it did heavily imply that we had lost: "We battled well, but so many playing out of position." 'But' was very much the operative word, and after some coaxing, Hurst did confirm that we had lost the game 5-2. Although what was rather more telling was that we were three goals down in the opening three minutes.
I'm still a bit iffy with how the bedroom looks, I can't decide if it's because we don't have enough pieces to hang or if we didn't arrange the room properly (we arranged it longways, whereas some friends have said we should have put our bed next to the window and not opposite it). I'll have to get some input from Matt, of course, and my interior designer of a mother. Either way though, I am excited as hell about my new pieces!

I don't know what's wrong with me. I really miss you. I saw you like two days ago and I''m dying here because I want to see you.
If you have trusted Jesus Christ as Savior and have turned your life over to Him, acknowledging Him as Lord over your life, then you can experience God's presence and hear His voice. It takes spending time in His Word, meditating on it, praying over it, and praying about everything that concerns you and to seek His will about those things. I'm also learning to get on my knees before God and just spend time being quiet before Him. It wasn't easy at first, but the more I'm able to do this, the more I'm able to clear my mind of all other voices so I'm listening for only God's. I'm beginning to experience more and more of God's peace and the sense of His Presence with me.

“Why not? Think about it. You don’t even have to tell him. Just have sex and send him on his way with your V-Card.” Meredith said. The wheels started turning in my head. By this point, I was still upset about ending things with Craig. Craig decided that he didn’t want anything long-term with me after realizing that I did. I was stressed out and tired of waiting for “Mr. Right”. And maybe I was being hypocritical considering the idea of having sex with someone I barely knew, but I let the concept of my virginity get out of control. It was something that I was self conscious about. I was constraining myself with rules and I was holding myself back from going with the flow and letting things develop naturally with someone I was seeing. I was too focused on getting to the relationship part of the courtship and guys could just smell my desperation and they would run in the other direction.
The findings of the survey showed a considerable lack of education when it came to understanding the difference between ideal success and failure rates, versus the rates typical as reported in reality.

I mention TV, which is one of my favorite topics to talk about because I really love a lot of shows and if the person isn’t into pop culture, he likely won’t “get my jokes”. I tell him Jersey Shore is one of my guilty pleasures. So, he replies back, “Wanna know a secret about me?” ARE YOU KIDDING, OF COURSE! I can’t wait to hear his secret. What could it be? He’s an internet millionaire? He married? He has three toes? He can tie a cherry stem with his tongue?
All this year I have been preparing my students and those who come to platform, bringing a greater understanding of what is to happen and I will continue to do so guided by all source, and there are many parts to source that are here and helping.

Trust that you do know what you need to know and that all is well.

Television has a hold on football like never before. Sky has led the way, particularly in England, and the fees they pay to clubs in the Barclays FA Premiership are like Monopoly money. The BBC and ITV, to a lesser extent, are also aboard the gravy train and coverage of the national game on the small screen has never been greater. Now we don’t want to go back to the quite ridiculous situation of several decades ago when the Scottish Football Association would prevent terrestrial television channels in Scotland showing a European Cup quarter final live because Albion Rovers were playing East Stirlingshire in a bottom of the league clash and therefore the attendance of three men and a dog might be affected to the extent just the dog turned up. However, a modicum of common sense surely has to be applied here. I seriously doubt if there was anyone in Bucharest on the night of 16 February who would have been torn between going to watch the local team Steaua take on Twente or heading to the pub to watch Hearts taking on St. Johnstone on satellite television.
Tuesday evening we schooled the small course again just to reinforce getting back into the routine. I changed the horizontal x into a low wide oxer though. She was EXCITED to say the least. Klein isn't a horse that rushes but one round she put in a couple really pronounced rushes to a few fences. Hmm...eh I'll let her have those as freebies, she was just being a happy girl. I really had to rebalance her a couple times and get her to focus and she did and still didn't touch a thing.
Imp, I could sense, was taking apart the teenager’s room, finding CDs and DVDs and holding them up by the window, maybe to see them in the light, as I was with my book. I hadn’t known her to rest in the three days I’d known her. I could almost believe she was one of the capes that didn’t need to sleep, but the theory would have felt a lot more tidy if I could connect it better to one of her powers.

If you have any feed back, or fish that you would like to see, please e-mail me. Currently, I am working from the photos that my husband and I take while we are diving. Looking forward to a vacation in St. Thomas next month. Hope to find new fish to paint!

Traditional Jewish practice requires that the Torah - the Five Books of Moses - be read in public not only on Sabbaths and holidays, but on Mondays and Thursdays as well. To make this task manageable, the Scripture is broken up into fifty-four portions, one for each week of the year. (That’d be by the Hebrew calendar, of course). The Monday-Thursday readings are abbreviated versions of the ones that take place on Saturdays... a sort of teaser.

Real estate investors competing to buy Manhattan apartment buildings have sent prices to record highs as rental demand surges, reducing yields on the properties to the lowest in more than six years. The capitalization rate, a measure of investment return that declines as prices rise, averaged 4.4% for Manhattan multifamily buildings in first three months of this year… ‘It’s the strongest of all asset classes,’ said Doug Harmon, senior managing director at Eastdil Secured LLC… ‘There is still plenty of room to run on rents, and I see absolutely no reason why this action will or should stop anytime soon.’”
what is also frustrating is having shirts, ties and suits that cannot be mixed and matched. It’s limiting your selection at best and a waste of money at worst.
If you’re new to my blog, the IKAN (“I can”) Bowler is an empowerment device for wheelchair users, even power / electric wheelchair users. The IKAN Bowler is sanctioned by the USBC for league and tournament play — bowling with and/or against able-bodied bowlers or fellow IKAN Users. It’s therapeutic, recreational, and a genuine thrill to be able to get a spare or strike for someone who cannot pickup a heavy bowling bowl (i.e. power wheelchair users like me).
Make no mistake dear souls. This does not mean that our Contact with you has been stalled in any way. In fact it hasn’t, and we are still working harder than ever to be with you all on the ground as quickly as we can. We do have to consider your karma, but for the most part many of you are transmuting many of the karmic chains that have kept you bonded to the third dimension. The Light quotient on Earth is ever growing, and soon your collective Light and demand for truth will absolutely see us at your doorsteps.

My worst encounter with wasps came about just after I passed my driving test. I didn't learn to drive til I was 28 as I lived in a big city and the buses service was so good, you didn't need to drive. Then I moved back home after having Cancer and I realised how difficult life was in a smaller town and no car.

From the inception of human thought, mankind has felt a special connection with the sea. There is something about its rhythm and constancy that is both cleansing and reassuring. When we stand at the sea's edge looking into infinity, we know in our hearts that we are part of something much grander and more complex than our individual, day-to-day lives. We hear the surf rise and fall; we watch the tide deposit its gifts and then reclaim them; we see the light rise, then fall, only to rise again — and, like the light, we are born again into each new moment. Perhaps it was best said by Pablo Neruda in the poem quoted at the end of this piece: "Every day on the balcony of the sea, wings open, fire is born, and everything is blue again like morning."

When he took me to the museum he would take me to see are the art he knew I would appreciate in certain times of my life. When I was a ballerina he took me to see the ballet dancers in pastel by Degas. When I was studying the middle ages he took me to see the tapestries of unicorns. And when I was in art school he took me to the modern section to learn to appreciate Pollack and De Kooning. He always had local listings for new shows cut out from the newspaper. In short, my father taught me to love art.

I look for three things in a biography. It has to be interesting. What sets this man or woman apart from the crowd? What makes their lives worthy of a 571 page treatment? If those questions don’t get answered in a chapter or two, I’ll close the book and move to another one.
As the system is set up in a ‘gumshoe’ fashion/flavour and the characters are meant to find the clue which leads them to the next ‘scene’ it is a whole different way of thinking about running a campaign. It is a mystery novel format unlike other systems that will definitely stretch my minds way of thinking.
Where, may I ask, is China Blue heading off to? Why she's on her way to perform an elaborate rape fantasy for one of her regular clients. After punctuating their rough yet awkwardly consensual sex act with some post-coital pleasantries, China displays a sound head for business when she charges ten dollars for the privilege of owning a pair of her blue panties. This exchange of money for used blue panties is a clear indication that China Blue isn't your average whore. It would seem that the blue dress, the platinum blonde wig, and the thick coat of trollop-friendly make-up are all part of a costume she wears on a nightly basis. The identity of the person behind this elaborate facade is a bit of a mystery.

Hers was obviously wishful thinking, but I felt guilty all the same. So I learned to downplay how I was feeling, even if I was miserable. It was better than feeling like a nuisance, even if I wished deep down that it didn't have to be that way.
The next example is MENASOR – I’ll let the pics do the talking….and yes, I own these now! Enjoy…
Snow Woman was very good at five stones. She considered carefully, for she was tempted by the thought of such riches on top of the king’s prize. Anyway, even if she lost, she would gain her heart’s desire to go north, and surely no task could be as difficult as all that. She was young and brave, so she took a deep breath and spoke.

To date, I've just been watching, feeding, handling, and waiting. Not handling the babies mind you - not til they come out of the cage. One breeder told me that they handle the babies at 14 days and 'open the eyes'; not sure why that is as I have not seen it in any of the books. I'll let you know what I find.

There is a road near home that I travel occasionally. It’s a lovely rolling, broken country road peppered with estates and farms on either side and overhung by old maples, oaks, elms and spruces. It’s one of my favourite routes to travel going east-west.
In case others do not find history as interesting and instructive as I do, I think I should at this stage skip forward to late 20th century politics (though, like Macarthur, I shall return) but before I do so, I think I should hand over to A.V. Dicey to tell us about traditional English respect for individual liberty and the concomitant restrictions on the power of the State. Dicey wrote in the late 19th century long before the deliberate deceptions and distortions of political correctness and is of course one of Britain's greatest legal historians. The quote is from The Law Of The Constitution, Third Edition, 1889, pp. 176-179:

So whilst it won't entirely focus on Christmas, it will have little bits added in between. It will also be about the events that have happened in this festive month and other little happenings along the way...
Now if you don’t want to come off that way, just find better ways to word it if you can’t talk. Everyone is busy and if someone reaches out to you, even though they are probably busy too, then you can give them the curiosity of being nice to them. Here’s the main deal, being busy is great and for the most part all of us, so no one gives any thought about that in a real conversation, unless they ask you “How busy you are?” don’t response with you telling them how busy you are. Lets be honest, that’s just rude, so think on that before you response with… “I AM BUSY!” No one cares if you are or not.

I started thinking about best practices today because of an issue that has come to my attention. It appears to me that world language students in the United States are exposed to a wide gamut of teaching methods that represent a broad spectrum of differing philosophical beliefs regarding language teaching and learning. This can cause difficulties for language students as they transfer from school or school, or even from one teacher to another within a single school.

Do not over steam or overcook your fish. When you remove fish from the steamer it should still be a bit translucent at the spine. Just make sure the fish is fresh. You can add a glass of dry white wine or cider to the pot along with a few sprigs of fresh herbs, lemon and onion slices for a more robust steam flavor. If you want, you can also steam vegetables along with your fish by placing the veggies on top. To give your steamed fish that perfect sheen, brush a little amount of heated oil on the fish.
It was built in 1440 by Sir George Crichton, it soon, in 1453, became the property of the crown and remained so for the rest of it's existence. It was strengthened in the 1500s but when Cromwell turned up in 1651, gun power had overtaken the strength of the walls and it fell. After repair it was used as a prison for covenanters. Later during the wars with France it was used for prisoners of war. During the better part of the 19th century it was an arsenal and briefly a barracks again until in 1912 it was turned over to the Office of Works as an ancient monument.

If trust in their male colleagues or allies had eroded, other issues continued to disrupt RG. Race and class proved two of the most difficult to reconcile. Though Riot Grrrls consisted of several ethnicities and races, many women hailed from white, middle class backgrounds. To their credit, fully aware that feminism in 1970s foundered on its inability to address the needs and concerns of working class women and women of color, leaders attempted to broach both subjects at conventions and elsewhere. In general, the efforts failed to truly address the problem. At the first national convention, discussions about race usually collapsed as many white participants resisted being portrayed or described as “oppressors.” “Some of the women of color were angry and getting a very poor response from one or two vocal people in the room,” noted Jessica Miller. (165) Others felt that only so many ramparts could be run by one movement. “We were what we were,” commented May Summer. “We were suburban young girls involved in this predominantly white scene. It wasn’t Riot Grrrl’s responsibility to attract and recruit other people.”
