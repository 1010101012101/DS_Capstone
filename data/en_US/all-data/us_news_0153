This is Thomas, who spoke the truth without self-consciousness, who was willing to admit confusion, pessimism, and despair. And this was now Thomas's truth: "My Lord and my God!" It was the truth that drove him for the rest of his life. Early church writers tell us that Thomas took the gospel to India, successfully launching the church there before being martyred around 72 A.D. That's right: in the end Thomas the doubter did go and die with his Lord.
I was not in the least chilled while playing Frisbee with Lola and Jake a few days ago, but it was 40 degrees at the time. Hardly a stiff challenge for the Antler. But my friend Barb looked a little nippy in her new high-tech-fabric jacket. And the dogs? Hey, they had the best coats of all, but they don't share.
Fickle winds: The Brewers had 16 hits, including four homers, one triple and three doubles, against five Indians pitchers.
The proposal from Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) would surely extend the immigration debate and touch off a states’ rights fight with strong opinions on either side. Should the court uphold Arizona’s SB 1070, Schumer said his proposal would prohibit states from enacting or enforcing their own immigration law penalties unless they are working in concert with the federal government.

And I think there are members of Congress almost as wealthy as those to be targeted, so I assume they are willing to surrender to this ultimatum. I am not rich by any means but willingly give to many needy causes, as do others who have some minimal funds to spare. And I can't condone surrendering money to those who do not earn it.

Still, the perception is misguided. And in the case of the county corruption story, the fact is that whatever errors The Plain Dealer might have made, a blurring of the line between news coverage and the endorsement process was not one of them. Often enough, Dimora, Russo and McFaul were endorsed because their opponents were so weak.

WASHINGTON -- It's a cliche -- but true --that a huge obstacle to a stronger economic recovery is the lack of confidence in a strong recovery. If consumers and businesses were more confident, they would be spending, hiring and lending more freely. Even a slight relaxation might do wonders for the subpar nature of the expansion, highlighted by May's meager 54,000 increase in payroll jobs. Instead, we're deluged with reports suggesting that, because the recession was so deep, it will take many years to regain anything like the pre-crisis prosperity.

Saginaw Bay: This might be the most underrated and overlooked bass fishery in Michigan. Smallmouths and largemouths abound from one end to the other, with the Charity Islands rivaling Ohio's famed Bass Islands in Lake Erie.

It could be significant. Craig has been and will be an impact hitter for the Cardinals.

Fleming allegedly knew about her mother's attempt to sell her then 8-week-old son and wanted some of the money to pay for a new car, authorities say.
-- The dollar rose against the euro, also after being virtually unchanged for most of the day. The euro was down 1.1 cents against the dollar to $1.322 in afternoon trading. Speculation that the Fed won't act typically helps the dollar. When the Fed buys bonds and other debt securities to keep rates low, that limits the returns available to investors who hold the dollar.

Found at most of the bakeries mentioned above, it's also a specialty of Kanemitsu Bakery in Kaunakakai, Molokai, which serves it piping hot starting around 10 p.m. from a back entrance. If you're in Kailua-Kona on Thursdays, you can watch volunteers at the Kona Historical Society use a traditional stone Portuguese oven to bake bread from about 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.; they're sold till 3 p.m. — if the loaves last that long.
That is Dylan's real legacy, the one that matters. Everything else — the early self-mythologizing, his flings with Joan Baez (and later, Jesus), his briefly controversial decision to go electric, the motorcycle accident, the shape-shifting personas — will be the stuff of his obituary and biographies to come, nothing more.

_ Obama instructed the Justice Department in February 2011 to stop enforcing the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages and gives states the right to refuse to recognize such marriages.

Von Hamelin Institute. Of course. I should be paying more attention to this scene, but I'm hypnotized by the big, public school-type clock on Monroe's kitchen wall.

• The Times' Howard Beck remarked on just how Stoudemire's actions returned the franchise to its dysfunctional ways of the last decade: "Two summers ago, he put on a blue 'NYK' cap and boldly declared, “The Knicks are back.” A depressed fan base perked up and dared to believe again. The Knicks were back because he said so... Late Monday night, Stoudemire affirmed the Knicks’ return to dysfunction, without saying a word. His impulsive punch through a plate-glass fire extinguisher door probably ended his season and surely hastened his team’s exit from the playoffs. The Knicks trail the Miami Heat, 2-0."

I thought discipline at the plate was supposed to be the "new Cubs", but I see the same old at bats. Even in games they win, they are swinging and first pitches and seem over-anxious. I know it takes time but there's very little discipline. The pitcher does not even have to throw strikes, they get themselves out with poor swings on poor pitches. In the two games they lost to Washington, especially the first game with Wood pitching, the Nationals took close pitch after close pitch and walked in the tying run. The Cubs hitters would have been up there hacking away into routine outs. Bill Kelley, Sugar Grove, Ill.

Thanks for publishing David Troy's recent commentary regarding the Baltimore Grand Prix ("Secrecy masked Grand Prix's failure," Jan. 4). There are many of us who could not understand why more investigation was not carried out by the media during the long build-up to the race.

Happily, there's an upside to this story: There were some winners -- healthy, tasty, 100 percent whole-grain cereals that kids will eat and you can buy at any grocery store. Oatmeal is the obvious choice. (Just skip flavored instant types; they're sugar fiestas, too.) And there are other good-morning choices that meet both federal guidelines and ours, which are tougher: Cheerios, Mini-Wheats, Shredded Wheat, Grape-Nuts Flakes and, somewhat surprisingly, Kix. Add bananas, berries, raisins, walnuts, diced apples, almonds . . . it's all good.

One must also keep in mind that when we’re crate training a dog we’re not only training the dog to eliminate in a certain place and time, but we’re also training a bladder and colon to hold its contents when the dog starts feeling the need to release itself. Many owners will let their dog out too frequently — some more than 15 to 20 times per day — and wonder why the dog still eliminates in the house. If you don’t train the bladder and colon to hold for longer periods of time you’re teaching the dog to go whenever it starts feeling the need. This can be counter productive to training success.

Coach's comment: "Obviously, he has a lot of athletic talent and that helps him a lot but I think leading into his senior season, he definitely stepped up as a leader. He took a captain's role and he knew that for us to make it that far (in the state tournament), he has to take up more of an off-court and on-court role. . . . I think in that last week (of the state tournament), you pretty much saw him tapping into his potential. He played great when it really mattered for his team and played an amazing championship week." - Katie Higgins.

The impact on his family life, however, has been immeasurable. At Big East media day this summer, I had asked Schiano about having twice as much tenure as all the other league head coaches combined — a statistic many view as a sign of a stagnating career.
A future without limits: Congress and the White House eventually will agree to raise the federal debt ceiling -- and everyone will forget about it until the next time the ceiling's reached and there's an opportunity for one party or the other to grandstand. The ratings agency Moody's has another idea: Why not eliminate the statutory limit on government debt? The firm reports that very few countries have one, let alone any "periodic uncertainty" over the government's ability to pay bills on time. Since the ceiling clearly isn't a brake on government spending, why not end the Kabuki dance (one that then-Sen. Obama participated in when he and other congressional Democrats wanted George W. Bush to make squirm)and look for real tools to enforce fiscal discipline -- if that's what voters really want?

The resume feud is the latest in a long list of fights between the outspoken Farahi and the faculty union, which has clashed with the president for nine years over his efforts to reform the 16,000-student public university.

Bad things happen, followed by worse things, and the pummeling never stops.

Really, I'm not swayed by the fact that Wood Tavern makes one of the best Manhattans in the Bay Area. The drink only warms me up for what's to follow. Chef Max Dimare offers familiar yet stellar offerings on a menu that generally features about seven appetizers and nine main courses. It could be an amazing soup, rich rabbit rillettes or a fish stew with octopus, clams, mussels, black cod and Portuguese sausage in a lobster broth. The place is always crowded, but the staff has adjusted well in the transition from a laid-back neighborhood spot to a white-hot destination.

Game time was 2 p.m. and, having spent four days in Philadelphia, I was eager to go home, so I'd booked myself on a 6:15 flight out, which was pretty much the last flight I could take all day that would get me home. If the game ended at 4 p.m. and the postgame went smoothly, I should make the flight with little trouble. If there was overtime, or if Majerus had a long session with the players afterwards, it could get dicey. It would also be dicey if the weather got messy and the roads got bad. SLU had decided not to chance it and stayed over Saturday night -- they don't travel as lightly as I do, so it takes them a bit longer -- but I felt it worth the risk.

A familiar pattern has the Cardinals squandering early scoring opportunities against vulnerable starting pitchers.

Nudity for me is not an issue. It doesn't scare me at all. I wouldn't ever do full frontal in a film - I'm not that comfortable! The truth is I'm still developing my feelings on nudity and films. But it wasn't an issue for me when playing Linda Lovelace. There are some scenes of simulated sex, but we're not actually re-enacting the actual deep throat scenes. We are re-enacting scenes from "Deep Throat," but not that actual act. I didn't think that was necessary at all.

Ben Roethlisberger still isn’t happy that offensive coordinator Bruce Arians was let go. Big Ben enjoyed his best season in the last five years while Arians was calling plays on offense, but what happens now? Deep target Mike Wallace is a restricted free agent, so it’s likely he’ll be back. Next step will be finding some protection for Roethlisberger on the offensive line.

A: Well, I don’t know, my own view on politics is, I give everybody two terms and then vote for the other one. I voted for Maggie (Thatcher) twice, then voted her out. Same for Tony (Blair). David (Cameron, leader of Britain’s Conservative Party) interested me because he has this organization that’s all about saving the youth from itself, giving them a second chance — and I’ve seen the results, they’re fantastic. So I’m supporting him, but we’ll see. It’s very close, the election. Blimey, we’re all on tenterhooks here. I think we’ll end up with a hung Parliament, actually. Haven’t had one of those for a while.

Linda Wilson: The painted hashed island could be removed so that you have three lanes at the signal between Pershall and the I-270 ramps. I can see your point that it would allow the cars to line up with two lanes for northbound Hanley and then the left lane to start forming for the left turn at Dunn. It's a little more complicated than just removing the paint. We have to adjust the overhead signals and probably some signage. I will have our traffic department look into it if this is possible. I also want to add that we may not be able to have three lanes going northbound because then we can't allow yielding left turns from southbound Hanley onto the eastbound I-270 ramp. All of this will be looked into and I will post an answer hopefully next week.

The show ended — not, as expected, with another Houston tribute — but with Paul McCartney and his band performing a segment of the Beatles’ “Abbey Road” medley. When it came time for the final guitar solos, McCartney, Springsteen, Grohl, Joe Walsh (who had played with McCartney earlier) and the two guitarists in McCartney’s band engaged in an extended — and seemingly spontaneous — guitar jam, adding an emphatic closing note to a show that deserves to be considered one of the most memorable in Grammy history.

Over the years, I've found that older neighborhoods are the best places to find uncommon plants, especially those with edible fruit. I've discovered a wide array of edible and floral displays by driving slowly through lesser-traveled neighborhoods. I've also learned that when politely asked, homeowners are usually kind enough to let me pick my fill of fresh-off-the-tree-or-bush treats.
Locascio also said TMM can pursue its suit for monetary damages against Hale. Her attorney, Jeffrey Pollock of Princeton, argued that because Hale's comments were written, they should be considered by the libel standard, which is harder to prove than the slander standard TMM attorney Joel Kreizman of Ocean Township said applied in this case.

The team has made clear it wants a special session approving the Arden Hills project by the end of this year, but significant hurdles remain.

From China, "The Butcher, the Chef and the Swordsman" is an ambitious, multi-parted epic that follows the journey of a mystical blade through the hands of three different owners.

Stymied by my Goldwater-Republican father, who insisted he would keep on eating what he had always eaten, and my sister, who was threatening vegetarianism just because, my mother had to move carefully. She wanted something new yet familiar, something cheap in case the dish was rejected by the rest of the family, and something easy to make for us if my father insisted on a seared slab of red meat.

After all, no matter how stable a name like Procter & Gamble may sound, you can't compare its 3.1 percent dividend yield to the 1.05 percent interest on a five-year Treasury bond.

Just ask Newt Gingrich. A month ago, his Republican presidential campaign was first in the polls, in Iowa and nationally. Today, it's on life support. One big reason: A barrage of negative ads, mostly paid for by groups linked to his GOP rivals. Super PACs outspent actual candidates 2-1 in Iowa, according to The Washington Post's Dan Eggen. Nominally independent of the candidates, they're able to do the dirty work without, say, Mitt Romney getting mud on his shoes.

"The Little Foxes" is usually perceived as a vehicle for whoever's playing Regina -- the role has attracted powerhouses like Tallulah Bankhead, Stockard Channing and Bette Davis (in the film version). But we have a true ensemble piece here, with some characters reimagined in inspired ways. Birdie, usually portrayed as a faded Southern belle, becomes a vamp in bright-red outfits, abjectly submitting to Oscar's beatings. As Regina's daughter, Cristin Milioti holds her own in a hair-rising final confrontation, while Christopher Evan Welch is affecting as Regina's husband, the play's moral center.

Some scientists suspect that getting stressed out too often can lead to chronic high blood pressure. That's not proved. But whenever blood pressure is higher than it should be, it increases wear and tear on the blood vessels.

Hollie's backward slide continued with a Bonnie Raitt song. "If I had to write a song, I would definitely have to say it would have to be 'I Can't Make You Love Me,'" Hollie said. But watching her perform it, I kept thinking I might like her better if she wished she'd written her best vocal of the season, the Ike & Tina Turner hit, "River Deep -- Mountain High." Tyler thought it fell a little short. And when J.Lo agreed, it sounded like the end of Hollie, which is kind of sad. Her dark-horse power surge has been a joy to watch.

At the novel's center is Nick Bottom, a former cop whose parents must've appreciated Shakespeare. Maybe they had no idea they were naming him after the hapless "Midsummer Night's Dream" character. Nick is a grieving widower and flashback addict (these, by the way, are related). He's been hired to thaw a cold case for Hiroshi Nakamura, a wealthy, powerful Japanese businessman living on an armed Los Angeles hillside area once occupied by the Getty Center. Despite his millions, he's never been able to find out who murdered his documentary filmmaker son Keigo in Denver. Why turn to a miserable, addled detective for help? Because Bottom was involved in the original investigation.

If you're bored at home and need a hobby, take up exercise. I haven't owned a working bicycle since I was about 10 years old. But who needs one? Jogging is a form of exercise that can be an entertaining way to get out of the house without emptying your wallet. It's free, and though daunting at first, it can actually be fun if you give it a chance. It is a great, relaxing way to explore your neighborhood. Run around your local park or find biking trails to jog through. Finding nice running paths is part of the fun, and it's the perfect way to keep you interested in your surroundings, and less focused on the strain of running. Running can also be a group activity, so get your friends involved and run with them.

The story is collaborated by the survivors and the beneficiaries of an experiment, for a better way of life, by a group of predominately Eastern European and Russian Jews with their political “shades of red” philosophy settling into what was a predominately “conservative” Chatham Township.

A: Donald spent the last 12 days of his life at San Diego Hospice. They were magnificent in his care and they prepared me - not an easy task. I found it so helpful to have a small refrigerator in the room. When I commented on it to the head nurse, she told me not all the rooms had them. So I asked her to count the ones that didn't. Think it was 14 or so. So I made a call, ordered the number needed and had them delivered. The reaction was amazing. Such a small thing, but such a helpful one for each of our families.

"I think he made a mistake when he said it wasn't about the money," La Russa said, referring to Pujols' oft-quoted claim in February 2009 that he would stay in St. Louis for millions less per year. "If the Angels had offered the same exact thing he would have gone back to the Cardinals. I think his point was he was ready to sign for less than the best offer. I think he's sincere. I think he was trying to make it work. But you had a club that made an overwhelming offer."

​Ferry Street fixture a suave, stylish gathering place. Portions are huge, and in the Ironbound, that’s saying something. Shrimp in garlic sauce not as good, or garlicky, as Casa Vasca’s version. Mussels in tomato sauce highly recommended. Roasted lamb shank — three mammoth hunks of meat in peppery, tomatoey sauce — is excellent. So is the filet mignon, menacing and meaty. Blackened salmon: sensational. Skip the squid in ink sauce.

"I think the fans carried the tension of something bad is going to happen, and I know what that is like. But man, when we scored that second goal, that roof came right off. Then you saw joy. People an hour later still didn't want to leave the building. That just shows you, to me, where that fan base is at now. I think they can now enjoy hockey rather than live in the disappointment of not getting through first round or even not getting in the playoffs."

But it didn't happen that way, as you've probably guessed. It doesn't really sound like my style, does it? My call has come in a series of fits and starts, through unexpected opportunities and affirmations, and through my own desire to keep putting one foot in front of the other in obedience. And somehow, those steps have led me into a strange new world. It's certainly strange to be taking classes for the first time in 24 years. I'm sorry to say that my self-discipline regarding homework hasn't improved much; I still turn in assignments at the last possible moment. But it's even stranger to be entering what I think of as "Clergy World". By nature or habit, I am contrary and anti-institutional. I'm skeptical of those in power, and have trouble towing the party line (in any party). I keep asking myself, "Can I fit into this world without becoming someone else?" I don't know, honestly. I could fret about whether I'll even get through the first round of interviews for my district license, but what would be the point? Listening to the voice of the Spirit has gotten me this far, and I'll just keep going - one foot in front of the other - unless something stops me. I don't want to ever, ever become someone who gives an answer because I think it's what those in authority want to hear. No king but Jesus. I'm working toward ordination, but ordination is not the ultimate goal. Faithfulness to God is the goal.

In the draft: General manager Martin Mayhew said he values running backs higher than most. "I think it's a critical position," he said. "I don't share that sentiment that running backs aren't important or you just grab one whenever and the guy can play." It might be a reach for the Lions to take a back in the first round, but they hosted potential second-round picks LaMichael James and Lamar Miller and have an interest in Washington's Chris Polk.

-- For tomato-based pasta sauces, the classic pairing is Sangiovese (this works for pizza as well). Tomato sauces are high in acidity and need a wine that will not shy away from that acid. Plenty of Sangiovese-based California wines will embrace pasta sauce. Look for Sangiovese from Altamura and Iron Horse.
