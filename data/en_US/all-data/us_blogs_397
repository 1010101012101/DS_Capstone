I ADORED this book, everything about it just blew me away. There is so much emotion behind the main character, Saffron, that I was whisked away to her world the second I began reading. Not only did I feel her pain, but my heart literally ached for the girl and the unusual situation she had found herself trapped within.
i) I am a guy who is introvert by nature and don't like much to share about myself instead like to listen others.

This Saturday we took a day trip into Fes, and spent the afternoon in the ancient Medina, or old city. We saw a madrasa (pictured above, an old school of Quranic learning), a 900-year old leather tannery, and a carpet factory, pictured below. After being mobbed upon arrival by wannabe tour guides, everyone else we met was incredibly friendly and welcoming. We sampled the street food, pastries, pastillas, and sweetbreads, all ranging from 1-3 dirhams ($0.12-0.36). The medina itself seems like a giant labyrinth, with alleyway after thin alleyway, towering walls, and identical shops on every corner. A Moroccan student served as our guide; without him, we would have been hopelessly lost.

The Neolithic farmer simplified his ecosystem to produce quantities of plants that would grow rapidly on bare ground and would survive grazing animals, and he got exactly what he tried for, but some of them he cursed: tufted vetch, ryegrass, cleavers, thistles, coriander, and others.
Alexander congratulates Cesare and Victor/Vittoria on their subterfuge, but Cesare doesn’t get to celebrate long: Micheletto appears and tells him the French came up by a road that took them past the convent where Ursula was living. The two men race there, but the place has been pretty much laid waste. The nuns have been slaughtered, and their bodies left underneath that recently completed ceiling fresco. Cesare moves past them until he finds Ursula at last and realizes her ear’s been cut off, as have those of many of the other nuns. And now Cesare’s really, really pissed. Man, I wished for an end to this subplot, but I didn’t want this for her. That sucks. Cesare vows vengeance on the French. Micheletto agrees with that because that’s the kind of thing he lives for, and he finds a French flag left carelessly nearby. Cesare tells Micheletto to start gathering up some stray condottieri that they can use to unleash some sweet, sweet asskicking on the French.

The acutely observant may also notice I am wearing what has been recently termed by the fashion cognoscenti as "American tan tights", albeit toe-less ones made for wearing with sandals. These above all else, dear reader, propelled me into the giddy heights of the fashion forward, for tan tights have apparently been rescued from their previous status as a fashion faux pas and declared a new fashion trend for Autumn 2010. And since I effectively travelled back in fashion time to attend a wedding in Spring 2010 my fashion forwardness was amplified even further!

In the many court cases which have taken place since the whistle was finally blown a little more than a decade ago, a number of other teachers gave testimony that they were unaware of what was going on. As far as I can ascertain, Thomas Mooney was not called to testify. Even if he had been, given his detachment and preoccupation with his own problems, I would guess that he would also say that he didn’t know anything. And yet, that visceral part of me which does not always comply with my rational world-view wonders whether the underlying miasma of evil and misery in the school didn’t contribute somehow to his obvious unhappiness.

This next one is for our dear friend Miss Roses. Obviously this is Robert Downey Jr. in a blue suit. I had another photo in which it looked black though. Personally I much prefer black suits to any other colour. White's just tacky and blue is out of place at the Oscars. That said they do look really good together. I assume the woman is his wife. During the red carpet transmissions I was lucky enough to watch a little interview with the two of them in which she was very proud that her ear rings and matching ring was designed by Angelina Jolie. I don't like the jewellery but the dress is lovely.

The most interesting thing about the construction was attaching the neck interfacings to the actual dress instead of to the neck facings themselves. In addition, I stitched a "sleeve facing" to the lower edge of the sleeve then stitched a rayon binding to the sleeve facing. I then slipstitched the binding to the sleeve creating a nice finished hem.

Here's another lead. Notice that the Native American man has a little bit of facial hair. Contrary to popular belief, Native American, particularly those in the Pacific Northwest, did grow facial hair. The facial hair may help to narrow down the tribe of this individual, because it was certainly not typical of all Native Americans. I think it probably narrows it down to the Pacific Northwest Indians. This Edward Curtis photo from the Library of Congress shows a Native American (Old Bob from the Karok tribe) with similar facial hair.

While we were on vacation in Hawaii last month, I found this awesome tool! And I had to buy it! It's meant for making pan sushi, which is basically made of ingredients that you would normally roll up in sushi, but spread out in layers inside a pan instead (and usually made with a layer of furikake instead of nori/seaweed paper), and then cut in squares to serve.
Day 4, bake a cake from stratch. Again, 2 attempts were made. 2nd turned out good, but realized I still forgot an ingredient....no one could tell but me. I can't imagine having NO mixer, NO electric oven, or convenient utensils like we have today.
Speaking after the meeting, the Director General of WIPO, Dr Kamil Idris, welcomed today’s decision on the program and budget for the 2008/09 biennium.

Friday we went for a 6.5 mile bike ride on the Bob Jones trail. We went to Avila Beach and rode the trail backwards. It was more crowded than usual, but not too bad a ride. We planned to go to Port Luis for lunch but when we got back to the car from the ride, the fog had moved in and pretty much ruined the sea view. So we skipped that and hope to squeeze it in next week.
This is quite an amazing looking vehicle; judging from the rear markings, it appears to have been custom built by a military armored vehicle company. I know the TIV 1 is still out there in service; I've seen it this year while chasing. I haven't watched Storm Stories in a while, so I have no idea if this has been worked into the documentary yet, but if not, I suspect that it will. It's quite a strange sight. And as for roads, well...

What I want to do with that shelf eventually is get another silver vase similar (but not the exact same) as the one on the bottom shelf of the other set of shelves in here, and get something white to go on top of the stack of black books.

Now though, let’s not forget that this is a Harry Potter product, so there is some amount of cash cow milking to be done. Following the tour you’re conveniently led into the gift shop, which can be seen as either a blessing or a curse. Hardcore fans will be in heaven, with pretty much anything you could ever want under one roof (Hogwarts robes, replica wands, you name it and they’ve probably got it) – but be warned, it comes with a ridiculously hefty price tag. You could spend a lot of money in this place if you’re not careful! If you desperately want to buy just a little something though, I do suggest trying the Butterbeer they sell halfway through the tour, although even that’s not for everyone. Personally, I found it delicious. Others have deemed it “diabetes in a cup”. Go figure.

In 1960, Dr. Bender launched her first experiments with LSD and children. They were conducted within the Children’s Unit, Creedmoor State Hospital in Queens, New York. The LSD she used was supplied by Dr. Rudolph P. Bircher of the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company. (Dr. Bircher also provided Bender with UML-491, also a Sandoz-produced product, very much like LSD but sometimes “dreamier” in effect and longer lasting.) Her initial group of young subjects consisted of 14 children diagnosed schizophrenic, all under the age of 11. (Because diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, autism, and other disorders have changed over the decades, one cannot assess what actual conditions these children really had.) There were 11 boys and three girls, ranging in age from six to ten years old.

The unravelling story within From The Edge Of The Universe we will leave for your investigation, it is a full journey that needs as much attention and focus as the great sounds surrounding it, and is as rewarding. Journey Within shows the diversity of the release, its pulsating flowing breath an enveloping blend of dark electro, ebm, and industrial manipulation. The vocals take on a harsh gait which takes a short time to find an attachment but also makes a contrasting entity adding depth to the vibrant energy driven sounds.

Well, ya'll all know there is nothing like a moon pie and an RC Cola to take care of a little hunger pain and here is a cute way to decorate a plain old moon pie and make it something special for Halloween! Unwrap your moon pies and insert a 9" wooden dowel into the side, up through the marshmallow middle. I pushed my dowel through, almost to the top. Now you are ready to decorate them. I laid them all out on a sheet of wax paper and used melted chocolate as my glue. I used the back of a spoon as my spatula and applied the melted chocolate all around the outter edge, then sprinkled orange Halloween sprinkles while the chocolate was sticky. It only takes a few minutes for it to harden. After the melted chocolate was hard I turned the moon pies over and shook off the excess sprinkles. I attached candy corn with more melted chocolate, let that harden, packaged them in cellophane bags from AC Moore and tied them with curling ribbon in Halloween colors! These are the cutest little treats! I can't wait to give these to the children that will be coming to have some Halloween fun with me at school on Friday! They will be so surprised! Just let your imagination run with the decorating! I love the banana moon pies too and I think they would be so cute decorated with a monogram! Now you know everyone needs a monogrammed moon pie! Hope ya'll have as much fun making these fun treats as I did! Trick or Treat!!!

We assured him that we couldn't imagine it ruining our lives (we like little people, and are already up at all hours).

This quote and others I have read give a good insight into the reasoning behind Nan Goldin taking self-portraits. Nan One Month after Being Battered is, of course, one of the most famous of Goldin’s photographs and has a very strong narrative behind it. In just one image with Goldin looking straight at the camera, it tells us a lot about what has happened to her, how she feels about it and how she wants to move on from it. My own self-portraits definitely do not have anything this strong behind them, though I am not sure it is always necessary. Goldin it seems though have a very busy and fast moving life, which her other photographs show from being taken in different situations and places all around the world.
Introducing a logo that is so similar to another brand is surely not something we are likely to see happening anytime soon.
I had this really incredible octopus stencil from Coffee Break that I wanted to use and I also had gotten one of the new mustache stencils....and lets face it, I love putting mustaches on animals. I airbrushed it onto a vintage prescription got from Retro Cafe Art Gallery. I coupled it with a hat that was made from a border collage sheet. I used another border on the top from that same sheet. On the other side, I worked with the rain cloud stencils (although they got a little obscured by my writing, I actually think they provide a nice texture) and xoxo stencil--which while valentines day themed, works great for adding a little laying.

The writing of this one was strong in voice, with some great and hilarious descriptions that are definitely stand out. With a straightforward nature to it, and dragging only a few times, the writing has a great quality to it. Though the pacing of the overall plot fell through at times, Gibsen still provides a great climax and a good ending for the story. The history was woven into the present in a very good way, with some beautifully done triggering moments and switches. Despite the flaws this one had for me, it was still an enjoyable read.

These cases take an inordinate amount of time, which is having a knock-on effect.”

* developing a love of nature by helping your child to interact with nature and observe it first hand. This builds a variety of skills in a developmentally appropriate way: fine motor skills, large motor skills, attention, observation, visualizing (making a mental picture of what you have seen, which is needed for reading and spelling), visual and auditory memory, and probably others I'm not thinking of. You could buy a workbook, or a whole curriculum, to work on these skills, but God designed the natural world to develop them in just the right way at just the right times.

Although Landor’s study does not include Indian teens, the findings are relevant to the (urban) Indian context too. A former colleague who studied in one of the more posh schools in Mumbai with more than a dozen Bollywood kids as his classmates told me that they ‘went the whole hog’ by the time they graduated out of Class Ten. He laughed heartily as I looked at him with some amount of disbelief (and perhaps a little jealousy) and assured me he wasn’t lying.

The principle of literal interpretation gives us another rule, namely that the Bible in one sense is to be read like any other book. Though the Bible is not like any other book in that it carries with it the authority of divine inspiration, nevertheless, the inspiration of the Holy Spirit over a written text does not turn verbs into nouns or nouns into verbs.

Boehner and Romney have disguised Republican hostility to lower student loan rates just as they hid their opposition to a lower payroll tax behind professed concern over adding to the deficit. In both cases, statements by rank-and-file Congress members betrayed the truth of the situation. In November, Sen. John Kyl derided the cut as bad economics, saying, “the payroll tax holiday has not stimulated job creation; this week, the Republican Senate candidate for Missouri claimed that federal intervention in the loan market was giving America “stage three cancer of socialism.” (To which President Obama responded, “Just when you think you’ve heard it all in Washington, somebody comes up with a new way to go off the deep end.”) North Carolina Representative Victoria Foxx – who heads the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, of all things – earned a mention from President Obama himself for declaring that:
13. “The board of directors shall make the regulations of the Fund. Such regulations … shall be submitted to the Government for approval, and published in the Gazette officielle du Québec.

Unfortunately, this kind of teaching is all too common in the church and people are all too eager to receive it. It is true that God has blessed us and wants to bless us. But why does he want to bless us? The Genesis passage makes it clear: “so that you will be a blessing . . . and all the people of the earth shall be blessed through you” (Gen 12:2-3). What a different perspective the passage brings when we read the whole text. We are not blessed just so our name can be great and distinguished; we are blessed so that we can be a blessing to others. This is the testimony of the entire Bible. From Abram on, God unfolds his plan to bless the nations through his people whom he has blessed. The kind of preaching and teaching I saw on TV is exactly what made God so upset at Israel in the Old Testament. They kept thinking they were blessed only for their own fame and because of their special status as God’s chosen people. But God’s plan always has been and continues to be that he blesses his people so that they can be a blessing to others and bring glory to God’s name.

She might be a little old lady but she still washed the financing of international terrorism through her bank accounts that resulted in the worst act of political terrorism in Europe of the 21st Century, with 8 killed at the Government building and 69 kids murdered on a summer camp with many more injured and maimed.

Equally, as far as I can tell, the great majority of scientists whose efforts have helped to prove the reality of anthropogenic climate change have produced honest and competent research, and even the minority that hasn’t met this standard rarely managed to rise, or rather sink, to the levels of cherrypicking, obfuscation, and outright fiction routinely found in climate change denialist literature. That being said, there’s more going on in the world of climate change activism than the honest concern of citizens and the honest labor of researchers, and it’s past time to examine the reasons why the climate change movement got so large and accomplished so little. In the process, we’ll be touching on issues that bear directly on the broader theme I’ve been developing in the last few months, because the rise and fall of climate change activism over the last decade or so has an uncomfortably great deal to do with the mechanisms of empire and the balance of power in a strained and fraying global political system.

Forming regional patent offices is seen as a vital step in decentralizing and improving the patent examination process. Judge Michel has been a very vocal supporter of regional patent offices, and provided the following commentary during an interview (Aug. 2010) with Gene Quinn at the IP Watchdog: Almost every federal agency I know of has regional offices. The patent office is the odd man out. This isn’t something we don’t know how to do. We do this every year, every day, in practically every agency in the country. They all have regional offices other than the patent office. This is not a hard problem to engineer. This is a question of authority: you have to have the authority to do it. I’m told he doesn’t have the legal authority to open an office in Detroit or Los Angeles, or wherever it might be. Congress has to give it to him or he can’t do it. It’s that simple.
As usual I find it impossible to restrict myself to just one book because the history books you’ll find useful will differ depending on where your families come from. So here are some of my Irish, migration and Scottish references.
I was afraid he was having second thoughts, I was so close to realizing my fantasy with the man that made me feel more passion than I have ever felt in my life and I didnt want it to slip away… so I thought of something I shouldnt have ever thought about, yet it was something I knew he wouldnt resist… I should have been patient.. I should have valued myself more.. But the next day I texted him and offered him a commitment free deal..I told him I just wanted him physically.. It was a partial lie, I wanted more than that.. but I knew he wouldn’t say no..

We all know what it means when kids are playing doctor. Almost every kid has at some point in life experienced some form of exploration, either of themselves or of another child. And almost every single one of them has realised they are doing something taboo. As you all are aware, last month, April, was Child Sexual Awareness Month. And although the month is over, I had to post on this very important topic. The Bride brings up a few questions in her CSA post, including, how should parents react if they find their kids engaged in voluntary sexual acts? And is it still rape if it is between two minors, where one is the aggressor. The jury is out on the second one because there are so many grey areas here. Many sexually aggressive children have been abused themselves, and think this is perfectly normal behaviour. For the first, I turned to a couple of friends and gurus and Sandhya (I always count on her for a sensible, thought through response instead of my knee jerk ones) had this to say. I urge you to read both posts as well as comments for a very interesting and open minded discussion.

I saw this in the box and hated it. I didnt even want to try it on but I had the box already at my house, it would be a shame not to try it. Once I put it on I really liked it! It was delicate and really simple, but still really, really made an impression. I wanted to keep this, but the only reason I didnt was the price. I thought for over $30 I could better invest in a piece to wear, rather then add another necklace to my collection.
Reading the material from sites like this, this and this has made me quite dismayed at the state of the modern dating scene – it’s a tough world out there girls. But it has also given me a fantastic insight into the way modern men think and what they desire in a partner.

The Maya (through indigenous ancestral transmission and present-day descendants) believe that it is not a time to fear. We are at a crossroads. “Now it is time to choose a new path, decide on a new Self and community direction, to venture into the unknown, to find our true identity of being”. While devotees are already flocking to this ethos in droves, others will choose to stay on the same path, console themselves with the familiar, and invest a great deal of effort in maintaining the status quo.

I'm willing to work hard - but only for the things I believe in and I don't think we should work ourselves into the ground. It isn't healthy and it was recently published as one of the biggest regrets (working too hard and not enjoying life more) of the dying in the Guardian (or some newspaper)....

So my friends, what are we going to do? Jesus said in Luke 4:18-20: “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour.”

R.L. Bynum is a former newspaper editor who now works at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Durham, N.C. Before joining AICPA in 2010, Bynum was a copy editor and page designer at the Daily Press newspaper in Virginia, and he also worked in sports departments at several newspapers in North Carolina, including the Herald-Sun in Durham. In this interview, conducted by email, Bynum discusses his job, the transition from newspapers and his use of social media.
“He might have known that she would do this; she had never cared for him, she had made a fool of him from the beginning; she had no pity, she had no kindness, she had no charity. The only thing was to accept the inevitable. The pain he was suffering was horrible, he would sooner be dead than endure it; and the thought came to him that it would be better to finish with the whole thing: he might throw himself in the river or put his neck on a railway line; but he had no sooner set the thought into words than he rebelled against it. His reason told him that he would get over his unhappiness in time; if he tried with all his might he could forget her; and it would be grotesque to kill himself on account of a vulgar slut.”

The car heads inside a hotel car park and comes to a halt by the backstage entrance. The sudden revelation from K that this is a private wedding reception – ‘a small one, only 500 people or so’ – only adds to my excitement (and adds the mental note to cross ‘attend Indian wedding’ off my bucket list). Two bouncers open our doors and we’re humbly shepherded to a set of silver curtained dressing rooms, where K and I sit impassively on a white leather sofa and watch the fans rush eagerly in. I feel a little like a member of a cool security team, and get a rush of enjoyment when I realise that, for possibly the first time since arriving in India, I’m actually being stared at with jealousy! And even these stares are only fleeting, as they pass the random foreigner up in favour of their idol, Mr. B. His photo is taken with a steady succession of waiters, wedding guests, young men, old women, and even a couple of stage dancers, all who hug him with violent enthusiasm and try to stay in the little room as long as possible. The huge bouncers towering over the proceedings start to make me feel a tad suffocated, so while we wait for Mr. B’s performance to start, I head outside to have a gander at what an Indian wedding is really all about…

Second, Hobgood did include one paragraph that appeared to respond to testimony offered by Durham attorney Bill Cotter (who I know and like) on behalf of Cline. Cotter presented perhaps the most effective defense of Cline offered at the hearing. He didn’t try to defend the truth of Cline’s stories (as Cline’s attorneys did), or even the bizarre nature of her behavior. Instead, he suggested that the Cline-Hudson dispute should be characterized as a personal squabble, rather than something that rises to the level of professional misconduct.

The fourth film I seriously considered was Strangers On A Train. In this one, Guy meets a mysterious man on a train trip who offers a bizarre bargain: he’d kill Guy’s wife in exchange for Guy doing away with the man’s father, thereby solving both of their problems. Guy says no, but the man carries out his end anyway soon thereafter, by killing his wife. While the setup has some elements of horror, this movie ultimately becomes a thriller/blackmail film.
I like the idea of a female player, one that is not stalked by every man in the game, but a ruthless one, one with character, enough to remain a lady in the real world and a killer known for cruelty in the virtual. I also like that the author takes a (the) basic idea of feminism and conceals it between lines so it has a purpose besides entertainment.

Take your pick - unschooling, cloth diapers, home births, discipline, responsibility, whatever - if you have reviewed the common way of doing things and made a different choice, people will question it. And these questions can quickly put us on the defensive, feeling like we have to defend the very choices that we have put so much heart and thought into. There are a number of reasons why we so often feel the need to defend, but for sake of this post let's simply agree that, in the main, we defend because we feel we are being attacked.
All that said, you never really know, and so it’s best to tell the truth, as with all interview questions. The beauty of this question is that there is an answer which is probably truthful for 99% of people and this one puts the ball straight back into the interviewer’s court.

An extension of all this is the lack of visual atmosphere used to hide the limitations of sets, miniatures, and visual effects. Ridley Scott and his team achieved this visual disguise greatly with Alien using light, shadow, and smoke to disguise any budgetary limitations, or to blend miniatures, live action, and visual effects into a seamless whole. Clearly, something Scott continued on with in Blade Runner. The bonus of this in Alien is that it created a rock solid mysterious horror atmosphere that intensifies the overall unsettling nature of the movie. Here, you can see the lack of depth and scope in the shot where you know it’s a soundstage set when it’s supposed to be a convincing alien planet landscape. I’d expect that from an old episode of Star Trek that didn’t have the budget or technical knowledge to disguise these production shortcomings. I would not expect that from a film that had an even BIGGER budget than Ridley Scott’s film which achieved better results on a smaller budget. Again, James Cameron comes from a background of visual effects where he should know how to blur those lines, but what is displayed here would not at all reflect that experience.

After discovering John was with AIDS I was at first sad and then extremely angry with him. I also had mixed emotions of fright and nausea knowing that it was once again that close. I started imagining silly scenarios of what could have happened and worked it up that it was a narrow escape. It wasn't really, but maybe there was a part of me that did want to toast a goodbye with someone. Have a friend that close that I felt comfortable to do such a thing with. When my emotions settled down I was still angry, and then that passed and I remembered how John had cried when I left and how the memory of his home town had cut him in two. After that I started to recall snippits of things he had told me and how he so badly damned the needle but not heroin. It now made complete sense why. Heroin hadn't killed him; sharing needles had (or being duped into sharing a needle, who knows?) John felt hard done by. I then remembered him cursing his cousin with a vengeance, saying that he was the cunt who first pinned him up and got him on the needle. I also remember him saying his cousin had died from septicaemia. I suppose then that not only was it his cousin who had introduced him to the spike but had probably also infected him with HIV. I suppose, like Marge, John wanted someone else to experience the fear and hardship of what he was going through. That he didn't want to be all alone with what he had, but travel the road with another who was the same. But it's cruel. Humanity is cruel. And make no mistake about it what Marge did first and John did later, were human behaviours that are shocking and selfish but not incomprehensible or uncommon. They were just living up to the animal.
Columbia defense attorney Jack Swerling represented Dickey in his 2006 trial and says the state Supreme Court's recent move makes this an "important case," but does not set a legal precedent for the thousands of South Carolinians with concealed weapons permits to open fire if they feel threatened.It doesn't?

LSE’s Vice-Chancellor was forced to resign as the institution was seen to be little more than an academic prostitute, handing out degrees for cash.

What is really involved is the creation of a new Chair in Modern Israeli Propaganda masquerading as an academic programme.

So, Steve decides it’s a good idea to move the bookshelves, with the stuff still ON the shelves to see behind them. After getting conked in the head by a falling object, he determines, yep there’s a mouse back there. Sigh…It’s been so beautifully long since we’ve had a mouse I actually haven’t stocked up on traps in a while, but some old ones were hanging out on the bottom shelves. Loaded them up with peanut butter. Then Steve sets up his humane mouse trap, the tubes hanging over the edge of the shelf and over a tall plastic trash can/tub. No luck on Sunday.

You will not regret an exciting life that gives you new things to look forward to. As you start to see the results you never dreamed, it will become easier to make more changes. Remember that with change comes difficulty. Some of the changes will be excruciating, the sacrifices will be tough and some of the changes will be long.

For this shot to truly work it needed the background with all its faults to accentuate the foreground.

We have known some fervent Catholic families whose children know every sordid line from every popular song on the radio and sing them loudly without shame. And the parents don't even flinch. Blind spot. They worry about secular sex education in the schools and abortion and pray a daily Rosary... but there is no shame in allowing their children to absorb, memorize, sing, shout, and buy the spirit of the world. There is something particularly disturbing about listening to a child sing the music of Beyonce. If you are confused about this issue, then I suggest printing out the lyrics and having your child read them to you in a quiet room. That should clear things up quickly.
It makes me angry too. It makes me angry that in spite of the growing evidence, that schools continually chalk up bullying to “boys being boys” and “girls are just mean at that age”. Honestly, if they believe it’s just part of growing up to be harassed and tormented, I’d like to put them through it for a while and see what it’s like when “Men are being men, and women are just being mean.”
I keep thinking about how awesome next Christmas will be. Last Christmas was the best one in years- before that one, we'd given up all hope of a biological child. I remember that Christmas, we'd filled our "Wish" ornament with our wishes, and then we told them to each other. Our wishes were the same- that we'd get enough money for adoption, and for a house. While neither of those wishes came true, I wouldn't trade what we have now for the world. Things aren't perfect- far from it- but they're wonderful.

Really, that was just procrastination speaking. For goodness sakes, sometimes I spend that much on a meal! Day 1 starts now, I hope I'm not too out of shape!
Fast forward to yesterday. Ongoing issues with Chiari Malformation and herniated disks in my neck have offered up many chances to over come my fears and face them head on like a “big girl”.

But my ongoing annoying conditions have resulted in MANY needs for trigger point injections, cervical epidurals, and pin point electrocution.

Emerging on to the road, I arrive in the picturesque village of Holmbury St Mary. A passing lorry stops, and the driver leans out of his cab window. I assume he wants to ask for directions, but no, he just wants to comment on the beauty of the countryside compared to his native Norfolk, about which I concur, and the friendliness of the locals. I’m on the cusp of agreeing with this point too but the effect is somewhat spoilt by the driver of a sportscar impatiently beeping his horn. We say our hurried goodbyes; he heads south to his next delivery, I continue to the Kings Head for a quick pint – a great but quiet little country pub with an interesting display of mining explosives in a case on the wall.

We also learned about The MET's advisory, independent study, and internship programs. Many of the students also spoke of their senior exhibitions and the work they have been doing to prepare. Again, we want to learn more: What are the various components of senior exhibitions and how is the skeleton that creates The MET's unique learning environment used to scaffold these over student's time at the school? What type of ongoing formative assessment is used to measure student's progress?

It is impossible for my Mom and I to go to the big city without stopping somewhere for food and coffee. On the phone Wednesday night we longingly bandied about the idea of going to Cracker Barrel, but decided it would take too much time and settled on Panera Bread instead. We were trying so hard to be good girls and not spend the entire day in Tulsa. However, our plans quickly changed when I mentioned to Gideon that after our appointments we would be going to the place where he likes to eat muffins…

Ellis Hock loved teaching in Malawi for the Peace Corps, but that experience was cut short when he had to return to take over the family business. Thirty-five years later, the store and his marriage have failed, and he returns to Malawi for a nostalgia-induced vacation. He’s warned on arrival that people are hungry and only want money, but he heads into the bush with a bagful of it. Malabo, the remote riverbank village where he’s remembered as the mzungu (white man) who helped build the school and clinic, gives him a warm welcome, but Hock’s disillusion sets in fast. The school is a ruin; the visiting doctor is a quack; AIDS is rampant; requests for money are constant. The villagers keep him under surveillance at the direction of the headman Manyenga, who is all smiles and lies. He makes three escape attempts. All his escapes are foiled by the formidable Manyenga. This novel will have you on the edge of your seat wondering whether he will escape, and what will happen to the villagers.
He rightly praised the buildings, the Pennines on our doorstep, the great train services and the mild in the Rat and Ratchet. On a more obscure note he also liked the leftiness and the music scene (nothing out of the ordinary for me) and the property prices.

Rhys gives a very interesting version of how the story of Jane Eyre came to be through the character of the first wife who remains completely silent in Brontë’s novel. In that, her story is told by Rochester, but we can’t trust him as a narrator because he is trying to justify his actions to Jane in an attempt to explain the situation and keep her with him. However, I think that Wide Sargasso Sea is very much open for interpretation, both because of Rhys’ style of writing but also because we can’t trust the narrators. They are not telling the story to a listener, they are telling it to themselves, justifying their actions and their own views on things. Also, because Antoinette is said to be mad (like her mother) one can argue that she is even more unreliable as the reader doesn’t know if and when she’s lying/telling the truth. I would initially say that I didn’t like the book, but once I started interpreting it and thinking about it, it opened up to me and I found many interesting points that could be discussed and argued. It’s also an interesting prequel when it comes to Brontë’s novel because here we already see what sort of man Rochester is and what drives him to do the things he does.
I'm not continuing any search by reading the Bible. I find that being knowledgeable about a book that people want to tell me I should live my life by is the smart thing to do. I don't buy a word of it. It's not historically accurate, and it's filled with inconsistencies and atrocities that even a five year old can spot. Using the Bible to prove God's existence is like using a comic book to prove the existence of Superman.

What is it they say - April showers bring May flowers? In our case, April brought unseasonably warm weather and very little rain, which has been followed up by a super rainy May. Like three straight weeks of rain. Total blah weather. I'm a sunshine person - I don't really care what the temperature is outside as long as the sun is shining. It's a complete mood changer for me. So, by the end of the second week of rain, I was feeling as gloomy as the weather outside, and desperately craving comfort food.

You can see it better here at the zipper opening. It fits in the hips, but I need to take out 3″ a piece at the side seams, and 1/4″ at CB top of waistband (a curve basically) and another smidgen at CF, and grade these down to the hips smoothly. I also really need to lower the waistband first because it’s covering my bellybutton and I don’t like that. Realistically to make these a wearable muslin, I need to seam rip the waistband, shorten the waist seam and lower the front pleats and back darts. Then refit the waist seam since it will be in a new position. Then after that fitting I would have to resew the waistband and insert a zipper. I didn’t have enough fabric for the lining of the waistband, so I will have to cut re-sized waistband from another fabric and insert that as well before deciding on exact hem length. Am I going to do it? Honestly I don’t know if I like them that much! At this point, winter weather really set in last weekend and I realized how few winter items I actually own so I’m motivated in that direction. This muslin is going to take a nap. When I went to put it in the box, I came across a UFO in need of a zipper.

Other major figures were Bruno Augenstein who, according to Abella, made what is “arguably RAND’s greatest known — which is to say declassified — contribution to American national security: … the development of the ICBM as a weapon of war” (he invented the multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, or MIRV); Paul Baran who, in studying communications systems that could survive a nuclear attack, made major contributions to the development of the Internet and digital circuits; and Charles Hitch, head of RAND’s Economics Division from 1948 to 1961 and president of the University of California from 1967 to 1975.
Macpherson’s contribution to understanding problems of race in the United Kingdom is the discovery that the police are guilty of a whole catalogue of “race” crimes. To accusations of individual acts of racism, can be added those of “unwitting racism”, “unconscious racism”, “racist stereotyping”, “institutional racism” and “collective racism”. Variations on the basic theme of racism, these accusations are unremittingly asserted throughout the Macpherson Report. They contribute to the atmosphere of hysteria during and after the inquiry and will, one suspects, create considerable long term problems for the police and the rest of British society. Racism is defined as follows:
David Hare(1947) is one of Britain's most internationally performed playwrights. He was long associated with The National Theatre, which produced eleven of his plays successively between 1978 and 1997. A trilogy about the church, the law and the Labour Party - Racing Demon, Murmuring Judges and The Absence of War - was presented in repertory at the Olivier Theatre in 1993. Nine of his best-known plays, including Plenty, The Secret Rapture, Skylight, The Blue Room, Amy's View, The Judas Kiss and Via Dolorosa have been staged on Broadway.

“Where to now?” He asked, his voice barely audible over the engines deafening howl. She looked up at him, but didn’t respond. “Where to?” He said again, this time almost yelling. She closed her book and set it down across her lap. She grabbed a small black bag from her feet and unzipped it, and after a few moments of digging through its contents she withdrew a large folded piece of paper, and carefully peeled it open. It was a map they’d salvaged years ago from an infected scavenger. The plague hadn’t completely taken him yet, but just enough had gotten into him to make him completely insane. He hadn’t been carrying many rations, water, or even a gun or ammo, but the map had proven to be more valuable than any of those things. He went down with a fight too; he glanced at the scar on his right arm, “But you let your guard down,” His fathers voice popped into his head. “It’s your own fault.”

The other tutorial I used in making this card was a mini rose tutorial. I found the tutorial by Croping Queen (sorry she does not have a blog) for these roses, you can use any five petal flower. You can use a paper punch or your Cricut to create them. The best flower to use is the flower on Weddings Solution Cartridge because it is perfectly symmetrical but that is not totally neccessary. (Click HERE for tutorial). The leaves I just cut out by hand and added the details.
The ensemble cast, equal parts black and white, play multiple roles, most of them essaying roles of both races, which at times can be confusing. There is no offstage; when not playing specific characters, the actors move around the space as themselves, even before and after the show and during the two intermissions. Another Brechtian touch: the actors announce chapter titles to the audience before every scene. These Brechtian gestures indicate the direction in which perhaps the production wants to go, but it needs to go farther. It seems to me that an excellent way of dealing with the play’s many implausibilities and outmoded stereotypes would be to get right out in front of them with playing style – to deconstruct it, and comment on it with full-on alienation effect. I usually am not a fan of such shenanigans, but I think this particular story would suit it extremely well. It seems to me they are already part of the way there. Some of the actors, Marshall-Brown in particular as Topsy, seem to be palpably gagging on their “I’se jes’ wicked, massah!” dialect – why not allow them to ridicule it?

Well Glee returned last night after being off since mid February. Honestly...I wish it just stayed off the air. But hey, I chose to watch the new episode...but I think it may the last one I ever watch. When we last saw, the show ended with a cliffhanger, in a surprisingly good episode. Quinn was trying to get to Rachel and Finn's last minute wedding and was responding to Rachel's text (while driving) and was the episode ended drastically with Quinn being t-boned by a truck.

What weapon do you choose and what can it do? I think I'd have to go with a double headed spear. See, there would be enough staff between me and the blades to make me feel comfortable and the adjustable length of my incredibly awesome spear would allow for close or not-so-close range fighting. I must admit that my spear would also come with some very awesome armor, kind of like better-than-kevlar body suit of some sort.

Braun and Kemp winning those two awards is like two different actors winning the Academy Award and the Golden Globe. They have nothing whatsoever to do with each other.*

It's a clever visual reminder of both the delirious heights Eva and Juan Perón find themselves in by the halfway mark of this movie, as well as the unsteady base they've founded their power on. It's a castle built on quicksand, and - amid the eerie, minor-chord chanting of "Perón! Perón!"/"Eviiiita!" - the spotlight reels drunkenly and the framing is permanently off-kilter. This famous sequence is then gloriously bookended by "And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)", which is a montage of the Perón government hemhorraging funds - into hospitals, into infrastructure, into bread and circuses and their own pockets.

Slightly overcast and cool but not bad for our Barossa day, which I had been looking forward to for months. We started by going back to Anguston and visiting the cheese shop and then taking turns to go to the bookshop while the other did playground duty. It was a good shop run by a lady who had worked in lots of bookshops and was very interesting to chat to. On Roger’s recommendation from the list of child-friendly wineries we then went to Whistler which was indeed very friendly – toys inside and play equipment outside – and had the added bonus that the wines were terrific, much better than we had expected especially the riesling. A wanted to buy a dozen – unheard of! We bought a glass each to have with lunch while we decided what to buy. Next was the much anticipated visit to Maggie Beer’s where the cooking demonstration with verjuice did it’s job in convincing us to buy some. It certainly adds flavour to roast veges. We then went to have a look at Tanunda which was not that spectacular. The cafe we tried was in keeping with the town which, given the number of fantastic food places around was a bit disappointing. We went back to the caravan park and all played tennis for a couple of hours as the excellent courts were free and rackets only $5 to hire. Our last holiday dinner was a BBQ at the table outside with a nice glass of wine.

It is a story about love and forgiveness during the Napoleonic wars. To me, as I am a romance-junkie, my attention was mainly focused on Natasha Rostova and Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. The naïve, young, hopelessly romantic Natasha first sees Bolkonsky at a party, which marks the turning point in her life. Not only does she find herself infatuated with the cynical, and utterly gorgeous Bolkonsky, who is disillusioned with marriage life (yes, he IS married!), but she, along with all the other women, discover that they will have to let go of their men, for they are being called to join the army to fight against Napoleon. The Prince goes off to war, and it is at Austerlitz that he realizes that man cannot live for glory alone, so he is determined to return home and refocus his life on his family—to love the wife he had been neglecting for so long. Tragedy strikes, however, and throws the spritely Natasha back into his life. Lost in the pits of misery, Bolkonsky cannot help but admire Natasha’s enthusiasm for life. One of my favorite moments in the series was Bolkonsky watching Natasha dancing outside, and saying to his friend: “How is it possible for someone to be so happy?” He eventually falls in love with her. But then war tears them apart again. Natasha is left to wait for the Prince for a year, in which her devotion is tested—and this youthful heart of her fails to stay true. When the Prince returns back from the war, expecting to reunite with Natasha again, he learns that she has betrayed him, and the love that once burned in him turns into hatred. His pride won’t allow him to forgive her. Yet as the story progresses, his resentment begins to chip away with the clashing of events around him, and one final, tragic yet moving moment renews the love that Bolkonsky and Natasha had once had for each other.
The humble banana, I discovered, is a wonder fruit. Bananas consist mainly of sugar and fiber, which make them an ideal source of energy. No wonder it's a staple in the diets of athletes. And as a trying-hard jogger, I eat a banana before a run, or when I skipped a meal. My mother has high blood pressure and high cholesterol level, and aside from prescribed meds, the cardiologist recommends a diet with Saba banana daily for its rich potassium content that can reduce the incidence of a stroke.

We supposedly live in a free society--we are free to cross borders without reporting that travel to our state government. We also have the right to purchase anything we choose in the states we travel to and not report back to our home state government. It is time the federal government cuts some of these states off as this blogger is starting to feel like I am not living in a free country at all. If my state knows, where I travel, what I purchase, and can discriminate against me at their will, that is not freedom. That my friends is not Socialism---it is Communism.
I expect that someone reading this may question the validity of my note but fareals, I don’t feel this is a normal aspect of a normal person’s everyday normal thought process.

In the space of ten minutes, I planned a vacation, rehashed this weekend’s camping trip, thought organized an annotated bibliography and all of this was while I was creating a demographics excel file using formulas I still don’t understand while listening to muzak during an intensely frustrating hold session with the state. (Oh and the vacation is canceled due to various contingencies which I will have to re-think at a later date.)

Family, friends, making art, gardening, yoga, swimming, walking, biking, quilting, cooking, writing book reviews for Library Journal and facilitating a group called Creative Intentions on the Here Women Talk website, book group, fiber arts group, Sunday UU women's native American spirituality circle: these things form the foundation of my days. Sounds idyllic, but life is never 100% rainbows. My mother, who is 93, and still living semi-independently, directly and indirectly demands a lot of my attention. Just last week I returned from Long Island after visiting her and hiring a 24 hour live-in aide now needed to keep Mom safe at home.
In “LGF’s Lunacy Comes Full Circle,” at Man Sized Target, Chris Roach has done a better job of succinctly describing LGF than I ever could (see below).
Hardly ever do these movies focus on the meat of the relationship that a man and woman are already in. It’s always about the initial feel good stages and the PURSUIT. This is what irks me about romantic movies. I like to see a good love story like the next woman – but I want it to be deep and realistic. Most romantic movies aren’t. It’s not deep enough b/c it’s always mostly about the guy pursuing the woman and doing all of these asinine crazy things to win her over. Then by the end of the movie he wins her affections and we are left to *believe* they lived happily ever after. In my most Sha nay Nay ghetto tone with a finger snap – AH UH! That doesn’t cut it in Neecy’s book.
So whatever happened to that girl that said she was going to take care of this place anyway? She’s a real slacker.

The fact that Molson Coors are trying. This was presented on Monday as part of a broader programme of ideas and initiatives to really promote beer across the board. Molson Coors are a big multinational brewer who talk about beer in marketing speak (the subject of another piece). But I get the impression they do actually care about beer. They show signs of understanding it, and respecting it. Growing Sharps and Worthington are as much part of their plan as boosting Carling - which, by the way, also got a shout on Monday night. A new 4.8% 'premium' version, Carling Chrome, is bland, pretty tasteless, but not watery and without the nasty aftertaste some of these beers have. On the beer for women thing, they've spoken to tens of thousands of women and really got to the heart of what's keeping them from beer.

at least for this type of duvet. I used knit because I found an amazing deal on a knit fabric that was exactly the color I was looking for ($.63/yd). Maybe if you are a more advanced sewer you could pull this off, but this was the 2nd project I started & I found the knit to be so difficult to work with. Maybe as I gain more experience, knit won't be such a challenge. But should you decide to make a duvet as your 2nd sewing project stick with some more forgiving fabric.

First off, I love that you guys saw the ability of the very under-appreciated middle reliever Steve Reed. In comparison to role players from all positions, I would argue that Steve Reed is the most valuable Rockie ever. He is obviously not as valuable as stars such as Helton, Walker, or Tulowitzki, but Reed went out to the mound every other game for seven years and got tough outs more often than not. So let's appreciate Steve Reed as a Rock Star right handed reliever.

It is “beyond us,” ladies—beyond you, and beyond me—to live a you-first life in a me-first world. But if ever that me-first world needed to see a you-first life in action, it’s now! Therefore it’s up to us to commit to being the ones who will live so closely to the Father’s heart and so dependent upon His Holy Spirit and His Word that God can use us to show the world a better way.

It was budget friendly too. Initially I went down the road of an old hutch we could convert, scouring Craigslist and the like for the perfect little china cabinet we could strip of is 1980's lacquer and paint. But alas, it was not to be. I could not find anything within our budget range. So was born the idea to customize an Ikea Liatorp and give it the patina of a painted and layered piece of vintage furniture.
Still, this isn’t a cynical film. Chaplin may not guarantee happiness for the Tramp and Gamin, but they are individuals, and willingly so, and that gives us hope. They must change, so they do. If everyone around them did the same, the end-of-the-line might not be such a bad thing.

It is long lasting and not drying... Can you tell... I am mad about this red...

I started piano lessons at the age of 6 with Mrs Hare. She was a nice woman, probably; but in my twisted childhood memory I have cast her as a warty thug who bullied me across the hot coals of do-re-mi. I stuck it for about three months, grinding through Elementary Piano Book One until we reached Swanee River by Stephen Foster. (Foster, as it happens, was also a trespasser. Born in Pennsylvania, he never saw the actual Suwannee River – nor did he set foot in Florida, which adopted the song as its state anthem in 1935. I’m just saying.)
The police are dealing with the horrible Bristol murder, and we ought to let them get on with their job. A man is in custody, and investigations continue. If there is enough evidence the CPS will authorise charge, and the justice system will take its course….

I did not get around to: Black Bean and Corn Chicken Taco Bake, Corn and Potato Chowder, or Pioneer Woman's Ribeyes. Instead, we had homemade macaroni and cheese one night, and Rachael Ray's Black Bean Stoup another night. This is my favorite black bean soup recipe, although I do leave out the tomatoes. (As you can tell, my people have a thing about chunky tomatoes.) Oh, and Randy and I also went on a DATE and ate at an actual RESTAURANT sans children. We have a fabulous Thai restaurant here, and I had gift cards. Happy day!

Prepare a work surface with a generous dusting of flour. Flour your rolling pin. Cut dough ball in half. Cover other half with plastic to prevent drying. Shape a new ball on the work surface. Roll out dough slowly and carefully to a thickness of approximately 1/4 inch. Using a 2-inch cookie cutter (of any shape of your choosing), cut dough and transfer each cookie to either a non-stick cookie sheet or a regular sheet that is prepared with a light greasing of non-stick spray or a ply of baking parchment paper. (Any dough scraps can easily be gathered up to roll out and cut again.) Space cookies 2-inches apart. Place on center rack of oven and bake for 20* minutes or until cookies are lightly brown. Remove to cooling rack. Serve as they are or dust with powdered sugar and/or additional cinnamon; or decorate with a glaze or royal icing.

The main takeaway from all this analysis is this. The DOW is now the important index to watch. If it turns lower from around current levels, and makes news lows, Major wave 4 should be completing. If it confirms a new uptrend, the uptrend should be limited to DOW 13,520. This will keep the Int. wave B correction counter rally in place, and Int. wave C would follow to complete Major wave 4. Should the DOW exceed 13,520 then the Major wave 4 completed alternate count would gain in probablity. This market has basically reached another inflection point.

You're as tight as I knew you would be, and I ever-so-slowly pump it in and out, letting you relax and get used to the feeling. I pull my finger out and touch my cockhead to your opening, getting in position.

Granddaddy and his second wife, Wilma, visited Margaret and me as often as they could, and they always took us shopping and out to nice restaurants. We could have anything we wanted when they came. I remember a trip with them to Howard Johnson’s when they had many flavors of ice cream, and after a fine dinner we had so much fun picking out two or three flavors to eat on sugar cones. They bought each of us a box of candy before returning us to the orphanage.

A lot of people find it hard to be comfortable on their own, which is okay too, but at the same time, I feel that its good for people to learn to be comfortable in their own company. To imagine things, to read or watch a film, to give themselves some time and space to sit and reflect. Our society is all about fast things, technology, everyone seems to be on the go and it feels sometimes as though people have forgotten the value of slowing down, taking time to think and be more creative. I like the hours when everyone is asleep, and I can read or write, or write blog posts like this one. When I can reflect and the illusion of a sleeping world is complete. Even though I know that other people are awake in other parts of the world, for me – this feels like quiet reflection, this is what introversion gives me. I don’t always feel as though I have to fill every part of my day with something busy and noisy. I like silence, even though I love to communicate too.
I haven't done a Weekend Re-Hash in awhile, but I had so much fun the last few days I thought I'd share.

The son of a French soldier, Alphonse emigrated to London to work in a firm of scientific instrument workers. Soon he was making his own goods for electrical firms and quickly established a reputation for excellent workmanship. He came to Tyneside in 1901 and founded A. Reyrolle & Co. By the time of his death 18 years later the firm had over 700 workers due to the early monopoly of the production of switchgear for use in coal mines, power stations and warships. Married with one son he lived for several years at Beech Grove Road near Elswick Park.

When the Christians came into power they introduced their concepts of beauty. They added statuary to their gardens, depicted human heroes, powerful political figures and religious deities. Their gardens introduced fountains of shooting water and colorful flowers. When they played “She loves me, she loves me not,” “She loves me” won, and flowers became integral parts of the garden. Aunt Bessie out in Boise, Idaho owes her State Fair prize rose awards to this change of values in the garden.

And I’m never sure how to respond to this. I could disagree, and argue that it’s never hopeless, that there’s always reason to hope for a better tomorrow. But what do I know? I’m 19 years old. I’m part of the wealthiest one percent of people in the world and I’m also part of the one percent of people who will go to university. So what do I know of living in fear of the government, of not having access to water, of watching a loved one die before your eyes. I know nothing. So who am I to correct someone who has experienced those things?

Then we moved along the coast a few miles and visited the Plimouth plantation (that's how they spell it for this section of the museum - it's all connected). This (mainly outdoor) museum was absolutely fascinating. The first section is about the local Native American Wampanoag people - both their history and their present - and you can see their traditional houses, how they make their mishoons (a kind of canoe) and you can speak to the people there (which we did and it was really interesting). The next area is back into reliving history and there were lots of people dressed as pilgrims from 1620 - totally role-playing (and very well too - accents, details, all playing individual characters, not all agreeing with each other). We learned loads about American (and European) history and met some friendly people. The whole day was great - highly recommended. Photos below.

We had the same conversations over and over again until you helped me to change my mind. It’s because you’re exhausting that you could do that. I’m so glad you were. Think of all the people I could have influenced to hate God if I’d kept spewing my bitter reasoning.”

True. But what we've seen so far in terms of editorial slant -- and that probably won't change a lot when the new Adweek launches on Monday, even if the packaging does -- is something that stands a good chance of abandoning the core audience in an attempt to attract new readers, who could care less about CPMs, rate cards and who just won the Novartis media account. (Yes, I've made this point before.) But there are loads of publications and blogs that serve those people -- ranging from Gawker to The New York Observer's Media Mob to Romenesko. Even with the plethora of ad, media and marketing blogs, the mechanics of the media and advertising business isn't covered quite as closely.

Finding your dream home is difficult enough, but what if you found it and then discovered it was haunted? Medium Camilla Armstrong is led to the beautiful Rosehill country estate after communication with her deceased grandmother. On first inspection she senses tranquillity within the house; the gentle atmosphere of a Georgian manor that is crying out for new life. But when she moves in, Camilla discovers the house contains a dark secret, one which is to change her life forever. When The Reverend Marcus Calloway introduces himself to her, a friendship develops and Camilla realises she could at last have found her true love. But all is not what it seems when further spirit contact confirms that Marcus harbours a guilty secret. Spirit communication, manifestations and an eerie atmosphere all add to Camilla's new surroundings as she tries hard to decipher mixed messages and a life she never knew existed.

That's even more of a waste of time in my opinion.

Because this letter was written to Philemon, we perceive that he was this man’s slave. In reading Colossians 4:9, this slave is mentioned and identified. “With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.” This passage also informs us that Paul was sending this letter to the church in Colosse with one of his fellow-labourers, Tychicus and this same Onesimus.

When I left my last job, roughly six years ago this month, I had a decent sized retirement investment account stashed away. Ofcourse the smart thing to do was to move it and stash it somewhere else and that’s exactly what I did. I requested a distribution and they sent me a check. The check went into another account. Simple. Except I got an ominous looking letter in the mail today from them, with bold lettering saying “THE STATE OF GEORGIA REQUIRES US TO NOTIFY YOU THAT YOUR UNCLAIMED/ABANDONED PROPERTY MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO THE STATE IF YOU DO NOT CONTACT US.”

So I don't think I'd change anything. I'm just really grateful to be where I am.
And I really felt good about it. I got a great deal, and he seemed content with the cash (as much as I pleaded for him not to take my money, and said I felt bad for doing it, he assured me that he was happy with the transaction). Clearly, nobody was being screwed over by this deal.

A theme in Turton's paper was that it would take an enormous amount of technical and scientific ingenuity to solve South Africa's water quality problems, but that there was a shortage of scientific, engineering and technical capacity in the country.
Not only are you serving God and laying up treasure in heaven, but in most cases the accommodations are cheaper than a tradition hotel. We’ve stayed on air mattresses in church gyms, on cots in empty Sunday school rooms—not a five-star hotel, but still creating priceless memories. And don’t forget the tax benefits.
Dad stood back and watched. When we were done he sized it up from all angles, hummed and tutted, and shook his head. He stomped off to his workshop again, and returned with his flashlight. Down on his belly, he wiggled under the tree and fit the flashlight so that it pointed up through the branches. Then, he switched it on.

I use 1 Tablespoon (yep - ONE tablespoon) per load for my front loader. I would estimate a regular washer would probably use 1/4-1/3 cup, but I really have no idea, so you'd have to experiment there.

We went to Baptism Class last week and took Kiley with us. She was as good as gold! We are hoping to get that date on the calendar here soon too. We just have to wait confirmation from our church for the day we requested. All in good time, I know! We viewed a video of the baptismal process with infants and I already know I will not make it through without crying tears of great joy! Heck, I even teared up watching the silly video! Mushpot, mushpot, mushpot! I know!!
What I remember most fondly about that first day at the festival is:
It’s no wonder that the extreme conservative right-wing of America’s politicians are waging a war against women’s rights. Most of these poor confused souls have an appendage in serious need of talk-therapy and high doses of lithium. Please follow my musing mind…

The outside of the place doesn’t do the theater justice since it simply looks like an old building, especially when it’s located next to the Medieval Times Castle, which is an adventure with a similar concept but different theme. However, the entrance is festively decorated as a type of saloon where adults can enjoy drinks from the bar while pirate-looking ladies and lads walk around with appetizers such as various cheeses, fruits, and meats.
No sir. The European far right could never rise again. That's crazy talk.

I was just beginning to think in terms of my "Blowing Things Out of Your Hands" theme so I had her blow them out of her hands really hard, too. The lighting was weird but I got what I wanted--a shower of these little plastic thingies flying.
This book is a complete shock: it is creatively conceived, well-written, fully-documented, entertaining, relevant to both our bedroom behavior and public policy issues—-and it’s popular. People are buying it! People are even reading it!

Here's the final pack I'll be posting from the lot of 17 1978-79 Topps hockey packs I snagged at the hobby shop well over a year ago now. This one was by far the best of the lot. 12 cards and a sticker, here we go...
For business owners in the more popular competitive fields it is virtually impossible to beg, steal, or borrow a top page one ranking on Google. The smart larger firms started optimizing for SEO ages ago. They hire rooms full of people in Bangalore or Shanghai to sit around for $2.20 a day and stuff keywords into content, Meta tags, Meta descriptions, photo titles,pop-ups, dropdowns, and URL’s.

The government is still running banks for shareholder value, the model responsible for the crisis. Rather than the government nationalising some banks, it has privatised the Treasury into being a new kind of investment fund.
After almost a year, I have finally finished my frame project of my husband with our then, new baby granddaughter. I love the photo....I can just imagine her little mind saying....'now who are you again in relation to me??' Yesterday we had a get together of friends at Ann Craig, our friend and Stampin' Up consultants home....very handy if you need to purchase anything to add to your project or start your project because she has everything!! We were to start at 10am and finish by 4pm....of course, I was running a bit late, but I was not alone!! I was on a mission to finish a project I had started quite some time ago, but it had ground to a standstill as I was unsure of how to put it together. So with that and a back up of some other old family photos I began.
Look what I found today when I cleaned out my closet.
Not entirely mistaken. There is surely some truth in the quotation, in some parts or aspects of American life. But African-Americans in a nearly all-black neighborhood are certainly in a position to oppress non-black residents of that neighborhood; hence the tensions in e.g., south central L.A. vis-a-vis Asian shopowners and Hispanics. Social workers need to be culturally aware of such things — not just waltz in with ideas that are a half-century old, and that no longer apply in many geographical areas where social workers are especially likely to serve.

I think by the time I had seen Christine eat her souffle, I felt left out so I ordered “guess the name Macaroons” where our server egged us on to guess the exact flavors (which was a surprisingly difficult task, actually). Finish it off with a coffee, and there you have the perfect Sunday morning.

SOMEONE complained about not getting a post yesterday, so I was going to remedy that with a rambling post of fluff today. Alas, work has reared its ugly head and commenced to lay siege to my free time, so I give you a screenshot instead. Deal with it.

The flip side of this, of course, is that you don't mess with Marla's birthday. You'd think she would have forgotten by now that I got my first driver's license on her birthday, but trust me, she hasn't. Then when bought my first car on her birthday, she started to get annoyed. Follow that up with getting my Master's degree and she's now suspicious of all my activities on her birthday. I don't try to steal her spotlight, but things just seem to work out for me on her special day. I know she's just a little worried today that I will have the baby a few weeks early. (To tell the truth, I am, too.)

This is one of those unbelievably rare moments — when HBO actually throws its considerable resources toward a brilliant and celebrated show with nothing but a whole lot of women in the cast. Girls isn’t just the first show about women on the network since the finale of Sex and the City in 2004; it’s also written and directed by a woman, the preternaturally gifted Lena Dunham. As a result, it saves the network from being one of the most truly retrograde in existence with regard to gender balance.
My granddaughter, Haley, and I spend a lot of time together. We both have gigantic imaginations and love to share made-up stories with each other. Our favorite subject is heaven, and so we use our imaginations and what the Bible says about heaven.
The case is scratched to heck but the card is good.
And now, just when we thought his complete disregard for democracy which many of us have suspected for a while was thought to be at its height, he is acting like a madman, defending actions by someone in power which can't be defended, refusing to have them investigated thoroughly.
I ate before I walked over here (I’m always amazed at the people who drive in the French Quarter area). Acme Oyster Bar - oysters on the half shell, my usual. I went early so I wouldn’t have to wait in line and so I could make it over here to Preservation Hall before they open the doors.

Born Burnu Acquanetta in Cheyenne, Wyoming, to an Arapaho mother and a French-English-Cherokee father, she was given up for adoption and raised as Mildred Davenport by adoptive parents in Norristown, Pa. Accounts of her "real" story vary widely because early agents thought it best to conceal her Black heritage. Which really wasn't too unheard of back then because there was favoritism towards light skinned women within the race. And as for outside of the Black race, the lighter you were back then, the better you could pass for White. Therefore, you have two conflicting stories one being she was born on a reservation... The other story is she was born to light skinned working class Black parents.
During yesterday's Real Estate Committee meeting, the RIOC Board Directors reported reservations that safety concerns from objects falling from the Queensboro Bridge on to the proposed boating facility and the strong East River currents have not yet been adequately addressed. Another concern was that other NYC kayaking and rowing groups should be given the opportunity to express interest in a Roosevelt Island facility.

I needed to take my four year old son to the bathroom yesterday during the long trip home. When carrying him through a convenience store to get to the bathroom, I was pointing to the food and whispering in his ear, "Poison, that is poison."
Alone, this is much more difficult. It is less likely that you will be able to start a conversation about ethnobotany or Malthusian economics until the requisite formalities are complete. That is not the whole of the problem though. As a traveler and frequenter of conversations with strangers, you have to go through this process over, and over, and over. And over. You get over it pretty damn quick. Then, even if you can manage to avoid misanthropy, your boredom and frustration with lackluster wordsmithing will shine through, and it becomes impossible to either make a good first impression, or to provide an accurate representation of who you are and what you care about, or to tease it out of others.
We’re drowning in a universal waterfall.
The next day we were up early, I was dressed in enough thick clothing that it was impossible to press my arms flat against my sides. This was not a problem as it meant I was warm and I had absolutely no intention of keeping my arms still anyway! We rode out to the maple forest on a sleigh which was drawn by a single huge Clydesdale horse. His hooves were the size of my head but he had the gentlest soul and was always willing to have me placed upon his back. He would walk gently around while I chirped in my shrill bird song pitched voice, exhilarated and running a constant commentary on all the things I could see from the great height I had attained.

McCain and the GOP are bereft of ideas. Having sold their souls to the Christian Conservatives (pun noted) and their only true guiding economic philosophy being “the market will take care of everything, so take the shackles off and watch it go” we have arrived here. And make no mistake: it is the GOP who is to blame. They controlled the House from 1994 until 2006; they controlled the Senate from 1998 to 2006, and the Presidency from 2000 until the present. Read that again if you have not digested it.

Zany isn't enough to keep you going three seasons. Part of what helps is Michael, who looks like (and thinks he is) the Marilyn in the Munsters Family. The normal one. Except what is awesome is Michael is just as looney tunes as the rest of the family. All of them have a distorted view of themselves and their world and their place in it. While Michael sees how wrong his mother's relationship with her youngest son is, Michael and George Michael's relationship isn't much better.

When we decided to move The Geej to public school for the first grade, the spectre of what to do with the vexing hours between roughly 2:30 and 5:30 loomed large. The school offers several after-school program options--one, on campus put on by the YMCA, and the others, off campus at other facilities. So of course, I have drug my heels in touring these facilities and making a decision until today.
I just got the chance to sit down and watch Barack Obama's inaugural address online, and I have to say that it brought tears to my eyes. Here I am, sitting in an internet cafe in Thailand wearing my Texans for Obama t-shirt and crying. A girl from Holland sitting next to me asked if I was ok, and the only response I could muster was to point at the screen. She smiled, gave me a hug, and said, "I think the whole world is proud of him today."
The driver nods and drives in the opposite direction. I figure he knows where he's going...until he stops at an intersection near my house and asks Right or Left? Stunned, I shake my head neither. He lets me out and gives me a W300 discount. Thanks, Driver.
“Todas las hojas en las camas,” I say to the guys, hoping they’ll forgive my terrible Spanish. Next year, before the leaves fall, I’ll send the boss a packet of articles about the subject and direct him to Home Depot and Sears ads for mulching mowers.
Tonight I had dinner with my little friend Chipmonkey. In my watercolor state, I look at her and all I keep seeing are her beautiful eyelashes. I don't know if I have come right out and told her she has pretty eyelashes, but she does. And if she's reading this, then she'll know.
This doesn’t mean I’m ready to call it quits, I’m just hard-pressed to imagine doing anything Hero 2 worthy. But what if I was 90 watching myself write this blog while listening to music, would I impress my older self with an activity I won’t be able to do then?
Slow is when I didn't get my big behind off the couch to get out and exercise. Slow is being injured and not being able to get out there and do it.
though i know it was not the kind of justice that dr. king spoke of, i had the opportunity to see some small type of karma repaid yesterday....and i have to admit it felt the slightest bit good. (so good that i'm fighting not to gloat so please forgive me here) it was just the proof of the adage "be careful how you treat the people you meet going up the ladder, they are the same people you will meet going down the ladder."

5. Go see some films while you're in town. If you come to Austin without a visit to an Alamo Drafthouse, you are missing a huge part of the experience. There is a reason that Entertainment Weekly named it the best movie theater in the country; trust me on this. And, when better than South By, when all the Drafthouses are full of some super-good docs that you may never get to see again?
Things changed, as we all know, and while Yuengling is still only in fourteen states, they announced today that thanks largely to the huge surge in sales from their Ohio launch last year, they are now the largest American-owned brewery. Think on that, ye mighty, and despair.
This clique is now isolated and hiding in the Imperial Palace behind 6,000 uniformed guards. However, since White Dragon Society members are part of the inner staff of the Imperial palace, they must surrender and allow Eijiro Katsu, the senior Ministry of Finance Bureaucrat and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa to open up the BOJ Black Screens and release the funding for the new financial system. Japan’s Ministry of Finance will then receive an initial payment of $10 trillion to be used fort post-earthquake rebuilding and to set up a new International Economic Planning Agency.

Last week, I took my son to a long-awaited night at a museum event. We spent the night, along with a slew of other kids that he didn’t know, except one. He was oh.so.excited. They had a presentation and he asked a lot of questions. He likes to clarify rules — maybe it’s irritating to some, but I don’t know, I’d rather he get the clarification he needs rather than just wonder and break a rule, which would have far worse consequences. He also likes to punctuate rules with “Wow. Okay.” or “What?” It’s not disruptive, it’s not over the top, it’s just a far cry from the kid who wouldn’t go to a public event or speak up if he did. I’ll take this BB over the BB of several years ago. If I’d been next to him, I’d have nudged him, but to make a scene by ‘excuse me..excuse me..excuse me..’ to walk up the only aisle, in the middle of the seats, to get to him and tell him to hush? Humiliation and more disruption. I was in the back, where parents usually sit, again, trying to do the right thing.

I continued on with my walk until I came to the Abby. When I looked up, there was an amazing oak tree right in front of me. The trunk of the tree must have been at least four feet wide. The lower branches were as thick as most tree trunks. They were so heavy they rested on the ground. You had to duck under the lower branches to get to the trunk. Once inside, the canopy of the branches created the most serene feeling. The entire tree engulfed you. He motioned for me to go to the tree. He said, “The tree can help you with your speech.”

Joslyn was a good hand; Helicopter Dan was right about that. Hard working, knowledgeable and gifted, he was exactly what the doctor ordered despite my despair over parting with our hard earned cash money. Joslyn was a breath of fresh air that was most welcomed by two weary people who were both filled with worry and exhaustion. In no time at all Kurt and Joslyn had all of the fencing up around the land except in the front area where we needed to keep it open for John’s big trucks and the trucks that would eventually arrive with our modular home ready for delivery. But the storage locker pasture was completely closed in now and had its lovely pasture gates hung expertly so that they closed perfectly and stayed latched, didn’t swing back open like I had seen on other property. It was comforting to witness the progress now, with sore eyes that needed cleansing by good news and the pretty picture of our land taking shape in the form of a home. Well, the promise of a home, eventually.
After Sherlock Holmes' death, Dr. Watson recounts the most horrific tale of their investigating career, one which he wants sealed for 100 years after his death. Edmund Carstairs, an art dealer, seeks the help of the two because he believes he is being stalked by Keelan O'Donaghue, the head of the Flat Cap Gang, which was behind a train robbery that resulted in the loss of several very valuable paintings Carstairs' gallery was selling in the US. Back in London, Carstairs fears for his safety, and that of his new wife. When Sherlock investigate, he finds that seemingly unremarkable people in Carstairs' case seem also to be involved with an organization called the House of Silk, which is tied to horrific murders. Sherlock's brother Mycroft tells him to let it be, since his sources indicate that high level officials don't want this matter looked into, but of course this is not the case. Sherlock is framed in the death of a young girl and is in the most precarious position of his career. Plenty of twists and turns lead up to the conclusion of the mystery.

Not a trace of the tower or mound of the motte and bailey castle remains now. Henry II replaced it with a rectangular stone keep, which was built between 1172 and 1177 at a cost of £1,444. A stone bailey, in the form of a triangle, replaced the previous wooden one. The master mason or architect, Maurice, also built Dover Castle. The great outer gateway to the castle, called ‘the Black Gate’, was built later, between 1247 and 1250, in the reign of Henry III. There were at that time no town walls and when attacked by the Scots, the townspeople had to crowd into the bailey for safety. It is probable that the new castle acted as a magnet for local merchants because of the safety it provided in dangerous times.
This is a great example of my love of contrast that I was talking about in my post about Coke Addiction 3. Note that all the delicate highlights were not created by using opaque paints or inks; I'm just painting around the highlights with dark colours and allowing the paper (or very light watercolours) exposed. I don't feel those other methods are bad or "cheating," I just like to challenge myself without them first, then, if I mess up, I'll use white ink or acrylic.

Wow, I am down to my last 5 cards in the Scraps Card series. Since a few of my friends are having boys or just had a boy, I needed to restock my stash.

On the radio, people almost always choose, or perhaps feel obliged to select, at least one piece of classical music; apparently, the most popular is Beethoven's ninth symphony. I'm no different, except for me, there's not the tiniest sense of obligation, and it's not Beethoven I'd pick; the track I'd go for is Sibelius' Finlandia. I'd choose it because every time I listened to it I know I'd be taken away from the isolation and desperation of my desert island, and back to the astonishment and wonder of the first time I heard it performed.
When I took these pictures, it made me think of all the time and effort it took to build this structure. In the same way I’m going to continue and pursue my career in photography. It’s going to take a vision, plan, and execution, much like this structure.

Well, this recipe (along with greens, cabbage and other beans) has to be one of the more simpler dishes to make. Alongside a good hunk… of cornbread that is, it can be considered a meal all its own and it’s as easy as 1-2-3. It simply uses frozen peas and smoked turkey parts. You can use just about any type of peas or beans… butter beans, lima beans, field peas, black eyed peas, etc. As far as the meat, we love smoked turkey wings or drums but some may use smoked neck bones, or smoked hocks. It really “boils” down to personal preference and my preference is smoked turkey drums. You only need one drum which provides a lot of flavor and a lot of meat. It really is delicious. I just finished my second bowl with my 11-year old who chanted on about how nice it is for a mother and son to be in the kitchen…cooking together!!! That’s today, just yesterday I was the mean mom who won’t allow him to have any fun because I’m against video games…lol (talk about mood swings).

This article is a case study of a repatriation dispute under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The dispute arose when different tribal groups claimed a set of three leather shields held by the National Park Service. The article examines in depth the claims of the three groups, focusing on the disconnect between legal and anthropological determinations of cultural affiliation and using storytelling as a lens to evaluate the claims.
Now any self respecting physicist, but more especially a graduate of Patrick Moore's 'Observer's Book of Astronomy', c.1969 (alpha-this, gamma-that is conspicuous in the winter sky, etc), should be able to read alphabetical greek... "Argonautica... is that the Tim Severin expedition?" - the one I'd read about in my father's Telegraph supplement? I'd just sailed back from Trebizond on the regular ferry after back-packing around Turkey. They'd just rowed a thousand miles in the opposite direction from Volos (Iolcos) to Georgia; their tremendous callouses bore witness to that fact, and to pretty useless winds. But they'd reached Jason's destination and found that people still "pan for gold" using sheep fleeces there, in the mountain streams.
Just because I live in Japan, does not mean I am anyone's personal shopping site. That's why amazon exists. And contrary to popular belief, Japan is not jam-packed with anime, manga, and other related fanstuff. Sure it exists, but it's not fucking everywhere and it's definitely not in the places I go to. Tokyo's fucking huge, with tons of districts and stores, and tons of places that I never go to because I have no interest in these things. So how the hell can you think this is even an acceptable request?
Even at this point, I wasn't quite ready to let my vision go... so I turned to my last resort.

I tend to think in terms of ability scores as a limit, with skills defining actual competency within that context. If you have average Dexterity and train to be an acrobat, you will be an average acrobat; you will be better than an untrained person, and you will be better than other average acrobats if you've had more experience, but you will never be better than a trained acrobat with high Dexterity.

People brought art-related books, and swapped on a one-for-one basis for books brought by others, as well as books donated by various organizations (there were a number obviously donated by the AIOC itself).

Being available is taking time out of your busy schedule to be with them. It means making them a priority, choosing to be with them instead of doing other things and being other places. It is fitting into their schedules, not demanding they fit into yours, or trying to squeeze them into your limited time. It is fulfilling your promises to them, being there when they count on you. Most importantly, it is letting them know how important they are to you and to God.

The Magnolia stamp is from the new Christmas collection. She is called Tilda with Hellebores. The corner frames are by Provocraft. The paper I used is fromThe Paper shelter and it is for the Happy ccouple collection I hope you like it as I had fun making it.

2. My actual dream job is opening my own store. I don't what I would sell but it would defiantly be clothing. I don't see this happening for quite sometime, but its going to happen.
We also have 2 events happening very soon: the first is our 2-day "Early Black Friday Sale" in which you can find some really great bargains from 10% to 40% off! This big sale kicks off on Friday the 18th at 10 AM sharp. The other event is our Men's Session that offers free knitting/crocheting lessons to those guys who have always wanted to learn. This 3-hour period starts at 11 AM on Saturday the 19th. With both of these events happening next weekend, the fully stocked shelves won't be full for long.

Leibbrandt had been visiting his neighbour Du Plessis at the smallholding on Wednesday night. Just before 21:00, Leibbrandt went back to his own smallholding.
Still, he said it’s no accident that after 40,000 college students raised $3.3 million to fight modern-day slavery at a January conference in Atlanta, Obama mentioned the effort in his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast.
Right now, panic and fear are spreading like wildfire in the financial world and nobody knows for sure what is going to happen next.
David Cameron was quick to seize upon Leveson’s remarks when facing the Opposition leader’s damning observations shortly after noon in the Commons, arguing that Miliband should “let the enquiry take its course”. But there are two gaping holes in this argument: why didn’t Leveson let the enquiry take its course, as opposed to intervening in such an inexplicable manner? And how can there be any excuse for a Minister who tells the House he is releasing all the correspondence about the enquiry…but is later shown to have left out all the incriminating bits?
“And why?”, I then asked.

Today Finn had his twelve month shots. Nope, you're not reading an old post. He will be two this month. Yep, I kept putting it off and putting it off, and finally made the appointment and got 'er done. I was expecting tears and flailing limbs, and he did cry especially during the last needle, but for the most part he was AMAZING. Oh, what? The last needle? Yes, he had FIVE shots. Two in each arm and one in his thigh. What a trooper. (Side note, what did we do in these situations before iPhones and kid apps? Probably saved me and Finn today.)

After the creamed corn high, the only direction available to us is back down hill again. If only dessert these days was as good as the Goat Cheesecake nirvana of yore. We order a pavolova that comes with meringue so rock solid and hard we would have been better off with pneumatic drill than a spoon. Pavlova is a dessert inspired by a ballerina. It goes without saying it should be lighter than air. The accompanying fruits including a stunning combination of the freshest cherries and nuttiest of almonds surrounded by smooth whipped cream are deliriously good. He knows how to source his ingredients, that's for sure. They could have stood up perfectly well by themselves, as a dessert in their own right, without some sugary over-cooked egg white as a prop.
It is hard being a missionary.
Meanwhile, Margherita and a pilot on leave from the Polish front named Hans (Bekim Fehmiu) have grown found of one another. The reason Helmut has bugged all the rooms (he has a team of flunkies listening around the clock) is because he doesn't trust the girls to make accurate reports of all the treasonous pillow talk they overhear. Disfranchised by the war, Hans openly shares his disdain for Hitler and Nazism in general, but Margherita fails to include his negative comments in her report (she doesn't know the rooms are bugged). Knowing that Margherita is hiding things from him, Helmut, instead of confronting her, decides to force her to have sex with his wife (Tina Aumont) on his couch. When he tires of watching their tan stockings intertwined with one another, he shows Margherita the contents of his spacious closet.

Anyway, I'm supposed to write Jermaine. I thought of that tonight while I was sitting at my friend's graduation party. The party was 80% family and then 20% friends, from the looks of it. One couple caught my eye, with their two month old son. The girlfriend was sitting in a chair, and the boyfriend squatted down next to her and put her feet up in his lap. It was just a random kind act that I observed, but it made me think of Jermaine. It made me want to tell him,

My Mom and I can't wait to pay homage to this fine, fine shop whenever we plan our Kalispell outing. There is something for everyone and in every price range. There is nothing like a fabulously laid out, colourful, warm, and welcoming shop to entice you into it's creative atmosphere!

She was telling me about her habit of lying and how it had become so ingrained in her as a person that it's taken all these years to really actively work to undo it. It's not big lies, it's stupid little stuff. She had a heart to heart with one of our special guests that we brought with us to the conference about this subject specifically. I love Diana sooo much for doing that because this is one area this kid struggles, and it has EVERYthing to do with how he relates to his dad. How he relates to his dad has everything to do with that quote above. There is zero trust built in that relationship.

By the way, the A. Smith Bowman Distillery in Fredericksburg, Virginia, is officially reopening on Thursday, April 19. It never actually closed, but hasn't been open to the public for several years. Tours are now offered Monday through Friday at 10 AM and 2 PM, or by appointment. Groups larger than ten should call first. The gift shop is open weekdays from 9 AM to 3:30 PM. They do sell whiskey there.
Don’t over-beat your mixture. I’ll say it again, DO NOT OVER-BEAT. This includes everything from your sugar and butter creaming to the final step. I know people think it’s ok to whip your butter and sugar into oblivion, and you do want to reach that creamed state in which it looks like paste, BUT if you overdo it, your cookies will flatten and your cake will not be so puffy. There is some kind of science-y explanation but basically you’re destroying the butter and not allowing it to retain the moisture you need to evaporate and make things puff up.

Hello folks! To celebrate the release of A Year Without Autumn, today I'm having the wonderful Liz Kessler on the blog!

it is said, is written by the victors. Trivia, meanwhile, is written by the guys with the smeared spectacles and the breathable rainwear. The first discipline is linear and causal; to quote from Alan Bennett’s play The History Boys, history is “just one f****** thing after another”. Things look different, though, when viewed through the prism of trivia. The past is reduced to one big coleslaw of fascinating facts that in their randomness tell a more mixed-up tale entirely.

I would like to take this time to thank each and everyone of you for reading my crap, providing me with entertainment, and understanding that sometimes a person just needs a little time away from the real world to express themself.

Dubbed the City Chicken Institute, the series is free and open to the public, and were developed after Rachael Brody, NYRP community outreach garden coordinator, approached bk farmyards — a decentralized farming network that partners with landowners to farm on their land.
So what’s to come after The Avengers? Well as well as The Avengers this year, there’s also Sony/Columbia’s reboot of the Spider-Man franchise directed by Marc Webb and starring Andrew Garfield as the new Peter parker/Spider-man. In the movie will also appear Dr. Curt Connors (played by Rhys Ifans) whose alter-ego The Lizard will be the main villain of the movie.
Some books are greater than the sum of their parts; The London Train is one of these. The novel is really two novellas about two different characters (Paul and Cora) who at first appear to be unconnected to one another. But of course that’s not the case and we see eventually how their stories wrap around each other’s. Both Paul and Cora are approaching middle age, have recently lost their mothers, and have unresolved baggage with their spouses, ex-spouses, children, friends. Both are adrift, rethinking their roles, trying out new identities. And their stories eventually intersect in a way that seems surprisingly inevitable.
Her makeup wasn't smeared so that told me she wasn't losing any tears on my behalf. Somehow, I was expecting at least a small amount of water works. There I go, flattering myself again.
Yeah. And it still has a view. And a balcony. And we can get a pet. OK, so just a cat.. but someone else in the building has TWO bull terriers and I think the manager looks the other way. Oh, and did I mention it's RENT CONTROLLED? Bwahahahahahahahaha. I'm sorry, was I bragging about my most awesome find of the century? Yeah? TOO BAD! I worked really freaking hard to find the best place possible, and this is a total win. We didn't time our move out too well and will end up paying a little on both places this month in pro-rated rent, but we're enjoying the leisurely move. We're looking forward to officially beginning our living there and painting! :-) Oh! And it's right down the street from our current place and we already love the hood and know the parking situation!

When coding a site to optimize its search results presence, you’ll want to include a robots.txt file somewhere in the root directory of the file system.

I can think of a lot of brands (and people) that would enjoy inhabiting that world. They abhor the idea of unwelcome attention.

My hat’s truly off to Christy and Morgan (and anyone else helping behind the scenes that week) at The Nashvillest, who did an outstanding job of collecting, organizing and getting information out on the Web through this whole ordeal that week and just really became the central point of Internet communication regarding the Nashville flood and continue to be. I should point out, too, that the website is not their job – they have full-time jobs elsewhere – yet they still managed to kinda outshine the local print and television news media when it came to the WWW. The local media still did a good job and continues to, but in this situation, they kinda got pwned as far as getting critical information out on the Internet goes.
Mother dearest and I went to see Mary Poppins today! It was really nice to spend the day out with her. She started the day in a bit of a down mood, so I was glad to see this change as the day went on. The show was at the Burswood Theatre, which is right next to the one and only casino in Perth. There is also a whole heap of entertainment venues such as restaurants and nightclubs nearby. As such, Mum and I decided to go in early. We both had a bit of a flutter at the casino – she came out evens and I came out $100 up. As such, I shouted Mum to lunch.

John Hiatt was great too, and the 88's were a ton of fun. The whole thing was only tainted by the Longhorn basketball team laying a steamer on the TV in the corner.

It is the world's largest vintage table lamp. No, really - the thing is a full 60" (5 feet!) tall from the bottom to the top of the shade. The body is ceramic, and there is a glass globe that the shade sits on. (The shade itself measures a whopping 19" across and 25" tall!) I wish I could have gotten a better photo of it, but the light in my office is terrible - hence my decision to bid on the world's largest table lamp. It does help quite a bit - and it has a 3-way switch so if I don't want it full on I can tone it down a bit.

The obvious conclusion from these extremely brief, but repeated observations is that a person should make a point of having some real human companionship several times per day. If, for some reason, they can’t do that they should have telephone conversations with a real live interactive person whom they do know as a physical entity. Perhaps even that is impossible, and then they should resort to artificial human contacts such as TV human interaction shows, and all of these relationships would be enhanced by having a companion dog.

4) The Good Shepherd Refuge. In the midst of the bustle and glamour of city life there is despair and poverty. The Good Shepherd Refuge on Queen St. East near Parliament St., will accept food donations 24 hours a day. There is a particular need for canned vegetables and fruits, tea and coffee, sugar, and rice. Many people, including myself, prefer this kind of donation because you know that your gift, and all of it, is going directly to those in need, rather than to administration.
And you will be faced with a choice.

Nothing much to talk about him. It is just that I realize this feeling would bring both of us nowhere because he is going to further his studies and meet many more beautiful and prettier girls. Plus, he doesn’t show interest in me even one bit like how obvious it is that I am interested in him. I did admit to him that I felt something for him and I think he was thunderstruck by the daring confession.

The also-rans of higher animal species beyond Homo sapiens do introspect: but rarely to the point of influencing very much in terms of the pecking order. Humanity is different because it has language, printing, and sophisticated media for communication. Thus, to go all Geithner for a second, ideas can be leveraged. If one columnist invents a phrase or word – like Sloane Rangers or Yuppies – 300 million people will know about it within a short time. What the internet has done is reduce that time from years to hours.
The Understudy is his second novel and is mostly inspired from his times training as an actor. Written in 2005, the novel did quite well both critically and commercially with The Guardian saying that ‘this bitterly funny book is a delightful reminder of how much acting we all do in the name of love.’ The book follows Josh Harper, who has been named the 12th sexiest man in the world is doing a play on the west end. For him, acting is fame. He is in new blockbusters, has a great apartment, and is loved around the world. Stephen McQueen is his understudy who is divorced and his ex now has a new partner and has custody of their kid. For him, acting affords him a bedsit in south east London and general unhappiness. When will his big break come? Maybe this isn’t sounding like the most gripping of books but it’s extraordinarily funny.

We talked to the new general manager at WHMP and "The River," David Musante. He's the son of the former mayor, and has only been on the job for a couple of weeks. He said I wasn't the first call he had gotten complaining about the station's' storm coverage. He said that much of the staff at the station were newly hired, and the storm caught the station off guard. They had just hired new local people like Bob Flaherty and Denise Vozella just so they could beef up their local programming. He said that when the power came back on, they went on with their regular programming, but cut fresh news breaks and updated them hourly and on Sunday afternoon they played a message from acting mayor Narkewicz.

Thank goodness for weekends. Honestly, it's nice to slow WAY down and just rejuvenate a bit. Each of my classes is reading a novel right now, so the lesson planning really varies.

Can't wait for that little break. I'm not really going anywhere this year, but I have a lot that I'll be doing around the house to catch up again.

Though I've done a little bit better with this one, I wouldn't say I succeeded. Let's be honest: I LOVE TO EAT. Having to cut out some of my favorites is hard. Breakfasts this past week were things like yogurt and fruit or protein bars instead of buttery scones. I call that a success! However, I still ate salty snacks with lunch and did my routine evening snacking in front of the tv, so I still have a ways to go. Baby steps, right?
Still,… a great example of “blame Obama for everything and anything” republican politics.

Further, the proprietor of a trade mark may, by virtue of the exclusive right conferred by the mark, oppose the resale of luxury goods on the ground that the reseller has removed their packaging, where the consequence of that removal is that essential information, such as information relating to the identity of the manufacturer, is missing. Where the removal of the packaging has not resulted in the absence of that information, the trade mark proprietor may nevertheless oppose the resale of an unboxed perfume or cosmetic product bearing his trade mark, if he establishes that the removal has damaged the image of the product and, hence, the reputation of the trade mark.

Before Korea, we visited pretty regularly from what I remember. At least once a year, and for a few days at a time. But from what I’ve gathered from the rest of my family, she’s been pretty ready to go for the last couple years. Problems with her joints, problems with her teeth, her vision, her back, etc. I think that’s a big reason why we haven’t visited recently. I don’t think my dad wants to remember her like that.

Eric and I hosted our 1st annual murder mystery dinner and it was a great time. We will be doing it again next year. For his costume he wanted to be a ghost, so, I made a 3 piece suit! That's right, I said 3 piece suit. I used Simplicity 4083 for the jacket and vest and I used my TNT pj pant pattern B5153 for the pants. Sorry the picture quality is so poor. I took this at the end of the evening, so there was no natural light and the costume was incredibly wrinkled. This pattern was very quick and turned out quite nicely! For the pants I pressed a very crisp fold down the center and no one even guessed they were elastic waisted pants. For this costume I used the 8.5 yds of white cotton twill, 3-1" white buttons, 7-5/8" white buttons, 3 yds of white fusible interfacing and about 1 yd of 1" white elastic.
I even just sent a tweet to one of my favorite restaurants who serve really great sandwiches, soups and most importantly pickles. And they wrap them up just the way I like it.

“No, no, they’re not too bad,” murmured Luigi, almost to himself. “But they must stop, and good tigers come out. So find the problem. I’ll be over here.” And Luigi leaned against a metal railing and stroked his own mustache, which was far more tremendous than the Shift Manager’s.
Apparently this disease has been around for year, but has only surfaced in the last decade (Since 9/11?) with stronger “strains”. According to the study the symptoms of (AGP) can start after a run-in with a government agency or institution, or when the individual is introduced to anti-government propaganda by a “patriot”.

7) HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL – Kenny & the Fiends
During this season of intense warfare, the one thing I won’t forget is how much God loves me. Last Thursday, (during a small group meeting at Sandy Powell’s healing class) the Lord literally through prayer and laying on of hands broke the back of the enemy. For years, fear of men, fear of failure, fear of being unaccepted and unloved rooted deep within my soul – to the point that I didn’t even understand how deep it was. The symptoms of this root always manifested around exam time, when I felt like I was being “graded” by others (including my Professors, peers, etc) for my performance. Law school is even worse because you’ve got one exam for the whole semester!
What are dissenters but smartasses? Socrates, “The gadfly of Athens,” was a smartass at heart, devoted to revealing the ignorance of those reputed wise. H. L. Mencken once said, “The cynics are right nine times out of ten,” and George Bernard Shaw said, “The power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it.” We need our cynics.
The slur and unforgivable sin which is attached to Tony Ward (apart from supporting Eddy Butler) is: (he has a) “wife of Chinese extraction, has worked extensively in Israel on military jets.”

I remember the first time I heard it, and I’ll admit, I was in my mid twenties which is late for a rock music fanatic such as myself, and to be honest I’m not sure why it took me so long to get into Pink Floyd in general, I was definitely missing out.

Then there's the old standby, the email campaign. There's any number of email blast companies online, and many self-publishing companies also sell email services--for instance, Xlibris's email marketing campaigns, which range from $349 for a multi-author campaign and 200,000 addresses, to a jaw-dropping $9,996 for a "personalized" campaign and 10,000,000 addresses.
The various reports are an attempt to cover up the cover-up. They know exactly what the undercover officers did. Bernard Hogan-Howe's report could, I suppose, try to use the excuse that it didn't look into its subject at all before coming to a conclusion and making recommendations. Hardly tenable from the new chief of the country's largest force.
She gasped and awoke. Through her darkened eyes she could see the sun rising over the bower and her husband looking at her worriedly, his innocent, bland, fireless eyes searching her tired, resigned ones. She couldn’t look at him and turned away. He wasn’t enough anymore. She should never have allowed herself to think that he’d ever be enough.

My brother died when he was 19, so what was the point in planning past that age? A person could die any day. Instead of focusing on my future, I thrived in the moment – partying my pretty little face off and giving little thought to my education or financial future. I was there for a good time.

Starting off on an easy foot, the mirrors open up the room. They give a depth to the shots, establish the location, and rather frequently a reflected character will be out of frame. It creates an excitement when we are allowed a peek into the off-screen space and see stuff outside of the frame.
Our first winter in Alaska was very mild, which was a good way to break me in slowly. This winter has hit and it is already CRAZY! I feel like all it has done for the past 2-3 weeks is snow. I don't mind it. I mean if it is going to snow it might as well snow a lot. They are really good about clearing the roads quickly (which is different from Oklahoma and Texas).
Are you, at least in relation to most of the human population, WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic)? Then it’s likely that culturally and politically you are a left-leaning liberal whose highest values are autonomy, self-realisation, social justice and fairness. And you are probably suspicious when people appeal to religion, human nature or the well-being of any non-inclusive group to justify their values and political agenda.

It was totally NOT what I expected. Yes, she was from Manhattan, but this book wasn't just about ditching city life for country life. Kristin's husband, Mark, has a vision: about food, about farming, and about community. These are not people who came into farming with a load of money. But they came into it with a set of core beliefs, and those beliefs have led them to create the first total-diet CSA.

I don’t think that I have ever yelled at a kid. Spoken strongly and seriously with lots of eye contact, yes, but even that rarely happens. We are usually homies and when I ask them to do something or not to do something they are usually respectful and acquiesce immediately.

This has always made me wonder about stats of my own and how fun it would be to go through those. This curiosity mixed with wishful thinking made me come up with an ideal that would be awesome to believe – That when you die, in what ever horrible bloody way that it may be; would it not at least make the idea of death less scary if you knew that once you walked toward that bright light at the end of the tunnel that you would end up in an infinite white room with the only feature a desk in the middle with a large hard cover book. Open up this book and you have every imaginable statistic on your life, for example -

An encounter with Def Leppard ends perfectly; another with Richard Misrach's photos and the Utah sand flats ends with a scene "like a contemporary monument to the Donner Party," where "a family car has sunk up to its axles in an area of sudden mud." Rebecca West's massive "Black Lamb and Grey Falcon" represents for Dyer a model of sprawling reflection on his own Balkan quest: "as a kind of metaphysical Lonely Planet that never requires updating." The strength of this admittedly diverse and diffuse anthology for all its "unruly" assembly testifies to West's disciple, another restless and engaging guide to one eccentric, lively, and unfailingly erudite, take on his--and perhaps our-- human condition.

So many things to blog about, so little time. There was a period this week where I didn't even tweet for a whole day, shock horror. Quick run-down so we're all up to date:

I do can feel happiness, sadness, anger, etc., but they are processed slowly. It’s not infrequent that I have to think rationally about what emotions I am supposed to “produce” and feel in certain situations. Most “brain CPU time” goes to the rational parts.
Middlesex has large students numbers, with contemporaneous programmes running in Hendon and Mauritius. Each of the 4 Schools have a full-time Learning and Teaching Strategy Leader. 24 departments supplied 4 modules each for the project, and a departmental coordinator to cascade findings. Learner Development Unit is student facing and works in the area of academic practice including preparing students for e-assessment.
For all of the music’s acumen, a theatre was a bad choice of venue. Used to performing in “artist squats and clubs”, the Sunflower Theatre proved an unfortunate place for Checkpoint 303’s debut Beiruti appearance – a dampener on what would otherwise have been a far livelier evening; an overly intellectual environment for intelligent electronic music. The over-stuffed velvet seats and their stock-still inhabitants made for a sadly staid atmosphere. The venue needed to be less stuffy and much more grimy for the music to really take a hold.
The word Torah, means utterance, teaching, instruction or revelation from Elohiym. It comes from horah, which means to direct, to teach, and derives from the stem, ‘yara’, which means to shoot or throw. There are two aspects to the word Torah. Aiming or pointing in the right direction and or moving in that direction.

My heart broke when we got back last night, to which we immediately unpacked. We turned around to find Oliver asleep in Josh's suitcase. It was a strong reminder, "I'm sick of you always leaving, and if you do it again I'm coming with." I instantly felt bad. Is this his way of trying to remind us to not forget him? Or is this me over-reacting to nothing. Just a comfortable place he randomly found?
Whenever I take the time to pick out some paper, tune up my printer, go through all the image adjustments, test prints, and finally make a print of one of my photographs, it's eye opening. It's almost like the photo never fully existed until it was printed. It's as if that digital file is only a blueprint.

The top card uses Ranger enamel accents and the bottom one opal liquid pearls. You can see that the enamel is a much sharper white. The sentiments come from an awesome new Imagine That set. It is perfect for classy masculine cards without sports stuff on. OK so mine are bright and not classy but you can probably see the potential!

I’ve probably said this before, too, but Hubbard is one of the very few musicians of his generation who has actually gotten better with age. He’s now 65 or thereabouts, and I can’t wait to hear what he sounds like when he’s 70. Truthfully, this album, plus A. Enlightenment, Snake Farm (2006), and Growl (2003) make up a body of work that, for my money, is unrivaled by any other singer/songwriter I can think of.
And you entered my dreams again, but I couldn’t control them, and I didn’t remember them. Just frightening, scattered images when I woke up, and I’d always wake up four or five hours later.
You don't get days out anymore. There used to be a car and Mummy and Daddy took you places with swings and slides. Swings, slides, light through the leaves and being happy slip further and further away until you're not sure there was ever a world beyond beige walls with no pink to hide in to bear the slaps, pinches and pushdowns that are your new routine. You're sure you remember your parents though and cry for them every day. You don't know the reason they can't come to visit is that now you're a hospital resident 80 miles away from home and the car had to go because you're no longer entitled to the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance and the Motability scheme. Mummy and Daddy are getting older and they had to care for you instead of going out to work. You don't know they're going cold and hungry now they're unemployed not carers, you only know that no-one comes to see you except the people who hurt you.

Still, it left us with unfinished business in France. We will, DV, return this year and do a proper job of it. We have booked a flight to Paris via Doha on Qatar Airways for the 23rd April, to return on 1st June. Come hail, heat or snow, we will stick to the most pleasant task of wending our way through the French countryside. From Paris back to Paris. Along the following route: (as a broad outline only)

Thai spicy dressing...although, not overpowering my salad! I already had some fresh veggies from Whole Foods, and the organic fresh ginger, so I was all set for my project...sick-and-all, just eagerly wanting to eat fresh spicy squid salad! All I needed, was a little creativity, which I still had the "spark"...and a beautiful salad was created...I felt a whole lot better after that, and since then!

... and here's the one for her twin brother Massimo. The owl colours are closest to the correct colours for both of these photos - I'm not sure why the quilts and bibs look so washed out.

Carter: Yes, they’re still of my two favorites. Mohler: Well I wanted to kind of ask you, how did you come to know of them and how do those theologians in their influence—how did this impact your thinking? Carter: Well I know you know a little about Georgia history. When I began to run from public office, Burt Lance, who served with me when I was governor of Georgia, gave me a copy of a book by Reinhold Niebuhr called Reinhold Niebuhr on Politics, and I pretty well studied that book and learned as much as I could about the proper relationship between, you know, religion and politics and how they were not incompatible, but that you shouldn’t use religious authority to exalt your own particular faith. And then I kind of deviated and got onto Paul Tillich later on and enjoyed him very much, so I would say that those were the two theologians that I got to know earlier. Now I have a pretty good collection of others, but I still go back to those two because I’ve known them and they’ve kind of been absorbed by me as part of my beliefs. Now I have about eight or ten books either by or about Reinhold Niebuhr. Mohler: A very seminal figure. Of course, his idea of moral man and immoral society, as his Gifford Lectures became known, really did help many American liberals to recover some sense of sin during the twentieth century. And as an evangelical, I would want to believe more than that, but never less that than. I would say a little bit of Niebuhr would be a big corrective in a secular age.
Is everyone keeping busy this summer? Sheesh! Ever since Mr. Yarnworks returned from Afghanistan in May, it's just been crazy around here! Between Shepherd's Harvest, spending mad quality time with Mr. Yarnworks and the kids, toting the kids to and fro to basketball camps, dance camps, and outdoor camps, and getting Mr. Yarnworks' ACL and meniscus repaired (finally -- he injured it a year ago!).....well, let's just say that I took most of the summer off from most everything except my family. And I enjoyed every second!

Hello everyone. I hope you are all doing well. Sorry I've not posted in a while or been visiting. As some of you know last week was Sean's Birthday and our 28th wedding Anniversary. Sean was home from work for the entire week and we spent a lot of time together which didn't leave me much time for crafting or blogging. I will be around to visit all my bloggin buddies to see what you've been up to. I know I've missed so much but..... my week was totally awesome.
