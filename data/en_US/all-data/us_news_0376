But there's one memory that will forever remain my favorite. After the ranger talk would wind down in the evening, everyone would turn toward a cliff high above the valley floor.

The film is based on an idea from espionage/action specialist Luc Besson, whose interest in the genre seems to know no bounds — writing, directing, producing, sometimes merely thinking. Some of that inspiration, and execution, is better than others — "La Femme Nikita," "The Fifth Element" and "Taken" fall into the better category — with Besson directing only a few of his brainstorms.

Kings: Los Angeles was a "sleeper" team when the season began. And just like San Jose, they spent the last week trying to make sure they wouldn't miss the playoffs. And just like Phoenix, the Wings owned the Kings, winning three of four meetings, outscoring them, 18-11. Jonathan Quick is a very good goaltender and the Kings are stingy defensively, but they're also stingy about putting the puck in the net they're supposed to put it in: They averaged 2.30 goals-per-game, and to put that into perspective, that's worse than Columbus. So, pretty much a ditto here: Start on the road, yes, three-time zone difference, yes, but this is also an opponent the Wings should master.
The desperation is as obvious as the frustration. The Red Wings must win Game 4 tonight.
The March jobs report showed a gain of 120,000, about half the monthly gain from December through February.

Jha'Tier Robinson, 17, a Cleveland School of the Arts student, said the speech boosted her faith in county government.
It follows logically that if faith-related organizations are allowed exemptions from insurance mandates based on their beliefs, so should other employers. And yet this is the best argument for exempting no one. There might be employers whose convictions include the belief that overpopulation is a moral evil; should they be allowed to deny maternity coverage? And what about the rights of employees, most of whom pay a portion of their premiums? Why don't their moral beliefs come into play?

Inexplicably, one of the most vocal arguments from opponents of Amendment 4 is that it would (horror of horrors) change the way representative democracy works.

His grades already had slipped from A's and B's to F's, and Grimes said he was losing weight. His problems at school seeped into his home life.

At the same time, the debating Republicans may for once focus more on Mr. Perry than on Mr. Obama. The Texan's rivals will have their first head-to-head opportunity to smoke him out on his controversial views on social and economic issues, and how he handles himself under hostile fire. Mr. Perry's rapid rise in the public-opinion polls has already shaken perceptions of the GOP presidential competition.
"SO, we should open our homes and our pocketbooks to people we have never met," railed one person, who then raised the prospect of murderers, robbers and perverts.

“It’s my first year doing (the dash). I pretty much did it just for fun … I kind of eased up at the end but when I saw people catching me I said I can’t let that happen, so I put in my all just for that last moment,” said the junior who edged Centennial senior Tessa Seale by the slimmest of margins: .01 of a second. In hurdles “when you get off the block you have to go straight up. With the dash it’s like a progression: You slowly bring your head up, so it’s kind of weird. I feel kind of empty when there are no hurdles there.”

Still, Alvarez's statement said: "The contradictory statements made by witnesses seven years after the actual incident do not allow us to discount the statements that those same witnesses made to Chicago police detectives during the course of the initial investigation and within weeks of the incident.

"None of us expected to play as many minutes or be responsible for wins and losses as we were," said Evans, who said the experience gained last season was invaluable. "With so many losses, it weighed on us. That kind of halted us from bouncing back in games and closing out games at the end because we were one, inexperienced, and two, we didn't know how to close out games and didn't have the leadership. This year, it's completely different."

The book grew out of those cooking lessons with her mother-in-law (with whom she gets along famously now), but also features some specialties from other parts of the Sephardic world. Persian cuisine revolves around rice, and another hallmark is the combination of the savory and the sweet, evidenced in Simnegar’s pomegranate paste-infused stuffed grape leaves, the stuffed Cornish hens with rose petal sauce, and fish stew with a tamarind twist.
"We have to approach it like (the Blues aren't here) unless we did what we were able to do. ... Everybody feels that way. It just comes down to numbers some times. If I don't play a game the entire playoffs, that's fine. I still feel like I'm part of this."
Izzo worried, late this season, that the Spartans were not a great rebounding team -- and that was with Green, one of the best rebounders MSU ever had. (He became the career leader in boards, ahead of Greg Kelser, in his final game.) If Branden Dawson regains his explosiveness after knee surgery, and Payne continues to develop, and Nix loses another 10 pounds, they can grab the rebounds Green got. If Nix and Payne can play together -- maybe the biggest "if" of all -- MSU will have a frightening front line.

'The Last Warner Woman" is a "splendocious" story, told "crossways." Jamaican-Scots author Kei Miller's second novel about a Jamaican woman who "warns" -- that is, foretells the future -- is a rich stew of Caribbean patois, folkways, religion, prophecy, magic and mesmerizing, circuitous, self-conscious storytelling. Miller, who is also a poet, circles around his truths, teases out just-right words to hint at elusive meanings, and ends the novel by acknowledging that in every book "the story within breathes its own breath."

After spending $110 week after week for classes like mine, students graduate, typically, with about $20,000 in debt, only to realize the realities of employment. Despite all my full disclosures in the classroom, they are shocked to find that there really isn't a job waiting for them and that their diploma isn't necessarily the guaranteed route across the (un)employment gates. In fact, trade guilds often add and require their own training and certification.

(On the reasoning for working out Matt Kalil)- "Anybody that we are thinking about taking at four, we want to know the most we can about them. We have always done that. You can read into stuff about workouts and bringing guys in. The four is a little different but when you are picking everywhere else you try to bring in guys you like, but you also like to bring in guys you have major questions about or some questions no matter where they are going to be in the draft. When you are talking about the fourth we try to do our homework obviously on everybody."
But Merkel is quick to point out that every situation and every estate is a little different. She cites one instance last fall when she combined two estates into one sale.

His work with R.E.M. on “Murmur” in 1983 had established him as a man with a talent for making underground bands palatable to mainstream audiences without stripping away their rough edges. DiNizio saw Dixon as a kindred spirit — and may have used some enterprising sleight of hand to enlist the producer to the Smithereens’ cause.

A: Really slowly. After we finished touring for (2008's) "Ohio," I took a little break and started to focus on painting a lot, something I'd set aside for about eight years, so I was mainly painting every day and working on that in a dedicated fashion. The notion of songwriting really wasn't part of my thinking. A painting can take a year to create, so things developed slowly. Eventually it got to the point where it was suggested by (producer) Mark Nevers that we work with him.

Plot lines: You thought there was hand-wringing over the offensive line? Fans (and coaches, too) are concerned about last season’s defensive front and its inability to stop the run. The fact OSU didn’t bring in a ready-made starter at defensive tackle from the junior college ranks was a concern. And 6-3, 351-pound run-stuffer Castro Masaniai adds to the angst as he recovers from a broken leg.
There is no question, Erik, that when a person becomes a minister, rabbi, priest or other religious leader, he or she does not lose the capacity to participate in partisan political activities. However, any activity in support of or in opposition to candidates for public office must be done in a manner that doesn't indicate or imply that the religious figure is bringing the weight of a religious institution behind him. It also means that that church leader cannot utilize the resources of the church to promote his personal partisan views.
