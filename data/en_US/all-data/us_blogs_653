Opinion: It’s a bit passé. Sorry, Denise. It’s an overused French name which has lost most (if not all) if its original cultural appeal. If looking for a French name, opt for Elodie, Genevieve, Louise or Coralie instead.
The woman was about five feet in front of him, clutching the knife tightly in her right hand. Her eyes were steely and locked onto Ben’s every move. The lines of her body were contoured into an athletic looking frame, poised and ready to strike. She could be on him like a jungle cat, stealthy and quick, that he was well aware of.

Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, announced this past weekend that it is planning to send a manned mission to the moon by 2030, reports RIA Novosti. The space agency said that it will start off resuming its lunar activities by 2015 by using an unmanned space ship. Roscosmos head Vladimir Popovkin voiced back in January that the agency desired to set up a manned moon research base with European and U.S. partners. Popovkin said that there were plans to either set up a moon base, or to launch an orbital station around the moon.
“Isn't it odd how much fatter a book gets when you've read it several times?" Mo had said..."As if something were left between the pages every time you read it. Feelings, thoughts, sounds, smells...and then, when you look at the book again many years later, you find yourself there, too, a slightly younger self, slightly different, as if the book had preserved you like a pressed flower...both strange and familiar.”

My task , should i choose to accept it and I do , (lol) is to start with small things that cause me anxiety like taking meesha out for long walks or getting on the bus or even groups and spend time before i leave visualizing the whole event from start to finish. As i feel my anxiety rising I open my eyes and breathe and ground myself then start over and try to get further in the visualization than the last time.

However, The Times has established that there is no scientific evidence to show that the bags pose any direct threat to marine mammals.
Earning more than R3m a year places Malema among the country’s top earners. Although their packages were propped up by performance bonuses, Malema’s income through the trust was on a par with the salaries of Investec chief executive Stephen Koseff, who, according to the Sunday Times rich list, drew a salary of R3.5m in 2010; Mvelaphanda head Mikki Xayiya with R3.2m, and Basil Read’s Marius Heyns, who earned a salary of R3.1m in 2010.
So we bought potty's and put them in the laundry, which is right next to our toilet and bathroom area. I am pleased we did now, as they seem to be sympathetic toileters!! Like as in, if one wants to go, the other follows and go's too!! Which is good for us too, you get them both out of the way at the same time, and it limits the amount of trips I had to make to the potty's and the amount of time I spent sitting on the floor , singing and reading books!!

A week ago I received an e-mail from my friend Ian Maloney who runs many of the literary reading events at St Francis College who asked me if I wanted to read Friday night at a Brooklyn Non-Fiction event at the school. I said yes and sent a piece I had written about Greenwood Cemetery- to the moderator Aziz Rahman. Before I knew it I was a finalist on the program with seven others for the big prize.

This read wasn't a complete bust for me though, because Burns' art is an incredible, inky, dark work of beauty. I really enjoyed the experience of turning each page to see what artistic wonders could be found. Rarely was I disappointed. The nature of Black Hole's plot requires that Burns draws everything from the mundane to the insane and he does both incredibly well. I only wish there had been a great story to go with the art.
Mommy shrugged, sending the pink tulle at her shoulders fluffing out. “For all intents and purposes, yeah. But,” her smile crawled back on her cheeks until her lips looked like a cut in her face, “I do a pretty good job of being both, don’t I Keith? Fooled you, even.”
Though I have gone there many times, I am yet to see a tiger. Or maybe I am better off not seeing one. Even the people who live in these parts are also quite reverent about the royal inhabitants. For I have noticed that they never say the word ‘tiger’ directly. Always they talk in third person while referring to them. I hope that I get many more chances to enjoy these ambiguous forests in future…

Firstly we’d like to say a big well done to the wonderful people at Something Kinda Cute for their success in organising today’s fair – let’s hope it becomes a regular event because it really was rather marvellous… Well planned, excellently produced and run without a single hitch, plus a huge number of visitors through the door due to their expert marketing and promotion. Really fantastic – thank you for all your hard work and enthusiasm running this superb wedding fair.

Since it first emerged as a proclaimed environmental threat in 1989, global warming has become one of the most contentious and hotly debated scientific theories of the modern age. Yet for all its headline-grabbing controversy, climate change is hardly the first or even the most insidious hoax of its kind. If anything, it has been kept alive in the public sphere to perpetuate taxpayer ignorance of a far more overwhelming, trumped-up, ravenous-baby-eating-liberal pseudo-science scare.
First of all, I could not believe I have not posted for so long! I have been very distracted with the interior house painting going on around here. We have made some progress is all I can say.

A few years ago at Pole, a bunch of guys buzzed another guys head in his sleep as a prank, and he didn't notice it until someone pointed it out to him . . . three days later. There's a myriad of other stories like that, people completely disconnecting. People walking into the wrong bedroom, undressing and going to sleep in it, not noticing that it's not actually their room. People going to the galley, eating lunch, but if you grabbed them walking out and ask them what they just ate, they'd not be able to tell you, if they could recall eating at all. Someone here related a personal experience to me of simply not being able to remember anything he'd done for days at a time when he was wintering at Pole.

We were inseparable. It was like a movie. I won't go in to all the smooshy details. But there was lobster, and champagne, and a summer spent together camping in the Pyrennees, and boating down the canals of Gent. I never wanted to leave, but had to, to go back to my job.
I don’t know why they call them worms because they are more like big fat colourful caterpillars, but they emerge from these tiny eggs and start eating leaves straight away. Climbing on top of each other to reach the ends of the branches. They eat so much and so fast that you can almost see them growing before your eyes – if you stood there for a while. When they reach the end of the branch they drop to the ground and start marching caterpillar style to the next tree. Within days the largest is the size of my index finger. And the trees are stripped of leaves again – naked as they were at the height of the drought. Their first attempt at summer foliage is sacrificed to the needs of this hungry horde.

He got us there early last night, to show us photos from the last 2 trips out of school & from the 'ritterfest'** last week which seemed to have included lighted candles (and we're not talking tea lights in jam jars here, they had serious naked flame action going) and sword fighting as well as carving meat off the bone - if the photos I saw were anything to go by anyway, 3 things which would surely make any UK teacher run for the health & safety handbook. We seemed to sit through the photos at least twice as Herr B let it roll round again and again for the 'latecomers' (why d'you think they were late? Clearly planning on missing out that bit of the proceedings).

If you’re anything like me, you’ve probably never heard of Mary Rogers before. Mary Rogers was kind of like the Paris Hilton of her day—not because she was a stupid, spoiled whore, but in that she was famous solely for being super hot. Renowned all across New York City for being the attractive young girl behind the counter at Anderson’s Tobacco Emporium, Rogers’ murder sent a shockwave through the city, the story dominating the newspapers for months. Stashower uses this real life mystery as a launching pad to dissect the political and social climate of the day, unveiling an American culture of which I was unaware, yet mirrors our own today.
Fortunately, things have greatly improved now. Many brewers have started cellar quality initiatives, and the Cask Marque scheme has done much to drive up the quality of beer handed over the bar. It’s now generally accepted that cask beer should be crystal clear, 100% of the time, and any failure of clarity is sufficient grounds for a refund or exchange, no questions asked.
It’s about time. Just kidding. Well, I went to film school at Georgia State University in Atlanta. When I was there, I fell in love with cinema and never looked back. Before that, I made movies with my parent’s VHS camera when I was a kid. My brothers and I made a series of films called ‘Hacksaw’, about a serial killer. We even made a sequel to that, ‘Hacksaw 2′. We understood the importance of a movie franchise pretty early on.

Matilda enjoyed the kid splash zone with the water slides that were just her size. I think if she was four or older she would have enjoyed that area even more, but she also seemed to enjoy just being held in the pool or sitting in her floaty with us in the big pool.
Sunday night, I mapped out a 3.1-mile course. The area where I run is made up mostly of pugmill trails rather than asphalt or concrete (the picture above is one of the less-rocky trails). It's a hilly area, with an elevation of up to 1300 ft. The course I mapped out was about half uphill, half downhill. The first mile was along one specific trail, and the next 2.1 miles included three laps around a 0.7-mile loop trail.

I spent some time poking around the back of the long back pond again, it’s tough going back there! The brush is so thick that in many places I couldn’t bust my way through, and in any of the openings, the briers, brambles, and other prickly plants made walking unpleasant. I did find large numbers of wildflowers that are about to bloom, but other than that, just more game trails.

A search on COCA suggests that as good or better than – seemingly the most common of these expressions – appears especially in magazines and newspapers, often as quoted speech. But academic occurrences are not unheard of, and for as well or better than are of comparable frequency. A few examples:
A Fear-Self is a sub-persona that is created by the psychological self as its strategy to protect itself from the trauma of the Wound. We are driven to create an array of fear-selves to deal with the shifting demands for self-protection as we navigate ourselves through life. What we are really doing is playing a very sophisticated game designed to prevent us from re-visiting the vast childhood trauma of the Wound.

Saturday we got up and ate breakfast at Cracker Barrel- I love their apple butter and biscuits- and then headed to the mall in search of an outfit for an exciting event coming up for me. Hear me, ladies. My husband HATES shopping. Like, everything about it. He doesn't like to be overwhelmed with lots of different decisions at once, he despises spending money, and he especially hates shopping with ME because I'm so indecisive. We haven't spent much quality time together at the mall in the four and a half years we've been together.
Though I have said this several times before, here is a brief recap of what happened.
Today, the 15th of April 2012 is a very special date for James Cameron and me. For me, it is a special date, because it is the day on which I have posted my 100th blog post in my blog. For James Cameron, this date has a significance on account of the tragedy that happened on the 15th of April 1912: the sinking of the what was then thought to be the unsinkable TITANIC in the icy waters of the Atlantic and the loss of 1517 lives in that disaster. It can’t be just a coincidence that my hundredth blog entry is happening on the hundredth anniversary of this disaster and that this blog post is about the movie based on this disaster!

He wasn’t done yet, either. He had his best teams up to that time in 1982 and 1983, with the ’82 squad finishing 40-8. At that point another power arose in the Southern Conference, as Western Carolina hired Jack Leggett to upgrade its already promising program. The Catamounts would win five straight league titles, a stretch dovetailing almost exactly with a gradual decline in The Citadel’s fortunes on the diamond.

Realize that slavery is the new freedom. When you die to your selfish desires, you become slaves of God, which frees you from sin so you can live life full of blessings. Understand that the way to truly experience freedom isn’t by gratifying every appetite you have, but by gaining power over your appetites so they don’t enslave you – which you can only do when you’re a slave of God, who wants what’s really best for you. Remaining enslaved to your own desires will eventually destroy you. But when you become a slave of God (the only master you were ever meant to serve) by practicing submission to His will, unconditional obedience, and self-denial, God sets you free from sin, sanctifies you so you can grow spiritually, and gives you eternal life.

It's been a while since I gave an update on our bathroom renovation. With the winter holidays over and the hubs and I back at work full-time, we've slowed down a bit. I'm thinking we should be completely done by the end of this week. Let's hope so because we have family coming into town on Saturday. Nothing like an impending visit from the in-laws to light the fire under our bums! For the record, my MIL is wonderful, but of course we want the house to look great for our guests (and we want to show off our handy work).

They cannot sleep, they cannot eat, they cannot rest; the people have been issued a long awaited life certificate. Commonsense has trumped corruption.

Now is when the course really opened up. We began a rather long run, probably 1.5 to 2 miles through a rather beautifully flowered trail. I’m not sure precisely when but right around this time one of our team members had a real bad hamstring pull. He just stopped moving and had a real hard time even bending his leg. Out of fortune, a fellow Tough Mudder came by who happened to be a physical therapist. She asked to help and my friend said alright. It was kinda funny because she is kneeling down with her hands up his shorts giving him a deep tissue massage while other Tough Mudders are running by wondering what in the world is going on. I was jokingly saying, “Nothing to see here, nothing to see here, just keep on moving”. It was a rather humorous time during the race but she apparently worked wonders because he was a lot better afterwards.
Still at least I've now worked out why I couldn't see half this stuff. And now I can - mostly - see them.
In the movie, Queen Elizabeth I time-travels 400 years into the latter part of the 20th Century on the 'wings' of Ariel, summoned up by astrologer John Dee. But enough explication. I don't want to ruin it. It is by far the best British movie ever. And that's it.
And speaking of terror, how about that Vermont Country Store catalog? I've gotten used to the idea that the homey purveyor of old-time staples -- like other catalogs aimed at aging Americans -- is selling sex aids along with the bunion pads and caftans. But when you sell a "personal massager," for whatever part of the anatomy, it pays to be sensitive about language. You probably shouldn't keep insisting, for example, that the product boasts "pinpoint accuracy." (Ouch.)

Andy is the lead investigator on Ben’s murder and is responsible for who is questioned and how the investigation is handled. How he handles the investigation will later be called into question once Jacob is accused, and Andy is put on leave from the D.A.’s office. When facts surface that indicate Jacob murdered Ben, Andy uncharacteristically destroys evidence and stonewalls the investigation. As his family struggles to maintain a normal life through the trial, Andy must confront the demons of his past to set his son free. The themes of self-preservation and survival were examined when Andy and his wife were forced to confront that they may have raised a murderer.

And, worse than wishing for our “if only” is when we do get to that point and achieve what yesterday’s “if only” was, we quickly start again, wishing for a new “if only”. We don’t take the time to enjoy what we do have and what we have achieved.
For those to whom these feelings overwhelm, experience steps in and they/we create, consciously and unconsciously, conditions in their/our life that send them/us spiraling into the dark night of the soul and the supreme realization at that point is that change is an experience. That, perhaps, there is more to life than what we have previously known, that perhaps drugs aren’t the way out at all. Perhaps there is a bliss beyond the sexual orgasm, a physical contentment beyond that provided by the comfort foods that we consume daily. That experience is not bounded by what we’ve experienced before. That there are new experiences out there, new forms of perception, new forms of sustenance, new forms of living, of loving, of experiencing life in its variagated aspects.

Moe’s conference marked a watershed moment in school privatization. His first “Education Innovation Summit,” held last year, attracted about 370 people and fifty-five presenting companies. This year, his conference hosted more than 560 people and 100 companies, and featured luminaries like former DC Mayor Adrian Fenty and former New York City schools chancellor Joel Klein, now an education executive at News Corporation, a recent high-powered entrant into the for-profit education field. Klein is just one of many former school officials to cash out. Fenty now consults for Rosetta Stone, a language company seeking to expand into the growing K-12 market.
The Bass and Allsopp samples are very close to the classic Pale Ale gravity of 1065º. Before you say "what about numbers 3, 4 and 5?" you'd best read the next quote:

We had our first vacation away from Riley in early August. We were fortunate enough to go to Mexico and enjoy the beach for three days. Really it was three nights and four days. It was nice to get away, but I missed her a lot.
I’d make it easier to stop commerce than start it – easier to kill jobs than create them – more fashionable to resent success than to seek it.
General Dad took his final flight in the KC-135 aerial refueler Friday afternoon and everyone came out to watch him land. As soon as he came down the ladder, my Super Mom and little brother (backed up by all of my sisters) hosed him down with a high powered water hose thanks to the firetruck that was parked on the flight line. This tradition was so fun to be a part of!

Here, the words your wife suggests that whilst the writer was trying to write for a female readership, in their mind the reader they were trying to please was male. Generally speaking, only male readers will be able to identify with those moments when your wife walks in.
The family of Mary Stuart in Daughter Am I truly helped create her. When Mary found out that she was the heir of grandparents she never knew existed, she had to find out who they were so she could find out who she was. Once I set the family dynamic, that determined the character of Mary. Her father was close-mouthed, wouldn’t talk about why he disowned his parents or why he told his daughter they were dead. He also bonded more with his daughter’s fiancé than with her. The mother seemed to be mostly a shadow of the father. Because of this, it was inevitable that Mary got engaged to the guy they liked, and it was also inevitable that she dumped him when she became her own person. And even that “own person” was created by family — turns out she was just like her dead grandfather, with his set of values, a desire to build his own life despite social conventions, and an intense loyalty. Even her “adopted” family helped create her. As she followed her quest to learn about her grandparents, she accumulated a crew of travel companions — all friends of her grandparents — who become a new family of sorts.

What I love in this book are the characters the author created. They're so real to me. And the way Nicholas Sparks wrote the novel helps me understand the characters better. Sometimes it was Steve's point of view, sometimes it was Ronnie's, Will's and also Marcus'.
Obesity and overweight conditions usually lead to pre-diabetes and diabetes type 2, which can also cause kidney disease. If dietary habits remain the same, high blood pressure and artherosclerosis (clogged and hardened arteries) can occur, leading to heart attacks and strokes.

It turns out my son got pulled over by the police. There had been a robbery and his car (my former car that I gave to him) matched the description. B said the police had the loudspeaker going and all... handcuffed him and threw him in the back of the police car. They had the drug dogs, too. B told them to search the car, because he was innocent. They tore the car up and found nothing. Finally, they got a radio call that the robber had been caught, they apologized to my son and let him go.

Eventually, however, Kenyon came to question his model. He recognized that even if it could explain the origin of biological information, he still needed to explain the origin of DNA as well as how protein synthesis transformed itself from a self-organizing and self-originating process to one that depended entirely on DNA transcription and translation. He dismissed the possibility that proteins constructed DNA because the information flow in modern cells is unidirectional, and it’s in the complete opposite direction: information flows from DNA to proteins, not vice-versa. Because DNA wholly determines the amino acid sequencing of proteins, and because there is no evidence suggesting or reason to think this order was ever different in the past he eventually abandoned the protein-first model. DNA must have come first. But based on his knowledge of its chemical properties, he doubted that DNA possessed the same sort of self-organizational properties he thought were present in amino acids. He was forced by the evidence to abandon his proposal that life originated by necessity.

I had not. It was the worst kind of limbo. Although I loved every single minute I lived in Japan, I was eager to start the next chapter of my life in my true calling. Teaching English was fun, and I made a really good living doing it, but it didn't feed my soul. I felt like I needed a job that did. And a Master's that would allow me to do so.

At its core, The Lost Wife is a heart-wrenching love story that tells not only the unforgettable relationship between Josef and Lenka but also the love within family and friends as well. Through Alyson Richman's skillful writing, I felt every emotions evoke in me (I still do) as I read about Josef's and Lenka's love story as well as the misery and pain the characters have to face and endure during the Holocaust. This story has the ability to smile and cry at the same time; and what I liked most about this story is aside from the love story between Josef and Lenka, it is the courage and the resilient spirit of Lenka which what makes The Lost Wife such a memorable reading experience for me. On the other end, I was also moved by Josef's patience and determination of seeking Lenka throughout the years without fail (and his letters to Lenka, in which most of them are returned mails, made my heart melt).
Tear-gas, as well as a foul liquid called “The Skunk”, which is shot from a water cannon, is often used inside the built up area of the village, or even directly pointed into houses, in a way that allows no refuge for the uninvolved residents of the village, including children and the elderly. The interior of at least one house caught fire and was severely damaged after soldiers shot a tear-gas projectile through its windows.
Our prize this month is this fabulous set of 3 stamps from La Blance which would make great images or backgrounds as they are lovely big stamps.

The 2009 Alma Negra Misterio ($40-$45) is a red blend and may contain Malbec, Petite Verdot, Merlot, Bonarda and Cabernet Sauvignon. Ernesto wants to keep the blend a mystery, to prevent any preconceptions based on knowing the grapes involved. It is primarily in the U.S. where people constantly want to know the grapes within a wine. Only 1000 cases were produced, and it has an alcohol content of 14%. The wine had a sweet spice aroma, with hints of blackfruits. On the palate, it was decadently smooth, with a complex melange of spice, vanilla, blueberry, ripe plum, and more. It was well structured with a long and pleasing finish. A hedonistic wine meant to savor, and which does not require food to enjoy, though it definitely would pair well with a fine steak or hearty dish. I was very impressed with this wine and highly recommend it.

I have been waiting for the sequel to the first Jessica book for quite awhile. I read the first book and the web story and have been anticipating this book for quite some time. I can't help but feel that this raised my expectations considerably. There are several things that make this series great: Jessica's strong personality and a leading lady, Mindy (enough said) and the relationship between Jessica and Lucius. The sequel feel a bit flat as we really don't get to see much of Jessica and Lucius. The majority of the book they are separated physically but even when they are together there is an emotional block in their relationship. I realize there is strain in the storyline but I find it odd that Jessica finally gets married and turns into the timid mouse she is portrayed as in the book.
Definitely an odd setting for an awards program, especially given that this was also the first Oscar show to be broadcast on television. But the International was owned by NBC, who had agreed to fund the inaugural broadcast. And NBC's fees to broadcast the program were especially valuable to Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, as the film studios had refused to fund an elaborate bi-coastal show.
We went back to the hotel, I let Trev lay down with the babes, and I took the other six swimming. I felt like the Zombie-bride….trying to smile, trying to interact with the little kids when all I wanted to do was get in the shower and cry.

The likes of Stephanie Messenger, who want to teach children to “embrace childhood disease”, and have to mislead them (deliberately or otherwise) about the facts to achieve that goal, provide about the biggest challenge out of anyone I ever try to empathise with. They want to make the western world’s relationship with preventable diseases more like that of Africa, before a major vaccination initiative on that continent started saving around 300,000 lives every year.

The pharmacy called me on my way home to tell me my insurance won't fully cover one of the medications. More great news, right? When I got home I decided to call my bariatric practice. I spoke to the NP, who was really understanding and thinks we need to redo the upper GI. I completely agree. She says I should still meet with the surgeon to talk next steps. They call me back to schedule for next Thursday since that's the one day he sees patients. I literally cannot make it when he is available. So I unleashed. Not in a mean way. I just broke down crying. I cannot fucking eat. I'm vomiting. Why don't they care?! Everything I've read and learned about the band says this is NOT. GOOD. I'll be meeting with the NP I spoke to earlier next Wednesday during the time the other surgeon will be in the office, which is nice as a back-up if there's something she's not sure about.
America promised a reward of $5 Million on osama and ended up spending more than $2 trillion.US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could cost taxpayers a total of $2.4 trillion by 2017 with mounting interest costs as the war is financed with borrowed money.About $1.9 trillion of that would be spent on Iraq, or nearly $6,300 per US citizen.

And yet...
It's lunchtime, and I'm sitting in the food court restlessly picking at some wedges. At the table next to me is a very old man in need of a tan eating some scran as part of his calorie plan. He has a flip book on his table, precariously balanced on the edge of his tiny eating space, with bits of pages highlighted and crossed out, a manifesto for life that would be more impressive if he hadn't just dropped 1/2lf a pound of fried rice on it. Deftly he scoops it onto the floor where later a harried cleaner will pick it up, and only if she's having a good day will she forget to swear about it. I hope she blames the mess on no good punk teens - she could not have been more wrong. Personally, I can't entirely empathise with the old man - it's hard to empathise anyway listening to Josie and the Pussycats on an IPOD - because I'm more concerned about the state of the new book shop. 1nce a gleaming corporate paradise, it now has boxes piled up everywhere, in front of the music books, and the nice man who used to listen to pleasant classical music on his IPOD all day long seems drained of life by the incessant playing of Deep Forest and a thin old woman who appears every so often in the store to seemingly pore over profit projections. Poor guy - from Prokofiev to Profit Projections faster than you can say promotional book launch. Soon he'll be wearing bunny ears at Easter or be dressed as an elf at Xmas and the whole thing just won't feel right with me. I might have to buy my books at KMart and avoid that horrible woman with the grey curly hair just...just a horrible thought. The old man certainly couldn't care less, he's busy dumping a pile of rice on the floor the size of a small country, some of it landing on his shoes with a grumpy greasy thump on his brown shoes, which he doesn't even notice in his haste to highlight another passage of his flipchart. I consider him for a moment a sort of Ned Flanders figure, only much older and wrinklier and more sauce on his cardigan. Sort of sitting around, finding passages in flipcharts to censor and bring to everyones attention - but just as I'm able to subtly crane my neck over to see what he's doing, a woman gets her foot caught in the escalator, and a crowd of ambulance chasers trample over my dinner in a bit to get a front row seat to the carnage...

Dabies are too often tiny, cold-blooded creatures. They require swaddling cloth and must be nestled safely against the warm bosom of their owner. Dabies would rather perish, suffocating between breasts, than be cold. About.com concurs.

Rachael Stevens : After S Club were disbanded Stevens signed a £1.5 million solo four-album deal with Polydor Records and re-signed with Fuller. Stevens said that breaking out on her own after success with S Club was difficult: “I think we (S Club) ended up conforming to what people’s perceptions were. This one was the ditzy one, this one was the singer, this one was the dancer. And to come out of that and be a whole person has been a real challenge for me. I didn’t have my say, really, in the group. None of us did.”
What was my reason? Not thrill I can swear to that. Was just rebellion. I had wanted to prove to Childa albeit in my head that, I was a man and not the doormat she took me for simply because I worked for her father. There’s now probably a child…

But imagine the benefits if you get it right. An auto mechanic who’s smart about data could tell you that your fan belt is due for a change in 2,500 miles and suggest doing it today to save future labor costs. An airline that knows more than just your frequent flier number could propose a seat based on your past selections, offer discounted upgrades tailored to your preferences, and let flight attendants know you prefer tomato juice to orange juice in the morning–even if you’re just flying coach. If they’re really paying attention, they could even learn whether or not to offer you an upsell, and in which categories to do it.
Is that how we need to end every conversation, even when things seem copacetic?
Gambaccini denies the allegations and is reported, under intense questioning from the police, to have offered the same anecdotes about a life gone to waste, a powerful singing voice, and favourable comparisons with Mariah Carey, that he had exclusively remembered for all news networks, newspapers, and any passing blogger with a microphone, on Sunday morning.
More than just a reference book, That’s Life tackles basic biological principles and covers key topics on the biology curriculum such as ecology, food webs and other nutrient cycles.

The Cretan diet is famous for being very healthy, tasty and nutritious, the rich soil ensure an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables, which they prepare in simple but delicious ways, honey is important not to mention fish. All this is washed down with copious amounts of olive oil! (on average 25 liters per person annually!) The Greeks love to grill, be it vegetables or meat. Although you can expect a variety of different meats/ fish, I believe the huge quantity of meat often served in Greek restaurants in Holland is largely to cater for the Dutch people and is not particularly representative of Greek cuisine.

The means by which must be achieved is through the ballot box, with an annual referendum. The budget must, each year, be submitted to the people for approval, and comes into force only once approved. The politicians must make their case, put their arguments, and then ask us for the money ... and they have to say please. We, the people, decide whether they get it. We, the people, have the power to say no.

* Speaking of Heart of Wisdom, the website and ebooks have been a great source of inspiration and ah-ha moments for me recently. The Bible first approach at the core of it articulates so well what I was trying to figure out this year. I knew what I didn't want, and had a fair idea of what I did want, but the Heart of Wisdom Teaching Approach helped me fill in a few gaps in my understanding and simplify my (very complicated) picture of our ideal homeschool. The free guide to choosing and using resources renewed my confidence in my choices of what to read and not read with the children. I am adopting the HOW concept, but am not following Robin's 4 year plan or using the unit studies. What we are doing, I will write about more next year, as it's a work in progress. In the eyes of the kids, it will flow on well and look similar to this year, but in my head and on paper, it's somewhat tidier :)

At L’s wedding, S and I, not in the wedding party, talked about how we’ve all grown apart. I said “If I were to get engaged tomorrow, I have no clue who my maid of honor would be.” I don’t see anyone enough to give them that role. Since then, she and I have been making an effort to get closer. But after all the time, it’s hard. It’s hard to weigh the value of hanging out with each other versus seeing our boyfriends. It’s hard to go back to our old friendship when we’ve both changed so much. I don’t know how to be a bff anymore.

This would ensure that sackings are fair and lawful and the Party is not left open to defending expensive legal proceedings.
I always stress in my writings about nature and taking pictures if it catches your eye and curiosity, but you are not sure of what it is; take the shot and figure it out later. In this day and age of digital photography it cost you nothing to look at it later and you may get something interesting and if not it cost you nothing to throw it in the trash. I say this because I did find out what was using the air hole and what had made the tracks in the snow. I was walking out of the park, about to cross back over the bridge when I saw my little friend swimming in the water, then run across the frozen expanse of snow and ice and climb up the bank and begin to cross the expanse of land just before the bridge leading out of the park to get to the other side. It was a weasel and it was moving fast and not willing to pose for pictures, but I was snapping away by instinct. I got some shots of him on the ground and some of him lying on a branch in a tree where he has an entrance to a nest. They are not going to win me any prizes, or get me any offers from magazines, but they are proof of a good time and what can been seen when spring takes over from winter in Parc des Rapides, a marsh, wetland area, or a national park. So do not limit yourself to summertime if you enjoy being out in nature, simply dress appropriately and let your imagination be your guide and your love of nature warm your soul.

The house became silent; there was a cock of a gun. I turned and shifted back into my car. My heart tripled in speed. The door opened and tall slinky man came out with a gun pointed at the spot where I just came from. He looked around, even walked a few feet up and down the street before going back inside.

And as for my little mental challenge I posed earlier, as long as your instruments give you an indication of the windspeed and your current glide angle I don’t think it’s too difficult… Convert the windspeed in km/h into m/s by dividing by 4. Call this “w”. If you’re in a 1 m/s thermal then then as long as your glide angle before the thermal was greater than w then stay in the climb. If not, leave the thermal and carry on. So, if the wind is 20km/h, then w=5m/s, so if you’re in a 1m/s climb and your glide angle was better than 5:1 then stick with it.

Stories are loved by children. Bed times or long drives are the best way to bond with your child. To keep a child interested, proverbial stories work wonders. It can of course be put to use while relating to routine doings in life. Proverbs and idioms can be done to gradually make the child understand about right and wrong. Deep meanings are difficult for kids to realize and proverbs simplify the same. Important needs like caring, sharing and valuing money can be put through with proverbs.

My first reaction was what did he tell him, thinking please Lord I hope he didn't tell him anything of significance. That information made me realize that I cannot seal myself off perfectly - ever. Stupid Google, FB and even Twitter - I cannot guarantee that I won't find myself face to face with a man that would likely make me soil myself or just bolt. Hopefully I just turn and channel Kara Goucher and hope that no one is with me because I'm going to be one seriously hot mess after it all.

We will also receive a glorified body like that of Christ when we are raised from the dead but I want to remind you that to be born anew begins now, before death.

I spent three weeks with various friends in the UK and Germany and one week driving around Iceland on my own.

Usually I will begin a story with an image, or sometimes a phrase, which intrigues me, and a vague situation. I will know that the image/phrase and the situation are connected in some deep thematic way, although not necessarily how – that's the point of writing: to find out how. In 'Daniel Smith Disappears off the Face of the Earth', for instance, I had the idea of a teenage boy walking home alone at night and the image of the cold planet hurtling through the universe; in 'The Way to Behave', I had the scenario of a wronged and vengeful wife and also the image of the elder tree with all its witchy associations (and was therefore dismayed when the image of the tree was dropped in the abridgement for a BBC broadcast of the story – though of course I completely understood the restrictions which broadcast must impose). With these stories, and nearly all of the others in the book, this was enough to trigger me haring off into the 'dream'. I say 'haring off' but then I very often have a couple of false starts – sometimes a few – because the first line or so always has to feel absolutely right for me to carry on without hesitation (although of course, even when I've thought it was absolutely right at this stage, I may go back and change it afterwards).
And yet on the other hand ... it's a new day, another chance to do it right. On top of that, to remember that it's Friday, well, hooray. Hooray for me. Hooray for Fridays!

And after the trip to Neuschwanstein, we were all hungry and tired and so we headed over to Paulaner am Nockherberg. This is the epicenter of the starbierzeit, the holy grail, as it were, of knock-you-on-your-ass beer. I managed to drink one and a half litres, the boys ordered three each but honestly only drank about 2 each. I ended up dancing on the table at one point. (Hey, everyone else was too!) I've got a couple of hilarious videos on my phone of us drinking beer and me being attacked and tickled by a very drunk German. I will download them and post them once I figure out how.
In some incredibly sad news, Adrienne Rich died last night. Rich was a poet, an author, an activist, an inspiration. There are so many eulogies flying around the internet at the moment, one of which tells us that:
Recurring notions of loss, remembrance, questionings of “what next?” and imaginings of meeting his maker, Ferrio – vocals somewhere between a Springsteen and a Petty – eulogizes in a way that is both universal and yet wholly personal given the story at the core.

I picked up a single of BBPA at the local Total Wine store on Saturday (not wanting to blow the dough for a full six pack in case my suspicions were confirmed) and on Sunday, I popped the top, and poured the contents to find a sour smelling, floater infested glass of tangy pumpkin ale, not at all in a league with their previous year’s efforts.

I have resolved therefore to embark upon a nationwide tour in search of the real true Ireland. I plan to take in every single county and every major townland, village, convent, farm, and bar in my quest. I have already packed my Tupperware box with sandwiches and filled my Thermos flask (with Bisto, of course!), and Miss Whipcream and Jane Bondage have promised to keep an eye on my home in my absence, dealing with post, burst pipes, death threats, unmarked packages that appear on bank statements as "Runnymede Entertainment Enterprises," and the football scores. I have asked them to record for me the Champions League final so that I do not miss Real Madrid beating Manchester United 6-0 at Wembley, but I espect I shall be able to watch it in a field in Fermanagh, hopefully surrounded by cows. With silver linings.
Paul’s use of the word acts (literally “works”) connects this list to his frequent reference in this letter to the “works of the law.” They are not one and the same, of course. But the tragic irony of the situation is that while the Galatian believers are trying so hard to do the “works of the law,” they are actually producing “works of the flesh” (NIV: acts of the sinful nature). This is another way of saying again that the law has no power (as the Spirit does) to overcome the destructive influence of the sinful nature.

The breakdown of international trade after World War I changed this situation in the Nordic countries as in many comparable regions, and the specific ‘Nordic model’ of the thirties seemed to confirm Nordic separatism - although paradoxically it was based on international ideas of socialism and Keynesianism. The Cold War and the prolonged trade protectionism after the war stretched this isolationist period even further, and it is first at the end of the century that these decades, from the twenties to the fifties, can be seen as a parenthesis in the process of globalisation.

Today is my nephew's 17th birthday. He's a good kid, probably the "best" kid our family has produced in relation to not doing stupid things, not using drugs or alcohol, etc. But he's depressed. He has been for years, its part of our genes, his father (my bro), his brother, his sister, his cousin (kev) his aunt....we all have it. So when I look at this sweet kid, I understand that its GENETIC for many of us and medication is a must! I just worry about this nephew, he's already been hospitalized once for suicidal ideation. (though to read his FB page he portrays himself as happy go lucky).
This is the case with any branding initiative but it's a lot easier to dissect the fruits of someone else's labor.

Fortunately for this industry, a creative solution can clean up any mess.

Second, why is there never any blowback for the agent? An author whose overpriced book tanks will have a hard time moving into the front row again, but how is it that editors continue to do business with agents who convince them to pay ridiculous prices for books? I know, I know, it’s an uncertain business—but a broker who convinces clients to buy stocks that crash soon finds that no one will deal with him. What magic spell prevents agents from being blackballed?
For me at least Del Norte is really a nod in two directions because I live in between the place where Del Norte beer is crafted and the place that Del Norte beer is attempting to honor with their Mexican style brews.

Wow Jamie taken on a lease is a big deal, and proper management takes a lot of work and time. There is a lot of research and planning to build it effectively. Your first steps is to learn more about hunting deer before you begin spending time and money into the land you will be hunting. First you need to do some scouting start as early as may watch the deer from a distance: behavior, where they come from where they go to, what they are eating, time of day etc. Don’t worry if you don’t see any bucks your gonna want to hunt the does when the rut kicks in because that’s where the bucks will be. Any way once you have a good feel for what the deer do on your property, begin looking for sign in the mid day where you observed the deer look for travel lanes and trails leading to and from cover. Get back into this cover walking slightly off the trail I like to walk in pretty deep look for a slight clearing that might be 10×10 yards wide something that will give you some clear shooting lanes. Set up a trace mineral lick that you buy from a feed and tack shop don’t spend a bunch of money on a “deer lick” at Cabelas in a spot that has clear shot from a good treestand tree. Use block topper for the first application to help deer find your lick then once they know it there you wont have to add more. Set up a trail camera on the lick about 20 feet away something that doesn’t have a flash. Wait 7-10 days then check it if you have good activity like deer hitting it consistently keep it out if not find a different spot. Once you are getting good activity leave the camera out for 2-3 weeks at time and continually going to swap out cards batteries etc. keep a log of the deer you see on the cam you will be able to pattern them form the pics (time of day, temp, moon etc) This is a good way to attract good deer and will be ready to hunt in the early season . and will continue to b good through the season
Now Newkirk gives viewers a large empty podium in LAXART, a platform for voices but without one. All surfaces are mirrors, even the steps leading to the top are mirrored. Atop the rostrum, a mass of silver spray painted microphones. The podium’s back drop is a small stage backed by plastic strips of silver, the stuff of pompoms and victory. Yet the back drop is small change compared to the challenge of the podium. The mirrors dare you to step up and say something. Of course, no one in a gallery is going to unless it merely to amuse their friends so the coda of “say something” simply hovers in the room. The mirrors serve up a double dose of this challenge -- not only do you see yourself in the mirror as a possible solution to the silence, but the podium, in being mirrored, threatens to disappear entirely. If you are like me, this could turn you shy.

Often the booth fee can be an indication of a show's success. For one, shows with higher booth fees have bigger advertising budgets. Most of the shows I do fall in the $75 - $150 range. Shows that are cheaper are sometimes poorly advertised, with fewer attendees -- and lower profits. Shows that cost more require that I sell a lot more just to break even but they normally have a good track record and are worth the risk. This year, I'll be applying to 2 shows that are new to me -- and they top $200 in fees -- cuz I like living on the edge! Really, I don't think they're that risky -- both are in the summer in tourist destination communities and have been around for over 30 years.

That means even more research on the plans our companies are offering to see which we should choose and whether we should keep individual health insurance after we marry or transfer to an employee + spouse option in March. We also decided to enroll in a legal service offered through work so we could use them for our will and power of attorney fun that we have to set up for this trip, and for a pre-nup that says I, Tara, will get everything should Mike ever decide to travel solo.

When we inspected the hives at Hughenden Manor yesterday, the pollen being brought in seemed particularly vibrant in colour. We saw bright yellow and also a bright orange. I’d not anticipated such generous pollen loads with the days of heavy rain we’d had. A field of oil seed rape may account for the yellow. Implication is that honey bees go mad for OSR so the fact some were visiting something else was interesting in itself.

One of the points of criticism for the Christian faith in our day and time is the tension between our confessed tolerance for all people and their backgrounds and beliefs, and our commitment to evangelism. While we know and cannot turn our back on the fact that Jesus commanded us to go into all the world and preach the gospel, does our approach and methodology match with the way Jesus Himself went about it?

Not only is Francesca's life filled with danger, but it is also filled with romance. There is one steamy love scene in the Papal office that is un forgetable. There is man that lives near Francesca who is a glass blower. He has a son, but his wife has died. Francesca realizes that she has feelings for this man. His name is Rocco and his son's name is Nando. Rocco and Francesca have feelings for each other, but Francesca will not admit to her feelings for him. Rocco wants a mother for Nando. He gives Francesca the opportunity to voice her feelings, but she will not. He tells her that he is going to marry Carlotta d'agnelli. Inside, Francesca is very sad and longs to be the kind of woman that could be a mother and wife.

David’s work resulted in 650 cherry-picked music locations and with a number as big as that it’s easy to get your head in the spin deciding where to go and what to see. David shared his favourite location with us: “It’s a house (‘Brookfield’) in Surrey, England, which I knew had been owned by and became an inspiration to rock star Stephen Stills. But the more I researched the more I discovered. Firstly, it’s the most beautiful Elizabethan mansion, but it’s recent history included Peter Sellers owning it and the Beatles reforming there after George Harrison left briefly when Ringo Starr owned the place. It gets a two page feature in the book”.

By saying that, I don't want to suggest and I don't want anybody to think I was suggesting that racism is no longer a problem in our society. It is, of course, still a very real problem in our society and in our lives - and we can see that very easily by looking at the case of Trayvon Martin. And here I'm not even really concerned with George Zimmerman, with the shooter himself. I'm more concerned with the reactions to the event.

For the past several days of Vacation Bible School, the children were encouraged to bring their parents, grandparents and friends to this Sunday service. Today, they would parade into the sanctuary, assemble in front of the altar and perform songs in culmination of all they had learned during the week. To the delight of the congregation, they sing songs about God, of course, and about loving one another. And just as many generations have sung before them, they often sing about the joy, joy, joy, joy down in their hearts and about being happy, so very happy. The last verse of the song really gets them excited.

Which gets me to thinking about my girls... even though they are a lot older... they are just as lovely... and I can't help but spoil them over the holidays.
Tris suffers so much throughout this novel. With having to kill Will, and her mother and father sacrificing themselves for her at the end of Divergent, Tris is wracked with grief and guilt, to the point where she actually struggles to function normally. She becomes terrified of using a gun, throws herself into unnecessary reckless situations, and simply can’t get past what has happened. This puts a lot of pressure on her relationship with Four, who loves her beyond words, yet can’t seem to shake her out of her self-destruct mode. Add to that the fact that he's suffering from his own demons and seems to be hiding things from her too, and you’ve got yourself a hurting couple who need each other more than they can possibly say, yet can’t help spitting fire and venom at one another. It is so unbelievably sad knowing how much they feel for each other and just how much they desperately need each other’s help, and to then see them feel unable to simply reach out for the other’s hand. It’s incredibly sad. Saying that, when no harsh words are spoken, the fire that burns between them rivals that of any other YA couple going. The chemistry between the two of them is so intense, it crackles right off the page. This is what makes them one of the most believable YA couples going; they have the love, the passion, the devotion, but they have their issues too. No relationship is perfect 100% of the time, and the fact that these two have their problems makes it all the more real. Their relationship is so beautiful, it shines.
We had lunch in the beach cafe and at last all three dogs were quiet and orderly as they waited for sardine heads to descend from the table.
There is a real appetite in Uganda for the execution of homosexuals, not only because the government endorses such backwards views but because lies are spread about homosexuality. Lies that have a classic ring to them, as they were once used (and still are by hardcore bigots, idiots and certain Daily Mail journalists) here in the UK: homosexuality goes hand in hand with pedophilia, it's effects your lifespan, sexuality as a choice that thus can be cured etc.

London -- Russians born during the Leningrad Siege in World War II, which was responsible for some of the greatest losses of civilian life in history, are giving scientists new strategies to identify people who experienced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and starvation during childhood at greatest risk of developing long term heart complications. The abstract study¹, presented at the Frontiers in CardioVascular Biology (FCVB) meeting, in London, UK, 30 March to 1 April 2012, makes use of a unique population of people exposed to extreme starvation both as foetuses and during childhood.

Birds… Keep an eye out for discarded shells as you walk through woodland. Many young birds will have broken free of their eggs to start new lives, calling to their parents for food. Nightjars and spotted flycatchers are among the last migrants to return to the UK. Nightjars use open woodland to nest in. Spotted flycatchers are renowned for their aerial insect catching abilities in woodland glades.

The actual show ran from 7:45-10:11 last Saturday. Nearly two and a half hours of course some of that was filler. Fact is for the full show to be shown and given the coverage it deserves at least a two hour slot was needed. That would put the show on par with its American counter part.

On August 24, 2008, Ambrosio and her fiancé, Californian businessman Jamie Mazur, had their first child, a daughter named Anja Louise Ambrosio Mazur, in Florianopolis, Brazil. On December 27, 2011, the couple were confirmed to be expecting their second child, a son.
I'm so excited to be a mommy again. I'm due November 19th. So far this pregnancy hasn't been too bad. I felt super sick and tired starting at 7 weeks and then felt better at 10 weeks. But my sister was still living with us at the time and was super helpful. Not bad at all! I can't complain. With Grayson I was sick until 16 weeks. I'm hoping that means this one is a girl! :)
remember that class you took back in 2008 on advertising? where professor Mike Whittle mentioned the agency Saatchi & Saatchi? you’ll get a job offer from its sister company. don’t worry, though inexperienced, you’d still get a chance! again, trust your guts. and moreover trust God, cause that’s what this year is all about.
In piecing the story together, Onesimus had wronged his master, Philemon, according to Philemon 18, and consequently fled; a runaway slave. Had you been a slave in that day where would you go?

This intriguing melange is a description of Alma Negra (which translates as "black soul"), a wine project of Ernesto Catena, the son of the renowned Nicolás Catena Zapata. While I visited Argentina, I got to meet Ernesto and tour the lands and winery of Alma Negra, all of which were compelling for a variety of reasons. Ernesto straddles the line between science and art, having a computer science degree from Tufts University in Massachusetts (giving him a local connection) as well as a design degree from the Domus Academy in Milan. Yet it is his passion for beauty, his affinity for Japanese aesthetics, which seems to be his most significant motivation.
And for God sake, avoid SUBJECTIVE ADJECTIVES (beautiful, gorgeous, lovely, handsome, sexy, smart, ugly.) No matter the point of view, these descriptions are subject for debate, not facts. One person’s “Fugly” is another person’s “Hot damn!”
Rape. To say this show uses rape in a disgusting manner is an understatement. It never uses it for pornography or anything, but it is presented with a lot of intended titillation. Firstly we have the antagonist Tsubaki, or Sixth. During the show she’s the nearly blind leader of a cult, but her backstory basically boils down to ‘her parents died and so the head priest had her gang raped by the entire cult as a child’. When she captures Yuno, she decides to have her raped by the cult too instead of, y’know, just killing her. TOTALLY FUCKING NECESSARY. But of course Yukiteru saves the day and more importantly for the fans Yuno’s virginity. That isn’t even an exaggeration. Later on the duo that is Seventh are introduced. A pair of lovers, Marco and Ai are inseparable and constantly looking out for each other, and trying to kill Yukiteru and Yuno. Back when they were in high school some girl that didn’t like Ai had her brought out to an abandoned factory and gang raped by a bunch of high school boys BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY FUCKING HAPPEN AND OBVIOUSLY NOONE HAD ANY QUALMS OR ANYTHING ABOUT RAPING I MEAN JESUS FUCKING CHRIST FUCK THIS SHOW. Worst of all, the presentation of the rape scene suggests that there is censorship that will just fucking disappear for the BDs. TV ONLY CENSORSHIP. IN A GODDAMN GRAPHIC RAPE SCENE. THE MAKERS OF THIS SERIES ARE DISGUSTING PEOPLE. Fortunately, there aren’t any more characters to who this happened to, so let’s dissect what we have to find out just why it’s so awful. Firstly, ‘rape-as-backstory’ is incredibly lazy writing. It’s an easy and cheap way of garnering sympathy, requiring little in the way of actual characterization. It is nearly impossible to handle well, and the way they did it in Mirai Nikki was far from it. It didn’t feel like a realistic turn of events given the setting and context. Doing it once and failing to write it well will get you deserved scorn and criticism. Do it more than that and you are (not even look like, you are) a shitty hack writer and terrible person. But it doesn’t stop there, oh no. Note how both Sixth and Seventh were, if not outright stated very much implied to be, virgins before they were raped. Note how they were also both antagonists and possibly evil. Note how Yuno, who escaped being raped, is very much stated to be (and it’s apparently important she is) a virgin and while not necessarily good certainly not evil and definitely a protagonist. DO YOU SEE WHAT I’M GETTING AT. There is this implication there that being raped makes you evil, and ‘pure’ individuals are fundamentally good. Excuse me, but HOLY FUCK THAT IS DISGUSTING. I don’t even want to elaborate any further. This show fails to write in rape well and does so in an absolutely horrible way.
Moving on from heavy subjects, if you are looking for a fresh thriller, you should pick up ‘Sister’ by Rosamund Lupton. You would love the eloquent, pitch-perfect writing of Rosamund Lupton and she beautifully creates characters who are as vividly alive in your mind as many other real people. The story is about two entirely different characters but very close sisters and how the elder sister Bee doesnt accept her younger sister Tess’s ‘suicide’ and how she unravels the mystery. Surprises await at every turn and the climax was UNBELIEVABLE. I thank my dear friend Janani for suggesting this awesome novel of such a high caliber. It is a must-read…

In the introduction, James Hunter (himself a noted Scottish historian) remarks “universal themes can sometimes best be understood by studying their local impact”. This runs contrary to how history was perceived for many years, but is an approach that I personally identify with, and have been inspired by in Richard Reid’s historical writings.

That’s a helpful reminder, because sometimes we tend to compartmentalize our lives. Perhaps we pray only during church worship, small-group Bible study, family devotions, and personal quiet times. But what about during our workday? To pray on the job does not mean we have to fall to our knees with clasped hands and pray aloud. But it does mean that work decisions and relationships can be brought to God throughout the day.

Daily prayer: Father, we who have received Christ early in our young years are grateful for the solid and lasting foundation we’re building that will provide comfort, solidity, and needed perspective when we approach the golden years of our life here on earth. The older we get the more this earth and all that it has to offer grows dimmer while the lights of glory grow ever brighter. It happens because our eyes are fixed on the eternal city not built with human hands but fashioned and designed by the Builder of the Ages. Keep us true Lord Jesus, for there’s a race to be run and there are victories to be won on this side of heaven. We pray this in the name of Jesus. Amen.

Spring is my favourite time of the year, although here in Tenerife, the change in Season is not quite so marked. Spring though, longer days with the promise of summer wafting in the air. Spring a time of birth with lambs making their appearance and rebirth as the flowers start to grow again. Spring, a time of hope and promise.
But that was all ego. It didn’t want to deal with the shame, the guilt, the despair, the fear, the pride, and the anger. These may be the body’s natural responses. And yes, I felt the whole gamut of feelings, the bleak depths of which I did not know existed. How can people survive this, I wanted to know. It was painful. I wasn’t eating. I wasn’t sleeping. All I did was cry.

The trash that lines the sides of the make-shift roads along with what can only be described as scattered human debris is almost unnoticeable when you’re caught up with the concentrated panning of your vision, left to right and back again.

*** Not to pick on North Carolina, but ... well, okay, so maybe I am. An agent from the state's Department of Health and Human Services, who was inspecting a Raeford elementary school, confiscated a pre-schooler's lunch this week. She claimed it didn't meet USDA nutrition guidelines. And what terrible lunch did her mother pack inside of that paper bag? A turkey and cheese sandwich, (gasp!) a banana, (horrors!) potato chips, and apple juice. Criminal, huh? Oh, don't worry. The poor child didn't go hungry. She was provided with school-made chicken nuggets. And a $1.25 bill. Talk about invasive! The agent's superiors say they don't know why the lunch was confiscated, because it appears to have met the guidelines. Know what? Even if it didn't meet the guidelines, at what point did that agent have the right to stick her nose into that child's brown bag? Good thing nobody did that when my kids were in school. I probably would've been arrested. Not for the food, but for the contraband ... the stupid pictures, notes, and corny jokes I used to write on their napkins. (Ya see, some of them were in very bad taste.)
With the new age mentality man can do anything given enough time, enough money, enough technological advances. One thing humanity is forgetting: God is still on the throne. Remember the words of Psalm 2:4. “He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.”

Hey girls! Sorry about the loss of power thing. This is the 4th time we’ve lost power since being at Ft. Bliss, but definitely the longest we’ve gone without power.

The only one who sees past it all is the mighty Sidney (Neve Campbell who stars even without plastic surgery addiction) who, like all chastened lovers in films, comes home on a book tour for her self-help memoir. Sidney's self-serious pout and moistened eyes show she's secretly well-aware that the only one who survives these events takes them super seriously, but even she doesn't bother to employ standard dirty fighting tricks until all of her friends are dead. The rest of the cast lives only for their death scenes and have all the survival instincts of Yvette Mimieux and company when the horn goes off and morlocks come calling or one of them almost drowns (above). It's mildly scary when the SCREAM kids encounter the killer but once they're stabbed and bubbling blood out their mouths, there's no longer pain or tragedy --they become merely actors game for a throe, even tossing off bon mots right before their death rattles.

The all-new Sony Pictures Animation holiday themed mini-movie, The Smurfs™: A Christmas Carol (which is available exclusively on disc with the Holiday Gift Set) is being integrated into the wildly popular Smurfs™ Village app (available for free in the Apple App Store and Android Marketplace). There are a variety of brand-new holiday-themed quests for consumers exclusively timed to the release of The Smurfs™ movie, such as helping Brainy Smurf grow blackberries for holiday Smurfberry Nog and helping the village build a SnowSmurf. Inspired by the mini-movie, the app will also feature Smurfette as the Ghost of Christmas Past, a Santa-dressed Papa Smurf, and Brainy Smurf as the Ghost of Christmas Present. And all of this is set against a special Christmas-themed holiday backdrop of snow-covered mushroom houses full of holiday cheer. On the Apple App Store: http://bit.ly/duoQW6.

Another editor might take your story and rewrite the first two or three paragraphs so that the story's spur fits more snugly into their receptor. The interesting thing is that within a story there might be elements that are at variance, or that constrast with one another. Because of this dialectical tendency in the West - the play of opposing views in any one space - you can switch (or 'segue') from one track of a story to another track. In this way, the concepts built into the spur can logically lead (using grammatical elements like 'but' or 'however', just for example) to other concepts that are related and that actually hold the message that you want to communicate to the world. Journalists talk a lot about 'transitions', meaning those parts at the beginning and the end of a paragraph that enable the easy movement from one idea to another. Note the 'easy' part: it's important.
Milan Petrović: With the trend of rise in numbers of Slavic pagans and increased visibility of Slavic pagan religion in society one should expect certain changes or at least an effort for changes among Slavic people. We should be able to observe (hopefully in near future) strengthening of environmental awareness and support for renewable energy sources and sustainable development among Slavic people (since most Slavic pagans are concerned about their environment, which is result of Slavic religion being nature oriented and earth based) and some lesser political consequences (as most Slavic pagans are at the same time panslavists, drive towards some sort of Slavic union would become somewhat stronger). It is my most sincere wish that atmosphere of religious tolerance should be achieved between Slavic pagan religion and Abrahamic faiths, and that gross images of recent years of Slavic pagan temples, shrines and holy places destroyed, burnt and desecrated by Christians would finally become thing of past. Hopefully non-pagan Slavs will understand that Slavic pagan religion is part of their ancestral legacy.

In all probability, conditioning to reach your current state of athletic prowess has involved extensive participation in this or other sports (e.g, dating and/or marriage). You are no doubt versed in the basic tenets of the game. But this is prime time, buddy, and let me clue you in: you aren’t in Cornhusker country anymore. You are standing on a field in a stadium filled with no fewer than two dozen screaming fans and an enraged quarterback who is, make no mistake, also the head coach.

If you have actually been in a vineyard or around grapevines, you may have a mental picture of the vines and branches being thin and easily broken, but those in Israel back in Jesus’s day were thick and strong. The image of the vineyard or the grapevine is common in Scripture. God had provided for and chastened Judah and Jerusalem throughout the Old Testament. If there ever should have been a vineyard to the glory of God, it should have been that nation. However:

Those who opposed the Matthew Shepard Act in the manner they did were defeated, because it is indefensible to argue that a law should not protect a particular group, however, that is what the law already does and why the law itself is indefensible. The exclusion of whites from the protection of hate crimes legislation is indefensible, and results entirely from bigotry and racial prejudice on the part of the left wing zealots who drafted the law.

As we talk about our opposing ideas, the topic drifted into the probably the most famous international organization around; the United Nations. Well basically, he’s for the UN and I am against it. My friend argued passionately for the UN since he believes that the establishment of such organization is essential; because he firmly believes in the supposedly good intentions of the post WWII nations while I, on the other hand, disagree and believes that if this particular organization cannot be abolished fully, its role must be reduced dramatically.
For once, I’m actually looking forward to my next visit with my doctor! What a difference six months, and some applied effort can make!
Or Anaïs Nin, who had as the thesis of her classic Delta of Venus the idea that truly titillating erotica "must be mixed with tears, laughter, words, promises, scenes, jealousy, envy, all the spices of fear, foreign travel, new faces, novels, stories, dreams, fantasies, music, dancing, opium, wine."
Is it you and your partner who wants the kids out of your bed, or is it your favorite aunt (the same one who had your cousins crying-it-out at the age of four months in their own cribs in their own rooms) passing passive-aggressive judgment on you for your sleeping practices? Are you embarrassed or inconvenienced about breastfeeding your toddler in public, or is it that your sister is rolling her eyes and starting the same (judgmental) conversation again when you need to take five on a mall bench to feed your two-year-old? It’s questions just like these that Bialik challenged us parents to honestly answer for ourselves and our kids so we can parent the best way possible – and judgment-free – in the sling and beyond.
While I am not sure this is the "correct" use for the bench, that is the story we were given at the Edmondston-Alston House.

Use this week as a chance to get rid of stress, and to identify those areas of your life where you are holding on to anxiety. The most crucial element of this week is to find a time to spend in prayer for significant portions of the day. As we learn to relinquish control and let God be in charge, we will no longer let our lives be ruled by stress.
I'm going to need to replace those fall and Halloween quilts in the family room and still do not have a Christmas quilt, so I'm going to knock out a flannel rag quilt for the hubs. I was going to make a quilt for a gift, but I'm no longer feeling the love for this idea, so this will likely not happen. So many quilts, so little time. Sigh.
The reason I am writing about this is that I feel very strongly that children should be exposed to things, not along a manufacturer’s guideline but by their own readiness. I know my child and I know that he will play imaginatively with the large buttons rather than attempt to hoover them. I know that he is always itching to use Mumma and Daddy’s pens when we write, so I allow him to draw with them, and he enjoys it much more than crayons. I know that letting him try out the glue stick, even if he gets himself all gluey and sticky in the process, is totally worth it for him to learn and have the experience.
Jamie's friends were staying at a house in front of back door. All those boys ever did was surf and watch the waves from their porch. Ty-pi-cal. Ask me again why I never wanted to marry a surfer... They were bigger divas than us girls. Anyway, we were bored and itching for an adventure so we took their kayak out. That didn't really work out for us. After many sloppy attempts, a friend was nice enough to paddle it through the waves so we could play in it past the break. It was one of my favorite things we did and we ended up swimming with a couple turtles.
I understand what it's like to try to reach someone, shout into their soul their worthiness and finding that the fortress inside is soundproof.
He raced down the shadowed street and stopped at the corner, heart pounding, looking both ways. North, over the hill: the road to St. Etienne. A train to Paris, like he’d said? There were no trains now. Or south—south to where? Oh Lord if I choose wrong I’ll never find him.
Without never again there is very little leverage to change. If there isn't leverage, then you haven't convinced yourself of its necessity. If change isn't a necessity, then it's okay to go on with the way you're living, which may be fine. But if there is something you really want to change, it is imperative to get to the point where you declare: never again!
Good morning everyone. Yesterday afternoon I had a little to-do but let's not go there. I'm going to consider it an inconvenience, at most. Let's get on with our weekend doings because they are much more fun.
Identifiable both by its distinctive seedhead and its leaves, which are folded at the base, Orchardgrass is an increasingly-popular species both for pasture, silage, and hay. In addition to its self-propogation properties, Orchardgrass is a robust producer in the vegetative state, outperforming Kentucky Bluegrass and Timothy while being more palatable to livestock than other high producers like Reeds Canarygrass. Orchardgrass also is tolerant to close grazing, and as long as the base and tillers are left behind, regrows vigorously after close cutting or chomping that would kill Timothy.
I had hoped that after all my testing was over and I finally had my answer that I would have some kind of peace. It turns out that whatever relief I got from the resolution of the medical situation was replaced with other stresses, so it was all a wash.

Also women like making a mountain out of a molehill. Sharing your love problems with another woman only makes it worse, because when two women come together, their brains combine to make a master plan which is directed towards making a man pay for the actions he did but is truly not aware of. This normally leads to devastation, followed by a cat fight and end of friendship between the two women.

Prison is big business.
Okay, back from my hiatus here. I'd like to say I've been away on a secret mission for my country, but the truth is this is the first time in about a week that I've felt good. I have had the WORST headache/ stabby pain right behind my right eye and temple. Relentless headache. I've been pretty much living on a regimen of Excedrin, Ibuprofin, and Aleve. I thought it might have been eyestrain, but that usually comes on late afternoon. Then I thought maybe it was blood pressure, but it was weird that it was just on one side. Maybe abscessed tooth? Except I didn't have a toothache. Sinus infection? Syphilis? The wrath of God?

I have fast become an expert in all things Jude, and what I don’t know, I make up/learn along the way. Take yesterday for example. After a few errands, we made our last stop at the grocery store. Instead of pushing him in his stroller–which has limited space for our purchases–I decided to put him in the front of the shopping cart. At the last minute, while unbuckling him from his car seat, I opted to leave his pacifier behind because I think it inhibits his babbling, and I’d like to slowly wean him from the habit.
That is amazing to me.
There aren’t really words to describe how special the Canahuati family is. In the face of such pain they put their grief aside to provide everything they could for their little girl. I honestly don’t know if, when faced with such a painful situation, I wouldn’t just spend all day in bed crying. Her parents are two very, very strong people that pushed everything to the side when their daughter needed them. They were destined to be a family, because Avery needed two people as remarkable as her two parents to keep smiling.
Chand’s charming story is accompanied by equally cute drawings by Sarah Shaw. The pictures remind me of the styles used in comic books, which I think is quite appropriate given the premise that Honey is a superhero. Honey gives little ones the feel of comic book “save the day” heroes, minus the “bam”, “pow”, and “crack” of comics for older kids and adults.
Our friends K and C got married over the weekend - Congratulations you two lovebirds!!! C knows that I love to bake, and she thought cake pops would be cute to have at the reception. So a couple months before the wedding, I started baking and testing and practicing making Bakerella's famous cupcake pops.
Mitt believes that women must have access to healthcare, unless they live outside of Massachusetts.
So, much of the anti-immigration and proposition nation rhetoric of Jewish organizations depends overtly or covertly on the identification of Jews as victims of historical persecutions. Much of the moral authority of these groups would be lost, in my estimation, if Jewish involvement in spreading the pernicious ideology of communism were better known.

Lauren only represent Young Adult, Middle Grade, and Adult Romance authors. She's looking for YA(any genre), MG(any genre),Contemporary Romances, Historical Romances, and anything edgy and dark. She doesn't want or need anymore Paranormal/Romances.(Unless you have horror as a sub-genre and in that case she'll make an exception.) She would like to see some YA or MG horror novels cross my desk. The creepier, the better. She's also looking for edgy contemporaries and swoon-worthy romances. If you've written a New Adult novel ( in any of the genres listed above), she will consider that as well.
We had to run for dinner. Jon walked down to Van Ness with us, and waited till we managed to catch a cab; great to see you, Jon! Dinner was at The House of Prime Rib, and man, was it ever. Check out that link, and you'll kind of get the idea. All they serve is prime rib (well...okay, if you insist, they also have grilled fish), which Amy happily models for you on the left. You have a choice of four cuts, mashed or baked (my baked spud was incredible), creamed spinach or creamed corn. Dinners come with salad and Yorkshire pudding. That's it. Oh, and bread and cornbread. Cocktails? How about a Sazerac? I can't get that for you, sir, only because we have no Herb-Saint. So I ordered an Old-Fashioned and our waiter asked if I wanted bourbon or rye; rye? Which one, sir? Wow. Good drink, too.
Biblical proverbs are excellent. ‘It is good to give, than receive.’ The words of Jesus Christ are the best way to teach the child to share at the evening meal table or when friends come over to play. A child loves to receive and we too, try hard to give the best to our children. The next time, the child has a chocolate bar, make it a point to teach the child to share a piece with its older sibling or a friend. Little thoughts have deep values. ‘The early bird catches the worm’, this proverb has much meaning in the later phases of life. Habits of getting up early in morning, timeliness in watching cartoon or doing the homework is about discipline. A child who has value for time is stress free, as being organized becomes his second nature.

Apologies for being enigmatic but as the participants in today's meeting with Nick Gibb felt that they would prefer it if today's meeting remained confidential, I have to respect that.
The problem is that the film feels like it’s in denouement when it really isn’t. That’s tantamount to a spoiler, but did you really expect anything different? What they should have done, probably, is shaved off some time from the first phase of the story and added more bridges in the second phase so that the third phase could lumber under the montages and vignettes. All three phases needed to be there for this to be the movie they wanted, but the balance was a little off.

I've been making these blocks again today so I can get enough to make another quilt. I've been working on some which are all in various shades of blue as well as another set of prints which would be suitable for a boy. The reason for focusing on these blocks is to match some which have been donated. I don't usually make a quilt in just one or two colours but I have some blue blocks and I want to match them.
There’s also the jinxing factor. By not reserving a tent you could be jinxing yourself.
I recently discovered an amazing new line from Japan called il by Saori Komatsu. I completely fell in love when I saw the Fall 2012 collection as it is styled so fresh and the quality is amazing. I have always been a huge fan of Japanese fashion and this collection is a great example of how the Japanese aesthetic can translate in the US. I seriously want every piece in the collection and am completely obsessed. Il by Saori Komatsu is a knitwear based line that uses a very special method called “WHOLEGARMENT” that uses a single thread to make the whole garment. AMAZING!

My idea of love is much different from most. Sometimes it hurts. It hurts because when I love someone, I truly do set them free, no matter how much it might hurt me to do so. I feel very strongly that someone I love should be truly happy… even if that is not with me. As much as I would love to spend every waking moment with you, I will settle for what I get because I love you and have set you free. ”

In my facination with the idea of books as symbols I recently discovered the sculpture of Jacqueline Rush Lee. Jacqueline is drawn to the symbolic qualities of used books, their histories and how they serve as vehicles of expression. Over the last 10 years she has been transforming books into sculptures, scrambling their formal arrangements, transposing their materials and creating new conceptual and evocative art forms.
On a craftier note, I have started construction on a crocheted tank top. It’s dark blue, with dark blue stripes. Ok, you kinda need to see it. I’ll post pictures soon, when it looks like more than a rectangular blob. But to get there, I seriously need some sleep. Zzzzzzzzzzzz…
1. Use Goodreads—I had an account on this page for a long time before I really put it to good use. Now, I can’t imagine how I ever kept track of my reading habits without it. If you’re like me, you skim a book in the store but don’t have the money to buy it, so you put it down and promptly forget the author and/or title. With Goodreads, you can put it on your “to read” list (which can be sub-categorized into lists you design). Download the free app, and you can add books instantly using information or by scanning bar codes with your smart phone. When the time comes for a new list or selecting a new read, you’ve got plenty to choose from. There’s also a reading challenge you can enter and a bevy of widgets to use on your blog!
I'm starting to add in once a week projects too. I'm on day 11, and so far this is fun, and I'm wondering how many plates I'm going to get spinning. I have plans to add editing, writing, submitting stories, exercise, art, and other things to the mix. Anybody want to play?
We all know that LaMichael can handle his fair share of running the football, but with a stacked running back staff, what will be his role with this team? In order to get minutes on offense, he is going to have to show that he can catch the ball out of the backfield. This is something that he didn’t do too much of in college. This wasn’t because he couldn’t, it was that he didn’t need to. He was a very efficient rusher and the Ducks playbook didn’t call for too many screen passes.
Intrinsic Aging of Skin
For just a few dollars more through Amazon than for an entry level headset, if you are looking for a headset for daily wear while on the move, the Jabra is an excellent value for your money. If you wear a headset while sitting at a desk, where it is relatively quiet and want the best comfort and best conversation quality, I recommend the Plantronics Voyager 520 for ablut $20 less.

Thematically, it’s a well-crafted film, and you’ll discover intelligent inspirations from folklore, occult and myths: A young girl is wandering alone in an enchanted forest, loses her way in a labyrinth and enters another world that she finds hard to escape — once you join these dots, you’ll have a basic outline of Lewis Caroll’s Alice in Wonderland. This is a murkier and sinister version with Pan as the epicenter of havoc, and a legend to hold it all together. Pan is the Greek god of wild, shepherds and flocks, nature, hunting and rustic music. He is recognised as the god of fields, groves, and wooded glens; because of this, Pan is connected to fertility and the season of spring. As the girl’s mother is undergoing difficult pregnancy, the choice of Pan as the garbed enemy is perfect. Rather, taking a Greek god and making him a demon is a brilliant antithesis.

The divorce is very complicated and of course I cannot discuss it in public – yet… I have no idea what my financial status is going to look like and won’t know for another few months. The best I can do is move forward with my life and keep paying down the marital debt and adding to the marital assets. At some point it will all work out.
Note: Now I had originally thought I would have to keep out the specifically "wedding" gift bags(I had soooo many), tissue and ribbon, but I ended up having plenty of space for those in this box, all the bags are together, same with the tissue and ribbon though, so that I can find them easily, and if need be, move them to a smaller, seperate bin later on.

This weeks episode of Kimi To Boku revolves around Akira, an unknown character. He’s Koichi’s friend from high school, who is short, looks young, and is immature like Tachibana. He doesn’t really have much common sense, and he’s kind of oblivious towards his surroundings. Though, if this episode was going to focus on Akira, they should of given us a little bit more of a background than they did. I kept wondering if he was a teacher, or some karate teacher because he flipped someone onto the ground, which was pretty awesome.
It broke my heart but spoke to me as well. There is a lesson here I need to take to heart, and a lesson for all of us as well. Remember that scripture I used a few paragraphs up? The one where Jesus says “I was hungry, and you did not feed me, naked and you did not give me clothes”? This little dog represents all those people out here in our lives, who do not know God. Just as that little dog was lost and in danger of losing its life, so are so many around us. I knew that without help that dog was doomed, but I hardened my heart and did nothing about it. Now it is too late to do anything. The dog is dead. Done. Gone.

The younger man who had been so impatient with her needed to hear my pastor talk about the time our church went caroling at the old folks’ home about a year and a half ago. He needed to hear the stories of the elderly people whose lives had been enriched by hearing songs sung to them by people who had never met them before. He needed to hear that elderly people are a treasure and not an inconvenience.
Discovered Authors and their parent BookForce UK have had their ups and downs over the past two years, nevertheless, they have persevered. Companies House list one incarnation as being dissolved on 28/7/2009 and BookForce Distribution Ltd being incorporated on 31/7/2009. The Bookseller (see below links) has also covered their troubles over the past two years with two features, and it would be foolish if I did not disclose that the UK Society of Authors has received a series of complaints about BookForce.

I disagree strongly with Mr. Gingrich’s splash-play on judges – but I hasten to add, his ideas are not “crazy.” The Supreme Court’s final authority on constitutional interpretation was an unsettled and controversial question before 1803, when Chief Justice John Marshall handed down the landmark Marbury v. Madison decision. And the controversy continued simmering thereafter (emphasis on “simmering,” as we conducted judicial and political business as if the issue were finally settled).
The thing is, we all need to eat. It's really helpful to have a roof over our heads, too. Why not make those things as pleasant as possible? Why not use the tiny bits of power we have as wisely as possible? Tomatoes and peppers figure strongly in my container garden. I once grimly joked that "come the Apocalypse, I can keep us in salsa." But when I make bowls of salsa in the summer, I feel so accomplished. I may have given some multi-national corporation my hard-earned money for the chips, but the dip, oh, that's mine. I control the nutrition profile, seasonings, and cost of our dinners. I may drink Pepsi, but I try to patronize local farmers and companies. I will be taking a canning class this spring, so we can enjoy strawberry jam and tomato sauce made entirely with my own hands next winter. (Just typing that makes me smile.)
The Millionaire Falls Hard takes place mostly in Scotland, but does stop off in London and Miami for short periods. Carrie is a children’s author and divorced single mother who was in an abused relationship. Her mother Suzanne was originally from Scotland and had had a brief affair with her employer, resulting in Carrie. Suzanne fled when she learned she was pregnant. Later, she and Carrie fled to the United States when her husband turned out to be a lech. Carrie fell in with the wrong group and married a man her mother didn’t like. He abused her and the last time they were together, he raped her leaving her pregnant with Charlie. Carrie learned of her biological father and he had left her a small portion of his estate in Scotland. By this time, she was a successful author and moved to Scotland, building a home on her inherited land. Other than her mother, the only other person who knew of her parentage was her father’s son. He ran the rest of the estate into bankruptcy and sold it to Jake. Jake’s father had been the groundskeeper on the estate when he was a child. They left when Jake’s mother died. Jake learned quickly to take care of himself and built a successful corporation from the ground up. He relocated his company from London to Scotland and his path crossed Carrie’s several times. He wasn’t impressed with her parenting skills or behavior, but he wasn’t aware of the stalker or the threats that continued to be made against her. He was jealous when other men were with her, even though he had no idea of her relationship with them. The threats continued and he found himself becoming very protective of Carrie and her son. About half way through the story, the stalker opened fire on her house, riddling it with bullets. The police caught him…her half-brother…and she essentially shut down for several days. Jake cared for her and then they went about their lives. They both ended up in the States for unrelated reasons. Jake was in the process of buying a business in Miami which turned out to be owned by Suzanne’s boyfriend. Carrie was there working on a movie deal for one of her books and was visiting her mother. Jake and Carrie’s paths crossed again and this time for several days. At the end of their time in Miami, they both had strong feelings for the other, but went on to their respective tasks. Jake did not contact Carrie for eight weeks and she was more than pissed at him, especially since she had turned up pregnant. Jake didn’t mean to ignore her, but was busy simplifying his business because he intended on starting a family with Carrie. They got things squared away, got married and Carrie gave birth to twin boys a few months later.
SMaSH stands for Single Malt and Single Hop. Most beer is made using a variety of malts and hops and commercial brewers rarely use this approach. Home brewers have popularized SMaSH beers as a way to experience the full flavor of each ingredient. This recipe uses 10 pounds of Maris Otter malt and 6 ounces of Simcoe hops.

So, we now know that ME is caused by a virus, with an incubation time of about 1 to 3 weeks. It's also a stealth virus, in the way that routine testing by your doctor won't find anything.

Her remarkable parents decided to create a “bucket list” for their precious baby. Instead of crying and cursing God, they decided to give Avery a life as whole as possible.

The most recent blog post announces the death of their precious baby.
He had to serve in leadership positions within the troop for 6 months, and finally had to have a board of review with three members of the Boy Scout Council. It was not easy. He's a very shy young man, and he has a bit of anxiety. It's a challenge for him to make phone calls because he gets flustered when he doesn't feel like he knows the answers to questions. (Usually he doesn't think to listen to the question...he blurts out "I don't know" before he figures out he might know the answer). He had so much anxiety about having to call the person in charge of advancements to schedule his board of review he told me he wasn't going to finish. All he had to do was have the interview. I hounded him, we argued, and for 5 months we went back and forth with it. Even the day of his board of review, he wanted to go back home and just forget it. He was very nervous, but he went in there and did his best. We were not in there with him, one of his leaders went in with him to introduce him, and then he came out and waited with us. Keoni came out an Eagle Scout. We are very proud of him. His court of honor was a week ago, and I was very touched by a story told by that very leader.

In both cases, these smaller types of busses serve generally short routes, connecting (for example) a transit center or marketplace (these things generally come together) with a housing estate (a common term for a large apartment building or other residential complex) or a small village communtity, both of which are abundant in the rural parts of the region. The service that they often run is shuttle-like in nature, in that there are two distinct clusters of stops (often a single stop) on either end of the route, without much in between. The primary franchised bus lines generally serve provide bidirectional service along a linear corridor, just like the vast majority of the bus lines in Portland do.

Slowly, his brain erected a semblance of first-realm logic between him and the world. Up was the direction his head was pointing. That meant that the big green thing in front of him was a plain. Other features resolved themselves into the sky, trees, the far-distant towers of the Court. Rel allowed himself to relax when he managed to pin down the red flower that grew out of the sky about half-way across the plain.

Admittedly, I am very overwhelmed and under qualified to shake a stick at this discussion and properly encourage any of you. Travis and I very excited to be going to Together for Adoption Boot Camp with a handful of other friends we've persuaded to attend with us in a few months to deepen our knowledge of this essential part of the Gospel.

I always get a good chuckle when people tell me not to forget pictures when something big or semi-big is going to be happening. I chuckle because I take my camera almost everywhere with me.

I've found out that I kind of miss blogging. I've thought a lot about it, and I've gotten some feedback from some people that has been important to me. I've decided that I'll keep writing....at my own pace. I stand by what I said in my last post about not wanting autism to take up so much of my life. By it's nature it takes a lot of my time and energy, but I don't have to give it everything. If I do that I'll miss so much that makes life worthwhile. I've really scaled back on the time I put into reading blogs and articles about autism, and that has helped a lot. I'm not big on conflict, so that's been a good decision for me.

Taslin pulled Dora up into her lap, the spectacle made eerie as the Four Knot seemed to float there, limp and half-out of her blanket, head lolling to one side. Dora didn't make even so much as a mumble, and when her head turned to face the stars, it was clearly because of Taslin's tight grip. Rel took the canteen from his pack and wetted a corner of his blanket. He couldn't resist a grin.

Thank you so much to everyone for the kind words of support, the helpful advice, and for just reading this past month.

Going into meditation to see who shows up is always fascinating for me. Even though I have been doing this for years it still surprises me when someone shows up without any conscious thought about who it might be. Today, it was a Polar Bear. She told me her name is Shatung. For those of us who are highly sensitive we sense and feel the emotions of others. Fortunately, this extraordinary sensitivity is also the gift of being highly intuitive. Even though I felt her deep sadness I was also able to hear her message. That is the blessing…and fortunately there are always ways to close the door on the energy that comes at us continually and open up to it when it serves us. We do have control.

The Finals will take place at the Royal Cinema (608 College St. in Little Italy). The slammers competing for a spot on the 2012 TPS Team are The P.O.E., Cathy Petch, Britta B, David Delisca, Tanya Neumeyer, Eytan Crouton, Spencer Butt and Noah Kaplan.

Admission at the door is $20.
For my money, I’d say there’s more chemistry and energy on display in this performance than could generally be found at shows in the band’s early days. So, while there’s certainly a risk that Stapleton and Henderson’s departures will cause The SteelDrivers to sputter out, there’s also a chance that the upheaval will permit the group to evolve into a more vital performing unit. While we await their fate, I’ll be serving up some more tasty samples of their work in the near future. Stay tuned.
April 2012 Glymm Box: meh. I’m eager to try the lip gloss, but that’s about it. The bar soap smells nice but bar soaps have never done me any good, so I’m indifferent about trying this one out. The shampoo sounds great but the sample packet is a pathetic size – I’d rather have gotten one large shampoo sample than two shampoo & conditioner samples – I don’t have any expectations here. I don’t wear perfume, and this sample is smaller than something I’d get for free from Sephora – this sample I’m actually displeased with. I’ll let you know about the NuMe gift certificate when I have a chance to check out their website and products.
If you’ve a phobia of adorable characters, you should steer away from this show, as Menma is just too cute and such a crybaby most of the time. The annoyance of a character like her can be intolerable, but I can say that it isn’t that bad in the latter half of the series, where the focus shifts away from Jintan and Menma and more to the other characters.

I think, perhaps, this was one section of the book that felt a little bit under to me because everything seems to come to Maeve too easily. Previously insurmountable challenges are resolved with solutions that border on deux ex machina. The themes which flow throughout the book, while well defined and explored can also feel a little heavy handed at times, a little too obvious to older reader such as myself.

Hello bloggy friends.
a seed or two of scattered potential,
So what they broadcast wasn't my story. It was something else.
We love pesto in our house, and it's one of those things where once you make a batch of it there are tons of things you can do with it. Basil is really best in summer, so in the winter time fresh kale makes delicious pesto. It might sound strange, but it really does work, maybe even better than the basil variety, at least in my opinion. It's made almost the same as basil pesto, just substitute kale for basil and instead of pine nuts I use walnuts. Don't skip on toasting the walnuts, it really does help bring out their nutty flavor. Since Meyer Lemons are in season here in California I use them instead of regular lemons too. Lastly, I add a big spoonful of Greek yogurt at the end. I know it seems like I put Greek yogurt in everything, but it does seem to be a magic ingredient. It's incredibly healthy and can be substituted for all kinds of dairy items. And don't think I am crazy for adding Greek Yogurt to this pesto. I swear it's what puts it over the top. It gives it this creaminess that is simply delicious. Honestly, I would rather have this pesto than the traditional basil pesto any day.

It's no secret that I'm not averse to divey bars or sketchily run places and kind of get a certain kick out of them. But, I AM averse to paying cocktail prices way beyond what the experience merits. While the sneaky smoking area might pull in a certain clientele, the cocktails here will not. I can see it drawing a crowd of ironic hipster wanna-be's and patrons who are impressed enough by a change of pace from the common Parisian bar decor to be fooled into thinking it's something more than it is. But, for me, I'd rather have the Zov Ilicha in Russia. At least they had naughty pictures on the wall for entertainment!

That was all. We purchased tickets to the bus, some souvenirs (V got his favorite – a Denali baseball cap), a bit of food, and settled to the camp. There was some sort of dinner made mostly from the old uneaten backpacking dinners and newly purchased stuff. After that, since it was still light and good weather, a small group did a hike around the Denali Village towards a small beaver lake. One can see the Alaska railroad and the resorts inside the park. Good thing that it is all localized to the small area right at the entrance and the rest of the park is still wilderness without even trails. Towards the evening it started raining again while I tried unsuccessfully to fall asleep.

The surprises in the novel for me were technological. As I followed the main character, John Matherson, through his traumatized community, I gradually discovered more and more things (beyond the obvious) that had been affected--things that I would never have imagined to be vulnerable or that I would never have even thought about. I will give you one example: commercial airliners. Surely, these would keep on flying since they run on liquid fuels, not electricity. Alas, the complex electronics in modern airliners freeze up after an EMP strike. And, that means that the thousands of them in the sky at the time would plummet to the ground or into the sea. There are no mechanical joysticks in such aircraft; everything is controlled by computers and electronics. As the story continues, the list of vulnerable gadgets and systems just keeps growing, and it is an awesome and disturbing one.

I believe we can do more and make our financial resource go further by reprioritizing what we do. This will create a more compelling motivation for stewardship and cooperative support. But there won’t be a significant difference without a spiritual renewal that brings about massive grassroots involvement in witness and missions, churches reproducing and starting churches and a paradigm shift from paying someone else to do it for us. Stay with me as we explore these issues.
Still more bad news: Greta Garbo was on a European vacation, and reports of her embarrassing behavior there had reached the States.

The Countess, like Garbo, preferred boots and trousers, and was known in Sweden as a lesbian.

What does James mean by enduring trials? The Greek word is hupomeno, which means to remain, i.e. abide, not recede or flee; to preserve: under misfortunes and trials to hold fast to one’s faith in Christ. When you don’t shrink back from a trial, when you instead walk through it with your faith firmly in Christ, you demonstrate your love for the Lord and you receive the crown of life, one of five crowns (Gr., stephanos) named in Scripture. The crown of life is mentioned twice in the New Testament – here, and in Revelation 2:10:

What gave me strength as Deacon’s father, mother, and sister worked through the sort of loss that no words can adequately describe, was that they remained real. They were honest, they were raw, they were hurt. They didn’t try to cover up pain with something false. They didn’t shy away from their need for people and support. Deacon’s father (one of the pastors at the church-plant where I serve) let himself be vulnerable to our community, and shared openly about how his relationship to and with the church was a pillar of support for him and his family. There were good days, bad days, unbearable days…but through it all, their aim was never to overcome or ignore the massive hurt and loss, but to battle through and lean on others even as they were leaned on by others. To use Christ as the compass, people as the oars, and press onward through the sea of troubles so accurately titled by Shakespeare centuries ago.

Alternatively, under a traditional CVA, the new owner can be in control by the start of next season. Both options depend on the matters mentioned above, and neither looks to be putting up the money needed to give a CVA any chance. So whilst in theory a CVA could result in a new owner being in charge by next season, I do not see how it can be achieved.

Honor the cannabis plant; ask to feel it’s higher dimensional energies in meditation rather than burning it’s structure to feel such energies that are themselves denser because of the act of burning the plant and in many cases, because the condition the plant was given in. Honor this plant and feel it’s energies by asking for such energies, rather than by destroying its structure without permission as indeed, one can ask for respectful permission to do so but the feeling of the energies of this and so many other plants while in meditation will see you better able to absorb the energies of these various plants which were first meant to help the lower dimensional humanity find and attain higher and purer states of consciousness and perception.

It is difficult for me to believe that Mitt will be the rights puppet as first and foremost he is representing the Mormon Church. It is history that tells us that once Grover Norquist seals the deal by guaranteeing the votes, then his candidate of choice has no ability to go back on the deal made. With Mitt’s soul already spoken for by the Mormon Church the negotiations will take time as we have seen already with the delay of the Santorum endorsement. Anyone who believes it is just because they don’t like each other after a dirty primary run, is either naive or misleading themselves or the American public. Mitt, personally, does lean more moderate, but he is being reinvented as I write this. We will know if and when he does agree to the pressure of ,Grover Norquist, as when he does he will gain the full support and endorsement of Rick Santorum and his constituency.

Faith is such a personal experience, so I never know how much is appropriate or inappropriate to share, how it will affect me or the relationships I share with others. What I do know is that there is an inexplicable beauty in all this - an overwhelming sense of gratitude and joy that has brought me to tears multiple times in recent days.
The trijet airliner was originally delivered to Singapore Airlines as 9V-SGB on September 26, 1977. The airframe would migrate to VASP (PP-SMK) on June 17, 1980. Alaska Airlines acquired the jetliner on March 8, 1982. It would become N293AS with Alaska in March 1986.

I keep thinking that if I figure out how to connect the dots, I will eventually have a complete story but doing so “strikes me as an exercise in futility” much like Levine describes living “in Cleveland” or “saving your pennies to buy a Rolls Royce.”
Values are not a subject that a teacher can cover in a classroom in a 50 minute period. A student enters school with a set of values already acquired, from the society and most importantly home. Some students will share in values because of similarities in up-brining, culture, and background. Not all students will have similar values and it will be in the classroom that often the students will have an opportunity to share and discover values that others have.
I spent this entire week longing for the one hour I had scheduled with the counselor that I'd seen just the one time. As I settled into her couch, she asked how things had gone since GF and I were there 2 weeks ago. I burst into tears and was unable to stop crying.

This coalition of the insulted and injured toppled Akayev from his eminence, and ushered in the recent Time of Troubles where crowds of men in piss-stained brown flares struggled to find the keys to the presidential drinks cabinet.
I have no real support at home my husband and my kids just roll their eyes and say OH NO..Not AGAIN. I don’t really have any contact with my family and i have very few friends and I can’t admit to anyone how bad the problem really is…
This is my buddy, Keisa - and I LOVE this girl. Now a senior in high school, she's been around YL for a couple of years now, but now our friendship is at the place of mutuality. She's eager to love and to learn and be challenged, and she rises to the occasion every time (which makes me ask...do I do the same? Am I eager to love? Am I open to learning and being challenged? I love that about her, and desire to do and be the same in my own life). Anyhoo, this particular day, she and I had a date to hang out:
So happy ending all around.
I submitted my blog article that I wrote about porn as a sort of “Let’s see what happens” kind of thing and awaited the outcome. I did consider posting on here asking for votes, but a part of me wanted to see if the writing would stand up on its own (or at least stagger around half cut like a Glaswegian drunk), so I left it be and waited.

Tomato Problems
1. You could write about a typical evening at home: on the surface, this is not particularly exciting and can be accomplished in one sentence: “Got home, at dinner, did homework, went to bed.” Ideally, your essay should provoke a response. In this light, you can allude to various rituals which occur each night in the family home, including animal sacrifice, devil worship and over-consumption of caffienated soft drink. In truth, the latter practice is likely to draw a more vigorous reponse from authorities.
Why flashed it not on me That one true heart was left behind! What feeling do we ever find To equal among human kind A dog's fidelity!" "Mistress, I dug upon your grave To bury a bone, in case I should be hungry near this spot When passing on my daily trot. I am sorry, but I quite forgot It was your resting place." -- Thomas Hardy
6. Get caught up with pictures…and I don’t just mean on the blog/Facebook…but in my house! Like I seriously need to update frames, etc…the pictures in our house need a MAJOR renovation. Not to mention I need to update the kids baby/birthday books and make sure those are current. Lots to do in 2012!!! =O
It compares with some of the best belgian ales at less than $10 for a sixer! I have to wonder why a person would take the time to be a member of Beer Advocate then trash a well brewed beer just because it doesn't conform exactly to their perceived concept of how a beer should taste. Seems narrow minded and contrary to the spirit of being, you know, an advocate for beer.
Tom's submission was brewed by the Worthog Brewing Club and was called Molstoberfest (the beer on the right). It pours a dark unfiltered copper color with an 1.5 inch thick head. It has a nice smell, including sweet caramel and crusty bread aromas with the slightest touch of citrus hops. This beer is medium bodied with an immediate malt sweetness with the first sip. It really is super smooth and drinkable and has a great refreshing carbonation. This is a very good session beer, you could drink quite a few of them...something Tom is known to do from time to time. I am going to guess it is about 6% abv. While the malt profile has the right sweetness, the use of extracts makes it just a touch thin at finish. This is a really nice Octoberfest...I am impressed so far. I give this a solid 3.6.
Extra-curriculars should be done out of pure curiosity and intellectual stimulation or for fitness or for fun. They should not be done against one's will in order for transcript padding to try to appeal to college admissions officers. I pray that admissions officers can sniff out the phonies from the authentic kids.
I have heard numerous stories on my visits to these islands. One of them is particularly heart rendering. It is a tradition in these jungles that when the men go for honey collecting, their wives in the villages discard all the signs of marriage and don widowhood. They stop putting sindoor on their foreheads and take off the red and white bangles from their wrists. They even wear white clothes during that time, until their husbands come back safely. One has to understand that it is an astounding thing, because married Hindu women never stay without the signs of marriage, for doing so is believed to bring ill luck to their husbands.But such uncertain is the lives of the men that their wives do this as a penance so that they can have their men safely back home. It is a custom tinged with the dark colors of pathos.

Now to explain my answer above: Even if I decided there was some concept my children absolutely needed to know, there would be no guarantee I could make them learn it. Not by sending them to school. Not by teaching them at home. So I won't think of it that way. What I will do is give my children access to lots of different tools and experiences. I will support their interests, and they will learn what THEY need to learn. They will learn the things that are important to them. The things they will use in real life. Their own lists of "right things," not written by anyone else.
As I look at my past, present and what could possibly be my future, I have made a right choice, for once in my life, to obey God. And, though it’s hard, and there have been times when I just wanted to keel over in my bed…I get up, put on my big boy pants and face each day with my head held high. Folks, we are joint heirs with Christ! Let’s act like it! We’re royalty in the Kingdom of Heaven, so let us go about, throwing our fists in the air and join in the battle to bring down the gates of hell. Let’s bring an end to injustice. Let’s bring a message of love and peace to the widows and orphans. Let’s be disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ!
Raccoons. There were somewhere in the neighborhood of five to seven large raccoons at our picnic site, fighting over the marshmallows and chocolate. And I will say, raccoons are cute, but they are pretty much known for carrying rabies, so I really was not feeling all that reassured. The primary relief I felt was in knowing that I could probably frighten them off pretty easily. I shined my flashlight and encouraged them to leave, and, with the exception of a couple of really aggressive ones, they scrambled away. The last two I had to actually approach and shoo away, but finally, they left as well.
Rise and leave your home, don’t sit idly by.
A few weeks ago I made a large batch of some red lentil soup. Lots of goodness and lots of color. But as I ate a few spoonfuls I started having my usual (and horribly familiar) gluten-contamination reactions. Lots of tingling in my neck, numbness in my arms and legs and a weird foggy feeling in my head. My eyes start to itch in the corners of my eyes and after a few hours I have a very bloated and sick tummy. To say I was disappointed and flabbergasted was an understatement. I do so much to make sure my family and my food is gluten-free in my house and to be contaminated or poisoned in my own kitchen just makes me feel awful (and sick in more than one way!).
"My Way" by Frank Sinatra
Mike “Mikey” Riedel scribes over at Utah Beer and he’s on the cutting edge of what goes on beer-wise in the Beehive State. (Actually, it was through his blog that I became aware of the book Beer in the Beehive, which I later managed to track down at Red Rock Brewing in Salt Lake City.) Frankly, I don’t know how he manages to keep up with all the news up there but it’s pretty clear he has really good connections or contacts in the world of brewing, especially in the greater Salt Lake City area. If numbers in the current poll continue the way they are and I’m in need of guest columnists for Beer Rant, I’ll be barking up Mikey’s tree shortly after the New Year and when I finally follow through on forming a consortium of rocky mountain beer bloggers, I’ll be asking Mikey to sign on.

Grandma Rena's Pickled Beets
I've never been the most well prepared mom during my children's tenure. During play dates, while other mothers doled out Goldfish crackers and delicious cold juice boxes to their hungry offspring, I'd assure mine they just thought they were hungry, then encourage them to turn their Dickinsonian beggar faces away from the sight of that cheddar flavored cracker crack.
In Roman times, doctors recommended that patients chew mastic gum to freshen their breath and calm stomach upsets. People today chew it for the same reasons.
even though my tastes have changed over the last 8 years, i still really love this mirror...it just needed a quick update.

"it doesn't cost anything to go to the showroom" and I agree
There is a strong and unresolvable inconsistency between a concern about patent quality at the USPTO and opposition to limiting or abolishing continuing applications. People concerned about “patent quality” should want the USPTO to be able to obtain final decisions as to the patentability of applications it has examined. But the USPTO will continue to be unable to obtain such final decisions so long as applicants (or their attorneys) can avoid final decisions by refiling their applications. Thus the “patent quality” problem will persist so long as the USPTO remains unable to obtain final decisions as to the patentability of applications it has examined, and can rid itself of persistent applicants only by allowing their applications.
You never know when or from where knitting inspiration will come. Fast forward to December, 2011 and my bead-buying frenzy. Picture a tube of Miyuki 8/0 round seed beads in pink-lined crystal. “Oh, wouldn’t these beads look lovely worked into a nice, lacy scarf?” the knitter in me thought as I looked at the tube of beads. “And I have just the perfect yarn to go with these lovely pink beads.” Yes, the pink Kid Mohair had finally found its purpose in life.

We had fun anyway. The Race Directory kept announcing that they had "complementary bag check". I thought that meant that they would take your bag and tell you it looked nice. (a little funny). But these are airline people. For most of them bag check cost about $25.

I have never attacked anybody personally or made statements
I have evaluated the people that have been most “vocal” about what they think and how involved they seem to be and have used that involvement to determine that they are most likely willing help with that particular part of the reunion. In some cases, I have identified a need or issue that needs some attention and have reached out to get the right person (based on what I perceive or know about them) to take the lead on those key aspects. I think that we have the right people on the team, now it is my chance to see if we can make a reunion that those in attendance will remember, and those that didn’t attend wish that they had. So what are we planning? Well, stay tuned I am sure that there is a lot to be learned over the next few months. I am certain to share some of that with you.

Raise the heat to high, and add the rice, stirring well. Cook, stirring occasionally, for several minutes, until the rice is hot and beginning to brown.

I think one of the mistakes Im making with this dryer is taking too small a peice of hair when I run it through. When I watched reviews a few girls said it took 10-15 minutes from start to finish. Not for me it doesn't!! So I figured when I initially played with it that I must've been choosing too big a chunk of hair as it just seemed to take a while, and even after 20 minutes the inside of the twisted pieces of hair were still damp, so when I unraveled the twist some of the wave was lost because it wasn't fully dry.. So smaller sections should help, right? Wrong!
I don't have any particular angle on this as I gave up eating cereals many years ago and hadn't thought about it when I came here. I occasionally have muesli with milk in the evening, which some people in England considered a strange time.
In 1996 the first studiorecorded record was released - "Feels like Buzz Aldrin". It was recorded in mono at Jo-Allan's Recording Service in Hallstahammar, Västmanland, Sweden. "Feels like Buzz Aldrin" got great reviews; 8 out of 10 in POP Magazine, happy figures and 4 out of 5s and 6 in Dagens Nyheter, SvD, Nöjesguiden etc. It was raised all up to the skies by Per Bjurman at Aftonbladet and Mats Olsson at Expressen.
Internet we make our words available to billions, instantly, at no cost, while printed books may fail to find any audience. The academic book I worked hardest on has been read carefully by maybe a dozen people. I don't resent that -- I wrote it primarily in order to work out some ideas for myself -- but I wouldn't want to get particularly obsessed with publishing books. I'm more concerned with "privishing": maintaining a space of personal privacy in an age
Flowers: Globe de marriage (without the glass dome)
When I got home yet another good friend came to bid me farewell. An American expat like myself, our girls were born a few days apart and literally grew up together, going to the same day care, pre-school, kindergarden and elementary school. Needless to say they are best friends and over the years our families bonded. We went on to have two boys and spent many a vacation and week end together. Now she has left too, she lives in a different city and I am happy for her and her new life despite the loss.
Drooling yet? It's OK, you aren't alone....

Why is it then, that when we look at issues of infidelity, we, as women, are asked to not be upset with the whores who tried to steal our husbands and overturn our families. Time and time again, we read about, and are told “she owed you nothing”, or “he was the one with the contract with you, not her”, or “he broke his vows, she didn’t owe you anything”, and we are asked to excuse the mistress because she isn’t the one who broke the vow. Really? Is it just me that strikes a bad chord with? Am I simply too close to my own situation and filled with hatred and resentment that I am unable to see clearly what these other wise sages see?

America is the land of fat slobs, bar none. Sure, I’ve seen some major fashion faux pas here, but rarely would I think of the wearer as a slob, so much as just someone who failed at taking a fashion risk or just doesn’t really know what looks good on them. In America, people don’t even try.

an earlier time,
If this break-up/make-up doesn’t work for you, you have to start viewing Sunrise a different way. The special effects in the film’s first half, which added weight to a budding crime drama, now become the film’s baseline of normalcy. Really, you might be tempted to think Sunrise has gone off the rails, but everything about it is so well-made; you sort of hand your brain over to it. You give it the benefit of the doubt. You begin wondering if this City is real at all. It’s so impossibly bright, noisy, happy—like a candy shop, where everything’s expensive but nothing costs too much, and no one looks down on rural people for the way they dress, and where being rural actually comes in handy, like when a piglet runs amok in a dance hall and it takes a strapping farmer’s boy to snatch that piglet up, then entertain the adoring crowd with a peasant’s jig. The City is Party-Town, and only when the Couple leaves does it start to rain. You wonder if the past really happened. You become like the couple.
Part 1 of the problem was how to load the hindi font in the code and get the display to render it. If you try this on a phone without Hindi support - which is the vast majority of the phones out there, then all you see is squares instead of the text.

The sun was easing itself along its westerly course high above them as pillows of cumulus clouds made their lazy way southward. The fireflies had returned, dancing in and out of the sunbeams reflecting off the broken glass at their feet and all around the battered Camero. Marley found himself thinking about orcs and fairies again. He wished he was playing a game of D&D right now. The friends he normally played with had moved away last month and Roland was a little too dim to understand its intricacies and far too lazy to read the manuals.
