A prominent feature of the dining room is the blue-tiled wood-fired oven, so we wanted to see how it worked with the special appetizers. Melanzane ripiene ($8), eggplant rolled around mascarpone and ricotta, comes bubbling to the table. It's covered in mozzarella and a light tomato sauce packed with fresh herbs. The flavors work nicely, so it was a shame that the eggplant was ever-so-slightly undercooked.

A: It's not a rotation I can control, because I never know what opportunity is going to come up next. I mean, I guess the one that's easier for me to do is stand-up, because I've been doing it for so long at this point, I don't need to think about it that much. I can just go up and do it. Writing and acting takes more effort. But I like the work that goes into those things. I don't ever want to have to choose one.

Still, when Romney ran for Senate in 1994, he argued that he would be a better advocate for gay rights' issues than Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy because he would make gay issues mainstream.

Romney's fellow Latter-day Saints, moreover, can also make a positive difference at the ballot box. In the caucus states of Nevada and Idaho, large numbers of dedicated Mormon supporters allowed Romney to score huge wins. In Arizona, Latter-day Saints created a Romney rout. According to exit polls, 14% of Arizona Republican primary voters were Mormons, and virtually all of them voted for Romney. His built-in advantage apparently discouraged other candidates from seriously contesting Arizona and allowed the former Massachusetts governor to take all 29 Arizona delegates while focusing his own efforts on Michigan.
Kucinich strategically sprinkles his remarks to the largely black audience with quotes from Scriptures (Matthew 25:40) and Langston Hughes.

Four Patriots receivers topped the 50 reception mark this season — Wes Welker, Gronkowski, Hernandez and Deion Branch — but coordinator Bill O’Brien’s use of the twin tight ends has confounded defenses. The Patrtiots rarely line up without both players on the field, with Hernandez sometimes out wide or in the backfield and Gronkowski hugging the linemen.

Now some Democratic lawmakers actually want to make more trouble for struggling local governments trying to regain their financial footing. Assemblyman Bob Wieckowski, D-Fremont, has introduced a bill that would make it even more difficult for local governments to file for bankruptcy, which would allow them to seek compensation concessions from public employee unions. These governments already in some circumstances have to go through a "neutral evaluation" before a bankruptcy declaration. The new bill would give the mediator in the process even more ability to delay or thwart the plans of cities in terrible financial straits.
The statement continues: "The issue of releasing individual tax returns is far too often used as a distraction by those who do not have real solutions to the problems the voters care about.

Nicklaus used to smoke during golf tournaments, as many golfers did in that era, and a turning point in his behavior on the golf course came after that U.S. Open. It became such an important change that Nicklaus still remembers the day — Dec. 8, 1962 — when the USGA shipped him a film of his big win at Oakmont. He watched the key putts and booming drives, his straight left leg and upright posture. What unsettled him was a scene of him setting down a cigarette to tap in a putt during the playoff.

Planned Parenthood's presence also connects the race to the other Emily's List priority, support for abortion rights, and Schriock insists that Cornilles, backed by Oregon Right to Life, is out of step with Northwest Oregon voters. Cornilles has rejected the charge, declaring in a statement Thursday, "I'm pro-life with exceptions in the case of rape, incest and the life of the mother.

A new 2014 generation brings back its mission.
Then there was George H.W. Bush calling Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics -- giving tax cuts and breaks to the rich and conglomerates like GE -- "voodoo economics." That same trickle-down economics was revisited by George W. Bush when he gave two sizable tax cuts to the wealthy with the promise that jobs would follow. Fact is, more jobs were lost -- 700,000 a month in the run-up to the financial disaster in September 2008 -- under George W. Bush than at any other time since the Great Depression.

But the biggest worry is domestic demand here in the United States. Because most Americans' real pay continues to drop, they're going deeper into debt and tapping into their savings. Inevitably, they'll have to cut their spending. Without sufficient government spending to make up the difference, total demand will shrink, causing employers to pare hiring. March's disappointing jobs report could mark the beginning.
Expectations are high. About one-third of Rapha's sales come from the United States, but Mottram hopes to boost that to one-half. He's banking on Lance Armstrong mania and the environmental, pro-riding movement. And the Continental.

The luxury tax Dallas paid after last season will be more like $50 million when the stiffer tax kicks in for the 2013-14 season, so it's hard to blame the Mavericks for basically not even attempting a good-faith effort to repeat.

“There were people of all political persuasions outside the courthouse today saying, that’s enough," said Rita Beving, who helped organize the rally. “There are a lot of pipelines in Texas.

Ratcheting up the personality cult it builds around the Kim family, North Korea claimed that Kim Jong Il's death generated a series of spectacular natural phenomena, creating a mysterious glow atop a revered mountain, cracking a sheet of ice on a lake with a loud roar and inspiring a crane to circle a statue of the nation's founder before perching in a tree and drooping its head in sorrow.

About that story: Writen by Almodóvar and his brother, Agustín, based on a novel by Thierry Jonquet, it occasionally threatens to slip off the rails; sometimes a wheel or two does. But the messiness doesn't slow Almodóvar, a confident director if ever there was one. He revels in it. You might, too. Or you might be disgusted. But you won't be undecided.
Hurst and Buckner also witnessed the generosity of strangers.
Still, Romney has this going for him: He's not Obama. The president frightens Bower with his expansive health care overhaul, his rhetorical shots at the rich and the red ink that has gushed over the past three years.

First, Justin Martin, the author of Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted came to town. He wanted a tour of Roland Park, so his host called me. Fortunately, I had just that morning been working on tour of Plat 2, where the Olmsted firm was first involved. The facts were fresh in my mind, and a fellow Olmsted admirer was working with me. Together we toured Wyman Park, Roland Park and Guilford. That much of this community is still intact 115 years after the Olmsteds were first involved says a lot about the strength of their original design. It also says a lot about the vigilance with which the community has preserved the design, architecture, landscape and unique features like the footpaths and green islands.
“We didn’t play very well there for a while,” Broxton said, “so there weren’t too many chances to go out there — especially with a lead. It’s one of those things that every team goes through. We just took ours at the beginning of the season.

Prime Minister Menachem Begin ordered a daring Israeli airstrike on an unfinished Iraqi nuclear in 1981 just a few weeks before Israelis went to the polls. His Likud Party won that election.

A few weeks ago, I had lunch with a former high-ranking Blazers executive who worked under Allen. I asked him to draw the organization's flow chart, as if it were one of those cop shows with the crooks and bosses mapped out on the bulletin board. He first drew a clear diagram with Allen at the top and his lieutenants below, then, stopped and said, "Now, I'll tell you how it really works." He proceeded to map out a twisted and convoluted diagram that demonstrated a glaring flaw.
The second season of the Starz series "Spartacus" gets rolling at 10 p.m. Friday with a new Spartacus. Replacing a prime-time show's popular lead actor is a tough enough assignment, but Liam McIntyre realized that this particular challenge went beyond difficult, all the way to daunting.

USC, shooting below 40 percent on the season and in the nation’s bottom five in assists, went cold early. The Beavers took advantage of USC’s missed shots and turnovers in their early 13-0 run that gave them an 18-8 lead – one that never was seriously threatened.
Micah Camden started this postmodern sushi bar as though he'd read about the concept but was never tainted by examples. He sets out slabs of tuna, salmon and hamachi gilded with citrus bits and just a little bit of bite, or smoked salmon rolls with house-cured gravlax, or tempura scallop covered in shredded filo. Portions (and prices) are small, encouraging you to fill up the table with different bites and flavors -- set off by inventive cocktails such as bourbon with muddled ginger. Winters bring larger, meatier entrees, but summers open up the outdoor tables out back, for an evening of house-infused vodka and hamachi that feels like nowhere on Earth -- and not at all like Northeast Portland.
An Ohio soldier's 2003 death in a truck crash with a Kuwaiti contractor has inspired a coalition of Ohio lawmakers to introduce legislation that would establish U.S. court jurisdiction over federal contracts with both domestic and foreign companies.

All of the pricier specialty entrees are interesting and well-prepared. If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the chile-and-ale short ribs. The tender Angus beef is braised with morita chiles and served with caramelized sweet potatoes and a side of braised Swiss chard with spiced crema. Many of the dishes included a side of greens, a standout in a genre rife with a sea of orange rice and lifeless globs of refried beans.
On Friday hundreds of pilots and other employees marched into AMR headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, and in New York to deliver a message of "no confidence" in the company's management.

Everyone searches for that epiphany, that moment of clarity when all external forces, mystical and real, align.

With the explosion of artisanal spirits in California and all over the U.S., as well documented by my colleagues here at the L.A. Times, one would think we’d be drowning in organic bourbon, GMO-free this and heritage that. But … no.

View full sizeDania Maxwell / The OregonianThe groundbreaking for the Portland-Milwaukie Light Rail Bridge took place at the end of June.

The bottom line is that Oregon employed about 800 more nonfarm workers in June than seasonal patterns would anticipate.

When you get away with doing something wrong, you might do it again and again, and eventually create a nasty habit of mooching off others or letting someone else do the work while you accept the credit.

answering in the affirmative. For that, he was charged with universalism. But it wasn't that simple. The key word for von Balthasar was "hope." He said that he was not positing what was essentially a theological thought experiment as a formative doctrine. What he was saying was that it was appropriate for Christians to hope (and indeed even pray) that all people might be saved. Likewise, he didn't deny the existence of hell; he merely hoped (there's that word again) that at the end of the day hell might be empty. His critics were not convinced. But I wouldn't be surprised if Rob Bell's thinking on the subject is, consciously or unconsciously, influenced by von Balthasar.

What's saddest of all is that Toole didn't live to witness his novel's posthumous success. After years of persistence, his mother persuaded the respected Louisiana novelist Walker Percy to read the manuscript. Percy found a publisher for "A Confederacy of Dunces"; the novel became a bestseller, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1981 and has been rightly regarded as classic. And not just a classic but one of those "you've got read this" books passed from hand to hand. Toole was no poete maudit, living on the margins of society and filling notebooks with crabbed, avant garde jottings incomprehensible to his own era. His was a big, broad and, above all, accessible talent, and the story of Toole's protagonist, the obese, orotund, gaseous and unemployable amateur medieval scholar and scourge of the modern world Ignatius J. Reilly has never been out of print or out of favor since its publication.

Regarding Patricia Kilday Hart's column "Texas leaders with balanced approach need to step up" (Page B1, Wednesday), she is correct in stating our problem is so big that - regardless of political party - we must act together as Texans for our common good.

If only it were compatible with the Office 97 files that most of my Mac apps spit out. Docs I generate from Office itself carry over just fine; I can read, add notes, make changes, and save it back to SkyDrive. But it turns its nose up at the documents I export from the iPad edition of Pages.

He suggested that if Tribune Co. and its creditors can't see their way clear to a confirmable plan, he may be forced to appoint a bankruptcy trustee to resolve the case, even if it means taking months to get the trustee up to speed.
Good thing the edgy theater troupe Capital Stage moved from the Delta King to new midtown digs, because this 1998 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama by Vogel might have capsized the old paddlewheeler. This is a serious examination of some serious themes, most notably child sexual abuse but, strangely, not without funny moments. In other words, it doesn't come off like a melodramatic Lifetime Network TV movie. Vogel has said she conceived the play as " 'Lolita' told from Lolita's point of view." Capital Stage had good timing picking "Drive," what with child sexual abuse in the news (Penn State) and the play being revived on Broadway in February.
On Nov. 2, voters stated emphatically that significant tax increases aren't an option. So budget choices made by Kasich and the Republican-run legislature will adversely impact a great many Ohioans.

But six ounces poured into a half-pint glass looks complete, tidy and altogether drinkable. Minutes later, when that glass is empty, we rinse it out and fill it up with half of another bottle, another style of brew. That's a good little beer-sharing experience if you ask me.
Obama said that his 2010 health care law already recognizes that states need flexibility to do things their way. "Alabama is not going to have exactly the same health needs as Massachusetts or California or North Dakota. We believe in that flexibility," he said.

Ever since former President Bill Clinton's attempt at sweeping reform went down to defeat, thanks in no small measure to insurers' opposition, the issue has been locked in a stalemate. But the turnover in Congress, coupled with growing pressure from business and labor leaders feeling the pain of rising costs, could open the way for at least some progress.
It was a fabulous, exuberant collection, and the most touching moment came at the end, when Mastroianni took her bow, then trotted down the runway to pull Apfel to her feet so she could be recognized. At first the older woman refused, looking embarrassed, but then acquiesced and let Mastroianni pull her to her feet and onto the runway. As they took a bow together, the crowd cheered, then rose to its feet.

As for birds, I found strikingly beautiful specimens seemingly everywhere. Actually, I didn't find them; they found me me. Toucans frolicked in the trees during my visit to the Cabañas Armonía hostel's orchid garden. Ten minutes out on one of our expeditions up an abandoned road, a brilliantly red cock-of-the-rock eyed us imperiously from a tree branch 50 feet away. The birds with their puffed heads and brilliant red color are prize sightings, and I "bagged" mine from the seat of my guide's van. Hummingbirds by the dozens fluttered just outside my room and around the 500-acre nature reserve of my hotel, El Séptimo Paraíso (Seventh Heaven). Best of all, unlike the journeys undertaken by my naturalist heroes, my trip involved no sacrifice of creature comforts. Mindo, a town of about 15,000, and its environs are filled with a variety of hotels, from basic to luxury. Seventh Heaven, where rooms go for about $150 a night, was on the expensive side of the spectrum. On the other end is the Cabañas Armonía, perfectly adequate and going for $16 per person a night.
A survey of 6,425 consumers who belong to Enterprise Plus, a loyalty program, found that 45 percent of weekend renters say they rented more often in 2011 than the year before. Asked for what occasions they rent for a weekend, 90 percent of the Enterprise customers said they use them for weekend getaways. And when asked why they rent instead of using the car they own, the top three reasons are to avoid putting extra miles on their car (48 percent), confidence that the rental car is well maintained and not having to worry about the car they own having mechanical problems (33 percent), and to have a more fuel-efficient vehicle for the trip (31 percent).

Today's heroin is usually snorted, rather than injected. It has become a 'soft drug," in the eyes of many teens, not much different than marijuana, ecstasy, and other party drugs. Many teens start by using prescription pain killers such as Percocet, often legitimately after a sports injury or surgery. This leads to prescription drug abuse, and heroin is often the next step.
"I had better numbers last year but felt more confident this year," Camacho said. "I felt like I could hit the holes harder. Once I hit them, I could explode."

It's already happening in New York City.
