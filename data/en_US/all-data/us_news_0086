Mamet constructs a taut, one-act legal procedural, with questions of innocence and evidence tossed around as deftly the blue rubber ball that the two partners play catch with while brainstorming theories about the case. At the same time, he grafts on a running editorial, advancing a strangely reductive view of identity politics and social relations and a set of fixed notions about how people act accordingly.

It wasn't the vision Kayler had in 2005, when the housing market was still booming and lumber prices soared. He simply sought to take one fallen urban tree and not waste the wood. He would cut it up and use it for lumber.
Critics charge that the institute overweights the cost of motor fuels at 15 to 20 percent of our everyday spending. And because gasoline went up so much last year, that exaggerated the index's overall price rise.

The hotels assigned to delegations are divided closely between Pinellas and Hillsborough, while Texas and Louisiana are just across the Pasco County line at Saddlebrook. Long bus rides are inevitable with some 50,000 attending the convention. Florida Republicans who attended the 2008 convention had bus commutes of nearly an hour from their hotel across from the Mall of America to downtown St. Paul.
So that's the dilemma. Every game the Berserkers win takes them a step away from a chance at a really good player. Every game they lose moves them closer to the bottom, which means a shot at the top. I trust that's clear. They won't ever be the worst team in the league, but they could increase their odds in the lottery and maybe revive the franchise through the draft.

That small technological advance notwithstanding, the board is profoundly simple and effective. Whenever I go through its prescribed drills -- series of tilts, lunges and squats -- I'm always amazed at how easy the models make it look but how hard I'm actually working and how sore it leaves my legs.
The California Department of Transportation is to begin replacing dozens of center-divider posts on Highway 12 between Rio Vista and Suisun City this morning.

The spectacle of people queued outside at midday on a major thoroughfare in all weathers might signal, I don't know, an unemployment center or a methadone clinic or a newly released Apple gizmo. But if it's the 600 block of Southeast Morrison Street along which that line snakes, then it's to do with sandwiches: big, flavorful, glorious and yet humble and sincere sandwiches only available at lunchtime. Chefs Tommy Habetz and Nick Wood have tony restaurant pedigrees, but their work here is all about comfort food -- meats and fishes and cheeses and veggies and sauces stacked between a couple of pieces of bread (or, often, between the two sides of a roll or bun). The flavors are immense and (this matters) familiar: Bunk doesn't so much reinvent the sandwiches it serves as define them: This is a grilled cheese, it tells us, this is an Italian meat sandwich. Everything is elemental and true: food that speaks for itself in a language we all already know. Work your way through this menu and the only mystery remaining about that perennial line outside is: "How come it isn't longer?"

But beyond her eternal age-capture -- killer sexy meets electro-platinum meets playful sparkle meets insecure sadness meets lonely pill-popping death -- is the limitless fascination with Marilyn the person and Marilyn the myth. And, really, nearly 50 years after her death (she died on Aug. 5, 1962, in Brentwood, Calif.) myth replaces about 90 percent of the reality. Your soul is not allowed to take deep breaths once you've been dubbed an "American Icon." Legend is what sells once you've become, like Elvis, a permanent fixture in the pop-culture pantheon.

The Los Angeles Times labeled the biography "a dark and terrifying story" and said, "There could be no better guide than Montefiore. He has uncovered a mind-blowing amount of material from archives in Russia and Georgia. If the narrative sometimes seems to sink into an endless cycle of exploit, arrest, exile, affair, escape, that's just the way Stalin lived. The ultimate effect of 'Young Stalin' is to create a haunting, meticulous and compelling story of a man well worth trying to understand."

* The Browns will probably not face Colts quarterback Peyton Manning in week two. The Colts released a statement today saying that Manning's rehab from neck surgery has slowed and that he's doubtful for their opener. Instead, the Browns will probably face Kerry Collins.

øThe most recent poll of members of the American Association of Individual Investors shows that only 31.2% are bullish, which is below the 39% long-term average and the 38% of bulls at the market peak in April 2011. Still, the level of bullishness is far from excessive, as it's way below the level of around 60% bulls that marked tops in 2000 and 2007. But another sentiment poll tracked by Zimmermann is nearly as bullish as it was near the peaks in 2007 and 2000.

Teachers want to guide their students to ask insightful questions, offer well-reasoned opinions, and work diligently until they master content. Those are the types of classroom experiences that unleash students' ingenuity and reveal their understanding of the material. It's not that it's impossible to achieve that in a virtual environment, but it is vastly more difficult and requires all participants to be motivated and involved. In a classroom, a teacher can see when students aren't motivated and participating and can make adjustments. It's harder when the student is miles away on a computer.

Does anyone doubt, though, who would pay the price if the Knicks (35-35) -- who have slipped to the No. 7 spot in the East -- don't right the ship? Coach Mike D'Antoni has one season left on his contract, and you have wonder what the odds are that he stays through it.

He also adds prosciutto scraps, which imparts a deep flavor. And diners love them.

"Were you ever there when they had to change a keg?" Ms. Klein inquired. I can't say I was. Then again, I can't say I wasn't. I undoubtedly had other things on my mind besides the supply chain, just as long as the malted barley and hops stream continued unabated. "They had a trap door in the floor. It was one of the escapes during Prohibition days. So they would keep the kegs down there."

Their hooves don't have cloven toes. Their feet are much more round. It acts like a snowshoe. It's amazing how much hair they grow under their toes in the winter. In the summer, it'll shed with the rest of their coat.
At least one committee move was widely hailed, especially amid an election-year fight over who is doing more for Israel—Obama or Republicans.
The role he's playing now — the rich Wall Street guy whose wife drives two Caddies and who enjoys firing people who give him bad service — isn't working with the working class. Those are the people Barack Obama has trouble attracting. So the Republicans nominate the one guy who has the same issues?
Reines, who took over the office on Monday, said the dismissals were not related to the ongoing federal corruption investigation.

The 16-member committee is divided between utility and industry officials and representatives of federal and state regulatory agencies, along with a lone official from the National Transportation Safety Board.
The story is short (less than an hour long) and straightforward, the telling here aided by the evocative folk music composed by Black Prairie and a dusky, dusty palette of Don Crossley’s lighting. Director Marcella Crowson gets big-hearted performances, especially from the stage veteran Damon Kupper as Jack’s tense, struggling father and from Ashlee Waldbauer and the young, real-life siblings Jack and Steele Clevenger as the family’s children.
Our own backyard: Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, a former geologist, restaurateur and brew pub founder, who was sitting next to Brown, offered an unconventional observation.

The Yankees, one figures, would be interested in dumping Burnett — who still has two years and $33 million left on what looks like a disastrous contract — onto someone else to free up cash to pursue another bat. With Jesus Montero gone, there is a void at designated hitter. There is interest in both Johnny Damon and Carlos Pena, but the Yankees would prefer a lower-price option.
Yvonne Tucker rushed to a shelter with about 60 of her neighbors at Pinaire Mobile Home Park. She said people were crying and screaming, and the shelter's lights went out when the twister hit. When they came back outside, they found several homes destroyed, including Tucker's.
Clergy, and maybe especially women clergy, can get caught up in some strange dynamics. People want to see us as spiritual leaders, somehow above all this worldly nonsense, but they too can be distracted by appearances-not just our weight, but our hair, our makeup or lack thereof, our jewelry, and perhaps especially our clothing. (I can't tell you how many times people have told me that I'm lucky my "uniform" is all black because we all know that black is so slimming! Do they say that to male clergy? I truly have no idea.)

Then there's the racing. In shorts and short sleeves, between lush islands that include a few owned by the likes of business moguls Richard Branson and Dr. Henry Jarecki.
Then came Saturday, which started peacefully enough - a midday rally at City Hall and a march. But hours later, the scene near downtown Oakland had dramatically deteriorated: clashes punctuated by rock and bottle throwing by protesters and volleys of tear gas from police, and a City Hall break-in that left glass cases smashed, graffiti spray-painted on walls and an American flag burned.

Dr. Gerard Mullin, a gastroenterologist, nutritionist and director of Integrative GI Nutrition Services at Johns Hopkins Hospital, said he used to be "vigilant" about ordering the tests.

"I had the world record in the 100 already," Bolt said. "All I wanted to do was win, pretty much. But I saw I could get the world record in the 200, so I went out there tonight and told myself to leave everything on the track."
Last week's episode gave us bombs over Orange County, and now the ladies are looking to calm their nerves with a nice wine and cheese party. We start the episode with Vicki accompanying Tamra to a lingerie store as she attempts to fit her new “girls” into a new bra. I don’t even mind that the camera follows them into the dressing room. The threat of a nip slip doesn’t faze me — I’m just excited because tonight there is very little Heather exposure!

While the pop-up design has been used elsewhere as a gimmick, in Christchurch it meant that storeowners - and residents - could resume business in weeks instead of the months it would take to rebuild with standard construction methods.

So it goes. Lars von Trier's latest film, and his most accessible in ages, is definitely not for everyone, in a way reminiscent of Terrence Malick's "The Tree of Life," for which it could serve as a sort of companion piece.

"Nobody talks about it, but when they get set at 22, 23 feet and just flat get after you, I saw teams that just couldn't handle that," he said. "They can really pressure and just disrupt you."
"He's got to get more consistent but I thought he made a lot of progress this year and I think vindicated our decision to stick with him."

In addition to photographs and paintings, displays include a buckboard wagon, a hand-cranked kraut cutter used to turn cabbage into kraut, a cider press and a barn loom.
Funny, then, that so much about the Monster Ball is deliberately goofy. The dancing, staging, lights, and set design are spectacular; they're also often yoked to set pieces laden with Broadway schtick. On "Paparazzi," Lady Gaga battles a giant puppet sea creature; on "Teeth" and "Alejandro," her expressive dancers are asked to make like beasts from a horror movie. Then there's all the fake blood, and the outrageous costumes, and the constant pleas for audience members to put up their paws. Because they're beasts, too, and Gaga is Mother Monster. Which means... well, I'm not really sure I want to think too hard about what that means.
Ellen Davis, vice president of the National Retail Federation, said people typically shop Black Friday more aggressively in a down economy, and stores rise to the occasion with competitive deals.
Orlando to a 3-1 week, posting point-rebound double-doubles in all four contests. Howard has 14 consecutive double-doubles and an Eastern Conference best 44 on the season.

At one point during Saturday's practice, Batum found himself looking around at his teammates and a surprising revelation dawned on him.

Twenty-one seconds later, Rice helped his team regain the momentum with the first of six straight touchdowns when he and Petty hooked up on a 64-yard catch and run TD with 6:09 left in the half. Rice then found Demond Champion for a 54-yard score with 2:32 to go and Andre Sims caught a Rice TD pass with 1:04 remaining in the half as Gateway led 34-14 at halftime.

Rumored lineups have circulated widely, as they usually do, and Lollapalooza itself stoked the speculation in recent weeks via a series of CTA and online advertisements that seemed to hint at who would be playing.
In the end, these warrantless raids ended up being such a bust and attracting such national attention that the Department of Business and Professional Regulation said late last week that it wouldn't team up with the Sheriff's Office to do another one until it could conduct a full review of what happened here.
However, local economists who reviewed the annual report on Baltimore's core — the area within a one-mile radius of the intersection of Pratt and Light streets — said any job loss likely was far less severe than the data indicated.
It takes a tough man to tear out the interior of a rare, meticulously restored 1949 O'Mahoney diner, then follow that by almost gutting a companion 1952 Mountain View diner in equally exquisite repair. Clyde Mart, the 80-year-old raconteur/restaurateur, knows that there's no crying in the restaurant business. If something's not working, you'd better figure out something that will. And these diners had already had three previous owners in almost eight years of . . . well, not working. In December 2009, Mart launched Clyde's Bistro and Barroom. Was the "desecration" worth it? And how. A few classic diner items remain on the menu -- burgers, fries, meatloaf -- but Mart definitely raised the comfort-food bar along with the decor. Meanwhile, he has kept most menu prices at a comfortably low level.

The change highlights a contradiction among court venues. Visitors can tote cellphones into the St. Clair County Building in Belleville, which houses the courts there, but not the federal court in East St. Louis. Phones are allowed in federal court in St. Louis and state court in St. Louis County; the St. Louis Circuit Court says it allows cellphones without cameras.
Although more than two-thirds of its nearly 300 students are low-income, the school excels.

The Celtics were the better team in the series, which isn't breaking news. They had a better plan, better poise, way better execution. If the Cavs had given better focus and better effort in Games 2, 4 and 5, then they might have had a chance to stretch it out. But none of the four losses were truly close. Game 5 will be the scar from the series and, no matter what anyone says, it will hang over the top of LeBron James for a long time.

What's more, the disaster and its aftermath revealed just how far some companies had pushed the just-in-time supply system.

øDE: Chris Long, Rams - The No. 2 pick of the 2008 draft turned in his best season, posting a career-high 13 sacks. He's also tough at the point of attack and tough in the run game. J.J. Watt, Texans - If you didn't know his name before the postseason, you do after watching his momentum-swinging pick six of the Bengals and 2.5-sack day in Baltimore. More than justified Houston's investment of the 11th overall pick in him last spring. Chris Clemons, Seahawks - One of the best speed rushers in the game, he's registered 11 sacks each of the past two years. He also posted a career-best 51 tackles in 2011 and forced three fumbles. Red Bryant, Seahawks - You don't find many 6-4, 323-pounders at this position. But Bryant has anchored Seattle's impressive run defense the past two years, helping it limit opponents to 3.8 yards per carry in 2011. Calais Campbell, Cardinals - It's hard to get sacks out of a three-man front, but he had eight in 2011. The 6-8, 300-pounder also made 72 tackles, swatted 10 passes and tied Bryant for the league lead by blocking three field goals. Jeremy Mincey, Jaguars - Jacksonville finally finds a reliable option (57 tackles, 8 sacks, 4 forced fumbles) at what's long bee a problem spot for the team. But now the Jags may lose Mincey to free agency.

The National Park Service describes the South Dakota Badlands as one of the planet's fastest-eroding landscapes. What you see today will in some way be different tomorrow. The Badlands also are a geological gem boasting a poetic blend of simple grandiosity and rugged natural beauty.

It sounds like a fad, but it's more than that, as recent research shows just how bad it is for our bodies to sit for hours a day. It not only slows metabolism but increases the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, as insulin effectiveness drops with lack of movement. The enzymes responsible for breaking down lipids and triglycerides also plunge, and that causes HDL, the good cholesterol, to fall.

"Deep down … we all believe we're God," Henry finally admits as he struggles through the Harpooners' pivotal final game, an inevitable but still irresistible Cinderella story. Shaken, humbled and inarguably transformed, Henry is talking as much about the superstitious fan who freezes between pitches as he is the idea that even the most tightly controlled among us can lead a life free of errors. It's overcoming that fallacy where the real art lies for Henry — and for so many of us in the stands as well.
So with the Hawks rebuilding and the Spartans still strong, visiting Central figured to have its hands full with its Suburban North Conference rival Saturday, and that indeed was the case. Despite having 10 penalties for 67 yards and turning the ball over three times, East rolled to a 36-18 win.

In the most extreme case, the auditors found that in October 2008 the agency asked the board to approve a $16 million contract for inspection services at a time when $15.4 million remained from the previous contract for such work in the same district. Two months later, with $30 million still available for such services, the SHA went back to the board for an additional $16 million. Almost a year later, with $36.5 million unspent, the agency sought $10 million more.

If "The Blair Witch Project" gave birth to this sort of thing, the Internet era, with video blogs and YouTube postings of seemingly every utterance that crossed the mind of anyone with a camera handy made films such as "Cloverfield" inevitable.

The food is excellent at the Kahala, but eating three meals a day there would bankrupt one of those princes of the emirates who stop in from time to time. Like many other visitors, I would make a daily run to Whole Foods at the Kahala Mall. There's the usual array of cooked meats and fish, fresh baked goods, papaya to split open and spritz with lime, Maui-style ribs (good hot or cold), and lots of beer by the six-pack and wine at the high end of reasonable (especially when compared to resort prices). The area around the mall also has restaurants and bars and, if you must, fast food.

Tonight, as Miami hosts the Cardinals for the ballpark's grand opening, if a Marlin hits a home run it will spin into action for the first time.

Most Republicans opposed the measure because it would add $34 billion to a national debt that has hit $13 trillion, arguing that it should have been paid for with cuts to other programs, such as unspent money from last year's economic stimulus bill, which is earning mixed grades at best from voters as unemployment stands at 9.5 percent nationwide.
O'Leary usually scatters pretty quick after games. He addresses the team in the locker room, meets with the press longer than he wants and then hops on his golf cart, wife in tow, dodging lingering fans with such daring behind the wheel that it's all the missus can do to hang on, as hubby skedaddles off to wherever it is veteran college football coaches go on Saturday game nights.

That Mills has reached this position is nothing short of astonishing. The Blazers' management group didn't expect him to show up for training camp in the fall because rookie Armon Johnson had earned the Blazers' 15th and final roster spot during summer league. And even after he showed up, Mills' odds of making the team featured the words, "slim," and "none." He's not even listed in the Blazers' media guide.
A key feature of the proposal is allowing local residents to vote on whether to increase taxes higher than the cap allows.

Several Democratic activists have accused me of trying to turn Democrats into "Republican-lite," devoid of core party principles. Not true. If Democratic activists are satisfied with the current ping-pong battle for control of government, they can ignore party moderates. But if they want a sustained hold on power, Democrats need moderates. With a sustained grasp on the mechanisms of government, Democrats could begin to rebuild voters' trust in government through moderate and incremental policies. Once trust has been restored, larger reforms may be possible. At present, lack of trust in government will derail the emergence of a truly progressive majority any time soon.

Worlds apart: Congress is as polarized as it has been in at least 30 years. So reports National Journal, which has been rating members of the House and Senate on a left-right continuum since 1982. With moderates harder than ever to find in either party or on either side of the Hill, last year's second session of the 111th Congress was the most sharply divided yet. Not a single Republican rated as more liberal than the most conservative Democratic senator. Over on the House side, only five Republicans had voting records to the left of Mississippi Democrat Gene Taylor, a long-time outlier in his caucus. Not that it did Taylor much good: He was swept out of office in November by a Republican who castigated him for helping make Nancy Pelosi speaker.

If you're expecting explanations of the dishes, you won't find them here. On all visits, I had to ask what I was eating, and the explanations generally went no further than "you have duck with escarole," never mentioning that it's crusted in coriander and that the stylized apostrophes on either side are made of a huckleberry black olive sauce. I'm not sure why servers aren't more forthcoming -- surely it's not because they don't know the food -- because the menu isn't that large, and the selections don't change much.

2. An overriding theme gave the "30 Rock" sketches — cutaways, really — a cohesive feel. Each existed within its own world, and yet felt as if it belonged to a larger comedic idea. And it freed up jokes within each of those sketches to range out into non sequitur territory, if only for a beat.
