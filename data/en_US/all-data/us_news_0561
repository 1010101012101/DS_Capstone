Aron Anderson hopes that won't be the case. He wants the district to remove the current letter from his son's file and replace it with a letter that more clearly reflects what happened.

By most accounts, the stock is rising for trophy rainbow trout making their annual spring migration from the deep water impoundment of Elevenmile Reservoir to the upstream shallows of the South Platte known as the "Dream Stream."

Hill, meanwhile, wowed everyone at the combine with his speed, ability and measurables. But he played in a triple-option offense at Georgia Tech. He has to morph into a big-play guy for the Jets. Maybe he will — receiving passes from either Mark Sanchez or Tim Tebow — or maybe he won’t.

One of my debate opponents argued that Mr. Breivik represents some kind of worrisome Western trend -- from the rising popularity of "far-right" parties in Europe to the American tea party movement.

Richard Justice, MLB.com: "Ryan Braun is about to learn just how precious a good name is. When one is lost, it's usually lost forever. He now faces the monumental challenge of trying to get his back. Here's hoping he understands that he only gets one chance. When he discusses the matter publicly on Friday, he should tell the entire story, from beginning to end, warts and all. He only has to do it once, but he has to understand there aren't any do-overs.

He's fighting for something way more important than a 50-game suspension. He also appears to be fighting an uphill battle."

This simple pastry - they resemble large, inflated muffins, but are hollow - comes together in almost no time and calls for just a handful of ingredients. Even better, the batter can be made the night ahead. And because popovers aren't particularly sweet, they work as well for dessert (their fillings can be sweet) as they do for breakfast.

Plus, as Manningham showed when he ran the wrong route on the next play after the big catch in the Super Bowl, he still makes the occasional mental mistake. As I said in my Super Bowl XLVI game review, the sideline catch is why he'll get paid but the next play is why it won't be by the Giants.

The NFC East has three Pro Bowl quarterbacks – McNabb, the Cowboys' Tony Romo and the Giants' Eli Manning – and Kevin Kolb. Kolb will outplay them all.

First, people like me in the media will forever refer to those "losers" as Oscar-nominated so-and-so in news stories and columns. Trust me, if you and that person go down in the same plane crash, the story will begin: "Oscar-nominated actor so-and-so and 140 nobodies perished when their plane..." It's been that way since the Titanic sunk in 1912, and The New York Times headline declared that John Jacob Astor and 1,500 others died in that tragic sinking. The most famous person in a tragedy always gets top billing, and Oscar-nominated people are more famous than you. That's show biz.

The '70s were a great time to be in Cleveland. Literally, I was at music clubs or concerts every night of the week, for years. The offerings were spectacular. The Agora, of course, was at the top of my list, but there were a hundred clubs and concert venues, the armories and the Hullabaloo Clubs, It's Boss, the Viking Saloon, the Roundtable, Utopia, Atomic Alps, the Plato, on and on. I went to them all. The music scene in Cleveland was like being a kid in a candy factory. You could have as much as you wanted, and I wanted it all.

Scene two: My wife and I arrive at an open-air restaurant. Only a few tables are occupied. We see several idle servers at the nearby bar but they don't see us, or pretend not to. After being ignored for a few moments we seat ourselves. Minutes pass. A server walks past us with food for another party, but we are still invisible. Finally, I march up to bar and ask for menus. The service after that by the college-age server is bad yet cheerful, meaning she does not care, or has no clue what good service is.

Short stuff: Speaking of Dwight: Love the guy and want him to stay, but nothing drives me crazier than this notion that the Magic must make a move before the trade deadline just to show Dwight they are committed to winning.
