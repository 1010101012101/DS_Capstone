An opening chapter helpfully reviews the career of NT Wright as scholar, theologian and Churchman. This is followed by a chapter outlining Kuhrt’s own story and his interest in NT Wright. In this chapter Kuhrt, writing from an evangelical Anglican tradition Kuhrt poses some thoughtful questions to that evangelical tradition which still await an answer. Of course, he goes on to suggest the NT Wright does begin to offer an answer to these questions. This chapter should not be passed over by readers of Life and Work, as the questions raised by Kuhrt reflect questions that need to be asked and answered by an evangelical reformed/Presbyterian tradition just as much as by evangelicals within the Anglican tradition.

Last year, 2010, spring in Britain was ‘late’, as it followed the previous winter’s heavy freeze; so the first crop circle to emerge did not occur in the month of April, but on May 5th (Old Beltane), in alignment with an ancient sacred stronghold (and site of the first Salisbury cathedral) at Old Sarum. Its appearance was eagerly awaited by the crop circle community because the earliest farming crop to start into flower –oil seed rape, canola– was only just out of the ‘green’ stage. Previous years had brought early ripening and, by comparison, the 2010 season had a lot to make up for.
Roman surgery was supposed to be for 1:30 which anyone with a child, let alone an autistic child knows making them go without food or drink all day is torture!...well they didn't take him in until after 2:30 so by that time he was irate beyond belief.

Amber did. She grabbed the edge of the seat with her left hand as they raced through the streets of London so fast they were a blur. She couldn’t take her eyes off the road and the cars as they swerved around them, barely missing each one. Her heart lodged in her throat, her right hand trembling where she held it out in front of her. What was happening? It felt as though she had slipped into some dreadful fantasy world and she wanted out.

As I was doing the research, I was not surprised to find the number of post cards using images from the Civil War. After all, Memorial Day was originally called Decoration Day and was established to memorialize the Civil War dead. What did surprise me was the number of post cards that used images from the Revolutionary War. Those that harkened back to the early days mostly included images from Lady Liberty, but some used people such as General Washington–even though he had not died in battle.

So it is with great excitement that I await Lower Den‘s sophomore album, Nootropics. And I can say now that it is worth the wait. Named appropriately after the smart drug and memory enhancer, Nootropics is even more psychedelic and experimental than its predecessor. There’s a dullness to the steadying beats of the songs that lulls you to a sense of discomfort that is paradoxically enjoyable.
A rose apple should be eaten when there is no green shade left, only yellowish white. The flesh is thin and there is a large hollow with 1-2 seeds. The flesh is very tasty, dry, and so a perfect fruit during a car drive. This is Eric’s favourite.
We renamed her Luna because Samson's name means Sun, and Luna means Moon. They are definitely night and day of one another. Apparently there's a biblical story of Samson and Delilah and we should have named her Delilah, but Luna is simpler.
Who would have imagined that the slice of garlic bread that you just served to your family for dinner contained human hair? Yes, you are reading that right…human hair!! It can be found in many baked goods such as, bread, pizza crusts, cake doughnuts, bagels, and cookies. Human hair is listed on the ingredient panel as L-Cysteine. It is a non -essential amino acid that is added to these foods to enhance the stretchiness of the dough. L-cysteine is isolated through a chemical process by dissolving the human hair in acid. The source of L-Cysteine is not limited to only human hair, but to chicken and duck feathers, cow horns, and petroleum by-products.

Joe was no stranger to sex. His reputation preceded him. He was very experienced. A man whore some might say. I, on the other hand, was not. To say I was inexperienced was an understatement. I'm serious. My best friend and I thought oral sex consisted of 2 people talking about sex. Joe must have seen the hesitation on my face. He said, "That's OK, I can bring some out." And that was exactly what he did. He showed me his clothes. IOU sweatshirts, Guess jeans, fancy tennis shoes. He told me how his mom had a garage sale and the following Monday all of the kids from school started showing up in his clothes. I tried to look interested, but seriously WTH? This was so not the way I imagined our first date would be.

I was actually talking to Chas about this little dilemma while we were at the farm last weekend. You see, I had brought our DSLR and planned on taking some nice photos of us there but ended up purposely leaving the camera in the car. Sometimes, I just want to enjoy the moment and the experience without having to worry about carrying around a big camera and getting good pics, ya know? When I feel like taking pictures becomes more of a chore than anything else, that's the signal that blogging is playing a bigger role in my life than it should.

We have a number of walnut trees at our new house, but there is this one in particular that grows huge walnuts. State Fair prize winner sized walnuts. I mean, look at that thing! In the past week, those green hulls have started cracking open, almost like flowers to reveal the walnuts inside of them. We’ve been having great fun collecting them, my youngest son and I. One of his favorite activities at school is the nut cracking activity and knowing that his teacher is always in need of walnuts, he runs out there to collect her a bag as often as he thinks of it.

You could find yourself in a position where you have to claim a disability benefit, either for yourself, or, like me, for someone else.

I feel concerned. Most of the Christians I observe are quick to quote(or paraphrase ideas) from the Bible but seem very reluctant to think for themselves. God gave us minds…I think we should use them! I think God means for us to think for ourselves. Thoughts informed by Scripture are fine and necessary, but the Christian mind ought to be able to produce individual thought.

Seeing off competition from Orange-prize listed The Sealed Letter author Emma Donoghue, Jean Kwok, Tom Lee, Robert Minhinnick and Linda Oatman High, Barry’s tale was described by judge Melvyn Bragg as a story which “takes a disregarded and often scorned stratum of male pals and finds wit, pathos and great energy.”

10. Aerodynamics of Gender: Number 10 was a big debate for me between this episode and Critical Film Studies. Ultimately, though, this one could never not make my top 10 list, for one simple reason: trampoline. The trampoline plot had me laughing the entire time. It’s so perfectly simple: Jeff and Troy find a trampoline, feel happy, and then Pierce destroys it. The twist at the end is funny just for coming out of nowhere, but they manage to add onto the ridiculousness of it with “It’s gonna be a maze.” The A-plot in this episode was fine, but the B-plot is what made this one a great episode.
No I love you, you
Perhaps most lackluster of all is the whole android doppelganger thing (“Who’s the real Doctor?” or “Who’s the real Sarah?”), which is a thoroughly played out and well worn sci-fi trope, even if it was used as recently as the latest series in the Ganger two-parter. I guess for some people this gimmick still works, but I can go the rest of my pop culture-imbibing life without seeing any more of these types of stories. It’s also the final story for both Sgt. Benton (John Levene) and Harry Sullivan (Ian Marter) and neither character ever gets to even remotely shine. Granted, nobody really knew these guys wouldn’t be back, but it’s something of a shame that they didn’t have better moments to exit on.

Yellow also has it’s useful and down sides. Yellow is the color of caution (as in the yellow traffic light) or hazards. Yellow is sometimes associated with illness (jaundice) and a lack of courage (yellow-bellied). There are cultures where yellow corresponds with jealousy, avarice, dishonesty, and weakness. Yellow and green were both used to symbolize the devil and death during the Middle Ages. Yellow is the color of mourning in Egypt. It is the color of courage in Japan.

Then six years later, last year, we toured Kenyan British curriculum high schools for FirstBorn's transition. Felt keen on the options. Picked a first choice. Relaxed. And then realised with a parental doubletake around six months later that actually, while that was the preferred choice for lots of her mates too, of course we wouldn't be here then. We are here in Kenya for Tom's work. And before FirstBorn finishes GCSE we'll be elsewhere, also abroad, in a yet to be defined location, but most likely, mid-GCSEs, in a country where the schools are not a patch on those in Kenya or UK. Oooeeer.

The Lazy Days was very easy to drink but not lacking in flavour, it was the palest of the three but hadn't much of the hoppiness I was expecting. Instead, there was a light creamy sweetness to the beer, not unlike Hexhamshire Whapweasel, but with that Batemans-esque taste that the brewer suggested maybe Lincolnshire water.

I’ve noticed that I rarely forage for wild plants anymore without being barefoot. Honestly: it make things so much easier, it’s so simple to find out where the soil becomes more humid, or warm, or sandy. With your bare feet, it’s a piece of cake to find out where the sun exactly was half an hour ago, as you feel right away where the earth is still glowing. It might be the no.1 simplest way to look for plants, especially those that only grow in very specific circumstances. A quest for plants that becomes a total sensuous experience.
So what do we do? Celebrate it! I'm not talking about celebrating that Yuengling blew past Boston Beer, I'm talking about celebrating that a family-owned brewer has beaten the mass-marketing of the nationals on their own turf -- mainstream lager -- and done it with a "full calorie" beer, the stuff they apparently have forgotten how to sell. That's freakin' awesome.

Yes, He will! And if you have a job or other sources of income, He already is providing for you! But nowhere in Scripture is His provision for us portrayed as a means to rescue us from our own laziness or foolishness. God has provided me with a wonderful job that I've had for nearly 10 years. But does that mean I can use my money in whatever way I want because "God will provide"? Not at all! A sizable number of Jesus' parables were about stewardship--how we use (or misuse) the resources He allows us to have. Paul wrote in 1 Corinthians 3:10-14:
Why is that? Why would it be so much harder to answer the question, even if it was just asking the flip-side of a question that would be so simple? I wish I knew.

Going even further back in history, you can read Thomas J. Craughwell’s The Rise and Fall of the Second Largest Empire in History, that of Genghis Khan and the Mongols ($19.99, Fair Winds, Quayside Publishing, large format softcover.) Emerging out of the vast steppe grasslands of Central Asia in the early 1200s, the Mongols quickly carved out an empire that, by the late 13th century, included one-sixth of the Earth’s landmass, from Eastern Europe to the eastern shore of Asia. Extensively illustrated, the author brings that piece of history to life in a lively text. The focus on Asia since the end of World War Two has been on China and, in particular, the Peoples Republic or communist China. I doubt that anyone in the West can even grasp what it must have been like to grow up in that society whose “transformation” by Mao Te Sung and the party cost millions their lives and was irrationally disruptive. One of the best accounts of what it was like during those years is Red Circle: China and Me 1949-2009 by Stephen Songsheng Chen ($19.95, Author House). It is a story of a family branded capitalist exploiters and suffering the ordeal of surviving in the mad world of communist ideology. To understand the China that Richard Nixon “opened up” to the West and the turmoil of the years until Mao’s death, as well as the remarkable embrace of capitalist economic principles that followed, there is probably no better book available today.

6. I can't believe how many running events are hosted by Disney. They all sound REALLY fun and I can see why people are hooked. I am a HUGE Disney fan. I am just not sure I'd want to spend even one second of a Disney vacation getting up at 4 am to run and then be tired. It seems there are races every few weeks at one of the parts and people always seem so happy. And it seems that Disney races have turned some people into runners. A new-to-me blog especially for Disney fans is EAT, SLEEP, RUN DISNEY. I guess if you have to run long distances, having Disney characters cheer you on is the best way to do it.

First up was the Chacuterie plate, and all I can say about this is wow! This was absolute heaven, loaded up with prosciutto from pig raised in Missouri, a salami of sorts from New Jersey I think, and a ham of sorts from Virginia. All 3 meats on this plate were to die for, however, the prosciutto melted in your mouth, and was absolutely amazing. You can see that fatty prosciutto near the top at the picture, and words cannot describe this heaven. There were also 2 pates, both made from pork if I remember correctly, and these are made in house and delicious. The one on the left was the rillette, and had some great clove and cinnamon spice to it, while the one pictures above was amazing as well. Add some crusty French bread, and this is something that I could nosh on several days a week for lunch, or even dinner. Awesome.

The attacks of September 11, 2001, opened the floodgates and provided the foundation for mainstreaming the use of torture and dismissing moral objections to the practice. Abu Ghraib, the torture memos of John Yoo, and the award-winning Fox TV series 24 all acted as a sadistic pornography that worked like slow acid to desensitize much of the public to what had been previously unthinkable and regarded as incompatible with the tenets of Christianity and modern civilization.

This brunch made me feel like I was at home. I was totally reminded of hot Atlanta summers and hungover Sunday brunches. While I might have forgotten how to count American coins, I'll never forget what it felt like to eat in Atlanta, where brunch is for champions who require food to fill the holes in their bellies, due to a combination of excessive beer-drinking and the sweltering heat. Cheers to the American South.

The Boers have been victims of colonization. Particularly when many died in the British concentration camps during the Anglo-Boer War which lead to the conquest & annexation of the Boer Republics into the new macro state of South Africa.

UPDATE: Apparently the studio didn’t like people seeing Ian Joyner’s concept art that they didn’t use. His gallery of the images now reads: “We had a request from the studio to not show this work at this time. I will update this page if/when things change.” Given that the io9 article has had over 33K views, and the art is still there for viewing/fuskering and isn’t going to just disappear from the internet, I’m not sure what point they are making besides strong-arming an artist: “Don’t make us look bad, little painter man!” Chalk it up as another incident that shows how out of touch with reality Hollywood is.

For one thing, Fidel Castro died years ago, didn’t he? It blows my mind that dead people can come out with these statements and grab all sorts of headlines. Though in theory, I suppose dead people making statements is actually pretty big news, since the vast majority of them say so little. Castro was never exactly the quiet type to begin with, so I guess you’d have to expect him to still be a little bit of a loud mouth even in death.

A lovely mini cauldron and I have already been burning some incense - love the dragons blood - supposedly to repel negativity and for protection. Today it was T's birthday - 6 years old, I cant believe how quickly this time has gone. Aside from the visit to the natural history museum, T had a friend over on Saturday and spent a number of hours playing inside and outside with what it seems likes all T's toys!! T and his friend had a wonderful time and T is already talking about a sleep-over. A great weekend and little if any mony spent.
To help you get started with some content for your files, I have recruited some fantastic guest bloggers that I am super excited about! I have several guest posts on a variety of subjects lined up for the next 3 weeks, and I’m hoping that at least one of these posts will be of a help to each of you. I’ll even be popping in with some content of my own for ya, but I wanted to be sure to branch out on some subjects that I don’t know much about. I’m learning and filling my files, too!

Currently however, the federal government does not specifically fund any of the recommendations.

But, today, I’m gonna talk about the other little people – my family. (I mean seriously, how many Mexican basketball players do you know?) We didn’t have Leprechauns we had the Cucuy. He was our boogeyman. The Cucuy was said to find and eat bad boys and girls. So of course we were traumatized for the first few years of our lives with the Cucuy.
"Why?" he asked. And at that point my heart began to sink a little as I replied, "Michael, that is where all babies grow, in a momma's tummy."

That's not all I wanted to write about it.. her birthday is still coming. That day specifically.. a year ago from Monday.. I gave birth to my sweet little Savanna. As I sit and think about that day.. and how she took us completely by surprise in so many ways.. I also began to think of that person. That other Tabatha. The person I used to be. I find myself envying that person. The 'old' me.. the pre-dead daughter me.. I always knew of all the things that could happen. The things to be aware of. Ways to reduce risks.. but like so many.. I was naive.. I just knew I was the exception to the rule. Nothing would happen to MY daughter.. things like that... that happens to other people. I read about those people, but to me? Nope.. I get a pass.. a get out of jail free card... Clearly.. I am no exception to that 'rule.' and i realize.. I miss being that person sometimes. Because now, now I am afraid of everything. In the end, I know the Lord's purpose will be delivered, and whatever the destiny may be is what shall be done. But I am still human. That thought can only comfort me for so long.. there are still pieces of me that fight the darkness of thinking of EVERYTHING that could go wrong.. not just what happened with us. Miscarriage, stillbirth, diseases, infections... the list could go on forever..

25% across the board discounts on wine if you buy six bottles seem to be the supermarkets' favourite promotional strategy at the moment and this week it's Sainsbury's turn. I haven't had a chance to taste their range since I last flagged up my best buys back in December so I can't recommend any new bargains.
My trips to the gym didn't seem to have any affect on the pounds of fat that I wanted to eliminate before getting into a wedding dress. Exercise also wasn't helping me recognize the stranger I started seeing in photographs of myself. If Facebook had been around, I probably would have untagged myself from all photos simply because I didn't recognize myself. That stranger looked like an overweight stunt double version of me, but it certainly didn't look like the Anne I knew and loved. I always had that weird feeling when I looked at pictures of myself, as many people do- the person in photos feeling different from the person in the mirror, but that's easily explained. A picture is how other people see us, a mirror is a reverse image of our body. I knew what that felt like, but this unrecognizable person just looked like an alien to me, not even a reverse image of myself, more like a "Nutty Professor" version of myself.

2. What is one item in your house that holds the most sentimental value and why? Probably my photo storage box with the letters and whatnot from our last deployment and/or my music box. I keep those odds and ends around not because they're particularly valuable but because they remind me of the person I fell in love with when times get rough. I've got other family heirloom-y things in the house: a 1791 - Klötz violin, a 1921 - player piano, my grandmother's sterling silver tea/coffee service, his grandfather's service flag from his burial. I think the box is what I'd miss most if it were destroyed though.
But swimming alone isn't going to help me. I need something to stop me going backwards, sliding towards the open jaws of the black dog of depression.

At an on-campus coffee shop, Parker, Natalie, and Brenda are listening to the radio program, when Paul walks in. They listen as Parker tells a story about a grisly killing spree that took place in one of the dorms. Stanley Hall, 25 years earlier. Apparently, the killer was a deranged professor who went door-to-door, hacking up anyone unfortunate enough to answer his knock. After allegedly killing an entire floor of students, the professor supposedly took the knife and stabbed himself in the chest.
I felt a little guilty doing all this, including writing this post, while sitting on the steel-truss hammock in the house with two fans keeping me sort of comfortable. I never ask for anything here; it’s just the way things are done.
For now, I’m concentrating on running and the occasional chin-up. While Ma & Pa were here I tried to kick things off with a gentle jog back from dropping the hire car off in Kings Cross. It’s a four to five K run if you go along the main road. But that’s a bit fumey. So I tried to find a more scenic route. 10K later I was back home to a very worried Sarah.

All told, Funimation's Dragon Ball Z Season Four is one of my favorite season sets. Once you get past the Garlic Jr. Saga, you're in for a terrific thrill ride. You get some awesome fights that don't drag on and the season ends with an intriguing mystery. This set can be bought for chump change either online or in stores. If you don't mind the wide screen format, this is an exceptional way to view some awesome DBZ sagas.

Six hours was all I worked that day. Six hours and my legs, back, and feet were stiff and sore. One day later, and it's like I never started at CrossFit-- my thighs are aching as though I'd done a motherload of squats or something. Beth and Mouse said it will get easier.
Marey's images pushed the study of anatomical motion light years ahead. His books: La Machine animales/Animal Mechinism and Le Vol des Oiseaux/ The Flight of Birds, was followed by Le Mouvement in 1894, famously illuminating in great detail many mysteries including how a cat always lands on it's feet and that indeed, all four horse's hooves do leave the ground simultaneously at a full gallop.
I also tend to work out my plot through my characters, so it’s a gradual process of getting to know them. With Darke Academy, the characters are already there and more-or-less fully formed. And of course the other major difference is that I don’t have the final say in the finished product. The company, Hothouse, own the rights to the characters and the book, so their editors can add or change things, though we do discuss most things very thoroughly and there’s plenty of give and take.
The reason we need to feel the weight of this warning is that many Arminians will back off of these verses after realizing what is actually being said. However, there are some Arminians who are consistent with their theology, and they would teach that a Christian who loses their salvation cannot be saved again. It is not enough, therefore, to give cursory attention to this passage. We must understand its warning and the explanation.
Obama may continue to peddle the happy horse manure about green jobs to the True Believers, but he understood that what his EPA director Lisa Jackson was planning with his avid encouragement was a job killer that would have led to nationwide unemployment at California levels and higher prices on energy, food and most goods manufactured in America. Nor could he have blamed it on Congress, since it would have been entirely implemented through the EPA's regulatory apparatus and executive order.

"Children ask better questions than adults. ‘May I have a cookie?’ ‘Why is the sky blue?’ and ‘What does a cow say?’ are far more likely to elicit a cheerful response than ‘Where's your manuscript?’ ‘Why haven't you called?’ and ‘Who's your lawyer?’"
And every once in a while you saw a mother carry a baby to a bar. No one needs a crying infant at a place you want to get drunk at. Also worth mentioning are the high prices for groceries and the outrageous rip-off at the one and only Union Market. Even though it is considered a gourmet store, I had a few fights with the cost-value relationship of the items they offer. What had been known in Flatbush as funny looks towards white people now turned back into the opposite. My Dominican friend once visited me (he is black) and felt very uncomfortable walking the streets of this neighborhood. He claims everyone was observing him, waiting for him to make a wrong move. I wouldn’t know. But it wouldn’t surprise me. I have yet to find an area in which both races are equally accepted. While 7th Avenue is still quite snobby, 5th Avenue can be seen as the Latin part of the hood. Many Hispanic folks live here, own their store, or like to wander around. It is a peculiar aspect of the Slope but it surely exists.
I do not necessarily recommend American History X. There are other films that deal will racial issues in a far more competent, mature manner. If you want to see a good exploration of the absurdity of racism, seek out just about anything else that does not qualify as blaxploitation and you will be better off. Norton is good in this, mind you, and if you are a fan, you should not miss him. Watching the film will leave you longing for a better creative team to have built the film around him, however.

We have black spots in our history, too — which nation is blemish-free? The most famous and often quoted was May 13, 1969. No one wants to be reminded of the ugliness but it was often brought up as a cautionary tale or the bogeyman to keep us in check.
I use to make a tomatoes sauce that is a base and I call Napoli. It is really simple and with this simplicity reminde me my family and my roots. In a saute' pan, saute' the onion in the evo and add the squeeze Tomatoes. You can squeeze by hand or using a potato ricer, depend of you, I use both, by hand sometimes is more faster. Add the salt and cook at medium heat for 15 minutes. When is almost cook add the basil, I love to put a lot of basil. If you want to give just the taste, don't chopped so would be easier for you to take off from the sauce. You can use in many different ways, You can cook more and freeze, I always keep a small container in the fridge, it will be good for a week.
Every now and then this job throws up 'special' cases, where we get up close and personal with ill, dying or dead celebrities. But they are just human being, aren't they? What makes them different is our perspective of them. Nevertheless, it's still a huge testament to this profession that crews dealing with these individuals behave no differently than they would if it was your mother or brother. They might be a bit phased, or if they are a fan, a little shocked and grieved, but the actions are the same; the procedure is professional.

In case you didn't know, my Granny passed away last Saturday and it has been one of the hardest things I've had to deal with. I miss her so much. The world just doesn't seem right without her. My whole 33 years, she's been my constant and my the person I turn to in every situation. So, it's an adjustment. I know she is in a better place and she's with my Grandpa, where she's wanted to be since he passed away last August. I find peace and comfort in that. I really and truly appreciate each and every one of you who have left sweet comments on my Facebook page, Twitter, and sent emails. You girls are the best.
Not having all the necessary groceries was not going to stop me so I improvised a little and learned a lot in the process.
For the craft, I took a couple different ideas and put them together. I had tons of leftover plastic eggs from when we used to have a big Easter egg hunt. I bought large yellow pom poms (unfortunately I had to buy several assorted bags for this, but we’ll use them later.) Each kid had a pom pom, two google eyes, and a little foam triangle for a beak. They glued these on and while they dried, they decorated the eggs and a foam bowl with Easter stickers. They shredded green tissue paper and glued it into the bowl. Then they attached pipe cleaner handles to the foam bowls and ended up with an Easter basket. The pom pom chicks went into the plastic eggs and were placed in the basket. The end result: an Easter basket with an egg which, when opened, produces a cute baby chick! I wish I had pictures but I guess I forgot my camera that day, but the picture below is what the chicks looked like.
A while later, the prospect of my watching DRACULA AD 1972 provoked an earnest discussion, with my Dad agreeing to sit up and watch the film with me and my brother to make sure there was nothing too unsuitable. There wasn’t — a wrist-slitting black mass, lots of vampirism, a stake through the heart — but no nipples. So that’s OK.
It is enough when, startled, a murder of crows ascends to the sky – gathering like a torrid thundercloud seeking to release itself once again upon a verdant land. The beating of a hundred pairs of shiny black wings telegraphs a bolt of voltage clear down to my toes. Alarm clock be damned, if I need to rise, I have only to remember that flock of birds or the thrill of a giant manta gliding right toward me out of the blue. Seeded long enough in memory, these and a million other startling images prove adequate to awaken me from the deepest slumber.

First thing I set out each Christmas
On Friday morning, I was once again awakened at the witching hour....3:30 am....with contractions. This time they were about 15 minutes apart. An hour later, they were still going strong and getting closer together....yay! Could this be the big moment? Nana was on the books to take the older kids, but it was so early in the morning, I didn't want to call her yet, just in case it was another round of fakey contractions. Around 5:15 am, the contractions were 10 minutes apart so I woke up the hubby just to warn him and went back downstairs to watch some DVRed CSI. He didn't seem too concerned and at first rolled over for a "snooze button" worth of extra sleep. A few minutes later I heard him get up and brush his teeth and begin getting ready. Within the next few minutes, the contractions went from 10 minutes apart to four minutes. Uh oh, the lightening fast labor I was yearning for was kicking into high gear. After getting his morning breath worthy enough to go public, Johnny called down to me to see how things were going. I told him they were four minutes apart and it was "go time."

On Saturday we took our nephew, Seth, to Bucyrus, Ohio to the Elkhorn Lake Hunt Club to their Family Field Day. Each year on the 4th Saturday in September they put together a hands-on day for kids and adults to help introduce them to the outdoors and outdoor safety. We have been several times a volunteers for the archery range but this was the first time we have gone as actual participants. Basically you are broken up into groups and you spend 45 minutes at each station. The stations this year were archery, rifles, boating safety, fishing, shotguns, and making a turkey call. We even had Elk stew for lunch.....yum! Here are some pictures of our day.
A 2011 study by the USDA Economic Research Service estimated the costs of 153 commonly eaten fruits and vegetables, including fresh, canned, and frozen.

Just got back from LA and Vegas on an eight day tasting and drinking tour where we hit pretty much every restaurant of note in the limited time we had. Spurred on and informed by insiders of the foodie echelon of the highest level, we left no stone unturned. Coming from the best restaurant city in the world, we obviously had our critical antennae out , especially where it came to big name French chefs implanted in Vegas offering watered down versions, for the most part, of cooking we could eat at home at half the price. That being said, there were revelations.

Indians have no answer to these questions of new emerging regional formations in South Asia. They vainly hope Pakistan would implode, but China has already shored up Pakistan.

I started going through the guest room piles of old clothes yesterday. So many items to ebay this year. I am committed to not miss this selling season. I need to have all my auctions up by late July to not miss on the high fall/winter traffic (crazy, I know!). So I began washing and folding and taking inventory (95% is Gymboree- old lines= good $ to be had) and researching current selling prices. I think I have some possible big $$ items.

Most authors were avid readers as children, and I’m no exception. My reading habit began early, when my parents would tuck me in to bed with a pile of picture books. Nowadays I tuck myself in, but I still like to “settle my brains” with a good book. Here’s a baker’s dozen of favorites from childhood:
Oh another week and lots to do. There was one article that struck me and stayed with me since last week. It is entitled Ostracism Causes Lingering Pain in the Brain and written by Dr. Amen. As a survivor, I will admit that in the past I had an abnormal fear of this happening in my social settings. In the present, I just feel a lot of pain when this happens. At the same time, I have learned that if people do not want me in their lives, it is their loss and not mine. However, at the end of the day, the pain is still there. After reading this article, I understand why. As a survivor who is an adult, I am so glad more and more is coming out about this form of abuse. It is like my own feelings are finally being validated. Yes, they are real and yes, it is a serious problem.
The statement also said the driver is now in custody, and an investigation is underway.
Sourced from a low generation audience recording, the sound is very clear and extremely well-balanced, with every instrument, vocal, and sound effect perfectly audible, despite evidence the taper was slight distance from the stage. Musically, the set is complete and includes all the tune-ups, introductions, and hell, we’re even given an entire track of the audience prior to “Echoes!” There are brief cuts after “Raving And Drooling” and “You’ve Got To Be Crazy” but only a couple seconds of tuning are omitted in either case. The audience is attentive and appreciative throughout, with only an occasional side conversation audible during some of the softer bits - there is a good amount of distinctly British banter during the tune-ups but nothing too distracting during the actual performances.

Day-neutral plants form flower buds and produce fruit from spring through fall; day length is of no concern. These berries are usually planted as annuals. The fruit is smaller than typical of other varieties, but is of premium quality. Plants resist disease but do not grow or produce well in hot climates.
This is a direct assault on freedom of speech. That would be significant enough in itself, but this situation is only partly about Mr Wilders and his fate; it's actually about all of us, whatever our views or principles. Because the Dutch government is drawing its battle lines, and actually transmitting the message that they will ruin anyone who happens to disagree with them. They may be the first, but they won't be the last; this 'hate speech' legislation is now firmly entrenched in most Western countries.

When looking for herbs to start now, check local garden departments for plants, or start herbs from seed. Dill, basil, and oregano are good choices, but try to buy varieties that are compact such as Globe basil or Fernleaf dill. It should describe it as such on the packet.

Considering an important fact that server power consumption is dynamic we need to have a sophisticated way to measure actual power draw of a server based on the configuration and utilization. This is where DCIM tools play an important role. DCIM which is commonly known as Data center infrastructure management provides performance and utilization data for IT assets and physical infrastructure throughout the data center. The data collected at low-level infrastructure level aid domain experts (e.g., capacity planners and facilities planners), to conduct intelligent analysis. According to Gartner report “DCIM: Going Beyond IT” published in March 2010, DCIM tools are expected to grow to 60% in 2014 from 1% market penetration in 2010. DCIM doesn’t replace systems performance management or facilities management systems however it takes facets of each and apply them to data center infrastructures. It drives performance throughout the data center by monitoring and collection of low-level infrastructure data to enable intelligent analysis by IT capacity planners and facilities planners and thus enable holistic analysis of the overall infrastructure.

One of them, bold and brave James Alonzo Hines (61 yrs), took charge. He rammed his golf cart into the group of guys, and smashed them over the head with his club. He proceeded to demand that they respect their elders. Seriously. That’s not just something old people say in movies.
‘But you have to – it’s just, right, well, okay, it’s just about this one moment in time which changes the entire course of this love affair – and I know you’ll love it, because in that moment the woman…(and she rolled her eyes here) ‘…wait for it’ (shaked her head) ’…finds God’. I thought she was about to start sobbing at this point but she managed to contain herself and continue, ‘You’ll love it’.

2) Tell the story because you love it. There are two sides to this coin. You are going to RE-tell the story a zillion times if the book becomes popular, so you BETTER love it! Also, when I speak at schools, it never fails that a kid will ask "how much money do you make?" After their teacher turns every shade of red, I answer them honestly. "I'm very thankful my husband supports me so that I can be here with you today." I can make a living from writing, but it's increasingly difficult. My income was much better as a landscape designer. Unfortunately for my husband, I am not motivated by money either. And I think the advent of new technology has more people are writing, which probably makes my writing less valuable monetarily since there is a glut in the market. Yes, I might become the next JK Rowling. But that won't matter after I've won the lottery, which I actually have a better shot at doing.

Anyhoo. I took the week after Easter off as a holiday, since I had vacation time carried over from 2011 that I had to either use or lose by the end of April. I had lofty plans to use that week to get things done, yo – file my taxes, overhaul the apartment (clean out the closets, scrub every inch of the bathroom and go through the clutter under the sink, get rid of clothing I never wear, maybe even sew a shower curtain since I can’t find any I like in the stores and am currently making do with only a $1.49 clear liner from IKEA), write letters, and maybe go for a long drive across the prairie with a friend, her kids and our cameras. Instead, I came down with a cold over Easter weekend that rapidly turned into bronchitis, and spent most of the following week hidden behind mountains of wadded-up kleenex, alternately sleeping and coughing to and beyond the vomit point. Fun times. The apartment got a very quick once-over in the panicked half-hour between when I got home from shopping Friday afternoon and when my two guests arrived for drinks, and I’m glad that happened or it wouldn’t have gotten cleaned at all. Of course, “drinks” turned out to mean a few sips of wine, followed by the admission that we were all sickish, and subsequent switch to tea with lots of honey and lemon in it – because we’re exciting like that.

I just am unable to craft. All my free time is going away in doing bits of work for others at home (mostly shopping!!) for my BIL's engagement early next month. I was supposed to make some money envelopes for my MIL too but haven't had the time to get the right supplies :-(
But, the rest of us have to be committed to spending very little for the sake of a higher good (in this case -- maybe yours too -- so that you can be free to make your home and educate your children by providing a beautiful environment for them). To make things work, you have to be willing to look everywhere, and you have to tell everyone what you need!

We had a great few days in there. Favorites from this trip were Space Mountain, World of Color (C. loved it), getting soaking wet riding the Screamer in California Adventure 3 times in a row while it was pouring rain and no one else was in the park, meeting some of S's favorite people, hanging out with cousins on Pirate Island and eating churros.
This is my father when he was stationed in Singapore in the late 1940s. He joined the British Army in October, 1942. He enlisted as a “Boy Soldier” at the age of 151/2. The following letter that I discovered last week, leads me to believe that he was greatly influenced by that to which he refers.
What worries me more is that Wooden is African-American and the message he is sending out to young people of color is dangerous! We need to support and raise up our LGBT Black brothers and sisters! Shame on you, Pastor Wooden. How long before your boy toy jumps out of the closet?
It was a good lesson to help me realize that people are not defined by what others say, nor how they look, or your preconceived notions of them. I learned to take the time to get to know someone even if other people have bad things to say about them. How do you know that other people took the time to get to know someone before judging them? Maybe we should all take the time to see who a person really is before we judge them. I think a lot of people will find that instead of making enemies, they make friends. I know I am thankful for my best friend, and for the many years we have been able to lean on each other.

It wasn’t like the rest of the world had grown more sentient, more ecologically-friendly to the shark population in the intervening thirty years. The animal population had shrunk in direct contrast to the increasing human proliferation of the planet. But Tom was convinced that the shark in his school were probably the only ones left in the entire seven oceans with such a natural and unspoiled habitat. He intended to keep it that way.

“I still have many things to tell you, but you can’t handle them now. But when the Friend comes, the Spirit of the Truth, he will take you by the hand and guide you into all the truth there is. He won’t draw attention to himself, but will make sense out of what is about to happen and, indeed, out of all that I have done and said.” (John 16:1-15)
A borse, of course, was the primary beast of burden used by the Kertoobis, as the singular race who inhabited Lower Kertoob were known. It looked a little like a cow and a little like a pig and not an awful lot like a horse at all. However the most striking thing you would notice, if you should happen to see a borse for the first time, was that the two legs on the left were substantially shorter than the two legs on the right.
There are numerous mentions of live sacrifices in ancient Hinduism. The most valuable one was of course the human sacrifice, the purusha-medha. Whoever commissioned this and paid the Brahmin priests to perform it was said to be as divine as the Prajapati, a name for the Creator. The most common offering was the goat. The following excerpt from the Brahmanas as translated by Klaus Klostermaier explains: “When the devas had killed a man for their sacrifice, that part of him which was fit to be made an offering went out and entered a horse. Thence the horse became an animal fit to be sacrificed. From the horse it went into the ox, from there into the goat. In the goat it remained for the longest time, therefore the goat is best fitted for sacrifice.”
“I’m well aware. They couldn’t place you at the scene. They couldn’t place anyone. There was absolutely no sign of forced entry, no missing keys or keycards. The patrolling officer didn’t hear anything. The chemicals were found later in a storeroom. But the video is still there, plain as day. It either shows a young man, or a ghost walking into the lab and leaving with dangerous materials.”

I should explain here that the only reason I maintain a MySpace account is that it enables me – very occasionally – to link to person X or Y should the need arise when I’m in deep research mode for one of my various archival projects.

I’ll take this opportunity to diverge from the usual Take Three path, and, instead of focusing on one last role, offer up an Arkin Remix - a concisely-potted overview. Arkin has long been seen as one of the exemplary supporting actors. So many of his roles before his resurgence in popularity during the ‘90s and ‘00s, to present day, were memorable; it’s hard to single one last role out. He added charm and a studious commitment to characterising a range of films from his debut (That’s Me, in 1963) onwards.

now, onto the music. a few weeks ago, i grabbed lunch at a local dive bar downtown with tom. we were catching up after italy and talking business about a couple video projects i have on my plate. tom owns earthwork recording, and is a crazy talented musician, singer and songwriter…look him up. anyway. we were at lunch, getting grilled cheese on wheat as usual, and he told me his buddy kevin was coming. cool, whatever, i’m down. i’ve heard some of kevin’s music – thanks to tom – and i know he’s from granville and been out on the road a lot. that’s about all i know. oh, and his song guarded was featured on vampire dairies in february {mmhmmmm, right?!}.

The basic reason motors work is because electricity and magnetism are one and the same thing - electromagnetism. This stuff gets mathematically complicated: if there's one area that the vast majority of other engineers I've known hated in school, or had a wicked hard time with, it was electromagnetics. I'll leave out the math, but just know that an electric field creates a magnetic field, and likewise, that magnetic field will create another electric field.

Two sessions were recorded for John Peel, at the legendary BBC Maida Vale studios: a set in the Goat timeframe on February 24, 1991 with BBC producer (and former Mott the Hoople drummer) Dale Griffin, and one in the era of Liar on September 27, 1992 with BBC producer Nick Gomm.
If it sounds like music served more as a medium for political awakening, that would be because for Hanna and several others, the movement wasn’t about the music, the music was about the movement. Fanzines and group meetings in Olympia and D.C. (really in Arlington, VA at the Positive Force house) drew readers and participants. While Marcus acknowledges some girls came and soon left not quite connecting with the group, others stayed. These activities mattered just as much as Bikini Kill or Bratmobile songs. Like the early punk scene RG emulated, getting onstage and simply performing meant as much as the finished product.

What is interesting is how this is able to be justified. I mean I remember when I was young I used to work for my uncles and friends of the family doing labour stuff where they would basically get the young kids to “do the dirty work” Which is what you see in Fast Food places where there is a lot of young kids working there because they are able to afford working for cheap wages because they likely live at home, and this is somehow justified within the parameters that one must start out at the bottom and do the dirty work and work their way up. Because this is “how the world works” Where the entire employment structure is based on economic slavery. And no one seems to question it at all, but just assume that it is working or how it is supposed to be.

So this week, I encourage you to be mindful about seemingly good/uplifting content out there, whether it’s online or in magazines, that may subtly make you wonder if you’ve got an issue (that you probably don’t have). Even well-meaning writers can start their articles saying things like ‘most women feel xxx about their xxx’ or ‘in this economy, it’s not surprising if you feel xxx about your finances’ etc. And maybe before you read that article you felt fine, but now you’re like ‘oh god, maybe I do feel a bit xxx about my finances in this economy’ or ‘well, maybe I do feel a bit xxx about my xxx’. (that could be ‘I feel judgemental about my skin’)

She refused; he pushed.

There will be other difficulties involved in amateur bomb-making. In contrast with military or industrial explosive systems, in which explosive substances and components have properties and interactions which are known with precision, amateur bomb-builders will be dealing with self-devised systems in which a) the purity of chemical substances, b) the amounts and relative positions of explosive components, c) the interactions between primaries, secondaries, and tertiaries, and d) the reliability of detonation systems will have to be tested to ensure that one has produced a viable explosive system. Accordingly, experimentation will be required, and it will be obvious that this will have to take place in isolated areas if terrorist plotters are to avoid detection by the authorities. Muslims are not only overwhelmingly concentrated in urban areas, but, as we have noted, already stick out like a sore thumb in rural areas unless they happen to be white converts. This increases the importance of such locations as Pakistan and Somalia to Muslim terrorists. However, visiting such places to receive training presents its own problems, which range from being flagged by the Pakistani, British, or American security services to having one’s stay in the motherland cut short by a Hellfire missile. Moreover, the high failure rate of graduates of these camps in actually trying to build viable devices suggests that tuition therein is often not really up to scratch.

He, God Himself, was the only one who could provide the solution to humanity’s problem.

It's a little hard to tell, but what you're seeing is a delicious vanilla cake with a cinnamon-sugar swirl in the middle, encrusted with cinnamon-sugar! By dusting the pan with cinnamon-sugar and sprinkling a liberal dose over the top of the batter (which becomes the bottom of the cake), the whole outside caramelizes into an amazing sugary crunch. A great bonus for the person cutting the cake who gets to munch of some of the crunchy crumbs that break off. You can see the crust a little bit at the bottom right of the cake.

The piece (image ABOVE) I’m currently scribbling out (well, it is more than scribbling…more like the charcoal caressing the paper; much more special) has to do with the human emotions (the heart-specifically mine) and what happens to it when you’ve met a few insensitive jerks, basically. The heart gets metaphorically beaten up & yet it is still ticking. 50 monkeys don’t stop my show (although I haven’t had 50 romances…that would be very vulgar, huh?). Also, one develops a tough exterior and a heart of titanium to keep the heart from being penetrated as much. This toughness is represented by some objects in the drawing.

I love the fact that some artists are getting paid what they deserve and are renown worldwide, but this is the only side we seem to see on TV or online is this domination of wealth again substance.

It’s the ambivalence that’s the worst thing – the will to operate without the means to achieve. Somewhere, though, in that struggle, great things can happen. Ideas fuse with disparate thoughts in a way you otherwise can’t encourage, and the dimness of perception can create momentary, terrifying fantasy out of everyday objects. The befuddled trudge can, for short periods, coalesce into something interesting, even useful, if you enjoy being trapped in a netherworld between the real and imagined.

Looking back, I wonder if that’s where my desires to teach and control started. At the age of 5, I was being told to “teach” others which meant I had a certain “power” over them. It didn’t help when almost halfway through the year the teacher’s aide we had that did our language and spelling “classes” was arrested and we didn’t have anyone to grade our workbooks. My teacher said that since I knew how to read and had already completed my book on my own that I could grade the other students’ books. Yup, I “taught” language and spelling in Kindergarten. How cool is that?

Fortunately, it is still not forbidden to consider things, so the forbidden thought comes to me: why does this system not bear fruit among the 80% Muslim multiple offenders in Berlin?

Returning to her roots as a nightclub performer, Horne took part in the March on Washington in August 1963, and continued to work as a performer, both in nightclubs and on television, while releasing well-received record albums. She announced her retirement in March 1980, but the next year starred in a one-woman show, Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music, which ran for more than three hundred performances on Broadway and earned her numerous awards and accolades. She continued recording and performing sporadically into the 1990s, disappearing from the public eye in 2000.

It has been tough for the human population there for an extended period – imagine how the animals have fared. I applaud the efforts of Animal Works –see their website and blog. The dinner was fun and everyone loved Africa so much and shared a concern for it’s wildlife. Botswana was a favourite country to visit. The highlight for me was when I was signing a copy of our book and I asked a girl what name should I write in it – and she said “My name is Katania. My Dad just loved Christian’s story and named me Katania”

Also come that evening to hear artist Gloria Benedeto speak about her work at 6:20 or to find Bonnie Ferguson Butler doing a painting demonstration. And you will not want to miss artist Charla Wilkerson's fantastic and sometimes whimsical drawings and paintings. Her work is featured this month in the front of the W-16 gallery and you can also read an interview of Ms. Wilkerson in the local Patch.
This can be applied to most areas of your life. In love and relationships you have a comfort zone and if you creep outside of it you will either scramble or de-compensate. Depending on what your personal comfort zone is, your reaction to people in relationships will be controlled by where you feel safest. Although, where you feel safe may not be the healthiest place to be.

The article calls this “pre-crime detection” similar to that in Tom Cruise’s movie Minority Report, and labels it a “super creepy invasion of privacy” and of “little to no marginal security” benefit.
I cleared the sidewalk salt off the front hallway floors, took the sheets from the beds in the guest rooms, got the holiday serving platters ready to pack and downloaded the pics from the camera and put them in their folders......gonna go clean off the table in the workroom and get to some of those scanning projects I've been meaning to get to.

And yet even I could feel a small frisson of excitement as I stood on the top deck of the P&O Pacific Pearl as she set sail with an ear-piercing horn that blasted for at least a minute. There are worse ways to spend a Wednesday afternoon, I said to Minh, as we waved to the bridge climbers on top of the Sydney Harbour Bridge and chugged past the sails of the Sydney Opera House.

You can also mulch under trees and plants in your actual beds! Using hay or actual “mulch,” aka dried pine needles, cover the ground beneath your little baby trees a foot or two out from the trunk. Pile the stuff up til it’s really thick. This will keep moisture and nutrients in the tree’s roots. Putting large stones around a tree trunk or raising the soil to build a little circular wall will also do this to some extent. Mulch in your garden beds for the same purpose. Just make sure your plants there are big enough so as not to get suffocated!
Tell us about a time you had expectations for a date or relationship and it didn’t go the way you wanted.
Although the Marian executions should never count as a less-than-dreadful series of events, Duffy’s research should caution readers against one assumption: Namely, it is extremely difficult to determine the motives of men and women in the past, especially in relation to such terrible deeds. Historians should not presume that Marian bishops and magistrates were bloodthirsty or sadistic, whatever wrong-headed rationale they may have used to support the burning of English evangelicals.
The look on this necklace is economic but the intention was to showcase the white stringing wire by Beadalon - that is one of my favorites ever...of course Swarovski Elements add glamour all over it and the carved bone flower pendants bring enough Spring mood for the year round.

As in the second study above, the correlation between moralism and having actually demonstrated was again non-significant but negative in sign (r = -.088). When the subjects were divided into the two groups of thirty demonstrators and eighty-seven non-demonstrators, the means of the non-demonstrators were again slightly (but non-significantly) higher on the moralism scale -- 75.19 (12.03) versus 72.76 (15.40). The scores on the Social Desirability scale were 24.87 (4.83) for the non-demonstrators and 23.86 (5.40) for the demonstrators.

Arthur Koestler described the Balfour Declaration as a letter in which "one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third." Many people believe that the territory was part of a deal in which the Rothschilds, in return, used their influence to bring the United States into the Great War, though of course that is conjecture.
The marketing-speak in play here is truly awesome. Prado isn’t just a Richmond condo across the street for Lansdowne Centre, it’s modeled on perfection. In short, it’s an embodiment of excellence sure to invoke envy of the highest order. Obviously there’s no way the developer can live up this “commitment” in any plausible sense. It is so vague as to be meaningless, yet it exists for all to consider.

I took my paper square with the hole in the middle and laid it onto the X on the center of my mirror, I then positioned my square on top of it until it was lined up and then removed the paper. I then began measuring all of the distances I had remaining and centered the next two squares in the same way.
SO......bottom line.....I would not hesitate to use the Lapel Stick when working with bigger pieces and where I didn't need the glue to be colored when it's first applied and I would carry it in my purse for emergency fixes. I will, however, stick with the glue pen for smaller pieces and wherever the "colored" glue is important to me when first applied. If any of you are interested in trying the Lapel Stick, I will send out a couple of tubes to someone whose name I draw on Sunday night. I thank the manufacturers for giving me an opportunity to try this and to share some with one of my blog readers and appreciate that I was allowed to give an honest review of it here, also.
What a refreshing change from the D.I.Y. days of old.
Get your ends trimmed every two months. Getting your ends trimmed should not be a new concept for us. With relaxed hair, we typically get our ends trimmed every six to eight weeks (when we get our touch-up). Continue to do this. Your hair grows an average of half inch per month. Therefore, for every one inch of new growth at your roots, get that very same amount removed from your ends (about every two months). Continue to get your ends trimmed every two months until you have completely removed all of your relaxed hair (unless you decide to do the ‘big chop’ and cut off all of your relaxed hair at once).

In the market carnage, Greek stocks fell to two-decade lows, and Spanish bond yields leapt to levels not seen since the panic of last November. Shares of a big Spanish lender dropped 8.9% on the Madrid bourse, pulling the benchmark index down 2.7%. The Italian market also fell 2.7%, and the euro slid to $1.2845 late Monday in London, its lowest level in four months.

If you are planting a garden with a wide variety of plants about a 6 on the PH level will be in range for just about everything, it will be on the high side for things like your sweet potatoes and eggplant and it will be on the low side for several others, but it is within all of their good growing levels. as far as growing fruit trees they like 6.5-8 for their PH levels. berries will like to be down 5.5 to 6, and your lawn likes 7.5.

This is precisely what Chris Hedges points out in the debate in asserting that the power of protest movements is in their powerlessness. Kids with rocks against tanks is essentially non-violent protest, since there’s no chance of the rocks killing anyone. Any protest movement can only succeed by getting people–especially people inside the power structure–off the sidelines and supporting the movement.
The other day I caught Toddlers in Tiaras (a disgusting show where mothers, who have failed to make something of themselves, live out weird fantasies of wealth and beauty by forcing their little girls to traipse around in wigs and makeup applied with a trowel.) It was an episode that garnered a lot of controversy because a mother put her 4-year-old in a costume with padded breasts and butt. Frankly, it surprised me that anyone got upset considering the other outrageous things they do to these girls all the time like forcing them to wear false teeth and look like cheap streetwalkers.

But that doesn’t explain why fat people get teased, bullied or ridiculed so much as if they don’t have feelings. Like they aren’t real human beings.
I’m not really a science fiction reader. I really like reading dystopian books, but sometimes I fear that they’ll lose me with too much science. Initially, I feared reading this book, mainly because it wasn’t like all the other dystopians out there. The story is about Amy, who is cryogenically frozen aboard the Godspeed, destined to begin her life on a new planet — 300 years in the future. But before she reaches the planet, her capsule is opened and she discovers a new life aboard the Godspeed, where nothing seems to make sense.
Fotouh refers to Israel as a "a racist state with 200 nuclear warheads" that constitutes Egypt's main security threat. For that matter, he calls the U.S. assassination of Osama bin-Laden "state terrorism' and that bin-Laden was not a terrorist - that was just invented by America to "hit Muslim interests."
I accompanied them to see the boys' other grandmother, who lives in Birmingham and also to Sidmouth to see the other grandfather. It was good to be able to go further afield as it is some time since I managed to get out that far. I really enjoyed the change of scenery.
Then in 2009 they posted a single season league record of 99 points with 31 wins (3 points in the standings for a win), 6 draws (1 point for a draw), and a single loss. Most importantly, they defeated their Castilian rivals Real Madrid both times they faced them in their twice-annual match which is called el clasico.

Well, they all gone now? Good.

There’s a lot of lively discussion of the riders and teams, from Ned’s perspective as a reporter and (sometimes) as a fan. His portrayal of the Vacansoleil team, with their maverick, aggressive approach to the race, is tied into a vision of ‘real’ Vacansoleil holidays:

I am One Who Serves, Ascended Master in the order of the seven rays, and I wish to speak briefly of the ego self which in many ways does not want to let go, it is holding on for its very existence trying to maintain the status quo, but it is only doing what it is supposed to do. There is nothing negative for it is only following its purpose, but soon that purpose will be changed, soon the ego will be needed no longer in the respect it has been needed. It will no longer be needed to help the consciousness learn right from wrong, light from dark and the rest of duality. Even the dark Cabal has had its purpose in a three dimensional understanding, but that is no longer needed, why it is being lifted now.

For all the potential that the concept of crowdsourcing brings to online news gathering, there remains one unavoidable fact that has so far kept it from enhancing hyperlocal sites such as Silver Spring Patch: it requires a crowd. Absent a large number of engaged participants, it remains a concept rather than a tangible asset.

We grew apart... I became a crazy radical, and she remained devout and conservative. We had little in common as adults, and it was somewhat uncomfortable. You know how that is.
If there is one step back in this movie, it would be the plot of the movie. Like the first movie the villain is kind of in the background, which does take some of the steam out of the movie at points. Thankfully it’s propped up by likable characters, and at least a bit more attention given to the villain DT (Brian Tee), which does mean you feel some of the tension in the final act. Plot wise it’s not a strong movie, but it just seems more accomplished than previous entries, so with any weaknesses it’s easier to bypass them and enjoy the movie.
Two decades ago, when the Public House first opened, the beer list was composed almost entirely of bottled imports, mostly from Europe, with only a handful of American-made “micros” even available. The beer list that made our reputation grew from this fact, and it made us famous.

Not having gone to anything like this before (and not knowing anyone there) I was looking forward to it but didn't really know what to expect! It was advertised as a one day festival celebrating the earth and contemplative spirituality in the Jesus tradition. I admit I didn't really know what that was going to mean - I suppose also it means I went open minded and with no preconceived ideas either. Sometimes that's a good thing.

And I knew that, when I sent it off, given her increasingly frazzled notes in the last two months. So I took the last days of the previous week and the weekend to leave the draft completely, to prepare myself: laundry, yard cleanup. I can't edit well when I'm surrounded by clutter.

The Pentagon is about ten miles from the global headquarters of RW Enterprises, LLC. Going south from Roxie's World, it's the first clear sign that a trip is underway, as the federal city and its monuments fade from view. Coming north, it means, Hooray, we're nearly home! One part of our household's 9/11 narrative that didn't make it into the 2008 post is that, on the weekend after the attacks, the Moms felt moved to get in the car and drive down to see the damaged building. It felt necessary and appropriate to do so. They are hardly fans of the military-industrial complex, though Moose has always admitted that in the aftermath of the attacks she took comfort in the sounds of fighter jets constantly passing over the house. In any case, they needed to see for themselves the appalling gash in the massive building, smell the smoke from the barely extinguished fires. They were hardly alone in that impulse. The highway was packed with vehicles that slowed to a crawl as they approached the Pentagon.

The energy helps to purify, cleanse and detoxify the body and mind. As the energy works through the energy blockages it can cause toxins to be released that are stored in the area. Some people may feel achy or tired at times leading up to the session. This is good and very, very helpful in the healing process. Tiredness is a sign that the body is using most of it's energy for healing. Many modalities recognize the positive effects from detoxification. You may also find that you have to go to the bathroom more as you release toxins. During the purification process your organs of elimination will be energetically supported to help them release the toxins. I have done this process with thousands of people and the energy always works for people's highest good. If you don't feel good some of the time, try and hold the thought that you are healing.

Unfortunately, the Western media has fallen for this very obvious ploy hook, line and sinker. When Israel reacts, it becomes worldwide news, but there is little mention of the deaths of the inhabitants of Sderot, nor of the horrifying statistic that 90% of Sderot’s children require psychiatric counselling in an attempt to undo the damage that no child should ever have been subjected to.
I've been trying to create social media "buzz" around the business the best I can manage, and, in addition to the Twitter account and the blog, part of that effort includes updating the business' Facebook page.

Its comparisons of monthly salaries between day-laborers in developing nations, the President of the United States, and Prince Charles were also illuminating and sobering (and enough to make you want to take a polo mallet to all those commemorative plates for Will and Kate's Royal Wedding).

The only story I received from the director was Kristen cut off 3 inches of another girl's hair but it was hardly noticeable because the girl has layers and lots of hair. Well, that did not make me feel much better but what could I do. Kristen and I left, and I did not say a word the whole way home. I just drove trying to not break down crying too much. I did not know what to think. I was so angry.
Total Depravity:
There is no controversy when scholars examine the historicity of Jesus. Biblical archaeologists work freely, with no danger to their persons or their careers. Even if some literalist Christians find the scholarly conclusions distressing, no death threats are issued. Christianity has survived all critiques of its origins, relying on the strength of its message and not the provability of historical details. One would hope that Islam reacts similarly.
Recently, I have been experiencing nostalgia for my mother's garden. When I was a child I envisioned the secret life of every creature around me, real and imaginary. I suspected they were up to something special when humans weren't around.
Nationalism loses so many, myself included, I quickly realised that its game was not the peoples defence but power and power alone, that ego ran rampant and self required a kingdom, like others I moved away from the bickering, the nonsensical clash of fool against fool and I sought a kind of peace. Still nationalist I but beholden to no-one, no-one that is but for the people and my children, let them play, let them play buffoon ,they aid no-one and hold back any and all defence ,which is the peoples right.

Trees grow on both sides of the three-lane road looking more like a green excuse amidst the sea of concrete office developments around them than natural pieces of this urban jigsaw puzzle. The invisible hand leads me down Duke's Road (off Euston Road) and on to Flaxman Terrace to one of London's temples of dance: The Place, where I'm scheduled to teach a six-week Afro-Cuban dance workshop. Nearby is the Cathedral of Words: The British Library. One has students pirouetting in front of mirrors; the other metaphores and similes dancing off the written pages. In between them both runs Euston Road, on whose surface sheep and cattle traders once walked on their way to the market.
I’m here this week with two other terrific instructors whom I’ve worked with previously and we are working with folks from various regions and communities throughout the state to help them to become, or be better, CERT instructors. Fortunately for us (or perhaps unfortunately for us) many of the students in class have a strong instructional background. That’s good in that they’ll have lots of experience to draw on during class. However, from our vantage point (that of an instructor), teaching to your peers is always the most challenging. But, I can say we are up for the challenge and look forward to the discussions we will share over the next several days.
Throughout the Old Testament story, God reveals that Redemption is coming. The conflict between God and his creation is going to be resolved, peace will be restored, intimacy between Creator and Created will be renewed. The Redemption foreshadowed through Israel and the covenants is ultimately fulfilled through Christ. Through Jesus’ sinless life, death, resurrection, and ascension our sin has been paid for and cancelled.

The timing of our trip to the states was due in large part to the wedding of my very good college friend. It definitely gave me lots of ideas for my own, though not all of them are really possible in France. Well, anything is possible, maybe "widely practiced and accepted" is a better term.
In the eyes of the World any revengeful acts against white South Africans are warranted, because of what they had "supposedly" done to the blacks during Apartheid.
Many of Emily Bronte’s poems were written for the fictional world of Gondal, an island that Emily and Anne invented and wrote stories and poems about from children to adults. Sadly, none of the Gondal stories have survived, but Fannie Ratchford has a section in this book where she tries to put together as much about this world has she can using their poems, a short journal fragment, and letters exchanged between Emily and Anne. Ratchford has an outline of the reconstructed epic of Gondal and gives a brief description that makes the heading of the poems make more sense.

I covered over the last few days how the medium-term plans of the MerkeSchauble are now steadily more apparent, but although their approach is fundamentally anti-democratic, this is nothing new in the EU. And again, the German people, judiciary and many bankers have grave doubts about what the duo are up to. We are not witnessing a million upraised arms beneath the Siegessäule as Angolf Merkler salutes from an open car: this is a dash (ill-conceived, but with good intentions from their viewpoint) to make the EU safe from the ravages of international speculation.
Far be it for me to bitch about nudity, but there is far too much of it in Santa Claws. Wayne's boring obsession is punctuated with scenes in which Raven's husband shoots naked photographs of various women. I resented these scenes because it made Santa Claws last even longer. It's not proper nudity either, just the softcore stuff that you can find if you look hard enough on Dailymotion or whatever. Not that I would know anything about that.
This year, I have ordered two 10x30 party tents with sides. I plan to combine the two tents to make one large 20x30 tent where folks can get warm, or stay inside out of the chill. All the food and tables will be set up under the tents and I'll have the tent heated, if needed. This will give my guests the opportunity to move back and forth between the bonfire area and tent area, just in case it is cold or raining, this year. Keeping my fingers crossed that it will be a mild Autumn night with no wind or rain.

9. Don’t play coy or stupid or helpless to get attention. Don’t pretend something is too heavy so that a boy will carry it for you. Don’t play dumb to stroke someone’s ego. Don’t bat your eyelashes in exchange for attention and expect to be taken seriously, ever. You can’t have it both ways. Either you show the world that you have a brain and passions and skills, or you don’t. There are no damsels in distress managing corporations, running countries, or managing households. The minute you start batting eyelashes, eyelashes is all you’ve got.
And it is responsible for Jun-baiting an entire generation of Arashi fans. That is my story. I watched this, saw the name Arashi on MatsuJun’s profile and the rest is history.

Sec­ondly, some will reply that it was not “Moses’ Law”, but “God’s Law” established at Sinai — and how dare we set aside that which God has established. Well, may I point out it was also not “Aaron’s priesthood”, but “God’s priesthood” established at Sinai. If the fact that God authored the Mosaic law argues for its perpetuation, why doesn’t the same principle hold true for the priesthood He like­wise authored?

These are goals that are attainable, that you believe are attainable, so you can make progress toward them, so that you’re content with what you have but also seeing something growing from that.

For my Challenge Card today I chose to use the Bugaboo Brat Sean, I think he is so cute holding that flower behind him!!! I didn't want the card to be too girly with a boy stamp. But as I was coloring Sean I was reminded of a little boy named AJ I was a Nanny for for 6 1/2 years (I miss him SO MUCH!!! :( ) AJ new I loved flowers, and he would pick them and draw them for me. With that in mind, I didn't think this was too much....even if it was coming from a little boy.

I did give that seeker some tools to reckon with. At the same time, I urged him to absorb and practice a broad array of tools from the Teaching, most specially those regarding deprogramming of vices and the use of meditation. To my shock, the seeker was adamant in using them, which made me realize how deeply he was being controlled by the demonic Felines.

During my journey, I questioned why I didn't stay at home. I have quite a few books there already that I have been meaning to read and the weather was miserable to say the least. I thought that the universe had been trying to send me a message and that apparently wasn't the case. I looked around for a short cut that would get me to the library ASAP and back home in record time. There was an empty lot to my left with what appeared to be a barricade separating me from the quickest way to my targeted location. Was there a way around it? I wasn't sure and at that point if I had to climb over it or dig under it, I wasn't going to let a fence stop me.

She is an example of someone who decided to follow her passion for chocolate and started her own business in 1983. She wanted to change the very snobby atmosphere of chocolatiers by creating a more inviting and welcoming chocolate paradise. In 2007, she had the unique opportunity to buy one of the chocolate farms in Grenada that had been providing her with chocolate. They have since set up a joint venture that ensures that the grower gets fair prices for their chocolates. She has used this chocolate to develop her Rococo Organic House Blend.
What started out as a simple case of Athlete’s Foot (in me, not the dog – no athletics required) decided to blow itself up (almost literally) into something much worse.

How often have you needed a reference of someone of repute? It could have been concerning an application for a job. It could have been as a witness in court or concerning a dispute with a neighbour. It could even have been when called before the Headmaster in school. Whatever the cause, it was useful to have someone who could testify in your behalf.
The problem that he and his colleagues identified was that, although these "mega-ships" are normally stable, they have a crucial design flaw. Even a small amount of water breaking in after a collision may be forced across the ship, rendering it liable to capsize, exactly as happened to the Costa Concordia.
The majority of embedded communication systems can be classified as either point-to-point networks (data links) or shared media networks (data highways). It is important to understand the trade-off between these two types of systems. In point-to-point networks, each node of the system is connected to every other node. These systems are simple and reliable. Reliability is high since correct transmission between two nodes only depends on a single transmitter and receiver. Since each link is dedicated to communication between two nodes, it is easy to meet real-time deadlines without any sophisticated scheduling mechanism. In shared media systems all nodes are connected together using a ring or bus topology. The primary motivation for shared media is the reduction in wiring (and thus cost). These networks are easily extendable without adding any new data ports to individual nodes. Limited new cabling is required.
Today was an easy run, which unfortunately was interrupted by a vicious bowel movement, the 5th of the morning! At the half mile mark, there was a rumbling in my stomach and a quick trip to the restroom, and back to finish the other 2 miles. The effect of yesterdays leg workout was felt during this run as well. By the end of it, I was exhausted! Tomorrow will be an off day!!

But secondly and in many ways more significantly is the fact that fandom on the whole never wanted definitive explanations of these things. Yes, of course they complained constantly about the errors, but it fundamentally misunderstands the desires of fandom to assume that just because they’re complaining about something they want it fixed. In fact the reason for pointing out something like “what are those faces in The Brain of Morbius” or “what’s with that Planet 14 reference in The Invasion” is the fun of debating and proposing answers for the questions. The last thing anyone kvetching about Planet 14 wants is for some blowhard with a magazine column to offer some half-cocked “definitive answer,” doubly so if the “definitive answer” is rubbish anyway. Fans don’t want answers. They want things to argue about.
The Practical Cooks Junior rolled their eyes at my request to taste test this new peanut butter, and then proceeded to eat double their usual waffle allotment and most of my Honeycrisp apple with the Valencia Creamy as a dip.

Chinese New Year starts with the new moon of the first day of the new year and ends on the full mon 15 days later. The 15th day of the new year is called the Lantern Festival, which is celebrated with wonderful lantern displays. Lanterns are the main characteristic of the Chinese New Year and lit up the cities with a bright red color which brings warmth and joy to the heart. Experiencing Chinese New Year in Beijing was definitely one of the most beautiful moments in my life. It was said that the year of the rabbit was going to be a placid and very welcomed year, especially after the fierceful year of the Tiger and anticipating the even more aggressive year of the Dragon, the year we are in now, however the New Year celebrations last year seemed to be all but placid!

However, rescuing a poor monk was not nearly enough heroism for one day for such stalwart souls and they were hungry for more. When I told them that the village of Red Falls could be in danger from the villains, and the Yasuki reported that his father, the caravan master, had been kidnapped, they immediately set out to defeat all the bandits. There was a minor setback while some of us were set on fire, but that is only because the noble Matsu seemed to relish living life to the fullest at all times. Inspired by their bravery, I eagerly accompanied your men.

So (today) they (Muslims) are leading a life of the one who knows not any Prophet, nor believes in any Divine Message or Divine Inspiration, nor expects any reckoning nor is afraid of the Hereafter. They (Muslims) resemble the preIslamic ignorant nations, against whom they used to fight in the past. They have turned on their heels (back) as apostates from Islam, they have imitated them (ignorant nations) in their civilization, in their social affairs, in their political affairs, in their character and in the pleasures of their lives. They (Muslims) also imitated them in many other things because of which Allah (swt) hated and forsook them. He (Allah) put them (Muslims) into trials under the effects of (1) Western civilization (2) and the Eastern Communist propaganda. So their land became “a free wealth” with no protector, their kingdom became a victim for every beast of prey and a food (nourishment) for every eater, and the meaning of the statement of the Prophet (Muhammad pbuh ) became apparent:

2006’s Happy Feet wasn’t a great movie by any means, but for all its cute dancing penguins what lingers in the memory is what an eccentric vision Miller placed on screen, especially by family-movie standards. Unfortunately, genuine eccentricity in cinema is hard to pull off in a way that’s charming rather than annoyingly precious, and doubly so when a filmmaker must re-create his original formula. The biggest problem with Happy Feet is how what was once endearingly off-kilter now feels focus-grouped to death. Oh sure, all the hallmarks of the original- cute penguins singing and dancing along with popular songs, impressive computer animation, zany supporting characters- are there, but now it feels like Miller and company said, “hey, that was fun the first time, so why not double it up in the sequel?” So (to cite the most egregious example) instead of just getting Robin Williams to mince around in two roles- which, I mean, ugh- you’ve also got Hank Azaria with a Swedish-chef accent and Brad Pitt and Matt Damon as a pair of krill who oh-so-wackily venture off on their own. Couple that with a story that lopes along (remember Jason Mewes’ description of Lord of the Rings in Clerks II? That’s what this feels like), and Happy Feet Two ends up being perhaps the slowest 90-odd minutes I’ve spent in a theatre all year. Until it rallies somewhat in the final real with a production number set to “Under Pressure,” there’s nothing in this movie that provides any evidence that anybody involved actually cared about making this unique and special. It’s clear that Warner Brothers knew what they had on their hands, what with opening it opposite the new Twilight movie and all.

The peak of Jaime's recent output can especially be found in a pair of books collecting his final contributions to Love and Rockets Vol. II. Ghost of Hoppers is one of his best standalone works, focusing on Maggie as she reappraises her life following a divorce. This book is infused with elements of horror and fantasy, but its emphasis is on this 30-something's nostalgia for a home she no longer feels any connection to. As she revisits the sites of her past, scenes from her punk glory days poignantly weave together with the vision of her as an older, chubbier, tired woman. As with all of Jaime's recent work, it draws much of its power from the rich history of this character, but at the same time the polished beauty of his cartooning, and his efficient storytelling, prevent this book from being one for the hardcore fans only. The same is true of the follow-up volume The Education of Hopey Glass, which turns to the artist's other central character, a wild girl who's realizing that, without even meaning to, she's taken the first few steps towards maturity. Jaime's storytelling, his sheer drawing chops, and his obvious love for these complex characters, make these books some of the most moving works in all of comics. There is no greater all-around artist in modern comics than Jaime Hernandez, and his recent work builds on his past successes so that his oeuvre as a whole is shaping up to be one of literature's best sustained stories about aging and the shifting of relationships over the course of a life. I will gladly follow Maggie and Hopey and the rest of these people wherever Jaime chooses to take them. [buy] | [buy]

Pretty cool!!! I created my own backgrounds on these layouts using sand photo's and adjusting the 'opacity'! COOL huh??
time as his novel “Carrie”, in 1971, but the book took too much research and he wasn’t ready for something that time consuming. In an open letter from Stephen King in a magazine, he explains his idea as a possible comic with the story unfolding like this: “I’d like to tell a time-travel story where this guy finds a diner that connects to 1958, where you always go back to the same day. So one day he goes back and just stays. He leaves his 2007 life behind. His goal is to get up to November 22, 1963, and stop Lee Harvey Oswald. He does, and he’s convinced he’s just FIXED THE WORLD. But when he goes back to 2007, the world’s a nuclear slag-heap. Not good to fool with Father Time. So then he has to go back again and stop himself, only he’s taken on a fatal dose of radiation, so it’s a race against time.”
South Street's changing fortunes may have prevented a widespread problem of the sort which occurred in the 19th century. The old pubs and grog houses were closed or turned to speakeasies, and heavy shipping had moved on to other ports throughout the harbor, on the Hudson River side, and in Brooklyn and New Jersey. The ports themselves were heavily controlled by mob bosses -- and the promise of mob money -- which perhaps made such forced recruitment unnecessary. And of course the success of illegal Prohibition industries relied on knowing which laws to abide and which to skirt.

After the first two films, split apart by a handful of themed trailers, was Movie #3. Dan of Exhumed Films in his status updates had warned us of this film, and from the first shot, it proved to be worth the hype. The film was the very obscure The Face with Two Left Feet, described as Travolta-sploitation. Yes, it was that weird. In this Italian film, a character who looks EXACTLY like John Travolta is convinced by his friends to imitate the actor in order to get the girl. I was hesitant to mention this film, because if you try to look it up on the Internet Movie Database or Google or any other all-knowing search engine, you won’t find it. My fiance and I spent most of tonight trying. Some of you detractors may doubt the films existence because of its lack presence across the web, but I assure you, it’s real and it’s spectacular. Probably the most batshit movie I’ve ever seen, hands down.

Now while the whole concept makes my husband a little uneasy, it is that one bit that truly terrifies him. We all know ‘the bit’. ‘That bit’ makes him squeal like a small child. ‘That bit’ it is often used as a measuring scale in our little family to determine how scary something actually is. In testament to how enduringly terrifying ‘that bit’ is to him, we had never actually watched it together until just a few months ago, we hadn’t particularly not watched it because he was scared of it, but rather because he was frightened that ‘that bit’ would let him down and not be nearly as scary as his childhood self remembered it. Turns out he needn’t have worried, girlish shrieks still rang about our house at the moment in question and there was a moment after where he did momentarily debate having be accompany him to the bathroom, just in case.

"And the reason is all in education," Bloomberg continued. "If you look, other countries are starting to have great schools, great universities, great public schools. And they are becoming much more productive at a much greater rate than we are doing in America. We stopped improving our productivity 20-30 years ago, and the education system started going downhill, and certainly not growing and improving as fast as the rest of the world. And that's really what you see out there, and it's a great challenge, and the answer is to go back to the basics, education, and in the meantime getting people the experience they need, and working."

This pericope is a narrative account of Israel’s defeat under Joshua of an alliance of five Amorite kings who had attacked Gibeon – Israel’s new vassal city. The plot is moved forward by the communication of five messages: (1) King Adoni-zedek’s hearing of Joshua’s great victories over Jericho and Ai and Gibeon’s peace treaty with Israel, (2) the king’s message to four allied Amorite kings ordering an attack on Gibeon, (3) the Gibeonites’ plea to Joshua for help, (4) Yahweh’s words of affirmation and assurance of victory to Joshua, and (5) Joshua’s poetic speech to Yahweh. The story is introduced by King Adoni-zedek’s fear of Gibeon and its alliance with Israel. The action escalates as the Amorite alliance gathers and attacks Gibeon. The main conflict arrives with the Gibeonites’ desperate cry to Joshua for help and rescue. The narrative climaxes when Joshua responds with boldness and immediacy and sets out to defend Gibeon with Yahweh’s encouragement and promise of victory. The action is subdued as the Amorites come to their expected end – utter defeat and destruction at the hands of Israel and Yahweh. However, just as the story comes to an end, the narrator surprises the reader with an incredible detail: Yahweh heard Joshua’s request to the sun and moon and obeyed his direction. The reader is left with a sense of awe as Joshua returns to the Israelite camp at Gilgal.
The journey in search of the gold keeps the tale moving along at a steady pace, punctuated by colourful encounters – some benign, some mysterious, some dangerous – with fellow-travellers and local residents. All the main plot threads are resolved by the end, although there is still scope for interpretation of some of them, such as the significance of the Hecate figurine.

We all play with many different people. We’re studio musicians who do recording sessions. We play with bands that we don’t write for. We do different tours. Max studied for many years in India and Senegal. Moto has performed with Joe Lavano and Dave Weckl. I toured all over the world with numerous projects, including Cirque du Soleil’s Varekai for a year in a half. House of Waters is the group that we all write for collaboratively.
Consider the poor; give attention to them; study their necessities; wisely consult as to the best mode of alleviating them. Think not that attention is wasted when given to the poor, even if some important commercial speculation has to wait. What the word of God says in general, the providence of God says in particular, “Consider the poor,” says the former; ” consider this poor man,” says the latter. Indiscriminate charity is not the thing here commended. The vocation of a Christian is to be a benefactor; and this being his vocation he is not to grudge any pains that may be required in order to ascertain who are the really needy, and what the most effectual way of relieving them.

Finally, there's the tremendous thrill of doing something that could make you unemployed, beaten up, sued and shunned by society at any moment. As I tenderly hang out the back of Abbott's wife and bang her like a pissed-up sailor on shore leave, or fondly fist her until she punches me across the face and neck in a mixture of rapture and agony - all those intimate acts between two people in love are given an extra dimension. They're made, I don't know, a bit naughty. Which is amazing when you consider how tender and loving the acts themselves are. Burp.

And as most of us know, Jack loved his Legos. Jack’s passion for Legos was bigger than life – they were not just a toy to him, but a creative element and a very likely future career. Even when he was very young, he built complicated sets that would challenge adults. My kids and I always thought that Jack would become an engineer or an architect. He was curious, careful, methodical, and tenacious in his studies and his relationships.

I have decided to participate in the photo a day challenge for April. Each week I will post the six pictures for that week and on the last week I will link up all the previous weeks. I'm also working on my photography skills so these pictures are all taken with the semi manual settings (I'm not ready for full manual yet).
I was then escorted to the car and given a list of things I should and should not do and was on my way. Hopefully if you have to undergo this procedure, you’ll have as wonderful a team of nurses and doctor as I did.
Aww, another coincidence. Want to bet Buford told the story to higher ups in the campaign, and they held it, releasing it to a friendly 'journalist' at just the right moment and then engineering the subsequent drive by their media lackeys?
I wonder if it was possible to change the future, would I do it? Rewrite history and all that? I'm not sure really? We learn so much from sorting out our own clutter and warped experiences, don't we?
I could never imagine anyone so perfect as the love I have right now. Jimmy holds all the answers, and when he doesn’t, he will hold my hand while I look for them. He’s patient and understanding and calm. He is the Yin to my Yang. Opposing & symbiotic at the same time, centred and joyous.
The tribal patterns of McQueen's dress appear wild and sexy, which gets even reinforced by the simple black H&M leather jacket (I'm sure this material will look absolutely cheap in real life but thanks to this polywhore EVERYTHING looks amazing). Generally, I never go for some bootees in combination to a dress (especially not to a night out dress) but these ones looked simply gorgeous.

I see an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living. I see children even more successful than their parents – some successful even beyond their wildest dreams – and others congratulating them for their achievement, not attacking them for it.
I’ve stated this before and I’ll state it again. The Shining is my favorite horror movie of all time. It is a movie I return to again and again. Something that I could discuss and dissect for hours, like any Kubrick film. This is a film with many moments that pop into your head, the little twin girls, the lady in the bathtub, the bear/wolf dude.

"The ensuing period of my homelessness in 1969 was one of the most rewarding of my life. I was continually thrown on the mercies and generosities of tender maidens. Oh those lovely situations. It was quite awful in one way – but quite beautiful in another."
And so came the revolutions to throw down the obstructions standing in the way of progress. The primary target of these rebels was Monarchy.
Try these on for size — “healthy” fish dishes offered by popular mass-market restaurants. Their calorie counts, and fat content, make them a bad joke. Eating what appear to be healthy foods is like tap-dancing through a minefield, especially in a restaurant where you have no idea what’s really in your meal.

After that, the crowd started leaving which made me realize that TSOOL was probably the highlight and the most-anticipated band on The Record Store Day in Bengans. But the day was not over yet. Aleks, the soulful RnB singer and rapper from Fruängen suburb in Stockholm, had to have also the chance to show his talent. Although he only performed two songs, unlike the previous acts who mostly did at least five songs, his vocal and ability to recite words were pretty impressive. It surely did not disappoint his fans who were mostly girls.

Selection of Distress Inks
Funnily enough, it took a pregnant woman and The Afternoon Show to change my mind about jeggings. While styling a maternity fashion segment for the programme, I sneakily tried on a pair from Topshop (€53) meant for one of the models. Not only did they achieve what skinny jeans couldn't (i.e. not turning me into a human turnip), their discrete expandable elastic panel proved commodious enough to accommodate any fat day. Oh joy. Oh insane rapture. Equality achieved! The possibilities were endless - the ability to breathe, cross one's legs, bend at the knee. Whether wearing maternity jeggings will ever be taken seriously by the fashion elite is a moot point but I'm prepared to preach like a crazy convert. It's a new revolution - one that holds manifold possibilities for all body types. Go on, laugh. But if I start seeing less-than-pregnant looking girls milling around Mamas and Papas, I'll know my work is done. In the meantime, I've got a soapbox to mount.
They actually surprised me at the next snack time. In both directions. The first thing I saw was candy bars. Which blew me away. There had already been so much sugar out for us to eat today and then they took it to the highest level of concentration! BUT there were also bags of peanuts. I ate one (the nuts, that is, not the bag - snort) and grabbed two more to keep in my bag for when I need them tomorrow. Because now I KNOW I will need to grab as much protein as I can find every time I see it.

Anyway, "20 words" simply came to me one day in late spring, when I wasn't thinking of anything much. I was in the shower, actually, and suddenly the opening line was in my head. I then got the chance to do the thing which had eluded me so long, that thing which makes writing so exciting, which was to hurry up what I was doing so I could get to the computer (still dripping!) and start to write because the story was coming, like a premature baby, forcing its way out ready or not.

Five or six days per week mix these elements in as many combinations and patterns as creativity will allow. Routine is the enemy. Keep workouts short and intense. Regularly learn and play new sports.
November, when the days are longer; duller; darker. November when the days feel like weeks and weeks feel like but a moment. The feeling almost embraces me now, but I know that there are more things to consider before having to deal with November.

By the time Good Old War came on, the front of the venue got crowded. Good Old War fans are fiercely loyal, and the band responded with a very fan-friendly set. They played a lot of their first record, “Only Way to be Alone,” which is the fan favorite and the record that defines what the band tries to do in all of their other records. That being said, the greatest tracks of the evening were the earth-shatteringly beautiful “Amazing Eyes” and “Weak Man,” which featured an incredible bluesy guitar solo by Dan Schwartz.

It’s true. I’ve been writing up synopses of movies, novels, non-fiction, and short stories for, oh, twelve years now. How many have I published? Zero! How many have I even sent out? Zero! How many have I actually come anywhere near to finishing? Zero! How many have I made significant progress on? Well, one. So yay! Still, it’s not a pretty picture.
Over the next few days we’ll be dissecting why it didn’t work and trying to decide whether there were things we could have done differently that would have brought in the crowds, or whether the whole concept was fundamentally flawed and it’s never likely to be a money-making enterprise.

Night of the Galactic Railroad is a sad tale but it doesn’t use bombastic sad music or heavy dialogs where people brawls their eyes out to convey sadness. It’s very quiet and their dialogs are natural sounding, soft and non explicit. It doesn’t have constant cues to tell you how you should feel and let you figure out how you should feel yourself( with your hand on your penis of course).

A stonking line-up take to the stage at Hammersmith Apollo for the first night of Florence Welch’s sold out three-day residency in London. The singer has become so mighty so quickly that she now wheels out two supporting acts to get the crowd going. We enter a half-filled auditorium to find the stage swathed in red light and happy afrobeat guitars as Babe Shadow make an early-bird audience bounce with their catchy bass lines and summer vibe. Lead man Tom Cawte flits between guitar, accordion and keyboard while delivering a warm, melodious vocal not unlike that of Vampire Weekend’s Ezra Koenig – complete with the odd end-note yelp or two…

I saw that creaming the butter and sugars together was the first thing to get done in the recipe and my heart sank a bit more. It is the single hardest task to accomplish in the baking of things since my KitchenAid mixer died because the alternative is whisking and beating things by hand with a trusty whisk the old-fashioned way or using my immersion blender that (thankfully!) has a whisk attachment that only goes one speed – which is what makes things difficult. Of course I went with my immersion blender – but knowing that until the butter and sugar comes together a bit, the first few turns of the blender was going to result in a (small) tornado of bits of butter and sugar flying around the kitchen, sticking to everything.

In a dutch oven heat over medium high heat and brown pork ribs. Brown all 4 sides well then add the diced onions. Allow onions to soften and brown slightly, about 5 minutes. Add the spices and stir well, sautee for about 3-4 minutes. Spices will stick to the bottom of the pan, that is fine.
Summary: Another example of Anglo-American Imperial literature, this time by an American author at the London School of Economics. Useful not only for what it says about Afghanistan Taliban and Pakistan’s ISI (their close ties have been known for years), but also for what it says about us.

She did great. W.B., on the other hand, has been allowed a certain, well, laxity in church that I never had. My mother would have worn me out if I had lain (laid, lied?) down on the floor between the pew and kneeler during the service. On behalf of my mother, I was mortified. "Papa lets me do it," he declared as I (more roughly than intended) grabbed his arm and yanked him up.

Over the years, I’ve come to love some of these performers. I recognized that they were heavily influenced by older styles or musicians, but I never understood that I liked them as much for the fresh spin they were able to put on the old stuff. Some of these artists have been doing this seemingly forever and others are new to the game. Here are the new originals that I like best:

The new gun laws in Canada had begun to really tighten in the past year, I had not gone through what was required for me to keep the firearms and had no intention of doing so. This meant I had only one year to get rid of all firearms and this also helped me decide to turn it over to the consignment dealer. As each one sold, he’d take his commission, cut me a cheque for the balance and I believe it was just over 1 year when the last gun sold. I’d learned far more than I wanted to about guns – this was Rob’s passion, not mine, but had to educate myself enough to know what was going on.

Without sounding poncey (oh, all right, with sounding poncey) you could trace the themes in my Silk Sisters trilogy back to Ovid’s Metamorphoses. Er, via Marvel Comics. Following an accident involving a bolt of lightning and a pet chameleon, Rorie Silk becomes a ‘human chameleon’: when she puts on someone else’s clothes, she becomes like them in appearance, and takes on their skills as well. I’m fascinated by transformation, and Rorie’s changes, apart from giving me an excuse to cram in loads of fun and adventure, are a metaphor for the changes experienced in adolescence.

Personally, the only real disappointment was that the invading aliens weren’t introduced until about half way through the book. I can understand that there’s still military training in peace time, but I would have liked an idea of their political climate earlier in the book. However, I liked how the protagonist’s (Byron) special skill was revealed later in the book, making it a colourful surprise.

The problem is, I think, that the people who have put together the new procedure haven’t (as far as I know) run a cycle of the awards between them. So they’ve decided what the rules should be, based on what they don’t want to happen (i.e. they don’t want Sam Stone to win again), but don’t seem to have thought ahead and imagined how the awards will play out based on these rules.

Melt the 2 1/2 sticks of butter over low heat. It’s a lot of butter, I know; most recipes called for 3 sticks, I cut back just a little! Once the butter is melted, stir in tsp. vanilla (this is not something I saw in any other recipe; it’s my own tweak, as I LOVE the taste of vanilla and thought this would add a nice extra flavor to the dough layers.)
Floundering in his present, Adam feels an urge to reconnect with his past, and he sets out on a world-wide quest to rediscover his history on his own terms, a history intimately connected with the Mennonite struggle. He dimly intuits that it is in the repair of the thread (now very frayed) connecting him to his past, that he will find the meaning he and his family need, perhaps in time to save them all.

Does Dominique Strauss-Kahn know exactly when he lost his Blackberry on the fateful day of his encounter with Nafissatou Diallo? We know that he first missed it after lunch with his daughter. And we know that the daughter – almost literally – ransacked the restaurant trying to find it. But to this date, it is still missing.
These little nuggets of offal have flavor that reminds me of veal but texture more smooth like organ meat - fried to a beautiful golden brown here to better highlight both. I loved the counterbalance with thin, crispy crust, al dente gnocchi, and the chewy and still slightly crunchy rapini. All held together by the sweet/tart huckleberry.
The exhibit includes "Eroica II" and other richly text-imbued works that seem to channel the artist's affinity for Gnostic wisdom and secret language, transcending graffito, and linking the streets of Brooklyn and the Lower East Side, circa 1980s, until his untimely death in 1988, with those of Rome in the 21st century, at once backward looking and forward gazing. Transgressing boundaries of "high" and "low" art, "life", "death", and most of all, notions of "beauty" and "aesthetics."

3) There are a variety of methods that advertise themselves as “deep tissue,” some patented and some not. These are particularly common among people who specialize in, and talk a lot about, fascia (connective tissue) and adhesions. They can get very excited about the thixotropic properties of fascia – how it softens as it is warmed and worked – and about how it can get stuck to things. Some of them talk a very persuasive line. Unfortunately when it comes to results, no one has been able to show that they are better at fixing anything than the supposedly fluffy relaxation therapists. (See my review of Cherkin's low back pain study, which directly pitted therapists trained in “deep tissue” against therapists who described themselves as doing relaxation massage. The relaxation therapists got slightly better results.) As for adhesions – as Paul Ingraham writes, “In active people . . . it is basically impossible to develop any significant adhesions, anywhere in the body.” People would love to believe that their bodily problems are simple mechanical ones, which can be fixed in the same way you'd fix a car – bang on this part, lube that one up, take this conglomeration apart and reassemble it, and voila, now your neck works fine! But attractive as this idea is, it's almost never that simple. The fact is that the verifiable effects of massage are rather mysterious and maddeningly unspecific. Massage makes you feel better, sometimes dramatically better, but it's very hard to say why.

I was cast by SM while on my way out from winning an award at a competition. I didn’t know what type of company SM was at the time so I had a hard time believing them. I remember thinking, “Is this real? What is this?”
Broadcasters claim their transmission method represents the best and most efficient use of the spectrum because it’s one-to-many rather than one-to-one. It’s not, however, two-way, and that is where the world wants to go with regard to spectrum. So the Sinclair guys come up with a plan to marry broadcasting with the advanced wireless standard, LTE, which a lot of people quietly admit could actually be the best and most efficient use of the spectrum.
Feeling pretty tired from my two days off. Yet, I go back to work for another five day run of 5 mile walks and answering 350 calls a day. I have Thanksgiving and Black Friday off. I put in for PTO for those two days hoping I would have either Tuesday and Wednesday or Saturday and Sunday as my regular days and thus four days in a row off. No such luck. I just get the two.

But what I feel is unfair is that they are pushing me to do things here and there. I should migrate, I should go somewhere else because nothing’s gonna happen to me if I stay here in the Philippines, or the fact that they are still treating me like a baby is too much for me. What’s worse is even my relatives, who think they know me well enough to tell what’s best for me, are also in on the pushing. It’s like they’re telling me that since I’ve graduated already, I can forget about all the values and principles that I learned with my Ateneo education. I’m sorry, but I just can’t do that.

Seattle Police Detective Sergeant Beckman calls the number he finds written on a Copper Gate matchbook cover possessed by a murdered John Doe without any ID. Former Spokane cop turned private investigator Quinn answers the call. The cop asks her to ID the corpse; she does not recognize him nor know how he got her number. At the Copper Gate, Quinn chats with the bartender and receives a text message from Bruno that states: “Stefano must die.” She does not know either man.

Texas Instruments missed expectations but beat if you back out charges for the quarter and the revenue was marginally above expectations.

A spiritual journey is only for the person who is on it. Showing off what you believe or don’t believe does nothing but end up in pride (as Christ said, it’s better to pray in the closet than out in the street)

I’ve got telescopic, hydrostatic joints which can neither break nor become painfully twisted. I have a main and accessory retina housed in each of my insulated and elongated eyes, which focus even the dimmest light into a crystal-clear image. I have three hearts – each barely more than an efficient backwash seal which allows my pressurized blood to make a full circulatory lap every few minutes. My lungs, like yours, operate via vacuum generation which draws air into my body. The only difference is that, without a diaphragm, I straighten my spine and shrug back my shoulders whenever I want my lungs to expand and pull at the air. My body stores no fat at all.
So when 2012 hit I knew I wanted to do these three things; but the big question was when. So I sat down and considered my current state of fitness and what I needed to achieve in order to reach each of these goals safely and effectively. For the tri I need cardiovascular endurance; something that trains up quickly but is lost as easily. For Tough Mudder I need friends, cardio, but also agility and strength. For the fight I need short-burst anaerobic endurance, strength, and technical skill.

Why is that the only time I can run? Well, I could wake up at 5am and run my whole long run in the dark before hubbie leaves for work... An option, yes, but not ideal. I could run on the treadmill while my son watches a movie. Not ideal for either of us.
There are a lot of natural skin protectors and sunscreens in the recipe like Shea butter, Green tea, Comfrey, Aloe vera and beeswax along with Sunflower and Sesame seed oils.
I think there’s a seesaw balance between our interior partial free will and the exterior world acting on us all. Yes, I suppose happiness and a good mental state comes from finding a balance between the two, finding a way to exercise as much judicious control as possible and then a stoic resilience to what happens. Que sera sera, but first I’m going to do my damndest to make que sera the best it can be. We do what we can and then need to let go of everything else. But it’s hard in practice, isn’t it? So, don’t get the idea that I’m going round all calm and stoical – ask my family!
Finding these gifts made me think about what I might leave for my own daughters someday. It isn’t the external value of the gift that matters, but rather the love that it represents.
Despite my seemingly nonchalant viewpoint on this issue, I do feel that way too much prominence has been given to the names of people, when there are so many names that could have been chosen from the natural world such as, animals, flowers or trees (eg. Jacaranda Street) but noooo in this country everything revolves around “WE” - the ANC and their idols, no matter what the cost!”

There’s a lot of this cool reference to violence in the narration. Heavens, one of the scenes even takes place at an archery contest! (The young ladies shoot: it is a beauty pageant with sharp objects.) Some of the searing quality of the tone probably comes from years of Wharton’s evaluation of the provincial New York that was so cruel to her as a very young woman. (She was not pretty; she was not allowed to marry the man she loved.) Her analysis has an unsparing, surgical precision.

One councillor, Councillor Khan, at the first Birmingham EDL demo (July 4th, 2009), said that that there wasn’t any trouble because ‘there were no rival protests to provoke trouble’. That says it all. A Muslim councillor speaking out against the UAF/SWP alliance and thus highlighting that alliance’s own hidden and real agenda of trouble, fascistic bans and revolutionary political change.
My mom just returned from a jaunt to Paris a few days ago and brought me back this lovely umbrella. In case you didn't know, I'm crazy about umbrellas and all things rain. She knew exactly what I would have chosen, had I been there. Oh how I wish I had been there.
I have no opinion on Tim Tebow as a person. I don't know him. I disagree with the stances of his I know of (anti-abortion), but whether he wins or loses doesn't bug me. I don't WANT him to fail because of his faith. But it's the WAY that he's being used, the way the narrative is being twisted to obscure the truth (what happened in the game, how he played, how many missed passes he threw) in order to further an agenda. As Dirk pointed out, even if you're a huge evangelical Christian you should hate how this is being done because if Tebow flames out... where's your messiah now?

Nevertheless, following the normal commercial path to publishing can help to teach an author valuable lessons in patience, dedication, and the feedback to hone their writing talents. Too often, I find that an author considering self-publishing is more influenced by an impatience to 'see their book in print' than the countless rejection slips collected along the road.

Anyway. She gives me this link, and I refuse to click it because just no. But then she starts sending me bits and pieces of these excerpts, and they are just so very bad. My interest is piqued. It’s similar to the reason I’ll watch Showgirls every so often. It’s so bad that it’s actually fun to make fun of. Also, I still like seeing Jessie Spano naked, ok? I grew up on Saved by the Bell just like everyone else who was a kid in the nineties.
Fuck you. Fuck her. Fuck them all. It's just another excuse. It's just another reason why you can't be with me. It's not me. It's you and until you fix you, I will be perfectly happy being alone. And when you ask, my excuse will always be "I have plans."

Chrissy asked if I had any low cost DIY/ decorating ideas to freshen up their bathroom as it is today. The big challenge is that the bathroom flows from pink tile into blue tile, which makes the decorating part pretty tricky! However I accepted Chrissy's challenge and pulled together some ideas. So Chrissy, I hope you are happy with what I brought together (I'm nervous!), but here we go!

At this point my crêpe had settled and, after walking incessantly up and down Portobello, I had regained appetite… so much that I bought the first cuisine I saw: a slice of pizza. My favorite meal back home, pizza in London has continued to disappoint me since arriving, so my hopes weren’t high for this poor slice. It wasn’t bad, though, and for only £1.80 I couldn’t complain. Not full, I continued to peruse the food vendors until stumbling upon a falafel stand. This, on the contrary, was satisfying:
Despite Annie’s murder of Eve, the episode did highlight the struggle she had with even entertaining the idea. She got defensive when explaining to Tom and Hal about her role in the prophecy and even when Cutler attempted to kill Eve, Annie’s first instincts were to protect the child rather than kill.

My all time favorite thing about traveling is finding my way around new cities. I prefer to walk around and get lost and then find my way back again. It is the best way to get to know a city. Another great way to see the city and to cover more ground is by utilizing the public transportation system.

So, on top of everything else, when I came downstairs early Saturday morning I noticed water near the kitchen sink. When I opened the cabinet, water spilled out on the floor. I turned around and went back to bed. It was too much. Later, after I'd screwed up my courage, I pulled all the sodden crap out from under the sink. It was a lot of wet stuff but it wasn't the first time I've had plumbing issues with that sink, so most of it was in plastic containers or wrapped in plastic. The pipes were dripping in three different places. And continued to drip after I turned off the water supply taps. It was a mystery. I sopped up the mess and put bowls under the drips and called the plumber.
Whether you recall Linus' recitation in a Charlie Brown Christmas, or whether you numbly listen to it being read again this Christmas Eve service, Luke 2 is probably pretty familiar territory. Maybe it is so familiar, that like me you have come to only think of those precious words in terms of a quiet stable, a quiet sheepfold, and a baby laying silently in a mound of hay.
This is actually my journal entry from last week for my Core 300 class. It’s a bit of a rant because I didn’t want to or more like I just couldn’t bring myself to do any of the exercises because of stuff I was going through at the time, which I will get into in the journal itself.

However, it was not just Lee Jasper, he and not even cleared his desk before the black organisations and public sector serving black and ethnic firms were complaining about this “racist” investigation and claiming that it should not have happened, because it might have a detrimental effect on the public perception of black and ethnic organisations. In effect what they were saying was that back organisations should be exempt from scrutiny or questions about malpractice or dishonesty because to do otherwise is ........ racist. Once again they were evoking the safe word in the hope that we will shut up and not ask questions.
The new beer list, and the new beer program at the Pizzeria & Public House, will reflect the welcomed hegemony of American-made craft beers – as it should, and as it better reflects both the ideology and the dollar amount of our investment in craft beer, NABC-style.
