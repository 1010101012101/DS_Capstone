In Chapter Eight, Romney discusses education. Because of serious warning signs, Romney has concluded that education is deteriorating in America and this threatens its economic and military leadership. Similar to other issues discussed by Romney, he believes that the examination of data can lead to solutions. Data has shown that reducing class size or spending more money do not lead to improved academic performance, but the quality of teachers does. To improve the quality of teachers, we need to select the best and brightest, work to improve their skills, and monitor performance. “Intervention” is needed if teachers or schools that do not perform. Because of Romney’s love of data, he loves No Child Left Behind. Although he doesn’t directly discuss the appropriateness of the feds in education, he notes that, “Only the federal government had the clout to force testing through the barricade mounted by the national teachers’ unions.” Vouchers are politically infeasible, but charter schools are a viable and promising alternative for school choice.

LÄPPLE: He had been appointed to the parish of the Most Precious Blood in Munich, and he stayed there a year. Before him two martyrs executed by the Nazis had lived and worked there, the chaplain Hermann Joseph Wehrle, killed on 14 September 1944, and the Jesuit Alfred Delp, killed on 2 February 1945. In that first year of his priesthood he had to hold sixteen hours of religion a week, a great many for one just beginning. He supervised the Catholic youth groups also. And he found himself having to make a decision: was he to continue his theology studies, undertake an academic career, or opt for the pastoral ministry in some parish? I, then, did something that was to help
For example. Almost everyone close to me has had a speeding ticket or an accident. I remember when I was 16 my friend had to do Traffic School for a speeding ticket. I jotted that down in my mind, "Stephanie...don't get a speeding ticket. That will suck." Then when I was younger a friend close to me stole something from the grocery store. $400 bucks down the drain for them. "Okay Steph...don't steal. It will suck." When I saw how bad my friend got hurt when crashing on a longboard, I decided to slow down. When I saw someone part their hair in the middle, I learned not to.

A couple of weeks before we found out the gender of our little one, I was looking through genealogy information to find out the exact relation of Fr. Cappel. I was overwhelmed with emotion to learn that he was the son of my great great Aunt Nora. “Nora” being the name I was so fond of, and that I had already picked out for a little girl. “Wouldn’t that be something if this baby is a little girl,” I thought.

DID also backs an Oregon-type law, one which legalises assisted suicide but not euthanasia. Falconer, in contrast, tells us that his committee has concluded that the laws of Switzerland, Netherlands or Oregon would not be acceptable in Britain, yet judging by the examples he is using to argue his case his agenda seems more far-reaching than that of DID – extending to those who are chronically disabled (like Debbie Purdy) and those who would need euthanasia as opposed to assisted suicide (like Tony Nicklinson).

The most important questions that comes to my mind are: Do Nato commanders really think Taliban will dig themselves in the battleground and fight after hearing for weeks that international forces are coming to get them? Or will they melt away in the vast countryside as rebels have done throughout the 30-year conflict in Afghanistan and live to fight another day elsewhere on their own terms?
We rented kayaks one day and traveled the mangrove lined exterior of the island, and got great views of the basketball sized star fish under water. We also got to do some more scuba diving. We signed up with a friendly local company and were on a boat with only two other people. The boat rides to the dive spots are a little longer here than in Roatan so they mostly do two tank dives. This means that you do two separate dives (one tank each), and take a small break in between on the boat. The water and reefs are different here, but have their own unique beauty. We enjoyed experiencing the underworld with creatures such as nurse sharks, big lipped groupers, spotted eagle rays, yellow fin tuna, and sea turtles. One loggerhead sea turtle we saw was so huge we referred to him as grandpa, because he’s got to be old.

When I went to basic training, I received some of the worst advice ever from my cousin; he said something like “don’t let the drill sergeants know who you are”. I think when he graduated from Basic Training, the drills were like, wait, who are you? This is most people. Their goal is not to be noticed. They want to be wall flowers. You’d think that’d be easy to do in camouflage. But, it’s the people that try to blend in and not be noticed who are the ones who are yelled at, dropped for pushups, and singled out. Why? Because, the army needs people who can be yelled at, and can do their job; and not start crying and worry about their feelings and not accomplish their mission. If you can do your job correctly under pressure, then you can do it. There is pressure in war.

There were two stops that my Mexican Personal Assistant told me that I had to stop at: Art & Beer for their famous drinks & decor, and Miguel’s for authentic Mexican food.

Message from Mawu: "There's no greater cause today than giving back to your mother; and rekindling a friendship with the soil, air, and water. The earth is the life force for material life, and there's no sense in continuing a downward spiral of dirtying the planet with further pollution. Your contribution is necessary, no matter how small. You make a huge difference in this planet's welfare through small and simple changes in how you operate. It's worth it, believe me, and I will help you accomplish this goal in all ways."

A number of gizmos are on the market which offer to save this wasted beer. Some divert it into a little sealed vessel attached to the system, from which it can be reintroduced into the line after cleaning - of course, that little bottle will need cleaning at some time - but this doesn't seem like an entirely bad idea. Some cleverly disconnect the beer supply (keg) near the end of a session, while allowing you to sell what's already in the line. Some (for cask) allow the line contents to run (slowly) back into the container after the session - although this would leave the line dry, which may not be such a good idea. In other systems, the beer leaves the dispense equipment - into a bucket perhaps, and is manually reintroduced to the container - these are the ones that look distinctly dodgy to me. You'd definitely want to be sure that Customs & Excise / Trading Standards / Environmental Health aren't going to pounce on you.

The first draft is finished, in as much as the basic story is told but I needed to add around 19,000 words to get it to the length that it needs to be. You may remember that I intended to find those by developing characters and adding a couple of situations and while that is still the case, progress is proving to be slower than I anticipated. I have just taken a current word count and I still need to find just shy of 16,000 words for it to reach the publishers required length.

A novel that covers the same adolescent terrain as Prep, though in an entirely different landscape, Mexican High is an eye-opening, page-turning coming-of-age story about identity, belonging, and first love. In a setting rife with sex, drugs, and political corruption, it is also a revealing look at elite Mexican society, and its freedoms, dangers, and excesses. Monroy’s flawless evocation of the brink of adulthood, in many ways mirrored by the turmoil of Mexico City itself, makes this a truly memorable debut.

The housing, foreclosure, low - if any - new home sales crisis reminds me of the GOM crisis. The blowout preventer was broken as it was broken in the market crisis, or the credit crisis, or the ... etc.. Sort of like 911 too, each crisis militarily industrializes afterwards. We keep having 911 disasters with eternal effects upending the previous story. We know from reading stories there must be an ending somewhere, but there isn't. Most everyone is still living the old story whether they are an unrepentant shopaholic or a Nigerian child selling sodapop in the mud to the pipeline police. Even when attempts are made to reform corruption, the corrupt make the new story instantly throwing everyone and everything into deeper, darker, more terrifying and uncertain futures and still the story goes on. The ever-changing, ever-enlarging story is a way of life now, as if the anomalies of the present are all that ever was or will be.

John Carpenter’s The Thing was taut, though breezy, playing up the “Who Goes There?” (if you’ll pardon the reference) aspect far better than even its predecessor, Howard Hawks’ The Thing From Another World. The New Thing isn’t a prequel to a Cold War science fiction flick, though, it’s a prequel to Carpenter’s The Thing. If you can’t uphold the quality and tension of the flick you’re premaking then just don’t bother.

There are a lot of environmentally friendly practices in place such as recycling and garbage bins side by side in all public areas, very few chemically modified ingredients in foods - less preservatives means less transportation and better freshness, half flush toilets for those small flush occasions, homes built to maximize air flow and low energy use, great walkability and bikability every where in the city as well as city cycles you can rent, tax credits for things like solar and energy saving installations, free public stainless steel electric grills in the parks to encourage group dining outdoors, and free public pools for cooling off away from home on hot days. As a side note, the image above is called a Hills Hoist, and is considered an iconic symbol of Australian innovation. Fact: on sunny days in Brisbane, most laundry can dry in 45minutes on the line.

And yet the "fullness" of the disclosure can be in the mind of the discloser.

Living in the impossibilities is like living life in a box, with walls built out of fear and disconnect. The ruler of that domain is a distorted sense of self, based on struggle, suffering and the belief in separation. This distorted self is determined to control and manipulate reality to suit its belief that there is no love, that one is not welcome on the planet.

When Nik reached the top of the ramp and approached the open doorway to the offices, he wasn’t surprised to see yet another droid; this one waiting for him it would seem. The automaton was of a make Nik was unfamiliar with. It resembled a protocol droid in its general appearance—humanoid form, chromium-plated exoskeleton with gold piping and exposed circuitry at the joints—but had shockingly feminine details. Her face was the most disturbing of those details. Intense yellow photoreceptors that looked almost feline and displayed far more intelligence and…life…than the standard blank, glowing discs that most protocol droids had. When Nik looked into this droid’s face he had a strange feeling that she was looking through his helmet. The area where a normal humanoid’s cheekbones would be extended to sharp fins that made her face look predatory rather than subservient and her vocabulator was molded into cold, pouty lips rather than the open box found on other protocol droids. As he neared, Nik felt a cold feeling in his gut and was filled with a strong desire to pull his bowcaster and punch two fist-sized holes in this things shapely chest.

One can see the opinions on this subject are so divergent and entrenched that it becomes difficult to discern what the respective arguments are.

And I take the chance and bring it to the Lord in prayer. Putting my very heart out there for Him to do with as He pleases.

It's stamped Peak Stainless England on the back. Don't know much about the maker but it's nice to have a piece of bling made in England.

This may include finding an agent to represent you and your work or you may have chosen to approach publishers who are prepared to look at manuscripts directly submitted by authors. Pursuing this path for a period of time can actually prove highly rewarding for an author. It may take one, two or more years, but the outcome at best could be a publishing contract for one or more books, or at the very worse, some editorial feedback and direction from an authoritative and expert voice which can help an author improve their book manuscript and hone their own literary skills.
So instead of trying to blame someone, realize that perhaps the person staring back at you in the mirror is your real investing enemy, and not the active manager or advisor that recommends active fund management.
Here is an article about the SNAP cuts I came across this afternoon.
Then, I tried to get her to make a shape with red and trace around it again and again with the colors of the rainbow. She did NOT like this activity because she couldn't get hers to look "perfect."
So, I’m gonna be honest, I didn’t watch the whole debate. I will add updates to the post if I watch the previous segments.
Fry hamburger in a large skillet. Remove grease using a turkey baster. Add onion and saute for a few minutes. Push meat and onion mixture to one side of the pan. Melt butter on the other side of the pan and pour in the Rice-a-Roni. Saute until slightly browned. Add Rice-a-Roni seasoning packet and stir altogether. Add water and stir, making sure the rice doesn’t stick to the pan. (You will note that the water is more than indicated on the Rice-a-Roni directions. This is to accommodate the vegetables.) Layer carrots and string beans on top. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and cover. Simmer for 15 minutes. Stir and simmer 4 or 5 minutes more, or until all liquid is absorbed. Add salt and pepper to taste and serve.

I know I’m a nerd. I know I’m slightly eccentric. (Slightly? OK, maybe really!) But I feel more like a Slytherin than a Ravenclaw, and I didn’t particularly want Ravenclaw. I would have been surprised if I got Gryffindor or Hufflepuff, because while I have a few qualities from those Houses, I’m just not that much like them.
All that said, we did actually investigate a local triplet that’s for sale down near Macon, Georgia but it’s just too darn large for me. However, if anyone who rides a Large-size frame is in the market for a smoking deal on an amazing triplet, look no further. This thing is easily worth twice what its listed for and the specs are tailored for adults, noting the stoker compartments are a generous 29″.

As the general rolled over again, trying to find a comfortable position on the unfamiliar pillow, he thought he heard small arms fire in the distance.
He moved his desk out into what I call 'Mordor' - the open-plan bit where Yvonne and Julie and whatever-the-fuck-they're-all-called sit. He gave up his office! What a fucking dope! Now he has to sit amongst them and soak up the intellectual spatter as they waste air with talk of their tampons and their babies and their hopes and their dreams.

I would like to send a special thank you to all of you who helped me when I was in the hospital – in so many different ways. It was a horrible place to be (we have an old, decrepit, terrible psych ward here that needs to be rebuilt) but I had outstanding nurses and in some odd ways have very good memories (of being sober and getting some sleep…). I never want to go back, but I am glad that I went.
“Uhm, yes,” said Ibis. “I was otherwise occupied temporarily. I do, um, intend to meet with the magistrate as soon as possible,” he added awkwardly, but the barkeep had no interest in that.
I used a couple of stencils from Coffee Break Design--the dots and the woman silhouette along with my copic ABS. I've decided that to be the most efficient, I'm going to use up the scraps left over from other projects. I have a lot of bits and pieces that I've been hoarding thinking I'd use them and they sit in a pile on my desk. So this is an opportunity to no longer hoard.
Now, I shouldn't jest about him, since at the time, I was lying in bed, snuggled up with Daisy, the cat and reading my iPod. (Lest you think me a total sloth, it was only 7:15 a.m.)

If you’re truly not satisfied with your GDI income you can still cancel or even better… You can consider the $10/month that you’re spending an investment in your education and experience. Obviously you’re looking for more than education and experience right now but chances are if you’re not where you want to be with GDI you may not be that experienced or knowledgeable with regards to internet marketing or mlm and there’s no shame in that. Everyone has questions when they’re first getting started. $10/month for education and experience beats the cost of any other education out there.

These little mats are very easy to do, and I like the hand quilting which produces a pretty ruffled effect when they are washed and dried. Thankfully, they also wash and wear well -- a blessing when you've got a battle-scarred table and very little will to wash and iron table cloths. The mats are just pretty enough to distract diners from the tabletop and focus on the plates.
Jana here. I want to make sure you are sitting down for this one. Are you comfy? OK, now put down the coffee/soda/water. All set down? Okay, you have been warned, and I am NOT responsible for ruined keyboards.
I think this Wryn is so adorable! I'll be entering this also in Tiddly Inks Challenge 80--Sparkle it Up! so I added some rhinestones in the corner and stickles on the flowers. I bought a whole bunch of these rhinestones in different colors from Walmart. I think they were only a dollar for 60 in a package. But now I never see them in stock when I check. Glad I bought a whole bunch then.

These 2 inner pages are perhaps my favourite. Both pages have pockets where baby cards and other keepsakes can be kept. The baby's stats (name, date of birth, weight, etc) can be written on the "welcome baby" card placed on the left pocket front. The right side page has a sweet little journaling card.
One of the great things about the web is how it allows you to communicate ideas and recommended reading with a few keystrokes. In this instance, Philip Athans, author of several books, on his blog, mentioned The Red Hourglass by Gordon Grice. I was a little disappointed at the ebook price as the print price was similar so went with the print book. While I enjoy e-format, the main benefit to me know still has to come in savings.
So today is the reveal for this month's digis.
Having the misfortune of being women writers (and yes, you blasted feminists, I choose my words carefully!), I and a mate of mine were once invited to address The Women Writers' Network in London. One of the main features of this visit was the fact that the committee members would take us out to dinner beforehand at a Dutch Pancake House somewhere near Haymarket.

So what do you get for your Publishers' Desk subscription? No networking opportunities--there's no peer critique functionality, no writers' forum or discussion board, no way to connect with other authors. All the site allows you to do is upload a 350-character (yes, character) excerpt, a query letter, and a synopsis of your work, which becomes part of a database that can be (theoretically) searched by publishers and agents.
Which is why things like The Secret make money, there’s a part of us that is primed by religion and magical thinking that what happens is directed, ordained, destined or that there’s some connecting or correcting mechanism in the universe to make things fair or right according to how we are in the world.
It's time for a new challenge here at Send a Smile 4 Kids and we are challenging you to make and link a card with some buttons, ribbons and/or flowers that a child would like.

Despite what professional analysts proclaim as the “safe stocks” to take a position on, stocks are intrinsically risky. Investors expose themselves to more or less financial risk by harboring certain asset classes over others (i.e. equities vs. bonds) and realizing that a loss (or gain) could occur that may affect their wealth.

Quite a few years ago, I was roughnecking for one of my best friends. Besides me and the driller, the rest of the crew consisted of my friend's brother-in-law and a guy who I knew, but not very well. I knew his family, though, because his dad had worked for my grandfather in the oil field. For the life of me, I can't remember the guy's name...but that's not important for this story. I'm sure he would want to remain anonymous and I can't say as I'd blame him.

I need to make enough money but not too much money, otherwise men will be intimidated. I should have opinions, but don’t voice them too loud or people around you get turned off.
I took a standard M-type for a spin with a telescopic seat post. Bad memories of previous Brompton experiences were soon erased. The Brompton, once you get it going, is an absolute blast to ride. The handling is nimble and quick, my preference for commuting as I don’t want to be caught dozing. Even with the standard bars, I found the bike offered acceptable comfort. With the extra 5-6cms of bar height, longer rides will also be an option.

Imagine in the 200,000 people that come together if EACH one of those people pulled out $1.00 for another soul to save a foreclosure how that would eventually END the crisis of housing that you see going on around you. THIS Is the VERY CAUSE you are pulling together for is it of not? I know there will be of some whom can see this in a deeper injection of you are still promoting the Big Banks in their ways….However change has and always will be a gradual step towards ALL things….Remember Chelas you can not rush “Fine Art” or “Growth” Of those 200,000 people I AM sure that some of those own their “own” business or have opportunity to “Kick Back” some things into this movement in other ways as well. Maybeit in exchange for work done for food/shelter/clothing etc….THIS is barter chelas. A give and receive type of existance you see. As this circle forms and builds it momentums it gets larger and larger in its expansion and growth……and it touches more and more as it travels.
Tafolla’s goal as Poet Laureate, she believes, is to bring the joy of literature into the daily lives of the people of this great pueblo, and to empower the expression of their own poetic voices in our young and old alike. She believes strongly that a multicultural dual-language education is one of the greatest gifts we can provide our children, and that effective family literacy is heavily dependent on the availability of stories and literature to which people can relate culturally and realistically. “Literacy and literature cannot be realistically separated if we hope to have an impact on all of our residents,” says Tafolla. “Powerful stories that reflect our reality reverberate inside us, and give us meaning. Literature cannot afford to be elitist or disconnected from the community.”

The Benadryl kicked in rather quickly and on his way back from paying our $100 co-pay, Kevin and the staff were joking about how that's the most expensive Benadryl he's ever seen. We were mentally preparing to get back home when the PA mentioned he wanted to monitor Samuel for a little bit... like 45 minutes or so. We were moved to another room and snuggled up on the bed under some blankets, since Samuel's clothes had been taken off and he refused to put the gown on (can't say I blame him. I wouldn't wear anything with teddy bears on it either!)
If Administration is unsuccessful, it may well be that the public interest is best served by liquidating the assets of the company in order to pay HMRC what they are due. Selling Ibrox off for housing development could maximise the exigible proceeds as the absence of football crowds on match days would certainly increase local property values to the benefit of residents and investors alike.

Based on the caramel's consistency, I thought it would be a bad idea to pipe it, so I just used a spoon to place a glob of approximately one teaspoon in mid-cupcake. I reminded myself they were supposed to be turtles, and part of their turtle-y charm would be based on a casually careless look.

On their giant blank canvas, the artistic contributions started out as a smattering of squiggles and doodles and very quickly transformed into a high-quality piece of art, which you can see in the amazing timelapse they put together after the fact.
“At least he’s happy” Lisa said to Jinx, who was still lying on the bed but whose sleep had now been disturbed “But she’s still going to be Penelope and I’m stuck with being Queen Matilda.” Lisa was still angry and unsettled. She got up and went to the door, listened carefully to make sure that her father had really gone away this time, closed the door, turned around and went back to her bed.
Play Date is a beautiful shade of purple, and I love how it looks on. It has that lovely Essie jelly crème finish, easily opaque in just 2 coats and yet a bit squishy looking too.

I thought the weekend was supposed to be for relaxing, but I think it's just allowed me to feel the weight of all the stuff from the past week (or two), now that there is space for that. And the feeling is necessary, so fine. But I'm warning next week right now: ease up or ... else.
The book, which I am half-way through reading, is a fascinating and contradictory expression of fear and hope, of critical reportage and German-patriotic pride in hard work and achievement, and of descriptions of harsh conditions alongside those of soaring artistic and intellectual pursuit - a remarkable expression, in fact, of the reality conundrum that Theresienstadt must have been.

In 2011, Gucci Mane released probably a hundred songs over half a dozen albums, mixtapes and collaborative projects, and none of them made anywhere near the impact of his 2009 peak or even his already anticlimactic 2011. Writings On The Wall II, despite being a kind of depressingly convenient sequel to one of his best 2009 tapes that also coincided with his release from one of many stints in jail, was the closest he came this year to recapturing that earlier buzz or the effortless listenability of his best work.
Republican leaders dismissed as a whitewash the findings of an inquiry led by Lord Widgery soon after the shootings.
The walk was a success and it is so good now to think back to that time, especially as two members of that walk now suffer terribly from Alzheimer’s and do not even recall the names of those they love, much less remember the joy they took in the walk we shared. We all returned to Blenheim Lodge after a couple of hours out enjoying some fresh air – and felt the better for it! As I write this now, I wish I could go walking at Elterwater some time again soon. For some information about walking at Elterwater, do take a look at this website, www.walkingenglishman.com/lakes13.htm, which is a personal account of a walk from Elterwater to Skelwith Bridge.

Just to summarize, this particular issue is one of great complexity and no one post can do justice to the situation to explain it fully in terms of its philosophical, theological, and societal implications. I merely wish to raise the question that very few Traditionalist raise, namely, whether or not Traditional Catholics should (or can) attend the Novus Ordo.

Make the ice cream: Measure out the 2 C. milk then take 2 T. of it and mix with the cornstarch in a small bowl. In a large bowl, whisk the cream cheese until smooth.

I can’t tell you all the things I loved about it without unforgivable spoilers, but it was definitely a Joss Whedon production, which means the self-perceptions of all the characters are blown apart and no one is safe from suffering, either physically or emotionally. And bureaucrats suck, of course, but that’s a Marvel thing, too.
JS - One of the arguments that has been put forward and that I know the SPL board will have to decide on, on any newco coming back into the SPL, but one argument between financial fair play and sporting integrity/the cost to the SPL of losing Rangers has been that the broadcasting, the television deal would fall. Is there a clause, is there a written clause in that contract with Sky and ESPN that says that Celtic and Rangers must meet four times a year?

The Ongoing Problem of Race in Young Adult Literature by Jen Doll from The Atlantic Wire. Peek: "Coe Booth...hated reading until she discovered Judy Blume. 'Those made me into a reader,' she said, 'because the books we were forced to read that had black people in them, I didn’t relate to them. As a little black girl growing up in the Bronx, I had no connection to books about sharecroppers or those books that took place in the ‘50s.'" Note: while I worship Walter Dean Myers on bended knee, I'm not sure he's completely on mark about the Texas market. As a Austin based writer who travels regularly, I've noticed a lot of state-wide enthusiasm for diverse youth literature, especially with regard to books featuring Mexican or Mexican-American characters and themes.
I wouldn’t exactly say that separateness is an illusion, as many non-duality teachers would. Not an illusion but an aberration – something which exists but shouldn’t. Children don’t experience separateness; they exist in a state of natural relatedness to the world. This is one of the reasons why childhood is so wonderful – because the child feels connected to everything around them, in a participatory flow with all experience, with no ‘in here’ or ‘out there.’
Or a lack of care, education, and careful thought?
I think the freedom camp is basically going to be a town that’s been fenced in, probably has surveillance everywhere, but more to the point is patrolled by drones making sure we don’t get too rowdy. They let the inhabitants move in and out, but if they hang out too long in the countryside by themselves they will be “escorted” back to the camp or terminated. The rules are different than for a prison. Similar but not exactly the same. There actually is a little bit of Freedom in the ol’ Camp.
Just around the corner from St Stephen's Walbrook is the Temple of Mithras. It was only discovered in 1954 and was actually on Walbrook originally but it was moved to Queen Victoria St as the original site was destined to become office blocks.

For almost 4 years I gathered spontaneously with this group of called out ones. They were called, not to be preachers or religious professionals. No, they were called to passionately pursue the Presence and will of God — to seek first God’s reign and His right living. (See New Testament verse: Matthew 6:33.)
They had them in today, but it was too frozen to serve, ironic isn't it. We had to wait over an hour before they could serve it. So we ran to Chapters, Staples and Superstore to waste time in order for her to get it.

Why I think you should see this: This film in my opinion is the best of the Bourne series and successfully ties up the story started in the first film. Matt Damon is incredible yet again and after three films it is evident that he is Jason Bourne. The action is non-stop yet again and supporting cast is great yet again. I absolutely love this series and recommend it to everyone.

It was in 1957 that Bert Weedon's guitar instructional manual, Play in a Day, was first published. In the end it would sell two million copies and teach generations the rudiments of guitar playing. Play in a Day would be followed by Play Every Day. Over the years VHS and DVD versions of the books would follow. His books would be the starting point for many important guitarists in the history of rock music.

Hell is an emotive subject. Its character is real and awesome. Our Lord himself repeatedly spoke of it in the most solemn terms. The eternal punishment of the wicked used to be a common element in evangelical statements of faith. Todays evangelicals, however, are not so sure about hell, as more and more question hell’s unending duration and prefer to speak of some kind of annihilationism. Even highly respected evangelicals like John Stott hesitate to be dogmatic about this. The 1996 General Synod commended a report called, The Mystery ofSalvation which the popular media saw as reducing hell to nothingness, leaving evangelical critics of the report in a minority.
Southern states carry out more than 80 % of the executions but have a higher murder rate than any other region. Texas has by far the most executions, but its homicide rate is twice that of Wisconsin, the first state to abolish the death penalty. Look at similar adjacent states: There are more capital crimes in South Dakota, Connecticut and Virginia (with death sentences) than neighboring North Dakota, Massachusetts and West Virginia (without death penalties). Furthermore, there has never been any evidence that the death penalty reduces capital crimes or that crimes increased when executions stopped. Tragic mistakes are prevalent. DNA testing and other factors have caused 138 death sentences to be reversed since I left the governor’s office.
Jason's twin brother, Robbie, moves into town, and things go haywire. Sofia is now running for her life - and Jason is forced to share hidden secrets with her.

That said – all hail the hilarious Sean Combs. Showing the same comic touch (and surprising sense of humor about himself) he displayed 10 years ago in Made, Diddy is actually my favorite thing about Greek, easily stealing scenes from Russell Brand and Jonah Hill. Every time he shows up, the movie gets a shot of adrenaline in the shoulder.
The narrative minimal too! I imagine a surreal representation of emotions, a doll for a lost child, a clock for a lost past. Dark, twisted, Tim Burton-esque depictions. I think I scared a few people the other day when I said “orange-juice amniotic-fluid”. We were thinking of child-abortion see and Gloria I think said something bout orange juice see. Gosh I like that phrase… far more then I think its healthy to like.

I realize that I may want control or safety more than I want love sometimes. And by sometimes I mean all the time. Its incongruent. How can you want love but be so repulsed by it? Much in the same way you crave validation and attention but hate being seen. Whatever you want most is what you get. My energy has been so dedicated to protection that I realize I have been closed off to many splendid and intoxicating joys. I have stayed nestled in the arms of a woman, only her arms were my own. Folded into myself wanting desperately to be hidden. I said to myself today, “You are safe. Let it go,” I wasn’t sure what it was I was holding on to…but my evening changed right then. My breath was sure and for the first time today I didn’t feel like crying or sleeping.

Sometimes trust takes time to build and develop, while other times, trust is given merely because of one's position. In such a case, it is assumed that the position automatically comes with the requisite knowledge and experience, even though that might not be the actuality. The assumption creates a responsibility for that person to live up to the perceived trust. In time, that assumed trust can be shattered if the person bearing the position proves unworthy, destroying any chance of a further relationship.
The Oven – This is the classic staple in Lincoln’s Haymarket district. When you move to Lincoln and ask what restaurants to visit, I guarantee that this will be one of the first responses. They specialize in north Indian cuisine and have the best mulligatawny soup in Lincoln. The garlic naan is also excellent. This is an excellent date spot because it’s down in the Haymarket, one of Lincoln’s oldest and most unique areas, and is a block from the excellent Ivanna Cone and Indigo Bridge Books. It’s also a great spot for dinner on First Friday because it’s also within walking distance of most of Lincoln’s art galleries. One final word – if you’re a first time diner, it’s not a bad idea to split an entree with a friend. Their portions are massive, but also a little bit pricey. So if you’re wanting a good meal but want to save some money, you can get plenty of food, some naan and two glasses of wine for $30 to $35 if you just order one entree.
To this day, whenever I arrive home in SFO from anywhere in the world it's like I've been reborn to the City I love. Traveling on the BART from the airport to 16th Street and surfacing to the city of sights and sounds and smells makes me smile and forget my worries. I suppose that's what they mean by coming home again.

She could feel his hardness against her hip. Every cell of her being had been awakened with his kiss. Her mind raced with images of passion igniting between them. The desire he stirred just with his kiss was overwhelming. She moved her hand down his back, resting it at the small curve there. He smelled like strong spice and leather. She could taste the wine on his lips mixed with a stronger, fiery something. The vaguest hint of it touched her taste buds when his tongue tangled with hers. He tasted like heaven or decadent sinful desire, her every fantasy in the flesh.

Benito Mussolini was murdered in cold blood by terrorists fighting for the Zionist Internationale, or as it is frequently called, the New World Order. Mussolini's crime was to overturn the economic domination of the usurers, and to root-out the Freemasonic agents of the international money power. At no time did he set up concentration camps for Jews, yet still he has been labelled as a key figure in the fabled holyhoax. The economic ideals of Mussolini greatly benefited Italy. He was a European Nationalist, but a fervent Italian patriot, with no thought of global domination - unlike those who fought against him, and are even now building a single Global Slave State.

The weather has been surprisingly nice in Buffalo, and we really enjoyed the month! My mother started it off by throwing a Super Bowl party. Now if you know my mother, you know she can’t resist putting her creative talents aside when throwing a party. After a couple hours with my Aunt Robin cooking and cleaning for the party, she got out her aluminum foil and proceeded to make a Vincent Lombardi trophy. I figured most people wouldn’t believe how impressive it actually was, so here is photo proof. Pom poms and all.

These are Kristen's biggest problems at school. Today was her last full day of school. On Friday, we have the singing program and then she is done for the summer. As I was waiting in the car line today, one of the directors came over to chat with me. Kristen decided she kept needing to try to hold the little boy's hand next to her during practice, felt like she needed to pull her dress up a couple times, and sang "most of the time." What more can I do to help her?

Christianity is not based on the promises man makes to God! Christianity is based on the promises God has made to man! That is why there is grace, repentance, forgiveness, mercy and love. God has given to each one the right of family. I believe that is why there is a stirring desire for more. It is time for the glory to have greater manifestations in and through our lives.

If I were to have colored it so only the top bloom was well-lit then the movement and balance (M, B from DUMB-V) would be that all attention flowed to the tip of the top bloom. This would be totally appropriate if I had a focal something there, say a butterfly perched on the top bloom. I'd want the butterfly to be most important, so I'd have all colors pull your eye towards the butterfly. If I were to use the final lilac with other exterior elements in a layout then maybe I would want only one bloom important so it would pull your eye into that object.

Hello again, my friends! We are back from London, and I am bursting with stories to tell and pictures to post in the coming days. First, I need to unpack, do laundry, catch up on emails and phone calls, and do all the other nonsense one does after a week away. In the meantime, I just had to share with you these spring flowers from a beautiful street stall in Greenwich. One of the things I love most about traveling ever since I started The Magpie's Fancy is that I often take photos and collect memories with you in mind. It sharpens my eye and broadens my perspective, which is, I do believe, a good thing.
The implants utilized in breast augmentation particularly saline and silicone manufacturers are obtainable in varied shapes and sizes. Each one of the size and shape are anticipated to include a different expression to the user. The sort of body and the bust size the user has would also affect they sort of implant to be used. A qualified fellow of plastic surgeon can provide enough recommendation regarding size and shape of the implant. Both implants are made of a silicone, rubber-like shell stuffed with either the silicone or saline in-fill. Aside the shape and the size, the implants additionally are available as either being contoured or being smooth. The implant may additionally be studded. This texture assortment are more of preference and a few folks say that they’re extra comfy than the smooth options. Another range obtainable with the silicone sort of implant is the gummy bear. This sort of engraft is made in such a way as to not leak even if reduce into two. It however requires clinical trial before use on a patient.

All in all, it was a good festival. I just wish I'd paced myself. I was really feeling it on the MAX ride home, and hated to miss the bulk of Rick & Brandi's BBQ. Rebecca did come back for me and we hung out and chatted, then played some Texas Hold 'Em.
With the goals I set for myself at the beginning of the month, I feel the over all theme is being proactive! Proactive in my walk with the Lord, Proactive with my health, Proactive with keeping up with my house, Proactive with menu planning... you get the point being PROACTIVE!!!
Back on planet Earth…Yes, there are support groups for those that want more than a brief chat and a fast escape but not everyone is comfortable in such situations. I’ll be honest. I’m not. If you get fed up with a group it’s a bit awkward to retrieve that sticky, illegible leaflet and start reading it as you sit in the same room sipping coffee. If you stop going to meetings all together? Well in a small place like Tynedale you can end up leaving bruised feelings with a few. So no, not for me.
I am doing pretty well. I finally, FINALLY! go to stop taking the blood pressure medication which is wonderful. After only 2 days of being off it I feel a million times better, but I also think that has to do with the wonderful weather we have been getting and vitamin D :) The house is still a mess all the time and I always have moments where I feel like everything is falling apart but I also feel like we are doing a little bit better and getting into a routine as a family of 5. I am hoping I can do a little better at keeping the house tidier and making dinner on top of paying attention to the kids and working on photography. I am excited to start taking pictures for clients again once spring blooms (it is in May here in NY!) but I am glad I still have a couple more months to get myself in order.
For starters, there’s the stuff. And I mean, STUFF. Months before Halloween itself, the department stores start bringing out Halloween paraphernalia, from pumpkin-shaped chairs to decorative witches to hanging cobwebs to flying broomsticks to ghost-lamps to skull fairy-lights to…you name it, it’s there. The restaurants are all decorated, the candy all starts coming out in one-kid portions (Reese’s even brings out pumpkin-shaped cups), and Party City becomes the most happening place to be.
Anyways onto the treatment because that’s what you’re here for right?!
And, yep, that was it for this week. I felt as if the patient stories, while minimally mirroring our docs’ lives, were just filler. We’ve had so much going on in our main characters’ lives that they were somewhat an unwelcome distraction. Melody’s story was much stronger than Reyes, but it felt like Reyes was given more airtime for an uninteresting resolution. What did you think?

The idea of the dots got me to thinking, and I saw this book on String Art in the store, so another pattern was born--well, re-idealized, might be a better word. String Art has been around since man had boards, pegs and twine. I know that other tangles patterns that look very similar to this have been posted, but I don't think any of them follow these steps, so I went with it. If you do know of anyone else that has used steps like this, please let me know so I may give the credit to them instead of myself.

I don't want to say too much as I'm guessing that the set at their debut Edinburgh gig (details right here) this coming Saturday will be very similar and maybe even identical. Let's just say that some songs made very unexpected appearances in the set while the running order was quite different from recent shows. Overall, it made for an excellent performance that was probably the most slick, professional and disciplined I've seen them pull off.

Lisa Nakamura, in her book Digitizing Race and in her lecture, examined the representation of racial identity on the Internet and the construction of this visual, racial image. In her analysis, race becomes reconstructed through images but does not necessarily break down social constructions of race, which has led to a continuance of racism and stereotypes in the digital world. Browner works from a different angle by analyzing race in relation to literary scholarship, publishing, archiving and collections. In this form multiethnic literature has become more accessible and better archived. Furthermore, the digital world can be manipulated to better suit the forms and principles of multiethnic literature. But as Browner continues, there are still issues of accessibility and funding. Finally, Anna Everett in her article “The Revolution Will be Digitized: Reimaging Africanity in Cyberspace” examines the black community’s use of and contribution to the Internet. Showing that there were/are many blacks who contributed to the creation and development of the Internet, she also emphasized the lack of recognition of these individuals and groups.
Ah, human Daleks. This was the masterplan. It makes one wonder if The Cult of Skaro was present during this story and never quite let go of this idea. It never seems to work, though, does it? In the end, Maxtible is turned into a human with Dalek tendencies and The Doctor turns all Dalek drones into Daleks with human tendencies. Those tendencies include questioning orders rather than following blindly. And then they destroyed each other. A nice, tidy ending.

Dogberry’s misspeaking aside, The Villain of my nightmares is not going anywhere near redemption.
In doing so, his work appears less fatalistic than it had previously been yet Cohen manages to exert the same emotional astuteness as before, with the added ripeness of experience. The Book of Longing has the personal feel of a poet’s journal while the disparity between the spiritual undertakings and the physical urges, between the hunger of youth and the satiety of old age, gives it much of its variety and appeal. It may not be my favourite of Cohen’s collections but it is one that paints a highly personal portrait of the poet and his remarkable artistic vision. And yet by Cohen’s own admission his poetry may only “refer” to “everything that is beautiful and dignified” while being neither, however, I would argue that the poetry’s not in the beauty but in the emotion which “has found words”. And that it definitely has.

Steve Wolfe focuses on books, and his aims might be considered more personal than philosophical. His 2-D drawings and sculptures feature the cheap, well handled paperbacks that are stuff of serious readers. These books, with their dog ears and tears and bloated contents, have been read over and over — the attention that is paid by Wolfe to his trompe-l'œil detailing matches the detail that the apparent readers have paid to each book. Like Oshiro, the touches, the evidence of their handling, are present.

He is known as the most high-profile victim of the Titanic disaster that happened 100 years ago last week. Philanthropist, businessman and part of the American high society of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, John Jacob Astor IV published this futuristic tale in 1894 about a journey around our solar system and man’s attempts to colonise his neighbours.

The gate swings open to reveal a corridor that progresses through the four seasons. It's a magical moment when you first see the transition of colours.

Speaking of kicking the bucket, Charlie did that in 1925, which means that the Turn Me Over series was pretty much the last thing he published. As bad as it is (if you can make out the drawings both ways on all of these, you're doing at least 50% better than me), I guess we must forgive him since he was pushing 70 and maybe not feeling too great.
While soaking up the golden age of art cinema, Despins and Dumaresq started talking about their own artistic ambitions. Despins credits his friend with giving him the necessary encouragement: “I was teaching mathematics at the time. I quit that job, the school was a terrible place, and started working in the evenings. Bill was the one who suggested I should go take a film course. I went for an interview with the London Film School, and got on that course. I don't know if I would have done that had Bill not said, why don't you do a film course? So I was working nights, teaching somewhere, and did this film course that took about eight months to a year. I was still at there in 1964 when Bill and I started work on something he had written called ‘The Slain Girl’. By that time I was living in a flat in Paddington, and had a child. We took over my sitting room for a long time preparing this film. I lit the scenes, the whole thing was going to be done in that room. We didn't finish it, but that was the first thing we did together. I remember putting it on at the London Film School and the person teaching camera said the lighting looked alright. It was based on a poem of Bill's. I would do the lighting, set up the shot, then show it to Bill and see if it was alright with him.”

When in making decisions in business, there are plenty of decisions made in the grey area. I see it every day from “making a bluff” to get a client to do what you want to hiring illegal workers for the kitchen of your restaurant. These decisions seem fine and manageable at first but eventually more grey decisions are going to have to be made to cover for the first. The worst part is that in time you will be caught. Then all your work goes down the drain and you are no longer reliable.

There is multiple endings but have to make the choices I didn’t want to my first time around isn’t appealing to me.

Games often lack good narrative but have gameplay or vice versa Catherine has both and is better for it. If you enjoy puzzles then you will enjoy Catherine, if you enjoy romance then you will enjoy Catherine. It may not be for everyone but it is a game worth your time even if only once.

If things aren't going well though, my best advice would be to narrow the question. Broader questions are usually more complex. I started conservation of mass with, "What happens to atoms in a chemical reaction?" (Actually, the question was about why ice melts when you heat it but paper burns) and kids were flying all over the place. They generated their own claim and designed their own experiments and it was a disaster. There was no real way to differentiate through experiment most of their claims (atoms are being fused together, atoms are exploding, atoms turn into heat). I rebooted with whether atoms are destroyed or not in a chemical reaction and it worked much better. We all did a similar experiment and students were able to make a well-reasoned argument that atoms weren't destroyed.

Australia’s batting line-up also faces scrutiny with newcomer Peter Forrest making 66 on debut in Sunday’s defeat by India to bolster his chances of remaining in the squad. “I know the selectors are meeting today so I’ll be sitting by my phone tomorrow (Tuesday) hoping to get a call,” Forrest told reporters in Brisbane on Monday. “Yesterday was a great day and one I’m not going to forget. “It was nice to contribute but it would have been a lot nicer had I got 80 plus or a hundred and got the side to a win.”

This is a lovely merino/silk blend in a dk weight. Unfortunately, as beautiful as the colors are in the skein, I have learned through hard experience that I don't at all like the way variegated yarns look knit up. In fact, the sweaters I've knitted from variegated yarns have mostly found their way to the dyepot after the fact.
Not sure about rest and recuperation. We've just got back from a lovely two-week cruise, all round the Med. Everything was going swimmingly and in the diary I keep for my mother, I'd just written: "The holiday has done us good. We feel great." That was a BIG mistake because the very next day (final day of the cruise and the packing day) we hit what the captain described as "a big depression and a huge swell" in the Bay of Biscay. Neither of us suffer from sea sickness (obviously, or we'd be very silly to book cruises) but that did for us. I spent the day between the cabin bed and the bathroom. Every time I tried to get out of bed to pack I was thrown across the room, and head-swimming, had to fall back in. In the end my husband did my packing as well as his own. Once out of the Bay of Biscay we both improved, but only enough to have melon slices brought by room service for our evening meal. Driving home we felt shattered, looked rotten and wondered whether we'd ever book another cruise - EVER.

My right brain embraces the veiled depths of subjective art, delights in suggested line and shadow, and loves to add its own storyline to that of the author. I am often moved by subjective art without always knowing why. It doesn’t have to be skillfully done; I just know that the artist made a successful connection.
Nevertheless, the fact remains. Our feelings come and go, but Christ is risen; he is risen indeed! And if we die with him, we shall also live him. If we endure; we shall reign with him.

El Kudz, as Arabs call Jerusalem, is, from a certain distance, as they also call it, shellabi kabir. Extremely beautiful. Beautiful upon a mountain. El Kudz means The City, and in a certain sense it is that, to unnumbered millions of people. Ludicrous, uproarious, dignified, pious, sinful, naively confidential, secretive, altruistic, realistic. Hoary-ancient and ultra-modern. Very, very proud of its name Jerusalem, which means City of Peace. Full to the brim with the malice of certainly fifty religions, fifty races, and five hundred thousand curious political chicaneries disguised as plans to save our souls from hell and fill some fellow’s purse. The jails are full.

The reason is simple: the divide between the believer and the explorer is, at this moment in time, almost non-existent. Their questions, concerns, challenges and struggles have become virtually identical. Both are spiritually illiterate yet hunger for spiritual experience. Both have grown up in a post-Christian context and share a wisdom-deficit along with theological hunger. Both are eager to know how Christ intersects the deepest needs of their life and speaks to the deepest questions of their mind.

Jennifer Haigh excels at empathizing with families in crisis. Her writing may be painfully realistic but readers sense that she loves her characters with all their warts and wrinkles. She is a masterful storyteller of the human condition on a par with Jonathan Franzen in my opinion. The Franzen of Freedom that is, not of The Corrections.
Lubiano also describes her classroom style, where “I would talk about the discourses that come together.” Sports, for instance—which according to Lubiano, is “an incredibly elaborate discourse.” (She admits that she doesn’t “know anything about it,” but has no problem speaking about it in the classroom.) “You could think of football or food or cancer treatment as a collection of social texts”—all of these things, she says, illustrate the “social order.”

Enduring images of jataka stories, alluring actresses and dashing heroes of popular movies flashed before my eyes and then abruptly the bioscope came to an end. The bubble busted and the bioscope man receded into darkness.

There’s nothing quite like getting struck by lightning and thrown from The Tower to get stuck energy moving again! Actually, solar flares, which root out anything that no longer serves, come pretty close. The Major Arcana (first 22 tarot cards) represent Archetypes, and The Tower stands for much needed radical change that has been resisted to the point of requiring some kind of Divine Intervention to get things moving. Of course, we are the ones summoning such interventions. When our souls feel so restricted by “what is” and yet know, instinctively that there is soooo much more, then we have options. We can prepare ourselves to take a flying leap, knowing we will find wings when we need them. We can refuse to budge yet keep screaming for solutions outside ourselves, in which case, a lightning bolt may arrive as the proverbial “blessing in disguise.” In a vibrational Universe, though, nothing occurs completely outside ourselves. I often quote Carl Jung, “Whatever is not conscious will be experienced as fate.” When we desire change from the deepest recesses of our soul but refuse to take action towards those changes, eventually that screaming desire wins out.
Albert Einstein, as a youth, would have likely received an ADHD diagnosis, and maybe an ODD one as well. Albert didn’t pay attention to his teachers, failed his college entrance examinations twice, and had difficulty holding jobs. However, Einstein biographer Ronald Clark (Einstein: The Life and Times) asserts that Albert’s problems did not stem from attention deficits but rather from his hatred of authoritarian, Prussian discipline in his schools. Einstein said, “The teachers in the elementary school appeared to me like sergeants and in the Gymnasium the teachers were like lieutenants.” At age 13, Einstein read Kant’s difficult Critique of Pure Reason—because he was interested in it. Clark also tells us Einstein refused to prepare himself for his college admissions as a rebellion against his father’s “unbearable” path of a “practical profession.” After he did enter college, one professor told Einstein, “You have one fault; one can’t tell you anything.” The very characteristics of Einstein that upset authorities so much were exactly the ones that allowed him to excel.

Several years ago I drove everywhere and a lot. I drove to any city I could within reason and loved it. I love the sub-culture of road tripping with back roads and truck stops and gas station restroom breaks. But then my time to myself began getting smaller and my bank account began getting larger until I found myself flying most places instead of driving. This culminated in the decision this year to fly to St. Louis for Bouchercon instead of driving. I still kind of regret not making that drive, but convenience-wise the flight did work out better.
These are criticisms I was preparing myself to rework yet again for “Dragonfire,” the final story of the disastrous Season 24…but as it turns out, “Dragonfire” isn’t such a disaster after all. Now in fairness, I’d always recalled it as being the highpoint of that season, but then I also recall thinking “The Curse of Fenric” was one of the greatest Who yarns of the 80’s, and via the lens of today that’s hardly the case. (FYI: “Fenric” and “Dragonfire” share the same writer – Ian Briggs). Surely “Dragonfire” would be another case of the memory cheats? Not so. Now, to be sure, it’s far from a great Doctor Who story – it has too many little problems to be called great – but it is a pretty good one provided you can look past those problems.
The other robbers, hearing the shotgun blasts, realizes that something has gone wrong, so after grabbing the mail bags, they hightail it.

Watching them, I found myself thinking a lot about God and His love for us. He has a bottomless supply of patience, too. With all of us. Even those of us who can be quite challenging.

As we all know, training a new puppy can be a real challenge. By making sure that you use the best and most effective techniques, you will be able to cut out the anxiety that both you and your puppy can experience while getting he or she housebroken. Maybe you are concerned about your time away from home while working or running errands away from your pet? Perhaps you are not able to take your new puppy for a much needed walk at random intervals during the day? It is vital, then, that you consider alternatives that will make life a new puppy a lot less complicated.

Mouse needs money to pay more shit to the Department of Homeland Security before I.C.E.–that’s Immigration Customs Enforcement for you Brits and Aussies–arrests her.

That may be a good thing as I’ve said before, but then again, it would mean no more mouse sketches for you.
I guess what I’m getting at is that if you look at all the tribes at Knowmads and think we are so cool for attending a school like this, then thanks for the props but I don’t think any of us came to Knowmads to gain cool points. It just so happens that the Knowmads school functions extraordinary different than other business schools. What I think really makes us cool is that we all decided to go down a path many haven’t discovered. We are all people who haven’t found what we are looking for in life and Knowmads might be it. I look at all the current and past tribe members and am extremely impressed that we all embarked on a journey marked with so much uncertainty. We have no idea what we’re going to get out of our 12 months or who we’re going to end up being. That’s pretty cool to me.

So there I was, spending another uneventful afternoon alone in the warehouse. I went to the bathroom to yoo-ren-nate and I must have thought I was Travis Bickle or something because I started making faces and talking to myself in the mirror. This wasn't a pep talk or a pre-fight motivational speech (although there is a retard who's supposedly going to try and fight me at some point this evening), it was just me being a bored idiot and working on my face warping skills.

In the days since Tyson' Gay’s “upset” victory over Usain Bolt, much has been written and said. From message board arguments, to newspaper articles, to other bloggers.

I’ve seen everything from “Bolt didn’t take Gay seriously”; to “Bolt wasn’t trying”’ to Bolt was out of shape”; to “the race didn’t matter”.

When colluding with a psychopathic sexual predator even willing victims get pimped, swapped, gang banged and debased no matter what pseudo-philosophical or pseudo-literary justifications the psychopath offers for such sleazy and perverted ways. Eventually even their sleaziest partners get used up and tossed away by the psychopath like dirty condoms, when their use value is gone or when a a better target or opportunity comes up. As you make your bed, so you must lie in it. And if you choose to lie next to a psychopathic partner, then you will eventually wake up next to an individual who uses you, demeans you under the guise of compatibility and love and who will one day callously toss you away to replace you with a new trophy.

We had stopped at every cross street that opened to Ground Zero, and hung our heads. We had stalled, holding back tears, where instant graves had blossomed on wrought iron fences or granite walls. The graves drew out the grief, and tears gave names to what were earlier anonymous faces: A wife to one of those still missing stumbled into a huddle, and crumbled to the ground, touching a framed picture adorned with ribbons now frayed and fading. She had visited this grave each day since. A brother to one still lost crept from behind us quietly planting another candle where what he lit last night was dying. He had no way of telling if his brother was among the dead; he was still missing like many who walked into that ordinary summer day but whose bodies have not been found.
1. Reason claims because the Supreme Court will only overturn the individual mandate but leave the rest of Obamacare…because Romney and the Republicans don’t have the guts now to overturn the rest of the law we should let Obama stay in office and let a real reformer get in office in 2016 who will then overturn the law. Common sense states that you would give some reasons to back this up but Reason’s article seemed quite lacking, in well, reason.
So, I'm now working up in Northern California. As I live in LA, this involves weekly air travel and taxi rides. I have to say that the standard of hackney carriages in San Jose is woeful, every single one I get in stinks and many scare the shit out of me, the drivers are, perhaps unsurprisingly horrible and are possibly the source of the smells that seem have been absorbed by the headliner in every last vehicle. I usually like the smell of curry, as you know, but there is a time and a place for it. The backseat of an 89 Crown Victoria is not the one.

Research in developmental psychology indicates that our worldview and moral development proceed in relatively linear stages, for example from pre-conventional, to conventional, to post-conventional. In addition, there is strong evidence that the average mode of moral development of a population is strongly associated with the types of social structures, institutions, and cultures that the population will have. Along these related arcs of individual development over a lifetime and social evolution over recorded human history, we find opportunities for a new take on natural law and a new story arc for humanity.

Third, he might just mean “there’s no reason to require that anyone have any reason for believing anything”, but since interpreted one way that’s just asserting as obvious the whole conclusion that the paper is aiming at (which would be silly), and interpreted another way it’s just weird (of course rationality requires something of our cognitive behavior, or it has no content at all), I will assume that he doesn’t mean that.

CL. I came fairly late to working with sound although I had relatively low-key piano lessons as a child. Looking back many of the seeds were there – I asked for a reel-to-reel tape recorder for my 8th birthday and used to spend loads of time recording anything and everything, although I have no idea where that desire came from. Before that I had an old valve radio in the shed and used to play games which involved pretending to contact people. I actually grew up in a totally non-musical and non-technical family so it’s a bit of a mystery why I got into this. In the early 80s I found myself performing in a cabaret at the Edinburgh Festival – I was a pretty bad performer and actually hated it but we were accompanied by two musicians playing with electronics, synths and tape machines. I had a total “that’s what I want to do” moment. Over the next few years I tried everything I could think of to learn about making and manipulating sound – I volunteered to help people engineering, I went to classes in the studio at the wonderful Morley College and …well there wasn’t much else you could do then, so I started my first faltering steps of composing and making work using technology. At the same time I was really getting into playing music – with other women and also in a political street band that was incredibly active in the peace and anti nuclear movement so I was going on actions all over the UK and sometimes in Europe.
I am better at protecting myself now. I don't keep in close contact with friends who are pregnant. I want to, I am happy for them, but it makes me even sadder for us. When a fellow babyloss Mom wanted to meet me with her 3 month old baby (Cub would be 3 months old now, I said that I would love to meet, but I have to wait until I am in a better place to spend time with the baby and see her mothering the baby). She said she would leave the baby at home. Even last month, I wouldn't have said that, I would have gone and felt terrible for hours after. My Mom wanted me to join a choir with her that will sing Christmas carols at different places in December. I'm not exactly looking forward to Christmas. I'm not dreading it as much as I was last year, but I'm not looking forward to it. I had to say no to her more than once about the choir. I used to love Christmas carols, but I don't listen to them anymore and I certainly don't want to start singing them now. Normally I would have given in to make her happy, but I stayed strong and said no, even though I knew I was disappointing her. But I did was is best for me.

I admit I was quite worried about reading this book. It is the first time I have been asked to review an author’s work! I’m so pleased I did though. This book is historical fiction and modern romance all in one- it gets a little racy at times!

Given that Abercrombie is one of Gollancz's biggest authors at the moment what with hitting the British best-seller lists pretty high up they'll probably want to get it out as soon as possible.

For attractive home make-overs on the cheap, I always turn to IKEA. I've got a real soft spot for this big blue box, because I'm always able to find something I can hack and turn into exactly what I'm looking for. Like these sconces. I've been infatuated with brass sconces lately. Brass sconces with a black shade are even better. To achieve a similar look, I sprayed these IKEA sconces a metallic gold and topped them with some simple black shades found on the next aisle over. Total cost with the shade: $25.

It wasn’t all bad, though. There was a lot to look back on in his post and think, “yeah I nailed that one,” or even just being reminded of which songs connect to each memory from college. ”UKNOWBIGSEAN” will forever remind me of “seizing the day” sophomore year with my friend Marcus in The Dungeon (his Temple Towers room), which only meant opening the blinds and rolling another doobie. And I’ll definitely always be reminded of belting out “Last Kiss” on my 21st birthday with my buddy Zack whenever I hear that Eddie Vedder growl.

HAPPY MONDAY:
Starting in 2007 we have had quite an economic ride with ups and downs. Growth slowed again in 2011 but never went negative. Remember that it is possible for a company to have more profits with less workers. This is due to ever increasing productivity. This is how the nation can have a growth in GDP with a decline in jobs.
TVXQ’ Yunho said, “As expected, it was a dream stage. Personally, I really respect Michael Jackson, so it was really touching to be able to stand on the same stage as he did. The feeling of “maybe this way I can be on the same level as him..” overtook me. This is something I could never have imagined before. And the most meaninful thing aws that I was able to do this with my friends at SM” he said.
None of this is particularly interesting but I'm bored and venting and there it all is. I go to work for two weeks in a row starting Monday and all I want to do is knock that out and come home and try to kill a pig.
Several countries in the region suffered continued and significant declines. Hungary, whose score deteriorated sharply in 2010, was downgraded to Partly Free to reflect the ongoing erosion of press freedom under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán. This was seen in the establishment of the National Agency for Data Protection, which will restrict access to information; evidence of a politically motivated licensing procedure that resulted in a critical radio station losing its frequencies; increased reports of censorship and self-censorship, especially at the public broadcasters; and worsening economic conditions for independent media entrepreneurship.

Just do your best to stay above the thick, heavy fog of uber-tourism, or if you're so inclined, dive head first into the fog and enjoy the heck out of your visit to Disneyland South America.

If you had told me a couple of months ago that I would no longer be blogging, I would have teared up and felt a sense of loss. But the reality is that it was time.

Some of you may have found my miracle reference to be tongue-in-cheek and yes I was having a little fun with you. However, is this blogging community not a miracle of sorts? How can it be otherwise? I do not lay my head down at night without thoughts of the faces and words I have seen each day across my comment feed. I am alone 10-12 hours a day and for months that ate at me. Since I began this process I never feel far from all of you who support my work and encourage me to persevere.

For the residents of Bogside, a Catholic, working-class neighborhood, Bloody Sunday, Jan. 30, 1972, is a day that lives in infamy. About 15,000 people were reported to have marched in an anti-internment rally that day, and 27 were shot and 14 killed when British soldiers began shooting. The museum is sited at the heart of the worst violence.

And neither did my little trip to a new friend's house today for an impromptu coffee. I smiled though i could of cried at the beauty of her period yet contemporary house. I melted in her kitchen/dining/living room. Nearly wet myself in her hallway and almost cried in her downstairs toilet....(cloakroom to all the posh people.) Her house was large, but it is never the size that appeals, more the style that gets you, don't you agree? I never saw upstairs. And i did not of course ask to take photos and publish them in my blog. Surely not on a first 'date'! Did i mention it was IMMACULATE and she has 2 kids.

To all of us for whom words are our livelihood...for all of us who believe we all have a right to freedom of speech....this is an important step for the UK. Over 60,000 people have already signed the petition which has brought the reform this far along on its path to becoming legislative reality. It is nice to know that our voices are still heard. Of course, more needs to be done to ensure that the bill isn't watered down, but this is a first step. Rather than my outlining the thought behind the need for reform here, let me direct you to the website of the Libel Reform Campaign. And to all you Brits who are not yet members of English PEN, I urge you to join. And for the rest of the world, seek out your own chapter of this crucial organisation, PEN International. Having just come back from a country where freedom of speech is being curtailed more and more every day, I have become all too aware that it is a right too easily lost.
This same lawyer introduced the late husband of Beatrix, Claus, the father of Friso, into the New York gay scene as has been published by the MSM. Claus’ homosexuality was a public secret but became a threat to public safety and the nation as such when it became obvious that the State was blackmailed as a result of Claus’ being seen and identified in the most dirty of homosexual and pedo-sexual localities.

What’s surprising about the latest release? Prices were flat nationally for the month of March 2012 and this is only the third time in the last 53 months when prices have remained flat; there have been declines in all other months since the peak in 2007. Apartment prices inDublin were actually up by 2.3% in the month following the 6.3% decline in February 2012. Non-Dublin prices are down 0.6%, perhaps the long-awaited equalizing of declines betweenDublin and elsewhere is beginning.
With her abysmal record as Mayor of Wasilla still fresh in Alaskans mind, her bid for Lt. Governor failed in 2002 but she learned from the experience. In 2005 she went back to feed from the trough of big oil money again in making her run for Governor and the rest is history. With her successful bid for Governor firmly in hand, along with most of the good old boys facing federal charges, we now had a new gang of thugs in town to take advantage of everything that Alaska has to offer. They were a prettier, better smelling version of the same old song and dance that I like to call the Corrupt Bitches Club.

Academic critics such as Mike Davis look at this campaign against relatively inconsequential crimes as not merely missing the point—graffiti does not cause people to kill people—but as part of a bigger militarization of public space, a sort of classist and racist crusade against the poor. But the results seem to speak for themselves. Crime has dropped substantially on almost all measures since the early 1990s, and continued to do so during the Great Recession of 2007-present, when one might reasonably expect economic anxieties to drive more property crimes and even violence. If Wilson’s ideas came at just the time when American society seemed to be spinning out of control, and cities were plunging into an abyss of addiction and violence, some would credit Wilson for contributing to the creation of a safer society. Did “broken windows” really work?
And will suffice.”
Naomi Replansky – Ring Song
Mullally appeared nervous when she took to the stage, not even acknowledging the audience until she'd sung two songs, possibly in case she was worried there'd be a mass bellowing of "Do Karen..!" from the Stalls. I'd had her first album for years, purloined in a divorce from a more tuneful ex, so I think I was more prepared than some in the audience. I don't think it was really fair to refer to this as the 'one-woman show' some reviewers were calling it, more 'Megan Mullally In Concert'.It would have been nice to have got more chat from her - the few thumbnail sketches of stories she threw in while she was lining up her lyrics were wonderfully blase' about including Mick Jagger and living downstairs from the woman who played the villain in 'Superman II' - but clearly she's more comfortable with a coterie of Hollywood writers around her. As would we all. These few insights were completely charming, but the juxtaposition between this quiet, almost nervy lady and the outlandish character she is more well known for was a little too much in the audience; two rows in front, some shrill queen whispered sotto voce "Is she going to sing all the way through?" I didn't hear his friend's reply, but the first responded back with a rather minty "Well I can tell you this now, we're not staying for the second act."

3.) Darkwing Duck (Volume 3) – A spin-off of the hugely popular DuckTales, Darkwing Duck didn’t take long in establishing his own fan base. Lasting 2 season with 91 episodes, the show has had a few episodes released on VHS, with full volumes sets in 2006 and 2007. The final 37 episodes that would make up a third (and possibly fourth) final release have yet to come out.

Keep Ithaca always in your mind. Arriving there is what you’re destined for. But don’t hurry the journey at all. Better if it lasts for years, so you’re old by the time you reach the island, wealthy with all you’ve gained on the way, not expecting Ithaca to make you rich.
Moskowitz did an amazing job with Wil and his feelings as he tries to find a way to bring his brother fully back to life. While reading there were times I wanted to cry. I could feel Wil's frustration and heartbreak as everything he tries fails. She also shows Wil, who has already obviously had to deal with the trauma of his brother dying, maturing even more as he has to deal with the consequences of his actions and his brother wanting to die all over again.

Typical 16-year-old Darren (Chris Massoglia) hung out with his best friend Steve (Josh Hutcherson), got decent grades, and usually stayed out of trouble. But when he and Steve stumble upon a traveling freak show, Steve recognizes one of the performers as a vampire. After the police shut down the show, Darren and Steve get separated. Steve goes to the vampire Larten Crepsley (John C. Reilly) and tries to convince him to make Steve into a vampire. Darren went to steal Crepsley's poisonous spider Madam Octa, and overhears the conversation between Crepsley and Steve. Crepsley says Steve has bad blood and refuses to turn him into a vampire. Steve swears to kill Crepsley and leaves.

Lately, I found out about another “division” of fans which I think it has a very high level of disturbance, called “sasaeng fans”. I haven’t known much about this type but from what I know these people has been really literally idolizing their idol or even more. This type of fans are scary. From what I read online and saw in youtube, those sasaeng fans has no life other than stalking and “enjoying” the life of the idols. They are like the detectives that stalk and intrude the personal life of their idols, some things are really inappropriate even violate the laws.

But once you get down it the bare, unvarnished truth of it all, doesn't it just go to show you just how far we've plunged into an oversensitized bruised feelings consciousness when a piece such as "The Talk; Nonblack Version" is somehow considered a racist pile of trash to be placed alongside THE KLANSMAN and HUCKLEBERRY FINN (!) while more glaring problems involving race relations are convienently swept under the rug, with excuses for bad groupthink behavior being made left and right by people whom I have the sneaking suspicion avoid blacks even more than they think so-called "conservatives" do? Maybe the reality of it all doesn't quite fit the kumbaya mantra we've been having shoved down our throats these past forty years, but then again did anybody really believe all of those vague notions about brotherhood that have been tossed at us by hippie teachers and socially-conscious parents? Even in today's supposedly "post-racial" (hah!) Ameriga things seem even more tense and suspicious than they did when I was growing up amidst the cacophony of unrest! And you can be we have our witless "benefactors" (teachers, parents, media spokesmen) to thank for that!

When I first saw this film I was about 10 so it made absolutely no sense but when I watched it a bit older at 16 I thought it was one of the best Sci-Fi films I had ever seen, didn’t matter that the visuals where a bit weird or some scenes were absurdly funny when it should be serious I still just loved watching it. In Paul Verhoeven’s wild sci-fi action movie Total Recall, Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a 21st-century construction worker who discovers that his entire memory of the past derives from a memory chip implanted in his brain. Schwarzenegger learns that he’s actually a secret agent who had become a threat to the government, so those in power planted the chip and invented a domestic lifestyle for him.

Glycowithanolides, consisting of equimolar concentrations of sitoindosides VII-X and withaferin A, isolated from the roots of Withania somnifera Dunal, have been reported to have an antioxidant effect in the rat brain frontal cortex and striatum. In the present study, the effect of 10 days of oral administration of these active principles, in graded doses (10, 20 and 50 mg/kg), was noted on iron overload (FeSo(4), 30 mg/kg, i.p.) induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Apart from hepatic lipid peroxidation (LPO), the serum enzymes, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase, were assessed as indices of hepatotoxicity. Silymarin (20 mg/kg, p.o.) was used for comparison. Iron overload induced marked increase in hepatic LPO and serum levels of the enzymes, which was attenuated by WSG in a dose-related manner, and by silymarin. The results indicate that the reported use of WS in Ayurveda for hepatoprotection against heavy metals and other environmental toxins, may be due the antioxidant action of WSG.

More important still is that a pro-growth strategy could help reverse California’s current feudalization. The same Public Policy Institute of California study shows that during the last broad-based economic boom, between 1993 and 2001, the 10th percentile of earners enjoyed stronger income growth than earners in the higher percentiles did. The lesson, which progressives once understood, is that upward mobility is best served by a growing economy. If they fail to remember that all-important fact, the greens and their progressive allies may soon have to place the California dream on their list of endangered species.

The real purpose of that part of the theory anyway is to eliminate the need to screen out the Disneyland tags. With it, the queue switchbacks, the front plaques, and anything else that points to Disneyland and not New Orleans can be taken as intended parts of the show rather than concessions to the real-world necessities involved in creating an attraction of this nature. For my part, I think that the general public is quite capable of screening out such noise when they know they are in an entertainment venue. At Disneyland (or any theme park) you have to screen out gobs and gobs of stuff in order to enjoy an immersion experience, and people do it without effort. I see no reason why the Haunted Mansion has to be noticeably freer of such static than other rides.

Perhaps for minds of appropriate degrees of subtle awareness and relevant experience, a large portion of the truth may be invoked by words via the imagination. And perhaps this invocation may lead either to further, more personalized symbolic systems in the mind of the hearer, and perhaps it may inspire the hearer to enter a state largely (or totally?) beyond imagination, beyond symbols and constructions, to rest on aspects of the truth to which the words may have been intended to refer, though never displaying directly (for it is beyond the capacity of words to do so, due to their symbolic nature*).
Miles 6-10: It was time to quit my bitching and run this race the way I went to Madrid to run this race. From this point to Mile 10, I was so focused on just racing that everything was pretty much a blur. I know that these miles were down a pretty narrow street and the spectators were overtaking the race course a little bit but I was focused and I was running and I was on pace and I felt great. There were so few women on the course that every time I ran past women spectators, they went crazy cheering for me yelling "Va campeona! Va Va Va!" Champion? Why yes, I do feel like a champion, thank you!

Proverbs 4: 22-27 says: My son, pay attention to what I say; turn your ear to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart; for they are life to those who find them and health to one’s whole body. Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it. Keep your mouth free of perversity; keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Let your eyes look straight ahead; fix your gaze directly before you. Give careful thought to the paths for your feet and be steadfast in all your ways. Do not turn to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.

Are some buyers missing out because a property is distressed? Absolutely! A distressed property is a term often used to describe a short sale (pre-foreclosure) or bank owned (foreclosed) property. A short sale requires negotiations with multiple parties – not just the home owner but also the lien holder(s). This can be a long and involved process and although it may appear to be “a deal”, in the long run…it may not be as there could be unknown liens (think unpaid special assessment for condos), unpaid real estate taxes, deferred maintenance issues, etc. It is best to use a short sale attorney to help navigate you through this process and make sure that you will not be held responsible for more than what you expect. Short sales and REOs (bank owned properties) can be a wonderful opportunity if you are patient, willing to take on some remodeling projects and understand that at the end of the day, it will be the bank or investor making the final decision on sale price. If you don’t agree with the price, you can walk away but the time you invested in this process may mean that you missed out on a “regular” home purchase.

The windows lining the lobby of my building streamed past me and in a singular moment everything stopped. The light from the morning twilight caught my eye and I wondered why I was even fighting. Maybe this was my salvation from who knows how many countless more mornings leading to only dull days full of people who would sell their own mother for a chance at fame or a better car or the new I-anything. Maybe in some horrific monstrous way, this thing was choosing to help me in the only way it knew how, savagely tearing me limb from limb. But this moment of deep introspection was quickly over taken by my human instinct to keep living, suck as many hours of life out of this world as you can. You can never have enough time to troll the Internet or cheat on your partner or tweet how much you hate waiting on line at the DMV. So I ran and I kept running, past the windows to the middle of my lobby, through the first door, down another flight of stairs and out into the open air.

I was going to bring Hemet Nesingwary along with me, but he was having a good old time messing with some random scrubs who were hanging around out there – people keep coming to him wanting to prove what great outdoorsmen they are, and so he just makes up random stuff to have them go kill and see how quick they eat up the chance to waste their time on pointless shit. Like seriously, you should see how many people just jump at the chance to burn up their whole day killing random animals that absolutely anyone with a sword could kill, because they actually believe that killing a bunch of talbuk that are standing around RIGHT THERE is the way to impress Hemet Fucking Nesingwary.

For the ministers that I have worked for, all of them have underlined the importance of their responsibilities to MPs. One of the key conventions of our Parliamentary democracy is that MPs are able to hold ministers to account on behalf of their constituents.

Someone from the show then called me up sometime in November 2010, asking if he could come over and have a talk with me. I was overly excited and already imagined us jetting off…but no.

I told them that I was going to meet my sister in Paris that December and they asked if they could give us a camera to shoot our encounter. You know, just in case they would choose us.

He imagined she had run off and was hiding on him somewhere in the forest. The moon had long since set making it almost impossible for him to see. Ever fiber of his being was screaming for another hit. The vein in his arm where he liked to inject himself pulsed like it was begging for more. He scratched at it trying to ease the sensation. Coming down for him was like having his nerve endings hooked into an amplifier then jacking the volume up to eleven, it was blaringly painful.

I'm not going to write on essay on whether or not young celebrities should be getting plastic surgery because I'm sure they all have their reasons and/or body dysmorphic disorder (ahem, HEIDI) which in that case I truly do feel sorry for them. I'm certainly not opposed to getting some botox here and there if needed in a few years down the road or maybe even an eye or face lift when I become droopy at an older age. (Hey, I do some acting on television and film so can you blame me if I want to look a few years younger when I'm 45?). But when I came across the pic of twenty four year-old, beautiful as-is Megan Fox the other day when I was scrolling through my favorite, guilty-pleasure tabloid website TMZ, it made me think: If these young celebrities are getting plastic surgery now, what are they going to look like in 10, 20, 30 years from now? Here's a preview below.

It’s been a while since I’ve quoted Atlas Shrugged. Now I realize this is a very long quote so I’ll give a summary up front. “Show me how someone views sex and how they view the sex they are attracted to and I’ll tell you everything you need to know about that person. Someone who hates sex hates themselves. Someone who seeks the bimbo hates themselves. Show me a man who hates women for being women, or a woman who hates men for being men and I will show you self-loathing of untold depth. Show me someone who hates sex or loves bimbos and I will show you someone who can’t be trusted.”
This is wrong on so many levels, first off, Fash the Bash is not shouting Aruba but AWOOGA and secondly, the island is popular with Americans who have never seen UK "Gladiators" and even if you did, would a retired football player shouting the word at you really be the deal breaker in spending an awful lot of cash on going there?

There is just a tiny handful of students in my classes who will need to boost scores in the last six weeks to be certain to pass the semester, but I’m happy to see parents almost any time. I may not be able to stay for the entire evening, but please check in if you’re here. Bonus points for students whose parents check in, as always.

Of course, the folklore of the South has been incorporated into many plays as well and that brings us (finally!) to a new play that has just opened in Chicago. At its heart, Bekah Brunstetter’s Take Her to See the Maco Lights revolves around the Maco Light, a spectral light seen near Maco, North Carolina. According to the notice on Broadway World.com, the play “follows a pair of young lovers along

“Did you know that barns are for storing crops, which are a type of plant?” replied Tybalt. “Crops are made of carbon and hydrogen and oxygen and nitrogen, which are all bits you can find in the Periodic Table, which is not a real table like a dining room table or a bedside table or even a coffee table.”

By devaluing the purpose of marriage, to the point that it is now often merely some slushy celebration of sentimental feelings, society is left with a very truncated understanding of human nature as well as what wedlock's real purpose. Since the liberalisation of sex following the trauma of the Second World War, and especially since the contraceptive revolution that soon followed, our western understanding of marriage has been radically damaged. It is no longer primarily for the procreation and education of children, or even a commitment between a man and a woman ‘for better or for worse’. Rather, it seems to have become ‘castrated’ – concerned primarily with the feelings that exist between the couple in love, as opposed to the supporting of family life and the welfare of children. These feelings (be they based in 'love' or 'lust') between married couples often come to an end, leading - in the modern world - to the collapse of their individual marriages.
In the beginning, Florya enters the forest after he is left behind by the partisans. He meets up with a young woman named Glasha who happens to be in love with the partisan commander. As they return to their village, they become embroiled in a German paratrooper offensive. Florya becomes temporarily deaf after he is almost hit by artillery fire. But no matter, they make it back to Florya’s suddenly empty house. Florya suggests that they go to a nearby island in the middle of a bog where they might be hiding. But Glasha looks back and sees that his whole family had been shot behind their house. Florya, now in denial, plunges the two of them into the bog in one of the film’s most memorable scenes. Almost drowning, they desperately swim across the bog. The mud and water dirties them. Could this be an allusion to Florya’s lost innocence? Probably. As soon as they get across the bog and onto the island, they run into the remnants of their village who tell him that his family had been killed.

In the early Georgian era, Bath was second only to London as a destination for the rich and titled; many of the aristocracy spent the winter in London and the summer in Bath.
Rimstead is highly critical of anti-theorists who do not suggest alternatives to theory; although she may support Christian’s position of “theorize, not theories”, it may not be sufficiently prescriptive (Rimstead 203, Christian 2135). Christian’s belief in intertextuality as information as a way of preventing the solidifying of theory within a movement may not be satisfactory, either. Kaplan suggests that non-literary sources may be of value, as well, an idea that Zandy made into an anthology (Rimstead 209, 211). The anthology is similar to one I found recently, called Out of the Class Closet: Lesbians Speak. There are some essays and poems in this anthology, but also interviews that were recorded and then transcribed as well as photos and other non-literary sources contributed by working class lesbians.

“Sometimes, it’s not so wise to be open-minded,” the priest answered. He’d already berated me for missing Mass. I began the process of leaving the Church not long after that, but I’ve made my peace with all of it by now. I would even say at this point my memories of my Catholic girlhood are mostly fond ones, and even now I miss the superhero quality of Confession – the slipping into a tiny, dark booth, the whispered instructions, the quick change from sinner to blessed one, the secrecy and the mystery. Never again will I have the giddy thrill of feeling as sparkling and clean as a diamond, and wonderfully new….if only for an hour.

The other part is the confusion, frustration, and even anger at Obama for not selling the positive accomplishments that his administration has accomplished in the face of the GOP assault and the mess that Bush’s failures have littered his presidential path with. There’s also the anger at him from the throng of progressive and liberal Democrats for not hitting, and hitting back hard ala Truman and FDR at the GOP’s bullying, badgering and hectoring. The term that was once heard in only the faintest of whispers “cave” in in regards to his policy compromises with the GOP has now progressed to a roar. The latest being the compromise agreement to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. Even though his back was to the wall and there were pluses in the compromise—unemployment extension, social security tax cuts, and cuts for small business— the president will be endlessly reminded he broke his cornerstone campaign promise that he would not back the tax cut extension for the rich. That’s now ancient history.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x8 square baking dish. Combine the black beans, eggs, oil, cocoa powder, salt, vanilla extract and sugar in a blender; blend until smooth; pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish. Sprinkle the chocolate chips over the top of the mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges start to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes.

But here’s the thing: the angles, timing, swing, and speed don’t always work the way you think they will. Sometimes, when you slice one way, your object collapses the opposite way. Or your maneuver to get two pieces to collide when one is descending faster than the other which is perched on a ledge with no discernible way to reach the oncoming object leaves you dizzy and totally perplexed. How many times do you try it the way you think it should work before you realize you have to recalculate and devise a different theory?
So to answer your question, the main characteristic of ME, the abnormally delayed muscle recovery after doing trivial things is essential in any ME research, just like a broken bone is essential if you do research into broken bones. If you do research into broken bones with people who don't have a broken bone, but say they do, then your research is obviously seriously flawed to put it mildly. And the same applies to ME research on patients who don't have (the abnormally delayed muscle recovery after doing trivial things, the main characteristic of) ME.

This was my first John Carpenter movie, and I was pretty underwhelmed. Everyone has a different definition of good silly and bad silly, and I'm afraid that this was bad silly for me. The undeniable charisma of Kurt Russell is a strong point, but mostly it felt like an 80s arcade game with some arcane depictions of women and Asians. I didn't give up on Carpenter, however, and discovered that The Thing (1982) was much more on my wavelength.

Likewise in the picture below, the leaves and branches look unfocused and blurred, while the waterfall in the background is clear and crisp. Like Sara Rosso (the challenge photographer), I kept these pictures as a testament to the fun my mother and I had – a physical reminder of our trip. I like them even more for their being partially “unfocused”: I am given the opportunity to see the same site from two different perspectives, and appreciate it all the more.

A photocopier is generally used to make copies of documents quickly and cheaply. It is mainly used in schools, colleges, offices, and businesses. There are two types of photocopiers- analog and digital copiers. Analog copiers work on the old and traditional Xerox process to make copies through a positively charged drum and paper, and negatively charged toner. Now days, digital copy machines are widely in use due to their several advantages. These copiers employ a negatively charged drum and paper, and positively charged toner.
Readers of the Healthymemory Blog might regard this as a contradiction of the one of the premises of the blog that technology can results in increases in brain health. There is no real contradiction here. Whether technology is helpful or harmful depends on how technology is used. When one considers the potential of future technology, for example, the translation of written and spoken foreign languages, there is the possibility that we could become mental weaklings all too dependent on this technology. One can find a ready analogy to physical fitness where some of us are obese and/or in poor physical condition due to the many options in transportation that technology offers as well as the many options in sedentary entertainment.

Cannibalism is also common to the histories of both the Kombai and the Korowai. For the Kombai, it is apparently a form of tribal punishment, with only men identified as witches killed and eaten by the community in retribution for the souls devoured by the accused. Cannibalism is steeped in similarly supernatural belief for the Korowai and may also have been practiced as part of their criminal justice system. It seems these tree dwellers do not believe in natural death, but death caused by sorcery – also believed to be a cause of inter-clan warfare.
As a toddler, she’s in a head-start program. Skip ahead to 17, and she’s enrolled at a Race to the Top high school. Her 20s are very active: She gets surgery and free birth control through ObamaCare regulations, files a lawsuit under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, and pays off her student loans at a low interest rate. We get updates at age 31, 37 and 42–and then the narrative skips ahead 23 years when she enrolls in Medicare. Two years later, she’s on Social Security, at which point she can die at any time.

My Sunday's always used to be punctuated by listening to The Archers Omnibus at 10 am on Radio 4. But I'm aware over the last quite a long time this hasn't happened. I'm not entirely sure why. Maybe it's the self-indulgence I have of a predilection for staying in bed whilst listening for a full one and a quarter hours, or maybe I just haven't had the time. Well today I thought that would be redressed and, while Mountain Man went off on a Borders Search and Rescue exercise, I put the radio on, but instead of staying in my pit, I got the ironing board out and 'enjoyed' some domestic bliss.

This top was a gift from Sal, and it wasn't until after she left that I realized how perfectly it matches my favorite, most comfy pair of pants. I wore this outfit to go to an appointment with my tax guy, during which I discovered that the tax laws are even more confusing and nonsensical than I had previously thought. I guess that's why I don't do my taxes myself.

at Worth Abbey and School. The Federation of Children's Book Groups is an excellent organisation and all Sassies ought to be aware of it. Several Sassies were there this year: Linda Newbery, who was a speaker, Anne Cassidy, who's already written about it, and Damian Harvey who was there with his lovely youngest daughter, Deanna.
Sian has apparently been going out with this guy, but they have apparently split up, and she’s a bit sad about that. I reckon that is probably an understatement to be honest. I did see her on her own a fair bit more than usual tonight, and she was on her own texting people a lot. I didn’t really speak to her all that much tonight, but she did wave goodbye to me at the end of the night, which she never has done before :)

Well let me say this Londoners...suck it up. I feel no sympathy for you at all. When I was a 19 year old squaddie in a platoon of 30 facing 10,000 rampaging, looting, violently murderous black people or, to be culturally correct, the underprivileged, who would quite happily chop me into little pieces with their panga's (machete's), YOU were campaigning for their equal rights. YOU were imposing sanctions on us. YOU were screaming how they were equal on the social ladder and YOU were telling us how ALL men are equal.

In reading "Poetry of the 1930s" one is struck by two things - the lack of women poets; and the specificity of the poetry chosen. Auden, a poet who wrote well for longer than most, is reduced by his appearance here, Spender and others are possibly improved. Yet as we not only live longer, but our public writers have longer public lives, I think we would be wrong to dismiss this "generational" sense. There are gaps in the record. The various Millennium anthologies (Bloodaxe, Penguin, The Firebox) close with poets younger than myself. Yet you would think my generation be poets of the "nineties" if at all? Possibly things take longer now. The Next Generation list published in 2004, included quite a few poets born in the 50s and early 60s as well as the late 60s and early 70s; Alice Oswald, I was surprised to see, being about the closest in age. (I'd probably thought her younger if anything.) It does seem to me difficult to imagine a poet who had been a teenager when the Beatles were still together, (as Jane Draycott and Pascale Petit were), being classed as the same "generation" - anymore than writers much younger than me who had debut pamphlets in 2010 as a generation that I belong to.

My next article was headed “An Apology,” and in it I stated the circumstances which had called it out, and the pleasant prospect of my being sent to Mount Airy (our county jail) in case this, my apology, was not satisfactory. I should of course do my best to satisfy his honor, but in case of failure, should take comfort in the fact that the Mount would make a good observatory. From that height I should be able to use my telescope much better than in my present valley of humiliation. Indeed, the mere prospect had so improved my glass, that I had caught a new view of our sunken star, and to-day, this dispenser of justice, this gentleman with the high sense of honor, was a criminal under sentence of death by the divine law.

I busied myself with cooking and it was almost ready when your daddy arrived. He didn't come inside. I spoke to him,wondering why he didn't come in the house as usual. In minutes, Mom passed by the kitchen window, had arrived from around the back yard by herself. I noticed and wondered but didn't think much about it. They then came inside. I could tell your daddy was pretty upset but he didn't say a word. Then Mom proceeded to tell me that Tom Haney, your daddy's boss was dead. Just a couple hours before this, work on mowing the greens of the golf course was finished. Tom was talking and demonstrating to his men a very large and new mower just recently acquired and warning them of the dangers using it on the hillsides. Tom was the only man that used it up to that time.
Chuck in some flavouring agents. I like to use plenty of dill and lemony herbs like sumac and lemon myrtle, and some chopped spring onions. But perhaps some fresh basil and garlic might suit your fancy better. I usually like to make it fairly mild, and then add some chutney or sauce to taste at serving time. You can add other little bits and pieces of stuff for an accent - leftover antipasti, a handful of pitted and halved olives, some chopped sun-dried tomatoes or roast capsicum. If you're not cooking for a vegetarian, some chopped ham or cooked bacon pieces could well go in.

The BF Goodrich brand has distinguished itself by its pioneering spirit, and by its desire to extend the limits of performance. This attitude has resulted in many important advances in tyre development. In 1870 Dr Benjamin Franklin Goodrich created the first North America rubber company and it was from here that many important events have marked history. In 1903 the first car to cross the United States was fitted with BF Goodrich tyres and in 1915 BF Goodrich became the first North American Tyre brand to win the Indianapolis 500 in two consecutive years. It was from these beginnings that many firsts were borne; BF Goodrich was the first to manufacture a tubeless tyre for American cars in 1947 and in 1967 launched the first run flat tyre.

However, instead of being the end, this is the point where it becomes complex, the start of painting the sky. The problem is a simple one, I need to make up most of the sky, blending several photos adding and subtracting bits, mixing colours that are different gradations from several photos to create a unified looking painting. Adjusting the painting's composition as I work my way from top to bottom, hoping that I'll get the gradations right and somehow get it all to work?

Now he granted Valeria a sliver of that admiring stare. It was not enough to diminish his deep feelings for the red-head that had stolen his heart before he knew how to love. However, he acknowledged the strength and courage of the seer with a little smile, who met his gaze unfaltering. It was not her place to make demands. Neither her magic nor her birth granted her that right, and what independence she might have had got lost when she accepted the proposal.
I do live remotely, as I have for many years.

This world of the netherlands, of nature herself, and everything under her domain, is a constantly remarkable revelation.

People are excited to hear about your engagement and are only asking about the wedding details to show their interest. It’s most likely not a way to “score” an invite.
This kind of approach needs to be leveled with teasing YET with flirting so that it’s not a weird or awkward transition to later ask her for the digits. IOW’s the playful banter/teasing needs to always have a foundation in showing an intimate interest and need to move to the next level. Basically, there should be no surprises when you go from cracking a joke and she’s in tears laughing and just as she is catching her breathe from laughing so hard you drop the hammer and ask for her number and she’s like “WTF?”.

Being a plus size woman, what you would look forward would be to get a right fitting prom dress. It is the most sensible choice and also would help a lot more for you in the long run. Never go for too tight or too loose dress as they would bring in just the opposite effect. Online shopping is the best way to find a perfect plus size dress since there would be ample variety of designs. At online, there are infinite choices of prom dresses that would be custom fitted for your physique.
I know this because I tasted just a little sliver of one layer (gotta stick to my resolutions) and then took the rest to work.
I’ve heard an expression: “Some people are so heavenly-minded, they are no earthly good.” I detest that expression. It is entirely false. I have never met anyone who is too heavenly-minded. And the most resurrection-oriented people I know are the ones who have done the most for the Lord and for their fellow human beings here and now. It is only when we lost sight of resurrection that we become focused on making ourselves happy here and now, whatever the cost.
We do stir fry dishes in our house maybe once a week or twice. I pull out the wok and make some brown rice or sushi rice (or for my husband who doesn’t eat rice or pasta, lettuce shredded). Grab some organic chicken breasts and slice it up small. Whatever organic veggies you have on hand will work! Gluten free soy sauce and gluten free terriyaki sauce assist with the flavoring. Not hard at all. I’d post a recipe, but not sure people are interested, message me if you are!

You visibility and impression play into the probability of an encounter as well. Common sense dictates if your tribe is highly visible and gives the impression that your little rural community is doing extremely well after the SHTF you’ll be a much more likely target. Especially if you seem like a soft target (one that is barely defended or disorganized). This is where OPSEC is critical and you need the understanding among all of the Tribe members that information in any way shape or form about your tribe shouldn’t be discussed outside of the tribe and it’s members at all. The slightest slip could put you on the radar – think about what would happen if a starving band of heavily armed gangbangers finds out you’re fat dumb and happy when the urban jungle isn’t giving them what they need? Bad juju there.

As a non-gardener, I couldn’t help giggling at a tiny stand of flower pots for sale when we stopped by the University of British Columbia’s Botanical Garden Shop, during a bike ride last month. One of the pots had a garden ceramic sign emblazoned: Grow, damn it! Do expert gardeners lose their patience too?
Something to Live For (30) – Complete FALL FROM GRACE
NOTE: God deals harsher with those who know better
So, right now, letting go is something I'm having to do many times each day. It's not a one step process. It's continual. I let go, I feel good about this, I feel freer and then a little while later I realise I'm holding on tight again to a memory or a feeling or a set of thoughts. It seems to be a process that takes time, patience, constant reminders, some struggle, and discipline.

And now, to return to our little food world, I made this Polynesian Pork Roast the other day and it was delicious. I found the recipe in Canadian Living and I liked all these beautiful ingredients that were used and so I decided to make it. It was sweet and sour and coconut left a beautiful after taste in your mouth. I loved it and put it in my recipe pile. In parenthesis I will give you the original ingredients, as I made some necessary substitutions due to lack of specific ingredients. I totally recommend it!
It’s not just chicken growers who face constrained markets, Mr. Lynn writes. In free-wheeling Silicon Valley, computer engineers and digital animation workers employed by Apple, Google, Intel, and Pixar, among others, were subject to a secret agreement not to bid on each others’ employees, according to a Justice Department lawsuit filed, and settled, in 2010. (On Friday, former employees of some of the companies filed an antitrust lawsuit in federal court in San Jose based on the Justice Department investigation.)
Whenever you add the word “just” before something else, you’re belittling whatever comes next. ”I’m just a kid,” “I was just kidding,” “I’m just a volunteer,” etc. This is also why I hate the line “…just the sheep of his hand” in the popular worship song, “Come Let us Worship and Bow Down.” Using the word “just” will automatically devalue whatever follows.
A week ago we had a flood. This is not something that we planned for or worried about when we went to bed. We have a sump pump. It saves us ALL of the time. But this time was different. There was a power outage with a HUGE storm that had an ENORMOUS amount of rain fall. This was happening at 1:00 to 4:00 in the morning while our family was fast asleep. It was only a matter of time before water would begin seeping up from the ground into our basement. And all while we slept only a few feet above it. Our little one woke up from the storm around 3:30 a.m, and when we hopped out of bed to help him to the bathroom, we splish splashed in the dark through our entire lower level. We still had no power and used the lights from our cell phones to find our way. After getting our little guy back to bed, we stood there wondering what to do. It was the middle of the night. There was no power. We felt helpless.....

Listening is pretty darn important. One of my classroom expectations is to be a good listener. Every once in a while I get a class that is soooo chatty (some might say disrespectful) that we have to take a time out from the project and do a different kind of lesson based on listening.
There’s a longer piece on page 4 which discusses the politics of class war under the subheading ‘Angry and Proud and which notes that it is a ‘working class revolutionary organisation’. It states:

If you look at the combination of attacks on our terms & conditions, the constant media drip-feed of pantomime villain police stories, our apparent replacement by PCSO’s or private guards, the current labelling of all police officers as racist bandwagon and now yet another thing we can go to jail for (chasing criminals and rushing to emergencies) I really wonder if someone is trying to stop us doing our job.

This month I cast aside Dean Koontz' 77 Shadow Street (as did a colleague of mine!), due to its overzealous descriptions. Halfway through the book and the same 5 minutes are still taking place (slight exaggeration). I've always loved Koontz, being a dedicated horror/suspense fan.

As for the other, unflattering common name, stinking Benjamin(!), the flower evidently has a fowl odor that attracts flies as pollinators. Red trillium has been used as an herbal medicine. It is reported to have antiseptic and astringent qualities and was used for the treatment of illnesses as far-reaching as gangrene, bleeding, and snakebites.
Easter Monday provided a more local opportunity to go for Ring Ouzel, since a male had been found in the grounds of a country-house-turned-conference-centre near Bracknell. There was plenty of quiet lawn on which the bird should have been hoppping about, but in blustery conditions I couldn’t relocate it. There was another Treecreeper though, and a calling Little Owl.

However, no matter how far into separateness we fall, in a sense it’s never more than superficial. No matter how strong the ego becomes, it’s never more than a construct. Everyone experiences moments when separateness temporarily fades, and we become part of the unity again. These are what I refer to as ‘awakening experiences.’ They frequently occur when we’re walking amongst natural surroundings, when we’re dancing or running, during or after sex, listening to or playing music. In these situations, the normal chattering of the ego – which is the normal fuel of the ego, maintaining it as a structure – becomes quiet, leading to a softening of its boundaries. Separateness dissolves and we’re afloat on the ocean of Being again, immersed in the glorious is-ness and aliveness of the world.
You would think he would pick up that what he was doing was a bad idea, right? I mean dead bodies are everywhere, people are crying, and it was all over intermarriage, which he was boldy doing in front of them. When the priest Phinehas saw this, he picked up a spear, ran into the tent, and pierced through both the man and woman.
We packed up the van with clothes, swim gear and snacks and headed out for the five hour drive (with stopping for lunch) to St. Louis. We've been there twice before, in 1997 and again in 2008...it's amazing that all three times we have found new things to do and there's still more that we haven't gotten to yet!

I have insanely sensitive eyes but a girl just wants a little definition. It took years of trying all kinds of eye liners touting “hypoallergenic, all-natural minerals, yada-yada” (and some seriously itchy, red, and even swollen peepers) to finally find Mineral Fusion eye pencil in coal (black). I happened to picked it up in my local Whole Foods on a whim (kept my receipt of course). And, by george, it works! It’s apparently formulated with chamomile, meadowfoam and vitamin E to soothe delicate skin around eyes and it’s free of gluten, paragons, artificial colors, fragrances and talc. But I think the real trick is that it actually stays put and doesn’t end up running into your eyes at the end of the work day or night on the town. Miracles do happen. Buy it now.

I detest Hillary Clinton's politics, but I have a grudging admiration for her. She is smart and she is a hard worker. I have known a few Colonels over the years, all conservative, who had substantive interactions with Ms. Clinton. Every one said she was personable, warm and in complete command of the facts.

Next I heft a stack of magazines, and sometimes old books and calendars, to my bedroom, most of which I choose randomly, but with my themes in mind I might deliberately pick some types that will be more likely to contain related images. I then try to stick to only the stack I've chosen, although at the end of the process, if there's a gap in the collage that needs filling by something of a particular color or size, I might go look at a few others. I didn't have to do that this time, though.
This little table is in our kitchen and I want to paint it but I can’t decide what color! I love light and bright white to patch our window mirrors and TV stand, but white is also boring so I don’t know! Dan probably wouldn’t go for a bright crazy color because it doesn’t “match”…so any ideas??
Long before I had ever owned a vibrator, I discovered that there were several common household items that suit that need just fine. Totally by fluke actually. I was steam cleaning my carpets and was tangled up in the water hose, the suction hose and the electrical cord. Trying to sort my way out of this mess, I placed the suction hose between my thighs and squeezed so that I could use my hands to work on the other cords. A few seconds into it, I was “Huh? What the…”. A minute goes by and I’m less interested in the stupid cords and just trying to keep my breath even while the humming vibrations drive me bonkers. Seconds later I am half-gripping, half-sliding-down the walls in “Oh my GOD” astonishment.

When you are always serving, your cup will always be empty. When you do not accept the service of others, you will have nothing to give to others it’s inevitable that you will crash and burn. On the other hand, when you are willing to let others serve you and you do not serve others yourself, your cup will be overflowing and the excess will go to waste. It does not take much effort to serve others generally. There are times when it’s truly a sacrifice to serve others.
On the Transabled.org website Chloe describes his dream of becoming genuinely disabled as a form of “transition”. His partner Danielle aka Alicia (because just one fake persona is never enough apparently) posts in the same thread to a guy who describes seeking a back alley surgeon that will “snip” his spine: “Much support to you as you move towards authenticity!”- using the identical language adopted by the transgenderist movement.

Any talk of a "comprehensive" republican approach should be shunned. If we didn't want a 2,700 page monstrosity from the left, why in heaven's name would we want the same from the right? Small, targeted bills that address health insurance issues point by point are the way to go, not colossal, byzantine laws that will require judicial intervention to interpret.

Ironically (for those that know me) the plane that would be whisking me to new surroundings was decked out in F1 livery.

The author portrays the believable characters as complex and knowledgeable in their various professional fields, specifically Glyn’s scientific background and Kath’s sister, Elaine, a highly accomplished and sought-after gardening specialist.

Readers selfishly expect to consume news stories for free and when asked if they are willing to pay for them, they couch their negative responses in the guise of tropes taken from the era of civil protest. "The people," they say, will decide. But what they don't see - because newspaper companies don't routinely talk to the people about their economic fortunes publicly - is that the media is suffering. Those news stories that you rely on for information are becoming a rare commodity. You may not like journalists, or you may not like tabloid newspapers, but if those vehicles for content disappear the society you live in will change for good.

The best poem I ever wrote, no contest, is the one I wrote for Ronnie for Mother’s Day 2009. She inspires me. From the very beginning of our relationship to this point, more than a quarter of a century later, she is my muse in every aspect of life, not just poetry.
The first half of Beautiful Disaster is wonderful. It is fast-paced, intriguing, and everything else that a superb novel should be. The reader is introduced to a cast of characters that are both complex and lovable while keeping the reader curious about their motives in relationships. The relationship between Travis and Abby is, at first, what keeps the novel from becoming just another one of "those" books where the girl meets the bad boy and forgets any standards that she ever had. The fact that Abby is able to keep her standards and stand up for herself for the majority of the novel may be one of the best things about it. Another thing that makes Beautiful Disaster good is the unique setting - The Circle at Eastern University, where secret fights happen. This certainly adds intrigue and tension to the overall novel.

Hunter is anything but boring; she has an awesome imagination and a fabulous sense of humor! Her real name is Cynthia Tillery Hodges and she lives in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina with three men and a lady. The men; her husband and her two canine pals, Des and Fletch. The lady; a cat named Bessie. When she isn’t writing, she spends her time gardening, reading, and researching the legends of her Cherokee ancestors. She is a member of North Carolina Writers’ Network and High Country Writers. Currently, she and her sister, Christy Tillery French, are co-authoring a book about their great-aunt’s life growing up in the small town of Hot Springs, NC. Caitlyn writes romantic mysteries—some sweet, some erotic–but she also writes children’s books (as yet unsubmitted). She has several e-books to her credit and her first print book, Snow Shadows, a sensual paranormal romance. It’s first in the Eternal Shadows series, with the sequel, Storm Shadows, due for release soon. In addition, Winds of Fate, based on the legend of Blowing Rock in North Carolina is also due out soon.

You notice that I haven’t mentioned sexual abstinence. This is because I’ve never been sure that monks were celibate after seeing The Name of the Rose. The movie has a scene where an apprentice monk played by Christian Slater loses his virginity to an incredibly sensual peasant girl who wears no underwear. It’s not clear what she was doing in the monastery, but she was never made to feel unwelcome until the Inquisition turned up and denounced her as a witch. There’s always a party pooper who wants to spoil the fun.

Things get off to an auspicious start with "Turn Down The Sound" (reverse psychology?) - eerie vocals and an ominous bass-line before the vamping organ drops into the mix; a simple snare and hi-hat provide the forward momentum. It's clear from the get-go that, like his bio says, Adrian Younge"has dedicated his life to the study of classic soul music" - this and so many of the other tracks on the album sound like something Numero Group or Light In The Attic might have unearthed. "Anna May" even dips further back in time to doo-wop and those lovely "ooo-oooh baby" refrains. "Lovely Lady" even pulls out the "she-bop-she-bop" stop before Dennis Coffey dazzles with his legendary licks.

They were no doubt totally stressed - but they let us do it. We had an adventure.
It wasn’t until the end of the Edo period 1868 that decorative tattooing really flourished. Mythical creatures like dragrons and ferocious tigers were popular.
