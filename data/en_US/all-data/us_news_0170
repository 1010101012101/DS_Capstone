Yet today we're going on Day 15. That poor bird(s) keeps flinging itself at the glass. What, put stickers on the windows? I could, but that would involve the entire house. And for what it's worth, I've watched this guy, when not engaged in full frontal assault on our fenestration, he pauses to pick up worms from the wet pavement casually snacking between hits. He seems perfectly fine.
The database, which anyone can update, was online less than 24 hours after the quake struck, with more than 6,000 entries because Schwartz and his colleagues wrote a "scraper" that gathered data from a Red Cross site.

One team leader says the themes in the Texans' locker room Wednesday, the next time the team faces the media to talk about Sunday's game, will be how dangerous the Colts are without Manning, how it wouldn't surprise anyone if Manning showed up to play, and how on any given Sunday Jamie Foxx can lead a pro football team to glory.

That's what's happening in South Carolina, where a barrage of attack ads from a super PAC supporting Newt Gingrich — and largely bankrolled by one wealthy supporter — has brought the former House speaker within striking distance of an upset against front-runner Mitt Romney in today's primary. It's a mirror image of what happened in Iowa, where a Romney super PAC hobbled Mr. Gingrich's chances, and it's likely a mere prelude to what will happen as the race moves next to Florida.

As for his experience, Mr. Dance has gotten stellar reviews from those he has supervised, even those who are much older than he. And in his administrative positions in Virginia and Texas, he has been involved in the budgeting process, facilities operation and maintenance, curriculum development, teacher training and other major challenges he will face. Whether he is ready to be solely responsible for them remains to be seen. But the one deficiency in his resume that some parents have latched onto — his two years of teaching experience — is a red herring. One year more or less in the classroom isn't what is going to make the difference in his success or failure.
Monday night they didn't score until Shin-Soo Choo narrowly escaped refracturing his left thumb in the sixth inning when he was hit by a pitch from left-hander Chris Sale.

This has provided not only a link between the warring sides but also plenty of opportunity for pot-stirring. Which Granatell does vigorously, if not always deftly. In one episode, she encourages Staub to call the police when she gets purportedly threatening text messages from Laurita’s daughter, and then we see her tell Laurita that she advised Staub to “let it go.” In another, she warns Caroline Manzo that Laurita is obsessed with Staub; when confronted by Laurita, she backpedals furiously.
For much of the world, the wedding was a dramatic reaffirmation of 29-year-old Kate's beguiling star power. Despite the pressure, she carried the day with an easy smile, youthful exuberance and a sense of decorum that matched the event.

Young Americans received unwelcome news this week when an April 23 AP report found 53.6 percent of college graduates under the age of 25 are jobless or underemployed, and there is little hope for improvement in the near future.

I see these tips before every major travel holiday. I'm actually grateful to ExxonMobil for one thing: It understands what so many others -- and I include travel writers like me -- don't. A vast majority of summer vacations will be domestic road trips. Only a fraction of us will fly. So the talk about fees and high fares doesn't really apply to most travelers. We're grounded.

Craig had two hits, both singles, in five at-bats for Memphis.
Mahdy looked left, then right. He had no particular place to go. The sugar cane harvest rolled past and the wheat rippled like a green sea in the wind. The fields were bigger when he was a boy. Families grew over the years and acres were divided and divided again, and now many farm only a scratch of earth in a strange mosaic that stretches past mud-brick homes.
The question Marylanders face is whether public affirmation of homosexual unions as a "marriage" is sound public policy. Traditional Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious teaching says that it is most certainly not. Many other religious and non-religious people, simply reflecting on the substance of the matter, agree. For the common good of the citizens of the Maryland, I hope most voters will agree that homosexual unions should not be recognized and sanctioned by the state as "marriages" and that they will vote against the law in November.

Students and teachers are chalking it up to "Be the Dream," an after-school student-teacher group that tackles head-on issues of race and the achievement gap that have left minority students lagging white students in test scores for years. In Minnesota, the gap is one of the widest in the nation.

Scotch: Famous Grouse ($19, 750ml), with a wee wisp of smoke and a body that works out three times a week, has to be where it's at for versatility. There's a reason that it's the best-selling blend in Scotland - thrifty Scots demand as much quality as they can get for their hard-earned poonds. And if you're on a budget but simply must have a single malt on hand, the Glenlivet 12-year-old ($25, 750ml) is the way to go. It has a little sweetness going for it that isn't to every malt-drinker's taste, but few people have anything bad to say. It makes for a great Rob Roy, too.

Courtney, however, wasn't entirely sold on the Los Angeles filmmakers who showed up asking to film the Tigers' season, one that could very well give the team its first playoff game victory. "Three 30-something guys show up in a borrowed car with two things about the size of a camcorder, whose total production experience is a very thought-provoking, important documentary about the World Series of Beer Pong," he joked. "We were thinking the movie would be something you'd see at 3 in the morning on cable."

With the earthquake and the damage to AMI Stadium it does add to the motivation for the Crusaders to win. It's been a huge challenge for us this year not being able to play home games. But we've come to realize that we are doing it for the people back home. It's very challenging hardly ever being home. We had 12 nights in Cape Town and that's the most nights we've spent in a row anywhere this year.

When I started my blog in 1999, I saw it as an extension of print travel writing, a form of journalism whose greatest works take risks. I understood that print travel writers had produced profound works, entertaining us with engaging adventures, opening our eyes to far-flung injustices, using the medium to delve into art, history or ecology.
Shahmia Boston looked at Temple University, the University of Delaware and Howard University in Washington, D.C. She picked Temple because it seemed more diverse, she said, “and I wanted to go to a school kind of like here.”

I've got more ripe Brandywines, Pink Cherokees and Black Krims than I can count. And every day seems a challenge to find yet one more way to use them up. Because this summer heat spell can't last.

Well-tended gardens surrounded a sparkling, oval-shaped pool ringed by individually owned units. Ours came with a king bed, pullout sofa, TV, dining room, full kitchen and balcony overlooking the pool. It was just my husband, Tom, and me, but the room could easily have slept four, given a handy room divider that made the unit feel more like a one-bedroom than a studio.
Boag also provided the voice of the Audio-Animatronics parrot Jose in Disneyland's Enchanted Tiki Room and wrote much of the script for the attraction. When Walt Disney World opened in Florida in 1971, Boag performed in its Diamond Horseshoe Revue for three years before returning to Disneyland.

The Saints (10-3) converted two third downs on their next drive before Brees connected again with Colston on a scoring pass, this time for 28 yards.
The question is doubly vexing in a country where every livable space is exploited. From the once-empty shores of the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, Egypt is awash in development and urbanization. Sharm El-Sheikh, the "Red Sea Riviera," sprawls for miles. Other resorts have popped up from the Suez Canal down the coast toward Sudan.
There are also dozens of PCC trams, an American model designed by the Presidents' Conference Committee in 1934 to try to lure passengers back to streetcars. They are a standard shape but painted in the colors of the cities that once operated them: Baltimore; Birmingham, Ala.; Boston; Brooklyn, N.Y.; Cincinnati; Dallas; Detroit; Kansas City, Mo.; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; New Orleans; San Diego; and Washington, D.C. I imagine brightly painted streetcars jiggling past the landmarks of America and wonder how different the U.S. would be if these cities still had this type of functioning public rail system.

Clyde Allen Jr., one of the university's 12 regents, said he did not think it would be hypocritical for the school to ban the sale of alcohol at college games but allow it -- often just a day later -- for the Vikings. "I do think there's a difference between the college games and the pro games," Allen said. "I think we have different facts ... and different situations to deal with."

Will Keyser added 11, none bigger than a turnaround jumper from the left baseline that sent it into overtime, as it came off a pass from Adams that was almost too difficult to handle. But Keysey grabbed it, then canned it.
Miley's ability to throw strikes has been perhaps the biggest reason he has thrown so well through 21 innings, posting a 1.29 ERA and turning in a pair of strong starts since moving into the rotation. He has cut his walk rate by one batter per nine innings and overall has thrown a higher percentage of strikes.
"We will figure something out, because he was a great champion," said Marculescu, adding that he had not yet spoken with FINA's medical commission. "We have to find out more details about what happened first."
West County (25-4) tied it at 40-40 with 2:30 left on a pair of Paige Forshee baskets, but Crystal City shut out the Bulldogs from there. Cooper and Riney each hit a pair of free throws down the stretch to give the Hornets the lead for good.

During a November hearing, another Mizioch attorney, Mark Lassiter, compared the intrigue to an Agatha Christie novel while arguing for a speedy judgment in favor of his client.

"To come out and play a game with that intensity and knowing how much it means to the Yankees, and for our guys to play on the same level of intensity, I'm pretty proud of them," Showalter said. "A lot of guys, at 4-1, 3-0, might have had thoughts of getting through customs in Toronto. But our guys have a lot of pride, and I'm proud of them."

Cowan, health, safety and environmental director for the Carson-based aerospace company, Ducommun, told me he often trains with Duke, sometimes even runs marathons.
The mispronunciation of Bimbo is leading the company to try to convince consumers that its name does not glorify dull-witted, readily bedded, sort-of celebrities. Bimbo has placed billboards along I-95 that instruct, "Say 'Beembo!'," and taken a trademark on that phrase.
The Italian carmaker aims to more than double its dealers in the country to as many as 200 by the end of 2013, Jack Cheng, general manager of GAC Fiat Automobile, said in an interview last week. GAC Fiat targets 100,000 vehicle sales next year, Cheng said.

Breaded shrimp, batter-fried “gold finger” chicken strips, shrimp toast, crab rangoons, barbecued spare rib, and two beef teriyaki skewers are served up on pretty, carved wooden Lazy Susan platters. The bite-sized finger foods surround a small can of Sterno fuel, which, when set aflame, takes on an aspect of glowing lava. The effect is quite fetching.

"We had to go through a lot of adversity," coach Erik Spoelstra said. "That struggle that we went through in March, where we lost five straight — all of them close games, where we didn't execute down the stretch and weren't able to close games out — that helped us. As painful as that was, we had to go through that fire together to be able to gain the confidence where we could be successful now in the postseason."

Rutgers coach Kyle Flood claims "there's always positives" to draw from scrimmages like the one his team held today at High Point Solutions Stadium, but it took some serious digging to find any on the offensive side of things.
But first there was the testing. Doctors had to determine if Arrigo was fit, both mentally and physically, for the operation.

Her conclusion is that shooting arrows just looks cool. "It's a powerful image to see someone full of vengeance hold up that bow and find that still place in order to use the weapon," she says.
An influx of crowds in the water usually spawns "localism," where native surfers get irked with travelers clogging the lineup. And while I'm sure El Salvador has its share, especially at the more hard-core breaks, I found no evidence of it in Playa El Tunco, except a wall with a big spray-painted message: Only Locals.

Diebold retains certain existing liabilities, including the ongoing lawsuit with the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, and shares with ES&S other liabilities of the elections systems business.
While small tech companies are learning to play the patent game, at least one larger one is trying to change the rules altogether.

Meredith, a critic of many of Indiana's recent education reforms, thinks she knows why. It was the state board that initiated takeover of the schools and chose the operators, Florida-based Charter Schools USA and Indianapolis' EdPower, to manage them. The board's reputation is on the line with the takeovers, she said.

Most passed gas is nitrogen. Carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen also are common and inoffensive byproducts of digestion. Embarrassing noises announce the passage of gas when your tense sphincter acts as a wind instrument. And the smell -- that's from hydrogen sulfide, which is produced when sulfur-rich food is digested by bacteria in your colon.
Though Considine ultimately would like to transition from acting altogether to focus solely on writing and directing, for now he is hoping to find a way to balance them.
In fact, in the summer of 1940, the head of publicity at the studio sent out a letter to his underlings to push Bogart as a romantic lead.

At Delmar Boulevard and Kingshighway, police nabbed four gangsters for trying to hijack a beer truck.
He would soon become a believer. The storm that slammed into the coast a year ago today ultimately caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage to Oregon and Washington, killed 18 people, led nine counties in Oregon and 10 in Washington to be declared federal disaster areas -- and created a new yardstick for the potential ferocity of Pacific Northwest storms.

“It’s always good to see a guy like that around here.”
Salle said police was relieved to end the investigation before Monday.
"These aren't hot, personal things," said Christopher Sagers, a law professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. "It's really about dollars and cents."
Make no mistake. Even during his Rookie of the Year run and subsequent All-Star seasons, it wasn't always a smooth ride. When the Suns needed leadership, he didn't know about to summon it. He had seen few successful examples of that in his life. He could be both moody and utterly impossible to read, the product of a complicated youth. It can be tough to manage your emotions when you have a front-row seat of others' inability to do so.
"It just kind of took on a life of its own after that."
The embarrassing fiasco has all but put the Magic back to square one in their relationship with him. It might be easier to rebuild the old imploded arena.

Life at Kabab Grill revolves not, as its name suggests, around a grill for its kebabs but around an imposing stone oven. The 4-by-6-foot custom-made behemoth dominates the open kitchen at this otherwise modest 2-month-old cafe in Palms. "Last week we roasted a whole stuffed lamb in it for someone's party," owner Firas Tar, who comes from Syria, tells a customer, clearly proud of his oven's prowess.
Jobs started looking for his biological family in his teens, according to an interview he gave to The New York Times in 1997. He found his biological sister when he was 27.

A five-year extension for Niese could be announced by Opening Day, the idea being they would buy out the lefty’s arbitration years and also lock him up for his first free agency year of 2016. Undoubtedly, it’s a risk. Yet this sort of risk makes more sense than would have even approaching the Marlins’ six-year, $106-million deal for Reyes. Or re-upping with Wright now.
"Our collecting strategy wasn't name-driven," curator Rosen says.
Reed said at the time that Slay's office had given him just two days to review the measures. He wanted to understand the complicated bills before assigning them to committee.
"(Captain America) doesn't really have any training in any one particular style of fighting, so it wasn't like I had to learn some certain type of martial arts," he said. "You just have to learn the choreography like you would a dance, you know, punch here, step here. It's just a lot of stunt training. It's kind of fun. It's kind of like summer camp."

Hermit Gulch is about a mile and a half from downtown, a slight uphill hike all the way. A taxi ferried our stuff, and us, to the campground (less expensive than having our things transported and walking there and less heinous than the idea of carrying it all up ourselves). After setting up a trio of tents and discovering, to my extreme dismay, that the battery-powered pump I'd brought for my air mattress had had a meltdown on the trip over, we took off for town on foot along Avalon Canyon Road.

So lawmakers will waste time debating and passing resolutions criticizing the federal government. When much of the nation's growth depends on immigrants, they'll debate making English the state's official language.

So where do the witches come in? In today's Scandinavia, the tradition is now considered quite sweet, but it has a dark background.

What gives the Xolos a sliver of hope is their defense, which has been the Primera's best during the Clausura season. The Xolos allowed just 11 goals, two fewer than anyone else.

Highsmith's happiest book, her only happy book — and it's nonetheless filled with spiky shards — is "The Price of Salt," a lesbian love story she published under the pseudonym Claire Morgan in 1952. When I mentioned it to her in a hotel in London in the 1990s, she said, "Please don't say I wrote that." The request couldn't have been more polite, but Highsmith's chilling tone, allied to an almost indiscernible movement of her big and rather mannish hands, suggested that if I disobeyed, Ripley himself would arrange for me to be found floating dead in some stinking canal. She had that kind of aura, as if her fictional world might spring to life and start a nasty plot just for you.
Four albums later, Gauthier, now 44, has become revered by critics and fans for the balance of down-home grit and elegant poetry in her songs, which she sings with a voice that is warm, dry and comfortably weathered.

And more often than not, that meaning arises from her personal struggles with life's deepest issues.

The Brazen Head, Ireland's oldest pub (est. 1198), offers a traditional Irish stew and a beef and Guinness stew. Both are, well, Irish and popular, says manager Podge Byrnes, but the creamy character of the beef's gravy beats the clear broth of the traditional "by a nose."

Of course, that's only an indicator of sentiment – not how people will actually vote. Recent polling on actual candidate preference shows Romney closing the gap with Obama – and in some case pulling slightly ahead. (RealClearPolitics' averaging of major polls has the two in a statistical dead heat.) Romney's challenge now is to build on the momentum boost he got from Rick Santorum dropping out – and to turn around some of his negative impressions.
If two highly qualified professional economists cannot agree where California's economy is headed, how can the rest of us  not to mention those we elect to political office  view the future with any degree of certainty?

Ryan learned the hard way that even he, Son of Buddy, could not X and O his way to the quarterback. Mike DeVito is a workmanlike defensive end, but hardly reminds anyone of Joe Klecko or Mark Gastineau. If Ryan can get Coples to Play Like A Jet — not like any of the 2011 Jets — he’ll have a pair of imposing bookends in Coples and Mo Wilkerson, last year’s No. 1 pick.

The debates push us in different ways. We've heard candidates charge that all Muslims are extremists, and pundits discuss whether Mormons are Christians.

First base coach Wayne Kirby's brother, Terry, a former NFL running back, was in the Orioles' clubhouse before the game. … Gonzalez (bruised left wrist) and Mark Hendrickson (bruised left shoulder) were unavailable for Sunday's game after getting hit by line drives Saturday night. Both said they were a little sore but expected to be ready by Tuesday in Kansas City. … Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter left the game in the fifth after being struck on the hand by a pitch from Jake Arrieta in the third. He was diagnosed with a bruised right middle finger. X-rays were negative. Eduardo Nunez moved from second to short, and catcher Francisco Cervelli came in to play second for the first time in his career. … Later in the game, Robinson Cano moved from designated hitter to second and the Yankees lost their DH spot.

So thanks to the new health-care law and the Obama administration's mandate, a 60-year-old such as me has to pay for 14, 15 and 16-year-old girls' birth-control pills. I'm against abortion, but I have to pay for morning-after abortion pills. I also have to pay for women to get sterilized, a very expensive procedure. Making me pay for things my insurance company has to cover, things against my beliefs, is taking away my freedom. I should decide how to spend my money. The government shouldn't force me to pay for things. Pregnancy isn't a disease. In my opinion women should pay for their own birth-control pills or IUDs or condoms. I shouldn't have to pay for those things. Will I be forced someday to pay for men's condoms and Viagra pills? The government doesn't pay for anything. Taxpayers pay.

So, in 2008, our term-limited Statehouse patriots, short of state budget money because of wrong-headed tax "reform" and tax cuts, yanked back the anti-smoking money to help finance a state jobs program.

Kobach calls himself an "adviser" to the Romney campaign. But recently, the campaign told Politico that the anti-illegal-immigration crusader is merely a "supporter."

"What the proponents of this would say is that every child has the right to a world-class education and if they can't get it in their own school, they ought to be able to go somewhere else and get it," DuBray said.

In an interview this month, Beckman explained that his firm had compared its own performance against mutual funds in Morningstar's database.

Until then, if the coach steps out of the huddle and starts writing, he’s probably not diagramming a play. He’s managing his anger in a season that’s caused plenty of it, and in the process, trying to find a way to make sure those eyes on the bench are staring back at him.

Policymakers see rising health care costs as the central threat to household budgets and the country's fiscal health.
But here's what's scary about Kasich: With his Red Bull style, it is sometimes hard to tell what's core belief, what's hot air and whether even he knows the difference. When Kasich praises Ohio's innovative Third Frontier effort, he still says things that suggest he doesn't understand or care how it works. Or listen to him talk about phasing out Ohio's income tax, reducing the state's commitment to public schools or even making university professors work harder. Does he understand that being a Fox News provocateur is not the same as being the leader of a diverse, complex state?

"It's a great team," James said of Boston in the on-court celebration. "Like I said, I got the utmost respect for that team.

Too well, in fact. At times, his film, based on Jonathan Safran Foer's novel about a family shattered by the 9/11 terrorist attacks, seems to exist only to tug at the audience's heartstrings. It's manipulative as all get-out, playing up the outstanding performance by newcomer Thomas Horn for maximum emotional payoff. Luckily, Horn is so good -- as is Max von Sydow, in a wordless role -- that the film resonates in spite of the tear-jerking strings Daldry pulls.
