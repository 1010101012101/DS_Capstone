In addition to 1992, let's remember 1985, when Los Angeles was cocky. Twenty years had passed since the notorious Watts riots, and civic leaders congratulated themselves on what their city had become since then. They had just wrapped up the wildly successful Olympics. L.A. was the capital of the emerging Pacific Rim and held a key position on the international stage. An African American mayor presided over a multiethnic city of the future. South Los Angeles residents had access to a full-service medical center, and there were promises of new grocery stores and retail centers in the very near future. Racial tension had been conquered. Two decades after the violence, it was easy for the comfortable to scoff at the notion that anything was amiss here.

5. Practical. My idea of a great stocking stuffer is a cordless screwdriver.

The 1992 Los Angeles riots led to McCarthy's unexpected involvement in what became the UFC. McCarthy was a Los Angeles police officer and the LAPD convened a Civilian Martial Arts Advisory Panel to discover new tactics to use in subduing suspects. It was here McCarthy met Rorion Gracie, who invited him to try Gracie Jiu-Jitsu at his Torrence, Calif. academy. Soon, McCarthy was hooked. When Gracie and advertising executive Art Davie came up with a concept of a tournament to discover which type of martial art was superior, McCarthy was there to assist the launch.
Nicholas David Coleman was a political original -- an Irish Catholic St. Paulite who found a home in legislative politics. By all accounts, he had the gift -- smart, eloquent, funny, emotional and wise in the maddeningly obscure ways of the State Capitol. He was a liberal JFK man who was elected to the state Senate in 1962, fell just short in a run for his party's nod for governor in 1970, became majority leader in 1973 and served with style, wit and considerable success until he decided against running for re-election in 1980.

In more comical romances like "The Breakup" or "Annie Hall," the lovers merely seem — frustratingly — out of sync. One-sided arguments erupt from nowhere; ancient neuroses tumble out like clothes from a crammed closet. Yet once the lovers split, they rush to re-create the failed romance with similar partners. These comedies are, ironically, the saddest romances; no one ever changes, no one ever learns.

Fascinating matchup here, pitting the underrated Mize (his glory didn't come until joining the New York Giants) against the current curveball king, Wainwright. Considering the righty missed the entire 2011 season, it's noteworthy that he made the field as a 14 seed, a shoo-in as opposed to teammates Yadier Molina and Holliday who needed play-ins to qualify. Mize is a Hall of Famer who twice led the league in homers as a Cardinal. From 1938 to '40, Mize had a league-high OPS that topped 1.000 in each season. We'd all agree that Wainwright's future is bright, and that in forthcoming tournaments he's likely to be the No. 3 seed.

That bubble lasted only so long. When the minimalism movement of Jil Sander, Helmut Lang and Miuccia Prada seized fashion in the late 1990s, Van Noten found himself struggling again. "We were doing a lot of rich prints, fancy things, as everything became more minimal and conceptual," he says. At the same time, corporate groups such as LVMH, Prada and the newly formed Gucci Group began buying up small, independent fashion companies like Van Noten's as well as major fashion suppliers. "Our shoe manufacturer group was bought by Armani, our heel manufacturer group was taken over by the Gucci Group and our last manufacturer was taken over by the Prada group," he explains. "Of course, when those people buy those companies, you are not the first served. We thought: Do we still have a future if we don't join a group?"
Especially since the history involves local history and one of Kissimmee's most colorful characters.
"Obviously, there's a lot of question marks there," he said. "It comes automatically, the feeling, 'Is this over right now?' Mixed feelings. You still want to be in the playoffs and not finish the season there. The last home game I felt there was still a lot of desire to play."
"It's actually a joke; it feels ridiculous," said Jim Riches, a retired New York firefighter whose firefighter son, Jimmy, died at the World Trade Center.

If these transitional issues are managed properly, the shift could yield a healthcare system that's more sensitive to market forces and more affordable in the long run. That's a big "if," however. The potential downside is a system with more uninsured Americans. It's also worth noting that such a shift wouldn't do much for those who can't afford insurance today, such as the working poor, unless the change is accompanied by new subsidies for individual purchasers -- perhaps in the form of refundable tax credits.

"The Raven" is a talky film filled with lots of rambling discourses for Cusack, which the actor handles well enough. It's the mishmash of competing issues and emotions that the character is weighed down with that trips things up. Sometimes Poe is raving mad, as the poet was said to be near the end of his short life, and sometimes he's stone-cold sober, putting his intellect to the task. But it all feels rather random. As for the romance, Poe's and the fiancée's flirtations are as deadly as anything the killer serves up.

Such a ruling would let police question people about their immigration status if they have good reason to do so, but police would have to call federal authorities to see if they would want to pick up anyone found to be in the country illegally.

The Prime Rib has been around long enough to see its style fall in and out of fashion. Lately, the TV series "Mad Men" has helped spark a renewed interest in the food and fashion of the time.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. - The self-proclaimed "Ice Cream of the Future" apparently will have a future after all.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the village of Roxana and the school districts in Roxana, Wood River and East Alton.

They say the agencies have violated the state's Open Meetings Act and Freedom of Information Act, essentially shutting the local taxing bodies out of the process.

"It's the skinnying down of America and the whole world," says Steve Swasey, a spokesman for Netflix. "It's great to buy a book or DVD, but in truth, how many times will you read or watch it?

And, wait, didn't I just see that French globe in the store? "The original globe was broken during the reproduction process," Friedman explains. "I'm the only one who knows my globe's not the original." That fuzzy line between authenticity and the reproduction can rankle purists, who see in the democratization of taste a profusion of tasteful items "devalued," as Paul Goldberger once wrote, in a piece about Friedman when he was at Pottery Barn, "by their very accessibility." But Friedman says he's just trying to bring the things he enjoys to more people. "My house is filled with Libeco-Lagae linens," he says. "They cost $85 a yard." With Restoration, however, he flew to Belgium to meet with Libeco CEO Raymond Libeert. "We were able to buy linen for $14 a yard, bring a value to an American customer they hadn't seen," he says. "We're now their biggest customer in the world." As Cole describes it, "He's breaking open the mysteries of the business." Who could object to that—save the person who paid $85 a yard?

Dirks is hitting .423 and began the day leading the Grapefruit League in hitting. It is hard to believe he won't make the team.

Q: Hey, Brian: How sheltered is LeBron James to the massive multi-city fall out? While Dan Gilbert's comments could not be hidden, how ignorant is LeBron to the rest of the world?

Many important legal questions have been raised about drone strikes. The U.S. government arguably has legal authority to conduct military operations in Afghanistan, based on the original congressional authorization adopted after 9/11. It is questionable, however, whether this authority extends to Pakistan, a country that is supposedly an ally of the United States. Nor do we have legal authority to launch military strikes in Yemen, Somalia and other countries where the United States is not officially engaged in armed hostilities.

Therefore, exercise therapy may be essential for quality of life. Most people with cancer experience a decline in health due to inactivity, leading to weakened muscles, bones and a mind susceptible to depression and anxiety. Health care providers must motivate, educate and guide patients with cancer to exercise safely not just to enhance treatment effects, but also help prevent costly disease (such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, depression) that can contribute to poor life quality and early death (Journal of Oncology Practice 2011).

Kovash, writing on behalf of the West Linn City Council writes: "We are concerned that the evaluation of potential project impacts does not fully anticipate the added inconvenience for public transit users south of Lake Oswego; the added vehicular congestion on Highway 43 resulting from higher density mixed-use development in the Foothills District of Lake Oswego and in Portland's John's Landing Neighborhood; and the desire of West Linn's residents to participate in this process."
For they know that mortal danger didn't pass with Japan's surrender in 1945. Three American warships have sunk with loss of life since then, all submarines: USS Cochino in August 1949; USS Thresher in April 1963, and USS Scorpion in May 1968.
On Friday, Edwards' defense team will have its turn and plans to ask U.S. District Court Judge Catherine C. Eagles to dismiss the case for lack of evidence.

Last season: There weren't many positives following coach Pat Shurmur's first season, as tumultuous as any since Browns' expansion return. Lockout, costly injuries, dropped passes, endless drama surrounding running back Peyton Hillis and tough division combined to keep Browns among NFL's worst teams. QB Colt McCoy didn't develop as hoped in first full season, which ended with a concussion. Browns scored 218 points as lack of playmakers inhibited McCoy's progress and sent team on failed offseason pursuit of Robert Griffin III.

The whole thing made Pickett a little uncomfortable, because he wants to be a straight-arrow, rules-following kind of Wyoming game warden.

Lehman, sixth on the Champions Tour in driving distance, then hit his approach to the 521-yard 15th over the green and missed a 7-footer for birdie. Funk knocked his approach into the greenside bunker, but blasted out to four 4 for a birdie to cut Lehman's lead to one.
To me, the shelves of artisanal crafts on sale at A Vida Portuguesa, back downtown, looked more artful and exuded an actual sense of place. As much curated gallery as boutique, A Vida showcases majolica ceramics, straw baskets, Portuguese soaps and candles. I was torn between a wool horse blanket, woven in the mountains, that came banded with vivid stripes of blue, yellow, green and orange, and a handkerchief embroidered with candy-colored hearts, floral garlands and love poems. "Country girls in northern Portugal would make these and give them to the boys they loved," the sales clerk told me. "If the boy wore it around his neck it was like an engagement ring; if he handed it back to the girl, it meant there was no hope."

Waimea: It’s impossible to find a town in Hawaii untouched by tourism but still enjoyable for the visitor. Waimea comes as close as any. On the far southwestern shore of Kauai, it’s visited only by tourists on the way to nearby Waimea Canyon. This is still a place that mainly caters to locals, who often gather in the shade of the statue of Captain Cook in the center of the park. Make sure to visit even sleepier Hanapepe, the inspiration for Disney’s “Lilo and Stitch,” on the way back to the busy eastern or southern sides of Kauai.

Yes, Santorum and Robertson both equate the political struggle with a spiritual war, although Santorum always stops just a word or two short of stating outright that the president is on the side of Satan, Hitler and Robespierre. His implication is clear, however. In this spiritual war, the president is on the wrong side and a vote for him is a vote for a godless, secular America.
"Dick Clark was a primary force in legitimizing rock 'n' roll," Uslan said. "He was able to use his unparalleled communication skills to present it in a way that it was palatable to parents and the establishment.

He would say, 'Start them out with the mild stuff first, and once they get a taste for it they'll jump in for the really hot stuff, the authentic stuff.' "

Allergies: Scandinavian, Dutch and Japanese studies show a higher prevalence of food allergies in children born in fall or winter than in those born in summer. Allergy expert Dr. Milo Vassallo of Brooklyn, N.Y., reviewed cases of more than 1,000 patients at three Boston emergency rooms who had food-related acute allergic reactions. He found that fall and winter birth was associated with 53% higher odds of having a food allergy. He thinks it could be due to seasonal fluctuations in vitamin D, since deficiencies can weaken the immune system. The only two reliable sources of this vitamin are sunlight and supplements, so the risk will depend on where you live, he says: "Because of the higher latitude and more exaggerated fluctuations in sun exposure, children born in the fall and winter in Boston may be at increased risk than those in Los Angeles."
What's more, Monkey Cat considers itself exceptionally dog-friendly. Once we noticed that claim on the restaurant's website, we returned with one of our three dogs and dined on the side patio with Abbey, who slept through most of the experience.

A fish ladder deep within the concrete buildings of the Bonneville Dam complex isn't designed for salmon. It's a mockup of a fish ladder entrance, part of a little-known but urgent drive by federal and tribal agencies to make Northwest dams friendlier to an odd and ancient fish that draws scarce attention and less love.
Smaardyk said Gardner is an extreme case, but it isn't the only district having difficulties with finances. “I would not say that it's limited to them entirely,” she said. “I would say they're one of the first we've downgraded.

And City Commissioner Tomas Regalado of Miami easily won the race to become the city's mayor, after promising voters a "back to basics" approach focused on improving city services.
Life expectancy does not suffer from the same measurement problems that distort infant mortality comparisons. Even so, the U.S. ranking of 39th in life expectancy (according to U.N. figures) also is thoroughly misleading. When life expectancy figures are adjusted to account for deaths due to violence, the United States ranks No. 1 among nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. U.S. deaths due to violence include all gunshot-related deaths as well as deaths due to automobile accidents or other injuries. Such deaths, obviously, say nothing about the quality of U.S. medical care.

In court pleadings, Wasemiller acknowledged that Little developed a "severe medical complication" after he operated on her, but he defended his work and denied responsibility for any subsequent injuries.

Still, I did badger out of him the following: Haidl not only brought his civil lawyer to the table, but he brought in an L.A.-based criminal specialist, a former assistant U.S. attorney, in fact, by the name of Mark Byrne.

Publisher: . . . but the modern-day Romeo and Juliet? I never cared what happened to either of them -- there wasn't a romance novel cliche left unturned in their story. They hate each other, they argue constantly, but only because they are so attracted to each other. They hide secrets, he could be a bad guy or a good guy, which is it? He could be trying to kill her, but he's so dreamy, she'll still "reluctantly" succumb to his kisses. And all those action scenes? Why didn't you tell her they were a bit over the top?

But the film's U.S. distributor decided that Americans would be put off by the original title. It was released in the United Kingdom as "The Pirates!

On Saturday, Executive Food and Wine Editor Michael Bauer made a special trip to the office to brine the navy team's bird and rub the white team's turkey with a special Cajun herb concoction, a recipe that Lovell provided. The Berkeley attorney said he was inspired by a shaker of Pappy's, a blend of spices that is to California's Central Coast what Tabasco is to Louisiana. By the time the teams met to strategize, the birds were good and marinated.

"The Dark Knight" (2008): Pretty much all big summer movies get hyped, and Christopher Nolan's second crack at Batman was no exception. But this one lived up to it, buoyed by Heath Ledger's fantastic, Oscar-winning performance as the Joker. Dark, and darkly humorous, as well as a massive (and well-deserved) success.

Las Vegas has long been enamored with its gangster roots. Its longtime former mayor played himself in the mob flick "Casino," and hotels here often promote their nefarious origins.

Is this chamber-sized musical the right vehicle for tragedy of these proportions? I suspect that question will be a source of disagreement among viewers. Normally, this kind of story gets big-venue, operatic treatment. To me, a small theater such as SCR's Julianne Argyros Stage is almost too intimate to contain the huge, raw emotions of "Cloudlands'" final moments. At times you'll feel like averting your eyes.
A spokeswoman for Toll Brothers, the Horsham, Pa.-based real estate company he co-founded, said he was not immediately available for comment. She also was unable to immediately say whether Toll might try building a casino there or instead try to sell the property to others now that its value has increased.

Workers are sometimes killed where they stand. Others have lost arms and legs. Their spines may be damaged from years of heavy lifting and constant vibration, and their hearing is sometimes lost from years of noise. Safety is preached routinely, but thousands of accidents still take place each year throughout the industry.
He said educators enrolled in the TRS pay 9.4 percent of their earnings toward retirement, and school districts put in 0.58 percent. (Except for a 2-percentage-point reduction this calendar year, workers in Social Security and their employers each pay 6.2 percent.) Tobin said that current state pension benefits are protected by the Illinois Constitution but that legislators should increase employee pension contributions, put new employees into Social Security and require public employees to pay half their health insurance.

It's unclear if a higher level of Afghan authority will actually mean that the targets of raids will be treated more humanely. Villagers have complained at times that Afghan forces loot houses when they conduct raids. Also, the U.S. military stopped transferring detainees to some Afghan prisons last year after the U.N. discovered evidence of torture.

So since when has George cared so much about Sacramento? Last year, when he tried to relocate the Kings to Anaheim, then had to hastily unpack his bags? The last few weeks, when he slipped his fingers out of the handshake agreement? The last few days, when the team secured another appearance at the NBA draft lottery?

Wilson's shout came during Obama's speech after the president commented that illegal immigrants would be ineligible for federal subsidies to buy health insurance.

Family affair: San Diego's Medical Director Jim Dunford, who's been advocating for the city's chronic homeless for more than a decade, will talk about it April 28 at the Lawrence Family's Bankers Hill manse. It's the third annual Girls Think Tank Gala to raise funds for a legal clinic serving the city's homeless.

Until this month, Apple and its stock were thought to be immune to market forces. Instead, they were the market forces. Where other giants failed to marry technology and simplicity, Apple created the iPad. When digital media freely galloped across the Internet, Apple corralled it in iTunes for a price. The company once best known for selling computers to schools now has its products in half of American households.
"That would probably be the largest support order in the history of the Family Court," said Support Magistrate Matthew Troy at the hearing in Manhattan Monday.

3. Make sure the stump is dry. I placed ours in our garage for about a year (custom furniture maker Charles Freeborn says six months to a year is adequate for the outer faces to dry enough to sand and finish.) Elevate it off the ground with small pieces of wood for good circulation, or it could rot from the inside. If the stump dries too fast (Dennis' note: Not much chance of that in rainy Oregon, is there?), it can crack.

Early last year, Illinois lawmakers boosted personal income taxes there by two-thirds, and the corporate tax rate from 7.3 percent to 9.5 percent. That prompted other states to start trying to lure companies out of Illinois, and big-name firms ranging from Sears to Jimmy John's have publicly mulled moving headquarters operations elsewhere - though none have as yet. Late last year, lawmakers passed a package of tax breaks to help keep some of those companies in the state.
District officials will likely ask the school board June 5 to put the reauthorization of the seven-year maintenance and operations override on the November ballot.

The San Jose Mercury News reported that coach Don Nelson has started a not-so-covert campaign for Jamal Crawford to use his option to get out of his contract at season's end, leaving $20 million on the table.

At that point, the Ravens hadn’t addressed the receiver position, but Cameron said that if they were to draft one, size wouldn’t be as big of a deal to him as was catching radius and play-making ability, but he noted that “big throwing to big is tough to stop.” Hours later, the Ravens drafted 6-foot-4 Miami speedster Tommy Streeter. He fits the description that Cameron had been talking about.
"Jill Green clearly has had an amazing record of building a renowned school, and this included raising funds far, far in excess of any small amounts that could be considered in dispute," parent Robert Kovelman wrote.

At 21 (Holiday) and 23 (Turner) both are still in their formidable years as far as the NBA goes. So when they combined to start the game by missing 19 of their first 22 shots, they had the type of reaction you wouldn’t expect from youngsters. Instead of feeling the lump grow larger in their throats during a critical Game 4 against the Chicago Bulls, they looked at each other and laughed.
The department plan to offer immune globulin or hepatitis A vaccines in the church auditorium this week.
