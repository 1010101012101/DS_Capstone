I looked everywhere. I couldn’t find her. I was determined to.
That's when things went lightening fast. He found a place for us to live and moved out. I started packing, bought a one-way ticket and put in my notice at work. I also filed for divorce. I'm sure most of you know how quickly you can get a divorce in Las Vegas. The morning of April 28th, 2000 I boarded a plane and was on my way to Calgary. I had never even been to Canada. To be honest, I had never even thought about visiting Canada. And now here I was, on my way to live with a guy I'd only known in person for 5 days! What was I thinking?? hahaha Well obviously this story has a happy ending. We've been together ever since and added a daughter to our little family. We finally made our love "legal" on August 8, 2009.
Tonight though, there is no limousines, chauffeurs, 4x4's or people carriers gracing its muddy car park. From a distance I can only make a ring of fog which surrounds the pub and juts out to sea like a large floating Frisbee.
Everyone was shocked that it had lasted this long; they didn’t see it. She didn’t look like his other girlfriends, but it wasn’t just that. She was muted, somehow. All of the other girls he brought home, loved and then proceeded to hurt because he wasn’t ready for the commitment, they were all strong. Loud. Challenging. Not her, things had always been easy with her. Like gentle waves, soft breezes, perfect summer days. No questions, no worries. Seducing him into a security he had never known. She was his for the taking.

I responded by making loud vomit noises. In front of two children, who had taken that moment to sneak up behind me as I was loading up my basket full of Cherry Coke and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They looked horrified.
Over the Easter holiday period we had a trip to Gower Peninsula. It is so close from Cirencester just across the Bristol Chanel. We stayed in Swansea city in the newly developed waterfront.
When JRD Skinner heard that an Anglerfish was terrorizing one of the norther colonies of Atlantis, he took his vorpal trident in hand (long time the manxome foe he sought) and finally, in the glow of bioluminescent rays, JRD Skinner sliced the beast’s spines and teeth off – thus making it as harmless as a goldfish.

Hello Friends...
on another subject the shooting in sanford is not a racial issue they made it one and most of the people complaining and causing problems dont even live here and as usual collage kids think they are right and everbody else is wrong. believe me if there was a case the man would be in jail for sure. and for the record any fight is for your life because anytime someone attacks another person there is a chance of a death. ie saw 2 12 year old kids fighting one fell to the ground and the other kick him in the head, the boy died next day in hospital. (was friends with my kid) the aggressure was charged with the crime, the 2 were best freinds and were arguing over who skated better. point being death is never an accident there is always cause and effect. the problem here is some one wants a racial issue and they are not getting their way. besides in orlando and surrounding areas we are averaging 3 to 4 shootings a day, 75 percent involve young black males. dont see the white cummunity out protesting for their rights and safety. by what has come out looks like the young man tried to attack the armed citizen and paid the price. i have to say i have been followed and threated by young black males more than once, if they ever decided to jump me so to speak i would defend my self by any means nessary. and believe it would be a life or death struggle this is life not UCF or WWE its real life. Race, color or creed meen nothing if you decide to take from me. There is no substute for total victory. regardless this sanford shooting is just a excuse for racial tensions and the usual suspects are checking in and collecting their share of fame. it desgracful how the public is treating this and the media has egged it on. this will turn it to some bill to limit gun ownership and make people scared to defend them self. they have a rule out as well called justifable use of deadly force, not saying go out and be the want to be policeman. i am saying stand up and be a man, if your wrong admit it and stop blaiming your problems on other people or the color of your skin. but remember if you like to fight or want to fight or attack someone it can and will cost you your life at some point. the hardest thing for any human to do is to take a life it lives with you for ever and is a heavy burden to carry for anyone. let the law work and then decide if your point of view is right or wrong, and ask youself is your opion is worth you life and physically fighting for. or maybe justice was served that night not our place to judge its the court and the law.

DANFORTH: If this trend succeeds, yeah. What they will be left with, if indeed they want to purge the party of all but people who have a particular ideological slant… it’s not a way to win elections, it’s not political sustainable. It might make them feel good for a time but doesn’t work, it hasn’t worked. It didn’t work in Nevada or in Delaware in last election. They won nominations but couldn’t win elections. I don’t know how you win elections without getting 51% of the vote. I don’t see how you’re gonna get 51% of the vote if you make it clear that people in your own party, who don’t absolutely agree with everything you want to do, aren’t wanted.

Now Orca also brought a gift the party as well. This being a Bassinet. Now at first we didn't even SEE the bassinet. It wasn't in the pile of gifts. It was in the grass by the garbage, by orders of Sita. That was pretty strange we didn't exactly know why for a while, she seemed quite about it. Even stranger was that this thing was already out of the box, fully put together. She had told them that she had put it together the night before to make it "easier for them". After she had left, the true story came out in Sitas rage. The thing was a piece of garbage and she was a dam liar. Getting a closer look, the thing was completely scratched up and looked like it had been used for years. The instructions she left in a Ziploc bag were under a 2003 Copyright. But it got it even worse when we finally brought it up to the deck for a closer look.
Now concerning the rest of this season four set, it's awesome. We see the arrival of Future Trunks, my favorite version of the character and the Androids, a fantastic bunch of not quite villains but not quite heroes either. Let's go back to Future Trunks. Goku still hasn't come back to Earth yet and a year and a half has passed since Freeza was killed. Or was he? Freeza somehow managed to survive an epic beat down by Goku and having a planet blow up in his face. The most powerful force in the universe is now a cyborg and as a result, he's much stronger than he was before. As payback for such a humiliating defeat, Freeza is headed to earth with daddy, King Cold, in tow and plans to make the Saiyan pay by wiping out all live on Earth. As the Z Fighters prepare to make a hopeless last stand, a mysterious youth appears of nowhere and says he's going to kill Freeza. Said mysterious youth is of course, Future Trunks. Freeza, unimpressed, blows him off but when he transforms into a Super Saiyan, he starts freaking out. Future Trunks effortlessly knocks back everything Freeza throws at him and finally finishes him off by slice him in half. King Cold doesn't fare any better and he's quickly disposed off. In a series where such spectacular displays of power happen so many times, Future Trunks killing Freeza and King Cold with ease is still a sight to behold. We don't get to see Future Trunks look this awesome in battle again until the last episode of season six.
The way Levine switches back and forth between past, present and future tense struck me as pleasant somehow. It felt so natural and conversational and not at all stuffy or formal. He also shifts between first, second and third person. Depending on whether he started a line or thought with “I” or “We” or “You” or an ambiguous he/she/it felt important. When he separated “—if you’re scared—” from everything else using dashes, it felt like he was talking to me specifically and I found myself paying closer attention, wanting to prove I wasn’t scared to tackle this.
I give you the latest Gallup employment survey – Flatlining. Note the lines from February of 2010 (larger graf) or January, 2010 (smaller one below it) to April, 2011, are running more or less flat, as is the line for underemployment (19.4 percent!!).

On this particular day, traffic was stopped as I was crossing the bridge. I’m walking, trying not to make eye contact, when a man leans out of the window of a truck and says to me, “Heyyy, baby, give me a smile!” I don’t look at him and keep walking. Then, in my peripheral vision, I see him lean back out the window and he screams at me, “You stuck-up BITCH!”
Mom: whats wrong?
All in all a good book, the characters were well developed and the plot was interesting. I had fun learning about each of the 3 characters, their personalities, their past, their thoughts and feelings....I think this is a book I'll read again, because I think that the second time will flow a little better for me, and it was really quite enjoyable despite the disrupted feeling.

I followed author R.L. Stine one day, a while back, for one reason and one reason only, I once knew a kid who was obsessed with the “Goosebumps” series. I had never read any of the books but I do remember when the television series started on Friday nights. So, I followed R.L. Stine.
As a former fat kid and still struggling weight conscious adult (notice I didn’t say fat), I’m amazed at how much value I put on my beauty. I’ve been made fun of, shunned by the boys, mocked openly in public for my appearance, and the greatest embarrassment of them all…asked when the baby was due. No matter how I excel at my job, marathon training, education, or other success factors, if I don’t look good, then I have little value. It’s a message that I have believed in for so many years. And it’s time to decode and reframe it.

The softness of the sand forces the banana trees to remain at human height where the richness of the salt content from the sea actually be part of the fruits development. The fruit will taste 15% sweeter than normal plantation bananas. The texture of the banana skin will be as those found in coconut, therefore preserving the life span of the bananas.
Tevye was the first one to get sick, and spent his days sleeping on the couch. I couldn’t figure out why he had gotten sick and the rest of us hadn’t. He, as far as I could figure out, was always with me. Then I remembered that he has now gone to preschool twice! Well if this sort of thing is going to be happening every second time he goes to school, then perhaps I’ll be homeschooling him instead. This just didn’t seem worth it.

Back in 2004 when I was what seems now like a tender age of 32 I created a list My Pre-40 Top 40 which was designed to outline the things I wished to achieve before 2011 when I hit the less than eagerly-anticipated age of 40. My reasons for making the list public were multiple, firstly I thought it would be of interest to people to see what it was that I wished to do, the things that made up my character, or that which I hoped would make up my character. Secondly I wanted to put it out there in order to give myself the impetus of doing these things, a kick up the arse in the wanting not to look stupid in front of my readership, like an internal competition as it were, something I need to spur me on a little. I think were I to have had a steady relationship during this time and had I shared my list with my partner there might have been an overlap in the things they wanted to do too, thus increasing the likelihood of some of these happening. This may of course be my slothfulness attempting to abdicate responsibility and trying to place the onus on someone else making sure I do what I should want to do enough myself. I am fairly sure though in my defence that I would be nurtuting enough of my partner to help them complete items on their list whether or not they were something of interest to me. There is a great pleasure seeing someone you love find or achieve something that makes them happy. If you have helped and participated in any way it heightens this joy because it makes you feel useful.

The writing style was mainly in first person POV, but some parts were his notes jotted down on pieces of bark, in first person POV.

If a woman in her sixties with osteoporosis in her back wants to spend the next twenty years bending over and scrubbing the carpet clean with her arthritic hands because she’s being too fucking stupid to listen to anyone telling her that that is what she is going to have to do, she can go right ahead. It’ll be entirely her own fault, I will have no sympathy, and if I spill a mug of coffee it’ll be a real shame that she didn’t get a carpet dark enough to hide the stain.

The characters were amazing as well. I really loved that they all cared for each other and looked out for one another. The romance was very sweet between Madison and Issac. I appreciated that the author made a point to have Madison question her love for Issac seeing as how they barely knew each other. That to me was a very mature thing to do and I am glad that it was in the story

Garden got watered for 1 hour this afternoon.
In any event the existence or non-existence of an emergency is a question of facts which may not always be determine without the evidence by mere reference to facts within the judicial notice. In the present cases, there has been no trial for the reception of proof, and I am not aware that enough facts have been shown to justify the conclusion that the emergency in question has already ceased. On the other hand, since the exercise of the emergency powers by the President presupposes a determination of the existence of the emergency, the President must be presumed to have satisfied himself in some appropriate manner that the emergency existed when he issued his executive orders. Under the theory of separation of powers and in accord with the latest ruling of the United States Supreme Court, it is not for the judiciary to review the finding of the Executive in this regard. Judicial review would in such case amount to control of executive discretion and place the judicial branch above a co-equal department of the Government. Only in case of a manifest abuse of the exercise of powers by a political branch of the Government is judicial interference allowable in order to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution. But with the cold war still going on though the shooting war has already ended; with the world still in turmoil so much so that the American Secretary of the State has declared that “the world has never before in peace time been as troubled or hazardous as it is right now;” with most of the industries of the country still unrihabilitated, so that a large proportion of our food and other necessaries have to be imported; with a great portion of the population still living in temporary quarters; with most of the war damage claims still unpaid; and with peace and other conditions in the country far from normal, it would be presumptuous for this Court, without proof of the actual condition obtaining in all parts of the Archipelago, to declare that the President clearly abused his discretion when he considered the emergency not ended at the time he promulgated the executive orders now questioned.
Though the style was an adaptation of one popular in early Medieval Europe, in the hands of Richardson and his followers (including Frank Lloyd Wright’s mentor, Louis Sullivan) it became truly Americanized, allowing for a play with interior space and form unlike that seen in American architecture up to that point. In a sense then, Romanesque Revival as a style was the great-grand-daddy of American modernism.

Why the theological yap-yap-yap? Because I believe that our human relationships are absolutely vital to our progression and our becoming more like our Father. I also believe that when a person is embroiled in a feud with the next door neighbor over where they park their camper, or saying unkind things about a sister, that they are stunting themselves. There is no joy in contention or fear. It's my oh-so-esteemed opinion that since we are all here in this mortal realm for such a short time trying to learn the pro-active art of "having joy" in the midst of heartbreak, hunger, tragedy and sorrow, it would behooves us to foster friendship and kind feelings wherever we can.

Conformers: Problems may seem too big, too overwhelming, or may be viewed as someone else’s mess to fix. Conforming eliminates personal accountability, may seem like the easier thing to do, and feel the safest because implementing change or becoming uncomfortable wouldn’t be necessary. Sometimes conforming is just accepting that this is the way it is, so instead of going against the grain, we might as well give up and join ‘em.

As each 24-hour period passes, the recovering person, sometimes unbeknownst to themselves, is slowly improving in almost every area of their lives. The alcoholic recognizes that abnormal drinking is only one of the symptoms of this complex disease, a symptom that seems to point to a personal maladjustment to life. Hence, alcoholics are apt to be emotional, immature, and sensitive, seeking to escape the often harsh realities of life.

In any case, despite these problems, a positive point may be noted: celerity.

I must say, I’m quite proud of this blanket. It’s already wrapped and ready to be delivered to my Okinawan grandmother for Christmas. Now the only problem I have is determining what I’ll (try to) make next. Any suggestions?
One day that I particularly enjoyed was Saturday January 21st. The main idea of it was that sometimes we treat God like a heavenly ATM. We come to him with all of our wants and requests and expect Him to full those desires instantly. It was a nice reminder to praise God first because we, as sinners, don't really deserve anything, but God still provides bountiful blessings upon our lives in spite of sinfulness.

Please, everyone, don't let this happen. Blog and rant about libraries and cuts. Write to politicians. I did last night. And if you know people who have already blogged, please put links to them in the comments below. I'll then transfer them into this post.
One must remember that Paul attacked the practice in 2 Thess. 2:2, 3:17 during his own life. Also, pseudepigraphal works introduce new teaching, which 2 Peter does not[95]. Not only does 2 Peter lack new teaching, but one struggles to find a motive for the pseudepigrapher. Zahn comments on this, writing “To reconstruct at a later time, from hints in Jude and from imagination, a lost apostolic prophecy concerning future errors, which, according to Jude, was actually fulfilled in the apostolic age, would have been a task as purposeless as it was difficult.”[96] A pseudepigrapher has no motive, and if Peter is pseudonymous, the author is a “hypocrite as well as a liar”.[97] One would be hard pressed to argue that hypocrisy and deceit are not a good way to establish credibility with the early church.
So a quick flip to the cover flap reveals the following copy:
Red flag #3: Stealth agents. Googling the names of the four agents who are supposedly part of this agency turns up nothing whatsoever related to writing or publishing. This might be understandable if the agents were new--but for the kind of experience that's being claimed (15 years, in one case), it's a tad implausible.
Each page holds another bookish voice, introducing some aspect of one of our most favorite things—books! I just want to tell about each poem! There are books that tell certain uncomfortable things that happen to them, like when someone falls asleep on them, or the worst, when “wet” happens. There are those that speak of unhappiness, like being the book’s middle, instead of first or last. Laura’s words show well that she really has crawled INSIDE books in order to speak for them.

Some of my readers may be wondering...what happened to the other aspects of my blog? like beauty and hair, etc...well, I am not a theme blogger, so I blog about a variety of topics. I blog about things that I love and loathe. That being said, I realized it's been a minute since I've blogged on anything beauty related. As much as I love beauty, makeup and all...I just have been in a rut. It's an overall rut. I wore makeup for the first time in a while this weekend for my friends bridal shower. Well not the first time, but it was my first time going to one of my favorite NYX eyeshadow palettes. It was nostalgic.
For my sister-in-law's birthday, my mom and I wanted to make her a different dinner. I had shown her some recipes for Chinese Marbled Tea Eggs, which got my attention and hers as well. So, I decided to make them for her birthday dinner, with Chinese fried rice.
The word “deliberate” in the above definition is the only word that throws a spanner in the works. All the other terms tally 100 percent with what is happening in South Africa at this very moment. The word “deliberate”, however, has bearing on the conscious intent of the perpetrators. It thus creates a loophole which the criminals and the government can rely on to effectively shift the spotlight away from genocide, and to thus blame the killings on other factors such as crime, poverty, etc. How many times has Malema, for example, said that chanting the words “Kill the Boer” has caused no harm? How many times have we heard the savage killers (the few that get arrested), say in court, “we never acted deliberately,”?

Privet House looks like Anthropologie on steroids, they have a curiosity shop appeal, so expect leather suitcases, drip candles, and a few things that are avocado coloured and a bit creepy. Gosh, that sounds like my apartment.

For those of you who don’t know me, I am a very caring person. I believe everyone should be treated with respect and animals should be loved dearly (Yes, I was a vegetarian for a few years). And I am not just saying “I am a caring person” and then go behind someone’s back and gossip about how dumb they are. I was and always will have this love for everyone…which brings me to the next thing.

Some humans, of course, exploit this confusion by becoming multi-lingual. Like parrots, they thrive on hearing foreign words and repeating them frequently. An example of such is Rianhan Brooksbank-Jones, a pretty polyglot with a peculiar obsession about Korea. Her fascination with their oriental tongue is so great that she is having her own tongue surgically lengthened to speak it with greater fluency.

Telephones were treated differently then. In our home the telephone was a tool for adults. As children, we seldom used it. If mother was there, she would answer it. We answered it only when she was away. And we never answered the telephone at Grandma’s house.

I’ve been an admirer of DeLillo’s for a while, but never before have I been sucked into his world so completely as I did while reading Libra. More focused than the sprawling Underworld (though it does contain that breathtaking prologue) and less zany than White Noise (indeed, this book is as airtight and humorless as they come), this fictionalized account of the Kennedy assassination is a taut, frighteningly plausible re-imagining of the event that “broke the back of the American century.” And it seems to me that it’s the perfect representation of everything DeLillo is about.
Now imagine that the kids in the kinder class took the same attitude. “I’m pretty happy reading picture books, playing in the sand pit and not washing my hands a lot; might just stick at this level”. Luckily for them (and for us) they possess a natural curiousity for the big wide world around them. This thirst for knowledge means that they read increasingly difficult books with bigger and bigger words and they learn to write their names more legibly. They make the leap to the third rung of the monkey bars and they keep getting scraped knees until they can ride a bike or a scooter.

The legacy of “global warming” has been the decades-long attack on U.S. energy sources until today our vast resources of coal and oil remain in the ground instead of being available as the price of oil increases due to troubles in the Middle East and the cost of electricity increases due to laws mandating that utilities must buy from wind and solar electricity producers who would be out of business by next week without those government mandates.

An alligator glided quietly into the water from a few yards away. It was a big bull – easily twelve feet long from nose to tail. It’s tail swung in an almost leisurely manner propelling it through the water with hardly a sound. Only its nose, eyes and a few of the scutes on its back protruded from the murky water. Despite its lack of speed, the gator obviously swam with a purpose.

I feel like a hobo right now, migrating from place to place in search of warmth and electricity. This morning I was at the gym (hello, hot shower).

After that, home to my dark, chill house, which at noon was actually colder inside than out. It may be Thursday or Friday before power returns, but my fingers are crossed that when I get home tonight I'll see the porch light on. Wish me luck.

Since the launch of the New iPad (3rd Generation), Apple reduces the price of iPad 2 and making the 16GB version of iPad 2 the only version available now. The good news is not only the price reduction of the iPad 2 to a mere starting price of RM1199, but some variant of these models boast an improved battery life. These variant of iPad 2 are modified internally to get a more advanced 32-nanometer version of the dual-core A5 processor instead of a 45-nanometer chip in the previous iPad 2, according to Anandtech.

Hi Everyone!! Long time, no blog! Well, everything is going just fine and dandy. I'm healthy and happy, and just ran a half marathon the other day. 13.1 miles, baby!! And since I have decided to focus on my health and my family, I have made the decision to "retire" from teaching and kit making. But not from crafting - I'll be getting back into scrapping for my own family soon.
I've seriously neglected updating my blogs this past couple of months. The reason is that I've started to take on more freelance graphic design work and I'm having trouble balancing all the things I need to do in a day. Blogging, sadly, has slipped down the list. I would love to sit in my studio all day sewing and embroidering and making new products for Primrose. But the simple truth is that I'm not making enough money doing it. With the poor economy, people aren't shopping as much. And prices for everything (except, strangely enough, my garbage collection, which is $3 less per month - yeah!) have gone up dramatically.

2008 opened similarly to 2007, with the emergence of another strong rival. But this time the rival was a countryman as Usain Bolt exploded on the scene early with runs of 9.76 (Kingston), 9.92 (Port of Spain) and a WR 9.72 (New York) – with Gay running 9.85 in the New York race. Neither of the three met until Olympic Trials time. At US Trials Gay ran 9.77 (new AR) and 9.68w – then saw his season effectively put to bed with his injury in the 200. At Jamaica’s Trials it was Bolt over Powell (9.85 to 9.97). and the official changing of the hierarchy in Jamaica. Powell’s next race in Rome saw him pull up with a hamstring injury, but return 11 days later to edge Bolt (9.88 to 9.89) in Stockholm. Powell would not face Bolt again until Beijing, but continued with wins in London (9.94) and Monaco (9.82) before placing 5th in Beijing (9.95). Powell once again missed the Zurich race against his Beijing conquerors (Bolt/Thompson/Dix/Martina), but did find his way to Lausanne and a 9.72 PR win minus Bolt.

Just add enough olive oil until you reach a thicker green sauce or until it is to your liking. Check with a spoon for the right consistency. I used up 150 ml. Now, add the seasoning. Add some grins of black pepper & some sea salt flakes. Blitz again & again. Taste! It has to taste fab! Adjust the seasoning if you need to but don’t forget that the capers & the anchovy will already be salty ! Set aside & spoon into a fitting bowl.
2. How do you fellowship with one another? Are you spending more time away from your wife and talking about your wife to your friends than you are her? Women, are you spending more time at your prayer group talking to them about your husband instead of talking to him? Men, what have you placed as priority in front of your wife? Women, are you children top priority over your husband? Just because you may be a mother doesn’t mean you stop being a wife. God first, Husband & Marriage second, Kids third….so many marriages are destroyed because of the priority of the kids have become first…Let me just ask this question…do you really want your kids to grow up in a broken marriage so they can learn from your example? Is that the priority you want for your children? If your marriage is going to make it you have to fellowship with one another. Jesus own words…where two or more are gathered in my name I am THERE…

Shedloads of books and articles have been written about the Victorian loss of faith and the tendency of those who believe in nothing to believe in everything, but Conan Doyle, after all, was the creator of the ultimate, rational problem-solving machine, who refused to believe in the supernatural, and who didn’t have the slightest problem with ‘crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of evil are exalted’. Exposure to theosophy didn’t apparently lead very far at the time – Doyle became ‘suspicious of the Blavatsky cult’ – but Drayson, a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society was one of a large number of trained scientists who spent a lot of time trying to reconcile observed ‘psychic’ phenomena (or phenomena believed to have been observed) with the laws of biology and of physics.
I missed my flight sitting in the terminal. I was not listening to headphones, I was not distracted. I did not fall asleep.

Guardrisk Insurance company consultant Wally Thom warns in a report in Beeld newspaper today that kidnappiungs, and abductions for ransom are soaring in South Africa – yet more than seventy percent of these cases are never reported to the SAPS and oreover, people often don’t obtain the services of experts to help them bring their kidnapping-ordeals to a safe conclusion.
For the other half, you need to move on to step two. Ask yourself, what is the worst possible thing that can happen if this fear or worry becomes true? Make a list, yes, write it down on paper underneath your clearly defined worry. Keep writing down everything that comes to mind until you have identified the worst possible outcome. Do you realize that 90% of what we worry about never happens? Think about how much time you spend on worrying about stuff that never will happen. This list will help you see that.
So, in other words, you select all the files, and drag them into the clips pane, where they’re not in the movie yet, but they’ve already been imported. You can’t put them directly in the animation, because imovie messes up the order, so it goes: 1, 4, 7, 3, 9, 2, 6, 5, etc. In the movie timeline, it’s really hard to reorder things, because when you move one way, then you have to go back to put in, but the clips pane scrolls separately from the timeline. Also, unlike the regular style, I can blog while I import, instead of having to wait, then drag, then wait, then drag, then wait, then drag, then wait, then drag then wait, then drag, then wait, then drag, then wait, then drag, then wait, then drag, then, wait, then drag, then wait, then drag, etc.
Bottom line: Shades of Milk and Honey, the novel advertised as “Jane Austen with magic”, has something deeper and more Gothic to it that elevates it above its concept–as well as the winningly organic romance between the heroine and her suitor and Kowal’s refreshing blend of Austenian style and modernity. Know any Austen fans who need to be introduced to speculative fiction? This might be just the right book for the job.
Next to that was a smaller pool that we called the new pool and was one that was only five feet deep and usually used more by older members. Near the larger pool was a snack bar that sold potato chips, sodas and candy products and beside it was a small basketball court and a slab of concrete with one wall where some played handball. And scattered around the grassy areas were several multi-colored triangular wooden objects we called dog houses.

Well, reader–I, for one, am offended by your blatant disregard for potheads’ cultural customs. Regardless, cats aren’t even “smarter” than dogs (thanks for including sources for your information).
I woke up this morning to a grey, gloomy and rainy view out my window and decided it was an Oats day. I'm just beginning to experiment with different recipes and approaches to the best bowl of oatmeal, since for pretty much my entire life "oatmeal" meant the instant, microwavable variety that seemed to always turn to mush. Over the years I'd learned to spice up my instant oats to something a little tastier, but I'd never, until this year, experimented with stovetop, rolled oats. Here we go!
Jarrod and I had my cousin, Brett, and his wife, Kim, over for dinner last night. They are currently raising their support for CRU (formerly known as Campus Crusade for Christ) and wanted to meet with us to share what God has been doing this past year and what their plans are for the future. I have so much fun having friends and family over to our house. Not only do I get to use some of our wedding gifts, but I also get to visit and hear what is happening in their lives. It was so wonderful to hear Brett and Kim's stories and see their passion for ministry. If anyone is interested in learning more about CRU or feels led to help them raise their support, let me know or leave a comment.
That should get the journalists' "expert statisticians" going. She'll make her fortune, if she can do it.
And returning once more to our first meaning of real joy (true faith via submitting to Jesus Christ’s headship over the body) by acknowledging the Son’s headship and submitting to serving Him, we gain peace within our own spirit (Romans 15:13; 1 Corinthians 14:33; Hebrews 12:11). Then by following (submitting to; serving and mimicking) Christ’s example to serve others, we remain at peace with our brothers and sisters resulting in our own spirit being at peace with God and ourselves (Ephesians 4:3-6; 1 Thessalonians 5:12-13; Hebrews 12:14).

So, have I any criticisms to make? Well, there’s Lucy! I have to confess that I have never been a fan of Miss Ball. Even as a youngster her TV shows irritated the hell out of me, now that I’m all grown up I find her even less appealing. While I watched this film, I found myself thinking that almost any other actress would have preferable in the role of the resourceful girl friday.
In the second game, the victorious Vikings waged war on Arthur’s Arab Conquest army. I think this was the first time against the Arab’s and I expected to have my work cut out in this one.

When I first moved to Virginia I got a job teaching at a local technical college. During my time with these particular students I had a chance to listen to some of their stories of life in a small Southern town. Hearing those stories helped me to create the character of Hattie, the ghost in Signs of the South.

In that same vein I’m hoping to encourage participation from some of us bloggers who tend to avoid posting work on-line.

The original title of this blog was going to be something along the lines of “Why the U.S Isn’t Going to Help Chen Guangcheng.” But it turns out that, according to the New York times, at least, Chen Guangcheng is “in American hands somewhere in Beijing”. So, the United States is officially interfering. Hmm…

Of course, I am not the only who believes in the necessity of education. Nearly thirty percent of American Indians between the ages 18 to 24 are currently enrolled in college, a number that has doubled since 1980. As we work to encourage more Indigenous Peoples to attend college, we also have to be mindful of tuition costs and the costs it takes to offer a quality education. These questions certainly inform the fact that we are in the beginning stages of what is arguably a massive transformation in the higher education experience. Due to online technologies, for example, colleges are rethinking their academic infrastructures in order to best serve the upcoming student bodies. Stanford University has begun to offer free classes. Open Courseware is maintained by several universities and the Kuhn Academy is gaining in popularity. Perhaps these and other activities will point the way to an educational experience that keeps its relevancy to and affordability for our communities.

So, alongside Lani is Mary Kallhoff, the person who now bullies and alienates fans by blocking them from the street team Facebook page, after calling it ‘her’ page. I’m sorry, sister, but since when did YOU own the street team or the right to the 100 Monkeys name/brand? I’m guessing never. Mary was left with the bulk of the work after Adrienne, the previous street team director fucked up royally. However, power doesn’t give you the right to treat fans like she has. Clearly, it’s gone to her head. Being in Lani’s back pocket does that to you, I suppose.

Crush the garlic gloves and add them to the pan. Add the lemon quarters, cherry tomatoes and sprinkle with the chopped parsley. Add the wine, drizzle with some more olive oil and bake for 20 – 25 minutes. Serve with rice or couscous.
It would be so great to have some partners to take this challenge with me and keep each other going.

I am also beginning to accept that Bok Choy is one of those tasteless food items which will take the flavor of whatever you cook with it and the recipe with balsamic vinegar and lemon was quite good. It finally dawned on me that very small changes in the ingredients make a huge difference in flavor and you can still avoid excess salt. With this in mind, it was time for me to revisit the Smoked Turkey and Bok Choy that was just OK.

When I was in grad school, I had to read Kazuo Ishiguro's novel Never Let Me Go for a Contemporary British Fiction course. Talk about a trip! I was familiar with his other novel, Remains of the Day, with its quiet reserve and social conversation. That was what I expected with this newest novel, but that is not quite the direction it headed in.

Ted Milligan had a gift for drawing, and when he arrived in a POW camp in June 1944 after being shot down over France, he realised that the one thing he now had was 'endless time'. He met an artist called Adrian Heath, and realised that this was his chance; with Adrian's help, he could practise his drawing, using the camp and all that was in it and around it as subject matter.
The sculpture at BBG is woven from nonnative woody material that was collected from Ocean Breeze Park on Staten Island. The harvesting site was chosen by BBG's director of Science because of its proximity to the Garden and its large population of nonnative willow (Salix atrocinerea), which is designated an invasive species in New York State. Removal of saplings of this species helped protect the site's excellent assemblage of herbaceous plants. The park is owned by the City of New York and is targeted for restoration under the City's PlaNYC sustainability initiative.

All perfect shades and products that could be used for the next day's photos, and enclosed with a sweet note and a heart, to boot.

Bri and her mom decide to put the baby bed together. Somehow this ends up with Bri having a bloody toe and MTV decides to show a fairly gnarly close up. For - in my mind - what seems like an extended amount of time. WHY, MTV? WHY? Bloody feet gross me out more than anything else in the world and I'm tempted to turn the channel. The bloody toe (*harf*) evolves into a discussion about all the disgusting things babies do. Sister Britt is in the room at this point and the conversation turns to her abortion and how she can't ever take it back. There are tears, on her part, as she explains it's hard to watch Briana go through pregnancy. She knows it'll be hard seeing Bri with the baby as well. There's a lot of tension between the sisters. Part of me feels sorry for Brittany and I wish we knew a little more about her story. Did she feel forced into abortion? Did she feel it was her only alternative? On the other hand, she needs to just stop taking it out on Bri that Bri decided to keep her baby.
One thing I found interesting was the undercurrent of intensity in the crowd watching the action. The players acted with purpose and intent, but that is to be expected. What struck me was you could also describe many of the spectators as watching with purpose and intent.

While on my bicycle I am able to admire the plants and animals on a much greater degree than if I were in a car. Every morning I begin my journey out of my apartments and on to the country club path leading me to Starker park. I have become aware that as soon as I enter the park and on to the path that there is an elderly man slowly hobbling along with his cane trailing behind his significant other who is walking their fierce fuzzy pet. The first time I passed this couple I hesitated and was charged by their vicious companion. Now that I am aware of his intentions I howl my approach “Excuse me!” and speed past without giving the mini hound any chance. Onward the path leads through the woods and tall grass I did once notice a dead mouse. I realized that even bicycles have the potential to cause havoc among the creatures that live near the path. As for when it rains, I find it almost amusing to avoid all of the giant slugs that slide along the path. Its only been two weeks and my short adventure to and from school always seems to keep me surprised.

I have put the lights on the back of the ambulance to low spots. The hope was that with the extra dose of Lorazepam, the early hour and the rocking motion of the ambulance, Saskia might fall asleep. But the reality is that if anything the drug has made her more volatile. Despite everything the mother can do to calm her – cradling her on her lap, stroking her hands and head, singing to her, kissing her head, rocking her gently like a poorly child – Saskia is blazing like a preacher inhabited by terrors. What makes it even harder to manage is those moments when she lapses into a whimpering kind of cry, followed by a sudden coming-to, a clear re-emergence of the girl that was. Now and again she straightens on the trolley, smiles, wipes her eyes with both hands and smiles freely and easily.
All along this wonderful and emotional journey, there have been many timelines and Divine deadlines and dates set forth for these changes to happen, and all of them have been aligned with your Cosmic Calendar and with the Divinely sanctioned and ordained schedule of when these events can be manifested but wouldn’t quite need to be, as well as when these events were nearer to needing to be manifested and when these events would absolutely need to manifest as Gaia truly cannot wait any longer.

We were on a tight schedule this day and our biggest mistake was not eating before we went to the cemetery! It was a long ride and we thought we'd get something at the cemetery. Well, food is not allowed at the cemetery. And, we were there for hours even though we 'hurried.' One of the girls in our group had her blood sugar crashing and her mom talked one of the employees into getting some food (from his own stash). But, the rest of us went HUNGRY.
Jake had practice last night, so Matt and I headed to get groceries and grabbed some Mexican food. I got beans with a side of beans topped with guacamole and a little bitty cheese enchilada-it was smaller than a deck of cards. I really need to learn what is best to eat when we are out and about. I know fries are a non-food, burger buns are too much bleached flour. Fried stuff is no good...so, what does that leave, here in the South-sans going to a larger city? There's only so many Fresco bean burritos I can eat from Taco Bell. We have split a bag of carrot sticks and a protein plus drink from the grocery store more than once.
And I’m not sure I can change that now. The last thing I want to be is milquetoast. I don’t want to pursue a little bit of anything.

So, I decided to explore purchasing special lighting. Now, I love blogging - don't get me wrong. But it is a hobby, not a profession for me. So, I do need to keep that in perspective. The cost of special photography lighting? Quite a bit. More than I wanted to spend, anyway. But I didn't give up hope ...

Swallow me up, and drink me cold, I have nothing left and nothing to give. I feel less and I hate more, I’ve grown an anger that can’t be subdued, for you it’s the last call before the fall. Are you afraid? I’m to be slain, no glimmer of hope, this it for most. Parade around in your glamorous life, sink away the life you’ve been given, take time and soak in your riches.

Basically, it’s two pockets, one has laminated cards that list different menu ideas. One side of the card will have a complete meal on it (lunch or dinner – I’m thinking of colour coding them) and the other side of the card will list the ingredients that I need to have (not the staples I always have on hand like flour). I plan on going through these cards for inspiration when I’m making my meal plan. The other pocket has blank papers for my grocery list as well as a weekly menu list. I will then stick the filled out weekly menu in the middle so that I can easily see what’s up and prepare for the next day.

After giving up the 1 unearned run in the first, Hong pitched marvelously and to the delight of the firecracker throwing fans had a 1 hitter going into the 6th inning. He was wild though and had put 2 Senators on the bases after hitting them with pitches. Now taking the mound in the 6th Hong fell victim to the Oaks lousy fielding. A cheap infield single by Cal Lahman followed by Alex Kampouris' hit put runners on first and second. Perhaps unnerved by the developments, Hong then drilled Ray French in the ribs to load the bases with no outs. Kettle Wirts hit an easy double play ball to shortstop Greg Mulleavy but he bobbled it and a run crossed the plate with only one out. Nushida's replacement, pitcher Lefty Vinci slugged a base clearing triple and Hong was taken out of the game. Hong had lasted 5 1/3 innings, gave up 4 hits, walked 4 and got charged with 2 earned runs and was tagged with the loss as the Senators went on to beat Oakland 7 to 5.
Warner recalled the Mayo Clinic had done some research looking at the epidemiology of learning disorders in children born from 1976 to 1982 in Rochester, Minn. Out of the 341 cases they reviewed, children with no anesthesia exposure or just a single exposure to anesthesia had ADHD at a rate of about 7.3 percent. Children who had two or more exposures had ADHD at a rate of 17.9 percent. The researchers also tried to adjust for other risk factors, such as gestational age, sex, birth weight, and comorbid health conditions.

I cut out different sizes of circles in the burlap and fabric.. I made the burlap circles largest, the burgundy a bit smaller, and then the printed fabric I did a bit differently. I didnt use regular scissors. I used wavy edge scissors for those.. Then I sewed the circles together in the middle. Once that was done I added my beads.. Luck had it that I had some burgundy beads shaped like flowers. I glued those to the center of the fabric flowers. Then I glued my burlap and fabric flowers into the wreath, adding one to the inside of the doily also.
In between bites of couscous salad and artisanal potato chips purchased at a nearby shop, Mais Oui Paris and I admired the "People's Tuileries" that Napoleon III created for the underprivileged citizens of Eastern Paris in 1867. Built on the site of disused gypsum quarries, the 1963 Les Guides Bleus: Paris describes Buttes-Chaumont as "certainly one of the most pleasant and unexpected parks of the capital", while the 2011 Paris by Rick Steves doesn't seem to mention it at all. What an oversight.
I’d probably make a good census worker. I’m really good at counting stuff. When I was a kid back in the 1960s, it was one of my major hobbies, right up there with being lonely and having pimples. I’d count oncoming cars during the annual vacation drive from Florida to Pennsylvania. I’d spend entire afternoons rolling dice with alternate hands, tabulating which one could come up with the highest cumulative numbers (one memorable match from August of 1966 saw the right hand edge the left by a score of 3,468 to 3,462 in a legendary contest the old-timers still recall today).

Whitney Houston’s story offers life lessons for all children and adults — not just those pursuing entertainment careers. In all kinds of professional industries, people are usually perceived to be only as good as their last achievement. It is ingrained in us that we have to constantly have one more success. Unfortunately, people feel they have to be better than their latest accomplishment or performance. But honestly, in the case of Whitney Houston, how could she top her rendition of the National Anthem at the 1991 Super Bowl? Or how could she top her biggest hit, I Will Always Love You?

Estée Lauder was driven by the desire to create a sporty scent that was sophisticated without being overwhelming; a fragrance befitting the tennis court and the gym. The concept was clear, but the execution was decidedly complex, resulting in a formula that included over 300 ingredients. The fragrance pyramid for Aliage varies slightly, depending on the source. In Fabulous Fragrances II author Jan Moran provides these key notes: Greens, Peach and Citrus in the top, Jasmine, Rosewood, Pine and Thyme in the heart, and Oakmoss, Musk, Vetiver and Myrrh in the base.

Often philosophers of a theologically orthodox persuasion will speak about how some worlds are logically possible for God to create without them being feasible for God to create (which is equivalent to saying that God cannot ensure the reality of the intended possible world). One example might be a world in which every free person freely chooses to not sin at every occasion when that choice presents itself. That is a logically possible world, and one which God can create. However, it isn’t a feasible world for God to create – since it is not logically possible for God to make anybody freely do anything.
SB 10.88.10: A person who has thus become sober fully realizes the Absolute as the highest truth, the most subtle and perfect manifestation of spirit, the transcendental existence without end. In this way realizing that the Supreme Truth is the foundation of his own existence, he is freed from the cycle of material life.
When we read a book in reading class, we have a certain schedule to follow so we read a few chapters at a time. We had a week to read chapters 1 to 7. In addition to our reading assignments we had comprehension questions and a "reading check" to make sure we read the book and understand what we read. My grades on the comprehension and "reading checks" ranged from 90 to 100. I think by my grades you can tell I enjoyed the book immensely... I learned the names for different rooms of the household and public areas. A triclinium is a dining room and a solarium is a room in public baths used for resting, reading and beauty treatments. Finally, the most interesting piece of information that I learned is what it was like for the people and slaves of Pompeii after the eruption of Vesuvius.

We tried something new this time with spacers. Normally, I frame without glass or acrylic, but my cousin asked if we could put something over the stitching to keep it cleaner. Since we were framing without a mat, I did a little reading on the site and found the spacers. They come in long sticks that are easy to cut and fit into the frame, and worked like a charm to provide an air space between the acrylic (most online places will not sell and ship glass) and the stitching itself. Now that we know how well it works, I'll definitely be doing it again for a few pieces I plan on hanging in our kitchen. They won't be right near the sink or stove, but I'd like to give them that extra layer of protection anyway.

I realize I haven't taken a waltz around the blogosphere lately - or even a crawl - but I hadn't realized how far behind I was until I sat down to write this post today! Holy crow I missed a lot of stuff! Obviously, I can't recap all of it here - that would take pages and pages of writing that I frankly don't have time for - but I settled for sharing great posts that have hit the blogosphere in the last six hours.
The gardens are just greening up now from their winter’s sleep, but the promise that they show, of color and form and graceful waving beauty, is evident already, and once again, my daughter smiled her smile.

There is a general assumption that the manner of a man's life is a clue to what he on reflection regards as the good - in other words happiness.
Keiser was a well travelled man, a Wehrmacht veteran, wanted for fraud in Germany, married in Jordan, wanted for passport tampering in Morocco, worked undercover in a police sting in Bogota, arrested for real estate swindling in Belize, etc. In New York City, a more infamous felon was arrested while having dinner with Keiser at “21″, as part of another police sting in which Keiser was an undercover participant. Carol Bruce, a legal assistant on Barcella’s staff, would refer to him as “Bela”, as in Bela Lugosi. Keiser was now facing deportation from the US after it was discovered the New York hospital he claimed to have been born in had no records of his birth, and neither did the city of New York. Keiser played his best hand, pleading for a stay if he could help bring in Wilson, now a well-known fugitive, back to the US.

In a statement released to the media, a CGH spokesperson praised Dr Ngeow for being an ‘excellent’ doctor loved by his colleagues and patients alike and he remained very much ‘part of the team’.
He’d come back to look at the scared earth left from the fire. The scene of the crime. And she’d watch him on other days and she would try to call the police on her cell phone every time. But it would just start to ring, but then it would stop and disconnect. The call wouldn’t go through. And he would move off down the street.

Now that you are getting to know me you have probably realized that my imagination far outstretches my skill. In this last piece I decided to experiment with my sparkly Sakura gel pens. The result is a bit garish in person, for once I am glad that the camera tones the image down. :-) Oh well, It Is What It Is!

While preparing for a tour in support of Harvest, Crazy Horse guitarist (of Neil Young’s backing band) Danny Whitten was fired from the band due to his inability to function properly in band rehearsals due to his drug use, shortly after he was found dead of a drug overdose. The vicious combination of success and loss changed something in Neil and it subsequently resulted in a series of three albums that at the time were not commercially or critically successful, often referred to as “The Ditch Trilogy”. The situation at the time can be best described by Neil Young himself as written in the linear notes to his 1977 compilation album Decade when discussing the song “Heart of Gold”:
I spent many of summer days

The demand for the single, only available on 12″ initially, was so great that there were literally people lined up at the ferry docks in England waiting with cash in hand to buy copies as soon as they arrived from France. The tune would eventually sell over 1 MILLION COPIES ON VINYL (let’s see that happen today) and let’s not forget the success it had with the CD single version (first disc in my CD wallet, every time). I even went out and tracked down the Chaka Khan album the sample came from, What’cha Gonna Do For Me. Great album, BTW.
For my final artwork today I'm working on the large Lavender Flower Fairy by Stamps Happen. My sky is BG10, one of my favorite sky colors. Because the fairy is interrupting the big blue sky, I start in the bottom left corner and work my way around. Then I come back and work from the middle, then the bottom right side of the tall stalk. You can't see the next step, but because the lavender at the bottom is hard to distinguish from the sky, I just colored my sky right over the top (since blue is part of green). Notice also that I feathered in some BG93 along the bottom to give the sky around the lavender a bit of depth.
Dearest Snow,

One day, in the Paris Subway, the Metro, I witnessed a perfect example of a healing. At the height of the rush hour, a woman in front of me lost all her oranges from a broken bag. “Voila!” (Oh just see), she cried in dismay as she saw the fruit rolling in every direction among the feet of the commuters. Wonder to behold, in their rush, people stopped to pick up the oranges and brought them back to the distraught woman. At the sight of all the fruit once again in her arms, she burst out with cries of joy, “Merci, merci!” (Thanks, thanks!). A true healing had taken place. All the parts came back to form a wholeness. A splintered heart was renewed!

Coming after “The Da Vinci Code”, this book was bound to generate lot of interest and it did become very popular but it is definitely not the same, specifically due to the final climax which leaves everybody desiring for something else. “The Lost Symbol” by Dan Brown is once again a thriller where his earlier hero Robert Langdon is trying to figure out the symbolism and code words in a chase where he is being threatened for his life. Dan Brown has the knack of creating chapters that reveal his story bit by bit and at the end of the chapter leaves you asking for more. It is extremely difficult to keep down the book once you start reading it.

Hello and Happy Hump Day! I have been very busy today. I went to the Orthopedist for a recheck on my Tennis Elbow and also had to take my son Collin to the dentist to have 2 teeth pulled. That was the last of his baby teeth. They just didn't want to let go. Next step is braces. I made 2 cards today, only one which I can share with you now. I decided to play along with this month's PTI Blog Hop. I was just looking through my cards the other day wondering if there were things I would change now. I am my own worst critic.
Concert. I've been at another festival next day, on Saturday, with a friend of mine and her friend. I wasn't that much of a Razorlight-fan, just knew some songs, but whooo, they were awesome live. Plus the bassist was so strange and funny :D I guess the song I'm posting here was one of my favourites, first of all because of the lyrics. North London Trash also was awesome, In The City strange, disturbing but interesting, as a summary I thought everything sounded waaaay better live than on the records I heard. One thing that bothered me was just how Johnny looked like that day. Sick and ill somehow. Huge lacrimal sacs and shadows under his eyes, very pale... however, his voice was awesome, he jumped down the stage that was too high (I was standing first row and just saw heads and shoulders, not only 'cause I'm short), ran through the audience, I even had to help him climb over the fence again (grabbed his leg 'cause he was almost fallin' down :D poor guy). Another thing that scared me were the great balloons that some guys threw into the audience. I've got a natural fear from balls and stuff (broke my nose once because a football hit my nose and glasses) and the guy next to me had his elbows on the same height as my face was and he always grabbed the balloons...
The annoyed salesperson rolls her eyes, sighs, and answers:

When Christ first appeared among His Apostles after His death and Resurrection, His first act was to breathe upon them and to say: Receive ye the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). He could say and do this at that point because He had purified them by His sacrifice on the Cross; He had loosed them from sin. And then, after He had ascended to heaven and seated our human nature on the right hand of the Father, Christ sent down the Holy Spirit on His Apostles at Pentecost, as He had promised.
2. Size matters. Although your new puppy may be a small bundle of joy right now, in six months you may be dealing with a monster. If you don’t have a lot of space, or if you live in an apartment, a large breed may not be the best choice. In addition to space constraints, it is also a good idea to remember that large dogs do eat quite a bit more than the average teacup poodle and if you’re on a tight budget, a smaller dog will be more economical.
For this months Random Recipe Challenge, Dom decided to mix things up a little bit. We each had to select the 18th book in our collection and select something from that to cook. Book number 18 for me is Donna Hay's 'Simple Essentials - Chicken', oh how I wish the number had been number 17, then I would of got Donna Hay's 'Simple Essentials - Chocolate'!!! But I wanted to do Dom's challenge justice this month seeing as I had slightly adjusted the rules last month and stuck fast to the chicken book. Keeping true to my blog I needed to find a baked recipe and Donna did not fail ... as if she ever would!

I planned the trip with my usual obsessive-compulsive care. Unfortunately, as I had almost completed making arrangements to visit four schools in three days, I found out that one of them was holding a special overnight-visit program for a lot of admitted students, and wasn't able to do tours or interviews the day we had hoped to be there. So we revised our driving route to go counterclockwise rather than clockwise, and reversed the order of the college visits -- to paraphrase Matthew 20:16, the last became first, and the first became last.

Today was one of those days. It was raining, it was cold. It was blah. After work, Julie said she was going to a powerflow class at Pure. I wasn’t sure I wanted to go. Actually, I knew I didn’t. It felt like a crash-on-the-couch-and-watch-a-movie day. Then Julie said we could go to Booster Juice, which is good, and that it was Jen’s class, which is great. I decided to go and just do what I could.
And that got me thinking – I’ve wanted to run a half marathon and a marathon for ages but never had the time/money/guts to do it. If my impending 30th could inspire me to do that, what else could it inspire me to do?
There was an "anything goes" ethic in play. The main idea was to do whatever it took to get patrons in the door and keep them there. Many of the drinking establishments during this period (the 1850's-1900's) were what were called "tied houses", which meant they were affiliated with a particular beer company. Due to the exclusive nature of their relationship with one specific brewer, their profit margins were very low, so there were a lot of frauds and scams happening in order to boost the bottom line.
My family has decided to cut back a bit on Christmas, so that we mainly buy one nice thing for one person, after we draw names out of a hat. And then we also buy a smaller gift, but we don't know who will get the smaller gift. So the spending limit with tax and everything ends up being just a bit under forty dollars per person, and should only require the one shopping trip. And all that is just fine, and I have most of a month to get that done.
My Shaw phone modem malfunctioned. I not only couldn’t make or receive calls, but nobody could buzz me from the front door of my building. I lived with this for a few days but I eventually had to make the 45 minute call to Shaw to get the modem replaced. Of course I had to make this call elsewhere than home.

But the regime's own actions disprove the charge of sectarianism. Its suppression of the opposition is totally indiscriminate; witness the horrific torture, murder and mutilation of Hamza Al Khateeb (picture above). The regime has killed at least 1,500 since the ‘Days of Rage’ in February, and in the last days of July, maybe thousands more. Promises of ‘new era’ democratic reforms, the lifting the state of emergency imposed in 1963, and planned negotiations, are just ruses to confuse and divide the opposition. These all failed as the demand of the opposition to ‘end the regime’ became more popular. But how to 'end the regime' is less straightforward. Meeting in Turkey on July 17 the external opposition couldn't agree on whether to form a alternative government or wait to see how the uprising went. But they all agreed that it was necessary to use 'civil disobedience' to achieve 'democracy'. Just what 'civil disobedience' means when innocent children are shot in the streets was not made clear.

It's expensive to live in Canada and immigration has not made that any better, indeed it has made the situation worse. But if Canadians realize their low standard of living in relation to previous generations has been influenced in part by immigration perhaps then they'll be compelled to do something about it.

Although some of these negative perceptions of the Whiteman are not entirely unfounded, I am not entirely convinced that factors such as the African Slave Trade, colonization, or racial discrimination, had any major impact on the degeneration of the Black African in the long run. I’m also not convinced that any of these aspects had anything to do with the fact that the Black African’s IQ is on average far lower than the White and Oriental Races. (See the article Race-mixing, IQ, and the Future on this blog for more info regarding the IQ issue.)

In January 2011, CNBC ran a special called “The Facebook Obsession,” the name of which represents the almost 1 billion people globally that use it.

Immediately after you or your loved one is hurt is the best time to contact a lawyer. If it is past that time, it is important to contact Dixon Law Office as soon as you can. There are time limits for you to bring all cases so it is urgent to contact a lawyer as soon as possible. Insurance companies start working on their claims immediately. You should, too. Do not delay.

Red Dust Road is about the author Jackie Kay’s search for her birth parents. We read about her childhood and the discoveries she makes along the way such as when she realises for the first time that she and her brother have a different skin colour to their parents. She also tells us the reasons behind wanting to know more about her birth parents right through to when she meets them in person. It’s a journey that takes her to various parts of Scotland, England and Nigeria and is a fast, touching and funny read.

Although Sword and Soul has roots in Sword-And-Sorcery, it has grown into something inclusive of the genre’s tropes, but quite different. As Sword and Soul author, Stafford Battle, puts it – “This is more than brown or black skinned Conans stomping through the dense jungle killing monsters. You will find no white Tarzan characters dominating the local natives. Sword & Soul – at least in one aspect – is the retelling of our African heritage as Kings and Queens, conquerors, explorers, warriors, and dreamers who influence the evolution of world civilization.”

Inori: She had NO personality. None. No character development. No backstory. Nothing. Her defining feature was dressing like a stripper all the time and whatever ‘cool’ thing the writers wanted her to do. Was I meant to care about her? I honestly can’t tell, because the writers never gave me anything to care about aside from the fact she was there. Her falling in love with Shu never felt really believable – she just kinda ends up having feelings and never explained why. And nothing even happens really in their relationship, so I couldn’t care about them as a couple either.

Now there’s Palin. In a bit of crude craft, she slyly compared Obama to Hitler by exhorting her twitter followers to read a recent column by right wing pseudo egg head writer Thomas Sowell. He pilloried Obama for arm twisting BP to set up the $20 billion escrow fund. The fund is to help repair and compensate the victims of its Gulf ruin. To Sowell Obama took another giant step toward seizing dictatorial power. There’s absolutely nothing new about this crackpot charge. It’s been an absolute smash favorite of fringe GOP congresspersons, tea party acolytes, Fox News and the menagerie of rightside talk show gabbers for two years. The Obama as Hitler idiocy is more than just the ancient and stock GOP tactic of smearing, slandering, name calling, character assassinating, and baiting liberal, and moderate Democrats. The tactic is used to prick primitive passions, and it allows the GOP to duck and dodge making a coherent case for its untenable and more often than not foolish positions on issues. No, the Hitler smear is coldly calculated, and strategically trotted out when Obama introduces a major piece of legislation, new policy initiative, or in his pre White House days, when his groundbreaking autobiography rocket launched him as a serious contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.

I knew from some earlier internet noodling that Trolley Square was home to at least one brewpub and eventually we wound our way upstairs where I found the Desert Edge Brewpub. I’m not able to find a website for them, so here, once again, is a Beer Advocate page, this time for Desert Edge.

The chapter that I read was Technology and Society by Raymond Williams. What this chapter discussed is how technology has begun to change the current culture. More specifically, how television has been one the most significant technology forms to cause this cultural change. This chapter discusses how TV is the medium through which ideas such as change and reformation are expressed and shared.
To make a 10 week story short, I took the high protein approach and drank two shakes a day for breakfast and lunch, two high protein snack in between and a healthy dinner of lean meat and vegetables. I also drank up to a gallon of water per day during this process, not to mention I added 3-5 workouts to my schedule per week, something that I had stopped doing over the past couple years prior.

Since everything was free, I decided to take a chance on my third free comic and go with one outside my usual reading zone. So....I picked up a Spider-man comic. Yup. Ok, this isn't a total wild card pick because it is written by Cullen Bunn of, wait for it, The Sixth Gun fame. Chances are I wont love it, but it'll make for some entertaining bathroom reading.

Laurel raised Tom’s pistol so that the barrel pointed directly at Craig’s forehead. She tapped him on the nose with the end of the barrel and he didn’t react but his eye locked on the two fat men behind her. His arm lifted and pressed against Laurel as if to move her out of the way. Craig stopped. He looked at her face and sniffed, then turned again to Tom and Peterson. Laurel pulled the trigger and where the top of Craig’s head had been there now a blasted mass of bone and brain with blobs of dripping red tissue sliding down. Craig’s body flopped back to the concrete.
Today I went to Salon Carolina to see my sister and to get my beauty on! I got my ususal: eyebrows waxed, a few foils, and a trim. The boys were with me so they joined in and got their handsome on with some sharp hair cuts.
Our guide later said that the weather we experienced was more on par with the turbulent season of August, when there are no tours. Predicting the weather atop the volcano is impossible and nothing below can accurately predict what will happen above. While the National Park itself was gorgeous, the páramo enchanting, and the climate a refreshing change from Cali, our volcano hike was more or less one of the more trying and uncomfortable experiences in recent memory. Actually I am not exaggerating when I say that the only sustained event I can think of in the last five years that was worse was when I contracted Dengue.
Lucky you citizen! You really do have a voice, comrade!
John’s first letter after his arrest was almost euphoric. He was ready to fight what were described as exaggerated charges. He had never been arrested before and felt that anything would be better than not being able see his family again or communicate with them. He would fight the extradition for the next three years while housed in La Sante.
The big number of zombie flicks that made a hit on the big screen is enough to prove that people would always find these ghastly characters interesting. The plot is always the same but people still watch for the heck of being scared.

What inevitably gets omitted from the textbook is any discussion, based in actual historical examples, of the way that free trade works out in practice That would be awkward, because in the real world, throughout history, free trade pretty consistently hasn’t done what Ricardo’s rhetoric and today’s economics textbooks claim it will do. Instead, it amplifies the advantages of wealthy nations and the disadvantages of poorer ones, concentrating capital and income in the hands of those who already have plenty of both while squeezing out potential rivals and forcing down wages across the board. This is why every nation in history that’s ever developed a significant industrial sector to its economy has done so by rejecting the ideology of free trade, and building its industries behind a protective wall of tariffs, trade barriers, and capital controls, while those nations that have listened to the advice of the tame economists of the British and American empires have one and all remained mired in poverty and dependence as long as they did so.

A few years ago my husband gave me a digital picture frame for my birthday and I hate to say it, but I never really used it. I just didn't like the way it looked. It was so plain and boring to look at. So lets fast forward five years and my whole opinion has changed. Why, because I saw something in a store that struck the creative side of me and completely changed my whole outlook on that digital frame sitting in my closet not being used. It was a FRAME....a custom made one to fit a digital frame. I saw it so long ago and I can't even remember where I saw it, but I remember I loved it and I wanted one and the store was asking an outlandish amount of money for it. When my parents were here this past week, I had my Dad build one for me.....because he can build anything (just wait until I post about an amazing Pottery Barn Teen knockoff he did for me....I'm working on that post)!

This one has been in my stash forever. It's a Limited Edition WhimZi from Just Nan called Cherub Garden. I'm in love with the little cherub and bluebird on the frame.

So what we’re left with is the modern (but also not-modern, as I shall explain) idea of schools-within-schools. You get the economies of scale on a macro-level, but on a micro-level each student feels like he or she is part of a smaller, more trusting community. Usually, schools-within-schools are divided up either by academic ability, or by Key Stage group. Unfortunately, both these methods are flawed.
Because Congress didn’t change the law to let states shift their comparison period back, more and more states will “trigger off” EB. The expectation now is that no state — or the District — will be able to offer the final 10 or 20 weeks of benefits by December.
Selecting a Color: It's hard to match fabric colors to your fabric sometimes. I find that a thread that is a little darker than your fabric won't be as noticible and prominent as thread that is lighter. When you can't find a color even mildly close to your fabric, try selecting a color that just looks nice with your fabric. Also remember thread color doesn't really matter that much in most cases since it isn't visible on the outside. If you're still learning and prone to messing up, you might want to use a contrasting color in non-visible places. It makes picking on your foul stitches much easier.

No, don’t even think about saying that insanity comment.)

Similarly this is the period when you will be breast feeding the baby.All that you eat will be passing on to the baby just as it did when it was inside you.Earlier the nutrients passed on to the baby through the placenta now it will pass on through the breast milk. Both the nutrients and the harmful substances including chemicals, drugs etc will pass on to the baby. So it is essential to watch what you eat.

In reality there are many kids today who don’t care much about Freedom Day, Father’s Day, Family Day, Youth Day, -- or whatever day it is, as long as it is NOT a School Day. School days are hated today with the same passion they were hated back in the 1970’s. It was this naive frailty of human nature, coupled with the ultimate satanic blood-sacrifice of ‘blameless’ kids, that was exploited by the communist forces back in 1976 to unleash a concoction of venomous chaos that spread across the entire country and the rest of the world. Obviously, the Blackman’s aversion to anything that vaguely resembled the sight, taste, or smell of the White Christian Afrikaner, facilitated the process to stir up the naïve masses and to force 100’s of youths to flee into exile. It is far more exciting to become a terrorist and learn how to fire an AK-47, than to go to school, and when you’re young you don’t care about the long-term consequences!

I even have a deep affection for much of their output. I can also get pretty passionate about which records in the Floyd canon matter.

For example, your cousin Cindy and her husband lost their jobs when the Maytag local factory closed down.

Did you intend these images to be overtly political?

But how different is this from fan fiction? It does the same thing, using characters and settings already provided by the first author and creating new plots. So it's only the quality of the pastiche that is an issue.

As caribou are becoming more abundant (they are migrating back up the Ungava peninsula for the spring), many Inuit have returned to the land to go hunting. This means there will once again be meat in the freezer and nikkuk (dried caribou meat) for sale at the Co-Op. I was inspired to write this post of awesome as I, for the first time since November, munched on the last bag of nikkuk from the Co-Op yesterday. I have been craving caribou all winter but haven’t had the opportunity to eat it as it’s so hard to get (there wasn’t even any meat in the freezer). I was so excited when I found the single remaining ziplock bag of protein-y goodness tossed in with the potato chips, that I didn’t even wait until I left the Co-Op to open it. It was almost gone before I got home (and I even took the skidoo trail shortcut to my house).

Here are some ways to apply the 90/10 principle. If someone says something negative about you, don't be a sponge. Let the attack roll off like water on glass. You don't have to let the negative comment affect you! React properly and it will not ruin your day. A wrong reaction could result in losing a friend, being fired, getting stressed out etc.
Also, the cartridges are very easy to remove and replace - another bonus! I hate struggling to replace cartridges or switch them out when I want to change to a different adhesive type.

At the Franklin Avenue Merchants meeting last night, ILFA had the pleasure of meeting Jacques Belanger and Lev Gewirtzman, the business partners who've taken over the old Franklin Roadhouse space at 688 Franklin (pictured above). The Crown Heights residents have ample experience in the restaurant world between them, and after meeting with CB8 tonight, they're aiming to be open in 5-6 months, offering American casual fare that focuses on seasonal ingredients. No word yet on what the space will look like (as one local designer put it about the Roadhouse, "They really needed an interior decorator") or what it will be called, but with Gueros thriving and the always-popular Bombay Masala just a few doors down, Franklin and Prospect is rapidly becoming a hot culinary corner, and methinks this new spot will be eagerly anticipated (A Slice of Brooklyn does appear to be on the way out, for which ILFA sheds a sentimental tear, but the sale of their lease, signed a few years ago for what's now a prime corner location, should hopefully help the owners get a fresh start somewhere else).

Now anyone worth their salt should already know what the plot of this beauty is, but being the completist that I am, I'll elaborate: In California, an old man (Bela Lugosi) grieves the loss of his wife (Vampira) and on the next day he also dies. However, the space soldier Eros (Dudley Manlove) and second-mate Tanna (Joanna Lee) use an electric device to resurrect them both and the strong Inspector Clay (Tor Johnson) that was murdered by the deceased old man and his wife - though the old man may have been someone else entirely, but anyway.... The aliens' intention is not to conquer Earth but to keep mankind from developing "Solarmonite", a material that would threaten the universe. When the population of Hollywood and Washington DC sees flying saucers wobble in the sky, a colonel (Tom Keene), a police lieutenant (Duke Moore), a commercial pilot (Gregory Walcott), his wife (Mona McKinnon) and some policemen (including Paul Marco as Kelton The Komedy Relief Kop) try to stop the aliens.

Spread thickly over four days, this festival will mix the traditional stands displaying books and equipment with signings and cookery demonstrations from an international selection of chefs. The only thing that leaves a slightly bizarre taste in the mouth is the fact that it will all take place in what was previously the municipal undertakers!

His father died of Alzheimer’s a year later at age 72. On the anniversary of his death, Ruvo and some friends went to Spago, owned by Ruvo’s friend Wolfgang Puck, to celebrate his father’s life. Ruvo’s liquor distributorship, the largest in the country, ships more than 20,000 cases a night, many to the largest casinos in town, making Ruvo a prominent figure in Sin City. Toward the end of the dinner Ruvo’s buddies started pledging money to help find a cure for Alzheimer’s. Ruvo had $35,000 by evening’s end, and he was so inspired that his annual dinner eventually morphed into his star-studded Power of Love event, which by 1996 was raising more than $20 million each year for brain-disease research. Eventually Ruvo had $35 million in his fundraising-charity coffers.

Taliesin, the Welsh hero, who started out as a little boy named Gwion Bach, who ate a potion he shouldn’t have, and, to make a long story short, turned himself into a piece of corn and was eaten by his witch foster mother. She ended up giving birth to him nine months later. At birth, Taliesin speaks like a Rhodes scholar, and so is named Taliesin, or “bright brow,” referring to his intelligence and precocity, something Sagittarians are known for. He also travels the world and has many adventures, as Sagittarians do, all in search of truth. And, the cool part is, he’s based on a real guy! You can read more about him here: http://www.pantheon.org/articles/t/taliesin.html

Therefore I suggest writing up your strategic plan right now and then once a month pulling out that plan and rethink it. What has changed, what was accomplished, what has been sidelined and why, has something new been added to the plate or changed the way business should be handled (e.g., firm growth – new practice group added, new office, moving into a new country). Making periodic changes throughout the year to your strategic plan on a regular basis keeps you more grounded and closer to realizing and shaping the vision as an ongoing effort rather than a onetime exercise. You must set your annual plan, and then judge your progress and adjust your strategy and plan as often as needed.

We said our goodbyes and journeyed home for another 2 hours. JJ and I totally pooped out and slept almost the whole way home until we hit this stuff called traffic by our house. That’s how Mom took this picture. Would you believe all three of us then slept for 5 hours? We woke up at 9:48 p.m., had dinner, Mom cooked for two hours to get ready for work today and walked us around 11:30.
In this description WE ourselves are the idols. We are worshipping our own work and not giving the glory to the Most High. The Lord can use our hands to do his work, but at the end of the day it is his allowance that by which all things happen. You may sow the seed, but it will only produce fruit by the allowance of the Lord. Did you make it rain? Did you make the earth that it grows in? Did you form the sun and cause it to form light? Did you create the plants to grow by ways of the earth, sun, and rain? The truth is you did very little to make this plant grow. God prepared it all in advance, and the work you have to do is minimal in comparison to what has already been done.
I’ve been writing ever since I was a child, just in different genres and with varying degrees of success! When I was small, it was for my own amusement: I made up stories, or created my own versions of Lorna Hill’s Marjorie books – a precedent for my current exploits with Jane Austen, perhaps? Studying languages and literature at school and university meant lots of reading, and writing about reading! Then I went into the business world and learnt how to produce effective reports and presentations. And shadowing my husband’s MBA for a year at Ashridge Business School has certainly provided material for my novels!

Blogging: Most websites have a “blog” segment as part of the website. This site that you’re currently on, for example, is intended to let the blog carry the majority of the weight of the website. That means its primary purpose is as a content providing blog for Alloy Productions. These blog posts can range from posts like these (advisory posts that provide useful information or tools to other business entities) to the basic happenings from within the company (new customers/clients.) The point of a blog is to have a place to put down large portions of information (text, audio or video) so your online audience can consume it. Walmart’s primary website function is different from Alloy Productions, so Walmart doesn’t need to blog to provide content. People will continue pouring into their website to purchase goods. Actually, Walmart.com does actually have a blog section consisting of 5 separate RSS feeds. However, the root word of business is busy, so you may not have time to sit down and blog everyday. That’s OK! This blog is only updated once a week, (unless it’s necessary to update it more often to announce new clients or other news) and that seems to be adequate for our online audience, at this point. Should the audience grow and demand more, then adjustments will be made. You are the keeper of your own audience, so you make the ultimate decision of how often you want to update your website/blog. Blogging is not the only form of audience engagement that exists, however.
They think they’ve got away with it and, you know what?
The American city was once the heart of an industrial machine manned by workers who believed that they could get ahead in life. And then the worker became a minority in cities dominated by the indolent, by municipal unions, by social workers, community organizers and bleeding heart college graduates who squeezed him out. When the looters came for the American worker, he fled to the suburbs, the city declined, and the rioters unleashed their rage on the Chinese who came to take his place.
The boy later explained he had completely given up hope until he saw the teacher. “They wouldn’t send a teacher to work on nouns and adverbs with a dying boy, would they?”
The first is a friend who’s older brother died last year of a sudden heart attack in his early sixties. He lived and died in a different kind of community in the midwest where a lot of people practice a spiritual discipline with deep roots in the Indian Vedic tradition. Naturally, his cremation was attended with some of the chanting and ritual derived from that part of the world. It involved an open casket viewing in a small room within the crematorium following the funeral itself.

Sadly, as very few people are given the necessary tests in the UK to clarify whether they are suffering with neurological ME, the vast majority are given the label ‘CFS’ along with a nod from NICE to withhold further testing and treatment. After being 'labelled' incorrectly, patients are then offered inadequate treatment protocols such as a) antidepressants (only a small proportion of sufferers become depressed and this is usually in response to continued suffering from loss of health, loss of career with subsequent loss of income, loss of education, loss of home, loss of support, and continued ignorance from government officials, doctors, media and the public in general), b) pain killers and C) talk and graded exercise therapy (which can cause serious health repercussions to those patients with compromised hearts and circulatory systems (approximately 1/3 of sufferers)). Many patients are seriously ill and yet they are denied necessary testing and treatment. Consider what happens to a cancer or AIDS sufferer if left untreated? Would you suppose it ethical to deny them treatment? ME sufferers DO die from the condition, at least they die from complications arising from the condition (as is the case with AIDS). A diagnosis of CFS will always be a misdiagnosis and a diagnosis that results in the cessation of necessary testing and withholding of vital treatment. This is deeply unethical.
The essence of these lessons to me as a child was that I was not the center of the universe. And, parenting styles change over the years and we’ve moved towards a more child-centered approach. I am not knocking this, as I am not a parent and in my classes I advocate a student-centered approach. As I see it, a child’s natural behavior is to do things like interrupt, need attention at inopportune times and take up all the energy of the adults around them. I get it. I want all the attention too. But what I know, and what many of my parent friends have discovered, is that behaving as if the child’s needs are the only needs in the room does little to support self-initiative or responsibility. These skills are important if we are to succeed in our endeavors—both personal and worldly.

Whilst on the Catering course I got a job as an Office Manager for an IT company.

No, really. My five-year-old loves to sing, try her hand at instruments, and–as a leftie–she’s truly one of those people with an ear for plunking out a tune.
I have always been slightly dubious of personality tests. They can never fully describe someone’s personality type – we are all unique. However, they can definitely highlight some natural strengths. And being a confident and authentic leader is about playing to your strengths – rather than trying to become someone you are not; someone you would like to be.
Nonetheless I did enjoy seeing Agron and McHale play off each other (secretly I am a Quartie shipper) and hope to see more development on that front throughout the rest of the season. Despite the circumstances Artie’s found himself a friend who finally realizes what its like to be on his level (literally) and he could be a good source of comfort and support for Quinn in the weeks ahead.

I really, really, really wish I had a round pen...one with a good sand base...My neighbors have a really nice round pen, and they graciously let me use it whenever I need it, but the base of their pen is not "frantic horse" friendly for some reason...and I'm afraid the ponies are going to slip, get hurt, or break the round pen wall. So I use that pen when I'm doing in-hand work that will (hopefully) not result in galloping/bucking. (Sigh.) There's always something else needed when it comes to horse ownership. An arena would be nice too. haha ~I could go on.

Sigh. Nothing new in all this. Fifteen too many drinks, out of control egos, logic circuits burned out by the desire to get laid - this isn't going to be pretty. Of course when I lob at the front of the club, only a handful of these wankers is there. My backup plan is a parking lot I know of just around the corner, so I head there. It's one way in and out and only as wide a table-tennis table, so it requires a twenty point turn to get pointed the right way, but eventually we're settled, ready to head out.
Arsenal, in it to win it, marches forward and one of them fires a long, high ball. Groans emerge from the sidelines, sure the Keeper can’t get a hand to it. Alexa calmly deflects to her feet then collects it and sends it on.

Another thing that has surprised me about the election results, both European and local is the lack of imagination the electorate has shown in their response to the ‘collapse of trust’ that the expenses farrago has supposedly triggered.

Some of the city’s old favorites are back. The brief, for instance, feigns ignorance at Mike Nifong’s former title (which was, since the city's multi-million dollar attorneys appear to be unaware of it, District Attorney of Durham County). Instead, the city’s attorneys repeatedly term him “State Prosecutor” Nifong, as if his office instead was under the supervision of AG Roy Cooper. Durham’s lawyers also ignore Nifong’s role in supervising the police investigation. The brief also repeats the conventional Durham argument about the grand jury indictment all but requiring that the civil suit against the city be thrown out, regardless of the myriad instances of misconduct committed by DPD officers that had nothing to do with two officers' grand jury testimony.

I was thinking of the Marvel Universe earlier last year when I was reading through the works of Howard Philips Lovecraft? Why, because there is a sense that I feel that Lovecraft had an earlier notion of a grand narrative unifying many stories through the same universe in the same way that the Marvel comic universes do. There is something almost operatic about creating imaginary worlds and entertaining creative space within them. For too long people have undermined or scoffed at these media forms as either lowbrow or base or childish, the same is said for computer games as an artform; comics and the graphic novel as a literary form.

The matter wasn't exactly resolved in the meeting (not that it could be, but nonetheless), and it left me thinking about the issue as I went home to the lady, with whom I had this exchange:

Well...19 of my 24 came through in a fluster of activity and conversations. Not too bad. I had a nice time chatting with parents and meeting my new little ones...I just wish it wasn't such an overwhelming hour...it's so hard to remember who was who afterwards! But, I feel so good about this year already...parent support is going to be up from last year...and the kinders were all so sweet today. It makes me wish we were starting school tomorrow (did I just say that???)...in all reality of course I will be putting the thousand finishing touches on the room from tomorrow until school starts next Wednesday!
When it comes to making costumes, the easier, the better. Especially when the kids are too young to really understand why they are dressing up. I bought Lily the 'Best Friend Bear' Care Bear at the flea market for $.50, and she fell in love with it! It is the first stuffed animal that she has grown attached to. Don't you dare give it a hug! That's her bear and she knows it! It's hilarious. I thought it would be so cute to dress her up like her beloved bear.
For these reasons – and for the reasons I’ll add every Sunday that I go to church and am freshly inspired (or spiritually challenged), I’m making this my weekly tithe. And if you can find a church you love even half as much as I love Lourdes, you’ll feel blessed to support it, too. I promise.
As I said, I will have some more to share soon and I'll also share a photo of a gorgeous little coaster wall hanging that Erica made me while we were crafting on Sunday!

Compared to Chobani, it looked very similar but the strawberry preparation was redder and less purple-y at first even though there was less visible fruit. The yogurt also looked more solid instead of creamy with the separation. After it was mixed, its red tinge wasn’t quite as bright or colourful as the Chobani cup. At least it was reddish instead of purple.

Uncle Sam has a perverse habit of taxing cash as it comes into the United States. So you will understand the reticence of some executives to repatriate profits. Democrats want and need to tax. Will politicians help hurt Apple.
The release is right about some things. The number of Black-owned companies jumped 60.5 percent between 2002 and 2007. And revenues and employment at Black-owned employer firms grew faster than similar numbers at White-owned companies.
Many of you have planted pink flowers to honor our little angel friend, Payton. I had specifically asked for pink flowers when dad left for the (plant) nursery. When mom came back from the (kids) nursery, she saw what dad had planted.
We apologise for a lack of reviews on this site lately, about three weeks ago our beloved computer finally gave up the ghost meaning we had no practical way of updating this blog. Due to financial issues we haven't replaced it yet but a new one is on the cards for late October when we hope to fully resume our reviewing activities.
Now, I’m not saying every single thing I read or write should end sadly – far from it - but I am suggesting that, if this is a stipulation of the genre, we ought to bend it a bit, if not break it outright. Not every tale of our future selves ends well; we should be courageous and willing enough to explore that.

Never mind. With the rate at which this murderous trend is growing, we’ll all be swept up in this craze by the end of the year. Going out killing is the new staying in!

It wasn’t the first time I’d made my own bread, but I had never made anything good enough to inspire me to make more. That particular loaf wasn’t much better than those that preceded it: too dense, not seasoned enough, and, well, just “too homemade”, as my husband Marc likes to say “tactfully.”
Our happy little fur baby family existed peacefully for a few years. On cold nights, when my beloved would go out and check on them, they would all be snuggled up in their room in the back of the garage, with their warming lamp and each other to stay warm. The dogs would arouse to greet him when he walked in. Always at the bottom of the pile would lay Sterling, annoyed that someone had interrupted his evening’s repose.
We hosted a party last weekend. A sort of housewarming, kick off to the new semester, Fete de la Revolution (it was after all the one year anniversary of the Tunisian revolution), and well, why not have a party.

SUMMIT LEAGUE: You’re 17-1 in league play and one of the best mid-majors in the nation. How are you rewarded – by playing the conference tournament on the homecourt of the second place team in the conference. That’s what Oral Roberts’ dilemma is as it prepares for the conference tournament hosted by South Dakota St. That South Dakota St team is responsible for Oral Roberts lone conference loss. On March 6, it’ll be responsible for Oral Roberts’ second conference loss.
While being consistently brutal during the whole album, this music suffers from a lack of variation when listening to the five last songs. This thrash exercise could have been more efficient and less tedious on a 7inch format, but still, its a good release for the japanese hardcore enthusiasts out there.

Rosalind Wiseman, author of Queen Bees and Wannabes stated something that was easy to resonate with. “Conflict will happen and abuse of any power is inevitable. However, with bullies, they believe they are in the right because the person they are trying to overpower may be of a different race, religion or have any differences from what they believe to be right.” As a survivor, I saw much of this growing up and other survivors I know can vouch for this. We were different in some way and the abuser did not like it. This is also a pattern seen in adults who abuse children, spouses and even peers in the workplace. The question was asked as to why bullies do what they do in the first place? Its simple; they are learning poor social skills, bad role modeling in parents and may I add that for the most part, someone is hurting them somewhere else and they bring their own feelings and put them upon others.

Obama said he had been swayed in particular by considering the service of gays and lesbians in the US military. “At a certain point I just concluded, for me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married,” Obama said.

The ruling ends several years of legal wrangling that began after the 2004 elections, when the PDC and PCN failed to earn the minimum number of votes needed to legally maintain their party status. The legislature intervened in 2005 to keep the two parties alive. But this past June, the Tribunal Supremo Electoral (TSE) revisited the issue and officially “canceled” the PDC and PCN.
If you can’t think of something to say immediately, but eventually think of the perfect thing, say it then. It is never too late. Grief lasts a very long time. As the days, weeks, months pass, others forget, but the person who is grieving doesn’t. Any indication that you are thinking of her in her sorrow is comforting.
Notes: Technically the “Communism!” part is spoken by Lisa’s classmates, but it’s pretty hard to get an elementary school class into a sports bar. You should still try, though.
Although an active wharf, Fisherman’s Wharf is a big tourist attraction. It has shops, restaurants, crowds of people, shitty street performers, a wax museum, and other useless pursuits. What this has to do with Italian crab fishermen during the gold rush is beyond me. For clam chowder, we went to Boudin Bakery, one of the first makers of sourdough bread and now a huge chain and a tourist attraction in itself. The lines were long, and the pop music off-putting, but it moved fast and before long we were chowing down on clam chowder in bread bowls. For those of you who haven’t experienced this, first imagine a loaf of tangy sourdough bread. And now imagine someone took out the middle and filled it with piping hot, creamy clam chowder. It’s simply the best way to have it. As you eat the soup, you can scrape the sides of the bowl and get soft mushy bits of sourdough in with your soup. I have to stop, I’m making myself hungry!

On Novice A we scored a 71.73%. Uh...that's a 28.2 in eventing language. AKA lowest score we've ever gotten. Novice A is what we are riding at Las Cruces next month too. Once again...holy crap. Klein just keeps improving her dressage scores. On Novice B we scored a 68% aka a 32 in eventing language. On Training 1 we scored a 65%, not bad for hoping I didn't get lost some where 'cause of all the letters and riding the test once before that.

THE LADY'S MASQUERADE
Well, though I enjoyed to make it... after several rounds... I had to admit that this is not good for my neck, though it is scarf, but it is not comfortable to wear it around my neck... maybe the pattern is too thick, maybe the yarn is not proper (acrylic), maybe it is too wide, I dunno which is the main cause, but I became sad when I experienced this discomfort around my neck... so now it is hanging on side wall of a wardrobe... it has a proper place :)) it warms the wardrobe... :D .. My plan is to decorate it with crocheted flowers... which I would like to try out how to make, so this place will be a very good place to put them after I have made them...

Santa, it seems, knows how superficial I can be and does not judge me for it. Right after I unwrapped my rather austere looking Kindle on Christmas morning, I also unwrapped a pretty hot pink leather cover to dress it up in. Cute, right? And it'll stop the Kindle itself getting all scratched up in the murky depths of my handbag, which is a major win.

Did it ever strike you what a wonderful thing it is for the Lord to give a new heart and a right spirit to a man? You have seen a lobster, perhaps, which has fought with another lobster, and lost one of its claws, and a new claw has grown. That is a remarkable thing; but it is a much more astounding fact that a man should have a new heart given to him. This, indeed, is a miracle beyond the powers of nature. There is a tree. If you cut off one of its limbs, another one may grow in its place; but can you change the tree; can you sweeten sour sap; can you make the thorn bear figs? You can graft something better into it and that is the analogy which nature gives us of the work of grace; but absolutely to change the vital sap of the tree would be a miracle indeed. Such a prodigy and mystery of power God works in all who believe in Jesus.
1) A clean computer. Most of my writing is done on a white MacBook, which gets dirty easily and often. If there’s even one small smudge of dirt, I’m so consumed by the need to clean it I can’t write a thing. Before heading out to my favorite coffee shop, I always check to make sure its clean. Awesome tip: I’ve found Mr. Clean Magic Eraser is the best product to clean a matte finish Mac. It zaps every stain and makes my Mac look brand new.
My pal Emily is an Annie fan. Remember Annie? Yeah, Ben's childhood sweetheart with the weird wooden dolls. She's adorable and Ben likes her so WE should like her. Anyways, I forget how we got on the subject (like I could ever rationalize what makes me draw the ridiculous crap that I do) but the idea crossed our minds that I draw young Ben sandwiched between Annie and Emily's younger self. Because young Ben is adorable and awkward.
Get excited for the 2013 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter: the award-winning vans are undergoing several developments, including all-new technological developments, specifically the 7G Tronic automatic gearbox which reportedly can still operate very well even in temperature as low as -22 degrees Fahrenheit. It also has the new Electronic Stability Program, which works as Brake Disk Wipe and Electronic Brake Prefil. Other new features are the ECO steering system, engine start/stop system and resistance tires – all part of the BlueEFFICIENCY pack.
Having moved here during the flood event of last year, river swimming was the last thing on our minds. Lately, though, when it's been hot and we couldn't be bothered with the hassles of finding parking near the beach, or didn't have time to drive all the way to Bribie Island where we could take the 4WD onto the sand, we've turned our thoughts to river swimming.
You throw a small coin into the wooden box through the slats on top and then take a stick of incense from the side. At some temples, they don't rely on the honour system though. You have to pay a set price (usually 100 yen -- about $1) to an attendant who then hands over a little bundle of incense.

Creed Taylor brought David Matthews, who is now often confused with another popular musician of the same name, to CTI in 1975. There, he crafted a notable body of work that probably reflects the era's musical flavors (disco, etc.) more than the work his predecessors provided for the label.
In black malts roasted dry in this manner the husk is strongly overheated, which causes a profound modification of the husks. These black malts thus often acquire a burnt or empyreumatic odour and taste. To avoid these faults it is considered expedient to prepare black malt not from dry but from moistened malt. Instead of moistening malt it is just as good to use half finished kiln malt. In fact, black malts prepared from malts with a higher moisture content show a more uniform browning of the mealy body. The taste also remains milder, the husks being modified to a less degree and hence less quantity of bitter substances formed."
Probably the single greatest thing he did for us (aside from earning a living and being a nice man) was to build a cabin about an hour from where we lived. He designed it; he and Mom built it. Our family spent weekends and Augusts (his vacation month) there for more than 30 years. It's where we had our best times as a family, where we built the memories that flood the mind with sunshine, the smell of jackpine and blueberries, the tug of a crappie on the line as the waves lap and someone says, "Grab the net." We thought we had a 99-year lease on the land, but the state changed the law and we lost it. By then Mom was dead, Dad had remarried, we all took on other obligations, and opportunities to get together as a family greatly diminished.
And just a side note, my ipod was playing today ( I switch between my ipod and pandora ) and all of a sudden I heard songs I forgot I even had. I mean the thing is on shuffle, but it's very particular about what it shuffles and every once in awhile it will go way back to a hundred or so songs that hardly ever see the light of day. Just something that happens - sigh.
She was staring into the face of a longhaired, bearded man, but she could have sworn she had noticed no rider as the horse dived through the trees. With a queer thought she looked down, and her mouth, if possible, dropped even lower. There was a point where the bare-chested man, who held Alice carefully in his arms, ceased, and the horse that had gallantly attacked the monster, began. He was both horse and man, and a superb specimen of both. He was broad and wild, with piercing blue eyes and a long, silky mane of blond hair.

It was not even a revelation from Jesus Christ, but you will see in Galatians 1:12 that it was of Jesus Christ. This complies with Galatians 1:16 as God called Paul’s grace “to reveal his son in me.” That was much more than Peter or any of the Apostles before him could preach. They preached about Christ but Paul preached Christ, as we all should be as we live under grace.
Karl was demure around CB that night after having held CB’s hand the previous time. Karl further explained to CB that he, Karl, only held CB’s hand so Karl can figure out some things for himself including how he feels (or not feels) for Bimby.
