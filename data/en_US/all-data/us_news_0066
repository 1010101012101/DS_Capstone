The news continued to be good regarding Brandon Roy, who reported no ill effects from playing 41 minutes in Friday’s victory over Phoenix. After the game, which was the second in a back-to-back for the Blazers, Roy revealed that he told athletic trainer Jay Jensen he no longer felt his left knee needed to have a 35-minute restriction in playing time.
“I can see the ball moving, and it’s all over the place,” said Justin Turner, who entered the game after Ruben Tejada left with a right quad strain. “That thing was nasty today. I’m glad I get to play behind him and don’t have to go up there and hit against him.”
Those who have experienced hunting on the Schickerling's ranch prefer it to hunting in the United States because the ratio of animals to hunters can be tenfold, even hundredfold.
Talk to people in the city's most beleaguered neighborhoods -- the ones with prairie-like gaps up and down the blocks -- and what you'll hear is a pining for the kind of cohesiveness and support that existed when there were more people and houses, more eyes and ears.
Well, if you're a saver in America, you should know how that football feels. You've been passed and carried around the turf without any power to change the outcome of the game. The current fight over the future of money-market mutual funds is just the latest play.
With a progressive tax system -- supposedly requiring the rich to pay more of their income than the poor -- it's indefensible that some wealthy people enjoy preferential treatment. It subverts any sense of fairness. And raising the top rate wouldn't much hurt the economy if the rate isn't punitive. To me, 30 percent seems reasonable. It's lower than today's top rate, 35 percent; and it roughly equals the top rate on capital gains (mainly profits from stock sales) in the late 1980s. That was 28 percent; the economy did fine.
Conditions were calm in the first half but the rain and wind picked up after the break. Because of the rescheduled time only 500 people attended the match at the 18,000-seat Fukuda Denshi Arena.

The shape of the public debate over rebuilding is turning out to be much broader than restoring broken roads and compensating victims in Japan's stricken northeast. It's encompassing a wide range of national policies, such as immigration and the country's electricity use, that probably will determine the growth path for decades to come.
Let's give Cameron some credit though. Maybe it was ingenuity, or maybe it was desperation, but either way, his decision to put Flacco in the shotgun and make him hustle the offense to the line of scrimmage changed everything about this game. It slowed Arizona's pass rush, it gave Flacco a boost of confidence, and raised the energy level of the entire offense.
Green, 66, has some views that would set him apart from most Republicans in Congress. The Northeast Portland resident said the the key to restoring the economy is to erect trade barriers that he said would keep more jobs in the U.S.

Growing up in Connecticut, our family dinners revolved around thick grilled steaks, roasted chickens, the occasional boiled lobster. And I was bored almost beyond eating. It was the late 1960s: New flavors and foods were rushing onto the nation's table with the same vigor as the new fashions and the new politics. Given this was the age both of Aquarius and the picket sign, I raised my voice loudly in protest.
Presently, no specific size has been set for the structure, but groups responding to the RFP would need to inspect the location to make any determination. They would also need to consider the nearby parking lot and water source.

After more than 12 years as a trial court and court of appeals judge, and more years than that being tangentially involved with judicial issues as an attorney, I firmly believe that all seven justices on our state Supreme Court -- including those up for election this year, Justices Stephen Markman and Brian Zahra -- are experienced, principled individuals with stellar reputations. Although they may disagree on many important cases, those disagreements result from differing legal views, not from who is before the court.

The question is hardly isolated to PacifiCorp. Utilities across the country have already canceled plans to build more than 150 new coal plants in the past four years, according to the shareholder activist group As You Sow. A 2010 study by The Brattle Group, a Boston-based consulting outfit, found that 20 percent of the coal generation capacity in the nation could be retired if currently contemplated mandates are passed. The study estimated that compliance costs for plants that stay open could total $180 billion.

Dear K.A.: Hang your leather pants in a cool closet, but do not cover them with a plastic bag, as leather must breathe or it will become dry and brittle. Try to avoid having your pants dry-cleaned as long as possible, and then take them only to a leather specialist. The solvents used in regular dry cleaning will cause the leather to stiffen and lose its luster. For surface soil, smooth leather can be wiped with a damp cloth. For a list of dry cleaners specializing in leather, go to leatherusa.com, the website for Leather Industries of America.

2009 Von Schubert Maximin Grunhauser Abtsberg Mosel Riesling Spatlese ($39): There are plenty of Rieslings to try young, but the von Schubert lineup typically rewards aging. This has a good 20 years or more in it; it brims with dense nectar-y fruit and a laser-like mineral power.

Yet director and editor P. David Ebersol seems uncertain throughout of what tale he is telling, whether to focus on Schemel specifically or the larger picture of the band and the moments in contemporary rock history they were all witness to. Often the film pushes Schemel to the edge of what is intended to be her story, so in "Hit So Hard" she feels forced into the role of self-sacrificing side-player once again.
The Michigan Court of Appeals dismissed a challenge Friday of new redistricting maps for the Oakland County Board of Commissioners.
With only about 2,500 full-time U.S. homeopaths, patients routinely diagnose themselves. Dr. Ahmed Currim, one of 13 state-licensed homeopathic doctors in Connecticut, discourages people from buying homeopathic remedies without professional advice, because they "don't know what they're doing."
"They've been doing a lot of the same things for a long time," Helfrich said. "They're just tweaking it. It's kind of that next level of, hey, we do this really well, let's make this adjustment. The consistency of being together and having a lot of talent is adding up."

"It is astonishing that this report -- which provides no empirical data or quantitative analysis -- does not recognize Jersey City as a model for the judicious use of tax abatements which have dramatically increased property values, led to the creation of thousands of units of affordable housing and thousands of construction and permanent jobs, as well as increased investment and funds into our city coffers," he said in a statement.
As mentioned, creation isn't an issue. The Blues are developing plenty of scoring chances to tip games to their side. Over the past five starts, a 4-0-1 stretch, the Blues have 177 shots on goal to

Dixon Doll, founder of Doll Capital Management, said his "back of the envelope" estimate is that valley venture capitalists may have stakes in as many as 100 companies strong enough to consider IPOs.

Sixteen states, including California, Colorado, Texas and New York, have passed legislation enabling these types of program. The next step is for individual counties or municipalities to begin issuing bonds. The concept requires that cities have the ability to form a "special tax district" or "assessment district" to finance energy improvements; some municipalities already have the authority, but many require enabling legislation.
Wafels & Dinges, a pioneer of the New York City truck food scene, opened its first store on the Seaside boardwalk last month. If you go expecting crunchy IHOP waffles, you’ll be disappointed. The waffles at W&D are soft, chewy and mildly sweet. The Munchers didn’t seem wowed by the waffles — Mark Jay called them “overpriced and overhyped” — but the Belgian Madness, with Hoegaarden White Ale and honey, is an unexpected delight.

Bobbi Johnson, Shriner and other former appointees described constituent services as the special forces of Ficano's army of appointees.

World Peace's two sides are difficult to reconcile, even for the player himself. He grew up around violence and gang activity in Queensbridge projects of Queens, New York, but excelled in college before becoming an NBA All-Star and the league's top defensive player in 2004. He has acknowledged drinking during games early in his career, and he rewarded the Pacers for their patience with his 2004-05 suspension by demanding a trade shortly after he returned.
We came up short, but I dont think we lost. I think they just beat us, Self said. Davis realized early this was no shoot-first night for him at the Superdome. Sporting his near-unibrow, which the UK Wildcat mascot also decided to paste on, he endured the worst shooting night of a short college career in which he makes 64 percent. No big deal. He set the tone early on defense, swatting Robinsons shot twice, grabbing rebounds, making pretty bounce passes for assists.

Weak Chicago-area manufacturing data released Monday increased the odds that the Federal Reserve will embark on a new round of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing, in order to stimulate the economy, traders and analysts said.

In an attempt to grade success, The Plain Dealer matched draft lists with a decade of AP All-Pro teams from 2002 to 2011. That's a high bar to set -- finding an All-Pro -- but what NFL general manager wouldn't be thrilled with that outcome? Special teams players were excluded because most were undrafted free agents.

Veysey, who runs a video production company in Cleveland, often talked over both of his opponents. When the three candidates were asked about abortion, Veysey, who supports women's reproductive rights, interjected as Kaptur and Kucinich shared their views. Kaptur opposes federal funding for abortions; Kucinich had opposed abortion rights but flip-flopped before running for president in 2004. Veysey noted these nuances.

Lars and Bianca in "Lars and the Real Girl" (2007): Ryan Gosling had a breakout year in 2011, but that's just when more people discovered him; he's always been good. This film is proof: He plays Lars, a shy man who announces to his brother and sister-in-law that he has a new friend named Bianca -- who is, in fact, an inflatable sex doll.

Our era's "remix" culture is a vast exercise in intellectual-property modding, one that includes everything from sampling to YouTube video parodies, from software "mash-ups" to customized action figures for sale on eBay and the intricate web of blogs.

DeCourcy: After getting the chance for my first in-person look at No. 8 Marquette, I continue to love the Golden Eagles’ spirit and toughness. They have two elite players in forward Jae Crowder and guard Darius Johnson-Odom, and they’re as hard to defend man-to-man as anyone this side of Missouri.

But after “Appetite,” the band began to fray. “G N' R Lies” was a rushed semi-acoustic set marred by several songs with willfully offensive lyrics; “Use Your Illusion I & II” was a massive two-disc project (parts sold separately -- some assembly required) that found the band pushing in a hundred directions at once. After a covers album, the big Guns went silent for years. Finally in 2008, Rose released “Chinese Democracy” under the Guns N’ Roses name to mixed reviews.

Role: Miller's Blazers tenure got off to a rocky start, but by the end of last season Miller had endeared himself to teammates and fans with his no-nonsense approach and rugged game. He arguably was the team's MVP last season and will be counted on to provide veteran savvy, floor leadership and scoring as the starting point guard in 2010-11. Concerns remain about his on-court chemistry with Brandon Roy, but when the duo is clicking, they form a dynamic backcourt.

Defensively, everywhere the Blazers took the ball they found another layer of defense to overcome – usually unsuccessfully. When Portland found a brief crack in the Lakers’ interior defense, it quickly closed with multiple players there to dig at the ball and contest the shot when it did go up. When the ball went back out to the perimeter the Lakers swarmed even harder by trapping the ball when possible or just pressuring the ball handler into a difficult position when it wasn’t. It started with Ron Artest’s smothering defense on Brandon Roy who was locked down by Artest from the opening tip. Wherever Roy went he found Ron clamped onto him in a position to contest his every move.

The story seems the same no matter where you live or where you're from. The two of us, for instance, come from very different backgrounds: One of us is a fourth-generation New Yorker living in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn; the other was born in Guyana and lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn.

Hey, Tony: Read your article about kickers becoming "too good." I'd like to get your opinion on the following rule change which would take effect when I become king: On kickoffs, if the ball is kicked out-of-bounds on the fly, penalty places the ball on the 40, as presently. If it bounces or rolls out-of-bounds before getting to the end zone, the receiving team takes possession at that yard line, just like a punt. I think the change would add an interesting element to the game, requiring more precision than distance kicking, and may cause receiving teams to use two returners to cover the field, reducing the number of blockers by one, or risk bad field position. BTW, I happen to enjoy watching teams (not QB'd by Elway) try to succeed in 90-yard drives. -- Seren Hrachian, Athens, N.Y.

Of course, the great hope is that all this tracking will lead to the animals themselves, which is why it was such a pleasure -- albeit a macabre one -- for the students to come upon the raw scene laid out by a cougar, a bobcat and a deer.

"Lockout" marks their feature film writing/directing debut, and for all of its rough edges and dead-ends, there are still flashes of that indefinable quality — promise? talent? — that makes you hope they get other chances to try for more top-to-bottom polish and panache.
Craving a hot dog? Forget about the ones served inside the Rock and pay a visit to this orange-and-black lunch truck on the Rutgers-Newark campus. Sharon, the owner, and her son — he’s Bubba — also run a hot dog stand on the Seaside Heights boardwalk in the summer. The truck is open 8 a.m. - 7 p.m. Monday through Friday.

"Honestly, when it didn't happen I think there are reasons that I can't go into right now, but there is a very close relationship between the people getting the deal done and the people who offered," Holmgren was quoted as saying by multiple Cleveland-area media outlets. "And I'm not sure anything we offered would have been good enough. We were very, very aggressive and it didn't work."

Every spring since the 1930s, it has become a tradition for a thousand or more skiers to hike up the precipitous bowl, then barrel down the hair-raising, near-vertical headwall, a ritual I have easily managed to avoid, despite Moe's nagging.
3. Columbus Crew: Chilean addition Milovan Mirosevic misses PK in Toronto but Crew finds a way to win again.
Abdul-Jabbar was 26 when his third MVP season — out of a record six — ended. James is 27. Riley, the former Los Angeles Lakers coach during the Showtime era, has an affinity for both.

And as a result, St. Louis Public Schools could be forced to spend $175 million on tuition costs and about $134 million for transportation and special education services, according to Don Senti, executive director of Cooperating School Districts of Greater St. Louis. The result, which would exceed last year's operating budget of about $275 million for the city district, would bankrupt the district, leaving students with few resources and the district with little chance to regain accreditation, he said.
Louis C. Satterfield and his wife, Emilia, paid cash for a six-bedroom, nine-bath, 8,202-square-foot Tuscan estate at Bret Hills in Paradise Valley. The spacious floor plan includes a formal living room, dining room, a grand kitchen open to the family room and eating area and a theater room.

necessarily translate to the postseason. The Knicks have Stoudemire back, so Anthony will spend more time being defended by LeBron James rather than Chris Bosh, whereas the two split responsibilities on Melo in the final regular season matchup.
The appearance by the Cardinals is further proof that it is not just a cliché that professional sports teams form a bond with one another and support each other to the fullest.

LONDON (Reuters) - European shares joined in a worldwide rally on Wednesday after strong U.S. factory activity data and a pickup in Asia raised hopes of a global economic recovery, but fears over the health of the euro zone kept the single currency under pressure.
"What we know is that 3,000 Americans die every year from preventable food-borne illnesses that are not linked" to mad cow disease, said Sarah Klein of the consumer advocacy group Center for Science in the Public Interest. "Things like E. coli, salmonella — that's where we should be focusing our attention, outrage and policy."
This wine was also very good and was somewhat similar in style to the Saint-Bris. It was a tad lighter in body and complexity yet higher in alcohol, at 13.5 percent. This is also a fresh, crisp wine with tangy citrus flavors, herbs and minerality. The Los Vascos also would be good with seafood.
It was this food that Glen Bell, World War II Marine Corps veteran and owner of Bell's Drive-in hot-dog stand, ate and loved and riffed on until, in San Bernardino, Redlands and Riverside, he established three stands featuring Mexican food, Taco Tia, a concept that he eventually transformed into the mega-chain all America knows for its "Run for the Border" ad slogan and "Yo quiero Taco Bell" Chihuahua dog, not to mention those famed crackly tacos.

He still marvels that for all these years she alone has manned the open counter, with only faded newspaper clippings about the Lakers standing between her and potential miscreants.
To find the best deal possible in this market you first need to figure out what makes one rental cheaper than others in a given area. For instance, space in new apartment buildings is at a premium since relatively few buildings have been built since the housing crisis. That means the best deals can be found in older constructions, though even these are pricier these days.
Economists expect the January employment report to show that
The catch? It won't be displayed at your movie theater's snack bar. Nope. Food sold at the multiplex isn't covered in this part of the bill. Doesn't seem to make sense, as a calorie is a calorie, no matter where you eat it. (We sense political pressure at work, but that's another column.) Meanwhile, here's the lowdown on the scariest thing playing at movie theaters: The menu.
Other factors can apply, so there are no guarantees that this would help your score.
Things to bring with you: Small bills, a framed photo of your significant other (to place on the hotel bedside table as a reminder not to go into strip club VIP rooms) and linen pants.

Award of Excellence: Luna Restaurant, 429 Main St., Three Bridges; (908) 284-2321. Luna, tucked into a white house in this small village, did all three pizzas well. Pizza Patrol member Scott Wiener loved the plain’s "perfect blend of crispy exterior and tender interior.’’ But the sausage pizza is the standout.
Tebow prayed for the Lord to help him determine where to play, but in his mind and heart, the answer remained elusive. Thirty minutes before Tebow's news conference, he was still conflicted. Finally, he went to his dad, who asked, "Who's the one person you want to play for?"
Sitcom's locally designed furniture collections will seem familiar to anyone who's spent time shopping for modern furniture styles. Furniture and accessories sold at the outlet are often marked as one-of-a-kind floor models, or they may be discontinued collections or pieces. Cabinetry, tables, media centers and bookcases are often sold in boxes for assembly. At its upcoming sale, overstock, discontinued and slightly damaged designer furniture and accessories will be marked down further. In the same warehouse, Hebi Arts, wholesaler of innovative, contemporary home accessories will be selling discontinued and sample inventory at 50 to 70 percent markdowns from retail.

Officer Tanya Tamm will receive the Melissa Schmidt Community Service Award for her work on the Wills for Heroes program. Tamm set up 10 clinics for more than 500 first responders in St. Paul, Duluth and other outstate agencies.
It's bigger than the KitchenAid model and takes up more counter space, but the fact that it has an attachment for a blender ($49.95 at Sur La Table) and small food processor ($59.95 at Sur La Table) seemed like a plus - three pieces of equipment in one (though the attachments need to be purchased separately).
Students who drop out before completing high school will have a harder time finding and keeping a job, and they will earn less money when they do. They will be more likely to spend time in prison, will be sicker and will die sooner than those with diplomas. And they will cost local, state and federal governments billions in increased social service costs. There was a time when it was possible to live a productive, middle class life without graduating from high school, but in the 21st Century, not even that will be sufficient. That's why it was so important for the Maryland General Assembly to pass legislation this year that will gradually increase the state's dropout age to 18. We cannot force students to take their studies seriously or complete their graduation requirements, but we can eliminate any vestiges of cultural norms that implied that dropping out was an acceptable decision.
Jackie Palmer, Atholton
Nature lovers flock to St. John, which, at 28 square miles, is the smallest of the three inhabited isles. Two-thirds of St. John is a U.S. national park, and the rest is minimally developed.
It is evident that she has not let that lost period in her life define her, but explained it helped her grow, learn and become able help others.
Twain was a walking contradiction, a grade-school dropout from Hannibal with a deep knowledge of history and human nature. After stints as a printer and a riverboat pilot, he fled bloody Civil War Missouri and headed for Nevada, where he failed miserably at prospecting for silver, as he was to fail miserably at many business ventures in his life.
I was a volunteer at the Centre for Animal Rehabilitation and Education (www.primatecare.org.za) in South Africa, on a private game reserve that shares fenceless borders with Kruger National Park. The closest town is about 45 minutes away.

During the hearing, Miller, 43, faced relatives of the dead, who had come to America from India for the hearing, and read a statement that said, in part, "There are not enough sorries I could ever say..."
Here's how it works: Borrowers turn over a postdated check for $300 and get $255 in return, to be repaid in two weeks. Few can pay off the loan on time, so they take out additional loans, paying $45 each time, all for the same $255 -- the equivalent of a 460 percent annual rate. It's so damaging that Congress has barred these lenders from doing business with members of the military, fearing that it could affect the troops' readiness.
"We didn't start paying for the (ratings) service, which is normally how you get a bump," KFNS President Dave Greene said. "So it must be because we are sticking to what works best." He said that formula is "first and foremost (to be) entertaining while also being informative and compelling."
A lot has happened since that display of political theater at the 2008 convention in Denver.

June is an especially endearing place to sit with a cocktail and nibble your way through sausage-stuffed cabbage or smoked tuna belly in bagna cauda, and there is a polished, often highly occupied bar open for such activity. The dining area is austerely comfortable, stark wooden tables peering into an open kitchen. It's very much Portland, 2010: natural local ingredients, natural local space.
"If a country becomes more productive and competitive, but there is no demand for its products domestically or around it, growth will not materialize," Italy's Mr. Monti said in a speech in Brussels last week.
There's lots of other history to be learned in Ybor City beyond tales of the underworld, as fascinating as they are.

As for the cellos, they welcomed him like family. This was also the environment in which he met his future wife, Joela Jones, who was already serving as the orchestra's principal keyboard player.
"I loved the Coach & Horses and so did Sean. I had a drink in here when I was in high school," says Meisler. "I love the neighborhood and I love the history."
"So this kind of backhanded way of saying they care about cities and local governments, meanwhile robbing them blind," Turner said. "If this is what the Republican Party calls looking out for local government, they are a dollar short and a day late. It is absolutely shameful."
"It was just a great day for the pro-life movement in Ohio," said Michael Gonidakis, executive director of Ohio Right to Life, which supported two of the three bills passed Tuesday.
Young is a great shooter but his defense is questionable.
A narrow plurality of voters, 39 percent, singled out Republicans in Congress for blame for inaction in Washington while 31 percent said the administration and congressional Republicans and Democrats were all to blame.
The new Congress appears unlikely to approve more spending to try to invigorate the economy and the job market. And the Federal Reserve is running out of options.
Three bishops have already tendered their resignations after a government-authorized investigation published in November found that Dublin Archdiocese authorities habitually concealed evidence of pedophile priests from civil authorities for decades.
The Lions have had three players, all 2011 draft picks, cited for possession of marijuana in the past three months. Nick Fairley and Johnny Culbreath were arrested in separate incidents in Alabama and South Carolina, respectively, and Mikel Leshoure was ticketed twice after traffic stops in west Michigan.
That wasn't Tim Grendell's only wrongheaded battle. But there are pluses on his ledger, too. He has fought payday lenders, oil and gas drillers, and the Illuminating and Ohio Edison companies. Grendell's trouble: That's not how business is supposed to be done in a Senate that the Republicans have held for 25 years by making nice with select lobbies -- not waves.
Wait until next year?
Democrats at the Capitol say cuts since January total $15 billion, while Republicans say they believe spending reductions are actually around $7 billion. By either measure, California will look different.

Columbia University professor Andrew Delbanco's assertion that a college education should be a hedge against utilitarian values would not have sat well with my Grandma Stockman.
Security procedures at U.S. airports were unchanged despite the plot, a reflection of both the U.S. confidence in its security systems and a recognition that the government can't realistically expect travelers to endure much more. Increased costs and delays to airlines and shipping companies from new security measures could have a global economic impact too.
James E. Martin
It was a calculated gamble for both sides. By offering a one-year deal, the Blazers could lose Oden to free agency after this season. But at the same time, they limited their losses should Oden become injured again. For Oden, his signing with Portland ensured he would get the highest single-season payday available, while allowing him to become an unrestricted free agent next summer. But he also left himself at risk should he become injured again.

So the Kent list will be helpful, Jerse said.
Union concessions are considered the key to Mayor Dave Bing's turnaround plan because pension and health care costs are skyrocketing while the city's tax base continues to diminish.
The focus on outpatient services was spotlighted at the board meeting when MetroHealth Vice President of Marketing and Communications Phyllis Marino passed out a brochure on expanded services at the health system's Beachwood location. That site, which has more than doubled in size in the past year, now offers a long list of specialties including digital radiology, bone density screenings and pain management procedures.

"Steve is still going to get his 10, 11, 36 assists," Frye said. "There's another facet of his game he'll have and that's scoring. ... We have to make it work. That's what they pay us the big bucks for. We've got to do what we do and a little bit more than that."

The 483-foot-tall building now known as the Chase Tower opened, becoming (and still remaining) the tallest structure in Arizona. It has continually been occupied by banks -- first Valley National Bank, which subsequently was sold to Bank One and then to Chase. It stimulated interest in downtown Phoenix for a time, with numerous other skyscrapers and other buildings going up in the 1970s and '80s.
A year ago, Obama made good on his campaign talk. He authorized a mission into Pakistan to kill Osama bin Laden, and it worked. So he earned the right to crow a little.
Khalid excelled at Mount Hebron, where he was on the honor roll and won an honorable mention in a city writing contest for an essay titled "Voices Around the World." He also earned a full scholarship to Hopkins and planned to enroll there last fall, but withdrew after his arrest.
The vibe: There's an Old World-meets-New World feel at Korbel. The original red brick winery, now offices and a stop on the tour, looks like a chateau (a real one, not the Napa Valley kind), complete with a rose garden growing some 250 varieties. But the huge old redwoods around it plant Korbel squarely in Northern California. The tasting room is new, elegant and professionally run, and a deli offers gourmet sandwiches and salads and space to eat them either inside or outside.
The book is just one part of a Sensational Alex Harvey Band renaissance. The People's Palace museum in Glasgow is currently hosting an exhibit on the group called "Alex Harvey -- A Tribute" that has been held over due to popular demand, with more than 2,500 people attending the opening.

But some of the 17,000 customers in the state still without power as of this morning are venting.
It's a lesson in the various frustrations of this place. As airports go, LAX, which entered the jet age in 1961, is an antiquity. From taxi ways to terminals, it's all squeezed into one of the smallest footprints of any major U.S. airport: 3,425 acres compared to Dallas-Ft. Worth's 18,076. There is nowhere else to go but up.
And that’s the irony. Bridges is a far better craftsman than Wayne. The Coen brothers are much better directors than Henry Hathaway. Hell, their “True Grit” is even a better-made film than the old “True Grit.”
In a rare joint statement last week, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called for a U.N.-backed panel to investigate remaining inmates believed jailed for political reasons. The government hasn't responded.
Although it's easy to dwell on sensationalist and unproven accusations, the facts are that Rural/Metro was and continues to be an exceptionally strong partner with the City and proudly serves the residents of the City as it has for the last 14 years.
Edwardsville was 20 of 43 from the field, but struggled beyond the arc, making only four of 19 3-point attempts. Eisenhower had its own problems, committing 20 turnovers.
In a second report, the government said inventories held by businesses grew 0.9 percent in September. It was the ninth straight monthly gain. And total business sales rose 0.5 percent, the best showing since July.
If federal strings get in the way of creating an effective job-training program, the state should urge the feds to snip them. And Ohio businesses, which have not always been forthcoming about their work-force needs, must help by being open about their requirements.
If Sept. 11 is to become part of the American myth and identity, it will do so not because of the unabashed evil of its perpetrators. It will be because of the self-sacrifice of many individuals in the planes and towers; the heroic efforts of first responders as they stared death in the face and did their duty; the months of respect that rescue workers brought to the dead and the sites where they died; the almost unimaginable unity and generosity after the event of Americans and our friends around the world; and, most importantly to our future, the daily acts of courage of the parents and children who have persevered and built good lives for themselves from the dust of Sept. 11.
The start of any new school year can be stressful, but sending your little one off to preschool can be a time filled with many angst-filled questions: How well will my child adjust to preschool? Will my child make friends? Will the teacher understand my child?
Drastic measures are called for. Tim, adding that he's never done this before, asks the Nuts and Bolts to gather in a circle and all hold hands. Joshua snips to Bert, "Don't come near me!" Well, no, I made that up, but I could swear I saw those words in a thought bubble above Joshua's head. Tim wants them to vow that they will communicate and work together.
Here's a destination for Princess Diana's favorite dessert: bread-and-butter pudding, spiked with Bailey's Irish Cream ($7). Have shepherd's pie made with lamb instead of ground beef, served with brown bread ($8 lunch and $13 dinner).
Fleming predicted the bump St. Louis received in the study will resonate as the city as well as the global marketplace reposition themselves in the aftermath of the recession.
Some neighbors said it will remove a symbol that has haunted the neighborhood the last few years.
The quote Osweiler uses on his Twitter page is from late British economist Walter Bagehot, who said, "The greatest pleasure in life is doing what people say you cannot do."
"The toughest thing is they're in a competitive business with private competition," he said. "So what they have to figure out is how are they transparent at the same time they don't give away their competitive advantage."
But problems loom in Columbus. Democrats fear the political clout of teachers unions. And for some Republicans, anything that demands positive results from their deep-pocketed contributors in the charter school crowd makes them skittish. Just last year, House Speaker Bill Batchelder unsuccessfully tried to slip into the state budget a provision allowing the creation of taxpayer-financed schools with little government oversight, whose primary purpose would have been to turn a profit for their owners.
The latest fire was reported at 2419 SE 71st Ave. Firefighters found a detached garage on fire. They quickly knocked down the blaze, but bystanders urged the firefighters to save the chickens inside.
“It feels great to be a part of the Maryland Terps,” said Dodd, who has been to two Terps games at Comcast Center, including Tuesday night’s win over Miami. “I knew they were looking at me, but I was just waiting to see how things played out. When they offered me, it was pretty exciting and I verbally committed.”

A: I specifically wanted to do that. (Azaria's character) has gone from being a suburban dad to being a guy living in this apartment. We wanted a medium-sized city that allowed easy access to suburban and urban areas. I've always loved Portland, but we shoot in L.A. We do have our little magical backdrops that locate us in three different random locations in (Portland). I think the boss can see Mount Hood from his window. We're trying to figure out how to imitate the reality of Portland rain, grayness, trees, things like that. I know we already have one reference to a Timbers game.

Avakian said he asked his staff to see if his bureau had any jurisdiction to investigate the matter. They concluded that it did not because the woman was not working for the labor bureau at the time of the incident.
The worst part of Game 3 was also a Red Wings goal. Late in the second period, Johan Franzen, after a mad Detroit skirmish near the Nashville net, took a loose puck and fired it in. The red light lit. But so did the blue light. And when the smoke cleared, blue beat red by about a tenth of a second. A goal that would have tied the game was ruled never a goal at all.
Honda's luxury brand has slipped in recent years. Oddball looks and so-so performance left it behind other luxury brands.
‘‘It just seemed like it was a year where maybe a little bit more frustration set in than it should have,'' said Crawford, who had an .893 save percentage in the playoffs. ‘‘Overall, I look at it and it wasn't as bad a year as most people would think.

• Thunder 111, Blazers 107 -- Darnell Mayberry, Oklahoman: This was a great win. By far the best of the season. It wasn’t always pretty. But when you’re the best (by record), you’re going to get everyone’s best, and it’s going to sometimes be hard-nosed, physical contest. That’s what this was. And the fact that the Thunder came into the Rose Garden, where the Blazers had only lost once in 12 games, and slayed a team that was whupping opponents by an average of 18.3 points in their building, speaks volumes.
Just as at Spago and Cut, Puck relaxes the fine dining experience to just this side of informal. Service, as always, is crisp and warm.

What's the link? If you don't regularly brush and floss, tartar builds up on your teeth and irritates your gums. This bacteria-loving tartar turns to plaque, triggering bodywide inflammation. Next, LDL cholesterol-related plaque builds up in your arteries. From there, it's double the chance of heart disease.
It might be better to do what MTV did with "Laguna Beach," later "The Hills" -- break off the standouts into series of their own. Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi and Jenni "JWoww" Farley have already been busy pitching their ideas -- Snooki with a dating show, a la VH1's "I Love New York," only trashier, and JWoww with a "Shore"-style show, only set in the Hamptons. And trashier.

Buck's article, in the March 2011 issue of Vogue, drew widespread surprise and ridicule, especially among Washington's foreign-policy community, which had long regarded Syria as a regional troublemaker and leading violator of human rights.

McCue is also part of the valley's current wave of venture-backed entrepreneurs who are much more likely to be acquired than go the Wall Street route with an IPO. Unlike the bustling 1990s, when the vast majority of start-ups with venture backing dreamed of going public, the dominant trend today is in mergers and acquisition, or M&A.

"It's easy if you live in Palo Alto, where Stanford is and where it's safe, to be for this," Reynolds said.

And if you wouldn't want them next door to you, why would you put them next to any California family?"

Woods said the district learned of two specific incidents over the summer involving two different bands that violated the school district’s harassment and bullying policies. He would not be more specific except to say there were no injuries. Had the system learned of the infractions earlier, it would have suspended activities during marching band season, he said. Last week was the end of the football season, he said, and most marching is over. He said the ban doesn’t affect in-class instruction or other band activities.

Now, here’s where it got slightly ridiculous: Rolle said while he was with the Cardinals under Ken Whisenhunt “we had fun when we won and we had fun when we lost.” (On a somewhat related note, Phillips later said about the Giants’ fans, “I mean they’re great but at the same time, like you said, they can definitely be nasty. … But if you’re out there making plays they’re going to cheer for you they’re going to stand behind you. You just gotta give them something to cheer about and we didn’t do that this year.”)
The Wings played shorthanded for almost seven minutes during the first two periods, disrupting their flow, denying them scoring chances and digging them into a two-goal hole from which they couldn't escape, even after pounding Rinne with 19 shots in the last period.

The strange case of defensive lineman Lt. Ben Garland, the Air Force Academy graduate who was impressive in Broncos camp two years ago, also is in place. He had to report in 2010 to active duty and was placed on military/reserve. Later, Garland decided not to become a pilot, was given a press relations position and will finish his active duty this year. He could be a rookie again.
But the celluloid goddess had been quietly checking out some fella across the room. When the supremely territorial Yankee Clipper went to the men's room, the glances only got chancier.
But no one here had been planning a six-day expose on Texas abortion laws. No effective notice was given – and one can only wonder whether this was by design. So, we had no opportunity to seek other opinions, to balance the presentation, to add context or depth. We considered: On a moment's notice, should we remake our week's opinion pages around Trudeau's surprise? It seemed a calculated ideological ambush: Turn over your opinion pages, or else.

But in another case that demonstrates the hodgepodge nature of penalties for uncontrolled burning around the state, there was no criminal prosecution related to a fire in Ordway four years ago that was caused by a man burning trash in violation of a county burning ban. The fire killed two volunteer firefighters and destroyed or damaged three dozen homes and outbuildings.

Northfield Park might fight plans by Penn National Gaming Inc. to move its Raceway Park in Toledo to Austintown, in the Youngstown area. The Austintown site is just 50 miles from Northfield Park and the harness tracks would compete for horses and customers. Attorney Luther Heckman, the former head of the OSRC, represented Northfield Park at Monday's OSRC month hearing, seeking clarification of the relocation rules.
It's a spectacularly misconceived performance, and what's remarkable about "The Tourist" is that Depp's not even the worst thing about the movie. That honor goes to Angelina Jolie, who adopts her own affected accent (a kind of Madonna-ese British) and struts through the proceedings with an imperious stare that closes off all other performers. Her Elise Clifton-Ward is supposed to be a madly romantic woman who falls in love all the time, but the only one Jolie is in love with here is herself.
The issue has become increasingly critical, Hare and other HIV experts said, as the recession sends more people below the poverty line while government programs that provide housing and other social services face threats to their funding.

“I’m always a defender first, but when the game opens up hopefully I can attack the space and help Dane a little bit more, because whenever he got the ball in the first game they always had two guys covering him,” Solli said. “It was almost impossible for him to outrun his fullback, so if I can make it like a two-against-two challenge it will be easier for him. He has a great skill with his pace, and if you can get him into the back space that will open up the game and give us a lot of options.”
Meanwhile, Curry County commissioners will decide March 15 whether to put a 3 percent sales tax on the May ballot. It would be Oregon's first county sales tax if approved, and would produce enough revenue to cover a projected $3 million deficit.

Heckert's had two drafts. And now this is his second free agent shopping season. So we'll split the difference and call it Year 1A. The GM has a great situation. A boss with Super Bowl credentials supporting him and publicly commending his work. A patient and dog-loyal fan base thrilled -- at least for now -- to see a front office with a plan, any plan.

You need a little black dress. I'm a fan of a high neckline; it's a vintage look that I like a lot. I went on tour this summer with my sister. We went to 30 cities and hit all of the vintage stores we could find. We found the best fashions in New York City, of course, but Portland was my favorite place with the most vintage stores. The fashions there aren't totally my style, but the people really are themselves. They don't care what anyone thinks. I saw someone looking cool in a belted garbage bag and mismatched boots. Totally acceptable! I love to wear items from the places I've been, that's important to me.

Against that tumult, Act II is another world. On the sparse stage, Chu and five others (Eric Beauchesne, Yannick Matthon, Jirí Pokorny, Cindy Salgado and Jermaine Maurice Spivey), slash and freeze in pristine angles, contort, tangle, and ricochet. They are liquid and articulate, mirroring the crackle and shatter of the score or rippling in floppy gymnastics.
If this isn't a perfect example of why the U-T is bleeding readership, I don't know what is. Apparently the Republican Party in San Diego (who also is bleeding voter identification) and their endorsed mayoral candidate now have the U-T doing its bidding. It's clear the local Republican Party has an inability to clearly articulate ideas that draw people to its mission.

The Rebecca Bloomwood character who indeed details the "Confessions of a Shopaholic" on screen bears minimal resemblance to the bodacious buyer fashioned by author Madeleine Wickham (a.k.a.

But that doesn’t spoil what is a lovely film, all extreme close-ups of chimps grooming, eating (with their mouths open), working out which rocks or sticks are good for cracking nuts and which aren’t. Watching the chimps hunt tiny monkeys (nothing remotely graphic is shown) for food is a lesson in role-playing, teamwork and elementary tactics. We see them build their intricate “sleeping platforms” at night, wash their food and pass down knowledge from parents to children. The detail presented here is amazing.

What does Scott do tonight, and for the next few games? None of the aforementioned options appeal to him. Perhaps he gives rookie power forward Tristan Thompson some time in the pivot. He supplied 13 rebounds and three blocked shots in his return to the lineup from a sprained ankle. But Thompson remains raw offensively and rarely passes the ball once he gets near the basket.
Marcel Proust, the great author of memory, gets a swift kick in the pants in Dan Simmons' latest novel of an apocalyptic future, "Flashback" (Reagan Arthur/Little, Brown: 560 pp., $27.99). Remember all that stuff Proust wrote about memories returning to him with the taste of a madeleine cookie?
