It’s the film’s score that stirs up the deepest emotions. The most uplifting music and lyrics can be heard by South African composer Mauritz Lotz along with international gospel artist Michael W. Smith. As a South African, it’s always exciting for me to see local landscapes draped across the big screen and the film does contain beautiful South African scenery. We really are blessed.
One of the core values in a liberal society is that people are free to think and act as they wish as long as they do not harm anyone else in the process; one of the hallmarks of the totalitarian society is its attempt to regulate, control and punish thought and behaviour, irrespective of whether it harms anyone else. The problem with allowing for attempt liability is that you may begin the slide from liberalism to totalitarianism. While we may feel comfortable treating Mike from Case A the same as Mike from Case B, in doing so we might set a dangerous precedent for future cases, a precedent that blurs the boundary between an attempt and a non-attempt.
GGE believes that widespread violence against women and girls points to deeply rooted gender discrimination that must be tackled as a peace-building and human rights priority.

That first sentence wasn't a complaint. Or not much of one. After all, worse things could happen to a person than being a writer. You could be, for example, an actor, where the odds are even worse, the pay inequity between the top and the bottom even wider, and the rejections far more personal (and usually delivered to your face).

So a little background about me…I am a mother to 2 wonderful sons aged 4 and 5, I am a full time mother at the moment, I am 17 days away from turning 30 (not that I am counting), I am currently in the process of getting divorced, I have lots of wonderfully supportive friends some from childhood and some I am still getting to know, I think I have faced the worst demons from an ugly childhood, I am an easygoing (most of the time!) and happy (usually) person, I love chats and coffee and I am very playful.

I did that, more or less, with my first husband. I was living at home and keeping the kind of hours only a college student is capable of surviving. My parent’s lived an hour away from school 20 min walk from a bus line that ran once an hour until 1am. He lived within a block of campus. I actually moved back home over the summer before moving out to a “real” apartment choosing intentionally to live with him rather than just crashing at his place.
Now, don't close your eyes or go to sleep - we don't want to miss the plot: after colliding with a comet, a nearly eight mile wide piece of the Orpheus asteroid is headed straight towards... guess where? That's right: Earth. And as anyone can tell you, if something eight miles wide hits a planet with life on... well, that's pretty much gonna do a number on whatever's living on said planet. How to stop threat? NASA wants to use a huge satellite created by American scientist Paul Bradley (Connery), who is all for it, even going so far as to helping get the extra power from a like Russian satellite headed by Russkie scientist Dubov (Brian Keith) and his assistant Donskaya (Natalie Wood) Of course, this being in the late Seventies, there's that whole United States vs. Russia thing going on. Not to mention that we also have the prerequisite elements of a crazy military guy (Martin Landau), a stubborn American government agent (Karl Malden), The President of the United States (Peter Fonda), lots of screaming extras and special effects so cheesy that this movie should have been funded by a grant from Kraft.

You can’t say ‘to hell with the well-being of the prisoner’, without also saying ‘to hell with the safety of the innocent.’ Our system is driven by emotional reactions which are not thought out at all, shaped by our knee-jerk hatred for difficult things we don’t like or don’t understand, and it makes everything worse. Prisoner’s families and loved ones are often left with shattered lives, mothers left to cope alone, dramatic losses of income, children confused and distressed. Prisoners cost a fortune to imprison when most don’t even need prison in the first place. Prison inflicts suffering and violence on people and makes them hugely vulnerable on release, and then society ostracises them for good measure. Our habit of refusing work, insurance and sometimes family life to ex-offenders keeps them vulnerable, powerless and without the things which might make them secure enough not to offend again. The offenders register just forces people underground in an effort to escape detection, so that the only people on it who the police can find are those who aren’t doing anything wrong anyway.

Between them, these two patriotic parties now have the support of 30% of the Austrian electorate.

This rotating focus on a handful of lawyers at the top obfuscates the importance of everyone else. Rainmakers come and go — and their seven-figure incomes survive. Bienenstock is an example. So are the many former Dewey management committee members who have already left, including John Altorelli, whose parting words showed little compassion for his former partners, associates, paralegals and staff.

This is where we get the conviction, which is limited to the fringes in ordinary times but spreads rapidly into the mass of the population in times of extreme social stress, that the existing order of society is the worst possible state of affairs, and that any change to it must therefore be a change for the better. This is binary logic in its purest form: the existing order is bad, therefore whatever replaces the existing order must be good; since the existing order is bad, it’s equated with every other bad thing, even those that contradict each other, while whatever is to replace the existing order, since it’s good, can’t be bad in any sense. Add in white-hot emotions on all sides of the equation, and you get today’s fringe politics—and quite possibly the mainstream politics of tomorrow.
If you watched it you will see what I mean. But did you also see how it is a piece of theatre, rather than a closely reasoned argument? He presents us with a view of human progress which, to condense Jeremy's argument, equates pretty much with increased energy consumption! Ergo, we must keep up the energy level! And then he pulls a whole lot of techno-speak out of the air, equating distributed information with distributed energy generation (see, one works, so the other must too!) and sketching out a sexy-sounding future with the whole world of little home generators linking together, busy making their contribution to the betterment of the human species! The young people know all about this kind of stuff 'cause they're on Facebook and Twitter! So lets get them all going on it.
Last April, Tresca posted a series of columns developing a game he called Crypts & Critters. The game is designed to introduce toddlers -- kids under 4, let's say -- to roleplaying concepts by further developing kids' natural instincts for imaginative play. I liked what I read and pulled everything together into a single document for archival purposes. It was ugly, and I planned on prettying it up. But before I did so, I thought that it would be cool to distribute it to others, too, so I write to Tresca and asked for permission to go ahead with this project, and emailed him my rough file.

Well, actually no, there is one thing about it that does not feel all that natural. If two people love each other, they want to be together and share their worlds, time and lives. But not in the case between parents and their grown-up kids. Because here I have a lot of love and care and closeness, yet this love story is slowly heading toward a separation.

It was not always thus. There are politicians in modern history whose command of language was sublime, people who could have lived in the great ages of the past, in the Athens of Pericles, people whose words will always be remembered for their perspicacity and transcendence. For me there are two in particular: Abraham Lincoln and Winston Churchill.

We met with the surgeon, who did awesome due diligence and had the skin sample retested not once, but twice. The results came back, different. Turns out it was atypical spitz nevis.

In the opinion of seminal scholar of world mythology Prof. J. Rendel Harris:
I think they need to have a fairly good grasp on it. I often hear writers say, I write because I do it for the love of it’. And that’s fine and really important. But if you are doing it for the love of it, why are you sending it to publishers? Because you want your tome of love to be published, right? The thing is it costs money to publish stuff. You’re also going to be asking strangers to give you money and invest in you and your IP. And those nice people who are giving you money want something back. And that’s usually more money than they’ve given you. So for traditional publishers, the business side of it is really important and it should be no different for self publishers, it’s just a massively different scale.

This is absolutely correct. So what? Publishing through Lulu, CreateSpace, or any other middleman service that charges a fee is also vanity publishing--yet authors who use these services routinely identify themselves as self-published or (shudder) "indie," and no one challenges them. Besides, the lines between self-publishing and vanity publishing have become so blurred over the past decade or so that I'm not sure this is a meaningful distinction any longer.
It's the truth of the situation.

Okay, so I understand the scene where Reese rescues Leila has to be cut short, but did the heavily armed gang members have to give up so easily? Reese creates a diversion with a beat-up old car, then shoots two of them. One of the Mexicans decides it’s no longer worth it, helps his buddy into the car, and drives off. It then becomes a standoff between Reese and one of Leila’s kidnappers, who has the baby in a duffel bag. Reese plugs him in the head, and the guy falls on his back with the bag landing gently on top of him. Not one of the more memorable POI action scenes.
Two weeks ago I was on a jury. The court stenographer sat facing me 20 feet away for 5 days; an attractive woman my age, she dressed in office-provocative style with lace tops that dipped to show cleavage between the open lapels of her business suit. She carried some extra, generous weight, big round ass, large legs in stockings and heels; fixed expression staring into space while she paid attention and transcribed dutifully. Although I love L and I don’t want anyone else, my mind was occupied for long stretches of listening to wiretap recordings, with the image of walking to the stenographer, weaving my fingers into her silver-blonde hair, and pulling her open mouth to my cock, smearing her lipstick, riding her tongue. She would either look up at me surprised, or would continue typing, eyes fixed in the middle distance while I pumped into her mouth.

There is a homeopathic remedy for just about every condition known to man. If you pick the right one, you will be amazed at the results; however, if you pick the wrong one, it just will not work. Because choosing the actual remedy is a little complicated, there are some excellent formulas that combine several remedies that work on similar symptoms. Common formulas are for common problems such as allergies, asthma, stress, sinus pain, cold and flu, sore throats, arthritis, and so on.

My favorite aspect of Pre-Service Training so far is learning the language (we are studying Moroccan Arabic which is called Darija). It is a mixture of Classical Arabic, Berber and some French (Berbers are the indigenous people of the region). Darija is a spoken language of the people, but is not formally written. Children learn Classical Arabic and then French in schools and can start learning English at the high school level; however, most Moroccans speak various Berber languages, Darija, or a mixture of these in their homes. I will be working at a youth center in which Darija will mainly be used, despite Classical Arabic being the language of instruction at schools. Several of the Moroccan PC staff members here speak at least five different languages fluently. (Yesterday was my birthday and I was sung to in three different languages!). Darija has a few sounds we are not used to making in English that are definitely challenging, but I have a good teacher who makes us practice over and over again and slowly I am picking it up. My throat is pretty sore from all the practice of these guttural sounds but already I feel I am improving.
For any FIFA players used to the traditional controls, it’s a very big change and we had to force ourselves to use the rear touchpad instead of going with what we were used to. The lack of finger triggers under the shoulder buttons is also jarring for anyone playing familiar PS3-like titles so whether it be FIFA or Uncharted, you’ll be needing to learn and get used to some new control methods.

He was a Marine in World War II and in the Korean War as well. His stories were infamous and made us laugh. He wedded my mom in 1946 and they stayed married for 63 years. He was a Labor Relations Negotiator before there was such a thing and would tell us stories of Jimmy Hoffa and late nights in Baton Rouge. He knew every good restaurant in the country because he traveled so much, meeting with boilermakers, electricians, masons, steel workers - you name it. He worked as a consultant until he was in his 70's.

First, it means that the Constitution is not being lived up to.

Favorite Syracuse Restaurant: When seeking restaurant recommendations for Syracuse, New York, nearly everyone mentioned Dinosaur Bar-B-Que. They were largely correct and I will add my recommendation as well. Forget the wine list, this is a place for beer, hard cider and cocktails. For food, go for items like the Catfish Strips, Cornbread and BBQ Pork Ribs. A casual place, service is very good and the prices are reasonable.
Yesterday, I met Tricia Foley for lunch and then we went to Lincoln Center to see the production of War Horse. I can't remember the last time a production so engrossed me. The play, which originated at the National Theater in London, won the TONY for best play of the year--and I don't think anyone could disagree. I am not a theater critic, but the sight of these huge puppets manipulated at times by three and four people, was awesome. The story is about the horses that served in the First World War--some bought from farmers in England. One such horse was beloved by a lad who gets himself into battle to find him. It is based on a children's novel, so I am sure you can figure out the ending. I did find the aspects of war upsetting--but then they should be, shouldn't they? This is not a play where you leave the theater tapping your foot or humming. It is a story that stays in the veins.

Most alcoholics exhibit mild-to-moderate deficiencies in intellectual functioning (6), along with diminished brain size and regional changes in brain-cell activity. The most prevalent alcohol-associated brain impairments affect visuospatial abilities and higher cognitive functioning (7). Visuospatial abilities include perceiving and remembering the relative locations of objects in 2- and 3-dimensional space. Examples include driving a car or assembling a piece of furniture based on instructions contained in a line drawing. Higher cognitive functioning includes the abstract-thinking capabilities needed to organize a plan, set it in motion, and change it as needed (2).

The Year In Review – The Worst TV Shows Of 2011 – Reality
At the same meeting in Salt Lake City, Joseph Esposito, CEO of giantchair.com proposed a five-stage model of the development of university press publishing – with University Presses currently in stage 3. I’d urge anyone thinking about the commercial structure of publishing to go to the AAUP website and download and read his presentation. I don’t fully agree with all of it – and I am not at all sure he is right about the texture and structure of stages 4 & 5. However – like all of the most useful presentations, Esposito’s session crystallised for me in a moment something that I had gradually been realising over a long time – but had not ever articulated to myself. And that is that the publishing industry is preparing for its future while being funded by its past, unlike new media and technology companies – which are preparing for the future at the same time as being funded by that future – in the form of Venture Capital and other start-up funding mechanisms.

However, we are now living in different times. America is no longer institutionally racist and there are few people who feel it is appropriate to mouth openly racist tropes, even if some still think them. I have worked with many Black patients and appreciate that they have to negotiate various difficulties that I have been spared but the sad truth of it is that the primary damage that racism still exerts on our Black countrymen and women is self inflicted.

A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal ran a feature ("High school, only shorter") on the handful of states that now give scholarships to students who complete high school early.

Indiana, Minnesota, Utah, South Dakota and Idaho all have programs that create an incentive for kids to start college early.

I read that line in an article today about women who put off having children in order to pursue their education/career/dream of living in a foreign country first. Only when they reach the height of their preconceived "life before kids" ideal do they settle down and start a family. And once they have kids, they easily transition into a life of full-time working mom. Or so it may seem.

Now that I had just explained a whole huge paragraph about ‘how to’ learn about my blog ‘what is’ my blog about, I will give a quick summary of what I’ve been doing over the past time since I remember (another reason I write on this blog, to remember the past and it’s good ol’ and bad ol’ times). Well, I’ve been doing a thing called Parkour a lot recently during the beginning of the school year with two friends. But now, ever since, I’ve influenced a lot of children, pre-teens, and teenagers to perform some Parkour stunts with me. So, now, I’ve been doing this thing a lot with a lot more people. I’ve also been studying really hard and thoroughly. Since I have decided that I do not do much activities when I’m quickly done with school and that during the weekdays no one’s outside, I decided to study really hard and be extra focused in school. In result, my grades have been higher than ever.

My naked body straddles you and you are wearing nothing but your sexy new boxers. I slip my fingers just inside and run them along the waistband, teasing you. I can see you getting harder inside them, a perfectly formed parcel for me to unwrap…..with my teeth! I pull them off and gasp as I see how hard you are. Uncontrollably I reach out for you. I know you are aching for my touch. I trail my finger down your exquisite torso, running it down the middle with my finger nail, then stop to kiss your navel, it is so sexy, I love that part of you.
Waking up to Macca is a highlight of the weekend - Mark.
“What was that?” Travis asked with a grin, having heard every word she said.
His followers tittered in nervous excitement as they waited for my response. I smiled indulgently before making the following reply: “They might well do, laddie, but only if they were hungry. Perhaps you could answer a question that’s been puzzling me. Is it true that a human boy will lie on his arm before he masturbates so that his hand will feel like someone else’s?”
This is where the feed holder came in:
The story itself is a kind of fairy tale, a perfect form for all it seems to want to say and be. (Fairy tales can be sources of delight. At the same time, they can be unsettling. Consider, for instance, "The New Mother". Delightfully unsettling.) This is not a story about the harsh, realistically real realities of gritty reality — or, rather, this is not primarily that, because it is that, yes, but by way of misdirection and sleight of hand.
Today is the monthly guild meeting. The program for today is our Challenge Quilts.
This will be short and sweet, because I have to wake up for my (last) 8:30am lecture in a short 6 hours. But this weekend was a splendid one, filled with lots of yummy food and time with a few of my favorite people. I spent the majority of the weekend downtown exploring new areas of the city, that I am now in love with. Tomorrow is my last day of classes this semester, and thus the end of my 3rd year of university. I still can't believe how fast it is going by.

Good morning friends! We had a great day at The Gypsy Market yesterday. Unfortunately, due to miscommunication we will be unable to sell cupcakes we planned to sell there today. Sooooo, we need to sell 200 cupcakes today! If you did not have a chance to see us at one of our fall markets, this is a great way to try some D'Lish variety! The complete list is below! They are $3.00 each, can be purchased in any quantity, and can be picked up at my house any time today! Please call my cell by 1:00 if you would like us to reserve any for you (832-594-4955). After 1:00 we will be delivering any that have not been reserved to local businesses/offices as samples. Please pass this along to anyone you think might be interested. Thanks!
I then figured that while they were away on vacation, I would seize the opportunity to go visit my family back home. When the mother found out I was doing this she said "Oh, so this will count as your 2-weeks vacation then?" I felt trapped. Strike #2.

This is a screwup of epic proportions, honestly, right up there with SOE’s screwup last year. There’s a certain level of nausea accompanying my typing the following sentence: SOE handled their situation better. They found out about the problem promptly, shut down everything, made sure things were nice and secure, and then gave a heap of compensation to everyone affected.

The British drugstore chain, Boots, started selling their products here in the United States in the recent past. The skincare routine Amy (my sis) is using is from their No 7 line. I used the daytime and nighttime moisturizers, as well as the Beauty Serum, and I was hooked after just one use. So I picked up the line myself and have been using it for about a week now. For real - my skin looks better. I don't know what's so different about it but my skin is thanking me!
So many people in my life credit me for their renewed interest in fitness and being healthy. A friend of mine, after running her second 5K, started telling people that without her coach (referring to me) it wouldn’t have been possible. I am NOT the healthiest person, by far. I need to drop some weight still and I don’t always have the cleanest nutrition. One thing I can say I have, is the undying drive to make myself a better person. I even had a volunteer position training people to run their first ever 5K and got the honor of watching three of them do so; I also watched SO many in that group go from walking only to running. It was such a great feeling, I was sad when the session ended.
Well she did. And as she spoke more words that I couldnt comprehend, my face began to contort into this look of extreme dissapointment. Not even at him, but myself. I knew it, I thought. I knew I couldnt trust him. It was actually kind of ironic since I had been someone he cheated with before we got together officially, that SHE (whoever she was) would be calling me to tell me that he was now cheating on me.

I hate to sound like a snob. I don't think I'm a snob. I was really, really into the Dude. I was pretty into Farmer, too, and quite entangled with him, dating him for 5.5 months and giving him my post-divorce virginity. But let's look at my friends' cell phone situations, by point of contrast with these guys:
“The idea of energy independence was first conceived in response to the 1973 Arab oil embargo. The embargo abruptly cut-off U.S. oil imports from the Middle East causing severe fuel shortages and gas rationing. Oil prices tripled, the price of gasoline quadrupled and a new American vulnerability was exposed — America’s dependence on imported oil as a primary source of energy proved to be a weakness that could be exploited to influence or subvert U.S. foreign policy; threatening to disrupt the economy and eventually impoverish the USA by transferring billions of dollars to foreign national treasuries in exchange for oil.”(2)

Senna was very successful in the junior formulae in Brazil and in England. He begun karting at the tender age of four. For him, racing was in his blood and so to was his will and desire to win. To him, second place wasn’t acceptable; he felt it was first of the losers. He underlined that ruthless streak early on in his career, in the tense and exciting duel with Britain’s Martin Brundle for the 1983 British Formula 3 Championship. Senna dominated the first half of the season, Brundle the second half and it left Ayrton to pull off some crazy overtaking attempts that often ended in accidents. Eventually he overcame Brundle in the season finale at Thruxton and Formula One beckoned.

Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and exhilirating. But she’s bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the prince starts to show interest in her... but it’s the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand her best.
Marty also appears loyal to his pod, but I do question that loyalty. By the end of the season, although I wanted to believe that Marty would stand by his team, I still felt that everything he did was to manipulate them to achieve the outcome he wanted.
Reading over these reasons, I can see clearly why I never wanted to go on a break. All of these reasons make the parties involved with the break seem weak. They’re too afraid to make a final decision, so they want to leave the door open for the possibility of getting back together, but they’re not entirely sure that’s what they want. It’s very wishy-washy and noncommittal, and it just doesn’t seem like it makes any sense, to sensible people.
It seems that the community group will make a submission to NAMA tomorrow 26th April, presumably in the hope that the auction will be cancelled and the property sold to the community group. The property appears to be listed on the latest NAMA foreclosure list as a “Development – Not Commenced” and “Agricultural Land” in Rathcronan and Ballymacross in Granard. Groups elsewhere in Ireland will be watching to see how NAMA deals with this property.

I have been riding Cole with Starry in the evenings on short rides, and they have gone very well together. I knew what to expect as far as behavior. The trip to the big river went just as good as expected. Starry went right down the bank into the water without any encouragement from Cole. I showed Kevin the smoothest place to cross. It went without a hitch. On the other side, he followed Cole up the bank, and we were on the good trail.

This is a big month for self reflection and truth telling. What are you committing to unconsciously? Is it what you want? Tell the truth. There is tremendous personal growth possible this month as it supports growing up and taking personal and full responsibility for your life. If you do this you will be of great service to the planet as an example. If everyone were to do this, how the planet would change. It is already happening but we can all help by doing our part and becoming fully responsible. It starts with reviewing your commitments. If you do the work, you should find yourself greatly inspired by a sense of power and the relief that comes from truth and clarity.

In addition to their findings on the online document presented by the White House, the Posse also addressed problems with Obama’s Selective Service registration card.
At best, Thompson asserts, Calvin means by his classification the possibility of “a suspension of the rules, not a change” (4). Thus, there may be occasions when the voice of a woman in church will be called for or at least unavoidable, but these occasions do not permit “a change in polity but a temporary suspension thereof in circumstances of necessity or emergency” (5), a position Calvin is not the first to hold (re. Vermigli).

By and large, Burke’s stance was the intellectual driving force behind Anglo-American conservatism from Burke’s own time until the late twentieth century, though of course—politics being what they are—it was no more exempt from being used as rhetorical camouflage for various crassly selfish projects than were the competing ideas on the other end of the political spectrum. Still, beginning in the 1920s, a radically different sense of what conservatism ought to be took shape on the fringes of the right wing in America and elsewhere, and moved slowly inward over the decades that followed. The rise to power of the neoconservatives in 2000 marked the completion of this trajectory.

The balanced portfolio returned 14.18% YTD. This is again with the novel of “follow me” trading. In all our trades we trade as close to the closing price if possible, or better. Everything I do can be replicated by you easily. One trade, per stock, a day. Sure with a large number of stocks this could be quite daunting, but we trade in smaller groups. What should be real alluring is that we can calculate the risk of our trade in dollars, so before you make the trade you know at that moment what your risk level is. As time goes on it may rise or fall letting you see the risk you are holding. We have stuck to the idea that we never touch the client’s money.

So I’m glad to now have my shows to look forward to. Some may argue that watching these types of shows can be a waste of time and also that our lives shouldn’t revolve around our TV schedule. Lee and I have even discussed this ourselves. For me, though, these shows provide me with a chance to sit back and relax. It’s almost an excuse to sit down and focus on nothing else but being entertained (even though I often am doing something else while watching).

Cardinal (Augustine) Bea (a German Jesuit), Cardinal (Leo) Suenens (from Belgium), Cardinal (Joseph) Frings (from Germany), Cardinal (Franz) Koenig (from Austria).

When you consider just how much more effective it makes a horror film to care about the characters the lazyness is even more unfathomable. When you actually do get a likable horror protagonist (ala Alison Lohman in Drag Me To Hell) it’s almost a shock. It’s all the more surprising as Drew’s part shows here how easy it is to do. She's not playing a particularly well drawn or deep character, just a deeply and instinctively sympathetic one. Underneath it all is the lie that if you’re bad bad things will happen to you and if you’re good vica versa. This is especially damning because this is exactly the opposite of what the great horror films tap into. The power of the random to strike you any time anywhere, that shadow on your lungs in the X-ray, that Vodka fueled driver crossing the center line. Nice person? Kind to animals? Good to your kids?

I can go back and forth about where Pink Floyd succeed (Animals is a tight, powerful concept album) and stumble (Most of the noodling on the studio album of Ummagumma goes nowhere and sounds like the soundtrack of a psychedelic B-grade horror movie). However, I cannot fail to pay tribute to the presence of Syd Barrett in the band’s early career. Like Waters, he too seemed obsessed with the subject of the mind and perception. Maybe it was the acid, but his lyrical contribution comes from a world beyond Waters’ depressed realm. No one could capture the “Twilight Zone” quality of Barrett’s words, from the opening lines of the opening track on Pink Floyd’s debut full-length, 1967′s The Piper at the Gates of Dawn: “Lime and limpid green a second scene/A fight between the blue you once knew” to the closing lines of the final track of the final Barret/Pink Floyd album, 1967′s A Saucerful of Secrets: “And the sea isn’t green/And I love the Queen/And what exactly is a dream/And what exactly is a joke.” Barrett would go on to be institutionalized for paranoid schizophrenia, the result of his well-known abuse of LSD, and then die whilst living at home with his mother in 2006 of complications from diabetes. Barrett was a living legend, madness personified, yet he seemed in tune with the greater mystery of existence in this universe that few know and understand.

The first book I read on my own was The Cat in the Hat, by Dr. Seuss. I memorized it first, then spoke it aloud as I turned the pages. Eventually, the mysterious black marks on the page began to take on meaning as letters and words. I began reading on my own and fell in love with Astrid Lindgren’s Pippi Longstocking, A.A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh and, later, Madeleine L’Engle’s A Wrinkle in Time and J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings. I also read comic books, maps, series fiction like Nancy Drew and The Hardy Boys, and nonfiction, especially books about dance. We visited the public library regularly, returning home with our arms weighed down by stacks of books.

I think a lot you know, and that is kind of... bad. I talked about that with Joan yesterday, she laughed at me, probably because she was telling me that she thinks a lot, then I told her I didn't like to. I think about things I wasn't supposed to, I think about my past, about things I did. Not that I regret, but you just feel that sometimes you left something undone, unfinished, and I feel bad. I completely love my life, love my boyfriend, love my besties, but there's just something missing. I gave up something to have another, and I don't regret my choice. I am so happy right now, but I don't know why am I crying. I absolutely love the relationship I'm in, and I absolutely love my friends and I love having them all around me, but there's just a little detail that I don't know what it is. I'm trying to think what is it, but I can't. I don't know what's going on in my mind right now, but as soon as I find out, I'll write.

Only time and the collective judgement of fellow Sepia Saturday contributers will tell, but I may be able to make a claim as the closest follower of Alan's theme this week. I believe this young lady, pictured in an unnamed 4¼" x 3¼" paper print from c.1910-1914, and doing her best to ignore the persistently annoying younger brother still in nappies, is well into her training for a career to be spent astride ponies of the inanimate kind. Judging by her apparent age, she may even be the same curly-headed young Queenslander who later caught the roving eye of that wheeled toy horse in 1937.

#1 Credit Suisse's Fixed Income Research unit: "We seem to have entered the last days of the euro as we currently know it. That doesn’t make a break-up very likely, but it does mean some extraordinary things will almost certainly need to happen – probably by mid-January – to prevent the progressive closure of all the euro zone sovereign bond markets, potentially accompanied by escalating runs on even the strongest banks."

Bears have a very distinctive odor. They smell very earthy probably because they love their dens. Male bears tend to have a stronger odor than females. Also, remember that if you see cubs, momma’s not far away. Back away quickly and leave the area. Do not run or you will attract the momma’s attention. If you are in a forested area that is known to have bears, then make some noise while walking. Talk with friends. If you are alone, say “Hey, Bear!” loudly. You don’t need to scream it, but it does need to be loud enough to warn any bears that might be nearby. Some hikers put bells on their backpacks. However, some bear experts warn that this attracts bears because they’ve learned that where there’s a bell, there’s food.

That said, I have booked some personal training sessions for myself this week, for yesterday and tonight, and I’m planning on going to personal training sessions three times a week from now on, to get my butt into gear and to finally lose masses of weight instead of a couple of pounds here and there. Right now, I wish I could take a few months off work so I could personal train for six to eight hours a day (cough), just to get to where I want to be quickly but I can’t, so this is the next best option for me. I cheat when I’m in the gym. I say I’m going to do 25 minutes of Cross Training or whatever, but I will always slyly decrease my time because no one is watching me do it. So I need that trainer there to tell me what to do and make sure that I do it. This will be my way of life for the next few months, and at the moment, I am dreading it because I know, to start with, I will feel completely knackered before I feel completely awesome.

The defining feature, besides interesting accomplishments, of the snotty accomplished bitch is that she’s REALLY self-involved (which is usually why she’s so accomplished). All that adoration your girlfriend shows towards her? I assure you the admiration is in only one direction. In fact, THAT friend, in this instance, maybe several people’s THAT friend. They have affection for your girlfriend to be sure, but only in so far as your girlfriend/date helps to keep the cycle of crowd adoration going. As long as one more story can be told of the awesomeness.
Okay, enough prelim. We slid up through the Adirondacks (sedately; I've discovered the zen of mileage, and got 43 mpg over the whole trip (I think Jack was somewhat chagrined by the calmness of my driving)), smoothed down onto the flats outside of Plattsburgh, and just before the border, yes, I did realize that my cell plan was stupid expensive in Canada, and called my family and asked them to only call me for emergencies (something Jack would twist cruelly at every occasion into "He told his family to stop calling him.").

This book shows the extraordinary success of people’s war in giving the ANC a virtual monopoly on power. It also shows, in part at least, the great cost at which this was achieved. Apart from the killings, the terror, and the destruction that marked the period from 1984 to 1994, the people’s war set in motion forces that cannot easily be reversed. For violence cannot be turned off ‘like a tap’, as the ANC suggested, and neither can anarchy easily be converted into order.
This is what I wrote: “One of the biggest Islamophobes sitting in Government is Phil Woolas, who deserves further scrutiny in this column. He was the minister for race relations in the autumn of 2006 when he intervened in the row over the classroom assistant Aisha Azmi by calling for her to be fired. Aisha was the girl who work a niqab over her face whenever a male colleague entered the room, but by the time he and the media had finished you would have thought Aisha spent her entire teaching days in a full face veil. This is the MP who during the last General Election stamped the Union Jack emblem on his campaign literature and highlighted 'anti-white racism' as a vital issue in his Oldham constituency. His mates told him it was political suicide and that he would lose his marginal seat but in fact his votes increased and sent the anoraks in Labour’s spin machine into statistical overdrive. They realised then they didn’t need to try and win back the disaffected Muslims who ditched Labour over Iraq and Afghanistan. So instead of trying to bring them back into the fold, these cynical politicians opted instead to stir up racial tension as a means of appealing directly to the white working-class vote”.
Naomie didn't seem too interested, I think it was still a bit advanced for her yet but she did play with a couple of twigs while I was helping Leyla do the sticking. We scrunched down the paper bag then squirted a whole load of craft glue all over the sides. I got Leyla to press twigs all around the outside. She wasn't too convinced because it was a bit messy haha, she kept saying "Oh no, I've got glue on my fingers" haha. She's definitely her mother's daughter! She kept at it though and we got it done. I then squirted some glue in the middle and we laid some twigs in there for the birds to sit on.
And whether it’s the nearness of Boston or the educational level that the two esteemed local colleges bring to the members of the Wellesley community, there’s a sense of worldliness about Dana Hall that I haven’t felt at any other school I’ve ever visited. It isn’t connected with the amount of international students who attend the school (though there are plenty), but rather it seems that everyone – students, faculty, and staff – all take a significant effort to look outside of their surroundings and seize every opportunity to examine the outside world and relate it to their own lives. In that vein, Dana Hall students also have an opportunity to do School Year Abroad and study off-campus during their high school careers – a rare piece of programming for a high school.

In answer to the title question, I think I will begin with my nemesis, Elizabeth Zimmerman’s Adult Surprise Jacket, or ASJ for short. The ASJ is back in time-out. It has been behaving very badly and doesn’t deserve my attention. I have tried to seam up the sleeves and shoulders using umpteen different methods, and everything I have tried comes out looking like hell. I hate this project more than any other knitting project I have ever done. I’d rather knit a 4ft x 7ft afghan with Red Heart yarn than make an ASJ with pure cashmere. As much as I love EZ, I have to say that this design is a big stinker.

b) The palm tree does not depend on the showers of rain… it drinks in water from the depths of the subterranean streams… It depends on the root system. Too many believers depend on blessings only for refreshment… When the blessings stop, they wither and die… People with no roots fall when trials come (Mark 4:17). Get your refreshing from the depths of the Spirit of God… Put some roots down (Proverbs 12:3, Ephesians 3:17-19)…

Corporations, run by contracts, have reason to run lean and mean. Profit is the bottom line, and profit does not lend itself to love of God and others being the first rule of behavior. But the church should not be lean and mean, it should be deep and wide, where it reflects compassion, kindness, sacrificial love, nurture to growth, and holds itself together by the divine and human acts of forgiveness and reconciliation.
Indeed, APCO’s time in Malaysia was marked by controversy. So too was the most recent hire of a team purportedly comprising ex-staff of former British PM Tony Blair’s “New Labour” campaign. This group was tasked to turn Najib into a ‘Mr Cool’ and to reinvent him as a moderate reformist. Once the news leaked, it was clear Najib had bungled again, losing millions of public money. Malaysian either laughed or disapproved at the ‘nonsense’ he was dishing out. Even his ‘Ah Jib Gor’ Facebook website has failed miserably. Aimed to attract the Chinese, it has been taunted as being silly, in bad taste, and a desperate political move.

It's been many years since I read Born on the Fourth of July, the story of Ron Kovic and the terrible aftermath of his time served in Viet Nam, yet I still can recall my response and the tears shed while reading his closing words remembering a particular day in his young life, a moment of almost unbearable poignancy, before the war and the wheelchair. He wrote, "There was a song called "Runaway" by a guy named Dell Shannon playing one Saturday at the baseball field. I remember it was a beautiful spring day and we were young back then and really alive and the air smelled fresh...."

Is it possible to say anything concrete in this respect at all? There is one observation that is surely worth making. Given the strength of the state in all Western European countries, and the legitimacy it enjoys (deservedly, as a brief look at vast swathes of the Earth’s surface will make clear), it seems highly unlikely that it will simply disintegrate in the manner outlined in the fictional scenario that makes up the first section of this document. Though new, non-governmental organizations will surely spring up to supplement or contend with the organs of state in response to Islamization, it seems safe to assume that the apparatus of state in European countries will continue to occupy centre-stage in this drama for some time yet.

Hmmm. Okay, Blogger, I see that you have made some "improvements" here, new dashboard, some new and fancy looking publishing options which I am too tired to explore right now, but let's get one thing straight. For the past few years, my entire blogging career to be exact, you have required me to upload my photos in reverse order so that they will appear chronologically on the blog. Naturally I cursed you for this many times early on in my blogging, but over time I learned to live with this bizarre quirk of yours. And now suddenly, it occurs to you that maybe JUST MAYBE photos should appear in the order in which they were uploaded.

Earlier this year, I read an article about what Sesame Street can teach writers to do: to write in "the monster at the end of the book". This is where a writer knows how to draw readers in with a bit of a promise of a "treat" by the end of the book. McCafferty has honed this craft well with the 5-book series, making skeptical readers (like myself) keep on reading, trying to search for that monster at the end...

It looks as though we are heading for some momentous events quite close in the future.

Such dire poverty is evident in Sarawak’s rural areas, where alienation of native land for logging and oil palm has stripped communities of their natural assets, their traditional self-sufficiency and independence. Some villages have been paid compensation but mostly on grossly unfavourable terms for land leases that would generate millions for the concessionaires. With little opportunities for cash income, most rural youngsters have migrated to the cities or outside Sarawak in search of work. Those villagers who have remained are dependent on poorly paid labour positions in companies operating on their former land, along with petty government handouts.

#729 - ¡Que viva Mexico! (1931/1979) - (#631 on TSPDT) When one thinks Sergei Eisenstein, one probably does not automatically think of the history and culture of Mexico. Yet, here it is. Shot by Eisenstein in 1931 but never completed until 1979, thirty one years after the great Soviet director's death. Edited and finished by Eisenstein's friend and colleague Grigori Aleksandrov, this film is by far the director's most romanticized and naturalistic film - though much of this could have been Aleksandrov's touches. A fascinating piece of motion picture history that works as a look into the non-partisan side of the director (though there is a revolutionary section of the film) as well as his most pure and unadulterated cinematic work. This film can stand alongside any of the director's Soviet works of the 1920's any day.

Preferring the approach of amending an existing statute to enacting a wholly new one, the Bill inserts a new Part into the existing Consumer Protection Act 1999, namely Part IIIA intituled Unfair Contract Terms. This Part contains new sections 24A to 24J all intended to address the issue of when businesses seek, via standard form contracts, to impose on consumers terms excluding or limiting their liability when they arise, as well as other terms thought generally considered unfair. Section 1(3) provides that the Part applies to contracts entered into after the coming into force of the Bill.

In his introduction, Litfin explains how one is considered a church father: he/she must be “ancient, orthodox in doctrine, holy in life, and approved by other Christians” (p. 19). He then highlights three common misconceptions evangelicals have about these giants of the faith: 1) the church fathers were not biblical; 2) the church fathers were Roman Catholics; and 3) the church fathers represent the “fall” of Christianity (pp. 20-27). Perhaps the second is the most widely held misconception. Unfortunately, evangelicals have equated “catholic” with “Roman Catholic” and have thus been robbed of their rightful spiritual heritage (p. 22). “Catholic,” as it relates to the fathers, writes Litfin, “referred to the unified community of all true believers in the world: those whose loyalty was given to the risen Christ” (p. 23).

He maintained that he is carrying out a public service that is also of benefit to the ­profession. Law firms can pay £299 to have all current and future traces of their name removed from the site. Alternatively, they can pay between £99 and £199 to have specific postings deleted.

It reminds us that seeking life changing experiences is not just the province of the young and beautiful and that people other than white middle-class males making a living out of travel writing have a right to comment on the world. That their experience, while different, is equally valuable, equally interesting. Over the Hill and Far Away is both different and differently interesting. I have no desire to travel the world.

We should also recognize that honoring the king of Israel had special significance. The king held a very special position of honor. We need to understand honor in that light. When we see that David honors Saul as “God’s anointed,” and in so doing, honors the “Anointed One” who was to come we should begin to get the right idea. As the Old Testament revelation progresses, this becomes more and more clear.

But I think we could achieve comfort too. I imagined tonight what that might look like. I think we had some of it. Our conversations by the fire, on the back porch, sipping tea. Tea he made for me. It felt comfortable and I felt like I was at home. I imagine him working on his projects, me curled on the couch writing or reading or working on genealogy. I imagine walks holding hands in the woods, exploring. I imagine rubbing each other’s feet while we watch a movie. I think it would be amazing to help with his little houses. My grandma used to do small scale miniature houses and such.
Still, there’s hope, so I make daily resolutions instead of yearly ones. I have a list of a dozen do’s and don’ts that I would follow in a perfect world. I’m lucky to do about half of them each day, but it varies. Two days ago I did only a couple. Yesterday I did all but two. Today, of course, I resolve to follow everything on my list. The list includes such things as weight lifting and stretching, walking, writing, blogging, promoting, eating a big salad, drinking lots of water, staying away from sugar and wheat. As I said, in a perfect world . . .

Regarding brain functioning, it is important to refer to the cerebellum, the area of the brain responsible for voluntary physical movement is connected by neurons to all parts of the cortex, the area of the brain responsible for higher order thinking. Nearly 80 studies have suggested a strong link between the movement and memory, spatial perception, language, attention, emotion, nonverbal cues, and decision-making (Jensen, 1998).
The media will continue to lie, we can't change that as it is in the nature of the beast. We can not save lost souls and it would be a waste of time to try. When the multi-cultural Hell they have helped create implodes, as it unquestionably will, they, the media, will be the last believers, staggering through the smoking ruins clutching microphones and croaking “Diversity is our strength!” through melting mascara, as everything collapses around them.

Ever since I can remember, I've shopped in second hand clothing stores. Call them what you will – op shops (Australian slang for the opportunity inherent in any second hand store experience), charity shops (I often feel its ME being given charity in the form of amazing finds but whose counting?), thrift shops or jumbles (because the best ones always are a bit of a mess aren’t they?) – they have always been my go to place for something different (and cheap!). In the last 5 or so years the vintage market has completely exploded, with everyone getting amongst it – not least high street stores like Topshop and Urban Outfitters. But for me, the thrill of vintage is still in picking an amazing item out of a heap on the floor, and scoring it at a tiny price. To do this, you have to know when, where and how to look.

The historic links between the UK and the region have meant that the Gulf monarchies have often been particularly attracted to funding new buildings in UK universities (often centres for Islamic or Middle Eastern studies or libraries), the endowment of chairs and postgraduate scholarships.

“Pairing spirits and wine with food is bogus,” Rowley claims. “It seems contrived (and) so subjective to personal tastes. Do you honestly believe you have the same palate of the chef or sommelier?”This comes off as a touch more arrogant than I intended. In fact, I didn't mean to sound arrogant at all; I was shooting for a commonsense approach to drinking with meals, one that eschewed rigid pairings of wine, beer, or spirits with specific foods and only those foods. The quote above should more properly read:

A few years ago, I read numerous articles about Budd Boetticher, a director of some long-unseen Westerns from the 1950s who was being cited as an inspiration by folks like Clint Eastwood and Quentin Tarantino. Boetticher had quite a reputation – he was a maverick, a star athlete whose first love was bullfighting, and spent many years away from Hollywood just to make a movie about his favourite bullfighter.

What emerges clearly too from the performance under Baldur Brönnimann is the sheer beauty of so much of Adams's score, with its dark-hued sonorities, chromatically inflected harmonies and keening instrumental lines. The great choruses that provide the opera's structural pillars are superbly sung by the ENO Chorus, though it's a real shame that the ravishing one that opens the second act has been cut here. All of the solo roles are taken memorably too, whether it's the cameos from Kathryn Harries as the Austrian woman, Lucy Schaufer as the Swiss grandmother, and Kate Miller-Heidke as the British dancing girl, or the major contributions from Christopher Magiera as the Captain, Richard Burkhard as the hijacker Mamoud, Michaela Martens as Marilyn Klinghoffer and especially Alan Opie as Leon Klinghoffer himself, who sings his final number, the Aria of the Falling Body, which Adams calls a gymnopédie, with devastating simplicity.

Here are all the deets for Gabriella's very first birthday party. As I mentioned before, we decided to go with a bee theme because... uh... I like the color yellow. Haha seriously! I'd seen some really cute cupcake toppers from TomKat Studio on etsy, and an adorable yellow pettiskirt from Dreamspun Kids, also on etsy, and I just knew this was what I wanted to do for her 1st. I wanted to keep within the color palette of yellows and white and keep the theme relatively light, with some small touches of black to avoid it looking too dark/tacky. I mean, this is a little girl's party after all!
and of course...you know what is coming next.

BridgePort Brewing Co. is inviting the community to make hay and come to the brewery on May 3, First Thursday, from 6 to 9 p.m. to celebrate the launch of Haymaker Extra Pale Ale. Admission to the event is free.

Inspired by the pure, time-honored stylings of The Stanley Brothers, Josh Cole's heart-of-gold voice and the group's hard driving instrumentation are a perfect fit to celebrate the release of Haymaker.

“Published scientific studies on the Russian heat wave indicate this claim to be false. Our own study on the Texas heat wave and drought, submitted today to Journal of Climate, likewise shows that that event was not caused by human-induced climate change. These are not de novo events, but upon scientific scrutiny,one finds both the Russian and Texas extreme events to be part of the physics of what has driven variability in those regions over the past century. Not to say that climate change didn’t contribute to the those cases, but their intensity owes to natural, not human, causes.”

Negatives: Because of their single-mindedness, Persistents often become consumed by their desire. Everything else is peripheral: career, relationships, morals. They are so focused on the goal that everything else falls to the wayside. Persistents are often stubborn to a fault, refusing to give up even when the pursuit of their goal becomes destructive. They don't heed the advice of others, and sacrifice common sense for obsession. Though the goal may be noble, a Persistent's way of pursuing if is often less than honorable.

I mentioned in my last post that I’ve found a happy home in two different critique communities. In both, I’ve found people with great advice, and those with different perspectives than my own — exactly what I went out searching for. But now that I’m subjecting my writing to the critical eyes of many other writers, I’ve been bombarded with the “rules” that I haven’t thought about in a long time.
One of the interesting stories going around currently goes back to earlier this month when the state hosted its annual emergency management conference in San Antonio. It was during the conference that tornados pounded the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

I was further inspired by the Halloween and Fall word blocks and decided to make my own.

Then I cut the vinyl letters out with my Silhouette using Howser for the Halloween words and Wish I Was Taller for the fall words. Both fonts are wonderful frees fonts from Amanda's Free Scrapbooking Fonts. I also used a few shapes from the Silhouette site: Echo Park Halloween Shapes (echo_park_halloween_shapes_C00245_48353) and Leaf Silhouettes (leaf_silhouettes_C00060_30551). I think the blocks turned out great - love how they look!

From her earliest days, the Church has understood the words of consecration as part of her praying together with Jesus; as a central part of the praise filled with thanksgiving through which the fruit of the earth and of men’s hands are given to us anew by God in the form of Jesus’ Body and Blood, as God’s gift of Himself in His Son’s self-emptying love (cf. Jesus of Nazareth, II, pg. 128). In participating in the Eucharist, in nourishing ourselves on the Flesh and Blood of the Son of God, we unite our prayer to that of the paschal Lamb on His last night, so that our lives might not be lost, despite our weakness and infidelity, but might be transformed."

Being with such a person is like being tied down into a primitive era during which time they actually did have barns and cows grazing! It’s a complete downer.

How to use - After putting on your foundation, apply the pencil gently and directly underneath your eye. Wherever there’s discoloration, apply that pencil girl! Take your ring finger (since it has the least amount of pressure) and pat the product until it is blended out. Never rub your corrector or concealer because you want the product to be concentrated in that area, thus having more coverage. That’s what we’re after right? After applying the pencil, use your favorite concealer. I recommend using a concealer slightly lighter than your foundation because you want the underneath of your eyes to be bright. How do you think Kim Kardashian gets that amazing glow and lifted cheek bone effect?

7. Ted (July 13) – Though I’m sure people certainly exist out there, I’ve never really heard anyone ever utter the words, “I hate Family Guy!” Even my dad loves Peter, Lois, Stevie, Meg, and the rest of the gang! I mention this because the love for Family Guy already proves that comedic mastermind Seth MacFarlane not only has a following but that he also knows how to bring on the raunchy, R-rated funniness. This summer, MacFarlane steps behind the camera for his first feature film, and if the red-band trailer is any indication, it looks like Ted will be a gut-busting good time. Starring Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis, the film is about a vulgar, immature stuffed animal bear who can talk (voiced by MacFarlane) and who gets in the way of the romance between his owner (Wahlberg) and his owner’s new love (Kunis). I’m not a huge fan of talking inanimate objects/animals, but if anyone can pull it off it’s MacFarlane, just look at Brian on Family Guy!

Gee. So Karen Crouse had the unmitigated gall to point out that the sponsoring organization of a major event on her beat is run by a bunch of Neanderthals. Until fairly recently, publicly remarking on such a fact was considered “journalism.” It was also considered “holding the powerful accountable,” “refusing to truckle to sexist shitheads” and “introducing a desperately needed note of reality into an industry and a national conversation that has grown lethally surreal,” among other things.

happy winter solistice, friends! it is around 55 degrees in the state of Kentucky right now. needless to say, it does NOT feel like the winter solstice. this time last year we were enveloped in a white, wintry goodness and this year, we’ve been plagued with rain and mild temperatures. i cannot complain, though. these mild temps got me out into the streets and running again, which was exactly what i needed to boost my personal morale and self-esteem. i was struggling a bit for awhile, but i’d like to think that i am officially on the track to get better mentally, physically, and emotionally. it has been a rough couple of months for me and exercise and fitness has taken a backburner. but, starting today, i am going to move forward toward my goals and get back on track to becoming healthier.

The new proposed Chair, although financially attractive, is a nakedly political post having nothing to do with academia. Nor is the Sussex Chair the first. In an article on the activities of a particularly virulent Zionist specimen of an academic, one Rossman-Benjamin, who spent her time trying to stop Israeli academic and Exeter University Professor Ilan Pappe from touring University of California campuses, I noted that Yale University had closed down a similar programme the ‘Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Antisemitism’ last year.
Whilst Delirium had a very romantic feel to it Pandemonium is more of a survival story with more action. This was a nice improvement for me as despite loving Delirium I did find it a little slow at times but Lauren Oliver really picks up the pace with this book.
Please don’t be so hard on yourself and in just a little while longer, you’ll start to realize, that if anything - you’re an individual. You may well be unknowingly intellectual, but sometimes you should really sit back and realize that intellect comes from the little silly things as well - like funny cats on YouTube and banana skins on pavements.

A beautiful day, we had lunch on the way
After looking at smaller variations of the Clapotis, I tried the Augustine, which is a triangular shawl, not a stole. It has a nice way of slipping two stitches in order to flatten the edges, but several repeats in I still wasn't reading the pattern and couldn't see whether I was on line 1 or 3 of the 4-row pattern.
Sometimes I’m not able to incorporate this in every area. And like I said, sometimes paying more for something works out better in the end. Food that hasn’t been factory-farmed, for example, tends to cost more than the stuff that has been, and so I’m often willing to pay a little more for something that fits my ethics. If I know I need a specific thing that I won’t be able to get at a thrift store, then I have no qualms about paying full price for it.
Why is it that in 2012, we are fighting a war that I thought the suffragettes won 100 years ago? Women deserve affordable and safe healthcare. They deserve the opportunity to have access to things that will help them live healthier lives. As much as people don’t want to seem to admit it, that’s part of the whole “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” thing too.

We learned here that so many parents had no copies of anything that when a storm destroyed a major storage area, it took over a year to re-evaluate, re-IEP and get those students back on track. Those of us who had our copies at home and protected got back on track immediately (or as soon as a school was available for our children).
The suicide car bomb that exploded near Jalalabad road — one of the main thoroughfares out of the city — was among the first blasts in Wednesday’s attack, said Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi. A station wagon that was driving past was caught up in the explosion and four people inside were killed, Sediqi said. A passer-by and a Nepalese security guard were also killed, said Kabul Deputy Police Chief Daoud Amin. The seventh death was not identified.
“Stay here.” Reilly left him standing there and headed to the kitchen. Jacobs stayed there for about two minutes before following after him.
I love hair. I’m sure that all of you agree with me. It doesn’t matter if it’s long or short, straight or curly, blond, black, or any shade in between. There’s nothing like the feeling of running your fingers through someones hair, or that fresh clean smell of shampoo and conditioner.
to thank you!!!!

Adjust Colors - This is another tool that can be extremely useful for minor adjustments, but which should be used with caution. Remember that everyone's computer monitor (including yours) sees color slightly differently, so be careful in making adjustments. The safest way I've found to use this tool it to use the photo's background as your focus. Make minor adjustments until the background is the color it should be, then look at your jewelry and see if it looks better too. If not, discard your changes.
“Massive in every way, B-Craft delivers a complex bundle of flavors with a citrus hop aroma strong enough to make a billy goat shake his head. Moving past the huge hop aroma, rich and roasted malt flavors of chocolate and coffee move forward only to be checked by an impressive hop bitterness. Texture and flavor dance together so seamlessly that you may need to remind yourself that while this beer slides down like a session, it delivers like an assassin!”
“I don’t like this game,“ she cried.

Yep...It's official. Josh was right. I'm bat shit crazy.... It's like when you finally acknowledge that you have a problem (usually after you hit rock bottom). For me, it was this weekend. This weekend, I had to face reality: I'm one of those crazy dog people. I'm literally that person. I'm that freak you see walking around in public with dog hair on their shirts, but they don't seem to notice. The lady who buys the furminator and who lobbied for over 15 minutes in REI that we needed to buy the little boots for the dog before the camping trip because he'd be walking over rocks and stuff (WHAT!? I stand behind that one!!! That shit hurts your feet!!!) (Don't panic. I lost that one. We are a dog-bootieless family.)

Caught the first boat in the morning over to koh Tao and headed back to View Rock for a few days of diving and relaxing. The owners laughed when they saw us, as it was our third time returning in less than a month (highly recommend). We spent some quality time with our favorite Thai watch dog, Durian and managed to fit in 4 dives! The first was filled with mean old triggerfish, but the third one was amazing! We went out to Chumphorn pinnacle where there are millions of fishies everywhere! We saw some groupers almost as big as we were and some teensy tiny
The world encourages us to be extroverts. The school system rewards extroverts who work well in groups, share and easily bond with others. Introverts often grow up feeling that there is something wrong with them and they quickly learn to become extroverts. There is an attitude that introversion needs to be cured not valued in our world. Our preference to enjoying the internal world (introverts) or external world (extroverts) is fixed and we can learn to act outside our preference, but we can’t be forced to leave it without feeling overwhelmed, lost and knocked off centre. Some of us fall in the middle ground of both, but regardless the world is a healthier place when both types are allowed to operate in their comfort
Like many communities across this great nation, the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo tribe has recognized that they simply don’t have unlimited resources that can be used in response to a disaster. Again, like many communities, this lesson was learned from incidents like the floods of 2006 where 300+ homes were lost, a hard freeze in February 2011 when pipes burst throughout the community, and dust storms that occur three or four times a year. It’s also influenced by a large entertainment complex that the tribe operates. During big events ingress and egress on the few local roads is of great concern due to heavy congestion. As such, the tribal leaders have provided a directive that at least one member from every household on the reservation complete the CERT training curriculum.
June and July have been busy months. I have several catch-up blog posts to write in the next few weeks so watch for them, but for today I want to share about our last few days which took us to the small mountain town of Samaipata for some much needed family time. So many people have recommended Samaipata to us and now we understand.
Again, as you become present fully in this feeling, check your locket… are colors appearing on your right side? If not, double-check that you have not snuck in some details… the mind can be tricky like that, until it is well-trained, and May is your last training ground, use it wisely.)

Because, let’s be honest, you ate a bag of skittles to rid you of that mid afternoon, I hate my job, I shouldn’t have had wine on a school night, lull – and for about thirty minutes you resembled something from 24 hour party people, but quite quickly..you feel rubbish again, and you feel guilty for eating the skittles…the whole family sharing size bag.
When releasing a game its finish date and release date timing demands made by consumers while influential does not and should not determine when or if a game is released. In Mothers case Nintendo had to make the difficult decision to forgo the launch of Mother. Why? Because the launch would have not only failed miserably but it could have adversely effected SNES hardware and launch window software sales. So lets look at these two major problems.

Here's a guide to the point system.
One of the great things about LA is its cultural diversity. It may be more of a proverbial salad than a melting pot, but those interested will find an abundance of ethnicities to explore, often conveniently concentrated in neighborhoods that offer keys in form of good eats, and cultural festivals and celebrations - such as Thai Town, and their Songkran (New Year) celebrations held this past weekend.
Joel then decides to team her up with Cheryl as an experiment and the two women are instructed to write a song for bubblegum pop singer Kelly Porter (Bridget Fonda channeling Leslie Gore). Initially, they don’t know what to write about but after being privy to a secret part of Kelly’s personal life they figure it out. Cheryl and Denise bond over the Porter song, become close friends, and generate a hit. After years of writing songs for other people, Joel reminds Denise that she started working for him to create her own music and sets her up with Jay Phillips (Matt Dillon), a brilliant yet temperamental musician from the West Coast, to produce her single. It is at this point that Grace of My Heart shifts from songwriters working in the Brill Building to the experimental West Coast psychedelic scene and some momentum is lost. It may be that Jay and his world is just not as fascinating as Joel and his. It also doesn’t help that John Turturro’s performance is so strong and memorable, while Matt Dillon seems miscast as the mercurial Brian Wilson-esque Jay.

I did eventually leave that job but not after learning this valuable lesson. For a while there my goal was to be a positive influence on others at the same job to pass on what I had learned from my co workers. I learned that it did me no good to go in and be negative because either way I still had to do my job. I still had to talk to everyone and perform my job duties so why not put a smile on my face while doing it.

CAF has a lot of money and announced it would appeal again to a higher court. That is a serious undertaking requiring a lot of resolve and a lot more money. At this point you have to ask, why? Is a point to be made here? Would money going to lawyers be better spent on av gas?
The effort could all be wasted, however, by another No vote on Lisbon. A somewhat similar situation occurred in 2001, when the Nice Treaty referendum – essential for the major enlargement of the EU – was unexpectedly defeated in a very low turnout (34%). .The issue was put again and carried comfortably by 63% to 37% the following year, based on some assurances and guarantees given to Ireland by her partners. However, ominously, the number voting No actually increased second time around.
Despite this anxiety that I can't quite pinpoint, I'm going to do my best to go on the road trip. It's just so, unfamiliar, I think. Something. I'll figure it out.
The entire controversy is based on one review by Andrew Roberts in The Wall Street Journal in which the reviewer drew his own inference that the author of the Great Soul had described Gandhi as a ‘racist’ and a ‘bi-sexual’.

So after the dinner and a couple pints of "Scottish heavy", which I'm tempted to say is one of the better beers in the world, we get ready to leave.
Yesterday, I had a great day in Atlanta. I went to Ikea for the first time and I am in love with that store. I could have spent the entire day in there. We also had a great lunch at the Cheesecake Factory. Now, I'm off to do my taxes. Ugh! I know it has to get done but I hate doing them. Have a good day!

Yes, I’m fully aware that it’s still April, but I thought I would get a jump-start on May’s goals. Given how last month went, I’m going to need all the time I can get. I went 0 for 4 last month, which is just stellar. I’m hoping to at least go 1 for 4 this month. Freeze frame air kick! If you don’t watch New Girl you won’t get that joke. Any who, onto the goals.

I must’ve been was in first grade when I first spoke to him, my sister had just been born and I was dressing up to go to a family portrait. Even at six—I must have been six—I couldn’t miss the first signs of neglect evident in my being left to don my Sunday best by myself. My mirror was no help at that time, the boy in it was in jeans and a t-shirt, rubbing teary eyes with fists.

So last month I read about the Foodie Pen Pals program from Dena at 40 Fit In The Mitt, and I just knew that I had to sign up! It’s a really fun program started by Lindsay at The Lean Green Bean that matches bloggers and readers across the country get matched and send each other foodie-inspired packages. Now, first let me say this: KUDOS to Lindsay. This is not only the best idea ever, but she does an absolutely fantastic job organizing everything. There will be more about Foodie Pen Pals after my post for anyone interested in participating, but for now…here is my first box reveal!
Problem is that my hubby is on this detail where he goes to bed at 8pm. Which means I have been putting our daughter to bed at 9pm. Which means that she finally goes to sleep at 9:30-10 and by then I’m tired. Did I also mention that she hasnt been napping? Yeah, that too.
Interesting how there is such an uproar about WikiLeaks and Sgt. Manning. As with the Pentagon Papers of the early 70s, sets of documents, incriminating in their content, are portrayed as Top Secret. Hogwash! To reveal a certain mindset, or how the perpetrators conduct a War ( just add the word Crimes to it ) should not in itself be labeled as ‘ State Secrets ‘ . No, as with the 2007 video of the Apache helicopter attack on innocent Iraqi civilians ( including two young children ) by US military personnel……. Truth Is Truth! Yet, the outrage by many of our elected officials ( John McCain comes to mind first ) and the Obama administration is hypocrisy taken to another level.

The entire life and teachings of Christ spoke of humility. So why is it that we see so little of it, even within the church? Our ministries are full of pride. There is bickering and back-biting within our work. All of us think things must be done our way. Our marriages are full of arguing. Divorce rates run just as high within the believers as within the world. Turn your Bible to the Book of James. James 4:1-6 (NASB) “What is the source of quarrels and conflicts among you? Is not the source your pleasures that wage war in your members? You lust and do not have; so you commit murder. You are envious and cannot obtain; so you fight and quarrel. You do not have because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. You adulteresses, do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture speaks to no purpose: "He jealously desires the Spirit which He has made to dwell in us"? But He gives a greater grace. Therefore it says, "GOD IS OPPOSED TO THE PROUD, BUT GIVES GRACE TO THE HUMBLE."
A unique characteristic of mine is that the whites of my eyes are bigger than my pupils. Because of that, my fans nicknamed me, ‘Rich in Eye Whites’. Anyway, if it’s hard for you to distinguish us, just know that the member with a lot of eye whites is D.O.
Four songs were put down in three days with Albini, although only one, the punky, abrasive ‘Chi-Town’ about a girl Ryan was going to marry before the band took off, made the cut. The band hope to return to E.A.R. to complete further sessions for their next record, which will include the as yet unissued remaining tracks. “We didn’t want to break them up really” says Gary, “but release them in one go”.

Ross takes a hit squad to South America, and recruits British Royal Marine Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth), who’s a bad-ass soldier that Ross looks at like he’s a weapon that exists for Ross to point and shoot. They take a run at Bruce but he eludes them for a bit, and then turns into the Hulk and disappears. Blonsky isn’t cool with this, and so Ross arranges for his newest pet to get a dose of the serum that Bruce had been working on that eventually turned him into the Hulk to give him a boost of super strength.

“A bit in the mouth of a horse controls the whole horse. A small rudder on a huge ship in the hands of a skilled captain sets a course in the face of the strongest winds. A word out of your mouth may seem of no account, but it can accomplish nearly anything—or destroy it! It only takes a spark, remember, to set off a forest fire. A careless or wrongly placed word out of your mouth can do that. By our speech we can ruin the world, turn harmony to chaos, throw mud on a reputation, send the whole world up in smoke and go up in smoke with it, smoke right from the pit of hell.” (Message)
A major earthquake hit on a Thursday, the 11th of Shvat 5306 (Jan. 14th, 1546), with a magnitude of 6-6.5. The epicenter was apparently the northern Jordan Valley.
In addition to the new coaches Hitting Coach Dave Magadan and Bullpen Coach Gary Tuck return in their roles. Magadan has been the Sox hitting coach for the past five seasons and obviously offense has not been a problem. The Sox have perennially been one of the top offensive clubs in the league since Magadan has been with the club. Tuck has also been on the Sox coaching staff for five seasons. He is a very popular guy in the clubhouse, he’s got an eccentric personality that plays well with the players. He is also a catching instructor for the organization during spring training.
“We must stand together now, not as mutants, not as members of Helix, but as family. We are the future of this world, and together I believe we can save it from destruction once again. We have less then a year until the prophesied war. I know there are some who are skeptical and unsure of my ability to lead. I know this may be in part because I am the first woman to lead in the history of Helix, and I have not trained with any of you. I would like to give a demonstration, at the council’s convenience of course. Allow me the chance to show you I am strong enough, that I’m ready to lead our people into the new world and into battle.”

The Heir painstakingly taught himself to sing and play, and assembled some local friends and got them a gig in the park last year. One kid didn't show up, so the Heir had to sing all the songs, but they made plenty of noise for just three guys. The audience made them play everything twice. They were in all the local papers. Then the other kids got together without the Heir and decided they didn't want to play the songs my son wanted to play. They wanted to play parts of Aerosmith songs in their mother's basement instead. That was the end of that.
Earlier this year I visited the Nogent town museum and discovered an exhibition - a short history of shopping in the Paris region in the last two centuries. Amongst pictures of 19th century market stalls and 1960s supermarkets, I was struck by one particular photo - a black and white image of a building crushed under the weight of exceptional snowfall.

I did try venison once. I should correct that. I was at a very upscale venue on New Year's Eve once and I had a multi-course wine-pairing dinner. By the time the venison course came around I had drunk a glass of champagne and 3 glasses of wine. I'm not sure I really noticed how the venison tasted. I even ate half the fish course that night.

Heart 2 Hearts challenge this past week was to emboss on your car, that could be heat or dry embossing. I have to share that I actually hate to heat emboss. Yep I said it, I am a lazy stamper. I hate stamping, then pouring the powder on the card, then dusting the powder off, then pulling out the heat gun. Just too much work! The finished product is BEAUTIFUL no doubt about it. But like I said its a lot of work:)
This one is called "Grace Revelation". I apologize for the bad photography - but the painting sold before I could retake pictures (and I was planning on retaking pictures, when we get some sun around here!).

Now that we are nearing the end, I ask for prayers to give me the strength to get through the last leg of this deployment and to help my husband and I have a smooth readjustment period. I am really nervous about him coming home and us being "married" again. I have lived completely alone the last year and know that sharing my space and just getting used to each other again is going to be difficult at times. Thank you and the prayers will be much appreciated. :)

Then Rob made his suggestion. We put it on at 8 PM. The kids had the choice to either watch it or read in bed. Reluctantly, Nate took up a blanket, crossed his arms, and "harumphed" onto his seat. An hour, later, Madelyn had drifted off (which she does regardless of the movie, once it's past 8:30), and Nate was groggy, but we were still watching. I didn't want to stop. It was obviously the influence for all those "get the gang together" movies, like Sneakers and Ocean's Eleven and, oh, that Bruce Willis/Ben Affleck one about saving the world from a meteor. The A-Team, my favorite show as an eight year old, was modeled after it.

“Take a look across the hall Ron” he said “This morning at tea all ten of my PHD students stood in a huddle chatting amongst and about themselves.

I have learned to articulately relay absolute information, that is well received. Me, who used to be too shy to raise her hand in class? Me, who shied away from any spotlight attention? Amazingly enough, I learned a very important lesson that was a wonderful tool for me, more recently, back when I "aced" my Speech class, in college. That bit of information, that belied my cold hands, sweaty palms, and jello-like solar plexus, was the fact that anyone can "fake it till they make it". Though I was eaten up with nervous tension, during my speech, when I viewed the film that was made of me, I appeared to be more confident than any of the other ones that had given their speeches. There wasn't a sign of my nervous stomach, no sign of my sweaty palms, not even a sign of my nervousness, in my voice, which astonished me more than anything. There I was, 25 years ago or so, preparing for the day when I would become this tour guide. What a wonderful thing to have learned. I could be nervous, and no one had to know, but myself. I even used very good hand gestures, I was told, which comes quite naturally, to me, it seems.
Then today, I was at the gym and as I was leaving, some teenagers were pointing to sign that said, Please refrain from… and they were saying refrain, refrain, please refrain. So I started to think about the word. Refrain means to hold oneself back and also is a line or lines that is repeated in a verse or song. It’s like a conspiracy. I love singing!

I entered Grand Canyon National Park from the east entrance at Cameron, AZ. A few miles into the park is a pull off for the first view of the mighty canyon from the South Rim. The long drive down from Utah to meet friends for a rim to rim to rim run had me arriving at the first view at sunset worn from two weeks of bouldering, nine hours of driving and a lot of thinking. I parked at the paved pull off, hopped over the rock wall and took in the power and grandeur of the Grand Canyon and the mighty Colorado below. I felt a surge of power and excitement for the run but I knew it was not my time, yet. I was glad to be there to support some friends whose time was now.

Part three is Fripp's own 1979 solo album Exposure. This monster is essential in any progger dork's library. Featuring Hall and Gabriel on vocals (PG's version of Here Comes The Flood on here is absolutely fucking beautiful) as well as Van Der Graaf Generator's Peter Hamill. I've included the original demos too. Lucky you! Sonically brutal and gorgeous at the same time, Exposure has some songs that could be found on the previous albums of the trilogy but with "improved" production and performance.

Paul checks Nataliefor any injuries, and they both get out of the car to see if Brenda survived or not. They see her lifeless corpse floating away on the water, and the scene fades out, as a narrator describes how the storm washed the body down the river, never to be seen again.
No, I discovered as I read further, this was all about short-pouring. Regular visitors to any of Australia’s major sporting arenas will be familiar with the current practice of ‘overflowing’ whereby the spotty 16 year old on work experience passes the beers to you with such lack of grace that rather than presenting nicely with a fine head of foam, the top fifth sloshes out and presents nicely down the front of your shirt. But this is not what thy have been busted for. No, no. Much worse.
“People died, boy,” Pollack growled. “Seven towns without their Stable Rods. We were lucky it wasn’t worse. And you dare make jokes about Coercion?” The law was clear. If a criminal could prove he’d been the victim of Coercion by a Child of the Wild, he was exonerated. A victim in truth.
For proofing: in a plastic container, measure out 7/8 cups of warm water. Add 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 teaspoon of yeast. Lightly cover with a lid and wait for 5-10 minutes until there is a beige foam floating above the water. If this foam is not there, dump out the water and start over: either the water is too hot and killed the yeast, or your yeast has expired. Only proceed once you have seen the foam.
Probes are known only to the investigators, the test-maker, and the perpetrator. If the brain activity shows recognition of relevant stimuli-a distinct spike called a MERMER (memory and encoding related multifaceted electroencephalographic response) – then the subject has a record of the crime stored in his or her brain. Innocent people will display no such response to crime-relevant stimuli. To strengthen the results, Farwell might test the suspect’s alibi for the time of the crime, by devising a scenario to test to see if the brain has a record.
"The aim," Inaba writes in a short essay about the project, "is to produce a distraction from waiting by introducing a mix of people, activity and stimulation to thwart the inward feeling of inertia that is triggered by delays."

Viktor describes himself as a happy and sporty guy! He loves to play floorball (land hockey but played indoors), soccer, golf and ice hockey. Viktor is particularly interested in the American school spirit and school sports; in Sweden they must join sports teams that are separated from the schools. Viktor has a great source of information about what to expect while on exchange here as his sister was here last year. His family are his parents, older sister and eldest brother and they enjoy typical family activities like dinner together, golf and travel together. Besides sports with his friends you may also find him playing piano for a leisure activity. Viktor plans to attend college after high school and his favorite subjects currently are social studies and languages, he has studied Spanish and a bit of French as well. As you consider sports-oriented Viktor to join your family, he would like to tell you, “I’m really excited getting to know you and become a member of your family! Thank you for inviting me to your home!”

I never heard of hummus until I started going to Jon's family's functions. It doesn't make a very good first impression, does it? Sitting there all gloppy and brown? For a long time I swerved right around it on my way to the kugel. Over the years I've become a more adventurous eater, though, and have found that hummus, well made, is delicious. Good with little triangles of pita bread, as Jon's family serves it, or on chips. Even better spread on your favorite sandwich. (Well, maybe not if your favorite sandwich is a fluffenutter.)
In his now-famous Standford graduation speech, Steve Jobs talked about looking back through your life and seeing how all the dots connected to get you where you are today.

Nkandla is a town in the uThungulu district of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. It is the seat of the Nkandla Local Municipality and the hometown of SA president Jacob Zuma. The Nkandla region encompasses nearly 160,000 inhabitants, spread relatively sparsely over a large area with a very high average annual rainfall. Poverty is prevalent, with over 90% unemployment. It has the highest rate of HIV infections with statistics stating 1 in 4, but it is closer to 1 in 3. There are also many orphans due to the AIDS epidemic killing many middle-aged parents.

The mechanism for gun rights destruction was the Firearms Control Act (FCA), passed in 2000 by the South African Parliament. The key force behind the bill was Gun Free South Africa, one of the many global gun ban lobbies funded by George Soros.
This is the only time in the interview when Borg speaks like the politician he claims not to be. ‘When I look at other politicians I tend to see myself more as an economist,’ he says. This is true in that he is appointed, not elected, and was chief economist for SEB bank. But before this, he was a young libertarian longing to turn the world upside-down. Internet footage still exists of a denim-clad Borg declaring on television that if he was prime minister he ‘wouldn’t do a damn thing, so the people could do whatever they want’. When he later became a prime ministerial adviser, he caused a stir when it emerged that a government staffer backed drug legalisation.
The LifeFrames program has expanded the involvement of the local community and has increased its funding from outside sources. It is well received by its participants and the leadership of its participating programs. The recommendation is a slight increase from last year’s modest allocation.
And if that weren’t enough, I also walked past an old neighborhood barn. On a grey winter day it often looked a bit forlorn and neglected but today, with spring in its burgeoning stages, it took on a new life sitting on a soft velvet green carpet with fragrant white blossoming trees at its side. It seemed,a bit more stately and proud to be standing in its old spot.

Then one of her clients asks Talon to investigate a possible murder. And when Talon uses the TEV to view the crime, the identity of the killer is unmistakable—it’s him, Talon Avalon. Someone is taking timecasting to a whole new level and using it to frame Talon. And the only way he can prove his innocence is to go off the grid—which even in 2064 is a very dangerous thing to do…

I spent a lot of time with Mae and Pap when I was little. I loved to go to their house. I thought it was kind of cool that they lived in a trailer. I thought the fact that it had an addition to it was pretty neat as well. I thought that the shelving that seperated the living room from the eat in kitchen was "upscale" with all of the little knick knacks that were on the shelves. I actually have the two roosters that sat on those shelves!

This morning I dropped my oldest off at school and left my youngest, who is sick, home with my husband, who is also sick. I stopped by the store to get more cough medicine, then I took a little stroll through the park, by myself, listening to birds sing and feeling the frost bite my fingers.
I should also add Carolyn looked extremely hot that night.
So, does anyone else spend far too much time thinking about this sort of thing, like me? :)
How is my son? He is 21 years old. Depending on how you feel about methadone-- he has three months free of buying illegal drugs. B says that he has absolutely no desire to use. Amen! He struggles with everyday life, of course. He hates his boss, he says. I try to rephrase that way of thinking to be "he is frustrated with his boss". Sometimes, there are people who are given power in their position as a manager-- but they are lousy leaders. Still, my son shows up to work on time. I'm happy to see that. My mother always gave me that desire to be punctual to work-- even early. Because we've been experiencing some heavy rains, that shortens his work day-- thereby reducing his paycheck.

The Pope is telling us that HE IS God! REMEMBER—NEVER WORSHIP A LEADER. IF YOU WORSHIP A LEADER, YOU THEN NO LONGER HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE WHEN YOU HAVE BEEN DECEIVED! On July 21, 1773, Pope Clement XIV "forever annulled and extinguished the Jesuit Order." France, Spain and Portugal had independently come to realize that the Jesuits were meddling in the affairs of the state and were therefore enemies of the government. The Pope's action was a response to pressure applied by the monarchies. King Joseph of Portugal signed a decree "by which the Jesuits were denounced as 'traitors, rebels and enemies to the realm...'" Pope Pius VII in August, 1814, reinstated the Jesuits to all of their former rights and privileges.

My elderly mother has been ill, so I have had to spend more time helping her with shopping and housework.

Then we would sing songs and play games and meet in a small group where my five closest friends and I would talk about school and homework and boys and God (mostly boys).

There are more attacks and more stunning images from Hitchcock, but it is the moment just before the ending that completes the message of this film. Melanie, who has been seriously injured by birds in the attic of the Daniels' home, has to be taken to the hospital by Mitch, who of course, cannot leave behind Cathy or Lydia. As they start to edge away from the garage, we see that Melanie and Lydia are in the back seat, with Melanie, clearly sapped of her strength due to her injuries, leaning against Lydia's shoulder. Hitchcock cuts to Melanie's hand grabbing Lydia's, followed by an approving smile from Lydia, who knows that Melanie trusts her. For Lydia, who doubted the sincerity of Melanie earlier in the film, she knows now that Melanie is a caring person, one who will be right for her son. This is of course, done with only a few fleeting images and it's evident that Hitchcock's early training in silent films paid off handsomely, as with other scenes - most notably the one late in the film where Lydia and Cathy cannot speak as they must endure another bird attack in their home. It's a marvelous scene, once again chilling for what is not said, as the various characters must embrace and feel the touch of another human if they are to survive the randomness of the bird attacks.

In 2003 THE CARDIO 2000 study results were published. The study was looking at fruit and vegetable consumption in relation to heart disease. The study found in favour of fruit and vegetable consumption and concluded that it could reduce the risk of heart disease but signficantly it did not need five portions a day to achieve this. “Consumption of two or more servings a week is associated with a 70% reduction in relative risk” the researchers concluded. And yes, you read that right,“two or more servings a week”.

It has always been a mystery to me to what class of passengers our railway refreshments are offered. By the first and second class they are instinctively associated with indigestion. The third is accustomed to look upon them as expensive luxuries. I am not now alluding to the Farringdon Street terminus establishment, where I only partook of a sandwich and a glass of ale, and which, when regularly organized, will, I hope, prove an exception to the rule. But it is an incontrovertible fact, that at railway stations generally, and at London termini in particular, the 'commissariat department' is disgracefully managed. For a period of some weeks last year I was compelled (as the phrase goes), by circumstances over which I had no control, to lunch at a well-known terminus in this metropolis. No less than six separate rooms are devoted by the proplietor as bars and salles a manger to the accommodation of the public. The rooms are large and commodious, the servants numerous, and the appointments, to all appearance, good; yet the viands exposed for sale on the counter, the quality of the meat supplied for an early dinner, and the attendance of the waiters are, one and all, execrable. If you are inclined to ' feed ' at the bar, you will find nothing but stale pastry, musty ham, and flyblown buns. If you resort to the dining-room, you will be regaled with coarse-grained beef and flavourless mutton, underdone potatoes, and bad butter. The waiter will not approach you until five or ten minutes after you have called him; and when he does come, ten to one he will be munching the fragments of his own repast. The wretched man is always nibbling in sly corners, tossing off remnants of ale surreptitiously when he thinks no one is looking, and, in fact, having no particular or stated time for his 'meals,' partakes of one long and diffused refreshment throughout the day. As for the ladies behind the bar, they appear to have entered into a solemn compact not to wash their hands more than once a week, and to eschew the use of the nailbrush altogether. One damsel is in the habit of using a toilet-pin in a manner for which it was certainly never intended; another appeared to me one morning in the act of mending an old boot; a third, resenting some remarks which were made on the other side of the counter, once dashed half a glass of porter which she was drinking in the offender's face. Add to these peculiarities a. general sulkiness of demeanour, and yon may form some idea what it is to be waited on by these terrestrial Hebes. To give them their due, however, I will say that they all zealously defend the reputation of the establishment. 'The buns was always considered excellent,' - 'We never had no complaints of the pastry before,' - 'These ham sandwiches musty and dear! Well, you was the fust as said so,' and so on. There is one traditional article of food that they persist in tendering, and the bare recollection of which is enough to induce dyspepsia. It is a huge oblong box of half-baked dough, containing dice-shaped nuggets of cold pale meat and pork-fat. This is cut up into slices, revealing a crust of some half an inch in thickness, and is dignified by the name of veal-pie. I regret that I cannot add the name of the maker; but I strongly advise him to submit it, in case of war, to the authorities at the Horse Guards. A few of these destructive agents left by our commissariat within reach of a hungry regiment, would be admirably adapted for disabling the enemy at an hour's notice.

Thus in my opinion, low levels of evidence are not per definition problematic. Even if they are the basis for strong recommendations. As long as it is clear how the recommendations were reached and as long as these are well underpinned (by whatever evidence or motivation). One could see the exposed gaps in evidence as a positive thing as it may highlight the need for clinical research in certain fields.

To paraphrase Tony Stark (because I can’t find the quote on Google), Tom Hiddleston is everything America expects an English villain to be. He a camp, over-the-top diva who is utterly evil and wants nothing more than the downfall of the United States (and, as a result, the world). Surprisingly, this is not a criticism. Loki camps it up as an immortal, power-hungry monster as only an ancient god can. As a man with huge power, a thirst for revenge and (as he sees it) a divine and immutable right to rule the world, there is no other way to play it than scene-chewingly angry. He faces every challenge with a curved lip or victorious smile. I loved every second he was on-screen. Even more so once defeat becomes inevitable.

Look for some bricks of an old building just to the left of the trail near the 2.6-mile point. Shortly after than point, you will see the chassis of an old car rusting in the woods, also to your left. (A sign on the trail points the way, christening the dilapated car as the Bonnie & Clyde Memorial.) The car is worth a look, mainly for its slightly sinsister appearance and the air of mystery about how it got there. There are also some old bricks bearing the imprint of the company that made them scattered about on the ground.
My first trip to New Orleans was full of the expected, classic tourist attractions. Husband was photographing location shots for a client, so his assignment was to capture easily recognizable images of The Big Easy.

In addition to continuing to homeschool our youngest, I work part time at the library and battle daily health issues. Sometimes life is great, and I can do it all. Sometimes not, but still everyone needs to eat! As I was hobbling through the grocery store this weekend, I knew that I probably had another difficult week ahead of me, pain wise. So I shopped with that in mind, and basically just stocked the kitchen with enough meat, veggies and fruits and work with and hoped for the best.

It is the second film directed by Nicholas Stoller, co-writing with star Jason Segel, under the Apatow umbrella; the first was Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which I do not recall liking at the time, though the internet promises me that I did; by this point, all I can really strongly remember is the chalky aftertaste left by which I cannot in good faith call "misogyny", though there's something problematic and dark about the way it conceives of women (it's essentially The Nice Guy Fallacy: The Movie). Which managed to keep my enthusiasm for Engagement tamped down, and it is maybe for that reason that I actually ended up liking the movie quite a lot. Or maybe it's just because for all that Engagement is a movie written by males with a distinctly male perspective, it plays startlingly fair by its female lead, and given how much a healthy chunk of the back hour acts like it really wants to start tossing blame around this way and that, it's practically heroic of Stoller and Segel that they remain so committed to presenting both perspectives of its central couple as being both reasonable and selfish in their own ways (if not, perhaps, equally reasonable and selfish to one another).

I'm nearly at the end of Margaret George's novel, Elizabeth I. As a novelist, George isn't subject to a biographer's rules, but she's also pretty scrupulous about the facts. Everybody walks through these pages—Raleigh, the Cecils, Shakespeare, John Donne. Some of them get into bed with each other. But George doesn't stretch the truth too far—at least for my taste. Her portrait of an aging Elizabeth, prone to all the pains of getting old, is superb. Any time I thought I was having a bad day, I thought, At least I'm not dealing with the Armada. Or Essex. Or Ireland. Or famine. Or Mary Queen of Scots…Visit Mariah Fredericks's website.

In the South Island of New Zealand where I live, at about the same time, our local newspaper – the CO News – ran a story titled “Buddy fills special place in young boys life”. This Buddy programme is where a child, who needs a bit of extra time with an adult, is paired up with someone who has the same interests as them, and has a lovely time.

If this post were a riddle (and believe me, the original iteration was an indecipherable enigma), you might have noted these clues as to the identity of my edible accompaniment. I referred to David Leibovitz's Pesto Recipe as a guide for this simple meal made simply. The resulting dish had just the right flavor for this blog post.
Ran to Chat and the base of the 2nd with Joe. Scrambled the 2nd before continuing to the summit and descending Gman-SR-Amphi and running all the way back to Pearl St. The 1010s were fantastic on the scrambling--surprisingly sticky outsole, almost like some approach shoes. Really solid outing but my ankle was a total liability on tech trail and I actually kinda re-rolled it a bit on Greenman which was really not ideal. Totally fine on smooth trail or pavement but I have zero technical descending ability right now with it. Soaked it in the creek afterwards for 10min; yesterday was definitely the worst I've ever rolled an ankle.
This is a hard thing to learn. As parents, we tend to take every "misbehavior" personally. They don't like the sandwich we made, and we're offended. They melt down in the store, and you wonder if it's because you weren't firm enough with them when they were nine months old. It's not about you. If you were firm his whole life until this point, he'd still have to go through being three. If you were gentle and carefree up until now, he will still have to go through being three. There's no way to avoid it, and it's not about you. It's about your child, going through a difficult transition. It's about the baby body breaking down to grow into a little person. It's about the brain going crazy as it makes new connections in order to learn more. So, don't make this harder by taking it personally. Because it's not about you. It's about helping the child transition into his new role.

In these five selections, Chekhov addresses many of the highest themes of literature: the state of the mind (“The Black Monk”); the value of art (“The House with the Mezzanine”); the unending cycle of poverty (“The Peasants”); the corrupting influence of wealth (“Gooseberries”); and the mystery of love (“The Lady with the Toy Dog”). In these stories, Chekhov asks no less than what it means to be human. He doesn’t offer easy answers; often his stories end with the question unresolved. But it is impossible after reading them not to feel moved by the power of Chekhov’s words.

In 48.4% of villages, Dalits are still denied access to common water sources. In 35.8%, they are denied entry into village shops. They are supposed to wait at some distance from the shop, the shopkeepers keep the goods they bought on the ground, and accept their money similarly without direct contact. In teashops, again in about one-third of the villages, Dalits are denied seating and are required to use separate cups. In as many as 73% of the villages, they are not permitted to enter non-Dalit homes, and in 70% of villages non-Dalits do not eat together with Dalits.
Next go in the spices. Add the chili powder, oregano, cumin and generous amount of salt. Stir well to "toast" the seasonings. Add the tomato paste, and again stir in well. You want to actually get "color" on the tomato paste developing flavor. Stay on a medium heat, you want color, not burn. At this point you want to deglaze the skillet. That means add a liquid to pull up the brown bits that are starting to stick to you pot. Traditionally you'd use a beer, but I grabbed apple cider vinegar instead.

20th Century Design History was a subject I really enjoyed over Summer School. It was my first dedicated history unit, and Im not sure whether this was because it allowed me to roll out my penchant for literary debate (the subject was delivered online) or because we got to explore some topics close to my heart including Modernism, Art Deco, and the blight of post-war 1950s suburbia. In particular I was introduced to The Australian Ugliness (Robin Boyd) which Ive now read twice since the term started on January 4th – GREAT book, so much so for its analysis of Australian design, but also the Australian psyche and cultural tendencies of a new nation. Even if you dont have an interest in architecture, it is a must read for his dry wit and acute observations of how erm, ‘unusual’ we are
After looking at the bizarre wedding ring for several seconds, the new Mrs. Jack Carter stuck out her left hand as if she had just discovered an engorged tick implanted on her finger. In a panic, she began rapidly stamping her feet up and down to the point they had become a blur making her look like she was trying to run a one-hundred yard dash in his house. Jack was increasingly dumbfounded and worried as her eyes became huge and her breathing became panicky, so much that the sheet she had carefully wrapped around herself came loose and fell to the floor without her noticing.
The unbelievers of the world have no access to divine insight. Oh, they may pray, calling upon God but who is their god? Who is the god of this world? Who is the god of the unbeliever?

Avoidant The behavior of avoidant types can often be difficult to predict. Deep down they do crave intimacy, but they often think this connection will rob them of their prized independence. People in this category may feel uncomfortable or suffocated if they sense love interests getting too close. Often this leads them to pull away.
Lastly the exhaust position is also controlled by ensuring no bodywork sits in the tail pipes wake. To measure this, an imaginary cone (diverging at 3 degrees) in line with the pipe, reaching as far back as the rear axle line must be drawn. This cone (drawn red in the illustrations) must not touch any bodywork, nor must bodywork be placed over the cone. With a typical F1 car the only bodywork in the regions behind the tailpipe are the rear wing endplates, the front portion of rear brake ducts and any central top bodywork (i.e. Red Bulls bulged central cooling exit).

11. Now it's time to pin. If you want to machine quilt your quilt then pinning is the best and easiest way. You can use a basting spray but I am wary of using them with little people around or when I'm pregnant. Which seems to be most of the time. They are pretty toxic and I don't have a garage or suitable space outdoors to spray in. So I like to use large quilting safety pins and pin every few inches.

If you look at medicine, they get medicaid for 8 months, that’s it. After that they’re expected to take care of their own medical needs, meaning mom or dad better have a job with good health insurance or they could be really hurting. One major health-related issue faced by many refugees is managing their weight. They aren’t used to our foods and most of the food they can afford (McDonalds, frozen dinners, etc.) is very, very unhealthy. I knew one refugee at the mission who had gained 40 pounds since arriving in the states. But they can’t afford to buy lots of healthy foods either because those foods are very expensive.

The final speaker was Manny Dominguez, who highlighted the savage cuts being made by the Labour-run Leeds City Council, and how it affects the service he works in. He went on to explain how a fightback is brewing amongst UNISON members and how the recent pensions dispute, despite being sold out by UNISON’s right-wing leadership, has helped galvanise members for further struggles. The discussion was wide ranging from discussing the environment to where funds could come from to provide decent public services for all.
Again, if I were a soldier and saw in the field a priests’ banner, or banner of the cross, even though it were a crucifix I should run as though the devil were chasing me; and even if they won a victory, by God’s decree, I should not take any part in the booty or the rejoicing. Even the wicked iron-eater, Pope Julius, who was half devil, did not succeed, but had to call at last on the Emperor Maximilian and let him take charge of the game, despite the fact that Julius had more money, arms, and people. I think, too, that this latest pope, Clement, whom people held almost a god of war, succeeded well with his fighting until he lost Rome and all its wealth to a few ill-armed soldiers. The conclusion is this: Christ will teach them to understand my article, that Christians shall not make war, and the condemned article must take its revenge, for it is said of Christians and will be uncondemned and right and true; although they do not care and do not believe it, but rush on more and more, hardened and unrepentant, and go to destruction. To this I say Amen, Amen.

So understood, such an alleged presumption is clearly mistaken. For the assertion that “There is no God” is just as much a claim to knowledge as is the assertion that “There is a God.” Therefore, the former assertion requires justification just as the latter does. It is the agnostic who makes no knowledge claim at all with respect to God’s existence. He confesses that he doesn’t know whether there is a God or whether there is no God.

Literally, South Korean Fisheries agents, Japanese Coast Guard , and Chinese fishermen are dying because of the “relevant circumstances”. There doesn’t seem to be any interpretations of “equity” all three states can accept (here’s one, for what it’s worth). If Japan and South Korea could see their way to drop their Sea of Japan dispute, and could agree upon an interpretation of “equity” each could live and prosper with, together both might just be able to convince a majority of states to oppose China. Not only would both Japan and South Korea gain unchallenged rights to a maritime zone – Korea in the Sea of Japan; Japan in the East China Sea – but they would also help other states end their disputes.

Gold, eh? Yep. Gold! The film opens with a guy poking around inside a cave located in what I assume is Akasava. Wearing one of them silver fireproof suits and wielding a portable geiger counter, he comes across this weird chunk of rock, one that makes his portable gadget go haywire. As he's removing the shiny stone–which he has since placed in a silver briefcase–from the cave, he's shot by an unknown assailant. Staggering to his car, his chauffeur manages to get the wounded spelunker and the magic stone back to the professor's lab. Since the professor, the esteemed Professor Forrester, doesn't know anything about treating gunshot wounds, he's a mineralogist, not a doctor, he travels to see his doctor friends, Dr. Thorrsen (Horst Tappert) and Dr. Ingrid Thorrsen (Ewa Strömberg), to ask them to help his bleeding assistant.

﻿Having seen so much of the changes that have occurred in the last couple of years, and especially just recently, I thought I would give you some heads up on why the Mortgage Underwriter and Processor keep asking for more documentation. It seems like a mountain of information that is needed to get a loan to approval these days and we all know why. Let me remind you, yet again, though it seems excessive, it is necessary to fully implement due diligence and determine whether someone really does qualify for a loan. The underwriter usually gets blamed for declining a loan, regardless of what the issues are and just recently something was written online about Real Estate Agencies requesting less strict underwriting guidelines. After all we have been through as a Nation, let alone the many homeowners who could face never owning another home, how could anyone request something like this?
