Will that be particularly difficult for SANAA, known for its use of glass? Will Johnston Marklee, known chiefly for its rough glamour, be able to groove to the Menil's minimalism without losing its edge? Will Tatiana Bilbao win her big, breakthrough commission?

"The Avengers" success and eventual video game tie-in got me thinking about film to console crossovers that have actually been a success. The first one that comes to mind was 1993’s “Aladdin” for the SEGA Genesis. Not only did the game capitalize on a wildly successful movie, but managed to do so with deft execution. The animation had the look and feel of a big-budget, controllable Disney film, along with the familiar and lovable music. While at its core it’s your bog standard side-scroller, “Aladdin” provides depth and challenge to a world that was only able to be hinted at in a fast-paced 90 minute film.
Jeannette laughed.
A state task force was created; ideas were brainstormed and legislation proposed.

Murkowski spokesman Michael Brumas said, "This is another desperate attempt by an outside group to distract from the merits of the debate. Sen. Murkowski has legitimate concerns about the economic consequences of EPA regulating greenhouse gases and believes the American people deserve a full debate on the issue. It's unfortunate that some extreme groups have to resort to breaking the law to try to quash that debate."
Such collaboration is not a species of fraud. It is a process in which a leader refines his own thoughts, invites suggestions by trusted advisers and welcomes the contributions of literary craft to political communication. A very few presidents -- Lincoln may exhaust the category -- have no need of consultation on policy or style. But political mortals generally benefit from it.

All the good news (low inflation, high employment, rising stock and real estate prices) drove economic growth. Between 1982 and 2007, there were only two mild recessions. When prosperity was jeopardized -- by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the tech crash in 2000, the 9/11 attacks -- the Federal Reserve seemed to defuse the threats. The economy seemed less risky. Economists announced the Great Moderation of business cycles.
"You can order a truckload of bottles and do many different brands with them. But because cans come preprinted, you can only use them for one beer. It costs $37,000 just for a first order of cans. The per-unit cost is less, but you have to buy so many of them."

Missouri senior tight end Michael Egnew is on the preseason watch list for the Mackey Award. The award is given to the top tight end in the nation. Egnew was a finalist for the award last season after leading the nation in receptions by a tight end (90). He totaled 762 yards and five touchdowns on his way to becoming a First-Team All American. The last Tiger to win a Mackey Award was former Missouri tight end Chase Coffman in 2008.
He missed no votes whatsoever in 2010, when the Senate had 299 roll-call votes. That's a perfect record. (If you don't like his positions, you might not find it so perfect, but that's a different argument.)
November 8 & November 28
Houston’s music became as popular as it did because it was a bridge between generations and genres. She could sing with the pop energy of Madonna, or summon the spirit of Barbra Streisand on a showy ballad. This was soul, but it wasn’t raw and gritty; it was modern, but never alienating. Her performances did draw from her gospel upbringing, but sparingly, strategically, just enough to give the song the requisite force, and never enough to upset the apple cart. Houston became the darling of the pop music establishment in the ‘80s — she was showered with awards, and became for millions the exemplar of upright young womanhood.
Meyer's plans for the Balboa include everything from possibly transforming the theater into an "atmospheric," with painted stars twinkling in the ceiling next to restored chandeliers, to hiring a neighborhood teen to wear a tie, open doors for customers and carry a flashlight for the full-on usher experience.

The state awarded too many grants this year because it overestimated student attrition -- the number of grant applicants who would decide not to enroll in the fall or drop out during the winter and spring terms, Dennis Johnson, executive director, told the commission.

Harris has taken a circuitous route to claiming her calling as a musician. Even after finding her muse, life's vicissitudes have occasionally knocked her off stride.

I've been testing the Xbox 360 with a focus on nongaming apps, and it's clear that Microsoft is serious about them. All apps are free to download onto Xbox, though some, like Netflix and MLB.TV, require paid memberships and others, like HBO Go, require an existing cable account with a specific channel or service. Most apps require an Xbox Live Gold account to use, and this costs about $60 a year for one person or $100 a year for a Gold Family Pack that four family members can share.

I loved the somewhat misleadingly named barbecued chicken ($34). The beautifully presented dish created a visual tapestry, with slices of moist meat, a glazed thigh that tasted confited and a "potato salad" that was actually a collection of root vegetables perked up with apple. It was a dish that hit all notes. We also tried the crisp duck breast ($37) arranged with house-made pasta tossed with duck leg ragout. These dishes reminded me of how the kitchen had excelled on previous visits.

The Broncos traded back into the first round of the 2010 draft to pick Tebow, a move that surprised many around the league who had projected Tebow as a second-round pick or lower. Few teams, after watching Tebow's first two years in Denver, would likely want to give back the value the Broncos first spent to get him. That means they could be taking a lower-round draft pick to move Tebow.

We also passed pig hunters, rifles shouldered and dogs in tow. Pigs, another pakeha introduction, have run amok here since Cook released them. In Kafka-esque style, they mutated to three times their English farmyard size, grew savage tusks and now eviscerate the earth, overturning trees and destroying habitat.
Yanwen Xia opines in an April 30 Blog Bit that a dastardly conspiracy occurred in 2009 to obstruct and handicap the new president. Of course, Democrats never lower themselves as to plan (conspire) a strategy to advance their causes. They are too pure and ethical to stoop so low as to plan how to protect their interests.

Another hypothesis says that consumers' inventory management drives the asymmetry. When prices are rising, folks are quick to top off their tanks, so a large number of us are searching for the best deal. When prices are falling, people are more willing to let the needle drop to "E," and when it gets there, they become less price-sensitive.

"To me, being a good manager isn't nearly as much about the technical stuff as it is managing people," says first baseman Lance Berkman. "You can learn one a lot easier than the other. I really believe you could just have players on the bench and the game would largely run itself. Everybody knows about the double switch and when your starting pitcher gets tired. It's the stuff that goes on before and after games that can be critical."

About the teams: Class 5 in Missouri lacked depth at the top this year, evident in Kirkwood's seamless route to the finals. The Pioneers faced unranked Holt and Camdenton in their first two playoff games, then beat No. 10 Hazelwood East in the semifinals. Kirkwood's signature win was 40-21 over No. 4 Parkway Central in Week 5.

Northwestern recruit Mike McHugh has 941 yards on 30 receptions, an impressive 31.4 average. LB Jahmal Hicks, S Edward Richey, DE Antonio Leachman and LB Clayton Burnett lead an athletic defense. ... Staley survived unscathed through perhaps the toughest schedule in the Class 5. Among the Falcons' regular-season victims were Blue Springs, Kearney, Park Hill South and Park Hill, and in the playoffs they've beaten No. 5 Fort Osage (7-6) and No. 2 Lee's Summit West (76-70 in four overtimes). Staley averages 39.2 points and allows 16.9. The Falcons are not an air attack. Mizzou recruit Morgan Steward leads a ground game that averages 8.8 yards per carry.

IPS administrators obviously are still bitter that the state Department of Education decided to take over four of the district's failing schools last year. They've retaliated in ways that not only are petty but also hurt students. For example, members of the Howe High School basketball team were not allowed to work out in the school gym recently because their coach and at least some of the players have decided to stay at Howe after a new operator takes control of the school in July.
Its easy to screw up Americas favorite brunch cocktail  too much pepper, too much Worcestershire sauce, too much Tabasco, too much vodka, any V8  the list of possible transgressions is long. But a good Bloody Mary is a beautiful thing indeed, as comforting as a BLT in a glass, as rousing as a burst of sunshine breaking through a wall of thick fog. Such a one is Blue Grottos San Marzano Bloody Mary, which uses the juices of imported canned San Marzano tomatoes from Italy. Blue Grotto owner John Grier has been making his version of Americas favorite pick-me-up for 20 years, and his lips are sealed as to the precise recipe. The garnishes, of course, are plain to see: lime and three olives. Three cheers for banishing the celery stalk, which too often injects jarring crunching and munching into what should be a genteel sipping experience.
With local and national media on the scene, including camera crews from CNN and "Inside Edition," the first problem officials encountered was that Dekraai's picture "was all over TV before we had a chance on a couple of witnesses to do photo lineups, so that was a concern," Simmons said.

The cap was tangentially part of the conversation about property taxes during the last mayoral campaign, and City Councilman Carl Stokes — himself the recipient of an 84 percent discount on his property taxes due to the homestead credit — is advocating for reform. He proposes increasing the cap on annual tax increases to 10 percent — the maximum allowed under state law — and using the money to reduce the overall tax rate. A city property tax commission created by former Mayor Sheila Dixon suggested the same idea in 2007. But the Rawlings-Blake administration has rejected the idea, saying it wouldn't generate enough money to fund a meaningful drop in the property tax rate and would hurt some longtime city residents who would be priced out of their homes.
Metropolitan Police Commisioner Bernard Hogan-Howe said Tuesday that detectives would conduct voluntary mass DNA screening of MI6 employees.

I've always loved the butterscotch and chocolate pot de creme for dessert (all desserts, $8.50). However, I felt I needed to try something new, so I went for the hazelnut chocolate roulade - it's like a big hunk of frosting accompanied by cherry ripple ice cream.

It's not a point of view or strategy seen very often on competitive reality shows, and Bill and Cathi should be proud of being positive role models throughout the competition. Farewell, Bill and Cathi, it was a pleasure watching you each week. Except maybe during the bikini episode.

Mr. Khullar, the commerce secretary, said he is hopeful India can reduce its trade deficit to $150 billion in the year that began April 1. That depends on global oil prices stabilizing, as India's energy demand shows no sign of letting up.

1. "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" - In his only effort, director Mike Newell delivered the very best "Harry Potter" film by doing everything Curaon did, only with meatier material. With the Tri-Wizard Tournament as the film's backdrop we get a focused plot and the debut (finally!) of Ralph Fiennes vamping it up as the supremely evil Lord Voldemort. The movie climaxes with the series' first major casualty with the zapping of Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson, who would later awake to find himself playing a vampire in significantly worse movies). It is at this point that it becomes clear that the "Harry Potter" saga is playing for keeps and that our little wizards are going to have to grow up - and fast.

"So I don't know if that's going to be a determining factor with the doctors, and the fact that he hasn't played. I can say, yes, he looks good, but again, does he feel good? Do the doctors think it's enough time based on the injury that he's had to get him out on the floor? I can't make that decision."

A roasted chicken entree is simple, too, but effective. There is crispy, herbed skin and thoroughly juicy meat to enjoy, but also a bed of meltingly moist jus-soaked bread stuffing and tenderly roasted, gently seasoned zucchini, eggplant and potatoes. The mushroom gravy judiciously spread over the fork-tender Salisbury steak tastes like it was made in the pan, a rare find these days. A maple-braised pork shank was not as good as its homey accompaniments — Maine Sunday beans, brown bread for sopping and roasted vegetables.

Waipio Valley: A rare spot on the islands that feels much like it must have been like to live in Hawaii 50 or even 100 years ago. This is the kind of place where Hawaiians have always traditionally lived – deep valleys by the sea, often accessible only by boat.

Just like you don't need to be Irish to celebrate St. Patrick's Day, everyone — Mexican or not — can have a ball during Cinco de Mayo. The only requirement is understanding that Cinco de Mayo is not Mexico's independence day, but the anniversary of the Battle of Puebla. In 1862, President Benito Juárez sent a force of poorly equipped Mexicans under Gen. Ignácio Zaragoza to fight a professional French army that had landed at Veracruz to retrieve an $80 million debt. The underdog Mexicans defeated the French on May 5.

Because it seemed to implicate others in the hacking, the email had the potential to blow a hole through News International's fiercely held contention that one reporter alone had engaged in hacking. If James Murdoch knew about the email - and was aware of its implication - it would lend weight to the suggestion he'd approved the payoff in an effort to bury the scandal.

"Traffic is something that you need in this league," Backes said. Dallas goalie Kari Lehtonen "made a lot of good saves that were just shots into his glove. If we put one on the pads or have someone in front of his eyes where he can't see that, maybe he's a little late reacting. Getting bodies to the net is probably half the equation, though.
