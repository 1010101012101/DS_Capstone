In 1961, Borge helped create the Sandinista National Liberation Front, a guerrilla movement that operated from Nicaragua's hills and from exile. It fought the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, who had taken over after his father's slaying.

Surinam cherry (Eugenia uniflora) is a South American native also known as Brazilian cherry, cayenne cherry, Florida cherry or by the exotic moniker, pitanga. The Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council considers Eugenia uniflora a Category I invasive species because it has spread out of control in South Florida. However, in the central and northern parts of the state it doesn't exhibit the same kind of invasive behavior because of its sensitivity to cold temperatures. When the thermometer dips below 30 degrees (as it does most winters), Surinam cherry bushes either suffer or, like the ones in my yard, give up the fight and die.

The recording uses various casts and some of the high-pitched singing sounds helium-induced or unfortunately catlike. “I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,” in particular, sounds a little strange in falsetto. Still, the vocal harmonies are solid and the embellishments entertaining.

Los Angeles became the younger Veeck's field of daydreams. He tried everything and everyone he could think of in the '50s to bring MLB to this coast, having been hired to explore such a move by William Wrigley's son Phil, who owned the L.A. Angels of the minors. Veeck already qualified as a near-pioneer, having integrated the American League in 1947 (with Larry Doby), so not only did he come close to beating Rickey to emancipation, he also came close to beating Walter O'Malley to baseball's virgin territory. Who knows? Chavez Ravine could have ended up with Vin Scully leading the fans in song plus an exploding scoreboard.

Exercise equipment can fall into the Class 2 category if the company claims to do something other than promote general fitness, such as rehabilitating injured joints or speeding weight loss.

Passing this test gives them FDA "clearance," but not approval.

Howard Troxler: The stars lined up perfectly for Marco Rubio with the election of Barack Obama as president and a natural counter-reaction to Obama's policies, especially on health care. Meanwhile, Crist (and the Republican Legislature) had to deal with a catastrophic economy and took the stimulus money; Rubio had the luxury of not having to govern and could blame Crist (but not the Legislature) for taking it, while associating him with all things Obama.

When baked in standard-sized loaf pans, breads and cakes laden with fruits and nuts, often turn out more evenly done when you reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees. Fruitcake is a great example: With its dense batter and abundant dried fruit, a lower oven keeps the outside of the cake from getting too dark while the inside finishes baking. It also keeps the dried fruit on the surface of the cake from shriveling into little bits of carbon. Those in the brownie camp who eschew the hard edge pieces can likewise try baking the batter in a 325-degree oven; you'll still have corner and edge pieces, but they won't be as crispy and dry.

It's admirable to attempt a ghost story that can withstand the cynical skepticism of our time while engaging the reader with characters who struggle with all-too-real dilemmas. Here, Koryta has created a vivid world that's hard to shake for days after the book is finished.

Since the 2001 attacks, the airport screening workforce has been entirely revamped and billions of dollars spent on technology that's been deployed across the country. But despite all the enhancements, there have been lapses. Most recently, a cellphone-size stun gun was found aboard a plane operated by JetBlue Airways Corp. Officials do not believe the stun gun was intended for use in some type of attack, but the FBI is investigating how and why it was on the airplane. And earlier this month, a Nigerian American was accused of breaching three layers of airport security while getting on a cross-country flight with an expired boarding pass.

Looking further than the next election is simply not part of the DNA in Washington, D.C. The term for House members needs to be extended to four years so that serving in the House is not a perpetual bid for re-election. Also, term limits are needed for both the House and Senate, and the token moratorium on members of Congress becoming lobbyists needs to be extended. Is it any wonder that a recent poll put Congress’ approval rating at 14 percent?

"Sam told me his approach shots weren't finding the greens at all," Holtmeier said. "He was kind of frustrated with his play because last year he shot a 68 on the exact same course.

The detective said Perry suffered from low self-esteem resulting from his status as an unemployed man who stayed home and baby-sat while his new girlfriend was working and going to school.
If the idea of giving a soda stealer an equivalent sentence to an armed robber seems offensive, it's nothing compared to what happened to Williams, who embodied the controversy over California's three-strikes law in the mid-1990s. A habitual felon with a long criminal history, he stole a slice of pizza from some kids near the Redondo Beach Pier and, thanks to the newly enacted law, ended up being sentenced to life in prison. Since Williams there have been plenty of other examples of inappropriate sentencing, including convicts given life terms for shoplifting vitamins or golf clubs.

In a portable office behind the palace, the civil engineer appointed by Preval to resolve the land issue, Marie George Salomon, says the plan is to raze the most damaged parts of Fort National and build orderly rows of wood-framed shelters. But the disorganized way in which the neighborhood grew, with narrow alleys and houses on top of houses, means the area held far more people than the rebuilt one ever will.
But while the Blues are gaining puck possession and managing shots, that hasn't translated into an offensive advantage. The club has outshot its first three opponents 106-57, but the goal total of the teams is the same, 9-9. Backes' line, which included Jamie Langenbrunner and Andy McDonald before McDonald's head injury, has not scored in three games.
Last year? No Final Four teams since a bracket I did in sixth grade. (I think I had Princeton winning the whole thing. Ah, youth.) Only four Elite Eight teams. Heck, even Bracket Baby's field was better than mine!
After a year-long wait, residents got to voice their opinions, instead of merely ask questions.
A. Honestly, I found myself usually frustrated with Yogi. I always rooted for the ranger. Either way, when this script came to me, I felt like I was doing something meaningful because it was based on something that was so iconic in my childhood. That's also why I did "Alvin and the Chipmunks."
I can't say I'll be staying glued to my phone.
Opponents such as Geertson point to another problem. When alfalfa fields are rotated with other crops, the traditional method is to wipe it with Roundup before planting. If genetically engineered alfalfa is present, it will survive the spraying and endure as a weed competing with the new crop, Geertson said.
Bloomberg has defended the NYPD, saying last week it doesn't take religion into account in its policing.
Moreover, America would have to reckon with the fact that currently there's no global consensus for a military strike against Iran. Russia and China, Iran's strongest backers, are still smarting from what they consider NATO's overreaching in Libya after they abstained from the Security Council vote authorizing military force to protect civilians there. They are unlikely to sign on to a new round of economic sanctions against Iran, let alone military intervention.

St. Louis is for ... cheapskates? - St. Louis topped a list of the 10 Best Cities for Cheapskates, based on the city's combination of low cost of living, its numerous free attractions, and high concentration of dollar stores. The list, compiled by Kiplingers.com, credited the city's many cultural attractions, such as the St. Louis Zoo, Science Center and Citygarden. "St. Louis isn't a huge city, but if we're counting per capita, it boasts more museums and libraries than any city on our list (and it beats New York and Washington, D.C., by a factor of 25)," the website writes.

Hoyer, who has campaigned and raised money for dozens of Democratic members, has already lined up support across the Democratic spectrum. That means the Hoyer-Murtha race won't be about ideology, even though Hoyer has been less critical of the Iraq war than Murtha.
For her catering business, that means everything from cupcakes shaped like teacups to towers covered in black creepy-crawly garnishes. But nothing has been more popular than wedding cakes -- or rather, wedding cupcakes. Although Kux made her first cupcake tower several years ago, she would never have predicted the recent surge. Now, she's building at least a couple each month.

The 1987 trial was the first of its kind since that of infamous Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in 1961. Broadcast on Israeli radio and television, the proceedings stretched out over 18 months and featured emotional testimony from Holocaust survivors who identified Demjanjuk as Ivan the Terrible. Forensic experts confirmed as genuine the ID card, unearthed in Soviet archives, attesting to his service as a Nazi guard.

Then in January, after Greene's company took control of both stations, he swapped the afternoon drive programs. He moved KSLG's show, hosted by the no-holds-barred Kevin Slaten, to 590 and sent Jeff Gordon, Jeff Vernetti and Brian McKenna to 1380. And Greene threw Ashlee Feldman, a 24-year-old woman who had been on an MTV reality show, on the air with Slaten.

Kudos to Dan Rodricks for his recent column in The Sun ("In anger and pain, little sympathy for the 'deaths of others").

In a positive review with its share of backhanded compliments, Richard Corliss of TIME says, "The new enterprise is just one lavish element in the grand design.

Football is different though. Football is not part of the rational world. Yanda was going to be paid whether he played or not against the Bengals, but he did not wish to look his teammates in the eye and acknowledge he could not contribute when they needed him the most. As foolish as it may sound, that's what I love about the game. Not beautiful touchdown catches, or breath-taking runs. The moment when a man puts himself through hell because he cannot let his teammates down, or let the pain win.

Several commissioners questioned the timing of the ballot initiative, saying it should be geared toward a general election when more voters would be expected to participate and not during the August primary as this attempt would be. Many of the same commissioners also questioned the fate of art in a museum owned by the financially struggling City of Detroit that would, in part, become funded by Macomb County taxpayers. Erickson sought to assure commissioners that the art would be protected from sale regardless of Detroits situation, said the cost of a millage campaign in a general election would be prohibitive and told commissioners that Macomb County residents would get free admission to the museum if they approve a millage.

Problem No. 1-- easy-money policy from the Federal Reserve: In an ideal world, the Federal Reserve provides the liquidity needed to enable commerce but avoids excess liquidity to avoid either rising prices (which happens when excess money bids up consumer prices) or bubbles (which happens when excess money bids up asset prices). The Fed clearly failed in this regard, as evidenced by unsustainably low interest rates earlier this decade.

The old deli in Manhattan's Lower East Side has the kind of natural, old-school feel that interior designers are paid thousands to replicate in newer places.

You still get assigned a ticket that you hand to the cashier on the way out to calculate your bill. It's a great stop when visiting the nearby Lower East Side Tenement Museum.

I've never quite understood why airlines or online travel agencies issue vouchers that expire.
