Though Motte's botch kept Garcia from becoming the third Cardinals starter to reach 3-0 in the past week, Garcia was good enough to protect the Cardinals' lead despite their own offensive whiffs. The Cards left the bases loaded in the fourth - scoring runs on a groundout and a sacrifice fly - and lined into double plays in the eighth and ninth innings. In both situations, the runner on base broke early and was doubled-up on the bases. Matheny said he will continue to urge such "aggressiveness."
It was the kind of goal that you just can't have, especially in the third period of a playoff game. It was the kind of goal that can crush a team's morale. In that sense, maybe the spotty goaltending of the last few years actually has helped the Flyers. They're immune to post-softie deflation.

18. Webb Simpson, United States -- For a while, it appeared Simpson would not return this week to the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, site of his heartbreaking playoff loss to Bubba Watson last year after he was hit with a one-stroke penalty on the 15th hole in the final round. Simpson's ball was moved by the wind when he addressed it on the green, something that has happened to many players over the years, but this time the USGA and the R&A changed the rule after the season -- perhaps because it seemed to cost Simpson a victory. Now, if an outside force causes a ball to move, there is no penalty. … Simpson has played in the tournament at TPC Louisiana three times previously, and his big performance last year came after he tied for 32nd in 2009 and shot 80-75--155 to miss the cut by a whopping 12 strokes in 2010. This time, he posted four rounds in the 60s and seemed to be headed for his first PGA Tour victory. Instead, he carded two bogeys down the stretch, including the one at No. 15, to wind up in the playoff. Both players birdied No. 18, which was used for both extra holes, but Simpson could not make birdie from a greenside bunker the second time around and Bubba won with a three-foot birdie putt. … That was one of three runner-up finishes for Webb last year, but he finally broke through late in the season to win the Wyndham Championship and the Deutsche Bank Championship two weeks apart. He has three top-10s this season, but this is about where he got rolling last year.

At Desert Trails Elementary School in Adelanto, where the state's second trigger petition was rejected last month, parents don't even want a charter operator. What they seek is the ability to eliminate teachers whom they view as ineffective, pick their own principal and exert authority over their school's budget and curriculum. Those are all understandable goals, but they're not among the options under the poorly written parent trigger law. Many parents signed a petition calling for an independent charter school, run by parents and outside experts, but only in hopes of pressuring the school district to give in to their demands.

• As the Post's Mark Hale explained, the Knicks now have an Amar'e-sized hole in the lineup: "It figures that, as the Knicks did when Stoudemire missed 13 games late in the season with a bulging disk, Carmelo Anthony will shift from small forward to power forward. But that lineup used Landry Fields as the starting small forward and Iman Shumpert — now out with a torn ACL suffered in Game 1 — as the starting two-guard... Assuming Anthony does play power forward, there are a few options. The Knicks could move Fields, who started Game 2 at shooting guard, to small forward and promote sixth man J.R. Smith to starting two-guard... But if Smith starts, the Knicks’ bench will be severely compromised, and their starting five will be incredibly small."

11. June 10 – Tyler Baker, 25. Shot by his friend, Tyler Gregory Smith, 26, of Gresham, who was play-acting with a loaded gun to show how he would respond to an armed robber. Police say he ended up shooting Baker in the chest with a .380-caliber handgun. Smith pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide, and was sentenced to 120 days in jail and eight months of home arrest. Judge Michael McShane noted both men had blood-alcohol contents of .20 percent, and both were fooling with guns. Smith will have to undergo alcohol treatment, face 5 years of probation and 250 hours of community service. For the next five years, on the anniversary of Baker's death, Smith also must write a letter to Baker's family explaining what he is doing to make himself a better person and the world a better place, the judge ordered. Authorities said the men and several others gathered at the home of Matthew Croslin, a mutual friend who lived in the Gateway area. Croslin supplied the gathering with alcohol and showed off the hollow-point bullet that eventually ended up in Smith's .380-caliber semi-automatic pistol. Smith later told police he didn't know -- or couldn't remember -- how the bullet got into his gun, the prosecutor said. SOLVED.

Superficial duct cleaning done by many companies can be a waste. Select someone who will clean the supply and return air ducts, check them for leaks or disconnected joints, and clean your evaporative coils, air-handler cabinet and supply registers.
John the Savage falls for a perky ultramodern girl, but as she obligingly unzips her clothes for him he becomes despondent and flees. It’s too easy. People dropping their pants isn’t love. Compare the dismal reports you hear from campuses that meaningless hookup culture and midnight booty-calling have replaced romance and courting. Women whose grandmothers marched for sexual liberation wonder why they can’t find a man willing to commit. Huxley foresaw that this soul-hollowing effect would follow from making sex purely recreational.
Miranda received instruction on the Marine Corps’ core values – honor, courage and commitment, and what the core values mean in guiding personal and professional conduct.
Stellino explained that such things happen all the time and pointed out the Oakland Raiders recently lost some assistant coaches, too.

Soto's a stickler for detail. Her cooking is full of home-kitchen deliciousness based on recipes she's been honing for years. Before opening her place, seemingly L.A.'s sole Dominican eatery, she used to make Sunday dinners for a Dominican baseball club, according to her daughter Liez Soto-Staley, who manages the restaurant. Now, her food is a potent lure for local Dominicans with a nostalgia for a taste of their Caribbean home — or maybe for El Alto, Manhattan's Dominican enclave on the Upper West Side that's the throbbing heart of the East Coast's Dominican communities.
"All I know is he’s on a west coast tour," Fain said this morning of the Secretary's decision to come to Portland. "We got the call a week ago. It's been fast and furious."
Five-time world champion M.C. Mary Kom hopes to win an Olympic medal for India when women's boxing is introduced at the London Games this summer.
Of course, the cheapest option for the couple would be to commandeer an extra closet, garage or attic space at the home of an obliging family member or friend. My brothers, sister and I have certainly stored our fair share of things at our family homes over the years; decades' worth of books and boxes full of legwarmers and acid-washed jeans once spent years clogging up my parents' basement, just as a Christmas tree, wedding presents and other boxes too large for my sister's tiny first apartment once did hard time in my home's attic. But Joe and Rhonda need to store a house-full of belongings, so they prefer to pay for a place that's easily accessible and convenient.
The leak of confidential information seemed to generate only modest buzz on campus Tuesday afternoon. Some students were unaware of it. And some pointed out that @LindenLeaks had only a modest number of followers.

Despite the dedication of millions of federal dollars to police, prosecutors and judges since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, rates of domestic violence in the United States have not appreciably declined, instead keeping pace with decreases in the crime rate generally. Studies suggest that relatively few women report domestic violence to police; that most of those arrested for domestic violence are not convicted; and that when abusers are convicted, jail time is rare and minimal. Sociologist Evan Stark has argued that the odds of serving jail time for domestic violence are only slightly better than the odds of winning the lottery.
There can be a tendency to see all these dishes as appetizers for the burger. It's a thick disc of vibrant beef, arriving rare, under a thin circle of chevre and what the menu calls shoestring potatoes but are actually more like crunch-providing potato chips. With spicy mayo on a rich, buttery bun, it's a mouthful of tastes and textures, and you can see why Camden has now been inspired to set up his own burger place in the Pearl. (Camden is less of a presence at Yakuza now, working more on Little Big Burger and at Fats; but David Gaspar de Alba, there since the start of this year, clearly has his own mojo.)
Alas, Dan Jauregui is giving up his voluntary gig. He decided to sell his two "Boltman" suits and all the accompanying rights and intellectual properties on eBay.
Rock Night was last night, and the leaderboard was shook up. We know Melissa was taken from the hospital and my source for all Hollywood gossip, my dad, reported to me earlier today that he'd heard "concussion."

Owen eventually catches the eye of Guert Affenlight, the college's middle-age president, who finds himself helplessly drawn into a career-threatening affair. And while the romance's September-May tilt feels somewhat predictable, there's a charming, clumsy sweetness to its development as affection rises around a deep-seated love of literature that becomes a hallmark of the whole novel.
Enterprise has never been used in an actual space mission, but was a full-scale test vehicle used for flights in the atmosphere and experiments on the ground.
Supporters say Warren's image as a crusader on behalf of consumers against well-heeled Wall Street and corporate interests and her national profile would make her a strong candidate, even though she's never run for public office before.

Visitors to the city might have a harder time than residents, but that is not all that different from 1906.
Hey, Tony: The Browns need to draft playmakers and a team with so many needs cannot afford to stockpile picks and expect to compete. They also cannot make many mistakes when drafting. While I agree with the above assessment, how can you continue your past justification of drafting Montario Hardesty? Why would you take that crazy risk with his injury history ? It made no sense! The Browns don't have the luxury of these types of risks. We can also make this argument with T.J. Ward, who the jury is still out on. -- Chris Domathes, New York, N.Y.
He says prayer works  as proof, he points to his $10 million church and its $7 million Family Life Center offering after school programs, Zumba classes and films. Both are paid off.
Hey, Mary Kay: If Seneca Wallace has proven anything in his time with the Browns it's he's not an NFL starter. Wouldn't it make a lot of sense to cut him and then bring in Matt Hasselbeck -- as a backup with the intention of tutoring Colt McCoy?

Incidents like this, and the reaction that follows by certain people whose voices are broadcast across the globe, make achieving peace even harder. It seems that those who parade themselves as being the most patriotic and supportive of our military are often saying and doing things that are putting our troops and nation's interests in further danger.
Now that government spending is measured in the trillions of dollars, it is unclear whether lapses that waste tens of millions or even hundreds of millions register with voters. But any losses from failed oversight can leave McCaskill, a former Missouri state auditor, steaming with outrage as Pentagon and State Department officials squirm at a table in front of her.
Toben was also asked in front of jurors about a sex tape that showed Edwards and Hunter. The tape was found by Young, the former aide who had helped Hunter stay out of the public eye. Toben was Young's friend and neighbor.

Now, once you’ve been given the green light, the next thing to do is rebuild your self-confidence. Get to the gym so you can get your post-baby body back into some sexy clothes and lingerie. It’s not easy gaining extra baby weight, so I can understand if that’s partly why you’re “not feeling” it. (Of course, if your husband’s a good man, he’ll love you even more now that you’ve given birth to his child and it won't matter what you look like — especially if it’s been awhile!) He needs to be sympathetic to what your body and mind just went through!

What I read between the lines of the pledge is that, deep down, even the GOP's sternest budget hawks believe the battle for limited government already has been lost. And until the country chokes to death on its IOUs, there are voters to jolly along and elections to be won.

CHECK THIS OUT: For more than half a century, baseball fans have grumbled about Berry's lyric, making the count two-three with the Brown Eyed Handsome Man at bat.

Corruption so deeply ingrained and occurring over such a span of decades cannot be eradicated by 139-page indictments, trials or plea deals. Even the overhauled county government scheduled to take office next year with a new structure, new checks and balances, ethics policies and a fresh political face will not be able to eliminate all vestiges of this culture of cronyism, backroom deals and patronage hires without months, maybe years of work.

A Walgreen's is already located at that intersection.

The scoring balance — it was really balanced tonight. That's how we're supposed to play."

After the hearing, McKowan said in an interview that she was pleased with the judge's decision. Asked if she expects Ayres to ever be declared competent for another trial, she said she didn't know.
The location, adjacent to the airport, Highway 101 and near three major universities - UC Berkeley, UCSF and Stanford - was ideal. The city helped by enacting ordinances to streamline the startup process for businesses.
Adding to my suspicions is the fact Rivers is in the area right now. The former USC standout, whom the Bengals selected ninth overall in 2008, tweeted to someone Tuesday night he’s “stopping in NYC” on his way back from a trip to France and Italy.

In his final years as comptroller, he proved a shadow of his once-formidable self. And on a few occasions — most famously, when he jokingly asked a female aide to "walk again" so he could watch her from behind — he found the public no longer laughing with him.

Is it just experience? Try biting into a two-day-old piece of French bread and instantly all is revealed. Same way, pull a two-day-old loaf of $5 multigrain out of the breadbox only to find it covered with blue fur, and you relearn the benefits of refrigeration.

Athletes with foot pain or injuries should consult with a sports-medicine expert, trainer or physical therapist before shedding their shoes.

Be careful not to overdo it and give feet and muscles time to adapt. If you aren't willing to give up shoes while running on streets and trails, you might consider switching to a more flexible shoe or one with less padding if you like the way barefoot training feels. Yoga, pilates or group fitness classes that allow you to exercise while barefoot are also options.
