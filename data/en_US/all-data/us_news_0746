So you won't be seeing extravaganzas like last year's "Marigold Wars," a mash-up -- or multidisciplinary fusion, if you will -- of sculpture, puppetry, dance and music from around the globe.

He should have added that such conduct by Leonard is "deplorable, abhorrent and inexcusable."

Notes: There are an estimated 7-8,000 seats in the 300-level of the Rose Garden that are curtained off during Winterhawks games and team president Doug Piper said he intends to keep them that way. Piper said there is no guarantee that the Winterhawks could sell enough tickets to offset the cost associated with staffing the 300-level. He also fears that raising the curtains would detract from the atmosphere that is created when all 10,947 seats in the 100-level, 200-level, and suites are filled. “Simply from a franchise perspective, we really think that making this a hard ticket to get is valuable to us and to the people that get the tickets,” Piper said. “If I open up another 8,000 seats and I sell another 1,000, does that really help what we’re trying to do here? I’m not after every last dollar. That doesn’t necessarily help the franchise as much as creating the demand for the product.” The team set an all-time single-game attendance record of 19,103 for a game against the Seattle Thunderbirds on March 15, 1997.

Now that version of truth -- of recovery and rehabilitation, of hope and optimism in a new postwar era -- is suddenly more tenuous than I could have ever imagined.

Not only has it not weakened the Castro regime, but it has provided it with a neat self-justification, portraying Cuba as the victim of U.S. hostility, elevating Fidel's status within Latin America and embittering Washington's relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.

The basement boom is already generating efforts to restrict it. In London, there have been complaints by neighbors unhappy about noise and vibrations from drilling and digging, which for large or complicated projects can last a year or more. In December, Malcolm Selsdon of the House of Lords introduced a "Subterranean Development Bill" to address concerns over damage to neighboring properties, soil erosion, loss of privacy during construction and financial concerns for homeowners who try to sell or rent their homes while a neighbor is digging. Lord Selsdon says the bill would limit the size and scale of such "iceberg developments," often with more volume underground than above.

In time, to your friends, you will appear to have recovered from your loss. All that really happened, you'll think, is that the hole in the center of your life has narrowed just enough to be concealed by a laugh. And yet, you might feel a pressure for it to be true. You might feel that "enough" time has passed now, that the hole at the center of you should not be there at all.

David Steele, FanHouse: "March Madness can survive a little more of the Colonial, the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference and the Patriot League. And a little less of the Pac-12, and the Big 12, and even the Big Ten and the ACC. Heard this argument before, have you? Of course you have. Because moments like Lehigh's over Duke just keep happening. Norfolk State's over Missouri keeps happening. VCU over almost everybody keeps happening. Butler over almost everybody keeps happening. Look at Gonzaga. That kept happening, over and over and over, now into a second decade. Mark Few himself has said his program is a ‘mid-major' in name only now -- and it's a name he's tired of having attached to it. Yet its conference still isn't major-major, so the label fits, doesn't it?"

A. Absolutely. ... I think all of this uncertainty does have a significant impact on investment in your business. The harder it is to predict what the return on your investment is going to be, the less inclined you are to invest. It's very different for small business owners because it's their money -- it's not stockholders money. It's their money and therefore, the question might be, do I invest in my business, or do I buy the car? Do I invest in my business or put that money into Sally's college fund? These are real gut-wrenching decisions and the more uncertainty you toss in the middle of it, even the most rabid entrepreneurs take a step back and say, golly, I just don't know.

So choose your target as carefully as the hills market to you.

And if you plan a spur-of-the-moment trip, whatever you do, don't visit one of the big resorts and buy a ticket at the window.

Pumpkin also appeared in toasted spelt pasta alla chitarra (the sheet of pasta is cut on a wooden box strung with strings much like a chitarra, or guitar, giving it a square profile instead of round).

Next up on the fragrance front is a bridal scent called Something Blue, which came about after Aerin Lauder, a close friend of the Bolens', called to borrow a wedding gown to use in an ad campaign for Estée Lauder's Beautiful.

There have been many takes on aspirin therapy for women, partly because women respond to it differently than men. Current thinking: Women 55-79 who are at risk of "mini-strokes" (ischemic stroke) should take a low-dose baby aspirin every day. We say two baby aspirin (162 mg) with half a glass of water before and after. Its blood-thinning effects can cut the threat by 17 percent. Aspirin doesn't prevent strokes in men, but it lowers their heart-attack risk, which it doesn't for women under 65 (unless they've had one already).

I carefully chose my dining companions on two recent visits — the first time, broadly traveled foodies from Chicago; the second, a friend and her elderly aunt, the latter someone who doesn't dine out "fancy" too often. The results were predictable: The Chicago group found Bern's tired, retro and campy, its food and service relics from a former era. The aunt, on the other hand, clapped her hands like a kid when presented with her chocolate cake in the Harry Waugh Dessert Room, the rich wedge capped with a spun-sugar cage ensnaring fresh raspberries. She loved the kitchen tour, was awed by the wine cellar.

The Marlins have lost five in a row in San Diego.
One of the more unique features? The property comes with its own water well. Though there still is room to build on the 3.23-acre property, the land is almost entirely landscaped, with about 30 irrigation stations that feed 10-15 sprinkler heads each.
We'd like to think Baca is paying better attention to how deputies comply with the rules. But frankly, there is no way to know — because we don't know exactly what the rules are. The department's use-of-force rules are mostly off-limits to The Times' editorial board and the public in general. That's absurd. TheLos Angeles County Sheriff's Departmentis a public agency. There's no reason its policies should be sheltered from public scrutiny
Tuesday's announcement is part of the health care law's provision of $11 billion to expand and bolster community health centers over five years. HHS says it has already supported the construction and renovation of 190 health centers and the creation of 67 new health centers.

So if you like watching birds, start checking out Point Pelee National Park in a couple of weeks for the start of one of the most spectacular songbird migrations in North America.
The 2007 investigation also found that the district routinely failed to provide services to special-education students, and therefore felt it could not follow through with discipline if the students assaulted a staff member.
Presentations are artistic, but not overworked. Chilled Maine crab salad, which also appears on the regular menu, is carefully displayed behind a stylized V of tomato gazpacho with a thread of cilantro oil in the center and cubes of cucumber gelee that catch the light like emeralds. Every dinner at a top restaurant needs a few "wow'' moments, and this is certainly one of them.
"The first half of this year could be challenging for the diamond sector with rough and polished prices remaining fragile and volatile," RBC analyst Des Kilalea wrote in a note to clients earlier this year.
In contrast, TFF's organizers have gone in the opposite direction: they want their festival to appeal to everyone. Buzz doesn't matter here; satisfaction does.
Einat and Avigdor poured a Shiraz from the Golan Heights and toasted in English and Hebrew. Then the feast began: stuffed eggplant in kiwi-pepper sauce, Norwegian salmon baked in a 10-pound crust of coarse salt, dill potatoes, beans and, finally, white chocolate mousse for dessert.
"It’s that feeling in the pit of the stomach — when you know you’ve tried everything — but there’s nothing left," he said.
But if we are being real, there is more to be gained here than culture. More than half of this roster will not be here next season. More specifically, only one point guard is on contract to return next season: Smith, the rookie point guard out of Duke who has shown enough in his limited time this season to spark intrigue.
Lauren White has done a good job at the point guard spot, and junior classmate Sarah Parker is the shutdown defender. Depth comes from Sydney Bloch, Ashia Jones, Aaliyah Covington and Kortney Dunbar, none of whom are seniors.
Peniche says she did file a stolen property report with police and made Dane and Gayheart aware of the theft. But Gawker.com, which unveiled the tape yesterday, reports that Peniche had more recently been earning a living as a Hollywood madam, and that the Los Angeles Police Department had confiscated the tape while searching for her client list.
Cotto (37-2, 29 KOs), the WBA 154-pound champ, is training in Orlando, Fla.
The next chance was at the Shea Therapeutic Riding Center fundraiser. This is a place where kids who have disabilities can horseback ride. It is a really good place and it helps a lot of kids and people, but mostly kids. Claim Jumper Restaurant is so nice every year to donate all the food for the big party. This year, they had salad, beans, potatoes, bread, and chicken and, of course, ribs. I had the chicken and my mom had the ribs. She gave me a few of her ribs to try and they were so good. They were cooked perfectly, they did not have a lot of sauce, which was good, and they were seasoned with salt and pepper just right. The dessert was chocolate cake.

Rochdale Securities analyst Richard Bove noted the potential for "explosive earnings growth and unusually strong stock price performance" for banks as the economy recovers. Goldman Sachs raised its rating on Bank of America Corp. to "Buy" on expectations for solid earnings in the second quarter. And BMO Capital Markets upgraded its view of the banking industry, anticipating that profits will start to rebound in coming quarters.
His papers were in exceptional condition. "Not too many bloodstains, no insects, no rat turds, no rat corpses," Boyle boasts. Indeed, those are concerns when collecting author archives; at the Ransom Center, they are subject to strict decontamination routines that can include a double deep freeze. Even those extreme measures cannot purge all foreign objects: according to Ransom Center legend, Isaac Bashevis Singer's archive included a pair of pantyhose. Boyle's archive, Barnard confirms, was clean.

"This was simply a matter of the culling of the herd," Swanick said Wednesday. "We operate Suson Park as a working farm and this sale was standard procedure. It had nothing to do with the budget situation."
"As long as I have been with Ford, I don't recall ever having seen a 50-50 mix" between V-6 and V-8 engines in pickups, Pipas said during a conference call with analysts and reporters.

Althoff started the third quarter on the Mater Dei 33 thanks to a 32-yard kickoff return by Harris, but the Crusaders were unable to convert the good field position into points.
Consider Red Violet's mapo tofu, a Sichuan standard rarely seen outside of a few spots in Chinatown. Featuring silky squares of bean curd coddled in a warm gravy whose fiery heat sneaks up the back of your throat and makes your cheeks glow, Red Violet's is quite satisfying. However, this version lacks a proper dose of huajiao (Sichuan pepper). Thus you do not get the citrus punch and mouth-numbing "chili high" available in the version from Lao Szechuan. It also doesn't help that my server forgets to bring a requested set of extra bowls so our group can share. (By the time he returns with the bowls after our second request, the wonderful gravy has started to congeal.)
"In this next step, it's not about the brewing method - it's about the coffee itself," Marquard says. "Any great coffee should taste good any way it's brewed."
A key question - the one that drew Koster into the case - is this: Does the transfer law violate the state constitution by imposing an "unfunded mandate" on suburban schools?

Redistricting is in the hands of the Republican-run Statehouse and Ohio's Republican governor, John Kasich. And you can bet already that at least one Northeast Ohio Democrat is going to be out of a district come the end of 2012. Every Ohio politician, Republican or Democrat, knows that. The Columbia Law plan, drawn in New York, just isn't viable politically.

DeWeese is facing Thomas Greto for the party nod for state Senate. For Assembly, organization-backed Samuel Fiocchi and Suzanne M. Walters face Peter F. Boyce and Paul J. Halley. This Republican-leaning district is represented by three moderate Democrats, and Republicans hope to put it in play in November.

County and municipal forces all around Hunterdon are busy today preparing for the storm, checking the equipment and getting ready to hit the roads once the snow begins to accumulate.
The Hawks have to grind out victories. The Coyotes aren't going to skate up and down the ice with the Hawks. They are content on getting a handful of offensive chances - many coming off Hawks mistakes - and relying on goalie Mike Smith to give them a chance to win.
His franchise value went the way of Joe Paterno's sainthood campaign after James walked out. But owning a NBA team in Cleveland gave him entry into the casino business in Ohio where he will have to get by having the house odds in his favor.

'Parks and Recreation'
While some folks were weeding and spreading mulch, others gathered at the foot of the steps of the Hartley Dodge Memorial to celebrate Arbor Day.

On the series in general: “They played really well. They out-played us in pretty much every part of the game. They played extremely well. We played extremely poorly. It just goes to show you the difference a few days can make. In Colorado, for the most part, we were getting good pitching, some timely hits, running the bases well. It seemed like we brought a lot of energy. Maybe that took some of that out of coming here.
THE LAME RANGERS
Ohio's delegation will likely lose one to two seats when the 2010 Census is completed, which means at least one Democratic district is on the chopping block.
"It looks like a shell game," said Jonathan Goldman, parent and Local School Council member at Drummond Montessori. "It's like they're moving money around. They're saying they're giving schools more discretionary dollars but they haven't identified the nearly $450 million that needs to be cut. And, they wonder why parents are skeptical about all of this."
But trades have depleted the depth, which puts a lot of stress to make successful picks and for the farm system to properly teach these picks. They could use some strength in the middle infield and starting pitching at the higher minor league levels.
"We're winners in Sprint Cup. That's the big deal. To do it at Indy, even bigger deal," he said. "Can't change people's opinions. They're going to say what they want to say. That's fine with me. We'll celebrate this. We'll enjoy it. Whatever they say, they say. Can't control it.

Hers is an interesting chronicle. The beginning of her journey will be familiar, I think, to many in our culture. She writes:
Disappointingly, Buggars had already taken their pumpkin ales off the menu last week, but our knowledgeable waiter recommended a nice Stone IPA from the extensive (40-plus) list of bottled and draft brews.
Barry, you continue to miss the point: The IRS goes too far any time it attempts to censor a pastor's sermon. The government is prohibited from excessively entangling itself with religion by parsing the words of a pastor's sermon to determine whether it violates tax law, which it must do to enforce tax law. That's why it's unconstitutional.

“So we are going to have to be prepared to win every round from the first round on. We cannot expect to come into this fight and win by being on our toes and winning a boxing match with a guy that has the skills of a Yuri Foreman.

Zislin is the owner of the beachfront bar, restaurant and entertainment complex that gives the festival its name. The festival takes place on the wide beach area in front of the easygoing, open-air establishment, a legendary haunt along the Alabama coast. The symbol of both the restaurant and the festival is the shaka, a traditional Hawaiian hand gesture that means "hang loose." If you've seen those commercials touting tourism's rebound along the Gulf Coast since the 2010 oil spill, that's Zislin in the Gulf Shores segment, flashing the shaka sign in front of his restaurant.

BACK THEN, John Fairchild, the man who invented fashion gossip via his Women's Wear Daily, claims his W deserves credit for Sondheim's song phrase. Fairchild also thought up the idea of sending photographers to snap those who didn't really like to be photographed -- Babe Paley, Marella Agnelli, the Duchess of Windsor, Jackie O. "The idea was that there was a certain group of ladies who were admired and were dressed and in those days that was important," said Mr. Fairchild.
She said every major doll designer signs his or her doll under the wig on the neck. Everyone who makes a doll from that pattern, then signs in the same way to show it isn’t made by the originator, but is a copy. “That prevents counterfeiting,” she said, because many originals run into the thousands of dollars to buy.

"We had a mentally ill customer assault one of my staff while I was out of the building. He got in her face and roughly grabbed her arm. I got a positive ID of him today and approached him. He immediately got in my face and started shouting profanities. I tried to give him the option to calm down or leave, but he wouldn't listen. So I demanded he leave . . . he did try and get on a computer. I took his library card, at which point he rushed me and grabbed my arm. I broke free and called the police . . . "
Take the Baked Ravioli ($6.25 for a half-portion). The surprise is in the sauce: a visually attractive mix of velvety asiago cream sauce and San Marzano marinara. The Salumi Sliders ($7.50) are clean-your-plate tasty. Mild, artisan-crafted Italian salumi (salami) was topped with sun-dried tomatoes and a drizzle of fruity olive oil served on minibuns made of focaccia bread. The 9-inch Pancetta & Pomodoro pizza ($10.95) is equally tasty. The dough had a thin but extra-crispy outer crust and a light and airy interior.

Will ("Easy A") Gluck's movie -- script by Gluck, David A. Newman and Keith Merryman -- is all about the New York/L.A. conflict. Everybody in NYC yanks poor Dylan's chain, with sarcastic, biting put-downs, fake threats and come-ons. The works. There's Woody Harrelson, cast against type as a butch yet over-the-top gay sports editor, and in a hilarious cameo, gonzo snowboarder Shaun White repeatedly scares the bejeezus out of the overmatched Dylan. No wonder he clings to Jamie, his first friend in New York. She's into weepy romantic comedies, which they watch together.

"When you don't hit shots, it snowballs," Hill said. "We talked about keeping East St. Louis from getting out in transition, and we did a very good job in the first two quarters to prevent that. In the third quarter, we let them leak out on us and they got some easy buckets."

There are some things Id do differently. As I said, I wouldnt put my hands on the scales of the bankruptcy process. I also would have distributed the shares that were owned by the public to the public. Either sell the shares or distribute them.
