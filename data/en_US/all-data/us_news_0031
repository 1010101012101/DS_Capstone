Consumers expect to be able to hear a recording before committing it to their collection. The challenge for artists and labels is to persuade potential fans to do so on legitimate, royalty-paying sites. At the same time, they have to find ways to introduce themselves to new generations of listeners.

For Lynn, the lockdown extended a run in which he has allowed only 10 hits and three earned runs in 19 innings. Friday's 84-pitch outing accounted for most of the Pirates' frustration on a night when they never took an at-bat with a runner in scoring position. Lynn insists he doesn't know his numbers - a 1.42 ERA and nearly twice as many strikeouts (17) as hits allowed. He does know that a more aggressive pitching style serves him better than the nibbler's style he attempted in two starts last season.

"With the Net," Simmons explains, "things get lost. We thought it would be cool to see it in book form." The idea, he continues, is to use the quarterly to capture — and, in a sense, preserve — a particular period in the life of the site: the months leading up to each issue.

Q: What was so effective about that approach?
Oh, Canada, so near and yet so far. We share a language, albeit with different notions of how to pronounce "sorry" and "about"; we use your streets and your studios to stand in for America in our budget-conscious television shows, and your actors to represent Americans, and your film crews to record them. And yet your own television is something quite different.

When it comes to showing what some kids go through on a daily basis, "Bully" concentrates on the situation of 12-year-old Alex Libby of Sioux City, Iowa.

Still, Cain, who never has held political office, clearly has struck a chord with a part of the Republican electorate craving a fresh face not tied to the GOP establishment.

Crushers 4, RiverHawks 0: Left-hander Paul Fagan (7-10) pitched a six-hitter, and Pat Norris hit his first homer of the season as host Lake Erie blanked Rockford (Ill.) in a Frontier League contest in Avon.
HEADLINE in the Brand Expaper, referring to the warm and sunny S.F. weather: "Summer Takes One Last Shot." Written by an auslander, obviously. Summer here is cold and foggy. What was happening last wk. was typical S.F. November weather ... Brand Ex and the better newspapers blamed the low voter turnout last wk. on "a lack of big issues." What a laugh. There are dozens of big, even HUGE, issues, ranging from Reykjavik (what happened?) to Nicaragua (wotinell are we doing?) to our trillion-dollar debt, but the Democrats are afraid to take them on for fear of being called "liberal." We are being nibbled to death by nonentities ... I can't figure out why Rambo Reagan never won an Oscar. What an actor! With a straight face, the biggest spender in our history accuses the Demos of "violating the public treasury," and the damn dumb Dems take it. Hitch up the horses, Maw, we're movin' on.

A: We could have made 1,200 of these for the cost of one "Star Trek." Literally. We made this for $250,000. I think that's hilarious. That's probably half a day on the set of "Star Trek." It's a completely different world. Especially with a story like this, it's a very intimate setting. The crew is very limited. I think we had a total crew of maybe 10 people, and Drake wouldn't allow any of them on-set. It was just us and the operator and the sound guy. ...

Inside tight confines, gigantic flavors march out of Scott Dolich's open kitchen. His ever-changing menu packs unique dishes such as the spring salad with ramps, asparagus tips and a slightly seasoned "magic egg" nestled in the center.

Do you see any thematic connection between your work in documentaries and your work in fiction films? In all my films, I'm interested in larger-than-life characters. But in documentaries, I'm trying to take the chaos of real life and make it as compelling as fiction, while in fiction films, I'm trying to make a made-up story seem like reality. So in a way they are opposites and use different parts of my brain. It's like the difference between journalism and art.

"We won't have Mota for a while. It is what it is, and you move on," manager Bruce Bochy said before the Giants began a three-game series against the Dodgers. "If we get into a situation where we need a pitcher, we're going to have to make a change. Right now we're going with 11 pitchers, and if we have to adjust, we will. We've got some pretty good options, we think, and Brian (Sabean) and I will continue to talk about them."
Still, Gillespie was in no position to enjoy the no-hitter because of the tyranny of pitch counts, and because college coaches are sensitive to the accusation that they will force a pitcher to throw until the shoulder turns medium rare.

The home run structure at the Marlins' new ballpark isn't exactly an attractive piece of art. But let's be fair. It's no harder on the eyes than, say, if the neighbor kids TP'd your house on the same day your wife got you a front yard pink flamingo birthday display...

"True Love was great but it got to the point where the only time I was really having fun was when I was doing shows with the Guitar Bar All-Stars or something where I was playing a lot of covers," Hartel adds. "For a while I was doing a Rolling Stones cover band with my wife Tammy Faye Starlight, and then we started doing the Who covers thing. And I was finding a lot more excitement in that because people really listen to it and you can share the enthusiasm they feel for those great old songs. But then Tom starting writing these original Platinum Load songs that had that same feeling, and it felt like we were really saying something that had to be said."
Pujols' lead agent, Dan Lozano, visited camp last week without engaging the club in negotiations over an extension. Pujols has asked the club to refrain from commenting on the matter but insisted he believes an agreement is possible. "If we start talking all it takes is 24 hours to reach an agreement. I don't think it takes a month or two months or a year," said Pujols, who is under contract through 2011 but enjoys veto power over any deal following the 2010 season.

Personal story: "Sophomore year during a soccer game, I fell and found out that I had torn my labrum in my shoulder. I would have to have surgery. After having six anchors put in my shoulder and months of rehab, it came time for softball season again. I was not yet able to throw; I even tried to switch to throw left-handed, but it didn't work. So I was the designated hitter for the season and cheerleader while my team was on defense. Our team ended up winning districts and going on to take the state championship. I was able to end the season with a .340 batting average and have the game-winning RBI squeeze bunt in the state championship game."
It wasn't just Clooney who seemed flustered. Sandra Oh, who won the TV best supporting actress award ("Grey's Anatomy") was so befuddled she could barely navigate through the maze of tables on her way to the stage. Others wept.

Are we surprised that "American Reunion" — the latest in the surprisingly lasting "American Pie" series — starts with a dual masturbatory scene? Are we surprised young women in bikinis, lingerie and much less dominate many of the film's familiar shots?

To us mere and unworthy mortals who watch these games rather than participate in them, making a play out of the corner, in traffic or on the fly, is tantamount to a big-league hitter being able to pick up the spin of a 92-mph cutter out of a pitcher’s hand.

There’s no denying a well-rounded live performance makes or breaks the song. True, sometimes all you need is a microphone and a spotlight. However, other times, you really need some pyrotechnics. You know, just to heat things up.

A second summit was held in 2007 with South Korea's Roh Moo-hyun.
I appreciated state Rep. Paul Thissen's April 11 counterpoint ("GOP's lips say 'yes' to jobs; actions say 'no'). I especially appreciated his urging the Legislature to "pass a balanced and robust bonding package that will put people back to work right now." A bonding bill that includes funding for affordable housing statewide will not only create jobs but will add stability to communities. It's win-win. Jobs and housing!

The couple started thinking about leaving Arizona when Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio began conducting his crime sweeps two years ago, saturating largely Latino neighborhoods with deputies, stopping vehicles for minor traffic violations and arresting illegal immigrants. The couple said the sweeps made them feel like prisoners. They used to enjoy spending Sundays at the park. But to avoid the police, they started staying home as much as possible.

At issue is Egypt's influential cabinet of ministers, which the generals appointed late last year, before Egypt's first post-revolutionary national elections gave the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party a strong plurality in the new parliament.

The former House speaker leaves the GOP campaign with his reputation battered and his wallet empty. He is looking to repair his standing in the party as the intellectual heavyweight and for an opportunity to push conservative policy goals.

The Rebels got to within a goal at 9-8 early in the third quarter, but that was as close as they would get. Prep scored its final goal with 23 seconds remaining, but the team couldn't get the ball back to try and cut the lead to one and hopefully get a chance for a tie.
Clymer noted that the party was not on the ballot in California or Pennsylvania, and in 2004 those states accounted for 33,000 votes. The Baldwin-Castle ticket even grabbed 3,418 write-in votes in Texas, the highest for any write-in candidate in that state.

Jonathan Turley is probably not the most popular man right now with supporters of same-sex marriage. The George Washington University law professor has filed a suit challenging the constitutionality of Utah's anti-polygamy laws — and his argument is based on a landmark 2003 Supreme Court gay rights decision. That's not good news in the view of most gay rights supporters, who don't want their cause linked to that of polygamists any more than they want to see parallels drawn with people who engage in incest, bestiality and other taboo sexual practices.
Budish's prominence as an advocate for the elderly has drawn attention this year because of his ties to the nursing-home industry, a powerful lobby that works hard to preserve its piece of the Medicaid pie and contributes generously to lawmakers.
The Clarks gave Mulfinger and Kemp carte blanche on the design, but there were some things that were not negotiable: They wanted plenty of room for their three kids and their friends, a studio space for Tara and a design that steers clear of superfluous sentimentality.

I won't argue the pros and cons of STAR testing, per se, so hold your emails about what it was like in the good old days when you walked to school uphill both ways.
With this in mind, when the woman behind the counter at Butcher & The Burger asks me how I'd like my burger cooked, I stare at her for about 10 seconds? When I regain my senses, even though I really want medium-rare, some conditioned reflex has me stammering "medium." When I fully realize I actually have a choice, I apologize and change my order to medium-rare. I'm pretty sure the cashier thinks I'm on drugs.
The whole cluster of Glenelg (7-1) and then all of the 5-3 teams has become really muddled now, but let me explain why Reservoir gets the nod over the pack. Of the Gators' three losses, two are to Atholton and River Hill. The other was to Long Reach in week three. The Gators beat Glenelg two weeks ago. Finally, Reservoir has the fourth best offense and third best defense in the league. This is their spot to lose.

No decision on the appeal is expected until late winter or spring, and it's not yet clear on what grounds neighbors will argue their case.

Last month, Juniper cited price competition as one reason it reported profit margins that were lower than many analysts estimated. In addition, some customers were waiting for the rollout of Juniper's new T4000 router.
3) Early lead. It’s not a stretch to say that every team enjoys taking an early lead as it allows them to control the game’s tempo and be patient on offense. But ESPN analyst and former Johns Hopkins All-American goalkeeper Quint Kessenich said jumping out early would be more beneficial for the Blue Jays than Loyola. “I think the early lead is extremely important because Johns Hopkins as a team has proven that they’re not built to come back from behind,” Kessenich said. “They’re just not that quick on defense. You saw them fall behind Navy and when Navy spread them out and attacked them with their quick players, Hopkins lacked a certain quickness on defense. If the Blue Jays fall behind, that does not cater to their defensive strengths.”
An additional 14 acres are devoted to Pinot, and in the Windy Oaks' brochure, the couple, both in their 50s and until 10 years ago globe-trotting high-tech consultants, tout their Burgundian-style Pinot Noir, with its "elegant fruit kick, a long and satisfying finish, and some mineral nuances that reflect the unique terroir of the vineyard." At small vineyards, duties are divided among family or friends.

We are becoming a nation that despises the successful. But only in business. This article is typical of the Post-Dispatch attempt to promote class warfare. How about same type of reporting on the highest-paid players in NBA, NFL or MLB. Or still better, the overpaid Hollywood elitists?
The best parts are the in-between ones, neither laugh-out-loud funny nor overtly heart-wrenching: a silent prologue in which Adam, an NPR radio reporter in Seattle, reveals his earnest, somewhat passive nature by waiting for a don't-walk sign on an early-morning jog through empty streets; the stirrings of Kyle's good and generous heart when it isn't outpaced by his potty mouth, which he deploys as a defense against the pain he feels for his friend; the tinkly ridiculousness of the New Age pap that Katherine plays as background music for her patient's relaxation exercises, or her sweet confusion about the efficacy versus the propriety of touching Adam's arm during their therapy sessions.
That's the suggestion from officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, following earlier studies of theirs that made the same point. Says their new paper: "A tax of one cent an ounce on sugar-sweetened beverages -- about a 10 percent price increase on a 12-ounce can -- would be likely to be the single-most effective measure to reverse the obesity epidemic."
The bottom line isn't just that prisoners, like anyone else, should have access to adequate medical care, said Caroline Isaacs, director of the American Friends Service Committee's Tucson office, which monitors state prisons. "Ninety percent of them will get out of prison, so treating HIV or hepatitis C or whatever they have prevents a public- health risk, or they'll get out and get on AHCCCS and we're paying for it anyway."

Steill says everything left here needs to find a permanent home within 24 hours. "People are so busy, coming in with things and not putting them in a specific place," she says. But the "do it later" approach always comes at a price. "Clutter is delayed decisions," she says.
Midtown wouldn't yet qualify as a success story by revitalization standards in New York or Chicago. The 2-square-mile collection of smaller neighborhoods north of downtown still has vacancies and lacks the bustling, thriving feel of some of those larger cities' neighborhoods in transition. But it has solid anchors in Wayne State University, the Detroit Medical Center and cultural institutions such as the Detroit Institute of Arts and Orchestra Hall, as well as a growing number of startups and rehabilitation projects, and people are moving in thanks to relocation incentives offered by their employers.
Legrand and Scally stress that their enigmatic reputation isn't a calculated attempt to build mystery, but an effective way of separating the music from the frivolous.
Child development experts said the findings were interesting but that it would be premature to suggest that the results could help explain the dramatic rise in diagnosed cases of autism over the last decade.
Cassano said the aquarium will modify its advice for commercial fish buyers to clearly distinguish between the Columbia and Sacramento catches. The cards are too small for that distinction, he said, but the aquarium encourages consumers to question retailers and restaurant servers on the nuances.

The Big Ten vs. Southeastern Conference matchup was one-sided pretty much from the outset.
The service is simple, streamlined, and easy to get up and running. You visit the Dropbox website, sign up for a free account, download Dropbox for your computer, and that’s pretty much it. Drop a file into the Dropbox folder and you’ll have access to it anywhere. But that’s just the beginning, as Dropbox is increasingly a conduit for data storage on mobile devices. Look in the settings on the apps on your smart phone or tablet computer, and you may very well come across options to use Dropbox as a way to synchronize the notes, images and other data in your apps.
At the nexus of it all was an informant, Solomon Dwek, who secretly began cooperating with the government after he was charged in an unrelated, $50 million bank fraud.

President Barack Obama is given to cute vehicular metaphors about the state of the economy. We were "in a ditch," then got out and hit a "bump in the road." This is studiously folksy. It also vastly understates the nature of our situation.
I would like to thank Wagner for bringing to the table Sharp, Steve Green, Kansas City school board members, the mayor’s representative and Families for Home Education.
The manager said the fact that the club is in the middle of playing 36 games in 37 days, 29 of those on the road also factors into resting Ryan.

And in other places, jobs sat vacant while districts searched for the right candidate. DePue High School, in the tiny town of DePue, Ill., didn't find a new principal until its second year in the program. Baltimore, which brought in outside groups to manage five of its seven SIG schools under the little-used "restart" option, saw a big turnover in principals: Two of those schools went through three principals in the first year, while another had its principal replaced mid-year.

In the sashimi-style dishes, diners can choose from hamachi with ponzu vinaigrette, jalapeno and white truffle oil ($12); tombo tuna with heirloom tomatoes and the sharp flavors of aji Amarillo ($12); or a very expensive Kobe beef ($13), where the paper-thin slice of generously marbled meat is overwhelmed by chanterelles and overly generous drizzles of ginger chimichurri, horseradish aioli and soy caramel emulsion, all strong flavors that
“While Oregon has long been considered a national leader in the area of assessment, we know that a true 21st-century assessment system can do more to support and inform instruction, engage students in learning, and provide meaningful data on student achievement and growth," she said.

That might not sound like a lot, but Dr. Donald Redelmeier, the University of Toronto physician who led the study, said it means an average of about 13 extra deaths a day and amounts to about $40 million in annual losses to society, counting loss of life, injury and property damage costs.
In 2010, Butler had 3,412 out-of-state applicants; the year after the title-game loss to Duke, the number increased 63 percent to 5,551. That resulted in a first for the school: an entering class with more students from out of state than from Indiana. Just as impressive, the number of out-of-state applicants for this year's freshman class increased yet again, by 12 percent.
"We might get a year with none. We might get two to three a year," Gates said. "Most are so small people don't even notice them."
I, for one, happened to enjoy those nighttime runs. Between the cooler temperatures and total seclusion, I found running at night almost blissful. Never mind the occasional leap into tall grass to avoid an oncoming truck. Others found this whole part of the experience terrifying.
The show lacked the feel of WrestleMania; the first hour felt rushed and most of the matches seemed to be missing something. The show wasn't bad by any means, so I don't want people to misread what I am saying, but I expected more.

I had only limited experience with the breed before mine chose me, but I have discovered that they are wonderful, wonderful dogs, incredibly smart and ridiculously affectionate.

Complicating matters, however, are Eric's unexpected new feelings for Kelly (Leslie Bibb), the perky sales agent for his father's house.

Daniel Bryan and AJ have consistently been the highlight for me on Smackdown week after week. I thoroughly enjoy the sneaky, conniving Bryan weaseling his way out of sticky situations, and I look for him to do exactly that on Sunday. The Royal Rumble is certainly not the focal point going into this match, and it's not that Sheamus is looking weak going into the PPV; it's that Daniel Bryan is looking so strong. Sheamus has a great rivalry going at this time, which is why I see the World Heavyweight Champion escaping with the gold (much to the chagrin of the WWE Universe) and there being a PPV rematch with a stipulation that doesn't allow Bryan to use his same tactics again.

An hour later, the senator stood before about 100 residents, including 40 students, in Condon High School's multipurpose room, where he spelled out his rules: only one question per person until everyone's had their chance, then you can ask another; and no punching anybody out, even if you disagree with them.

"The university continues to work with the NCAA as they investigate matters involving our football program, and we will continue to do so until the conclusion of the investigation," Lynch said. "We are unable to comment on specific players' situations because of federal law."
"The presence of the County Hospital allowed for the extraordinary exclusion of black patients from almost all other hospitals," Ansell wrote.

A. How difficult it is depends on the movie. But I didn’t not make a movie because it was difficult. I was just burned out. Utterly. I’d started making films in 1970, and all the time since then I was directing, writing, composing… I was just so tired of it. I had lost some of my passion and I had to rekindle that.

I found myself in that exact place almost 11 years ago. After years of fertility treatment, there I was watching the ultrasonographer and counting baby one, baby two and baby three. On the screen were three tiny circles, and on subsequent ultrasounds, three tiny beating hearts. Due to excellent care, prayers and a little luck, I am blessed today with three healthy children.

The governor and his wife reported $20,480 in charitable contributions. They paid $147,118 in federal taxes and $33,564 in state taxes. While the governor was due a refund, he applied the credit to his 2010 estimated taxes.

The OLCC is also suggesting allowing some grocers to become liquor agents, creating stores within stores so someone can truly do one-stop shopping when it comes to getting items for an alcohol-inclusive party. Think of all the double trips made this week as people shop for their New Year's parties. The busy holiday season is a good time to get people on board with the need for changes. And in an area so aware and rightly concerned about vehicle-related pollution, it'd be surprising if there was not a wide swath of people behind the new rules for that concern alone.
