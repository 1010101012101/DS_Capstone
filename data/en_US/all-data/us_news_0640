By now, his sonic signature is one of hip-hop’s most recognizable. The kick and snare: up-front, loud, sometimes frantic, always hard-hitting. The samples: old soul, grimy when necessary, wistful whenever possible. The synthesizers: stuttering deep bass and thick portamento Moog over the top. On the cover of “Tronic,” his last album, he posed in front of a bank of vintage analog synths. He knows his way around those dusty buttons and dials. Many of his tracks end with a 30-second instrumental recapitulation of the main musical themes, and these instant remixes underscore the moodiness of his production.

Kid-friendly stylus apps abound, though I especially like the free Kids Magic Draw app. Three options from the home screen let kids choose Cartoon, Magic or Paint. In Cartoon, kids tap objects to add them onto the page; Magic turns the stylus into a wand that adds color to black and white pictures; and Paint is like a coloring book on steroids, letting a child choose a color to be smeared across the screen with a stylus or finger.

Go kayaking in the scenic tidal creeks and marshes or take a dolphin watching eco cruise on the bay. The Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo, located a couple of miles from the festival grounds, is a don't-miss attraction for animal lovers, known as "the little zoo that could" from its feature series on Animal Planet.

I never planned to own a business. For several years I was quite content working as a designer for an interior designer who focused on selling the work. But when I got an unexpected opportunity to take over the business about 20 years ago it was an easy transition because clients were used to working with me. It didn't take long for me to start making big changes though, mainly with customer service. I let customers know that I would make myself available to them 24 hours a day if necessary. I wanted to accommodate their schedules.

"I can see in some ways the antecedent to my attraction to 'Take Shelter' -- a very unconventional narrative, very asymmetrical, doesn't adhere to any one formal structure. 'Vertigo' is a very haunting, visceral experience. And the fact that there's a twist, I really responded to. Being manipulated by the filmmaker, I had never felt that before. I thought that was really cool."

Also, his $19 million salaries in 2015 and 2016 aren't guaranteed for any reason if Manning isn't on the Denver roster.

While Miller has already said he wants senators to reserve May 14-15 as the dates for a special session, Busch has so far resisted narrowing the time the Assembly might reconvene to a specific day. Part of the reason appears to be that as the leader of a body three times as large as the Senate, Busch needs more time to achieve consensus among members of his caucus and to ensure the votes will still be there to pass the budget measures left on the table last month.

The Kinshasa Symphony (you can look them up on the Internet for more information) was the brainchild of a man named Armand Diengienda, a DRC native and former airline pilot. The airline for which he worked went out of business 20 years ago. Following his loss of employment, he decided to follow a passion for classical music, learned how to read music and how to play several instruments. He decided he'd find as many others as he could who wanted to do the same things. They had instruments donated, found some in garbage dumps, repaired them and made learning and playing of music the only focus of their lives. Word about this growing presence spread. Conductor Diengienda, via two Germans who decided to produce a documentary about his miraculous work, recruited two professional classical German vocalists and musicians to coach his fledgling performers. They were featured on tonight's telecast. One of them remarked how unheard of it would be in Germany (or anywhere in the Western world) for people to walk 90 minutes each way through primitive surroundings and dirt trails simply to play in an orchestra or sing in a chorus, but that's what these performers do...for no pay.

Or you can get really creative and use different kinds of teas. Camomile adds an herbal note. If you can find a really nice jasmine tea, that adds a spectacular floral fragrance.

And bubble teams everywhere were very thankful the Tigers came out on top of Penn Tuesday night in the season-finale. That put Harvard into the field for the first time in 66 years — 1946! — and took one potentially bid-steal scenario out of play.

We were starving by the time we arrived at our bed and breakfast, not far from the main plaza in the colonial city of Salta. We wandered into a cozy Italian restaurant around the corner at close to midnight. Finally, after days of dining in near-empty restaurants, even at 9 p.m., we were eating on Argentine time.

Perry just completed her testimony, a bare-bones description of what it's been like for her to grow up a lesbian in conservative Bakersfield and now find herself fighting for the right to marry. Perhaps her most emotional moment came when she described attending football games with Stier at the high school where two of their four boys go, and going into the stands with the other parents.

Since 2008, the state has run eight such pilot courts. The Michigan Department of Community Health and State Court Administrative Office administers a federal stimulus grant that provides about $500,000 a year for the courts and another $1.1 million to bolster community mental health services in the surrounding communities. But the three-year grant expires later this year, and the mental health court pilots will end unless the state Legislature finds another way to fund them.

Brown has a reputation for impressive turnarounds and often messy departures from teams.

Would Moss fit in Baltimore? My guess is no, but this is purely speculation. Moss turned 35 today, he didn’t play in 2011, and he bounced from New England to Minnesota then Tennessee in his turbulent 2010 season. It’s fair to wonder how much Moss can contribute physically and whether his heart is in the right place as he attempts his comeback to the NFL. I’m sure he will generate some interest.

“People are eager for tax relief,” said poll Director David Redlawsk. “Yet for most New Jerseyans the burden they feel comes from property taxes, more than from income taxes.

As Senate President, I am committed to bringing all underfunded districts up to the adequacy standard, which will ensure proper funding for the state's 205 underfunded districts. Using the state’s windfall, we should provide additional funding for all inadequately funded districts across New Jersey. This will render the court’s decision a moot point.

The difference is huge. Wrapping a kid in caution tape is dumb, unprofessional and probably punishable. Binding and gagging a child is nightmarishly abusive and criminal, an act that conjures fears of sadomasochism and pedophilia. These are not minor details we're talking about, especially for parents.
Some 24 days after the Boles killing, somebody shot Fields nine times while he was driving on McKinnon Avenue approaching Third Street in San Francisco, in Bayview. Fields' girlfriend, Latoya Heckard, testified Tuesday she was sitting next to Fields in the front seat. She said Fields had just passed her a "blunt"  a hollowed-out cigar packed with marijuana  while their three children and his mother were in the back seat.

“Look, just a few years ago, President Obama – then a candidate – said in a speech that if we had actionable intelligence of a high-value target in Pakistan, we’d go in and get that high value target,” Gibbs said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “Mitt Romney said that was foolish.

Their research concluded that the star must have had earlier brushes with the black hole, which stripped its outer layers of hydrogen away so that little was left of the star save its helium core. Astronomers had already predicted that such stripped stars surround the black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.

Women generally do not have a second child until they have finished breast-feeding their first. Humans typically suckle their children for a little over two years, a relatively short time compared with their maximum 120-year lifespan. Female chimpanzees, in contrast, suckle their young for four to five years out of their maximum lifespan of only 60 years. Chimp populations are thus much smaller than human populations.

A. No, I was always going to play the role, at least since we got involved in the project. The concept is simple – a guy and his sidekick fight crime but don't get along because the sidekick does everything better than the main guy. That seemed perfect for me to play.
