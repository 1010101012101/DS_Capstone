A kaleidoscopic array of curry houses, sweets counters, sari shops, Bollywood video stores, cash-and-carry outlets, and much more, Little India, along Newark Avenue, may be the state’s most colorful commercial thoroughfare. The names alone are intoxicating. Ganesh Dosa House. Baba Hut. Bengali Sweets, Singas Famous Pizza. And my favorite, a restaurant known as OK Horn Please, after a phrase commonly painted on cars and trucks in India. Southern Indian and Northern Indian food, produce, fruits, appliances, clothing — it’s all here. Start your journey at the corner of Newark Avenue and Kennedy Boulevard, walking west on Newark Avenue. On the weekend, the streets and sidewalks can get crowded, but that’s the appeal.

At least up until now, Best Buy has resisted some of the Black Friday creep, allowing its fans to sleep in a bit more by opening its doors at 5 a.m. last year. (But of course, some eager beavers still camped out to be the first in line.) So it will be interesting to see if it joins the fray and opens earlier this year, too.
Rick Santorum, the defeated former senator from Pennsylvania, was given no chance when he announced his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. Rejected by the Republican establishment supporting Mitt Romney, he waged a lonely and underfunded grassroots effort that ultimately gave him the edge in the Iowa caucuses. This past Tuesday he won all three primaries in Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri, and now finds himself tied with frontrunner Mitt Romney according to the latest Fox News poll.
Sources familiar with Saints game-day operations told ‘Outside the Lines' that Loomis, who faces an eight-game suspension from the NFL for his role in the recent bounty scandal, had the ability to secretly listen for most of the 2002 season, his first as general manager of the Saints, and all of the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The sources spoke with ‘Outside the Lines' under the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals from members of the Saints organization.

Once the clock started ticking, it didn't take long for H.K. Anderson ($7.49 for 52 ounces at Costco) to run away from the pack. These "plump" pretzels had a "crunchy exterior" and a "creamy peanut butter inside." "Intensely salty, but with lots of peanut butter filling for balance," this pretzel was a winner all-around. Four would buy this brand, and the fifth might.
"It's all just so terrible," Barkman said.

In the Senate this year, Democrats proposed expanding it to specifically protect gays, lesbians and transsexuals in a move designed in part to prod Republicans into opposing the overall bill.

I know Barner appeared to indicate he was staying, but I don't think we will know for sure until the declaration deadline is behind us. Running backs take a beating.

Environmentalists aren't happy. They vow to fight any new Northwest coal export terminals on global warming and pollution grounds -- at the same time they're lobbying to close Boardman and Washington's only coal-fired plant in Centralia and celebrating laws in Oregon and Washington that effectively bar new coal plant construction.
For the same reason I don't go to Laclede's Landing or the big bars surrounding Busch Stadium, I couldn't find much to do in Wrigleyville. It's not a knock on the many bars that line Clark Street; it's just an acknowledgement that I am way too old for the mad crush of crowds and eardrum-piercing noise.
What left many Maryland fans I know counting the days until next season begins– unlike football fans who are still trying to figure out whether or not to dump or renew their tickets – was a recruiting class that got another boost this week and the manner in which the Terps seem to respond Turgeon’s blunt and often blistering critiques.
Avocado's texture is also easily thinned with liquids to make creamy beverages. A vegan Avocado Frappé Smoothie uses soymilk and brown sugar, while the nonvegan alternative with milk and sweetened condensed milk emulates more closely the sweetened avocado drinks that are popular in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. And in the true spirit of Cinco de Mayo, consider toasting General Seguín's victory with an Avocado Margarita.

In 1912, the "State Fish Car" -- a railroad car -- was wheeled down the tracks to Waconia, containing an estimated 2.25 million northern pike fry, all of which were dumped into the lake. Ten years and millions more fry later, the effort paid off: A man named A.J. Schutz boated an 11-pounder.

"For more than 30 years, our citizens have paid a one-penny sales tax for regional transit," Wood wrote.

"Deeply grieved," said Wanly when interviewed inside the wall-to-wall carpeted mosque north of the campus. If Mohamud did what he's accused of, "he destroyed his future.

Making sure the kids get enough exercise in the summer months can be a challenge ("enough" being the amount it takes to tire them out so they don't have the energy to drive me crazy). During the school year they have gym and playtime with their classmates to tucker them out, and a trip down to the park can always take that extra edge off. But in the summer, parents have to find new ways to run the rug rats ragged because much like a bored golden retriever chewing up the entire house when left alone, if you don't exercise them, they will destroy everything and everyone you hold dear.

Hawi: The hub of lush North Kohala on the Big Island is Hawi, a three-block stretch of storefronts where mountain-hugging Highway 250 and the coastal Highway 270 intersect. It was once home to the Kohala Sugar Co., drawing Filipinos, Chinese and Japanese to work in the mills. Their free time was often spent at the area’s range of temples, churches and chapels. The last mill closed in 1975 and the elderly, former sugar workers now share the town with artists, balding hippies and other end-of-the-road types who have opened galleries and coffeehouses. The mix of locals has changed, but the pace is still languid.

I dont really care who takes credit for it, really. Truth be told, President Bush put in the first money. Truth be told, President Obama put in the biggest chunk of the money and he had to have the team to do the restructuring. To put in money isnt enough. Youve got to do something with it, and I thought they did a good job with the restructuring.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak replied, “What’s wrong in these critical remarks is the built-in assumption that the governor does not care about the Highlands watershed or conservation of that area of New Jersey. That is just plain wrong. Unfortunately, there’s hardly an interest group or advocacy group that received state funding that didn’t have it cut, in some cases dramatically. These are difficult times — to put it mildly — and all funding will be reassessed and prioritized once our revenues increase, reform is put in place and we stabilize our fiscal position. We will also continue to look closely to determine whether the previous structure and roles of funded organizations were effective and efficient.”
Indians President Mark Shapiro seemed to be having a blast last week as employees and invited guests brought their kids to try out the new spaces.
But let's be fair. That's not exactly true. God is not really gay, per se. God is more... pansexual. Omnisexual. Gender neutral. Gender indeterminate.

Most likely to contribute early: Kelechi Osemele. The Ravens waited until the second day of the draft to finally address their most pressing offseason need: the offensive line. They lost Ben Grubbs in free agency and missed out on Evan Mathis, who re-signed with the Philadelphia Eagles, leaving a big question mark at left guard. This versatile, athletic lineman will compete for a spot in the starting lineup right away, either battling Jah Reid for the left guard spot or getting in the mix at tackle (he would be a right tackle, but there are potentially moving parts there in Bryant McKinnie and Michael Oher).
Ken Lanci, Independent: An audience member posed a hypothetical question regarding private donations: If you were an investor who wanted to choose just one group to support, which would it be?

No charges or internal disciplinary measures were filed when the investigation failed to turn up solid evidence.

While working as a nutrition educator at Community Mercantile in Lawrence, Kass encountered a steady stream of customers with food sensitivities. There are plenty of grains that can stand in for wheat, but Kass was unfamiliar with many of them. Curious, she began experimenting. Three years ago she began selling handmade baked goods that contain no gluten, dairy or egg. To eliminate dairy, Kass uses organic extra-virgin coconut oil. She grinds flax seeds to a powder then adds water to create an egg substitute.

As the Cardinals won their second straight in this series, which will conclude this afternoon, they will be playing that finale and probably a succession of games without first baseman Lance Berkman, who suffered a recurrence of the left calf strain he sustained last week in Cincinnati.

I would not change my advice for the teacher last week, but I have a bit of advice for those who agree with the tone and tenor of your comments. No matter what you believe should happen, or what political viewpoints you have, today is still today. Today, you have a set of students that you are still charged with serving.

New York's Ronettes were a quintessential R&B girl group, groomed by producer Phil Spector, whose eight-year marriage to singer Ronnie Spector of the Ronettes ended in 1974. Maybe too much is made of the fact Ronnie Spector used to be married to Phil Spector. Granted, his “wall-of-sound” productions never sounded better than they did behind this trio from the girl-group heyday. But the appeal of the Ronettes — formed in 1959 with Estelle Bennett (vocals), Spector (vocals), Nedra Talley (vocals) — also owed much to Ronnie's remarkable voice and the sublime backing harmonies of Bennett and Talley. The group released only one studio album, "Presenting the Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica" in 1964

Fisherman's Wharf isn't as old, but has become one of the top tourist destinations in the United States. It was in 1916 that Castagnola's opened, preceded by a street-side stand selling crab and crab cocktails. The Alioto family, an important name in local politics, established their crab stand in 1925, and Sabella & LaTorre started in 1927.

It turns out that had you bought Apple stock at the end of 2011, you could have bought six iPads by mid-March.

Drawing on bills crafted by the council, on New Jersey legislation and dozens of e-mails by Christie staffers and others, The Star-Ledger found a pattern of similarities between ALEC’s proposals and several measures championed by the Christie administration. At least three bills, one executive order and one agency rule accomplish the same goals set out by ALEC using the same specific policies. In eight passages contained in those documents, New Jersey initiatives and ALEC proposals line up almost word for word. Two other Republican bills not pushed by the governor’s office are nearly identical to ALEC models.

This notion of nothingness as a fundamental condition creates a vivid tension in the book, where entropy and forgetfulness are always lapping at the edges of the stories. Nowhere is this more prevalent than in the title piece, at 85 pages more novella than short story, which revolves around Alma, an older woman in the middle stages of dementia who is an outpatient in an experimental memory clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. Set slightly in the future, in a time when memories can be recorded on small digital cartridges and played back in all their sensory lushness, the story addresses both individual and collective history, since Alma's late husband, Harold, was an amateur paleontologist. Her recollection of him "reclaiming something vital, … grappling with his own infinitesimal place in time," pushes against both her own gradual disintegration and the hard, sharp fact of Harold's death to remind us how ephemeral our grip on identity really is. "Dr. Amnesty's cartridges," Doerr writes, "the South African Museum, Harold's fossils, Chefe Carpenter's collection, Alma's memory wall — weren't they all ways of trying to defy erasure? What is memory anyway? How can it be such a frail, perishable thing?" The point is that, whether on the grand scale or the personal, it is not enough to build a firewall against the void.
Elected in November, Matakas said hed hoped the millage hike would rescue Allen Parks finances from the fiscal mess that resulted when a previous administration bought property for a movie studio, back when Michigans generous state tax credit for film production brought dozens of movie companies a year to the state.

What has happened to Greece is a bit like what happens to many of us: It borrowed too much money. But here's the infuriating part: When a new government took power in late 2009, it was discovered that there had been some creative accounting, which made the financial situation look much better than it actually was. Whether you're doing this with a country or with your spouse, it's a bad idea. Although a little spousal deception generally won't destroy your union, when a country like Greece does it, it does jeopardize a different kind of union — the European Union, of which there are 27 members and of which Greece has been a part since 1981. The agglomeration was supposed to make a strong whole.

A: I was just trying to hit every shot as best as I could. I just hit nine really bad shots on that one hole (the par-5 No. 15), so I think it is just keeping a level head about you and not letting what happened in the past influence what you are going to do in the future.

• Jonathan Okanes, San Jose Mercury News: Backup quarterback Allan Bridgford says he will be ready if called upon: Despite the presence of fifth-year senior Brock Mansion, who started the final four games of the 2010 season, Bridgford won the backup job during training camp.

There's also a lot to figure out on the line. Those 11 linemen include seven the Buckeyes can trust at this point, the three senior starters plus redshirt sophomores Corey Linsley, Jack Mewhort and Marcus Hall and true sophomore Andrew Norwell.

Bradford is the real deal. He runs the Rams’ offense and can make any throw and deliver the long ball with touch. For a young player, he runs the no-huddle offense pretty effectively. Because of the Rams’ no-huddle approach, Reed will be a key in getting the secondary set. He'll also have plenty of tricks for Bradford and might be able to come away with an interception or two.

In ancient Rome, rape of a woman was tantamount to end of any hope of honorable life and "honor killing" was considered a sympathetic act of the family members. Roman law Pater familias provided complete power to the men of the family over their children and wives. Ancient Roman Law condoned killing women who had committed adultery by their husbands. For long time in Greece, the laws provided powers to husbands over wives as women were believed to be socially below the men. In many ancient cultures including Babylonian, Egypt, Native American and Persian cultures, women convicted of infidelity were given harsh sentences. Chinese husbands would cut off the hair of wives accused of illicit relationships and crush them to death by elephants.

Solveig, Guetta, Kaskade and the other dance acts in large font on the Coachella flier make dance music that's best described as dumb and thumpy house music.

Finally, there is no denying the relative freedom of movement AQAP enjoys, compared with AQSL. Yemen has for years been a permissive environment for al-Qaida. In fact, the first al-Qaida attack took place, almost unnoticed, in Yemen in 1992, against U.S. forces transiting Yemen for Somalia. In October 2000, al-Qaida attacked the USS Cole off the coast of Aden, Yemen. In February 2006, 23 al-Qaida members — including at least one involved in the Cole attack and AQAP leader al-Wahishi — escaped from a Yemeni prison.

Gov. Mark Dayton hit the nail on the head when he spoke of "prejudice against public school teachers," but to undercut education reform will only perpetuate the problem ("Teacher-tenure veto halts a top GOP priority," May 4). Students, teachers and taxpayers have been held hostage for years by outdated, protectionist union regulations that defy common sense and damage the opportunity for students to get an education by putting bad teachers ahead of good students. No wonder the public is frustrated. Unfortunately, teachers who may not even support Education Minnesota or their PAC are forced to be members and bear the brunt of the frustration that should go to the union itself and DFL legislators. For years, the teachers union, Education Minnesota, has funded DFL campaigns, and the DFL has supported the union's stranglehold on education. Students, parents and taxpayers are completely out of the loop. Teachers may have to stand up for themselves. They do deserve better, and this reform would have opened the door for building a better future for them and their students.

Indicted Sheriff Mike Carona. Elected in 1998, "captured" Samantha Runnion's killer a few years later to become "America's Sheriff," but then it was mostly downhill. 2005 was not a great year. In 2006, he broke his promise not to run for a third term, got the GOP endorsement by one vote and avoided a run-off election by one percent. In January of 2007, I predicted in this space: "There's a 50-50 chance he won't finish his third term." Ten months later, he was indicted, along with his wife and former mistress. Trial scheduled for late October, 2008. See Debs, The; Jaramillo.

HYDRAULICS: Hydraulics and the sensation of being elevated and descending can be experienced in elevators, hospital beds and even on some wheel chairs. Since the latter two may be difficult to come by ask your friends if they know someone who lives in pet-friendly building with an elevator. Take the puppy into the elevator, offer it a treat, go up one floor and treat the whole way. Go back down treat the whole way. Repeat this process so that your puppy becomes desensitized to the hydraulic motion of the elevator. When that is achieved withhold treats until you reach the first floor. When you arrive, treat. Descend and treat when you arrive. You may also ask your vet if you can borrow one of his hydraulic tables for just this purpose. When using a hydraulic table make sure it is elevated only a few inches during each repetition. In an elevator the animal can't see objects becoming smaller as the table is lifted above them. He can on a hydraulic table, so this must be taken slowly to achieve the best results.

anything resembling Oregon's fast-paced style and the speed it presents out of the backfield.

Michigan State hung 471 yards of total offense on Wisconsin in the Big Ten championship game. Look for Oregon to produce about the same.
