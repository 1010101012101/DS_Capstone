During service, Hollingsworth and a sous chef stand at the pass - where busers pick up the food and take it to the dining room - plating food and inspecting. Beyond the main kitchen are two other rooms where the commis - paid apprentices - and stages work on their prep list. They arrive at 5 a.m. and stay until they're done, 10 to 14 hours later.

But just because you personally aren't interested doesn't mean the local story isn't worth covering. This morning's weather was unusual and dangerous. There were hundreds of accidents caused by slick roads. Did this warrant coverage until 10 a.m.? Maybe not -- but if you were trying to get out, you'd have thought so. And you might have thought it was more important than yet another political story or celebrity interview on one of the morning national "news" shows. (By the way, did you check "Good Morning America"? It often airs when the others are preempted.)
Crowder is getting warier of his many enemies and more cunning in his plans to dispose of them. He talks the whispery talk, and he walks the hands-in-pockets, rooster-in-the-barnyard walk. A scheme to rig the sheriff's election using the sister of the incumbent works beautifully, and when Quarles leaves the sheriff's office, where only minutes earlier he was happily telling the sheriff to move his stuff down the hall, Crowder is waiting with his specialty, some threatening, smoothly delivered locals vs. outsiders populism.

In 1874, Shay, a former doctor who loved things mechanical, built his first locomotive. Six years later, he sold the construction rights to Lima Machine Works, which provided Shays for virtually every logging railroad in the country. Two similar designs — the Heisler and the Climax (and Cass has examples of both) — provided competition, but not much. With their small wheels and articulation, these geared locomotives could waddle sure-footedly over improvised, ungraded track, around tight curves and up hills that traditional rigid-frame steam locomotives with large driving wheels couldn't begin to tackle. Shays are not fleet of foot, despite the frantic flailing of their vertical pistons, but they are powerful.

The bill faced constant opposition from Republicans, who wanted market-based reforms and an overhaul of federal medical malpractice liability laws. But the bill had its share of Democratic critics, too, a result of compromise that liberals saw as weakening the product.
Monday night offered a different subplot, with Angels pitcher Jered Weaver trying to become the first major leaguer since 1938 to pitch consecutive no-hitters, but that suspense ended with Erik Komatsu's third-inning single.

Impressions: I had hoped the Gentouch, with a faster processor than the Maylong tablet's, would be faster, but it's not. The touch screen may be the problem. It is slow to respond to touch, and the picture is never bright enough to properly fight off glare. Outside, it's almost unusable in the sun. This, like the Maylong tablet, feels like an unfinished product.
Kind of a slow week for wide releases at the theaters this week, except for the whole "Twilight" thing, of course. The first half of the vampire saga's final chapter hits screens this week, along with the adorable penguin of "Happy Feet Two," that being the only major release going up against the "Twilight" money-machine. Plus, "Inkubus," "The Women on the 6th Floor" and "Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone" are in limited release.

The prevailing view in the markets is that the arrest of Strauss-Kahn in New York on charges he sexually assaulted a maid in his hotel room, is unlikely to derail a euro78 billion bailout of Portugal or alter discussions about whether Greece will need any more aid, on top of last year's euro110 billion financial rescue.

A company spokesman said the indictment will not affect the label's day-to-day operations. However, sources said that if Gotti is convicted and sentenced to prison, he would no longer be able to fulfill the terms of his employment contract and Def Jam would then have the option to buy Gotti's half of The Inc. and take over the label, which has sold more than 20 million albums since opening as Murder Inc. in 1997.

Just as people have grown understandably indisposed toward anything political, Clooney directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in the election drama "The Ides of March." Rather than play the candidate any number of people wish he were (Clooney says he's not interested in actually running for office), the actor's "Ides of March" presidential contender is about as honorable as John Edwards. And while starring in an Alexander Payne movie might initially appear risk-free, the film's cuckolded protagonist is not necessarily the type of character Clooney's peers would fight to play, and it proved to be a part Clooney said concerned him no end. "I was terrified from the moment it started," he says.

But it never seems to come easy. The scenario this time was nearly a carbon copy of the outcome Monday, when the Blues scored in the third period to win 1-0. This time, they waited even longer to hit a vein, getting Alex Pietrangelo's goal with 5:14 remaining in regulation. All the nice home records aside, Blues coach Ken Hitchcock realizes his team is skating a fine line.

I'm so completely devastated right now. I hadn't seen him in such a long time. I asked, 'Junior, how's it going? He said everything was going great.'
Hitchcock believes parity is part of the predicament. The competitive table has never been more level in hockey. The difference between first-place and eighth-place teams in the Western Conference was 16 points; in the East, it was 17 points. The difference might be explained by injuries or sub-par stretches of performance. The differences might have been caulked with late-season trades. The differences can be incomprehensible in the playoffs, and anything seems possible.

They did it with hip-hop that was both aggressively political and unrepentantly commercial. The Fugees could speak for the underclass and then turn around and repackage the Roberta Flack hit “Killing Me Softly” into a radio-ready showcase for Hill’s emerging voice. “Fu-Gee-La,” a massive hit, wedded references to Louis Farrakhan and crack babies (among many other things) to a hook lifted from a featherweight Teena Marie song. The group sampled or otherwise reinterpreted music by Enya, Afrika Bambaataa, Kenny Rogers and French protest crooner Michel Sardou. All contradictions were steamrollered by the group’s irresistible choruses, which drew from classic soul, reggae and cheesy ’60s pop as well as throwback positive rap.

The biggest example of Steeler bias showed through when Florida scatback and special-teams ace Chris Rainey was taken at No. 159.

All of the drawbacks vanished when the Steelers came calling. Rainey instantly became a multi-talented weapon who automatically will "fall in line."

Cellist Maya Beiser is a worldly creature — raised in Israel to a French mother and Argentine father, Yale-educated, then a founding member of genre-blurring New York ensemble Bang On a Can All-Stars. For her sixth solo release, she commissioned 15-minute works for cello, oud and percussion from the Iranian Kayhan Kalhor (“I Was There,” characteristically intense) and Israeli Tamar Muskal (“Mar de Leche,” with a Sephardic vocal by Etty Ben Zaken) plus solo pieces from Armenian icon Djivan Gasparian (the haunted “Memories”) and American Douglas Cuomo. A voluptuous sadness binds the music, underscored by Beiser’s natural feel for the keening cantabile of Middle Eastern music. Her Bang on a Can compatriot Evan Ziporyn’s East-meets-West arrangement of Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” (for multi-tracked cello and drums) serves as a dramatic encore.

The iTraxx Crossover, an index tracking the cost of insuring 40 mostly sub-investment-grade European corporate borrowers against default, acts as a good barometer of investors' sentiment.

Champagne flutes highlight the bubbles but somewhat mute the wine's aromas, as they leave little room to swirl the glass or smell the wine. A white wineglass will reduce the fizz somewhat more quickly, but also heightens the aromas, as it allows you to better smell the wine.

"Gods Without Men" takes its title from Balzac: "In the desert, you see, there is everything and nothing… It is God without men." Kunzru uses this as an epigraph, but its influence, I think, is more profound.

Protect your fruit trees from sunscald. It is not uncommon for midwinter's grip to ease long enough to allow sap to rise. When temperatures drop again to freezing, the tree cambium dies on the exposed west side, halting the passage of water and nutrients where the cambium has been damaged. Cover the first couple of feet of your fruit trees' trunks with a tree wrap or white exterior latex paint with a bubble wrap cover, or use pipe insulation to keep the cold at bay.

Answer: I think the significant part about what Secretary Gates has put on the table and what we have executed is not necessarily a cut of the defense budget but rather taking a look at our budget and then challenging the services to reinvest or realign. I welcome that. And for the Navy it's important because we're heavily involved ashore in the Middle East, in Iraq, Afghanistan. We have 14,500 sailors ashore, more than the about 10,000 we have at sea. Many of those sailors ashore come from San Diego and commands around San Diego. That's about the same amount of sailors that we have committed to the fight as the Marine Corps has committed to the fight. That said, we still believe that because of our global interests, the Western Pacific and the Indian Ocean/Arabian Gulf region require continued attention and continued presence and that we in the Navy are the force that best provides that presence and that attention. And we've stayed true to that even as we're dealing with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And what we have been able to do is to take that opportunity for realignment and reinvestment and address some of the structure issues and capability issues that allow us to, I think, better provide that presence and better provide the nation with options in those important parts of the world.

The Sept. 21 and 22 shows at MetLife Stadium conflict with another major music event taking place in the Garden State that weekend: All Tomorrow's Parties in Asbury Park.

In recent years when Dick Clark would appear on his "Rockin' New Years Eve" on ABC-TV to count down to midnight with his protege Ryan Seacrest, there were some who felt Mr. Clark shouldn't be on television any more, even for a brief moment. Slowed by a stroke he had suffered in 2004, Clark had great difficulty speaking and was sometimes almost unintelligible. "America's Oldest Living Teenager" was now a frail old man, and some viewers felt uncomfortable with the juxtaposition of Mr. Clark's appearance and the giddy, youthful, here's-to-the-future vibe of Times Square on New Year's Eve.

Marriage is a sacred commitment and is already in the dumper in this country which mocks God with divorce rates of 60 to 70 percent — even in so-called Christian households. How much do you think it will be respected if you allow those who are unable to understand cleaving together as a sacred rite rather than an immoral act of fornication? If the bill before the Maryland General Assembly is passed then there will be no way that a man should not be able to marry his best friend Fido, or his mother-in-law or even a pedophile to marry a young boy or girl.

WASHINGTON -- Here's a question that has probably never been uttered, courtesy of Iowa Rep. Steve King:

Pakistan once kept Indian generals awake at night.

• Bob Condotta, Seattle Times: Sunday practice notes: rankly, there's not a lot to report. Everything personnel-wise seemed status quo. What stuck out the most was the play of quarterback Keith Price. He won't be 100 percent for the Alamo Bowl --- it's best to realize now that likely won't happen until he has some rest and real time to heal after the season (and maybe a little procedure along the way). But he looked great throwing the ball and running around a little better than he has most of the season.

"The Bengals blew it with their draft. They could have had DeCastro and Kendall Wright. Instead, they drafted needs more than talents. Kirkpatrick is nothing special. Zeitler as well. DeCastro will be making pro bowl year after year and the Bengals chose Zeitler instead...and they had the opportunity to add an absolutely dynamic receiver next to Green, but they chose to draft the average corner in Kirkpatrick and then take Sanu later to make up for it. Kendall Wright is on a whole different level than Sanu.

McKinnie, I can't really figure out. Sometimes he looks really good, and other times, he struggles with speed rushers. I thought his conditioning would be his biggest weakness this year, but really it's his lateral quickness. (They could still be related.) The fact that neither LaMarr Woodley nor James Harrison will likely be 100 percent next week (if they play at all) is a fortunate break for Baltimore.

It seems unlikely. But ReshapeOhio.org seemingly could give interested Ohioans, if not a seat at the drawing table, at least their best opportunity yet to understand (and critique) what up to now has been, de facto, a private Statehouse undertaking. That is, ReshapeOhio.org should offer Ohioans a way to at least judge what state officials propose. That could be a powerful check and a potent balance.

Jhoulys Chacin (11-14, 3.62 ERA in 2011) did not have a strong spring, slowed initially by biceps tendinitis and later by a blister on his right index finger. Both compromised his velocity. He ended the spring reaching 92 mph on the radar gun, with impressive sink. For Chacin, a quick start is imperative after he closed last season with a 4.58 ERA after June 21. April is his best month (2.83 ERA), and he has held the Giants to a .211 average in seven games. Barry Zito (3-4, 5.87) is a shell of the pitcher who won a Cy Young. He's changed positioning to the first-base side of the rubber, but does not have much variance between his 83- to 85-mph fastball and other pitches. Troy E. Renck, The Denver Post

But the timing is perilous. It's 1857 - on the brink of the Civil War. In the book's first half, the settlers build up Daybreak and interact with one another - usually generously, sometimes licentiously, occasionally violently. In these chapters, Wiegenstein spells out the challenges that idealism faces with human nature on the frontier. An example:
In a time of great financial and political uncertainty and budget cuts at all governmental levels looming, public-private partnerships become even more important to the city's future. Private investors require the certainty of an engaged, committed public-sector partner. A coherent community development vision of program and fiscal priorities and a structure to see them through would provide the sense of certainty that gives confidence to local government's essential allies and investors: neighborhoods, major educational and cultural institutions, businesses, and private developers from here and across the country. It's time to hear the candidates' plans for Baltimore's neighborhoods.

Obama is going to the Chrysler plant "to help again underscore and help people understand the amount of restructuring that happened," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Politico today.
