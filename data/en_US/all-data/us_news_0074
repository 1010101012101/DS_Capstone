In Washington, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the decision to name Saeed had been in the works for months and wasn't related to NATO supplies but rather was because he'd helped plan the four-day assault on Mumbai, in which 166 people were killed, including six American citizens.

"The pika is the tip of the iceberg," he said. "Scientists are saying if global warming continues on this track, there are more extinctions coming. I don't think that most people are willing to accept that."
But together, we are moving in the right direction. And to the cynical birds in the rafters who would like to dismiss Baltimore's achievements across three mayoral administrations as merely part of a national trend, think again. If you think smarter policing, better drug treatment options, youth interventions and sufficient public funding don't matter, just look at Newark, Trenton or other cities where crime is rising.
All future speculation aside, a BIG thank you deserved for Darron Thomas! He came in as a first-year starter and led the Ducks to the National Championship game, gained the respect of his teammates, rarely turned the ball over, and won back-to-back conference championships. He ran the offense great and was a good leader. Thank you Darron and good luck!
Expected or not, the old and new math calculating high school graduates is jarring. Given that the topic involves education, it’s easy and natural for any former student to equate the graduation rate with a classroom grade. It’s an unfair analogy, to be sure, but psychologically an 81 percent, a “B,” is a lot easier to collectively stomach than the “D” represented by a 67.4.
They also argue the approach will prove cheaper for the state in the long run because Illinois will pay less in interest through Wall Street than it's now paying to providers as a penalty for falling behind. Those the state owes now get 1 to 2 percent in interest for each month payments are late after the first 60 days.

Groomer Sheri Harvey of Sheri's Pampered Pets in Chester Township, N.J., says few owners take her up on the offer to put a star, flower, rainbow or other design on their pet. That's because many pet owners are unfamiliar with the practice and are fearful the dyes could injure their pets, Harvey says.
More broadly, this budget also proposes an increase of over $28 million above last year for student financial assistance, the bulk of which is a 10% increase in funding for tuition aid grants.

One of the biggest clues that we were well matched was at his friend's backyard party in Westchester onNew Year's Eve. We were the only two not embracing at midnight. We were too busy shooting video of the festivities with our iPhones; he worked one end of the party and I worked the other. When he saw me on his screen and I saw him on mine as our camera pans met, we looked up, giggled at our geeky selves and finally kissed.
Ashtabula — In the shadow of hulking factories, gritty mounds of coal line this city’s harbor. The steel-gray winter sky touches a blue-gray Lake Erie on the horizon. A deserted and decaying train depot serves as a constant reminder of the hardship that failure can bring.
After being with her and her family for awhile, they suggested that the two of us go to Municipal Stadium to see the doubleheader between the Tigers and the Indians. Looking back, maybe her parents had already made decisions about my involvement with their family -- get him out of the house.
I've written about it several times on my blog and in the newspaper, and I've been to the restaurant a dozen times, but I've never written a formal review. It was an oversight on my part, or maybe subconsciously I wanted to have enough ammunition before I jumped into the line of fire.

Headquartered in Houston, Midstates was founded in 1993 and focuses on oilfields in Louisiana that were discovered by major oil companies in the 1940s and 1950s, but were not fully developed due to the price of oil, state taxes and regulatory limitations.

The red light spun in silence. From one bench, the white-sweatered crew poured onto the ice in celebration, basking in the silence of a beaten crowd and a broken night. From the other, a string of blue shirts stepped on, some of them bent at the waist as if they’d been stricken by a sudden case of food poisoning.
Bird flu is lethal more than half of the time it strikes humans. It is also very hard for humans to catch. Most people who have developed bird flu have been in close contact with infected birds; only a few have gotten sick from very close contact with infected people. But virologists and public health officials have worried that the virus might have the potential to mutate so that it could pass more easily between humans, through droplets in the air.
It took firefighters about five minutes to bring the blaze under control, House said. No firefighters were injured.
Even with the gains, there is heavy competition for each available opening. With 12.8 million people unemployed, there are on average 3.66 people out of work for each open position. That's much better than the nearly 7-to-1 ratio that existed in July 2009, just after the recession ended. But it's worse than the 2-to-1 ratio that is more common in a healthy economy.
So I have a public service announcement to people currently parenting our future workforce: Remind your children early and often that it's not all about them. That other races, religions, physical abilities, sexual orientations and just plain different ways of looking at the world exist.
Nicholas Stoller directs and re-teams with Jason Segel on the script -- the pair worked together on the superior "Forgetting Sarah Marshall." In another Judd Apatow production, they try to mine a similar vein -- call it the profane romantic comedy. But here, the story drags on too long, and it's not as inspired to begin with. Segel stars as Tom, half of the couple who can't seal the deal, and Emily Blunt plays Violet, his fiancée. Segel is a warm-and-fuzzy presence in everything he's in, and Blunt is delightful. Some bits are funny, some vulgar, some sweet.

The agreement "does not commit the United States to any specific troop levels or levels of funding in the future," said a senior Obama administration official who briefed reporters in return for anonymity.

There was enough evidence to arrest Cuevas. But the goal was to expand the investigation, and that required resuming the phone surveillance. Agents hoped Cuevas had thrown away the numbers of some -- even one -- of the 30 new cellphones he had just distributed to his crew.
"This should have been investigated outside the city of Florissant because they're going to be biased," Menefee said.
The world's second-most-populous Muslim country is caught in a brutal internal struggle between extremism and moderation. Most of its people tell pollsters they don't like the United States and wish we'd go away. The tribesmen of its western frontier shelter Osama bin Laden and the leaders of Afghanistan's Taliban. And the United States can't forget how, in the 1980s, Pakistan built nuclear weapons -- and then later exported nuclear technology to North Korea and Iran.

SATURDAY, OCT. 23
At 5:15 a.m., we stepped out near the top, 9,740 feet above sea level, and into a parking lot crowded with hundreds of bundled-up tourists, a dawn of 40-degree gusts, numb digits, swirling clouds and volcanic moonscape, all of which erupted in golden light when the sun hurled its first beams at us from the horizon. Locals note that many winter sunrises are rain-soaked and cloud-bound, but this one was well worth the early wake.

Abazab: The company, backed by venture firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson among others, offers a ``Playbox'' media player for storing video clips. Users can embed Playbox clips to their MySpace pages. However, MySpace's recent upgrades, which force users to adopt a new Flash technology, have turned Abazab's Playboxes ``wonky,'' the site complains, so users must re-install their Playboxes to fix the problem.

“I don’t know that I can just concentrate on certain facts,” he said.
Bobbie Williams (Cincinnati): The Ravens know all about Williams, having gone up against the former Bengal the past eight seasons. Williams is huge (6-4, 345 pounds) and he’s long been considered a pretty good run blocker. However, there are a lot of question marks with him as well, and there has even been some speculation that he could retire. He’s 36 years old and he played in only nine games last year. He was suspended for four games for violating the league’s policy against performance-enhancing substances, and then he sustained a broken ankle in early December. He’d certainly be a short-term solution.

But as rewarding as these difference-making moments are for Greer, who has been with the Blazers for four seasons, the life of an advance scout can be equally grueling. Greer, who lives in Ohio with his wife and three children, sees his family about five days a month on average during the NBA season. He's with the team eight days a month and the rest of his time is spent in hotel rooms, airplanes, airports and basketball arenas.
Will 2012 finally be the year when the camera industry settles on one name for a common next-generation style of camera? They'd better get hopping. These new cameras could kill off the consumer SLR by 2013. The idea is to combine the most desirable features of an SLR (a large image sensor for superior photos and low-light performance, interchangeable lenses) and a compact (slides easily into a jacket pocket). Sometimes they're called "mirrorless compacts" and other times they're "compact interchangeable-lens cameras."

That the elimination of food deserts is not as effective as once hoped for has been well-researched.

It is depressing that supporters of Second Amendment rights seldom if ever mention the frequent tragedies, such as the recent killing of the 13-year old girl in Baltimore.

A coat comes from the ceiling, I put on my tails, a hat comes from the audience and a man throws me my cane, and I go crazy and have a good time. And then my thoughts come back for the bow. And the bow is really silly. "I love bowing. I'm no Scott Hamilton, but I'm not bad." And it's a really fun program to do. I love props and I love hats. I'm addicted to them.

It is illegal to use state campaign funds, regulated under Ohio law, for a federal campaign, regulated under federal law. Simply put, if you want to run for Ohio dog catcher (a fictional post), you must follow Ohio law, and if you then decide to run for Congress -- or even just want to consider such a run -- you must file paperwork with the FEC, start a federal account and steer clear of mingling the money you raised running for dog catcher. The law keeps candidates from doing an end-run around federal campaign funding restrictions.

It was around that time that Los Gatos locals who had seen him dining with his family in prior years saw him instead partying at the bars. With a restricted driver's license from a 2010 drunken driving arrest, an armed body guard who doubled as a driver escorted him around town. He would often mix water with $200 bottles of Silver Oak cabernet. He was kicked out of at least one bar and at times could get loud and argue with other patrons, said Pete Jillo, a friend and owner of Gardino Fresco on Santa Cruz Avenue. But he had a big heart, Jillo said, ﻿and was a generous philanthropist. He even bought paintings from a local homeless man.

President Obama is fond of blaming his troubles on an obstructionist Congress, though he had massive majorities in both houses for two years — and the reason the House of Representatives now opposes him is simply because it was ordered to do so by the same voters he believes wanted him to go even further down the path he was heading.

I remember very little about the fainting experience. Again this experience might teach one to expect the unexpected.

Most oil-packed tuna in the U.S. is packed in soybean oil. Going back a few decades, somebody whispered to someone else that oil adds unnecessary fat and calories, so many people choose tuna in water. That's not a bad idea, according to the American Institute for Cancer Research. It notes that albacore tuna has the most healthy omega-3s of any canned tuna. Because oil and water do not mix, they also remain better in the fish so are less apt to be drained away in other oil. Four major health organizations recommend eating seafood twice a week for the benefits of omega-3s.

Standard lyrical fare is less strong, with Grigolo’s tone sometimes shallow or nasal.

This work gives me everything. It has given me a real reason to live. I have goals for the animals that sometimes seem insurmountable. I've been able to get one federal bill passed in Washington to stop the interstate traffic of big cats. I co-authored the bill and took it to my congressmen. I don't know how anyone can have lions and tigers as pets. They are predators. Our government says it's OK to breed these animals and sell them. My goal is to get a billed passed to stop the breeding. So many adults and children are either killed or injured by these animals. It's totally our fault.

The law also requires the power companies to help customers slash electrical consumption by adopting energy efficiency measures, from new lighting technology to appliances to high-efficiency motors, pumps and the like used in industry.
Mattaliano's opera fundamentalism overcame his deficits as a newbie general director. He may have been the least qualified candidate being considered to lead Portland Opera when Robert Bailey retired in 2003. An itinerant stage director at Juilliard, Yale, Princeton, the Metropolitan and New York City Opera companies for 25 years, he knew stages, not boardrooms. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of opera -- call him an opera savant -- but his only experience leading a company was a small summer music festival on Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Then Tulo laughed hard enough to bust a slump, if not a gut.
When crunched metal wasn't taking drivers out, blown engines were spoiling the day. The setups didn't allow cars to be engaged for very long without overheating issues, a situation that became exacerbated following morning showers.

In talks last month, the open space district said it is considering giving the PUC an easement on Ravenswood property to lay down water pipes from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in exchange for land to build the Bay Trail. Such a project would be combined with Fish and Wildlife restoration and could be completed in four years.

Lake Hopatcong boaters, swimmers and anglers share the water with a sea monster nicknamed Hoppie. Although the creature is regarded as a friendly inhabitant, there was a panic in 1894, when fishermen first noticed something lurking in the lake. The monster was described as 40 feet long, with the head of a canine and the body of a snake, "as thick as a man's leg." The archived news story includes quotes from doubters who suggested that the behemoth was probably a floating beer keg.

Wisconsin, the third, is likely to be the next big showdown.

As a canoeist, you have to take their word for it, because when you're gliding along the surface you rarely actually see fish. DNR researchers learn what's going on with them by electrifying the water with powerful electric wands. That stuns the fish and causes them to float to the surface to be cataloged (before recovering and swimming away).
"We've talked with our guys about (the ranking), and we've told them it's a heck of an honor for them and the school," coach Kevin Walsh said, "but I think the way we maintain the focus of it all is just when we go to practice we're trying to get ready for our next opponent. Our guys have been really good. It's a senior group who has been through some really good times and been through some struggles. So I think they understand that rankings don't mean very much, at least right now they don't."

The Rock Creek Campus, named "Recycler of the Year" by the Association of Oregon Recyclers in 2008, is known for its vermi-composting system, which has brought students and community members together to integrate recycling into the curriculum of several academic programs. Its Loop Program consists of students growing cafeteria food in the community garden, thanks to the vermi-composting of cafeteria food scraps, which eventually become nutrient-rich worm castings that enrich garden's soil. This practice creates a closed-loop system the heart of sustainable practice. Thanks to students' hard work, vegetables grown from the community garden are harvested for the cafeteria and the Oregon Food Bank.

At that point, Rutgers was still a fledgling Big East team, trying to come back from a 1-5 start. Then Mike Teel went on an aerial assault, throwing for 361 yards and six touchdowns in Pittsburgh. Kenny Britt finished with 143 yards and three touchdowns.

Actually, though I agree Boozer has lacked some explosiveness this season, I think he finished the year very well. He was very aggressive in that Knicks game and while he did bobble some shots and passes, players talked about the ball being slick that game. Also, he's been consistently drawing double-teams and finding the open man. I don't think he gets enough credit for his passing. As the Bulls like to say, that's easy offense.

“The decision to revert to section 528 status is a result of the IRS' scrutiny of tax-exempt homeowners associations, including GRF,” says the community's board of directors in a prepared statement. “Both the IRS and the courts have focused on gated communities and have more consistently ruled that restricting access to the common areas does not satisfy the requirements for tax-exempt status.

øSince not all student loans participate in IBR or loan forgiveness, you could certainly ask your lender about a graduated payment. Graduated payments result in a lower payment for a pre-determined amount of time, but the payments will eventually increase. This could make sense if you felt something will change in your financial situation. Make sure to ask the lender in advance what your payment will be when it increases, because it will be necessary to have the income to meet this payment further down the road.

On a recent afternoon at Tecate's Asao Restaurante, sunlight glinted on the goblets of excellent vintages from nearby Adobe Guadalupe winery. Lunch was an indulgence of contemporary Mexican cuisine, combining local ingredients and classic Mexican flavors with international influences and avant-garde techniques. On my plate, slices of house-cured tuna carpaccio, festively garnished with a confetti mix of diced jicama, pineapple and red onion, were topped with an avocado sorbet that delighted my taste buds with its smooth iciness.
