For the past 20 years, we've read about sexual abuse in the Catholic Church and how it protected the perpetrators instead of the parishioners. In South Baltimore, a Catholic middle school teacher, John Merzbacher, violated students — sometimes at gunpoint. During school. Other teachers (i.e., nuns) saw him smacking students and grabbing boys' bottoms, heard him calling boys "faggots" and girls "rotten crotches." No adult did anything, until 20 years later when some of those students grew into adults who bravely joined together to take legal action. They couldn't all be there — some became addicts, some were too terrified, and others had committed suicide. The church did not lift a ringed finger to help the victims. In criminal court, Mr. Merzbacher received a life sentence plus 10 years. The statute of limitations protected the church.

Preparation H's main active ingredient, phenylephrine, temporarily constricts blood vessels in the skin. Constriction shrinks hemorrhoids -- which are really inflamed, engorged veins -- by squeezing some blood and fluid back into circulation. Something similar happens under your eyes.

And don't use the cream too often; overdoing blood-vessel constrictors can prompt "rebound congestion." (Just ask anyone who's overused a sinus product.)

The plantation remained in the Levy (pronounced "levee") family for 89 years.

There's good evidence that midlife women with the most youthful-looking skin (fewer wrinkles, thinning and dryness) also have the most vitamin C in their diets. Makes sense, since vitamin C builds collagen, the support structure that keeps your skin's surface smooth. Young-looking women also tend to eat less fat and fewer carbs, and have higher levels of linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid found mainly in nuts and dark, leafy greens (think spinach, kale).

The Blue Springs grad hadn’t underestimated his opponents — it’s hard to do that at the U.S. Olympic Trials — but he did expect to win the 264½ weight class, despite being the fourth seed.

Drinks are strong; the wine list is not. Why was Saint-Émilion Grand Cru, Chateau Plaisance, from the fine year 2005, only $65? “I wondered myself,” said the sommelier, who admitted he hadn’t tasted it. He should have. The unripe product was short on bouquet, complexity and interest.

As we learn, Megan's youthful perfection isn't lost on Betty. Further not helping is another example of that "Mad Men" staple, toxic mothering. In this case, it's Betty's new mother-in-law, Pauline, who reminds her that Henry doesn't like it when Betty doesn't go with him to events. Rather than sit around on the coach chowing down on a jumbo bag of Bugles, why doesn't Betty do something about the fact that she's gotten too...""comfortable," as Pauline says. "There are pills you can take."

In the end, talent tends to prevail. And Brown has the talent. It is easy to say he struggled during his 56-game stint in the majors last season, but his .245 average was exactly the same as the one posted by the 16-year veteran the Phillies started in leftfield. His .333 on-base percentage was 44 points higher. He walked more often, struck out less often and hit home runs right around the average MLB rate. Plenty of prospects have earned themselves extended looks with performances equal or worse. And plenty of those prospects have moved on to enjoy considerable big-league success.

"You always know that once a player has an opportunity to go out in the free-agent market, you're afraid that somebody is going to throw enough money at him. The Angels were in position to get one of the best and they realized they had to shovel a lot of money out there. Albert, in the end, is a businessman. I think everybody would have liked for him to stay here but (the Cardinals) couldn't afford him, so we just wish him well. I just hope people don't start booing him or disliking him just because he moved on. He gave us 11 great years and two world championships. You wish him well and you just watch him from afar."

Lakers get Howard, Antawn Jamison and his expiring contract -- a good stretch four with Howard -- and Sessions, a penetrating guard to work pick and rolls with Howard and Kobe.

New Jersey statutes and state Department of Education policy are quite clear about a school district’s responsibility for children afflicted with any disability, including a life-threatening food allergy.

Ding's "Still Life" is something like a room-size painting, but one in which black, white and green painted passages take turns with bright vertical and horizontal fluorescent lights. The work occupies the whole of the Sculpture Center's more formal, windowless interior gallery, and the effect is by turns soothing and slightly unsettling.
Local governments and school districts spend millions of dollars on insurance for health care, property, liability and worker’s compensation. But unlike most municipal contracts, the purchase of insurance is exempt from competitive bidding requirements, and most brokers are not covered by pay-to-play laws because they are under contract to the insurance companies, not the local governments. As a result, insurance contracting throughout the state has been rife with corruption, influenced by political power brokers and largely devoid of healthy competition among firms.

Seek out portion options. More and more places are offering full, appetizer and "tasting" servings. Ask. See whether half-portions (especially for pasta dishes) are available. Don't be shy about inquiring about senior or children's menu options. If none of these options is available, consider building your meal from options offered on the starters menu. Sometimes a modest appetizer along with a salad and a roll is all you want.

Chen's case overshadowed Thursday's opening of a two-day U.S.-China summit that included Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. Both sides were careful not to mention Chen's case specifically. But Chen managed to thrust himself into the center of the stage-managed diplomacy when he told interviewers that he wanted to fly to the United States with Clinton when she leaves Saturday. U.S. officials and analysts, however, said privately that that appeared unlikely.

New Jersey laws on sick pay are crazy. In the private sector, sick pay protects us from losing income when we are ill.

Beavers fans should be excited because: This a four-sport athlete who has been clocked at 4.4 seconds in the 40. He could bulk up and turn into a wickedly-fast outside linebacker. “I’d have to get in the weight room, but that would be fine with me,’’ said Robinson. … Sequoyah coach Brent Scott says Robinson was woefully under-recruited. His stats were well off his spectacular junior season, "because other teams weren't going to let Zack beat them.'' ... some bigger schools questioned Robinson's size, smaller schools figured he was too good to consider them. … “I figured wherever I went, I was going to show everybody that I was a player,’’ said Robinson. … Scott said when Oregon State coaches came through the hallways to see Robinson, “we had to tell everybody this Orange and Black wasn’t Oklahoma State.’’ … Robinson – initially recruited by departed OSU assistant Keith Heyward - was a difference maker on both sides of the ball in high school. OSU coaches may initially use him at safety and on special teams. … Robinson runs the 100, 200, 4x100 and high jumps in track and wouldn’t mind participating on the Beavers’ track team if he’s allowed. … Scott on Robinson: “He’s got so much upside. He’s very fast, great change of direction with that ‘burst’ college coaches look for. We couldn’t get him the ball enough. He was one of the best (3A) players in the state on offense and was the best defensive player in 3A. … I think he was a steal. He got stolen out of the state of Oklahoma. A lot of coaches have sat in my office and said the same thing, that he’s the one that got away.’’ … Robinson visited the OSU campus last weekend, and solidified his commitment even though he was disappointed that Heyward had jumped to the Washington Huskies’ staff. “Of course it came as bad news, because he was the one who pushed me to (come to OSU),’’ said Robinson. “It was hard when he left.’’

I recently wrote about the shooting death of a teenager who was called "Little Bill." He wasn't a small kid. So why the nickname? Because he had joined a gang at the age of 10 and the older gang members - kids in their teens - called him "Little Bill." The name stuck.

My father was a health and physical education instructor who tried, usually in vain, to get several of his own couch-potato children to make better food choices and to exercise more.

Miami's ascent into the national consciousness began in the '50s and '60s, when entertainers Arthur Godfrey and Jackie Gleason, broadcasting from the South Florida city, promoted it as the world's top sun and fun playground.

Some modern spiders still build their orb webs using the primitive cribellate silk, however. That has caused researchers to wonder whether the ancestors of those spiders, and the ancestors of spiders that make orb webs using gluey capture silk, each independently came up with the idea for orb webs. Blackledge's research has ruled that out. The orb web evolved only once, he and his team found, and after it did, spiders proliferated.

They settled in St. Louis, and eventually his major-league career caught up with them. Released in 1998 after being a regular for Milwaukee, Mike played with Toronto in 1999. Released by the Blue Jays, he signed with the Cardinals for 2000.
Also, do not underestimate what happens when you haven't eaten in a while. Baumeister cites a research study of an Israeli tribunal deciding on whether to parole prisoners.
