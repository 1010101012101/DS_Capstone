◆ What other time consuming commitments do you, your partner or your other children have? For instance, are you part of the sandwich generation caring for elderly parents while also caring for your young children? Do you have other responsibilities that take up a lot of your time that would severely limit the time you have to commit to a new baby? Time is one commodity that is impossible to get back.

On Iran, the president kept a campaign promise to seek negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program, which made hawks nervous; but so far, the main product of "engagement" has been stronger economic sanctions, which have quieted criticism from the right (except from a few super-hawks who favor pre-emptive U.S. military action). Now, Obama needs to catch a break on timing. Most estimates are that Iran is at least two years away from developing a nuclear weapon. If Iran buckles under economic sanctions and proposes a deal, Obama will face tough scrutiny from the right over the terms of any compromise, but that's a problem he'd be glad to face. In the unlikely event Iran succeeds in making a bomb before the election, that will become the greatest crisis of the Obama presidency, and his performance will define him in the eyes of voters.
Glenn said he notified a police officer, who recovered the machete.

In that game, Glencoe jumped out to a 10-4 first-quarter lead and led 16-9 midway through the second quarter. But things came apart for Glencoe at the beginning of the second half when it didn't hit a field goal until there was less than two minutes left in the third quarter.

With Elizabeth donning four such get-ups per episode, most girded with corsets and hoops, the demands of dressing her have shaped the show. Mr. Fontana, the show's co-creator, says he has rewritten scripts—consolidating scenes and merging two days of action into one, for example—to reduce the number of Elizabeth's costume changes. "If we do two less, it looks like we didn't spend enough money," he says. "But at some point you have to say, this is enough costumes in the course of an hour."

Once the digital-music revolution gave us the ability to buy single songs (or, too often, to steal them), we took control of how we consume music, rejecting albums and upending the music industry. Once the DVR gave us the ability to find TV shows easily and record them without fussing with videocassettes, we started watching when we pleased, stopped caring which network a show belonged to and skipped through the ads that pay for free TV. (And if we missed something, we looked for a streaming clip online the next day.) Once the Web let us find and read news whenever we wanted to, we turned our back on print papers and the evening news, replacing them with a patchwork of stories derived from a dizzying number of sources, some of which didn't exist just a few years ago.

If students get used to a pat on the arm or a squeeze to the shoulder from a favorite teacher, they may come to accept touches from those who aren't safe. As adults we know how to reject unwanted physical advances, but some young people can't imagine setting boundaries with someone in a position of authority, especially someone they look up to or even admire. They might believe that being touched is the price they pay for interest and attention from a grown-up.

But I got a little upset when I realized it because I remember thinking back to the very beginning of the pregnancy when I was happy and getting excited for all the fun things to come. It's so frivolous in the whole grand scheme of things: the shower, and preparing the nursery, and getting excited about sonograms; but, they are all things I looked forward to when imagining myself pregnant. Now all I want are my babies.

I've answered this question in other places and at other times. I've recently decided, however, to stop answering it. If the only question you have after listening to me defend my family is about my sexuality, I'm afraid you've missed my point. Whether I'm gay, straight, or bisexual, tall or short, male or female, white or black, successful go-getter or slacker, is entirely immaterial. I happen to be a go-getter student-turned-activist speaking out in defense of his moms, but this isn't-and shouldn't be-the norm. Nobody wants to spend all of his or her time defending his family, and I'm looking forward to mine no longer needing defending.

The prepared food department is called "Classic Kitchen." A charming, 17-year Kings veteran named Dave really wants to make us happy. He's proud of his products, makes lots of suggestions and wants us to try everything. There's obviously a strong training program here; everyone we talk to in all departments knows their products and can even give you cooking tips. Kings goes the extra mile with a label on precooked products listing every ingredient, a considerate move for customers with dietary issues. As a chain, King's gets a bad rap for being expensive, but since we're only talking fresh foods (we didn't look at dry products), I have to disagree; they are extremely competitive.

Three other debuts also failed to make serious dents at the box office. "The Pirates! Band of Misfits," a 3-D stop-motion animated picture, started off with a slightly better $11.4 million _ though it cost about $30 million more to produce than "Engagement." The Jason Statham action flick "Safe," meanwhile, grossed an unimpressive $7.7 million, roughly as much as the lackluster $7.3 million that the John Cusack horror film "The Raven" opened with.

Since it owns and operates the Rutgers Athletic Center, there are no sharing agreements on concessions or parking or the total gate. For example, when the Orange traveled to Louisville last Monday, the Cardinals sold out the KFC Yum! Center in downtown Louisville. But because the Louisville Arena Authority owns the building, the university does not keep every penny earned off the game.

"Have you been to the oil and vinegar store?� already sounds like a joke. And a subsequent visit to the Tasteful Olive in downtown Overland Park reveals the shop is even more specialized than that. The oils are all olive, the vinegars all balsamic. But what a lot of them! The tasting-room setup means all the fresh stone-milled oils are displayed in shiny stainless steel fustis, or storage tanks with spigots on the front. Next to each fusti is a stack of thimble-sized pleated paper tasting cups that you can use to taste oils from seven countries and California. Among the vinegars, which are all from Modena, Italy, black cherry balsamic and coconut white balsamic are standouts. There also are three wine vinegars: red, champagne and sherry.
Whatever your opinion on innerwear as outerwear, Quevedo provided a jolt of adrenaline to the runway at the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel downtown.

Emerging in the 1960s, the environmental movement taught limits, especially the limits of technology. There is no such thing as a technological fix.

The founding of the association is another step by members of Colorado's broad medical-cannabis community in recent months to cast a mainstream light on what had for years been an in-the-shadows business. A group of medical-marijuana patients and dispensary owners in Boulder County have formed a similar group. Advocates have begun to lobby state lawmakers for regulations to better define and protect the industry.

California Restaurant Association bigwigs were disgusted, too, and alarmed. What if a similar stunt happened here? It could devastate their members, already pounded by the recession. They also worried that local health officials might react, creating a hodgepodge of different food worker rules across the state.

The menu is compact, so there are only six big plates, six starters, and five soups and salads, all prodigious and well executed. Like many menus, the categories are a loose network that allows diners to mix and match. The Tipsy sliders ($12) listed as a starter, for example, would be a substantial main course. The slightly sweet and sensually squishy Hawaiian sweet buns are piled with pulled pork braised in Chimay ale, with a crown of red cabbage slaw. They're rich, gooey and wonderful.

In this one, Wheating began a strong surge at the 200-meter mark, accelerated at 150 and powered all the way through finish line to win in 1:45.69. He left Andrews too much ground to make up, although the Virginia freshman did close hard to finish second in 1:46.83.
"I think there's some value to that," he said. "It's one of those times when you're trying to dig down and see if we have what it takes to come back and we did (Friday). We have what it takes for our starters to shut somebody down. We saw the ability for one of our starters get on the ropes and then pull it back together and give us a chance. We saw the power. We saw some speed. We saw defense. You need to see those glimpses to have that faith as you move forward. Instead of saying, ‘Well, I think we can do this,'… but to actually have it reinforced by having it pulled together early are things that you can tap into later."
Defensive end Frostee Rucker left Cincinnati for Cleveland and a five-year, $21 million contract. Rucker had his best season in 2011 with a career-high four sacks in 11 starts.
Bouchard is the obvious choice for the needle job, Davis said, because he is the crewman closest to the wall. The team keeps the insulin and needle in the pit, and if Kimball needs the shot, he is to radio the pit. Davis estimates it would cost the team "a couple seconds" if they ever had to carry out the plan.
If both went to Stanford, it almost certainly would have played out much differently, of course.
1. Good food = less "silent" brain trouble. Brain scans of 966 older New York City residents show that loading your plate with Mediterranean-inspired cuisine (vegetables, fruit, fish, whole grains, nuts, olive oil -- and a little wine) protects tiny blood vessels in the brain. People who ate this way had less blood vessel damage caused by silent strokes, which fuzz up your ability to balance your checkbook, remember your neighbor's name, or play a mean game of pinochle.

Crab cake sliders ($10) were another interesting take on a Jersey favorite. These were topped with a creamy but spicy salad dressing (think Thousand Island) and served on tiny warmed buns. A great idea — a generous serving of three, and well executed — but it would have been better if the crab cake itself were more succulent.
Caleb Wohlford never expected that problem. He'd been a cargo specialist in Iraq and worked for a cardboard company before deploying, so he figured he'd settle into factory work back home in Kokomo, Ind.

Mayer concludes: "Executive action can serve as a spark to ignite a broader dialogue by placing an issue on the national agenda and extending the envelope of acceptable social policies. It can establish an anchor point for political debate, can help draw Congress and the courts along. By itself, though, it cannot create consensus where the middle ground does not otherwise exist."

Jackson held out early in camp in a contract dispute and was disgruntled much of the season. But he still managed to lead the Eagles with 961 receiving yards. He poses a duel threat as a receiver/returner, and made the Pro Bowl in 2010 at both positions. The Eagles could franchise him or try to sign him to a long-term deal. If they let him go, few teams know him better than the Browns: Heckert drafted him in 2008 and coach Pat Shurmur was the Eagles' quarterbacks coach that season. Perhaps he'd have a better attitude and fewer drops with a change of scenery and a new long-term deal at top dollar.

Bogie wouldn't recognize the ample overcoat he sulked around in in "Casablanca," constructed with so much material that extensive creases around the middle were inevitable.

Largest of the European companies is Viking River Cruises, with a passenger list that is 85 percent North Americans. Viking is so busy that it is introducing six 190-passenger boats this year, raising the company fleet to 28. Next year, six more will pop out of a shipbuilding company in Rostock, Germany. And the year after, in 2014, there will be six more if Viking picks up its construction option. There's reason to believe that Viking will do so, because by mid-March of this year, 88 percent of the cabins on the six new Viking boats already were booked for 2012 season, which typically runs from early April into December. (This is not a bad time for travelers to be thinking about a river cruise for 2013, and discounts are available.)

Just a few minutes from bustling downtown streets, it can feel like a hideaway or a secreted speakeasy, right down to the skill with mixed drinks, and a smart offering of beer and wine. But the acoustics need work. When it's good and busy, it can be loud.

A year earlier, that award went to "God of Carnage," a comedy of bad manners by Yasmina Reza ("Art"). When two sophisticated couples get together to deal with their children's playground squabble, it turns out that the parents are a lot like the kids - only worse. Ed Stern will direct the production, which opens at the Cincinnati Playhouse in the Park.
"In the case of 'Bridesmaids,' it was such a well-respected breakthrough kind of film, which I thought was hilarious and allowed women to do what men have done in films," said David Hoberman, producer on "The Muppets." "So I was glad to see it get the nominations it did get. Yet I can see, as far as best picture, it is hard to put it side by side with ... 'Ben-Hur' or 'The Sound of Music' or something."
Kati and her boyfriend Peter met us, and soon we were on the road to a shopping mall. A shopping mall in Zambia? Where was Tarzan and his vine-swinging delivery of fresh coconuts and bananas to Jane in the treehouse?
The new PreCheck program is very small. TSA officials estimate that somewhere from 5,000 to 8,000 travelers could eventually be ushered through the specialized security lines daily. That's less than 1 percent of the average number of passengers screened daily at domestic airports. No one in the program is guaranteed an expedited screening, and the TSA says they're still subject to random and unpredictable security steps.

Cameron, who has been vocally critical of the post-conversion of conventionally filmed movies to 3-D, has obviously taken great pains in using stereoscopic technology to enhance the experience of watching his swooningly romantic and dazzling Best Picture of 1997.
"When I pointed out damage to the car on the initial walk-around, the rep refused to circle any damage on the rental form," says Weaver. "The rep said the only damage that concerned them was golf-ball size dents or larger. So something smaller than a golf ball that breaks the windshield, you're not worried about?"

Tell us a Cleveland Christmas memory.
Like any governor of a big and diverse state, Kasich makes policies that arguably have not all been good for a place like Cleveland. But no one should doubt for a moment that Kasich cares about cities.
How I’ve missed Williams’ irate outbursts, absent the factual evidence to back them up. Still, fanatical accusations (eradication, torture, lies, etc.) do serve at least one valuable purpose. They plainly expose the irrational, hysterical mental state of today’s liberals. A whole lot of emotional whining, but never substance.

"It makes you realize that you are part of a great tradition here in Columbia," Eagles pitcher Brady Luther said. "The new facility is state of the art and is going to be for the next few years, and it is a great privilege to be able to break it in my senior year and play on it first."

A lack of snow this winter also got the spring growing season off more slowly than normal. Snow melt saturates soil gradually, but the 1.8 inches of snow measured at BWI Marshall Airport this winter was the third-smallest seasonal snowfall on record.
Roberts said the teenager, who is on the swim team and in ROTC at Kettering High School, broke into an office in the home to get a gun owned by his mother's fiancé. He said the boy's mother had been refusing to allow him to have girls over at the house or spend time with a group of boys that Roberts suspects are involved with a gang.
Roddey was a political newcomer, a Republican in a Democratic county. The danger is graverin Cuyahoga County, he said, because FitzGerald is a former mayor, a Democrat in a Democratic county scarred by a long-running corruption investigation.

Their charts are not meant to disseminate information, but to create fear. With a growing deficit looming in the background, the administration claimed that faculty will need to increase productivity and capacity -- i.e., increase class sizes -- and that PSU will be implementing retirement incentives so that higher-paid faculty can be replaced with lower-cost alternatives. In academics, "lower cost" means adjuncts who are paid by the course, often teach huge classes and have no benefits. Many adjuncts working at PSU teach at one or two other schools and make only enough to hover around the poverty line. Some are on food stamps. This is the current administration's vision of PSU's future: lower-quality education and a workforce living in poverty.
Of the yearly calls that required a firetruck or ambulance - some 11,000 calls - about 3 percent are from people who don't know their location, said Bob Watts, director of the St. Charles County Department of Dispatch and Alarm.

How did you get to St. Louis?
Eleven years ago, Pennsylvania's Allegheny County embarked on the same journey. --Allegheny County now has a decade of experience in being governed by a county council and a county executive. They replaced a three-commissioner system. I had the privilege of helping to enact the referendum giving Allegheny County a home-rule government and, subsequently, to serve as the first elected county chief executive. I believe that the vast majority of Allegheny County citizens would agree that our change of government has been a success. I also believe it could have been even better, had we been more bold in our plans for restructuring. I could list volumes of things to consider during your transition. However, I will limit my recommendations 'to the following six:
øThese are the things that make you you. Knowing this helps you identify themes and patterns that give you insight into where you thrive. How do others describe you? How do past managers describe you in performance reviews? Do you need a lot of autonomy? Are you patient and caring?

"What I have had a hard time absorbing was how young my mother and father were (29 and 30, respectively) when they left Czechoslovakia," she said.

"We believe that in today's China, what happens to the millions of rights defending petitioners, the Falun Gong practitioners, the religious sufferers, and the political dissidents is still worthy of our in-depth attention. In this huge group of victims there are a lot of people who are still suppressed by the authorities, they are also in urgent need of international attention. Only when the whole society pays attention to the human rights situation in China, particularly long-term concern for the victims at the lowest levels of society, toward the weak ones who have no rights, no influence, no fame, only then can one truly promote the in-depth development of China's human rights movement and improve the rights situation."

Inside the numbers, though, may be the year's most remarkable comeback. Huh played his first nine holes in 44 shots — an 8-over-par chasm that nearly led him to pull a premature plug.
Sunday's other big winner was Alexis Tsipras, the 38-year-old leader of the Radical Left Coalition, or Syriza, who saw his party poised for an unprecedented second place with 16.4 percent and 51 seats — the first time in nearly 40 years that any party other than New Democracy or PASOK has held the spot.

Grand ideas: With roads still in their infancy, it wasn't easy to drive between cities, especially Phoenix and Los Angeles. Annual endurance races between the two cities were held from 1908 through 1914, in part to publicize the need for a decent road.
The real truth is that for Nowitzki nothing much changed, as Deadspin.com's Luke O'Brien pointed out in a perceptive essay soon after the Finals. Nowitzki still scored much more often on jump shots than drives. He is no threat to make a highlight show by dunking. He became more of a low-post presence, although not in the usual back-to-the-basket way. He didn't seize the moment. He caressed it softly.

While Oregon City started using the programs successfully a few years ago and teachers elsewhere have celebrated their use of the programs, parents in school districts across Oregon are now receiving permission slips that clear the way for their child's participation. Before signing, they should ask their school district leaders how they plan to gauge the effectiveness of using Google Apps -- for their child and for their school. Parents should know, too, whether their district has plans for those who do not immediately flourish in an online environment or those who might wish not to participate.

Altmire, who did not return calls and emails to his office requesting an interview, is not among the biggest recipients of donations from Invacare, which since 2005 has given more than $1 million to federal candidates and political committees that support them. The largest sums have gone to Ohioans, including House Speaker John Boehner ($87,300, including $48,300 this year to the Boehner for Speaker Committee from Barbara Mixon); home-district Democratic Rep. Betty Sutton ($58,650), and Republican Rep. Pat Tiberi, a Columbus-area Republican ($44,900). These sums, from CQ MoneyLine's databases, represent contributions since 2005 and include donations from Invacare executives, Mixon's wife, a homemaker, and the Invacare PAC. The donations went to the politicians' election campaigns as well as the politicians' own leadership PACs.

Up until the mid-1920s, Biggers wrote well-received and popular novels such as "Seven Keys to Baldpate" (1913), adapted several times for the silver screen and given regards to Broadway by George M. Cohan. Then a chance encounter with a newspaper article while on vacation in Hawaii introduced Biggers to the horsewhip-carrying, scar-inflected, Chinese American police detective Chang Apana, whose fluency in several languages and frequent (if unorthodox) crime-solving proved to be just the creative catalyst Biggers needed. And so, Charlie Chan was born, approximately 80 pages into "A House Without a Key" (1925), and proved so popular he returned for five more adventures, starting in 1927 with "The Chinese Parrot."
But in a major upset, newcomer Rashied McCreary stunned the city’s political scene when he scraped out a narrow win for the third contested seat on behalf of the Education Matters team.
Additionally, the issue of national debt has not crept up on us. The house of fiscal policy was built upon the sand long ago. Entitlement spending for the high-powered elderly population — that is, automatic benefits such as Social Security and Medicare — has continued to grow, unquestioned, without monetary adjustments or eligibility requirements. It is a part of the discussion regarding the national debt currently, but its appearance on the radar will be brief. Once a "deal" is made to take a legitimate bite out of the debt, akin to what happens to the those unsuspecting seals during "Shark Week," the rest of the problem (still trillions of dollars) will fade away from the public's consciousness.
And if the brass talks the talk, but top executives aren't painting a homeless shelter with the crew on Saturday or reading to kids as part of the literacy program, the initiative will ring hollow.

Hi Benjamin. Why don't the Nuggets improve their half-court offense? Teams know they have a good chance to win if they slow us down.

My most favorite food in the world is ice cream. I was introduced to Graeter's about 12 years ago, and nothing beats black raspberry chip and mocha chip. I had my brother bring it back for me after every Buckeyes game he would attend, but now I find it at Heinen's.
2. Timing. If this 10-game cool spell had taken place in late June, it wouldn't be that big of a deal. But the 6 for 40 (.150) start is drawing more attention because it's happened at the start of the season. And overreaction is more typical early in the season.

Ladakh is a conservative place when it comes to expressions of romantic love, and so a foreigner should take care not to do anything that might seem flirtatious.
"They're getting rid of a lot of people in the front counter." Campos said. "There's a constant flow of people here. They want information and direction: how to have their water turned on; who is going to pick up their trash; new residents who want to sign up for utilities; they want a copy of their birth certificate; they want something notarized; they pay their water bills here; they want to know where to pay a ticket. Who is going to help these people in the front counter?"

Kinney (who co-stars in the new CBS cop drama "NYC 22," which premieres Sunday) is blunt about the trade-off: "The theater in Chicago is superior by a long way. It's not starting with dollar signs. That's the difference, and it's a very big one and a very clear one."

The Public Employees Retirement System saw the biggest impact to its portfolio of Lehman Brothers holdings. They declined in value from $441.4 million in December 2007 to just $73.3 million in December 2008, three months after Lehman filed for bankruptcy protection. That figure represents the market value of the holdings, not any gains or losses on individual stocks or bonds.
Speaking at "hallowed ground" at the Pentagon, President Barack Obama alluded to the controversy over a mosque — and a Florida pastor’s threat, later rescinded, to burn copies of the Muslim holy book.

And last year, Best Buy sold Napster, its online music service, to Rhapsody for an undisclosed sum. Industry observers at the time estimated Napster had fewer than 400,000 subscribers, far fewer than the 706,000 subscribers in 2008 when Best Buy acquired the music service for $121 million.
Sandy Bauer, who manages the raceway's swap meet, estimated she has 40 to 50 more sellers signed up now than at the same time last year. But she doesn't know whether that's a direct result from the changes at the Expo Center.
It was clear Friday that Romney was feeling somewhat reassured by the latest polls that show his prospects improving in the run-up to Tuesday's GOP primary in Michigan. He didn't mention any of his Republican primary opponents by name, or even try to make a case for why he's the best choice in the GOP field until he was asked point-blank about it in the final question.
Graduate student Jenny Hanson, 29, ended the 30-minute question and answer portion by asking Christie why he uses words like "thuggery," "fight" and "disrupter" in dealing with the union and if he has ever considered that his approach might not be working.

Finally, it's time for "Mixology," a free-form blend of improv, stand-up and other comedy odds and ends. Gavlick takes the mic and does some material for his stand-up act. He tells a joke about his parents putting him in a "baby derby" when he was a year old: "A baby derby is a cockfight for suburban white people." He makes fun of his lack of athleticism: "What I lack in physical strength, I make up for in my knowledge of Arthur Miller plays." And his age: "Where my virgins in the audience at?" he calls, then points to himself -- "Right here."

If anyone wondered if Wednesday's amazing atmosphere might have induced the Maloofs to change their minds -- well, they weren't even at the game. That's sad, as for much as they are now hated, those guys were a major part of the franchise's success and character in the city. But last night, they were already in New York for their meeting today with NBA owners.
"This is a great opportunity for us all to remember a titanic struggle for the future of our nation that still shapes us today," said Bill Jackson of Overland, vice president of the Civil War Round Table of St. Louis, an organization for the seriously history-minded.

In June of 2011, Pryor ended his Buckeye career by leaving his lawyer's office, his attorney Larry James passing along a one-sentence statement Tuesday night that the quarterback with the 31-4 record as a starter was giving up his senior season for the good of his teammates. Pryor was a winner with thrilling skills, yet the best thing he could do in the end was leave while no one was watching.

Percussionists rarely get to take the spotlight in the classical repertoire -- composers only began to focus on the potential of orchestral percussion in the last century and star players capable of winning attention for their music are few. So the Oregon Symphony's presentation Saturday night of Jennifer Higdon's Percussion Concerto, which won the Grammy for best classical contemporary composition a year ago, was a rare treat, especially given that the soloist was the man for whom she wrote it, Colin Currie, making his third OSO appearance, and Higdon herself was also in the audience.

“At first I ran 5Ks and 10Ks but when I turned 50 years old I wanted to see if I could run full marathons,” Quick says. “My first was the Delaware Marathon, a qualifier for Boston. I needed to run a 3:35 to qualify and I finished in 3:34. Really, it wasn’t a goal; I just wanted to see if it could be done.” Quick’s initial Boston Marathon time was the 4:03 he ran in 2008. He was satisfied with that, noting objective No. 1 was just to complete the race. He wasn’t pleased with the 4:11 he ran the following year but was delighted with his Boston-best 3:37 in 2011 even though it merely meant he wound up in 9,500th place.

A more direct explanation has to do with the basic requirements of movie storytelling.
