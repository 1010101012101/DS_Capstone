The following day was where we really went awry. We woke up a bit late and went and ate lunch. We all got Rabo de Toro (bull tail) which is what everyone told us to try there. And truth be told, it was absolutely delicious! After we finished eating, we went to see the El Alcázar, but right as we got there, they were closing! And it was only two in the afternoon! This really pissed me off, but whatever, there are somethings you just have to get over. So we tried to see the same synagogue from the day before and that too was of course closed. So we killed our last few hours wandering and then we rested in this wonderfully sunlit park and just enjoyed the warmth.
Instead I should be saying, “I’m officially not thinking like a 20-something.”

The fun didn't stop at the wedding, we had a night on the town and a lovely BBQ the next day at Katie's Parents house. It was a great to be able to celebrate the Bride and Groom one last time before they head off on their Honeymoon!!

Malik Ceasars is Asbel's instructor and mentor to the party. He doesn't talk much about his past causing Hubert to distrust him. He is knowledgeable and mature, but shows a childish side when he teases Cheria about her feelings for Asbel and teaching Sophie nonsense for fun.

But the White House gardens were kind of a let down. There are lots of trees, but lots of open space. You’d think the Park Service could do something a little more elaborate with the grounds. After all, we’re supposed to impress our foreign visitors.
“Oh Baby Girl, you know you are. You got spunk. Had it since you came out ass-backward showing the world what you thought of it.” She was referring to my breech birth.
The first flat I moved into was a great little spot my mother found for me when I moved to Tokyo in 2008. It was spacious for a studio, had a lot of natural light and the grey carpeting was a perfect fit for all the white furniture I purchased. On top of that, I managed to convince (dupe!) my friend Sean into building a bedside table for me and fixed up a lamp for ambient lighting that gave the flat a great glow.
She sat on the railing. God she was hot. Short, scrappy MILF wasn’t always my type, but she was the only chick on the team. Well, the only chick that was human. I didn’t want to have to figure out what goes where when things got hot and heavy with the odd hot alien. It sounds fun in theory, sure as hell looks fun on Star Trek… But the positions you’d have to get into. Eeesh.
Pre test run, I would never have contemplated buying an iron like this, thinking it was too big and just overkill.

Note also that, given the small numbers of Antifa members, their feeble financial resources, and the amount of time required to organize any major action, the ability of Antifa to disrupt simultaneous or near-simultaneous events across Europe will be close to zero.

Below is a sketch showing what was involved in the wide excision done to remove the skin around the melanoma on my back, followed by two photos of the incision on my back after the procedure. The first picture shows the size of the elliptical patch of skin about 2.25" wide and 4.25" long that was removed.

Considering we had no budget to work with, unfortunately, that meant going with the basic finishes throughout the home. Formica counters? Yep! Berber carpeting? Sure did. Boob lights galore? You bet! Little did we know then, that this would cause future costs in upgrades, which is what we have been doing slowly ever since.
1,000 little sacrifices no one will ever see and no one needs to know about. Credit and glory are not things you need when love is unconditional.
But, big HEALTH has been fighting this health plan since, at least, the days of President Harry S. Truman. President Truman reminded America that its children would be helped by making health care available to them. And while the neocons have expressed an interest in the human fetus, that interest is political. They want to get their hands on America’s Constitution to declare the fetus a person. And while messing with the Constitution they’ll likely make or try to make other neocon type changes.

See the collection of my eight Political-Philosophic Letters on “Iran: Revolution and Counter-Revolution,” written between Nov. 13, 1978, and Sept. 25, 1981, and translated into Farsi by Iranian revolutionaries. See also English translation of the Introduction to the Farsi edition of this pamphlet on the Afro-Asian Revolutionsby Raha, which was printed in News & Letters, August-September 1983. Of the many crises in the Middle East, the most horrifying is the disintegration and destruction of Lebanon, which began even before Israel’s genocidal 1982 invasion. I am referring to the 1975-76 Civil War. See my Political-Philosophic Letters of 1976, especially Letter Number 6, “Lebanon: The Test Not Only of the PLO but the Whole Left.” (News & Letters, Detroit, Mich.)
Good group of folks came in with the QB, evidently.
“Some reporters are aware that I am Abul Qaqa, they know my voice through our long interactions and they also know the role of Abu Darda who heads the enlightenment committee and sometimes facilitates interviews; yet they (media) go by the unsubstantiated view of government that Abul Qaqa is in custody and I am the new spokesman or number two,” he said.
I’d say the most important question to ask is simply, “Do you love the character and need to know what happens next in his/her life?”

The unsurprising announcement that the Board of the World Bank had voted in favor of the American candidate, Jim Yong Kim, presents an opportune moment to reflect upon the soft power structures that shape global public policy in the early 21st Century inside the UN system and beyond. It is necessary to draw a distinction between Mr. Kim’s substantive qualifications and the procedure by which he was selected. Substantively, although lacking in either financial or diplomatic experience, Dr. Kim is in certain respects an interesting choice because of his lifelong dedication to improving the health of the very poor in the global South, as well as his training in medicine and PhD in anthropology. He has had extensive relevant experience on the ground, and in working with NGOs (he co-founded the widely admired Partners in Health) and in institutional settings (for some years he directed the HIV/AIDs program for the World Health Organization) and has been president of Dartmouth University for the past three years, although stirring controversy during his brief period of administrative tenure. It may be still wondered whether Dr. Kim understands sufficiently the economic dimensions of World Bank policy to enjoy the respect of the professional staff, and might have been more appropriately chosen to head an enhanced program of the Bank devoted to health and poverty. Overall, still, the substantive case for the appointment is relatively strong, although the two opposing candidates, both former finance ministers of developing countries, certainly had equally impressive substantive résumés and ethical profiles, and were plausible choices for this position.
In honor of our anniversary and to save the cost of a card, I thought I would write a post about my 12 favorite things about my Sweetie. Not to be outdone, and because he also didn't buy a card, my Sweetie has decided to write his own list of 12 things that I must post unedited. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he isn't too inappropriate, while at the same time assuming he will be.

This can be glimpsed most clearly in a scene from The Conversation, which Murch also edited, in which Gene Hackman, taller than the other actors he appears with, seems to mimic the precise angle of tilt at which Tatlin’s Tower was meant to repose.

Oh and more stuff by that handsome, bald Scottish fella... What's his name?
I printed the sweet image and a single rose on to watercolour paper then coloured them with a mix of watercolour pencils and Prisma pencils. I added some glitter to the wings. I cut both out then added the image to a die cut oval of white card embossed with the Cuttlebug roses folder. I set this on a mat of pink polka dot paper.
Among other billed events and speakers at this academic symposium are ‘Project Pigeon’ (“an art and education project that works with pigeons as a vehicle to bring people together”), the World Egg Throwing Championships and a talk on Gender, Exercise and Art by Anthony Schrag, an artist now living in Scotland whose work, according to the University of Lincoln, “focuses on blowing things up, climbing on things and occasionally kidnapping people”.

So we begin our prayers by focusing on the One to whom we pray. He is Father and King. Turning our hearts to Him helps us to become like Him.

Below, I’m going to be laying out practical steps towards that end. Change. Some will address seemingly mundane realties; others take on the man behind the curtain. Some may be instantly relevant to you, others you might need to stuff in your back pocket for another time. But, if you long to sense something “more” being birthed in your life—stay tuned.
Even with this conviction, once I decided to make veggie burgers for my challenge, I was still hesitant with the fear that I wouldn't be able to find a really good recipe that would help me prove myself. I looked through dozens of pictures, recipes, and blogposts, before I found the one that called my name. It was just meant to be. :) This recipe comes from a favorite blogger of mine, the wonderful Angela, of Oh She Glows. This is one awesome girl, people, check out her blog! I have a great trust in Angela's recipes and this one just sounded WAY too good to pass up!

My last box seems to be bursting at the seams. As I tear the tape away it spills forth. It is full of all I need to finish my decorating. New to replace the old, perfect for just me. God packed this last box, saving it for when He knew I would need it. It spills forth in a rainbow of color- the white of His presence, the purple of His power and the red of Christ’s loving sacrifice. There is a cleansing blue, awakening yellow, refreshing green. Enough to last a lifetime, just as He planned it to.

I saw Busan Tower in the view, so I could walk toward it directly without a map. Busan roads are up and down the hills(similar to roads near my house. I don’t like it at all. It’s tough to ride a bike). It took me about 25mn to reach the top of Busan Tower hill. But what a surprised, when I reached there, I saw no one but a few locals. Was it too early in the morning? I watched my time; it was nearly 11:00am. It was so peace and quite, and the weather was so cold. I walked down to the Yongdusan Park in front of it. There were many grandpas gathering and playing chess together. I thought they were more interesting than the stone tower behind me. I would have joined with them if I had known how to play. I found a seat nearby and read my guide book what to do next. A little bit later. few visitors started coming, but it was a time for me to leave because my stomach was singing. I went down toward a market. My guide book said there was a street food nearby, so I decided to go there. I love street food so much because it is delicious and cheap. We can choose this one, that one and then eat while walking. I was excited every time I thought about it, but finally, when I arrived here I couldn’t do it as I had planned. I didn’t know how to buy it. Oh no, I knew it was so easy, just sat down and pointed what we want to eat….and when ready, put it into the mouth. But I wasn’t brave to sit down. I didn’t dare to sit down at that street food. My lunch was ended up with a tasteless crispy rice.

Firstly, I take the time to go and borrow a huge water toy from my friend Tina. We've been borrowing a lot of toys with our stuff gone. And this is a cool waterway that boats can float down. All I need to do is carry it to my house (it's light) and fill it with water from the hose out on the back porch.
And no one really knows how or why this number of 20 years came about. I can only assume it was to serve as a guesstimate as to how long it would take to receive the required incentives. Certainly there are certain sectors of technology where the market lead time that a decent innovation would make is sufficient to receive the required incentives - such as software, which in any case is usually obsolete after just 10 years, forget 20.
One of the biggest reasons arts organizations are failing is due to the feelings of entitlement. We have gone through centuries of feeling that the arts are supposed to be supported, and in many cases have rested on this laurel. We have forgotten how to do the good old fashioned work that results in successful arts businesses.
Hence we again strongly recommend to HOLD the stock with a target price of Rs.2965.
For those who don't know, flash fiction is very short fiction (mostly fewer than 500 words), written with no planning, in a single sitting, usually with a time limit, and from a prompt of some kind. The idea is to start from the prompt and simply see where the story takes you. It is a great way of getting started in the morning and often takes you to places you didn't expect. Writers gather words, phrases and images to use as prompts, and it occurred to me, as I lurked in the town centre, that 'bugging' is a great way of generating them.
If you get known for your artistic output, sooner or later, somebody is going to show you something artistic they made and ask you for your honest evaluation and opinion. This is your big chance to add to the stock of beauty in the world, but so many artists completely blow their chance. All too often, they leave the person asking their opinion feeling deflated, humiliated, hurt and small. It doesn’t have to be that way.
The mats around the pool are scratchy and sting bare feet. Beach balls bounce, people listen to transistor radios, kids across the street shriek as they ride the Steeplechase roller coaster. Some of the older kids begin to tease Tommy. They taunt the skinny boy who can’t swim. “C’mon you baby, let’s see you jump off the diving board.”
“When I’m homeless I’m always surrounded by friends. There’s freedom without having to pay rent all the time to a system that’s broken, without having to work a nine to five job and being able to do what you’re actually passionate about. I’d rather live playing music, doing artwork and tattooing people.”

There are Laurence Berns, my College schoolmate, who urged my appointment on Jack Penland, then the Director of the Program. Maurice F. X. Donohue, Dean of the University’s adult education enterprise, was willing to take a chance on someone who had served, as he had, as an officer in the Air Corps during the Second World War. To these should be added the name of Sister Candida Lund, President of Rosary College.

There's great house porn and bar porn and small-cute-town-in-England-porn which is nice. There's a moderately effective villain and some great chain-jerking which allows Gatiss the luxury of tying in another Holmes canon story.
Several years ago, when The OC was first on our screens, after a couple of episodes which seemed to feature the bagel cutter in operation, we did the same. My sons both requested a bagel cutter (at that time they were not available from Amazon) and we decided to ask my husband to buy one on a trip to the States.

And here’s the kicker.
I was travelling abroad by myself for the first time ever, going to a summer school in Berlin. I was hanging out with a group of lovely people I’d met there. We were walking around a flee market, and were supposed to meet again at the end of one isle. That was back in the day when cell phones were scarce, so I waited and waited, and, twenty minutes later, I left. Fail number 1. Oh well, I said to myself, I’m just going to go see the Film Museum. I’d seen posters for it everywhere around Potsdamer Platz. I took the 200 bus and found myself there, only to find out that the museum was only going to open in a few months from then. Fail number 2. That’s ok, I can go see one of the old art museums, like the Pergamon! In my backpack, I was carrying a bottle of beer from the night before, when we’d been to a house party. I wanted to give it to one of my new friends. As I was buying a ticket, trying to navigate the language barrier, I unzipped my backpack to look for coins… when the beer bottle slid out of my backpack and fell on the marble floor. Fail number 3. The portly museum attendants yelled at me in German as they handed me a broom and dustpan. I did my best to maintain my composure, but I started sniffling in the Egyptian section, struggling to see with blurry eyes. Luckily, I met someone else from the school there, and she told me where we were supposed to meet that evening. Exhausted after the day’s adventures, I headed home. Home was the tiny studio of a German student with bright red hair and excellent taste in books. She was sleeping on the bed, while I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor. I knocked on the door. No answer. I knocked again. No answer, again. I started fumbling for the key in the backpack, when I heard a bump, followed by Ella at the door, flushed and wearing only her top and undies. And then I see her boyfriend. And then I see what used to be her Ikea bed. In the heat of the moment, perhaps rushing to finish what they started, or rushing to open the door, they had broken the bed. Because of me. Fail number 4. And this, dear readers, is the story of the most embarrassing day of my life.
Treatment of a simple, viral laryngitis relieves the symptoms. Gargling with warm salt water, using pain relievers such as acetaminophen, using a vaporizer to create moist air, and resting will help the illness resolve within a week. Over-the-counter remedies such as throat sprays and lozenges may provide relief.
That is not to say that I don’t know people who died because of the storm, because I do. I know people who couldn’t handle the aftermath of that time. I know people who, even though they are technically alive, are almost dead inside – still, because of what happened. But on the other hand, I know sooo many people who triumphed after Katrina – who looked at their destroyed homes, cried for a moment and then got to work. I know people who are still struggling to make it back, but they’re making progress so that’s what counts. I know people who went through so much during that time, but they’re standing and I look at them as some of the strongest people that I know.

"I'm like your Daddy. I just can't look up to a woman priest. And I never know what to call 'her. I can't call her 'Father' and I can't call her 'Mother.' So she ends up being just 'you,' or 'Karen' or 'Linda' or somebody. And the vestments never fit women right in front, do they?"The story ends with some surprises which, on reflection, make sense to me. This book has a sequel showing Margaret still struggling with her past; I'll write about that one tomorrow.
I was rubbing her shoulders. The aroma of the toasted bagels we had just eaten still lingered, and we were waiting for tea to cool. It was evening, and her family was gone; they’d be back tomorrow, but they left the house to us. She moaned each time I hit a tender spot; I tend to forget to be gentle during a massage, because I always have knots that are deep in the gnarled tissues in my back and like a lot of pressure.
We had a relatively early night as we were back in the room for 2.00AM (many of the bars / clubs there are open until 5 or 6 in the morning!) as Chrissie was not feeling to good with a bad throat. It was nice to finally meet them both. They were fun and I had a good night.
It's none too soon for me to get the hell out of this temporary flat. While it's not a bad place, it's nowhere near as nice as our own place. This was brought fiercely home to me tonight, when, as I was loading the dishwasher, it tumped forwarded and everything rolled out. I mean it just face planted right out of the cabinet onto the floor. A whole damned dishwasher. Talk about a "What the fuck?" moment. Have you ever heard of such a thing? I was rather stunned. I just sort of shoved it back into the cabinet and rolled the trays and such back in, and it seems to be working ok. Maybe someone ought to look at it.

Sponsors of the event ranged from various education reform groups funded by hedge-fund managers, like the nonprofit Education Reform Now, to ABS Capital, a private equity firm with a stake in education-technology companies like Teachscape. At smaller breakout sessions, education enterprises made their pitches to potential investors.
It could hold about 55,000 people, seated according to social status, and it is amazing to think that all our modern stadiums are really based on the principles of design established way back then.

His dangerous and desperate flip-flopping has him so coated in Santorum that he’s adopting the most far-right talking points as his campaign positions, no matter how illogical or unpopular. The terrifying example that wins him this week’s award is a single sentence from a campaign stop, bizarrely included in a discussion of budget cuts: “Planned Parenthood, we’re going to get rid of that.” REALLY? Let’s set aside for a moment that this is an independent organization, not a Federal program, so any attempt to “get rid” of it is anti-business (ironic much?). Far more terrifying is that the putative front-runner for President in one of our two major parties has officially endorsed the war on women. The Romneyborg wants us ignore the fact that the vast majority of the services Planned Parenthood provides are critical women’s health care to poor and rural women. He has become so extreme in his eagerness to clinch the nomination that he’s endorsing the radical anti-contraception position that the vast majority of Americans (including Catholics and all Republicans other than the Tea Party) oppose. This candidate’s dizzying spin might provide a great alternative energy source; in every other respect it just induces nausea–yes, I will have to spit up after publishing this.

(If ‘A’) Take constructive criticism on the chin. You are a long way off honing your writing craft and achieving publication. Every writer can always improve with time, effort and proper guidance. Join a local writing workshop run by an established writer and teacher. Join a book club and widen your own reading taste. Then, start an entirely new writing project and begin submitting your work again to agents and publishers.

What?!? He had done nothing, absolutely nothing, to deserve this. What law had this lawbreaker kept? What alms had he given; only taken? How many prayers and fasts had he obeyed? How much Torah had he memorized? And yet forgiveness? And here we learn they are right: Grace is God’s prerogative. Because let’s be honest with each other. If it were up to you and me, no one other than ourselves would be forgiven. We talk a lot about how much God’s grace has done in our lives, but we are not quite so willing to extend that grace to others.

If religious belief emerges through a converging set of intuitive processes, and analytic processing can inhibit or override intuitive processing, then analytic thinking may undermine intuitive support for religious belief. Thus, a dual-process account predicts that analytic thinking may be one source of religious disbelief. Recent evidence is consistent with this hypothesis finding that individual differences in reliance on intuitive thinking predict greater belief in God, even after controlling for relevant socio-demographic variables. However, evidence for causality remains rare. Here we report five studies that present empirical tests of this hypothesis.

The Notleys, Rayne, Flitch Way, John Raye....Miles and miles of public walkways stretching, turning and curving all over the area, mostly rural farmland but interspersed all along by the ubiquitous hedge ways of old England and also of course, some pristine old woodlands such as Bushy Wood and Garnet Forest. I have barely begun to scratch the surface.
The hypnosis wasn’t much for me this week. I laid there, stood on the tenth floor of the building of relaxation. It was empty as always. I took the elevator in the center of the floor. Rode it down to the bottom. I noticed this time I was in a nice black suit. For whatever reason. I started to walk down the hallway, opened the door… and she talked to me. In the beginning, she had me place outdated ideas, fears and concepts into this whirlpool. And after a moment of looking at these useless items in the whirlpool, I was to pull a plug out, and watch these unneeded items leave me. I stood and watched. Sometimes the water was in a tub, then it might shift to a large, round room. Then it would go to being an ocean… and back and forth between these various ideas. After that, I don’t remember a lot of imagery. There were shades of red, black, and skin tone. But honestly, not a lot of images. The hypnosis itself consisted of more or less opening the 5 senses to your partner. Which I suppose would help me to actually do more with him, and find more ways to connect with him.
I hear so many girls going on and on … and on about the ex … and I just don’t get it. I mean if he’s going on about her then cut that boy loose and if he isn’t going on about her, then why are you?

Stuff Smith is one of those musicians that were around for a long time but never really got very famous. I personally "heard" of him when I was studying that historic photo. So I was interested in his music and found this little compilation of his works that he did for various bands. Stuff on here by, err, Stuff is during 1917 to 1949 so there's a lot of big band swinging here that's practically on fire. It's a shame that we don't get to hear more of his bebop recordings because later on Stuff really did kill dem strings. On some songs he's not that obvious while on some he get's even a solo or two. It's just so weird for me to hear a violin in a swing band among all those brass and wood instruments. Certainly worth checking out if you like big band music.
For this project, I used my Cricket, River, and warped up four colors of some Tahki Cotton Classic yarn I’d bought from Cotton Clouds. I like jewel tones and bright colors. These may clash a bit from your point of view, and even from mine, but this combination of colors, for some reason, reminds me of childhood summers in the…you know what? I think I won’t date myself too much here!

Come with me back to 8 days ago, on the last day of school. I had one kid home with an ear infection, and the other with asthma symptoms plus a slight fever. Much to their utter dismay, they missed that last day of school. Try as they might to con me all the rest of the year into staying home when they "didn't feel good," there was much sadness to miss that last day. I can't blame them. No one wants to miss the fun stuff. We were also disappointed to be missing a pool party later that day. Mother Nature helped us out with that one as it rained all afternoon and evening, postponing the party to the following day.

Here’s the statement in question:
Selden and Lily stood still, accepting the unreality of the scene as a part of their own dream-like sensations. It would not have surprised them to feel a summer breeze on their faces, or to see the lights among the boughs reduplicated in the arch of a starry sky. The strange solitude about them was no stranger than the sweetness of being alone in it together. At length Lily withdrew her hand, and moved away a step, so that her white-robed slimness was outlined against the dusk of the branches. Selden followed her, and still without speaking they seated themselves on a bench beside the fountain.

The big meet of the weekend was the European Indoor Champs, and the star of the Paris show was home boy Teddy Tamgho (FRA) who improved his own WR by twice leaping 58’ 9.5” to demolish the competition. This was the second time this year that Tamgho raised the WR having done so in Aubiere (58’ 9.25”) last month. His gold medal victory was the highlight of an indoor season that saw him leap over 58’ 9.25” THREE times. More importantly he showed tremendous consistency AND the ability to compete well and jump long under pressure – something that seemed to be missing among his long leaps of last year. Based on current form he could well jump over 59 feet outdoors AND win gold in Daegu – and dare I say we could see him approach the magical 60 foot barrier.

Also in 1969 John Peel signed Vincent to his newly formed Dandelion label - incongruously he became a labelmate of Bridget St John and Medicine Head: sessions produced by Kim Fowley were disappointing, though a duet of Scarlet Ribbons with Linda Ronstadt stands out for its weirdness. He performed at the John and Yoko-sponsored Toronto Rock'n'Roll Festival, backed the Alice Cooper band, in September '69. Heavy drinking made for a shambolic show. At the end of the year he was back in Britain, touring dance halls which were appreciative but mostly small time. His backing group by now was a Croydon rock revivalist act called the Wild Angels and the BBC caught the first few days - including fumbling rehearsals in a pub basement, walls lined with used mattresses, Gene very patient with his amateurish young charges - on a beautiful but melancholy documentary.

For these six special shows, Björk will be performing new songs from the forthcoming Biophilia studio album as well as music from her genre-defying back catalogue with a group of unique musical collaborators and a choir of 24 girls, Graduale Nobili. The show will feature a range of specially conceived and crafted instruments, among them a bespoke digitally-controlled pipe organ; a 30 foot pendulum that harnesses the earth's gravitational pull to create musical patterns - creating a unique bridge between the ancient and the modern and a bespoke gamelan-celeste hybrid. These devices reveal some of the physical processes that are the subject matter of the songs.
Even the information on Wikipedia is in error. Wikipedia gives you the history of CIA agent Harvey Barnard’s NESARA law. If you look closely, this law stands for National Economic Stabilization and Recovery Act, which would have made reforms to the economy and replace the income tax with a national sales tax. This law was rejected by congress in the 1990’s. But there is little mention of the National Economic Security and Reformation Act on Wikipedia or its ramifications.

Davis: Well, I’d say it the other way around, actually. If you look at a city like Los Angeles, and its extreme dependence on regional infrastructure, the question of whether certain cities become monstrously over-sized has less to do with the number of people living there, than with how they consume, whether they reuse and recycle resources, whether they share public space. So I wouldn’t say that a city like Khartoum is an impossible city; that has much more to do with the nature of private consumption.

These two books were unlike any I have done. The tale is a bit strange as the main character sits down to relate his life story to a chronicler. I was hooked in the first 45 minute trip home. I was so nuts about this book I would get to work and sit in my car for 10 more minutes. 10 minutes is how long the power stays on in my car when you turn the key off. I really can not get into the story as I am not that good of a writer my self. But I can say this guy tweaked fantasy just enough to make it fresh, and like new. Well worth the read, or listen.

In January 2009, I ran the 5k. As I crossed the finish line, I made two phone calls. The first was to my husband to say I had done it. The second was to my trainer to thank him. He had believed in me and he showed me how to believe in myself. The next day, as I watched thousands of people complete the half-marathon, I told the race directors, I’d be back next year — and I would run the half.
What the agent should bring to the relationship is a detailed knowledge of the market for the type of book you are writing or want to write. So if you want to write young adult fantasy, an agent who specialises in romance novels or non-fiction is not going to be much help. Your agent should know which editors are in the market for your type of book, which lists they are running at the moment, and what they are likely to be buying. Your agent should know if an editor has just signed a very public deal for a book too like yours for it to be worth approaching them with yours - and should know who will want a title to compete with that blockbuster. Having the wrong agent is worse than having no agent as they will send your book to inappropriate editors and give you a bad name while not actually getting you any money. Worse, they'll sell your book short, getting a poorer deal than another agent could have secured.

Now is the team good enough? In goal they have Joe Murphy who is very experienced and has got two international caps to his name so he must have some ability. At Scunthorpe United he was very good and helped them to promotions which will obviously help the younger players in the team next year. In defence they do have some talented players, Richard Wood is one that has suffered with injuries throughout the season and he has been a big miss because he was very highly rated at Sheffield Wednesday and looked like he was going to play at the highest level. Jordan Clarke is only 20 but has nearly played 50 games for Coventry already and will now be needed more than ever and he will have to deal with this kind of pressure next year. Nathan Cameron is very similar but the one they have to hold onto is most certainly is Cyrus Christie who has played nearly every game this season and has not looked too fazed, although he has made mistakes which are expected he has dealt with most things pretty well.

Later in his account of his mission Rowan wrote, “The President was anxious for information. He realized that success meant that the soldiers of the republic must co-operate with the insurgent forces of Cuba. He understood that it was essential to know how many Spanish troops there were on the island, their quality and condition, their morale, the character of their officers, especially those of the high command; the state of the roads in all seasons; the sanitary situation in both the Spanish and insurgent armies and the country in general; how well both sides were armed and what the Cuban forces would need in order to harass the enemy while American battalions were being mobilized; the topography of the country and many other important facts.”
Talukadiah arrived home at 4:55, after a long day of planting magic beans on his 449 square foot plot of property in Northern Gnome, Alaska. He read that there had been 13 inches of snow fall that night, following twice as much the week before! His 3 brothers and 5 sisters each had planted 45 magic beans, with one of those sisters, Groznzk, then planting 12 more. After a nice 3 course meal, Talukadiah and his family, minus one brother, compared their earnings. In all, they had made $450. The older brother got to keep 1/9 of this, while the older sister got to keep 1/10 of the remaining money. Talukadiah normally put away all but $5 of his earnings in a bag under his mattress, but only weeks ending in an even-numbered day. He looked at the calendar and saw that it was Wednesday, December 4, that it was 14 degrees F outside, and that 25 minutes had passed since his arrival home. If Talukadiah is 8 inches taller than his younger brother, how much money is in the bag underneath his mattress? Also, Symmetry.

In that dead spot of the evening when northern Europeans are already winding down but Spaniards are barely getting ready for dinner, I was sitting in a bar, almost deserted but for me and the staff (Chinese, as it happened), and a TV displaying impressive diving skills - for a lower league football match. About half a dozen Scandinavian ladies of a certain age arrived, and started ordering (in English): but "Irish coffee" produced a blank response, as did "ice cream". I tried suggesting "café irlandes", but that was no help. "Café con whiskey" got a bit further, but the idea of putting the two together in one cup was clearly more than strange.

The pattern called for Rowan DK soft, which I think has now been discontinued. I had found some soft wool in Hobbycraft of all places - Eco wool by Sirdar - which is an undyed 100% wool. Not sure what the breed is (they helpfully just describe it as 'earth'), but it might be something like Castlemilk. Its thicker than the DK soft, and, as I later out, only has around half the yardage - so I kept having to go back and buy a couple more balls, and then a couple more! The pattern called for 5 50g balls, I used nearly 11 - so let that be a warning!!

After some pondering, I decided to get the 1/2" x 1' rod for $2.70 ... that's 1/10th of the cost of the PME pin.

Populating their wooded cabin with veritable unknowns led by Kristen Connolly as the wouldbe final girl (the relatively untested soap opera actress more than holds her own in the role), the aforementioned Mr. Kranz (indeed a performance that could be used in any legalize pot ad) and bohunk Aussie Chris Hemsworth (during the nearly two year post-production hiatus this film suffered due to MGM's financial woes, then unknown Hemsworth has become the Mighty Thor and is these days basking in the glow of it-boy status) and popping in a few relative names (Bradley Whitford, Richard Jenkins, Sigourney Weaver), Whedon and Goddard have created a sturm und drang of cinema that does for the horror genre what Todd Haynes' equally audacious, cut and paste I'm Not There did for the biopic. I do not think I am being presumptuous in calling this the best American film of the year so far, and a sure bet for my eventual Best of the Year list. I do not think I would be wrong in calling this puzzle-cum-mindfuck of a motion picture, the most batshitcrazy of the year as well - even if many horror fans will not get or like it. In the end, when the gauntlet is almost literally thrown down, all we can do is wonder what could possibly follow this inevitable moment zero in the horror genre. I know that I for one am both frightened and titillated by the possibilities.
To my surprise, I was throwing those ingredients out on a whim, and amazingly, they all went superbly well together. So impressed with my pizza putting-together skillz. And what a yummy mad skillz to have.
Setting itself up as an instruction manual on how to get your soul through those pearly gates, the film really stretches the door metaphor thin.
Chances are good you are a law abiding person except for maybe a little light weed smoking and maybe driving a little drunk every once in a while. Most of your life you have been taught to be nice and don't point guns at people. You are the exact opposite of your enemy who was taught just the opposite. Remember a lot of street life is like prison life. Who's the man is everything. Violence is the currency of the street.

In a demonstration of pure obstinancy, Patchen built a fence around his reacquired land, “played the tyrant, refused a right of way to all who needed it,” and landed himself right back into a host of lawsuits.
Before that though, here's today's QoTD teaser -
So Run DMC publicly announce their support for Joey Brown, the notorious black high school principal for New Jersey, whose "talk tough" policy towards pupils has caused much controversy in the States, because of its emphasis on discipline, rectitude, not to mention Brown's bent for patrolling the playground with a loudhailer in one hand and a baseball bat in the other.
The world economy is undergoing a major transformation. Increased understanding of the inter linkages between social policies (for example, in housing, education and health care) and fiscal-financial policies is more important than ever. Fresh thinking is taking place in a number of development policy areas, and “global commons” issues require solutions.
So anyway, with all the outcomes making me dizzy, I figured I’d simplify and, as I’m feeling quietly optimistic about all that, I thought I’d take what should be a final opportunity to have a good whinge. Here is something that makes me uneasy about football today:

Sheriff was an accomplished playwright, celebrated for his 1928 play Journey’s End which detailed life in the trenches during WWI. Journey’s End built on his own experiences – he was wounded at Passchendaele. I’d never heard of him before reading this book, although I had vaguely heard of Journey’s End. Reading his wiki biography, I found he was also a prolific writer of screenplays including Goodbye Mr Chips (1933) and The Dambusters. Alongside his theatre and film careers, he found time to write some novels too; The Hopkins Manuscript was his third, published in 1939 and I loved it.

Even in lean times, there has normally been a strong captain. In good times even more so with McLintock, Adams back through to time to Tom Parker. It went awry when perhaps more than ever Arsenal needed it. For the all of his legendary feats, I do not perceive Henry to have been a good captain. Some of that was not his fault with younger players admitting to being intimidated by his reputation. That is not necessarily a problem if one or two make that suggestion but when the number is bigger than that, it is an issue when the captain casts a bigger shadow over the club.

“My mom would cook us Egg over Noodles for weekend breakfast, and we loved it. My grandchildren now love it, only I use whole-grain pasta for them. Put olive oil in the pan, add cold cooked noodles from the night before, scramble the eggs and pour over the warmed (or a little browned) noodles. I add cheese sticks that I have shredded up, or to make it richer, add Pecorino/Romano cheese.’
I'm running a bit late this week, in fact, I've not been stamping. With Easter, a funeral, and a couple other things, I've not gotten to my work table. But I did finally get a couple cards done for my AZ Stampers Above/Below swap and need to get these in the mail. Our theme was "Inchies".
As I'm sure everyone -- EVERYONE already knows, a couple of weeks ago, Adnoxious secured internet immortality on the blog of The Screaming Me Me by securing first place in her Caption This! picture-captioning contest. It got us thinking over here at the palatial Adnoxious campus of Brooklyn, New York, what can we do to plagiarize such a great traffic-driving idea but change it just enough so we can't be sued?
First, a fatal flaw in Smolin’s scenario is his assumption that universes fine-tuned for black-hole production would also be fine-tuned for the production of stable stars. In fact, the exact opposite is true: the most proficient producers of black holes would be universes that generate primordial black holes prior to star formation, so that life-permitting universes would actually be weeded out by Smolin’s cosmic evolutionary scenario. Thus, it turns out that Smolin’s scenario would actually make the existence of a life-permitting universe even more improbable.
As with any baking, keep an eye on your roll. This is just an estimated time. You'll know it's done when the roll is golden and makes a hard tapping sound when you tap it with your fingernail...just like when baking a loaf of bread.
I really enjoyed the story and I have to say I wasn't expecting it to be so sad. My heart was breaking for Jenna and her family. I couldn't stop reading because Ashley did a fantastic job with her debut novel. I really enjoyed the book.
Long ago, in my misspent youth, I shopped at any old grocery store. I didn't care if it was national, local, or international - I was all about the convenience. If it was close, I shopped there. I am mortified to admit that sometimes I didn't even care how clean it was. The horror! I often wandered thoughtlessly through the local Kroger, Big Star, or Food Lion without giving a though to you, humbly waiting in the next town or a few blocks away for a token visit.
How about these, my top secret, middle of the night knits - gloves for the man!

Mother fuck did I ever. And it continued to rage on...and on...and on.....and on!! I thought I was getting better.
The story of the mountain South isn’t the just the story of the poor, the ignorant, and the isolated. A place as rich and complicated as the Appalachians can’t be captured with stereotypes. There’s much more fertile ground to explore, both for writers and readers, in a mountain South that’s appreciated for the diversity and complexity that it contains, both in the 19th century and in the 21st.
I suspect that the sort of people who keep dangerous dogs are the least like to have them microchipped. I suspect this law will be a burden on the law abiding and leave the people who cause the problem untouched.

The majority of the my client's renovation budget was spent on the kitchen, flooring and construction costs, so I knew the bathrooms would be a bit of a challenge. Not so much because of the budget, but because they were all very small. This townhouse had 2 full baths and 2 powder rooms. The 2 full baths were renovated 3 years ago. The full bath on the third floor, which was the largest, remained in good shape. It just needed a good cleaning, new cabinet hardware, mirror, medicine cabinet and lighting.
Looking for Trouble was decent. Typical rich girl gets fed up with her life and tries to make it on her own. Avery does a decent job of it except for the secrets she keeps from Noah, the guy she falls for. Noah has his own family issues to come to terms with. There is a lot of secondary activity with siblings on both sides that acts as filler more than anything. This wasn’t nearly as hostile as Billionaire and I’d consider reading further into the series. There is currently at least one more installment at this time.

I guess I wasn’t prepared for her to be so accepting of this change. Every little bit of independence she loses, she fights. So, I was surprised at this. And I felt pain. I wondered at why I found myself crying, as I headed to the store. I realized that this was exactly how emotional I was when I weened my children. After breast-feeding, I knew it was time to switch them to supplement bottles. And when they so quickly responded to a bottle, I was totally unprepared at their willingness to replace me with plastic.I had secretly hoped that they wouldn’t want that ‘false sense of security.’ I was so attached, that this seemed too easy for them to just, ‘let go.’ I realized that the failure of my mother to fight me, represented the same. It wasn’t her letting go that was so hard, but me.
“I was given the gift of a handicap to keep me in constant touch with my limitations. Satan’s angel did his best to get me down; what he in fact did was push me to my knees. No danger then of walking around high and mighty! At first I didn’t think of it as a gift, and begged God to remove it. Three times I did that, and then he told me: ‘My grace is enough; it’s all you need. My strength comes into its own in your weakness’. Once I heard that, I was glad to let it happen. I quit focusing on the handicap and began appreciating the gift. It was a case of Christ’s strength moving in on my weakness. Now I take limitations in stride, and with good cheer, these limitations that cut me down to size—abuse, accidents, opposition, bad breaks. I just let Christ take over! And so the weaker I get, the stronger I become.” – 2 Corinthians 12:7-10

Before I was certain that I would go to Lewis and Clark university, and then BBC, for my one year certificate. Going to BBC, I love it there. I literally love everything about BBC, the school is small, the people are great, the atmosphere is just so amazing! I also like Boise. So now I want to go to BBC first, I need to figure out if they have a psychology degree for working in a high school, not ministry. I want to work at a high school, ministry is not my thing. I need to figure this out. BBC also gives a lot of scholarships, which is good, so does L&C, I just don’t know. I want so bad to be in a Christian college, but if they don’t offer what I want, I don’t know what I want to do.
I went a little crazy with my Amazon shopping. I bought a pressure canner -- a 23 quart! WooHoo! It should come on the "big brown truck of joy" tomorrow.

Nonprofit professionals learned tips and tricks for using social media to expand their missions April 9 at the Social Media for Nonprofits workshops presented by One Good Deed Chicago, Eventbrite Chicago, Chicago Cares and Simply Social Chicago.
My favorite project in this course was the sculpture park catalogue project. That one was really rewarding because I felt my finished piece was really polished and turned out well, despite printer quality issues. It was extremely time consume going through that amount of photos but I really learned the importance of organizing photos and editing them. It was great working with provided photography to have great photos from different angles to choose how to display them and why. Once I really realized how I wanted to lay things out, I couldn’t believe how that pushed me to look for specific photography and then to be able to go out and take more photos myself was really beneficial to fill in the gaps. Usually I’m not a big fan of large physical construction projects but the physical piece turned out SO well and really did the design justice. It was so simple but showed off the written parts and the sculptures.
SAS 4 Squadron is based in Victoria, at Swan Island in Port Phillip Bay, a high-security facility that has doubled in size in the past decade, in part to accommodate the new squadron. The squadron was formally raised in 2005 by the Howard government, but it has been learnt that its intelligence-focused role was authorized in late 2010 or early 2011. The SAS is at the forefront of gender change in the Australian military, with six female soldiers being trained in the US for their work with 4 Squadron. Collecting intelligence overseas without using violence is the main function of ASIS, which was created in 1952 but not officially acknowledged until 1977. Since the mid-1980s, ASIS has been refused permission to carry weapons or use violence, but in 2004 the Howard government amended legislation to allow officers weapons for self-defence and to participate in violent operations, provided they did not use force. It was about that time, the creation of the fourth SAS squadron was authorised, as they became elite bodyguards and scouts for ASIS intelligence officers. ASIS officers are legally permitted to carry false Australian passports and, if arrested, can deny by whom they are employed. Defence Force members on normal operations cannot carry false identification or deny which government they work for.
Since 2007, when the crisis first hit, prices have fallen sharply with the “Mediterranean Coast” recording an overall decline of 33.1%, over a third of its value. “Capitals and Major Cities” follow with an overall decline of 27.8%, followed by “Metropolitan Areas” with 26.3%, the “Balearic and Canary Islands” with 20.1% and “Other Municipalities”, which includes regions not included in the other categories, with 19.9%.
If you aren’t a Boston sports fan you deserve to burn in hell (just kidding…but really) and you probably have no idea who this is. This beautiful man standing next to my father – my dad being the ginger on the left…not that obvious – is none other that Milan Lucic. He plays for the Boston Bruins and is literally a god. This picture is gold. Ken completely owning the entire thing because his hair is phenomenal – mind your he is 57 and still has the ging-fro – and Lucic is just straight reppin the sox even after the bruins devastating loss just last week. That’s what Boston is about. Unity, and gingers…minus the gingers.
(Food for thought: as far as heart-throbbing love interests go, Harry is too available to the reader. The reader knows his ENTIRE backstory: his abusive childhood, his leap into puberty, his first kiss, etc., because they were right there with him.

I can see where they get the liquorice description on their website. Very vinous feel to it as well, and a a taste that I'd say is closer to raisins or prunes than liquorice. Maybe black jelly beans, a nice middle ground. Low bitterness for the actual 65 IBU's that the brewer claims, so that's a good thing if you ask me.

Next we had our 8 week appt, they took blood, did a urine test, and a pelvic exam. Our insurance is a crazy high deductible and then the ins. co. pays 100% Also, they only cover one ultrasound at 18 weeks to check developement and the sex. A lot of my friends, okay almost ALL of my friends are pregnant or have young babies, I so dearly wanted that first ultrasound to see a little tiny creature, but our insurance didn't cover it and the OB said ... you're perfectly healthy and you only need one ultrasound during your whole pregnancy... unless there are complications. Charles and I left the Dr. office, happy as could be, we were doing great and couldn't wait for the 12 week appt.

In mobile interviews, the ideal situation is to have a dedicated sound operator (“soundie”). The soundie will plug the mics into a portable sound mixer like the one pictured and monitor the audio via a headset. The output of the mixer will either be fed to a portable recording device or (more commonly) fed to the camera and recorded on the same tape as the vision.

I’ve been thinking about this for a while, and discussing it with friends planning on interning for free as well. We seem to accept that its something we will have to do in order to get a job, but I don’t know whether we’re simply accepting it as a necessary part of this industry; whether we actually wouldn’t like to do it, but we know we have to. Or do we actually think it’s right to not get paid for doing genuine work? I think there are many internships which offer genuine experience, and a chance to shadow and observe someone doing the job that you want. But I see ten times as many with a list longer than your screen, of necessary duties and tasks that as an unpaid workie, you are expected to do. Work Experience? Many are more like a senior role! And yet they still turn away tons of applicants. In fact, many fashion students are so desperate for work experience that to get something, anything, no matter what the salary/expenses are, feels like an achievement! It does seem a bit ridiculous when you’re begging a big company to allow you to work for free, and you still get turned down.
At the same time there was a lot of talk about the “Filthy Fifteen” (Parents Music Resource Center committee est. 1985) inspired by the songs Darling Nikki and Sugar Walls that I wrote. Also, inspired by my age, 15, when Joe Elliott of Def Leppard discovered me in the audience of their May 15, 1983 concert. I came up with the tagline “15 minutes could save you 15%“.

And the Bible referenced are from the New Living Translation, an easier version for your child to read and understand.

Then we want to hear from you....We've got a few very short questions about where you buy your stamps!
It's been 23 years since my initial south rim exposure. I'm wondering: will I like it better this time? It's a relative thing because, after all, the GC is my favorite natural wonder of the whole world. Even with all the tourists and retail bustle, it's a fantastic place. To be continued.
Your portrait can be of a friend, family member, or yourself and we will have different drawing materials for you to choose from. We encourage you beforehand to see works from the exhibition–look at the different points of view artists use, the way their subjects are posed, their facial expressions, etc. What feeling do you get from these portraits? If you are looking at a black and white portrait, how would it feel differently if it had been done in color, and vice versa?
3. You know the deal, I often rattle on about something that's on my 'wishlist' for a good while before actually buying it. This isn't something I necessarily like about myself as it's probably a long-term side effect of all those Alvin Hall money programmes I used to watch with my Mum when I was little. But as my last set of headphone have just given up the ghost, I finally bought a pair of Koss Porta Pro Stereo Headphones after I saw a girl last year wearing a pair on the bus in Manchester and looking all Natalie Portman and 'deep in thought'. It's like a revelation wearing these headphones! I hadn't realised I'd been previously subjecting myself to shoddy quality music listening. "Have you heard of this new band? I've been listening to them all week. They're just so unique and, and..tinny.." Alas, no more tinny music, no more..
If you enjoy crafts, you can probably find LOTS of things that inspire you! It seems that is the way it is with crafters, in general. We can find TONS of stuff on the internet (pinterest, for instance) or in magazines, or on television, calendars, cards.....even in coloring books! :D

It was a valid question, and it reflects a mistake a lot of us make. I frequently feel that if I were really, really committed, I would been in that orphanage with him, doing the hard, messy, selfless, service work. But I would likely be as unhappy as he was, because there is nothing in me that points in that direction. None of my gifts, none of my life experience, none of the things that give me joy. Trying to live out someone else’s vocation— no matter how cool or impressive it sounds— doesn’t honor God, or the individual.

The inspiration for Miriam Cohen's two books about sisters Mimmy and Sophie came from her own girlhood in Brooklyn. Side by side the books are physically very different. The first Mimmy & Sophie,is a large picture book, every inch filled with colorful illustrations in a storyboard layout. The sequel, Mimmy and Sophie All Around the Town, is an early-level chapter book with numerous black and white line-drawn illustrations. Tomas F. Yezerski illustrated both books.

That's the other thing about the holiday season. The restaurant undergoes such a huge influx of customers, usually all at the same time in big waves, that it definitely puts strain on the kitchen. I would say that they do a great job 99% of the time during the entirety of the year, but during the holidays, things start to fall through the cracks. Trust me, they still to a great job, but you start to see about 4% more issues.

But then Mumbai is a different kettle of fish, and while its city planners had accounted for it in the beginning, as is evident in the gardens, and parks and other formerly open areas, the caliber of governance in recent years, influenced in no small measure by the suspect quality of people elected to positions of power, has seen a steady deterioration to a point where birds are reduced to living on the pages of a book.
I advised her that at this point in her professional career, she should focus on writing the best novel she possibly could. Plenty of time to get the social media cranking while it's on submission.

Many years ago I put forward this theory to a bunch of friends in the pub whilst out with Geri (my Number 6). At the end of the night we went home and fucked (I can’t say that for certain, but we fucked a lot, so it’s a pretty safe assumption) and nothing more was said on the subject. Until a few days later, when Geri presented me with an elephant posing pouch and a pink men’s G-string.
The first 2/3rds of Cataclysm really tried my patience as a resto shaman healer. Let me rephrase that: it tried my patience as a competitive shaman healer — not competitive as in wanting to beat up other healers, but in that I like to perform at my top potential.
Crayola Outdoor Colored Bubbles aren't ordinary bubbles. Because they contain color, they're messy and will leave temporary colorful marks on skin, cotton and cotton-blend clothing and intended outdoor surfaces. This took some moms by surprise when they used the product last year. They loved the idea of bubbles in different colors, but weren't expecting them to be messy. Crayola quickly acted on parents' feedback and created a new version that keeps all the fun for kids and makes clean up easier for parents. Color magically rubs off skin, hoses off of many outdoor surfaces and washes out of cotton and cotton blend clothing.

But whether it’s something being sent to me free of charge or a purchase being shipped to me, I love getting things and particularly getting things in the mail. Sometimes I think that half of the reason I order stuff on ebay is not really the cheaper price, it’s the ability to get the thing in the mail. It’s like presents all year long!

I feel the major downside to both the shampoo and conditioner was that it just wasn't conditioning enough, I felt I always had to follow with the serum and yet even with that I still had tangled hair. I also found that my hair would tangle easy at the back throughout the day (this occurred mainly near the nape of my neck through to the ends, probably from rubbing on collars etc)..
McCarten chooses his words carefully and uses language appropriate to the period. I have no doubt that purists will find something to criticise but I’m not one of those. McCarten admits to artistic license, but who is to say if his Thomas Edison is not an accurate portrayal or a complete and utter fabrication? At the end of the day it is a novel, it’s made up of lies that somehow transform into various truths when the covers are opened. I make no bones about it, this is not a book I would have picked up in a bookshop, but that’s why I do these reviews because you never know what is going to electrify you in the nicest way possible or be a shock to the system. This one was … I’m sorry, I’m going to be predictable again and say it … just brilliant.
Or, at least I claim not to care about the work, while at the same time I'm throwing myself headlong into it. Is it just that too much of my ego and too many fears about my livelihood are wrapped up in the work I do for pay? Or is something else going on? All last week I was haunted by my apparent inability to answer for myself the question Summer Pierre asked at her blog last Monday: "What the hell DO I care about besides MYSELF?" Perhaps if I could answer this question more clearly, I wouldn't be so likely to lose myself in work.
In the coming months God continued to confirm these to me... Through His word, other people's comments, the Bible studies I was in, and praying with others, it was just amazing.
My first stop was an accidental stumble across the San Miguel food market (Mercado De San Miguel) located at Plaza De San Miguel. Only just a short stroll from Sol, the market houses many small stores which sell everything from fresh produce, meats and seafood, tapas, dessert and drinks. Open from early to late (past midnight), I went in during lunch time to try some local delicacies.
There isn’t much down there to work with a hoe. Of course, a hoe also requires a clear head. I want to keep the plant that are already doing so well. So, there’s no need to use the hoe today.
“It feels good to be able to provide quality entertainment and create memories that the fans will take with them,” Moss explained. “We’re able to give even more when we can help provide funding for a Habitat for Humanity house or new computers for the school library, and that feels great.”
We are told the focus when writing the words is on "the ART". Because it's calligraphy. ART. And its tools, 'Artists' tools. The Nib is trimmed to a certain type of point. Very important. Mystical. And the creation of paper made calligraphy even better. Paper was from China, the China of the Islamic Caliphate. But also, God speaks thru pen to paper. A meditation. Looking to see the divine. The Divine Presence in the Words.

(Of course, it's also very much worth pointing out that dividing autism up into any 3 "sections" is itself thoroughly arbitrary, and by conceptualising things slightly differently it could probably just as easily be split into 2, 4 or any other number of major aspects - it's purely because of the existing phrase "triad of impairments" that i've chosen 3 as the number to go with here...)

I'll be reporting back to you all about these training videos as I'll be downloading a few after I figure out how the hell I get the image from my laptop onto my TV. I'm about 80% there trying to figure it out, but thank God my friends fiancee gave me some techie advice. Guess my TV wasn't recognizing the laptop, or vice versa. Whatever. This kind of stuff is a bit like speaking Japanese to me. Or, like speaking techie.
Done and its time to head home.
The landlord of the house where I live is also Romanian. He’s doing well; he has a lot of properties in and around London. So he offers R a job renovating one of these properties. Great: R gets the work that will keep him going until his manager gets him onto a new project. Except there’s a bit more to it than that: the landlord gets R to do a job which R estimates should pay 2000 pounds, and pays R 1000 pounds. R doesn’t complain because he’s grateful to have that much and a roof over his head.
The second sentence is found in Pirqei Avot (1:14): “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?” He teaches us to take responsibility for ourselves, for if we don’t do it ourselves, then who will? We need to be focused on our own needs, to attempt to improve our lives and our manners. But if we only focus on ourselves, then what are we? We can’t stop with the self, we also have a responsibility to relate to our fellow human beings (don’t do to others what is hateful to you, don’t ignore the needs of others, when you yourselves would hate to have your needs ignored. We are not alone in this world, human is a social being). And we need to act now, in this moment. We don’t know what the next moment will bring.

My inbox has been flooded with emails about all kinds of things that have been on my mind to make these things happen, from travel to writing to making your dreams come true and creating your own reality. Facebook has articles and quotes popping up all over the place. I guess they could have been there all the time, but now I’m finally ready to listen. Not just listen, but DO.
“That is correct,” Wei replied.
So this is my little cautionary tale for today. Slow down, breathe, walk slowly. Take time to enjoy nature. Put the mobile device away when you go walking, or better yet, leave it behind. Appreciate moments of connection with nature, with family and friends. Practise random acts of kindness, not out of a sense of duty or obligation, but just because. And don’t let obligation to others completely obscure your commitment to personal health and well-being.
Records have potential to develop game spirit. Records always inspire player to perform extraordinarily but have managed to boost cricket spirit. Cricket is more than a game. It is a web based audio transmission of various other issues in a match is being played in any other thing that they do no have quality time to time. Players, coaches and selectors had to resign for bungling of fund of cricket podcast download. The cricket enthusiasts forget their daily work and sticks to his/her television set.

They try every effort to provide every other information related to this service for a game that whenever a tournament takes place, fans always find some or the uk cricket tickets can actually be anything. It can be kept for further references.

We would occasionally meet up at a department store in Oxford Street and chat about some of the authors and collectors he had met. Bill and I collaborated on an article for The Book and Magazine Collector which was my first paid feature. More importantly, he talked about some of the nuts and bolts of doing research, like going to Somerset House to find birth, marriage and death information, or Companies House to try and find information about publishers.

Obama is going to force you to purchase insurance, but the CBO won’t count the cost of one penny of that spending, now or ever. If you send money to the government that the government requires you to send them, that’s a tax. If the government spends money, that counts as spending. But if the government forces you to send money to a private health insurance company, that isn’t counted. It amounts to a tax that isn’t “deemed” (there’s a good word these days) a tax.
You may notice that the event has been scheduled for 15:00 because it will take them that long to get out of bed, throw on some dirty clothes, brush their teeth, huff a spleef and pack their iPods, iPhones and iPads away before sliding into their flip flops and beginning the hunt for their car keys or convincing mom to give them a ride downtown. Of course, the trip will entail a visit to some politically correct restaurant for a bite to eat and the obligatory $5 cup of coffee to fortify them for the event.
In Britain it was the Liberals who, under Lloyd Georgem insisted on Partition in Ireland and pushed for a Zionist settlement in Palestine.

I know that I’m beating a dead horse here, but watching a certain show for the sake of pretension doesn’t make one better than anyone else. If that is the case, then Strike Witches would be a masterpiece. It would be revered for its story about the feminization of war, and its undertones of world peace. But because it consist mostly of moé characters and the fact that they are “not wearing any pants,” it is considered “fanservice crap” in the eyes of the western fanbase. Madoka Magica would get a lot more praise than it already has for giving a dark new take on the magical girl genre. However, it still gets a lot of hate for what it is, and is dismissed for having “underage girls.”
My first task for the day was to head up & back down Cane Creek trail. It's about 1.5 miles from Campsite #2 up to the park boundary. I left my pack hanging from the bear cables at the campsite and just took some snacks and water with me. The trail is an old road and is wide and rutted, but passes through beautiful woods.

As MP knows, it's always who knows when it comes to my food inclinations. I remember a moment in our first month in Oklahoma when all I wanted was ice cream, but he didn't believe it after months of me not wanting ice cream in Minnesota (I wanted sorbet back then). Fast forward to now, and I'm eating pastry for breakfast, a meal I didn't know existed a week ago.
Fluids too must be taken in ample quantities.They include water, fruit juices, soups, thin porridge, buttermilk,milk etc can be included along with the balanced diet.Limiting the consumption of caffeine is also recommended.Alcohol is to be avoided.Though fluids are necessary one need not freak out. Drink amply when thirsty and remaining hydrated is the key to maintaining a healthy fluid balance.

the poems here as rooted to place and identity as the soil itself. In works such as “He Who Says The Name of God Will Perish,” Smith, with the same patience toward recovering ourselves as “Evening in the Heartland,” asks, “What is life / when we cannot reach out and feel our skin against the cold stone of night / and find the warmth we do not find within ourselves” (p. 260)?

One day, a huge tumbleweed blew on the road and after checking to be sure it was safe, one of them scampered out and took a look. I wished I'd taken a photo of it staring up in wonder at this weed (the size of a bicycle tire) which suddenly appeared in the roadway.

I felt humbled that I was unable to heal myself when I’d told my son that healing was easy to do. It was callous and arrogant of me. I am so interested in health and healing, but how can I teach and lead other people when I’m not able to figure out this journey myself?

I will live the rest of my life and never forget how you looked that night. I acted like it was the tux that made it hard to breathe but it wasn’t; it was you. I had loved you since I was four but seeing you like that; I knew I was going to marry you. You felt it too, I saw it. It wasn’t an instant change but there were moments of silence and awkwardness where there never had been before. Pauses when it felt like we should kiss but you would punch me instead. I knew you needed time. I had fourteen years to get used to the idea; you were just beginning to realize there was more to us. You are a very lucky girl that I am such a patient man, Kadie Daniels.
The collection is simply, beautiful. The details, exquisitely done, are great to get lost in. I know I’ll see pieces from the collection on the red carpet. There’s such a great mix of fantasy in the clothes. I see knight’s armor, Tudor elegance, and ethereal Goddesses. Again, I love Marchesa. They know how to make feminine creations with an edge that ups the femininity and grace. This is clearly evident in this collection.
Practicing in your paintball gun.

The point is that JS revealed himself in these letters to friends and acquaintances, and I cannot think of the last time I truly received a sense of someone through any electronic means. It's always, ALWAYS superficial. I watch people talk about their friends and their "communities" but they have no idea who any of their neighbors actually are. They show no real interest in the PEOPLE who are next to them, that live with them. Rather this desire and longing for connection is placated by the hope that these electronic connections with people we never see, never touch, never feel, never smell, never laugh with, never hold, never pick up, never help are more real and these people are closer to us than the people with whom we could actually share these experiences.

Now let’s leap to Mars and observe a Martian as described by Major James R. Randolph, engineer, mathematician and physicist, who taught at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, N. Y., and Rhode Island State College and lectures extensively on interplanetary subjects. This is his conception of a Mars inhabitant: He has slender arms and legs, a large chest, wide, flaring nostrils and a broad mouth. His head would be about a quarter the size of his body; his eyes would be dark-adapted, with wide pupils. His size is problematical” Major Randolph’s guess is that he would be about four feet tall but he frankly admits there is no real basis for the assumption.

Rewrites and Revisions: How much did you have to do throughout the writing of THE BLACKHOPE ENIGMA?
It's such an outrageous story that one is reminded of Josef Goebbels' famous dictum that "the bigger the lie, the more people will believe it." This story, improbable as it ought to have seemed to anyone with common sense, somehow went halfway round the world before truth could get its boots on. Several Egyptian reporters/bloggers and an American or two have gradually reconstructed where this grotesque report came from, and I am trying to summarize all their findings here.

Oh man, forget it. If you want to hear a bunch of ridiculously talented musicians gathered in one swing jazz band, check this CD out. According to the 1,001 Albums book, the original recording of this live show was so flawed that Columbia sent Duke and the band into a studio to re-record the material. What eventually came out was a fusion of live recordings, studio re-recordings and canned applause. Then, in 1999, the album was reissued as a two CD set with the original live recording and that fusion album that came out 55 years ago. Pretty cool move, since it gives listeners the chance to A/B the two versions.
It’s called the “New Millennium Poll Tax.” And it is not only unconstitutional, it’s illegal and illogical; and it should be.
Is it worth it? I won’t know for a year or two or ten if I’m going to be a successful author, so right now, I’ll leave you with the daunting facts: one and a half to two million books are written every year. 150,000 are published (about half of those are self-published), and since many carry over from year-to-year, I figure that at least a million are being peddled as we speak. 75% of published books (including some with big advances) sell less than 500 copies. 85% of published book sell less than 1000 copies. 84% of books in a bookstore sell less than 2 copies. A book is considered successful if it sells a total of 5000 copies. Considering the time it takes to write, edit, and promote, that comes to about $1.00 an hour for the author. Woohoo. (And that doesn’t take into consideration the sometimes hefty amounts people shell out for conferences, editing, classes, etc.)
THE PRESIDENT: Well, let me distinguish between professional politicians and the public at large. The public is not paying close attention to the ins and outs of how a Treasury option goes. They shouldn’t. They’re worrying about their family; they’re worrying about their jobs; they’re worrying about their neighborhood. They’ve got a lot of other things on their plate. We’re paid to worry about it.
The pet therapist arrived with her lovely Shepard-mix Kola, a sweet dog who lets anyone touch her. Therapy dogs have to have a very particular temperament. They can’t be skittish or aggressive, biters or lickers, distractable or aloof. They have to be friendly and approachable. Kola was all of these, the type of dog that lets anyone pet her. As such, she’s a perfect therapy dog. Her big soulful eyes help a lot too.

Gentlemen, we are all more or less proud of our past Indian civilization, but we actually do not know the real nature of that civilization. We cannot be proud of our past material civilization, which is now a thousand times greater than in days gone by. It is said that we are passing through the age of darkness, the Kali-yuga. What is this darkness? The darkness cannot be due to backwardness in material knowledge, because we now have more of it than formerly. If not we ourselves, our neighbors, at any rate, have plenty of it. Therefore, we must conclude that the darkness of the present age is not due to a lack of material advancement, but that we have lost the clue to our spiritual advancement, which is the prime necessity of human life and the criterion of the highest type of human civilization. Throwing of bombs from airplanes is no advancement of civilization from the primitive, uncivilized practice of dropping big stones on the heads of enemies from the tops of hills. Improvement of the art of killing our neighbors by means of machine guns and poisonous gases is certainly no advancement from primitive barbarism, which prided itself on its art of killing by bows and arrows. Nor does the development of a sense of pampered selfishness prove anything more than intellectual animalism. True human civilization is very different from all these states, and therefore in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad (1.3.14) there is the emphatic call:
BUT--these children of ours, the ones who make us mothers, can sometimes need things. Crazy, right? And often times their needs don't match up with our to-do lists or planned out schedules.

I did the candling technique on this box....loved how it came out. I painted it all in brown. Then rubbed a candle on the edges and parts of the box. I then painted it blue over the top. Once dry, I sanded the areas with the wax from the candle. It gave it a distressed look. Then I took a wet paper towel and dabbed on vintage photo distress ink and rubbed it all over the box. Tinted the hardware with alcohol inks. Then I blinged out the box :)
Country music is usually considered a last outpost of White music genres (although it's been subjected to enforced diversity as well). Classical music is also a European/White genre, despite the fact that Asians have taken it up in their imitative way.

or two, until the habit of choosing the right foodstuffs is ingrained. The easiest way of doing this is to plan your meals based on information gleaned from a book made especially for diabetics. This is similar to, but not the same as, the way the Atkins Diet works in that you must count carbohydrates and especially the fast-releasing carbs – the ones that give your blood-glucose level spikes.

details police threats, phone confiscations, detentions, felony charges and convictions of citizens for the 'crime' of recording officers on duty. Yet, laws are vague and vary greatly from state to state. The central issue revolves around whether taping police without their consent is a violation of wiretapping statues, and whether police have a reasonable expectation of privacy in public encounters with citizens—or if they are to be held accountable for their actions on the job.

With the down and back section it was mile 67 by the time I left Dutchman for the last time. As I was making my way down the fire road I heard my name called. It was Kathleen Egan who had traveled from Seattle to pace Larissa Polischuk. Larissa had been battling ITB Syndrome for weeks. She was able to get in two good long runs in training and got clearance from her physical therapist to run but the course and it's wet muddy state was too much for the knee. Larissa dropped at 42 but told Kathleen to search for me as I was running without a pacer. Kathleen had just pulled in as I was leaving the station, it was meant to be. Like Joe, it was my first time running with Kathleen and like Joe I was totally blessed for the company and the help. Kathleen was great conversation but she also knew when not to talk and let the running and walking be the conversation. Her company was especially welcome between mile 83 and 93, the distance between two aid stations. A 10-mile distance between aid stations seems like an eternity at night, towards the end of a 100-miler when you're tired and when 7 miles of it is uphill. At mile 88 we turned into a single track for the last of three down and backs. For two miles we made our way to Wagner Butte and runners we encountered warned us of the slick rocks. I thought that was strange. I mean we are all trail runners here, how slick are these rocks? Well let me tell you. At the end of the trail there were indeed rocks and some shrubbery that obscured the view of the top from the trail. I assumed the flag was at the top so I told Kathleen to just wait where she was while I went and got the flag. Wow... I went up and was laughing and staring with disbelief at what they had us doing for this last flag. The boulder pile is about one and a halt stories high and at the top is railing from a lookout point. We had to climb up, get across the railing, grab the flag then head back down. Not a big deal in daylight, not even a big deal at night, but it was a bigger deal after 90 miles of travel plus rain. I called out to Kathleen to come back and see for herself. I thought it was unsafe but whatever, one could argue the running trails with a lot of bear scat is also unsafe - there were a few nice piles of bear poop during the day.

From the last few months it has discussed advertising in video games, reality and video games, time-consuming achievements, hard games and e.t.c.

One thing I kind of admired when I saw a Canadian conservative on TV the other night. His honesty. He made no bones about it. He as much as said he just doesn’t care about the poor. He’s a complete vulture capitalist and did not apologize for it, did not try to hide it behind straw men arguments based around someone else’s sexual preference or other social issues that had absolutely nothing to do with, for example, cutting social programs. That, at least, made things clear. Honesty and it’s ugly head.

I’m ridiculously shallow and callous when it comes to matters of the heart. I sometimes get the impression that I’ve forgotten how to truly feel. But I know that’s a lie I tell myself. I’ve been masking my emotions since I was a child. Paying for the sins of those who were meant to love me the most. I’m afraid to remove my mask. It’s a truth that floats to the surface, when I’m alone, and I’ve let my guard down. But I suppress it, tie it to the anchor of denial, and watch it slip beneath the murky waters of my mind. I don’t like to dwell. Reflection leads to recrimination.

Dour is not a switch or if it is it’s more like a dimmer switch than an on/off switch. Would a dour bugger stick on The Best...

This is the point of the book Made to Crave by Lysa TurKeurst. Well, one of the points, anyway. Lysa points out in her book that we don't have to be imprisoned by our cravings, chained by the choices that face us every day. God made us to crave: HIM. The entire focus is that we shift our cravings from ones for cookies and chips and fried chicken (my weaknesses) to ones for Him using prayer and scripture. And the best part is, in reality, it has less to do with weight loss and food, and everything to do with your spiritual relationship with the Father.

I’d never had this salad before then, and it has become one of my favorites. It’s like the best of a green salad and a fruit salad combined. It is so refreshing. I know people who don’t like sweet things in their green salads, but these two berries are flavorful without being that sweet. And there’s something about the deep green, blue and red colors together that just looks nice. If you add enough berries, you almost don’t need dressing. Plus, I got lucky this week because strawberries and blueberries were both 99 cents at grocery outlet, so this salad was incredibly cheap to make.
6) If Jesus is Lord then Caesar is not. If we make the statement that Jesus is Lord, in other words that God is the source of power for human advancement, transformation and rescue then quite clearly human political power is not.

We do not seek the good, peace and prosperity of our city through government officials we seek it through the practice and promotion of discipleship.

When you are in an abundant mindset, your energy vibrates at a much higher level than one of scarcity. You then attract people and situations that vibrate at that similar abundant level, you then have the combined energy vibration of abundance and more of the same is attracted to you, and so it goes on. Likewise, if you live in a scarcity mindset, you will attract others who are in a similar mindset and you will have the combined scarcity mindset that will attract more and more of the same.

My problem here is one that has been mentioned many times, and that’s the issue of Elisa’s weight. I absolutely love seeing a heroine who’s both a POC and not perfectly fit, but so much of her self-hatred is based in her weight, and much of it - both self-hatred and weight - disappears once she experiences near literal starvation in the desert. I always enjoy seeing a character come into her own, but I would have loved it so much more if Elisa came to love herself and respect herself as she was at the beginning of the story. She’s brave before she loses weight, but she becomes a respected leader afterwards. I think the entire character journey could have been so much more powerful done differently.

I don’t mean that last comment as a joke, by the way. If mythology can be defined as the set of stories that people in a given society use to make sense of the universe and themselves, contemporary beliefs about the future of technology in the cultural mainstream of the industrial world fill that role, doubled, tripled, and in spades. Those of my readers who have come to take the challenge of peak oil seriously, and tried to discuss it with family members, coworkers, and friends who haven’t yet grappled with the issues themselves, can testify just how forcefully most of these latter cling to the belief that some technological gimmick or other will bail us out.

So I considered at the end there other ways this can be displayed.
The reason of the limitation is that if Congress were in position to act it would not be necessary for it to make such legislative delegation to the President, for Congress may in all cases act, declare its will and, after fixing a primary standard or yardstick, authorize the President to fill up the details by prescribing administrative rules and regulations to cope with the actual conditions of any emergency; and it is inconceivable that there may arise an emergency of such a nature that would require immediate action and can not wait, without irreparable or great injury to the public interest, and action of the legislative in regular or special session called by the Chief Executive for the purpose of meeting it. If in the United States they could withstand and have withstood all kinds of emergency without resorting to the delegation by the legislative body of legislative power to the Executive except those of administrative nature, because no such delegation is permitted by the States and Federal constitution, as above stated, there is no reason why the same can not be done in the Philippines. The frames of our Constitution and the national Assembly that enacted Commonwealth Act No. 671 are presumed to be aware of the inconvenience and chaotical consequences of having two legislative bodies acting at one and the same time.

Gatherings Magazine posted a question to it's followers last week on it's facebook page. "What is your favourite Christmas colour scheme?"

It's generally the first thing (right around Halloween) that comes into my brain, and typically I don't sway much from the first inspiration.

Misha, on the other hand, is heading back to the States to his home in Buffalo. There, he will pamper himself – he’ll adopt the sleeping habits of the average household cat, watch Scrubs because it is indeed good for the soul, and eat classic American cuisine like a triple-fried cheeseburger with XL chili cheese fries and frisbee-sized quadruple-fried onion rings on the side. No jalapeno mayo? Send it back! All this while “exfoliating”, whatever that means. The truth is, with the stresses this kid has, everyone would do the same thing. So I applaud him for publicly announcing that he fully intends on getting his eyebrows tweezed and giving his pores extra, extra attention. While he’s at it, that uneven farmer’s tan could use some persistent hours in the sun. But his goal is an honest one – to enjoy his few fleeting moments away from work, school, and exhausting backpacking trips in which basic plumbing is cause for overt joy. And for this, no one can blame him. Misha, I wish you many hours of Scrubs, sauna therapy sessions, and saturated fats! Sincerely, reliably, your very own Dr. Cox.

It's been a busy week with something happening most days. The biggest news is that yesterday, Mikey went to the dentist and had his brace fitted. I don't have a photo as that seems a bit unkind, especially as he's still getting used to it, but it's HUGE. He has a brace on his top jaw and also one on his bottom jaw with the purpose of making his whole bottom jaw move forward and bite in a completely different place. Thankfully, he can take it out to eat (I really don't think he could chew with it in as his jaws can't close!), but the rest of the time, including at night-time, his brace stays in.

Superstar athletes, actors and musicians, often portrayed among the super-rich, accounted for about 3 percent of the top 1 percent from 1979 to 2005, far less than the less glamorous people (mostly men) who lead and advise America’s businesses.
More to the point, these kinds of people are typical of the elitist, snobbish buffoons who like to portray themselves as the pillars of society. They know in reality that their lifestyle requires the hard work and sacrifice of other, and even the shedding of blood in some instances. They just don't want to have to know about it in detail, and in fact, they have a visceral reaction to the very people their very lives depend on. They want to pretend that they are too civilized, above all that, while people who live the life of the Palins are to their way of thinking too common, too crude, to regard seriously as their equals, when the fact of the matter is, people like the Palins are their superiors in every way that matters.
Some things are created purely by an inner impulse and not consideration of some external or clearly articulated goal. Art isn’t only those things that by luck or intention find their way onto a community’s pedestal or stage. Its what humans do with their imagination. Creativity often discovers itself as an act of expression. Just ask every child with a crayon. There is no intrinsic difference between the imagination that creates things to be shared and invents things to be held privately. Creativity is just basic to human nature. Sometimes art making can be as primal as scratching an itch….

Rocket Science and City of God were recommended to me by friends who though the movies were "me". Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring is a Korean movie that has been praised for its lush cinematography and profound message.

All of this will happen, just as surely as mushrooms will sprout forth from horse manure in a dark place. It is what always happens, when a Gangster Government veering toward outright fascism is assisted by a compliant press. Study the past decade in the political life of Venezuela, to see America's future. Secret police, and eventually even death-squads made up of "off-duty" agents and their cartel and street gang "informants" will proliferate. Violent street mobs aimed and directed by federal instigators through cutouts will be unleashed on political enemies, while the Feds and the elite media study their fingernails. These are a few examples of what always happens under these conditions. It is as predictable as the swing of a pendulum.

A couple of events planted the seeds for this plan. The first was a job listing for a Bloomberg policy analyst whose responsibilities would be to keep up on federal, state and academic discourse relating to my clients’ industry, as well as recent legislation and regulation and their commercial effects, and then write about it. I REALLY liked this job. Unfortunately, it was geographically undesirable. Just the same, it got me thinking: the fact that I don’t like the practice of law doesn’t mean that I can’t use this opportunity to gain first-hand expertise in what I really do like: the industry in which my clients work, and the government policies behind the laws that shape their business practices. As boring as it may sound, if I could give more detail, you’d see that it really is pretty cool.
I'm grateful for the unconditional love of our 4 legged friends: Jessie the blonde lab, Nico the tabby cat, Lily the black and white cat. Comforting on a low day...joyful always!

You have time to cover outlets or get gates for stairs. Your concerns for your child’s welfare are good, but don’t go overboard. There are some things, like the ceiling fan, that by the time the child can reach it, he should know better than to mess with it. But that falls under good parenting not childproofing.
Cockily, I (dressed only in a bikini that someone should have stolen and burned) waded in, expertly dodged the waves and was out beyond the surf in no time. The cross-current was perfect for allowing a good long swim without the dreary necessity of actually going anywhere. 'Heavenly' I thought to myself, swimming endlessly on the spot 'being able to stretch my muscles like this'.
I can feel things that are usually brushed away and sealed under a welter of practical tasks.
We numbly met with the Attorney and the D.E.’s, we requested documentation for recommendations for a Young Adult RTC,So that we may work on Individual contracts between Medicaid and Health and welfare. Other options we are seeking are that of our church as well as I have spoken to a number of parents that have succeeded in having the school district, due to a child’s special needs and incapability for regular schooling, pay for the RTC.

It has a lot to do with the fact that so much of our national discourse on important issues takes place in an entertainment context. The worst thing you can do, is to know what you’re talking about. If you know what you’re talking about, you’re not going to speak in sound bites. You are very rarely going to speak in sound bites if you know what you’re talking about. If you know what you’re talking about, most problems are very nuanced and very complicated.

Booktalk:This biography introduces the iconic American chef Julia Child to a new audience of young readers through the story of her spirited cat, Minette, whom Julia adopted when living in Paris. While Julia is in the kitchen learning to master delicious French dishes, the only feast Minette is truly interested in is that of fresh mouse! This lively story is complete with an author’s note, a bibliography, and actual quotations from Julia Child and comes just in time for the 100th anniversary of her birth. (It’s the first-ever children’s book about the beloved chef.)
You can easily ascribe which ostrich holes one party or the other will stick their heads into, which is again a problem in itself: no one speaks for me, no one speaks for you, no one seemingly speaks for America. Most politicians only speak for themselves and their "base." Until we quit electing career politicians and start electing true public servants we will continue to have severe problems in crisis situations. 9/11 was different in a sense, because we actually came together as a country. With respect to New Orleans, all there seems to be is finger-pointing and Soviet-style blame-passing.

8. Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction: How ironic that the world’s policeman for weapons of mass destruction is the only one to use them on a mass scale. The United States is on record using chemical, biological and even nuclear weapons. From the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in WWII, to Monsanto’s Agent Orange in Vietnam, to the depleted uranium used in Afghanistan and Iraq, America only condemns itself when speaking about the evils of WMDs. However, killers don’t appear to care how the killing is accomplished, so long as it achieves their goals. The real firecrackers will likely be brought out in a confrontation with Iran, or if China and Russia are lured into the conflict. It won’t really matter much what history says if the use of WMD escalates by either side, but the aggressors should rightly be blamed for the ensuing scorched earth, while the defenders against killers and thieves should be viewed as righteous.
The past is the past. The present is the present. This is not the witch initiation. His foes will be beatable.
A couple relaxes with glasses of wine, one resting on the sill, complemented by the exquisite air of warm evening, which has, after a long wet and cool spring, arrived at last.

Although the study acknowledged a rise in prices for electricity, mortgages, medical services, petrol, fruit, bread and vegetables they reckon it’s offset by falls in the cost of computers and audio-visual equipment. According to the report Prices These Days! The Cost of Living in Australia, we are spending more on discretionary items such as private school, restaurants, prepared food and holidays but the actual spending on necessities hasn’t seen a large increase.

And then there are people who ask us to do it soon because they are bored(!). I am not even joking. There are people who ask us to stop having fun as we have already had a lot and tie the knot soon. Talk about up-selling(not)! There are a few who are worried about my biological clock and are dreaming about my babies when I am not even sure if I want one.
However, my view is that marketing people could go a long way to achieving these goals without spending a penny on market research or witnessing or interacting with their customers. It’s simple, and they can do it without ever leaving their desks.

My ex looks good. He is a hot pretty boy, so it wouldn’t be hard. After the greetings he asks how I am. “Great”, I tell him. This should always be your answer. Even if you just lost your job. Even if you just got dumped. Even if you just lost your cat who helped you get over being dumped. Even if someone just died. Even if you gained four pounds by goin to 7-11 every day to buy candy. Even if your best friend just cut you in the stomach by getting the hook up to a Kayne West concert without inviting you!!!!! Everything is great. Great!

I was in Manchester some years ago, but just for an afternoon so I didn’t seen much. With Alix and Giuly I had a good time in the Greek restaurant, at Odeon cinema. It was my first time in a cinema out of Italy. It was a nice experience, I understood more than I expected. We visited the museum of science and industry, but overall the “Old Trafford”. We did the guided tour, we sat in the stadium, I took many pictures as you can see. Alix gave us her bed room and she slept on the sofa: I’ll never forget what you did for me and for Giuly. So you’ll be forever welcome in my house.
I guest posted at the Blogging From A to Z Challenge Blog on the 29th and failed to mention it here! (Life sort of went insane this week, so it's lucky I had pre-written this week's posts, which is usually something I don't manage to do, or there would have been no posts!)
I was struck by this the other morning when I was out walking my dog, and I took some photos of changes that spoil everything for everyone. They are not particularly extreme or unusual examples - just a taste of how much damage a little ‘improvement’ can do.

After the chaos has destroyed the country, the bankers plan to release a series of plagues and kill people until they calm down and accept slavery as their destiny.
Yes, I like a drink at the end of a long hard day but I’ve never drunk to excess or allowed it to affect my judgement. However, the Left don’t miss a trick at our expense, and saw this as a stick to beat me with. I would like to make clear I have never sought assistance from any AA group, nor have I needed to. Having a drink has never affected my work or professionalism. For those of you who feel that my speeches are somewhat ‘poetic’, that is just my character. Having said this, it has secured every success I have achieved for the Party, for my own area and across the nation both at branch meetings and at the RWB and throughout the country in canvassing campaigns.

The next piece of good news is that we get to keep him here until Monday. Originally, there was a chance that we would have to take him back to Riley tomorrow to start his second round, but the doctor wants to do a bone marrow test before his second round starts, and he feels that giving him time to fully recover will give us more accurate results. Sounds great to us - this means that we get to spend the rest of the week AND the weekend together! The home healthcare nurse is coming back out on Thursday to do another blood draw, but other than that he's pretty much just living the normal little boy life for now. So, we have big plans to do - well, nothing really, just love on our kids and try to rest up before kicking off Act II. I do think I am on the hook to finish the kids' swing set, and I probably should mow sometime, but other than that it is going to be a nice time together.

Our Traveling Day there was Gray / Black Day and on the way home it was Turquoise Day.
Libertarianism is the true art of finding common ground, by respecting all peoples as equal. A less eloquent way to put it is, you are free to swing your fist as hard as you want, until you connect with someone. Libertarians believe that all men are born free, and created equal. No matter what it is you want to do, you have the freedom to do so, as long as it doesn’t harm others. Doesn’t that sound like something we could use more of in this country?
So stop it, self. Let this be another one of those teachable moments and don't do it again.

Ever had that horrible sinking feeling when you realise that other people don’t see you as you see yourself? My epiphany came when I completed a small project back in my engineering days. It wasn’t a technically difficult project but it needed a large amount of co-operation from two plants with a history of blaming each other for every last thing, and that project worked right first time against all the odds. The project team were amazed when they’d done it yet none of the management team from either plant ever said ‘thanks’ and I never received any real credit for the project.
If you’ve been in a guild for any amount of time, you have stories. You know the ones I mean: they become guild jokes, nicknames, and when you need encouraging between wipes, they come up during AFK’s. I adore story time.

We drove further west to the Maple Leaf Bar, but they didn’t serve food and the music wasn’t starting until 10PM. Not much else was open on Oak Street, so we worked our way south to Magazine Street, which seemed like a brightly-light haven after we drove through dark streets lined with semi-abandoned warehouses. We followed Magazine for a bit until John and I simultaneously shouted “Nacho Mama’s!” An onlooker might have thought I was drunk since I bumped the low curb and then nearly cut off John’s hand with the power windows. We filled up on beans, cheese, rice, and veggies and still had food left over, so I decided to take some it with us to eat on the road the next day.
THE SECRET COURTYARD FROM GIGI
Chances are you’ve never heard of him, I had not. The reason this was ignored by the media is normal and rather obvious. The news media, including Fox News, would shake in their boots before exposing this in-depth. Glenn Beck did in an article in the Blaze. Fox News, without Beck, joined the other networks in fear of our government. Hopefully more Congresspersons will be willing to use their power to find similar events, before November. If not, it’s four more Obama years.

This possible contamination of our shared water supply could lead to the scenario where no one trusts the tap water anymore. A situation that has not been seen for an awfully long time in the UK. A situation that may lead to everybody having their own filtration and water purification system in their own home, filtering their incoming mains water, not just relying on their water company to provide clean, safe drinking water.

Sure, some of us are into natural foods or Eastern philosophies or tie-dyed shirts or liberal politics, and most of us value creativity. But the same could be said of just about any cross-section of humans—at least on the West coast! To attach any label other than "unschoolers" to such a diverse group is shortsighted and seems rather dismissive (even to someone who admires hippies).
In case you still doubted how big a deal this bankruptcy was, the phrase "national calamity" should definitely sway you.
That aside there is also the second definition: “the formal examination before a competent tribunal of the matter in issue in a civil or criminal cause in order to determine such issue”.
Listen, one day we’re all going to have to pack up and leave this body andwithout Jesus, you won’t be able to go where you want to go, which is Heaven. The only way to enter is by His blood and the only way out of your mess is by His blood. No Jesus, no life. I’m going to the gates of Heaven with one thing. When they ask me do I have the password, all I’, saying is “The Blood”. “I come here through His Blood.” “I didn’t live good enough to come through the Gates with what I did but Jesus did, and I show up here today with the Blood.” Hallelujah!!! That’s our only way in. The Blood still works.

Kyla Bidgood - We love that the house plans are specific to BC. They each have names like "The Shawnigan" or "The Seymore", and come with a description of how they suit BC climate and landscape. Most of the homes are still contemporary by today's standards and modest in size, which was a great aspect of design from that era. It's a perfect example of how good design truly is timeless.
I live so close to all of these great places in Ireland but I just never seem to make the time to go and see them So I decided that it was finally time to start checking them off my list.

So, I cleaned up some of the gargantuan mess, and I puttered around. I hung some stuff up on the walls, which is always soothing and satisfying somehow.

Comments/Context: Chris Wiley's photographs of found architectural geometries are executed with an exacting sense of compositional rigor. They are strict and precise, the juxtapositions of textures and shapes deftly controlled to maximize formal contrast in a two dimensional plane. While this nothing particularly new in photography, Wiley has taken this idea to near its logical extreme, crafting images with an undeniable affinity for visual structure, plucked from the chaos of city streets and pared down with almost mathematical austerity.
Now that you understand all of that, we can go deeper. First things first, God doesn’t hate the gays. He hates the sin, because it separates Him from His children. Secondly, I personally know that people who were born liking the opposite sex can and may get into Heaven.
Yet, in between, lurk those For Worse times. Lord, we struggle with those. The grocery store tantrums, the turmoil of that first broken heart, the wild arcs of teenage rebellion or withdrawal.

Mike pondered the full bottle of Vera Wang for Men sitting in his travel bag. As much as he wanted to make an impression on his breakfast date be it male or female, he simply could not break with tradition and wear cologne on a day he would be wine tasting. It simply was not done, and while Mike secretly hoped he would find himself ensconced in some carnal cocoon later that day he was not willing to sacrifice the aromatics of one of the world’s great wines for the sake of applied pheromones.
Showing dogs has made me a more patient and understanding person. Showing dogs can be the ultimate test of persistence, and it can frustrate you to no end. After all, the essence of handling a dog in the show ring is that you and the dog have to work together like a team. That's right. That animal that would rather hump your leg is supposed to do what you ask. Furthermore, that dog doesn't speak English. I tend to laugh when people complain about their students or their employees. At least human students and employees speak English (or another spoken language) and can be reasoned with in some logical fashion. A dog cannot. A dog does not care to learn your way of communication nor does the dog really care about what you want.

This kind of racist/chattel slavery has been explicitly condemned by the Church since it was first practiced in the middle of the 15th century. A series of Papal bulls forbade the expropriation and enslavement of indigenous peoples, and threatened with excommunication those who participated in them. Everyone from individuals to entire nations felt at liberty to defy these Papal pronouncements, but they were made. Had such things been clearly and universally sanctioned by Scripture, the Church would likely not have excommunicated those who innocently partook in them. But there was clearly something about chattel slavery that was in clear opposition not only with Scripture but with Tradition, with the natural law, and with common decency, hence the Church’s firm and repeated condemnation of it.

With the business in such flux, the choir of discordant voices is understandable. Look at how many titles are being cut by publishing houses, look at Border's current bankruptcy and the recent celebration of the rise of the ebook. Look at the drop in actual readership, and especially the drop in young readers. Look too at the manufactured author, the one chosen by a multinational corporation and promoted to godhood even before a book is released (not that I'm blaming Justin Cronin for jumping at the opportunity).

Not the very best picture, I know. Just want to show a photo taken from my camera phone yesterday. For any night shoot, I will highly recommend bringing along a tripod.
Our goalkeeper, Ryan Jones, was unhappy about Netley's goal. It came mid-way through the first-half, after an aerial challenge between himself and a Netley striker, who got to the ball fractionally earlier than Jones, who was left in heap, watching in vain as the ball trickled beyond his reach and over the goal line. Jones then made a memorable save as Netley pushed hard to increase their lead. A cross from their left was met by the head of an opposing striker, who as the coaching manuals suggest, headed the ball back towards the side of the goal it had arrived from. It is within these fleeting moments that Jones is in his element. In what looked as smooth as a choreographed stunt, he flung himself to his right, scooping the ball wide with the fingers of his right hand, when it seemed destined for the bottom corner of our net. It was of Netley's opinion that the game should have been dead and buried as we approached the final few minutes.

I guess that title may be a bit misleading. I guess I should specify, that through trade, I procured one bottle each of Russian River's new-to-bottle West Coast Hop Bombs. Yes, that is right, you're looking at a bottle of Blind Pig IPA and the highly coveted and critically acclaimed Pliny the Elder Imperial IPA.

Seeing a film in 3D for the first time is quite something, I was most impressed. How I looked, might be another matter entirely though! Also, I have to say it, I’m not sure I would like to watch sport in 3D, seeing a ball literally flying towards me would probably put me off more than any extra enjoyment I might get! Lets just say its something I’m glad I’ve done, but wont be rushing to repeat. But I suppose its like a lot of things, you get used to it in time, probably just me showing my age?

I may not have it all together but I am certainly going to focus more on educating and talking about Christ with my little ones this year. I am going to find every opportunity to serve others big or small. I am going to recommit myself to being a better disciple of Christ. I am going to find JOY this year as we celebrate the birth of our Savior.

All this is a powerful testimony of how David kept his heart free from bitterness, even when we was greatly wronged and sinned against. David fulfilled 1 Corinthians 13:5: love thinks no evil. David knew the principle of 1 Peter 4:8: And above all things have fervent love for one another, for "love will cover a multitude of sins."
So, for those of you keeping score, I'm going with yes there is a noticeable difference between Sierra Nevada Pale Ale canned and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale bottled. I'm not going to draw any conclusions at this point—the whole point of this is to see how a variety of beer perform against each other, So, for now I'll just keep it as a yes and we'll see how everything goes in a few weeks. Next go round we'll see how an imported ale fares, under the same circumstances.

Then slowly the sun began to peek around the edges of the grey clouds. As it pushed through the clouds lightened, the mood lifted. Out of nowhere, it seemed, a rainbow appeared. Red bleeding to orange and yellow into green and blue and then an indigo purple. A whole rainbow straddled the sky. It was a truly beautiful sight.

There was a vast, starry sky here last night. Somehow, when I look up into such a sky, I feel I can forgive humanity anything. It’s the cosmos as far as can been seen inside my head. It’s as though everything that I haven’t read and everything that I haven’t written and all the poetry I haven’t composed catches fire like a comet. My soul stretches out to infinity.

Well over on the SUGAR NELLIE facebook page, our Sugar Mamma make a joke about Cathy Wallington and Fiona Robertson having to make at least 6 entries in the 4 weeks the challenge was running, and well they both rose to the occasion and exceeded all our wildest believes, they both hit 9 cards if not more and each card was totally outstanding, so in the last few days they've been egging us other girlies to try and match them, well theres no way I can reach that number in that short a period of time, but I've had another bash and came up with this card..........

What I think makes this book unique is both the recipes ( I have not seen most of these recipes before) and the assembly of the cakes. The cakes are divided by season, emphasizing the tastes of each season. Summertime has you savouring a strawberry poppy seed cake, bora bora, a combination of vanilla joconde cake with coconut creme and beau soleil (beautiful sun) which is a hazelnut vanilla joconde with a mascarpone mousse and peach curd. For spring, you can enjoy Devika, rose flavored tortes with a raspberry gelee and rose whipped cream. Of course there is a lemon praline torte and Toute Fraises (everything strawberry) strawberry cupcakes. The Fall is offering you Blackberry cheesecakes and blood orange ricotta cake. For the winter you can enjoy Versailes (the cover cake) an almond joconde cake with a salted caramel mousse. Of course the winter offers you a Yule Log and rasberry white chocolate linzer torte. There are many variations of chocolate cake for each season.

As anyone who has read the posts about My Life knows, I’ve been a BIG fan of the space program for just about my entire life. In my very first post in the My Heroes volume of this blog, Inspiration, I included a video of the opening to Star Trek: Enterprise. You know, the one with all the wonderful sailing and NASA images. Even then, I was planning to write this one, not only as a tribute to the 40th anniversary of the 1st moon landing, but as a tribute to all of those who help make it possible.
You may think you've had a Hurricane if you sipped some koolaidy concoction at Pat O'Brien's, but you haven't had a real New Orleans hurricane until you've made it the original way, with just dark rum, lemon, and passion fruit syrup.

I thought I would post this out now as I can see the big clouds rolling in and I think there could be a chance of us being stuck indoors again for a couple of days. A couple of weeks ago we suffered torrential rain for a week or so and it was a total nightmare. After trying everything and anything to entertain the little ones, I searched some blogs and found this great puff paint recipe from I-mama. I was amazed by how simple this was to make and true to its word, after a quick blitz in the microwave the paint puffed up. We loved it; it was so easy here’s the recipe.

Life has been a whirlwind since moving out on my own at the beginning of February. I have been having so much fun that very little has been done to unpack boxes and organize my home. I have spent time with my sister, evenings with friends, I've gone to parties, and spent a weekend in Traverse City. I have also been talking to someone and spending some time with that person. That last one isn't something that I have exactly gone public with, but I write it to share the self-discovery that I have had.

Rather than doing that he made known in Colossians 2:14 that God took the law “out of the way, nailing it to his cross.” Rather he taught that all believers today “have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.” (2 Corinthians 5:1) Rather he preached that all true believers today are looking for the blessed hope, to be caught up to meet the Lord in the air, not here on earth.
The following photos were taken in and around the town's central plaza (parque central) which is adorned with columns on the northern and southern side and a round columned gazebo-type thing in the middle.

Horror Express was a Spanish production directed by Eugenio Martin. It was filmed in Madrid in the years 1971-1972, a low budget film ($300,000) with the luxury of having three familiar genre actors in the lead: Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and Telly Savalas. The film was co-produced by American filmwriter/producer Bernard Gordon, who had collaborated with Martin on the 1972 film Pancho Villa (which also featured Savalas in the title role). The filmmakers used both the miniature train and interior train set from Pancho Villa for Horror Express. The challenge was that they only had one set to be used as an interior train car. All of the scenes for each train car had to be shot at once, then the set would be rebuilt as the next car.
Hitler and the Nazis are rightfully condemned for the murder of millions of Jews during the Second World War, but most of the time the rest of Hitler’s victims are expunged from the historical record.
“Yo” (“Me” in Spanish) finds the Cuban maverick extending his remit beyond the natural borders of Afro-Cuban jazz and straying into the realm of traditional African melodies. The album’s opener “80’s” kicks off with an up-tempo piano riff supported by drum and guitar that will make the listener sway from side to side. This track is followed by the mellower “Bibisa” with guest singer Fatoumata Diawara, fresh from her own success with her debut album “Fatou”. A mid-song kora-piano dialogue adds to the beauty of this track. Things can only look up from there, and they do, indeed, as evidenced on “7 Rayos” (“7 Rays”), a percussion- and piano-driven melody that samples the voice of Cuba’s National Poet and one of the pillars of Afro-Cuban culture, the late Nicolas Guillén.

One of my fondest memories as a small child was hearing a firm and steady knock on our front door, and opening it to find a handsome, confident man in a dark suit standing tall and proud. He would always be smiling, often have a dashing, rakishly tilted hat on his head, and in a deep and pleasant voice would inquire as to the whereabouts of the Lady of the house. He would also be carrying a mysterious and fascinating item in his hands, or have a huge, shiny, complicated device sitting on the ground by his black and highly polished shoes. The item was either a modern, complex device for removing dirt from our carpet, or what I think was possibly a Russian space satellite, primed to make a blazing entry out into a geosynchronous orbit of our humble planet. Either way; the machines were soooo…… cool! He would talk for what seemed like hours about such interesting things as the incredible cyclonic, suction power of the amazing Dust Demon 5000, the wonderful quality of various cleaning products, or the importance of imparting the knowledge of books on young and impressionable minds.

Bob Miller, and much of the publishing fraternity, might baulk at the idea that paid-for partnership publishing is actually part of the traditional publishing industry--if perhaps, at best, being on the outermost peripheral--then, is all publishing not a partnership of a kind to greater or lesser degrees? Miller is content that the author keep their credit card tucked away in their jackets, but encourages and looks for perspective authors who have a unique book and voice and an understanding of how to sell both. Some of the debate following Miller's piece in PublishingPerspectives.com centres on the shared responsibility between author and publisher. There are publishers with--shall we say--less than 'nouveau' ideas about the place for the modern author in the marketing and promotion of a book - believing they still know best. The changing world of publishing and a reeling global economy may soon see the last of the great publishing pretenders.

“Blue Moon Brewing Company was born in 1995 in Denver, Colorado, U.S.A., when we added unique and subtle twists to old-world, handcrafted brewing traditions. Since then, not much has changed. Still just a bunch of friends having fun making great beer.” You can almost see the guys getting together on a Saturday to fire up a brew in the turkey fryer in the garage, can’t you? Poor sods probably have to stir the mash with a canoe paddle too.
Then, too, even some people who thought their retirement funds were adequate -- and safe -- saw those funds evaporate in the financial debacle of a few years ago. I guess that was their fault, too. Yes, throw them to the wolves for being so stupid.

My only, obvious, quarrel is that, already under fire for calling a 3.6% session beer IPA, they've now brought out two new beers that are very different from the original, obviously not India Pale Ales in any shape or form, and called them India Pale Ales. This reveals that as far as Greene King is concerned, IPA is a brand name and not a beer style. I could just about defend the mainstream GK IPA because while it's not a traditional IPA, IPA is an evolving style and in the mid-twentieth century this is what it was to most brewers and drinkers in the UK. But by calling these new beers IPA rather than just 'Greene King Blonde' or 'Greene King Reserve', GK have created a needless rod for beer enthusiasts to beat them with - a silly own goal at a time when they're doing some big things right.
It’s a spirit that the ANC government pays tribute to during their satanic rituals, and it’s the same spirit that keeps them in power. It will also be the same power that will place the next round of rulers in control, UNLESS we acknowledge the fact that it’s not such a clever idea after-all to worship many gods, and that certain powers beyond our control can only be defeated by ‘ONE SUPERIOR POWER’ that is far mightier than all those other ‘gods’ and evil spirits put together.

I’m inclined to doubt this because the rest of the movies are about quirky men. They’re odd, but they don’t feel inferior for all of that. Olive, from Easy A (2010), is the perfect example of what I’m talking about. She’s odd and isolated because of her intelligence and super wit, which, in the real world, hurt your high school experience (unlike the world in Juno (2007)). And, like the men in a RomCom, would super love to get with a nice, balanced character as a make-out partner, but events conspire against her/them.
When I was very little, I stood on his feet and he swung me around, pretty much carrying me through the steps. But as I got older, he taught me to waltz, and to polka, and to jitterbug. He taught me to stand up straight and move from my hips, and to let the music tell my feet what to do when, and he taught me the sheer joy of dancing with a partner. A touch of the hand on my back, a slight pressure on my waist, or a grasp of my fingers, and the rest of my body, and especially my feet, knew where to go and what to do, in sync with his rhythm. It was magical – it might very well have been magic.
The gastric plication is one of the more interesting obesity surgery innovations. Performed laparoscopically, the plication (also called the gastric pleat) does not involve a medical device, and there is no stomach tissue resection. The surgeon restricts the stomach with a special suturing procedure – a technique adapted from the surgery that most successfully treats GERD (gastroesophogeal reflux disease, a common co-morbidity of overweight/obesity). The plication results in faster weight loss than gastric banding – results compare to the weight loss results of gastric bypass patients, but with much lower risk of serious complication, and much less surgery time (about 50 minutes).

Bottom line is, get away from the everyday routine and start living again. Bring that adventurous spirit you had as a young couple, back into your relationship. You are only as old as you allow yourself to be. I am turning 50 in a few days, and the spark is still there, we believe that breaking the routine is very important to keep a relationship hot and moving. However, and I think it is important to keep this in mind, it is not always easy, we have two kids, both of us work, just like any other couple, but we make sure that we fit those alone together quality moments into our schedule, even if only once a week.

I was sitting here trying to get Lelo to sleep and thinking about what to blog about today. A lot has been happening, but I wanted to stray away from the regular dramatics of my daily life (Jimmy, Larry, kids, etc.). I wanted to find something funny to blog about. So I went on Facebook, because my friends sometimes have the most interesting/hilarious/tragic things happen to them. Then it hit me…. Thank you, Katherine!

1978 : May 5 Another former companion makes headline news. Katy Manning poses in the nude with a Dalek for a girlie magazine, and tells journalists: "I did it for the money. Iwas skint. I'd had two good holidays abroad, three months out of work - and to top it all, the VAT man was after me. So why say no when an offer like that is manna from heaven?" Of the photographs, she jokes: "I'd never pose for full frontal pictures. Anyway, why should there be a fuss about my going topless? To catch a glimpse of anything you'd pretty well have to put me under a microscope!" Jon Pertwee comments: "Typical Katy!"

This idea of trying to build a new society in the plazas and squares had absolutely nothing going for it.
