Human trafficking happens because prostitution is illegal ("House of ill-repute," July 29 ). Prostitution is illegal only because the majority of people don't like it.

Though a federal judge in a later case described Kearbey as "the ringleader of a fairly large methamphetamine distribution network," he served just seven days in jail. Instead he agreed to work as an informer, helping arrest a number of small-time meth cooks, according to the federal court records.

Well, it's important to keep developers happy and faithful in your up-and-coming OS. But really, you're meant to be assuring the people who are now locked into two-year AT&T contracts. Most of these people are eagerly showing off Windows Phone to their friends. Why would you want the last line of this endorsement to be "But for God's sake, don't buy one: Microsoft will release a major update in the fall and only new phones will run it. In fact, you might want to give Windows Phone a miss entirely, if their ongoing policy is to deny their existing users access to future OS features."
In a far riskier move, the director, working with screenwriter John Logan ("Gladiator," "The Aviator"), has chosen to stay with the syntax of the play while updating the rest of the production, which is both the charm and the challenge of "Coriolanus." But if you give yourself over to that clash of style and sensibility, something magical happens as the power, the prescience and the precision of Shakespeare's words take hold of modern problems.
"Newark, like Trenton, is an urban core with this suburban exterior," White said today. "Just west of here, there are thousands of bikes collecting dust in basements."
Buying the refinery "is an innovative approach to managing our largest expense," said Delta CEO Richard Anderson. He said it's a "modest investment" comparable to buying one new large jet aircraft.

The Harp Tree apparently was already old when Terry's great-grandpa arrived in the late 19th century. Born in Switzerland, well educated, a trained musician who delighted in playing his Stradivarius, Henry Scharrer chose to be a farmer and a fisherman. His visitors over decades included Cuban netters, shipwrecked sailors and tourists from the coast, the poet Carl Sandburg among them. Something happened to the pine to make the trunk split in a peculiar way. At least that's what Terry was told. Some folks say the Indians did it. The less romantic wonder if hurricane winds might have done the trimming. Anyway, the double trunk reminded people of the musical instrument.

"You've got to keep a body on him as much as you can," Gasol said. "He going to be active, he's athletic. So he's going to try to keep balls alive. He runs the floor really well. You've just got to try to match that intensity and try to make him work on the other end and see if he can guard in the post. Use your strengths against him."
Gregg, a retired lawyer, and Peter, a college librarian in Gainesville, Fla., drove to Everglades City a day early to claim our camping spots. Sam and I met them at the Ivey House, a historic B&B that served as our staging ground. Peter had been unable to secure our first-choice camping spot -- a so-called chickee platform on stilts about 8 feet above the water in one of the inland creeks, about a 10-mile paddle from the ranger station. So we chose a beach site on an island encouragingly named Jewel Key, due west, dead into the wind.

"Since the administrative costs of the division are paid from the same funding source as the advisers’ fees, the state pension funds, these savings would be reinvested and compounded," the audit said. "We recommend the Division of Investment be provided with the additional staff and travel resources necessary to forgo advisers’ fees and instead actively manage the emerging markets portfolio internally."

Never prolific statistically, Smith was considered a "Moneyball" find for Portland — a banger whose production resembled peers that commanded a lot more scratch. Problem is, once the Blazers claimed J.J. Hickson off waivers, the Rhino suddenly found himself in captivity.
It calls for talks between the opposition and the government in an "inclusive Syrian-led political process," a cease-fire and troop withdrawal, humanitarian assistance in areas affected by the fighting, the release of those who have been arbitrarily detained, free access for journalists and respect for "freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully."

Another gem is DeFuniak Springs, a sleepy town of 5,000 just off Interstate 10. I took a one-mile walk around Lake DeFuniak, which is ringed by gracious Victorian homes that recall a time when labor and materials were cheap and no architectural detail was too elaborate. At Murray's Cafe, I ordered a fried green tomato sandwich with a side of fried okra and watched a CSX freight rumble through town.

Back at camp, everyone seems to be getting along better, but there is a bit of sour grapes on the women’s side. Kim (Texas Girl) thinks that the men should have finished the challenge because it would have been the chivalrous thing to do, which just pisses me off. You’re playing a game, and you shouldn’t expect someone to give you an advantage just because you’re a woman. It’s a little different from someone opening the door for you.
The tournament will be played in Dallas in 2013 and Oklahoma City in 2014, when the conference plays its women's tournament a week before the men's. Unless the Sprint Center is available in future years, this might have been it for Kansas City.

Janis Stevens  fiery, confident, intense yet regal  stars as "Il Divina (the divine one)" in the extraordinary Capital Stage production that opened Friday. "Master Class" is not a one-woman show, but it might as well be. It's essentially a monologue interrupted by an interval and a series of cameos in which three aspiring singers take turns being alternately encouraged and discouraged by Callas. Even when she is not speaking, Stevens  as Callas  commands the attention. Director Jonathan Williams (whose pacing is precise throughout) and lighting designer Ron Madonia ensure that the diva, whether sitting or standing in the background, listening intently or lost in reverie, always is present. The eye can no more ignore her than the ear could ignore the voice of Callas.

Now the real challenge begins, which it will be to learn as much as he can, and try to get faster."

A wild-card growth opportunity is the possibility that Apple will release its own version of a television set. To be sure, the market for TVs is much smaller than the market for handsets. Households have more smartphones than they have TV sets, typically. And they replace their handsets at a more rapid rate. Yet Apple's top-notch product designers have an opportunity to streamline complicated on-screen menus and multiple remote controls. They can also cater to a small but growing segment of consumers that watch video content, but no longer subscribe to a cable package. Any TV sales would further entrench Apple inside households, possibly spurring sales of iPhones, iPads and Macs.

Smith: In the previous question, you said the arts is a real important part of the economy so how should we promote cultural tourism. I actually don't think the most important element of the arts in our economy is tourism. I think the most important element are things harder to calculate. It's not by accident that Wieden + Kennedy is in the Pearl District. There's a relatively famous lesson that explained the reason the United States won the space race was not because our engineers were better at math than engineers elsewhere. But because they had had art and shop and could access their whole brain to solve engineering problems. My hunch is, the most important element of our, of why the arts is crucial to the local economy is that it helps our workers, our people, solve problems and think about the world differently. Whether it's advertising or clean tech, we can compete in the global knowledge economy better.

After all, he was a geologist, not a bankruptcy attorney. And he hardly was a political juggernaut. He'd lost three races for Congress, a race for Vanderburgh County Council and a GOP convention fight for secretary of state. Until he won election in 2006 as state treasurer, his only prior political success was two terms as a Vanderburgh County commissioner from 1994 to 2002.

The Lakers, who got 40 points from Kobe Bryant on Sunday, hope to have Bynum on Tuesday, but the more important game will be Wednesday against the Clippers.

"The senator will remain in the hospital today," Lautenberg spokesman Caley Gray said, declining to answer additional questions.
President Obama has been criticized -- including in a Times editorial -- for his ahistorical statement that it would be "an unprecedented, extraordinary step" if the court overturned "a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress." The law in question, of course, was "Obamacare," and the president seemed to be trying to muscle the court into upholding it by lamenting "that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law." That was unseemly.
Van Gundy will be fired between now and the end of the season. There's no way he survives this dysfunctional episode. He probably was done in Orlando anyway despite his popularity with some Magic players and four straight playoff appearances that include a trip to the 2009 NBA Finals. Ownership and management almost always side with the star when he becomes at odds with the coach. When Howard agreed to stay for one more season, you had tofigure it was at the cost of Van Gundy's job.

Finally, after 40 minutes, crews arrived from Foster City and Belmont -- each already exhausted from battling fires and searching rubble in their own cities. To reach San Mateo, they navigated an obstacle course of fallen debris, cracked asphalt, traffic snarls, liquefied roadways. Through heroic efforts and good luck, the teams manage to save San Mateo's downtown -- but not a full block of shops, cafes and part of a gym.

Marriage between a man and a woman has its origins firmly grounded in the objective reality of human nature. Our human reason informs us that man and woman are made for each other. They complement each other physically and socially. Only the sexual union of a man and a woman can bring a new life into the world. Assistive reproductive technologies do not alter this reality any more than airplanes alter the reality of gravity.

That’s what made the last Olympics so important. Curling — invented in Scotland 500 years ago and a pastime second to hockey in Canada — didn’t become an Olympic medal sport until 1998. And if it was on TV at all, it was only on in the wee hours of the morning.

John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said the controversy boosts Republican criticism that the 2010 health-care overhaul backed by Obama was an over-extension of government. "This helps chip away at that accomplishment," Feehery said. That message is delivered most effectively when religious groups such as the Catholic Church lead the campaign against the rule, he said. "Having them as the messenger is important to Republicans."

I thought it was really good. It made me cry at the end. I really love that book. I like “Harry Potter.” I like many things that are thrown at me.

“We are pleased that the New Jersey Superior Court will allow us to show how civil unions fail to provide to same-sex couples the equality promised by both the New Jersey Constitution and the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution,” said Jon Davidson, legal director at Lambda Legal. “Having both a state and federal equal protection claim will only make our case stronger. We look forward to presenting a complete record of the discrimination that New Jersey’s same-sex couples and their children face because of their relegation to civil unions rather than marriage.”

He said this with confidence, but he plays a position that requires an attitude that borders on arrogance. He can’t have that yet. Yes, this is a supremely talented athlete — we all know that — and his name alone suggests that he is destined for stardom someday. But he missed half the season because of injuries — starting with the preseason foot fracture — and his technique and recognition need a lot of work.

If you look at international fares from five years ago, you're not paying that much more. In 2007, the Travel section's airfare chart showed a flight to Paris for $1,265 in July -- only $20 less than a current fare. Adjusted for inflation, that $1,265 fare would be $1,389 in today's dollars. The one fare that's way out of line is London, which showed up five years ago as $842, or $924 in 2012 dollars. Note that the July 27-Aug. 6 dates correspond with the Olympics, which are a hot ticket.

What complicated efforts even more was that the open borders in the EU allow banks to operate freely across the bloc, but when lenders ran into trouble it was national governments — and taxpayers — who had to foot the bill.

But then Fry is better at pointing out the contradictions in his character than anyone else. Chief among these is the discrepancy between his unflappable public-school English manner and his jangling sense of himself as a "Jewish mongrel with an addictive self-destructive streak." A gay man who infamously outed himself as a celibate during his long sexless period, Fry, like Wilde, is a consummate inside-outsider—a societal position unmatched for comic surveillance.
Not everyone agreed. Republicans portrayed the bill as a burden on small banks and the businesses that rely on them and argued that it will cost consumers and actually impede job growth.

When the Maryland Senate came into session this morning, Sen. Ulysses Currie was seated in the front row — but a crucial 10 feet to the right of his former perch, the desk he was for years afforded as chairman of the Budget and Taxation Committee. Even as senators and delegates shook hands, hugged and greeted each other after an absence of nine months, Senator Currie served as a highly visible, awkward reminder of what could prove to be one of the most difficult pieces of business the legislature will have to take up this year.
Up on the 4th and 5th floors today, Chief Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Fennelly was showing off a modern for wiretapping, and an evidence room, home to an old Aaron Safe Co. vault and shelving surrounded by a storm fence and monitored by video cameras.

A: Being in an environment like Cataract Canyon or the wide, open landscapes in Wyoming help us fall back in love with life. Being in nature gives you an overwhelming sense of humbleness, but you also realize how deeply connected you are to everything. I had a single mother on a river trip many years ago, and after the trip, she had the courage, for the first time, to tell her son about his father, and worked to get them together.
Bushmeyer initially contended that occupancy levels have no effect on the structure's value - because AT&T leases the entire 1.2 million-square-foot building, regardless of the space filled. But Bushmeyer ultimately bought the landlord's argument that the relatively short period left on the lease, along with potential renovations needed to accommodate multiple tenants, justified the lower assessment.
What's not: People are accustomed to using the comparison charts on SeatGuru.com, but I couldn't find the website on the app. You must access it with your smartphone's browser to get the information.

Most disappointing place: Irvine, Scotland. Driving north into the Scottish Highlands, I took a detour to visit Irvine, Scotland. I was curious to see what the place with the same place name as our university town looked like. It was a mistake. There were some pretty old churches and pubs, but a 1970s urban renewal that put a squat mall across the river and a few other concrete-heavy alterations had wrecked whatever charm there once had been.

Our bodies use water for basic functions -- breathing, sweating and urination. We need fluids to regulate overall body temperature, for chemical reactions and nutrition absorption, and more. Water is a lubricant, the basis for saliva and the fluid around joints, mucus membranes, eyes and the spinal cord. It alleviates everyday discomforts, such as constipation. And water helps flush out toxins during the digestive process -- key to preventing acne.
Durbin has seized on the issue of border-crossing fugitives in response to a recent Tribune investigative series that found violent criminals were able to leave the country and remain at large because of an astonishing lack of coordination among U.S. Justice Department officials, county prosecutors and local police; a failure by these agencies to keep track of their cases; and inexplicable, years-long delays.

Quinn also proposes making school districts, community colleges and universities pay a small part of the cost of their employees' pensions. Most pay nothing now. The Republican leadership rejects this, saying it would force school districts to raise property taxes. We don't buy that, given the small amount districts would be asked to pay. But Quinn is wise to separate this issue from his larger plan.
“It was just a great job by our guys, hanging in there, not getting down or frustrated, and always believing that we’re able to score two touchdowns at the end there. That’s what we expected to do, and that’s what we did.”
After Randy Foye's missed three-pointer early in the first quarter, Griffin jumped over Gasol's back on a tip-back dunk. Later, Gasol blocked Griffin's six-foot jumper as the Lakers held a 98-96 lead with 6:15 remaining. Gasol's 12 points on five-of-nine shooting pales to the production of Bynum (35 points) and Bryant (31). But Gasol's two assists to Bynum and a tip-in off Ramon Sessions' missed floater late in the fourth quarter helped keep the Lakers' lead intact. Griffin's 15-point performance featured the two aforementioned highlight reel dunks, but Gasol held him to seven-of-16 shooting.

Districts also saw record levels of voter turnout last year, Belluscio said, with turnout doubling compared to the prior year. Many attributed this increase and the record budget defeats to Gov.

Chunn said the car certainly does have a mind of her own, but age is creeping up on the old girl and she will be replaced in six weeks or so when the team's new car is ready. Ziva's chassis is loose because of several weakened weld spots, Chunn said, and is still fast but can't stay in the corners long enough to hold off the better drivers such as Scott.

Prosecutors hammered away at the lies Anthony told when the child was missing: She told her parents that she couldn't produce Caylee because the girl was with a nanny named Zanny -- a woman who doesn't exist; that she and her daughter were spending time with a rich boyfriend who doesn't exist; and that Zanny had been hospitalized after an out-of-town traffic crash and that they were spending time with her.

By 1984, soft drink companies in the United States had replaced sugar with HFCS in their drinks and the cheaper cost eventually allowed them to sell far bigger bottles at fractionally higher cost to the customer. This led to a huge increase in overall soda consumption: rising more than 60 percent from 1977 to 1997 and doubling in children over that same period.
Some of the key efforts are:
Roshaun "Kevin" Nakia Porter, 36, indicted by a federal grand jury last week and arraigned Monday, faces a potential life sentence when he goes on trial June 19 in Los Angeles.

The beauty of HbA1C lies in its ability to tell you how well or badly controlled your blood sugar was in the previous two to three months. It indicates the average value of your sugar in that period. The advantage of this is a clearer picture of whether medicine, diet and activity are keeping your sugar in a safe range. A single measurement of sugar can be misleading. It provides information on only a very short time span. It doesn't provide the big picture that HbA1C does.

McMurray's strength is racing on restrictor-plate tracks such as Daytona and Talladega Superspeedway. But just because he's a onetime Daytona champion doesn't mean he has an advantage over someone such as defending Sprint Cup champion Tony Stewart, who never has won the Daytona 500.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service spells it out further in an article of shelf-stable food safety found on its website, fsis.usda.gov: "Cans that are heavily rusted can have tiny holes in them, allowing bacteria to enter. Surface rust that you can remove by rubbing with your finger or a paper towel is not serious. You can keep these canned foods. If you open the cans and there is any rust inside, do not eat the food. Rust (oxidized iron) is not safe to eat."

At Riva in Santa Monica, Fraiche's Jason Travi is zeroing in on the pizza front, too, taking his inspiration from the Italian Riviera. The crust has had some glitches, mostly in consistency, but he's been working on it. You can see the wood-burning oven just inside the open kitchen -- not a beauty, but functional. He's got a winner with his Molto Maiale pizza, which is very much in the Molto Mario (Batali) style: More has got to be better. This one is topped with meatballs, sausage, pancetta and bacon. There's a simple potato, Fontina and sea salt pie and a Margherita made with bufala mozzarella. Mushroom, though, seems more like duxelles spread thinly over the crust: not a success. He may be trying too hard to be original.
One of the most amazing traits of the amazing Rivera is his durability in a job that tends to eat its young both physically and mentally. Since last appearing on the DL, Rivera had appeared in 595 games and registered 360 saves (with a 1.89 ERA in that span). If you want a feel how long a stretch 595 games without the DL is, it represents roughly the entire career of Brad Lidge, who appeared in his 593rd game on Opening Day as Storen’s replacement and recorded his 224th career save.
Illinois' Class of 2011 posted the highest average ACT score in a decade — 20.9 — but the performance fell below the national average and most graduates left high school unprepared for key college classes, data released Wednesday show.

Samson said the pay posted online will include base salaries, overtime, longevity payments, unused sick or vacation days, and all other payments to full and part-time employees.
Romney is a good candidate and a good guy. The sooner Republicans get around to that reality, the better it will be for their chances in the 2012 elections. He may not be as conservative as some die-hards would prefer, but he is knowledgeable and can speak about domestic issues and foreign policy concerns in a way many of his challengers do not. As a governor, he helped enact a state health care law that Obamacare was in part modeled after. That can be a negative among some conservatives, but his moderate style and unwillingness to bury his head in the health-care sand while people suffered a broken system is admirable. And it gives Romney a better chance with the general populace.
The experience of watching her valet die painfully had a profound effect on her.

Cleveland is the only municipal-run school district in Ohio, which means the system is controlled by the mayor and not solely by a locally elected school board as is the case with Ohio's other 600-plus public districts. The Cleveland Municipal School District also has been one of the state's lowest academically performing districts, which prompted the mayoral takeover years ago and is the basis for Jackson's urgency to address the problem.

With Bannan aboard, the Broncos possess enough defensive tackles to make it through a game, with Mitch Unrein seeing spot duty and defensive end Robert Ayers rotating inside on pass-rush downs when linebacker Von Miller moves to defensive end. The position isn't settled by any means, but it allows the Broncos draft-day flexibility to pick the best player available, not necessarily a defensive tackle if a coveted prospect drops.

It was smooth, but lacked punch, according to the judges. Carrie Ann loved it, calling it "funky and weird." Len like the "humor" of it, but said it needed "more aggression."

David Blair signs on as Titanic's Second Officer in Belfast. His post was short-lived, however. When the ship reached Southampton, it was decided – perhaps at Captain Smith's urging – that Henry Wilde should join the new ship as her Chief Officer, a post he had most recently served under Smith on the Olympic. As a result, William Murdoch was demoted to First Officer, and Charles Lightoller to Second Officer. Blair was bumped from the roster and departed Titanic on April 9, the day before departure.

Since the kickoff of summer, I have thought to myself, "Ugh… I need a tan." I also began thinking how much easier life would be hundreds of years ago in Europe when being incredibly pale was the "in" thing.

"Deprivation is for me," Philip Larkin once observed, "what daffodils were for Wordsworth." He was right, of course: Unhappiness, loss, disappointment, boredom and fear of death are the bread and butter of his verse. Larkin was the Eeyore of poets, the Debbie Downer of modern literature. The familiar T-shirt -- "Life's a Bitch and Then You Die" -- pretty much sums up the central theme of his work.
Obama's challenge is not so much winning these voters; he won among 18- to 29-year-olds in 2008 by a 34-point margin, and most polls predict he will win the group again easily this year. Rather, it is to draw out as many of them as possible on Election Day.
The Weiskopf familyWanda Weiskopf, an opera singer and wife of a former director of Portland Opera, died April 13, 2012. Wanda Weiskopf, a singer and voice teacher for many years in Portland, died April 13.

Even in 3-D and with the help of quick cuts and maybe a stunt double or two, this is one of the least believable tiny-actress-takes-down-sneering-bad-guys scenes in recent memory.

Most readers know Natalie Babbitt for her fantasy, "Tuck Everlasting." This story, set in a small town in Ohio in the 1960s, has no magic. Joe Casimir, ready for junior high, has always lived with his grandmother, but he's packed off to Aunt Myra while Gran recovers from hip replacement. Though the setting is carefully dated (no Internet, no cellphones), the realities of Joe's life -- the way he doesn't talk about his dreams for life, the excitement of finding new friends (including Beatrice and her dog, Rover) -- speak directly to children today. The moon, changing but in a dependable way, presides over Midville. Not even the richest man in town can buy that. Good for family talk.

David Mamet's "The Secret Knowledge: On the Dismantling of American Culture" comes with a built-in get-out-of-jail-free card: Dispute it and you're part of the problem, a defender of the liberal orthodoxy. Such is the case, I suppose, with any polemic, but here the author is especially adamant. "The struggle of the Left to rationalize its positions is an intolerable, Sisyphean burden. I speak as a reformed Liberal," he declares in a statement deemed significant, or inflammatory, enough to reproduce across the bottom of the book's cover.

When the InterContinental Hotel brand took over the 18th-century mansion Porto Palacio das Cardosas, preserving the landmark's baroque façade, it punctuated the city center's rise. With a flourish.

A. Manhattan. This is a writer's cliche, but it's my favorite place to go. New Yorkers are supposed to be rude, but nowhere in the world am I treated as well as when I'm in New York. New Yorkers really value writers. And it's one of those cities where as soon as you arrive, you can feel the molecules in the air changing. Its energy is completely its own. Last time I was there, I loved going to Ma Peche (http://www.momofuku.com/restaurants/ma-peche/) for dinner. Their noodles were insanely good, followed by a great, sugar-rich dessert at the Momofuku Milk Bar (http://www.momofuku.com/restaurants/milk-bar/). I'm also a big fan of Ippudo (http://www.ippudony.com/) in the East Village, which really does have the best ramen ever. When I'm on vacation, I like to walk a lot and be surrounded by city energy. Nothing beats Manhattan for sheer kinetic excitement -- the yellow cabs, the high rises, the fast-walking people.
