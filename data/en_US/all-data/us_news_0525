He’s a toy-car maker, a toy-car collector — he’s just crazy about cars, period. As a kid, he would ride his bicycle around the track at Dover Speedway, pretending he was a stock car racer. At age 16, he bought a 1937 Ford coupe for $28 at a Boonton junkyard and restored it over the years. Today, Wagner still owns it — and the car is breathtakingly beautiful.
The word "innovation" gets tossed around a lot in the cruise business, as some of the world's best vacation building design and environmental improvements are found on new ships -- from indoor/outdoor activity rooms to amazingly clean waste-water management systems to picture windows that form the outside wall of a cabin.
Sutton said he stood by the outcome of his tenure. "I don't apologize for winning elections. I don't apologize for winning the House and Senate," he said.
He was billed as the greatest high school player in the country and potentially the greatest quarterback ever to come to OSU, a school notably short in great quarterbacks. With a season under his belt, Pryor brings an appetite to learn that is at odds with any insinuation that he is a prima donna, and an unslaked thirst for revenge that is in keeping with his reputation as a fierce competitor.
Kraft worked with a panel of consumer taste experts from around the world to identify the characteristics of the Oreo -- including color, crunchiness, bitterness, color -- that were likely to appeal to Chinese tastes. Executives learned through research that the Chinese don't like their treats as big or as sweet as Americans do. So the company rejiggered the recipe to create a cookie that was a tad smaller and a touch less sweet.

But Peter DiDomenica, who helped create SPOT while working for the Massachusetts State Police, says that behavior screening works. A study by the Department of Homeland Security found that it was nine times more effective than random screening at discovering high-risk travelers.

As the season went on, Sim's progress could be measured in the buildup of crowd energy - a mass inhale as he went up for a three-point shot. Fans expected three points and expected to cheer. In previous years, there was no great anticipation when an Oregon player went up for a shot, unless Tajuan Porter happened to have a hot hand.

Whatever the elements that impel a person to jump off the bridge, it's important to remember that every suicide is marked by irrationality. "Suicide is a closed world, with its own irresistible logic," wrote critic and novelist A. Alvarez in "The Savage God," a response to the suicide of a friend, poet Sylvia Plath. "Everything makes sense and follows its own strict rules; yet, at the same time, everything is also different, perverted, upside down."

But it is rarely clear whether Perry is celebrating youthful femininity or mocking it. Sometimes she seemed to revel in the trappings of suburban cupcake Americana, and sometimes she kicked hard at the gingerbread walls of the dollhouse she’d constructed. Surely this reflects the mixed emotions of millions of teenagers, torn between the comforts of childhood and the excitement of grown-up self-definition. But Perry could not, or would not, treat the subject with any gravity whatsoever. Instead, she came across as something of a comedienne who has lucked into a record contract (indeed, the show did have the feel of a big-budget Hollywood comedy that ran on longer than it should have), joking her way through a two-hour concert that careened wildly between sugar rushes and sugar crashes. And like a cupcake, it left a craving for something more substantial.

Since 2004, more than 30 percent of loans originated or underwritten by Citi Mortgage have gone into default. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development said Citi Mortgage's default rate soared to over 47 percent on loans that were originated in 2006 and 2007, resulting in foreclosures, evictions, and ultimately depressed real estate values, all to the detriment of the national housing market and the national economy.

After Rzep gave up the double to Napoli, imagine La Russa's shock when he signaled for a pitching change two batters later, only to see Lynn walking in to pitch to leadoff man Ian Kinsler. By this time La Russa must have thought he'd used up all of his minutes on his phone plan.
He still weighs about 320, but he’s taller – almost 6-4 – and his weight is more evenly placed. Yes, he could still stand to lose another 20 or 30 pounds, but maybe the best thing for Bembery is that his confidence is back.

A 10-day investigation by Ohio State resulted in the self-imposed five-game penalties and the players repaying the money they gained to charity.

And when supporters of alternative medicine say that “one century’s folk medicine can be the next century’s mainstream medicine,” they have a point, Offit adds. More than 2,000 years before aspirin was isolated from willow plants, none other than Hippocrates was using the leaves to alleviate aches and pains. There are similar stories for drugs to treat heart failure, malaria and other ailments. “Indeed, most drugs on today’s hospital formularies were originally derived from plants,” Offit writes.

I want to understand why as Jews we do certain things and be able to perpetuate that within my family.

To some extent, the weight epidemic has been politicized by the debate over national health care, which continues to play a big role in the current presidential race. While first lady and White House gardener Michelle Obama makes an appearance in "The Weight of the Nation," the issues at stake are far bigger than politics. Politicians on one side of the aisle may be more in favor of national health care than others, while other politicians are beholden, if not under the thumb, of the food industry.
Cain is refusing to discuss the issue. But if he thinks he can become president without answering these charges, he is more nuts than he seems.

I’ve taken the Aquapac into the ocean, to water parks and to our town pool, and it’s not because I want to make phone calls.

The plan backfired as Gordon delivered a two-run double to right. Maybe earlier in the game, Gordon's hit might have been just a single.

Vito Stellino tells some of the best Al Davis stories. Stellino was a Pittsburgh Steelers beat writer in the late 1970s when their rivalry with the Raiders was the fiercest in all of sports.

I wish there were a handy nomenclature to describe the style of cooking Fenouil is turning out. "Modern," "refined" and "worked" are close but don't quite do it.

Transformational cooking simply cuts, prepares and arranges things on your plate in new and pictorial arrangements that keep intact the pun on palate and palette.

While the artfully presented film is approximately as cinematic as the layouts in a tony shelter magazine, what's worth watching is Riseborough's performance, compelling even when the film pooh-poohs the generally accepted knowledge that the Duke and Duchess of Windsor were Nazi sympathizers.

City documents from the 2001 meeting don't explicitly state that Edina Car Wash is an accessory car wash, but implies it when stating accessory car washes' parking requirements.

Before I take your questions, I just happened to notice in my in-box a wire story about impressive sales results for all the major American automobile companies. And it just brings a smile to my face because, as you recall, the President took very bold action, very difficult political environment, to ensure that the American automobile industry would survive and thrive.

Woods didn't birdie any of the par 5s -- only the third time that has happened in 68 rounds at the Masters. He tried a wild hook around the trees on the par-5 13th and paid for a risky shot. The ball plugged in a steep bank, and he had no choice but to take his third penalty shot of the tournament. Then, from the middle of the 15th fairway, his 4-iron sailed into the gallery, leading to another burst of swearing and another par.

The gravy was popular by the 1930s, writes John Mariani in "The Dictionary of American Food and Drink" (Hearst Books, 1994 edition). He reports that the gravy "takes its name from the appearance of a 'red eye' in the middle of the reduced gravy." Among its other names: red ham gravy and frog-eye gravy.
Perhaps the movie's most surprising feat? Somehow, the darned thing mostly works, probably because its heart is in the right place. Inspired by the true story of the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of African-American pilots who battled both the Nazis and racism, the film's sincerity and good intentions shine through the hokum.

When she brought us the fries, the bartender told us the chef had a last-minute supplier meeting that would last half an hour. He was alone in the kitchen, so we took our time with our drinks, waiting until he returned to order entrees.

Another concern raised by the Maryland Energy Administration seems a bit less academic than it once did: the new company's exposure to risk from the nuclear power industry.

I wondered how it would all play out in Colorado Springs. Many people who don't live here consider our town a benighted backwater of far-right ideology, but it's not that simple. An older woman I know who has an "Impeach Obama" bumper sticker pasted on her front door dog-sits for her black neighbors. Here, Fannie May Duncan opened her Cotton Club, with an "Everybody Welcome" sign on the front door. Are we a prejudice-free city? Of course not; the affluent intersection of Briargate and Lexington, in the northeast part of town, and the crime-ridden junction of Fountain and Circle, in the south central part, are light-years apart, and anyone who doesn't recognize the importance of color in that difference isn't paying attention.

The Lakers are still a better team with him. They're more equipped to generate easy baskets. The Lakers can finally run pick-and-roll sets. And Bryant doesn't have to handle the ball as much.

The party break over the contentious issue could reverberate in an election year, with implications not only for Obama in battleground states with significant numbers of Catholic working-class voters such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, but also for Democrats in congressional races.

He didnt have the big numbers and, keep in mind, Denard Robinsons not going to be a quarterback in the NFL; hes going to be probably a receiver or a return man. So hes not a passer, Kiper said. Thats what hurts Junior Hemingway. Hemingways a very underrated receiver out of Michigan whos going to be a good fourth- or fifth-round pick for somebody and probably would have gone higher if he had a little more productivity ... at Michigan.

The road to statehood was long and agonizing. No other territory waited as long or fought as stubbornly as the pioneers of the Arizona Territory. Looking back, their determination was unquenchable. Just 28 years after becoming a territory, the residents decided the time was ripe for statehood. In 1891, they wrote a constitution and took the train to Washington to hand-deliver it to Congress.

I will. I was interviewed by Stein in my office, am featured in his film "Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed," saw a screening of it last month at the National Religious Broadcasters' convention (tellingly, a film allegedly about science education is being marketed to religious groups), and have written a thorough critique of it at skeptic.com and sciam.com (see also expelledexposed.com). Here I know of what I speak, and as such I can assure you of two things: First, the film is wrong in virtually every one of its factual claims about evolution and the alleged persecutions of those who challenge the theory, and second, viewers will be hoodwinked into believing all the lies for the same reason they were taken in by Michael Moore's films -- the power of filmic propaganda to trump facts and reason.

The talking-points defense for what Kasich did is that a consumers' counsel call center (for ratepayer questions and complaints) duplicated a PUCO call center. Yet the agencies have distinctly different missions. The commission is something like a court; the consumers' counsel is a lawyer for ratepayers. Funny thing: Corporate Ohio forever bleats that all it wants is a "level playing field" in Columbus -- until it actually gets one. Corporate Ohio has $500-an-hour lawyers and purring lobbyists at the Statehouse. Utility ratepayers have the consumers' counsel -- just not as much as they did.

Those are valid points, but they come wrapped in hypocrisy. Last year, as a shortage of judges was creating backlogs in courtrooms across the state, one of the writers of the column, Sen. Gerald Cardinale, R-Demarest, a notorious practitioner of senatorial courtesy, admitted that he was blocking Senate consideration of five judicial nominations by then-Gov.

On some fronts, our vigilance and resolve clearly have succeeded. Right after 9/11, many Americans assumed that a second attack was inevitable, but it has never come and numerous attempts have been thwarted. This spring, after a decade of searching and frustration, a team of Navy SEALs tracked down and killed Osama bin Laden, the mastermind of 9/11. Even before bin Laden's death, his al-Qaida band of murderers was on the run, thanks not just to the relentless efforts of American military and intelligence personnel, but also the cooperation of their counterparts in many countries. Al-Qaida and its emulators have struck London, Madrid, Jakarta and other cities; they seeded sectarian warfare in Iraq after the U.S. invasion; and they continue to breed in chaotic, failed states -- but their brand of militant jihad is clearly in retreat, and the Arab Spring stands as evidence that millions who hunger for change in the Middle East have rejected the siren song of terrorism.

But artists have to earn a living too, and this was Rivera's first job in the U.S. He devised a 30-foot-high design for an allegory of California and used tennis star Helen Wills Moody as the model for the woman whose face would symbolize the state's beauty and promise. He also included the oil wells, the ag workers and a couple of boys playing with a toy airplane. Not a hint of skepticism.

A: The only avocados that have seen any success in the lower deserts are the varieties from Mexico -- the Mexicola and Stewart. These are grown in California's Imperial Valley with some success. Our issue is the summer heat, as these two varieties are cold-tolerant to 20 degrees. A seed that you have acquired from the store is probably a Guatemalan variety, which will not tolerate our climate. Avocados need afternoon sun protection in the summer and do well only in microclimates. I believe if you can provide the right spot, it is worth experimenting.
I chalk some of that up to our lineup not including some notable producers - Venica, Zidarich, Radikon and Miani among them - whose names are worth looking for, as is almost any wine from the Carso, that dangling participle of Italy draped atop the Adriatic (see sfg.ly/idSRT3).

But instead of implanting this embryo into a uterus and producing a baby that’s a genetic copy of another person, you would use it to make a line of human embryonic stem cells. Then you can use those stem cells to make replacement parts – new cardiac cells for patients who suffered heart attacks, for instance, or nerve cells that would replace those lost after a spinal cord injury. In theory, the new cells would work perfectly because they’d be a perfect genetic match. This is the vision of regenerative medicine.
But both say they are independent-minded, fiscal conservatives who would bring fresh ideas to cut taxes in this debt-ridden municipality.
About the only saving grace — if there is one at all — in this tawdry version of a bedroom farce is that Edwards failed in his multiple attempts to reach the White House either as a candidate for the top job or as Sen. John Kerry’s running mate in 2004. How lucky we should consider ourselves.

Too many kitchen changes, though, have finally taken a toll. From founder Jean-Marie Lacroix to Matt Levin to Jason Cichonski and now chef Jon Cichon, the brilliant concept of this gastro-brunch remains intact. From the raw bar to the creative hors d'oeuvres (Black garlic shoofly pie!) and twists on carving-station classics (Negroni-glazed salmon; Wagyu brisket), there are still many delights. But there were also startling misfires: soggy "chicken-and-waffle" panzanella; a gray blob of rye bread-lobster pudding that shouldn't have seen the light of a $59 brunch.
