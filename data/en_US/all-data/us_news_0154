Let's see. For the 13th time in 14 seasons, the Browns open the season at home. This one is against a 8-8 team that Pat Shurmur and Brad Childress ought to know better than most. Not that there's much proof of it locally, but opening at home is considered an advantage throughout the NFL for a reason that's pretty obvious. It beats the alternative.

A: It was my situation as a starter. Obviously, they had demoted me, so talking about a new contract at that point in time would have been kind of crazy. (Laughs) That was basically I wanted an opportunity to show everybody and to show them especially I was who I said I was. If I was going to be playing 40, 50 percent of the plays and rotating, I wasn’t going to have a chance to put up the numbers I felt were necessary to achieve my goals. That’s what that conversation was about. I wanted to play, I wanted to be a starter and that’s how it went.

The council has struggled for more than a year without an administrator because there is not enough money to hire one.

Bad information? No. As I replied to Matusow, she was evidently being sold another card. The day after I mentioned United's Explorer card, United and Chase introduced a new higher-end Visa card called MileagePlus Club. That one costs $395 a year, with $95 credited for the first year. It has the same benefits as the Explorer card, but also offers many extras, including a year of full membership to United Club airport lounges.

The shameful way that SB 5 passed is a symptom of a deeper problem that eats at the core of Ohio's politics.

Alma Chocolate: Sarah Hart and her crew are always tinkering with crave-worthy chocolate flavors and pitch-perfect baked goods, a sure sign of creative minds at work. The hot chocolate menu is no exception, with no fewer than 10 variations on hand, none made with syrups, so flavors are true and balanced instead of tooth-achingly sweet. Try the orange hot chocolate, fashioned from a melted chocolate bar embedded with tiny bits of dried orange peel; or the ear-warming Carmelita ($3.50), a not-too-sweet drink spiked with Alma's own habanero caramel sauce and hand-shaken cream. The Bicerin ($3.75) -- Alma's rich drinking chocolate plus a shot of local Spella Caffé espresso -- tastes like liquefied chocolate-covered espresso beans.

Yet irrespective of the Tea Party, the new House Republican majority is unlikely to give in on certain Democratic initiatives, particularly on so-called cap and trade -- a proposed program for curtailing carbon emissions by reducing coal use.

Lance Lynn could become a classic No. 5 starter, winning 10 to 12 games if he can regain his ability to eat innings. Although he had some shutdown games in the minor leagues, generally he was just an above-average starter that kept his team in games. He will try to become Jake Westbrook as the slimmed down Westbrook tries to become something better this season. With Chris Carpenter gone for much of the season, both Westbrook and Kyle Lohse will need to fare better than a year ago. If they do, that should keep Lynn from feeling the burden of replacing the staff ace.

Much of the analysis and politics surrounding Obamacare pertain to one overarching issue: the power of the federal government to regulate private economic behavior through the Commerce Clause. Progressives see a generally limitless connection, while conservatives advance the notion that private health insurance (particularly the decision to forgo such insurance) is a personal decision outside the reach of the federal government. In other words, the mere power of the federal government to regulate commerce among the states does not extend to forcing every American into the commercial insurance market. A possible complication for the GOP: Justice Antonin Scalia, a member of the Court's so-called "conservative majority," has (at times) adopted a more expansive view of Commerce Clause jurisdiction. Nevertheless, I (and many other observers) believe it more likely than not that the Court will strike down the mandate. The Court could strike all or only portions of the statute. A divided Congress would then attempt to figure out what to do next.

The former, which reopened earlier this year after an extended hiatus, is open weekend evenings, where traditional live Greek music is featured. The latter is a small tiki bar known for serving kava, hookahs, and yes, a 100-ounce margarita. The drinks here are wine-based, but don't be fooled — they're potent. Expect to get roped into doing some karaoke if you stop by; just please don't butcher Whiskey in the Jar as badly as I did.

In any event, sure I can't make any promises that things will go smoothly and comfortably for anyone. I do know that they very often do. Personally, I never found childbirth myself particularly magical or transcendent - another Hollywood depiction - but I did think it was really cool. Any pain was manageable. And, of course, it's really fun when it's over and you've got this weird-looking little thing they put in your arms. Moreover, most of my contemporaries had very similar experiences.

But Edwards' 2008 strategy carries risks, in part because it speaks most directly to a slice of the electorate that has notably little political clout. Perhaps the last major presidential candidate to make fighting poverty a central theme was Sen. Robert F. Kennedy (D-N.Y.) in 1968, before his assassination that June. Some analysts warn that an agenda that might suggest "class warfare" risks alienating middle-class swing voters and moderate Democrats who do not want to revive criticisms that theirs is the party of the poor.

Having said all that, I think he'll have a monster year. Albert's iron will has always been his most powerful asset. He's going to be determined to prove that the Angels made a smart move and the Cardinals made a mistake. Frank Robinson had the best year of his career after switching leagues in 1966, winning the MVP for Baltimore. I won't be surprised if Albert does the same thing for the Angels in 2012.

The NHL's takeaway/giveaway stats are notoriously subjective and at the whim of home arena statisticians. But over the last few years, Thornton has become a notorious thief in the neutral and defensive zones. He led the NHL in takeaways during the 2010-11 season. He's become particularly adept at the trackback move of pilfering pucks from behind an opponent rushing up the ice.

Comparisons will inevitably be made between "Duplicity" and Steven Soderbergh's remake of the tacky Rat Pack caper.

Maybe so, but Tess was terrific in her way. So was the cheerful, uncluttered script that had George Clooney's Danny asking her if her new husband made her laugh, and Tess responding, ever so succinctly, "He doesn't make me cry."

Today’s game will be one where the Beavers will be playing themselves as must as the Utes. On its other two road trips, not counting the day trip to Eugene, Oregon State has lost on Thursday and again on Saturday. If it happens again, the Beavers would be in trouble.

MS. MILLS: Absolutely. That's something that we do quite a bit of in bank lending and in SBA lending. So those are some of the avenues that we can talk about in order to make sure there's more working capital. I hear all the time that working capital for growth is as hard to get as any other kind of capital. And we're doing a very good job right now on real estate lending and on equipment capital, and we're working hard on working capital as well.
Even worse, the building itself is covered in soot. It looks cheap and dingy. How much could it cost to pressure-wash the building so it could look respectable?

But it's Hazanvicius who ultimately is responsible for the film, of course, having created it and brought all the elements together, masterfully so.

The story is far from over. Will the Fair Commission's follow-up actions adequately address the deficiencies noted in the consultants' reports?

However, Nelson found that those broad strokes also keep Burns "from offering the kind of incisive social analysis the story so desperately needs. Burns's acknowledgments indicate that she interviewed everyone from Ed Koch to Barry Scheck of the Innocence Project to Matias Reyes to the families of the five. Yet she often erases specific speakers and sources, opting instead for washes of impersonal, sometimes platitudinous generalizations, many of which rely on grammatical obfuscations to soften insights that could have been razor sharp."
Ruckman and Webster perfectly capture the surface propriety and hidden tensions that come into play whenever Kelly and Emily interact. As the baby Eva project drags on, Kelly grows frantic over her perceived inability to finish the doll.

The crushing August heat hung heavily over all of Rome, so a priest friend suggested a visit to the catacombs. It became a much greater adventure than we had expected.
There was no indication that insurgents knew that many aboard the doomed Chinook belonged to Team Six. But the Taliban and their allies are likely to reap an enormous propaganda boost from the deaths. The Taliban often seek to appeal to the country's folkloric sensibilities by depicting battlefield exploits in florid fashion; videos and songs trumpet various successes against foreign "invaders," and any victory against NATO forces is held up as proof of divine inspiration and guidance.
The Nostalgic Istanbul Orient Express isn't the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, the ultradeluxe train that runs between Paris and Venice. But neither are we paying the $2,000 a night that train costs (our trip runs about $500 per night). We climb aboard to find our compartments -- beautiful art nouveau relics of a bygone era. My cabin, No.32 in car 6, has a single bed, a wash basin and a small table by the window. But like many antiques, not everything works like new. Some of the rugs are frayed, the woodwork nicked. The hinge on my medicine cabinet falls off and the bulb won't stay in the reading lamp.
"That was a rough start we didn't expect," said Cleveland coach Steve Thonn. "You can't go scoreless in the first quarter."
"I say this, albeit, with a very heavy and saddened heart," Ali said. "These kinds of data are illustrative of the disturbing and alarming trend we are seeing across this country."
Roy said he took only five shots because he was "trying to see where I can fit in out there," and at least two of those shots were point-blank layups that he missed. He also missed both of his free-throw attempts.
One of those decisions granted gay couples the same rights as heterosexuals, paving the way for civil unions in New Jersey.
Before returning to the mainland, I took a quick spin down Flagler Avenue for a look at the ocean next to The Breakers restaurant. A renovation project has transformed the iconic boardwalk into a construction site surrounded by chain-link fence. The work began in November, timed to avoid interfering with the sea-turtle nesting season. It's scheduled to be done by May and the new area will feature improved restrooms (much needed) and improvements to the boardwalk and its pergola.
You are not surprised that he has fanatical friends, guys like Dog Man, who communicates in Bruce Springsteen lyrics. Or Bonfatti, a Red Sox fan (Seely spells it Socks throughout) who threw a victory party for the Boston-Mets game that included the ball dribbling through Bill Buckner’s legs. Ignored the Juju rule that you never host a victory party for an upcoming game because you wind up with a defeat, a lousy party and a splintered coffee table.
"You know, they say miracles happen. But you have to be prepared for both," Brandon told him. "You're going to miss out if you get up every day with that fake hope. The here and now is, your legs don't work. Once you get past the physical stuff, it's all between your ears."
"With the cost of remodeling down and the interest rates as low as they've ever, ever been, this is the absolute best time to do anything," said Dave Dunlap, owner of Consolidated Design & Construction in Maplewood. "But if folks are worried about their jobs, it's not going to happen."

The push for mergers and acquisitions is a good sign for investors, said Uri Landesman, the president of Platinum Partners, a hedge fund in New York City.

Jordan Theodore (17 pts., 5 reb., 2 ast.): Regardless of whether or not this was his sendoff on the (truly) big stage, the Pirates captain went out in style. He captivated the Garden crowd in rallying the Pirates from 15 down with just over 10 minutes to go. Then all those hard takes to the basket. Just an all-around gutsy effort.

Given the prospects of higher interest rates with the massive government spending, tying up your money for an additional three years for less than a 1 percentage point increase could be unwise. If you must stick with CDs so you can sleep at night, you may want to buy shorter-term CDs in anticipation that when they mature in the near future, you can convert them to longer-term CDS -- with notably higher rates.

Ten months ago, the restaurant took another abrupt turn when Melissa Perello came on board. The young, up-and-coming chef blazed onto the scene at Charles Nob Hill and is hoping Fifth Floor will be her pathway to the top. Just 28 years old, she has immense talent and she's implemented an ambitious menu that's billed as French but feels very California.

"All the teachers need a fair shake," said parent David Cox of Mission Viejo, who has a daughter at Carl Hankey, explaining that a permanent pay cut for teachers is not fair.
"But the tough thing about LA, besides the traffic, is the homogeneity of the people. Everyone you meet is in the entertainment industry. At my daughter's school parties, all the parents are film industry people passing business cards around. There's cool cultural stuff in Los Angeles, but there are also a lot of really desperate people trying to make it there, so it was nice to shoot a movie somewhere else. I like that summer-camp vibe. In LA, a film crew is just a pain in the neck, but in places like New Orleans, the neighbors want to help. Of course, they want to gawk, too."

"We said before the draft the only player we had an interest in moving up to get was Claiborne," Jones said. "We had serious doubts he would get to six. But then the opportunity presented itself and they started taking players in front of him and the price was right for us. To go from 14 to six, you got give up something. By a lot of charts you got to give up more. To a get a difference maker on defense, we pulled the trigger."

Newt Gingrich is endorsing a South Carolina law that allows police to demand a person's immigration status -- a week after taking heat for advocating a "humane" approach. Rick Perry, though defending Texas' in-state tuition for some illegal immigrants' kids, spent Tuesday campaigning with a hardline Arizona sheriff in New Hampshire. And Mitt Romney is talking tough on immigration in his second White House campaign, though he previously supported the idea of allowing some illegal immigrants to stay in the U.S.

The slight concession, offered in a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement, pointed to a possible way out of the diplomatic standoff. Even so, he remained in a guarded Beijing hospital ward, unable to see U.S. officials. His wife's movements are being monitored, he said, and the couple with their two children feel in danger.
Even with a major character and the foundation of its (admittedly flimsy) plot missing, "Pirates" lives pretty well from gag to gag, nearly achieving its Monty Python meets "Treasure Island" potential. There are genius moments here. The pirate ship features coin-op cannons, a surprisingly curvaceous mate with a hilariously transparent fake beard never arouses suspicion, and Joseph Merrick pops in for a brief Elephant Man cameo. There are flat stretches as well (Salma Hayek and Jeremy Piven underwhelm as villainous rival Pirate of the Year contestants). Still, I emitted more "Harrrs" than "Arrghs."

Labels such as “emo” and “screamo” don’t really do justice to Thursday’s potent blend of deeply felt lyrics, sweeping melodies and harsh vocals, although both emotion and screaming do figure heavily in the mix. For this show, with Florida metal giants Underoath, Thursday kept things simple, dressing in black from head to toe and performing on a bare stage against a black backdrop. The starkness helped heighten the theatricality and power of 31-year-old vocalist Geoff Rickly.

Why: The historic Gonzalez Byass house, best known for its Tio Pepe fino, gets far less cred than it deserves. Its amontillado consistently delivers star performances without ever quite finding the spotlight. Amontillado offers more robust flavors than fino, and in this case there's tremendous clarity and freshness to those flavors: driftwood, hazelnut skin, nori, mulled citrus peel and dried fig, with a chalky edge.

It’s a regular stoner performance that needs to be tolerated in very small doses, no matter how important the ensuing laughter gets as an antidote to heavy subject matter which some could choose not to endure.

The criminal justice system, like all human institutions, is imperfect. Where the death penalty is concerned, it isn't a question of whether the state has executed an innocent person.

Does the U.S. want to be judged with such countries as North Korea and Saudi Arabia as countries that impose the death penalty?
