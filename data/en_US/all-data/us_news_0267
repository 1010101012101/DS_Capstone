Jimmy would have given his life if Buddy could have gotten out of that bed. He told me that with a tear in his eye. Chills overcame me as I looked across the table. He said he would do whatever he could to get Buddy to laugh, even if he had to play the clown as a boy — which he did, often. Whenever Buddy said the word “orange,” Jimmy had to stop what he was doing and do exactly what Buddy told him. “Stand on your head,” Buddy would order. And Jimmy would do that. In search of a healing miracle years later, Jimmy would take Buddy to the sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France (see excerpt). Jimmy told me, “I was the arms and legs he no longer had use of.”

And the not-so positives:
But a two-land-war capability is no longer appropriate for the age of austerity. A "1+2" framework for sizing ground combat forces is a better way today. It is prudent because it assumes that ground war is not obsolete however much we might like to think so given national fatigue over the Iraq and Afghanistan missions. It also provides some additional capability if and when the nation again engages in a major conflict, providing a combat cushion should that war go less well than initially hoped. Yet it is also modest, economical and cognizant of today's economic challenges to American power, because it assumes only one such conflict at a time and does not envision major ground wars against the world's major overseas powers on their territories.

Matt Bracken: The transfers of R.J. Dill and Max Garcia were major losses that can't be discounted, but there still appears to be a decent amount of depth on Maryland's offensive line. It remains to be seen whether or not the five guys who ultimately compose that starting line are able to do what it takes to make Edsall's power running game work. Fifth-year senior Justin Gilbert, finally healthy, provides a steadying, veteran presence at right tackle. On the left side, Nick Klemm had the upper-hand over redshirt freshman Ryan Doyle as of a couple weeks ago. At center, redshirt sophomore Sal Conaboy seems to have stepped up and claimed that spot. The guards are a little tougher to figure out, with one-time defensive end De'Onte Arnett and former starters Josh Cary and Bennett Fulper all in the mix. Guys like Jake Wheeler, Evan Mulrooney, Andrew Zeller and Stephen Grommer, meanwhile, are waiting their turn, and Pete White could be a factor once he gets healthy. Offensive line coach Tom Brattan called this group "a work in progress." Finding the right combination of linemen would go a long way toward drastically improving the ACC's 10th-ranked scoring offense.

A 60-page section on sowing and growing tells how to make divisions of spreading perennials and take cuttings of the single-stemmed ones.

You will eat crisp cornmeal empanadas filled with huitlacoche or with squash blossoms, gooey lakes of melted cheese with chorizo or with jalapeno and onion, or possibly undistinguished Yucatan-style salbute.

2007 Bogle Vineyards Pinot Noir, Russian River Valley, California ($12-$14) - The big trend now is making deep, dark-colored Pinots that could very well be blended with Syrah and are yammy-jammy rich. This Bogle is a throwback. Its color is light, and the aroma has a delicate, light cherry tone with a little spice and wild strawberry. The taste is very smooth, with no hard edges. This is a super-easy and quaffable Pinot with appealing fruit character and just enough structure to keep it lively. 87 points

Editor - On my 23rd birthday, June 27, 1969, my friends and I went out dancing at the Stonewall on Christopher Street in New York. The police were having a slow night, so they decided to raid the place. People fought back and there was a riot. The parade commemorates that event on the Sunday closest to June 27 every year, so I always think of it as my birthday parade. A couple of years later, I moved here, and in 1977 I was watching the parade when one group caught my eye. Five guys were carrying posters showing Stalin, Hitler, Idi Amin, the Ku Klux Klan and Anita Bryant. I thought it was a great visual, and the guy carrying the picture of the burning crosses was totally dreamy, so I walked along with them. Apparently, every photographer on the planet thought it was a great image, and pictures of that group appeared in Time, Newsweek and the New York Times. I wish I could claim credit for the group's concept, but I was just hoping to meet the guy with the KKK poster. He never noticed me, but I became part of an iconic moment. I'm the one in the white overalls.

Its accusation in a letter to the board Thursday was a bombshell for the struggling Internet giant. Third Point also accused board member Patti Hart of inflating her academic credentials.
The outcry was confounding. Who had requested that we run the complete letter? And who at the paper had refused? Nobody knew, and as the stream of phone calls and emails increased, editors elected to publish the denial story, along with the full text of the letter.
Six Secret Service employees, including two supervisors, have been forced out of the agency amid the scandal that erupted the morning of April 12 when a fight over payment between a Colombian prostitute and a Secret Service officer spilled into the hallway of the Hotel Caribe. They were part of Obama's advance security team in Cartagena. One officer was cleared of serious wrongdoing but will face administrative action, the agency said Friday. The remaining five officers have been suspended.
And California did see an improvement. Between 1999 and 2008, the violent crime rate here dropped nearly 20 percent, outpacing five of the eight largest states and the US as a whole, which saw a drop of 13 percent. Only two of the large states had a larger drop in violent crime – New York (32 percent) and Illinois (28 percent).
Zitzner and other Breakthrough leaders say they are proud of what they accomplish, especially because their students have backgrounds and challenges similar to those of kids enrolled in the Cleveland school district.

“It’s all definitely a challenge,” Johansson says of the often unwanted attention. “Even if you don’t go out late and hit all the clubs — and I’m a low-key kind of person — they’ll still dig up what they can.

Jubal. Pseudonym for GOP blogger Matt Cunningham, who runs the ocblog/Red County Web site. I wondered: Did he take the name Jubal from the cowboy Glenn Ford played in a 1956 movie - a guy who refuses to carry a gun? Not very Republican. Or for the Civil War general, Jubal Early? Not a great role model. For the Biblical character, a direct descendant of Cain? Another winner. Always has a fun St. Patrick's Day party. Fun fact: Servite High classmate of Democrat Darren Aitken.

The Legg Mason Tennis Classic, a staple of the late-summer sporting scene in the Washington area for more than four decades, is getting a dramatic makeover that will include a new title sponsor, stadium upgrades and shared billing with an existing tournament for rising women's players.
But local officials make frequent exceptions. Out of 781 projects proposed on lakefront land between 2005 and 2010, zoning boards in Cass and Crow Wing counties denied just 91 requests, or 12 percent of the total. On average, that meant homes were built 21 feet closer to the shoreline than rules allowed. Homes also were much bigger than the rules allowed, reducing the amount of vegetation available to filter pollutants flowing into lakes.
The combination of a tepid economy, depressed power markets and costs of meeting tougher environmental regulations have already prompted utilities including Ameren Corp. to shutter older, dirtier and less efficient coal-fired power plants. While the new EPA proposal wouldn't affect plants that are already permitted or are being built now, including the massive Prairie State plant near Lively Grove, Ill., some observers believe it would not be cost-effective for utilities to build new coal-powered plants with today's technology.
U.S. Rep. Tom McClintock (R., Calif.) has for years advocated a flat tax in California to reduce volatility and keep high-earners from leaving the state.

Francisco insisted he was not worried about the disabled list, “not at all,” he said. But his injury may interfere with Alderson’s plan to fix the team’s greatest weakness last season. The bullpen for the 2011 Mets was built on the cheap, with small-scale deals thrown at players like D.J. Carrasco, Jason Isringhausen and Taylor Buchholz. In turn, the relievers floundered their way to a collective 4.33 ERA, which ranked 28th in all of baseball.
But we're still only half way through this innovative chain. The problem with these handheld devices is that they're too small, making what seems like productivity actually just a big waste of other people's time. I loathe people sending me emails from their smartphone because they so clearly a) haven't read what I wrote to them and b) bothered to think about what they're saying back. So, I was right: A lot of computing is being done on our cellphone. Unfortunately it's not being matched by any computing in our heads.

But the Tar Heels' offense sputtered at times, particularly in the second half, when they shot 22.6 percent, a team record for lowest percentage in a half of an NCAA Tournament game. The Tar Heels missed on all 10 shots from 3-point range and scored their last basket with 5 minutes, 46 seconds remaining. Their last point, a free throw by Harrison Barnes, left them trailing 68-67 with 3:58 left.

Chances that the Ravens draft an offensive lineman in first three rounds: Almost guaranteed. The Ravens offensive line is by far the team’s biggest question mark at this point of the offseason. They have yet to replace Pro Bowl left guard Ben Grubbs, who signed with the New Orleans Saints, though they have talked about giving second-year tackle Jah Reid an opportunity to move to guard. Veteran center Matt Birk re-signed, putting off retirement for at least one season. He’s not the long-term answer, nor is Bryant McKinnie at left tackle. While Marshal Yanda and Michael Oher represent a strong right side, the Ravens don’t have any experienced backups at any spot along the offensive line. The Ravens maintain that they draft the best player available rather than selecting by need. But they have addressed their biggest need with their first-round pick more often than not in recent years, and most draft pundits expect them to do it again this year.

There was an iceberg-size irony to the way fans embraced the movie, considering they knew the ending long before sitting down to the 195-minute production. Its monumental popularity came from director James Cameron's approach. He made "Titanic" a love story set against a historical disaster, rather than focusing on the history and making the characters afterthoughts. The film took its place with classic love stories such as "Gone With the Wind" and "Casablanca," other great films that used history as a backdrop for memorable characters.

Initial efforts to lay blame upon the president -- who was betrayed by both the GSA director he had appointed and by the Secret Service and military personnel tasked to protect him in Cartagena -- were predictable enough. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, suggested that Obama is somehow “responsible” for overspending on a GSA conference in Las Vegas simply because he appointed the agency’s head (whom he promptly fired when the abuses came to his attention). She has been in government long enough to know that the president can scarcely oversee every dollar -- and while $860,000 sounds like a lot of money, it is a vanishingly small sum in a nearly $4 trillion federal budget. Grandstanding politicians like her often compare the nation’s expenditures, with false naivete, to a household budget. For a family earning $40,000 a year, this would represent a misallocation of far less than 4 cents.

If the Buckeyes play to their capabilities, they'll win. But after the first half at Wisconsin and the first half against Penn State last week, I have doubts as to whether Ohio State will do that today against a good team in a tough place to play.

It's easy enough to sit still while Mr. Ford, looking weary yet touchingly human, fiddles with binary codes, camera pens and other electronic esoterica. It's downright clever when the movie transcends its countless product placements by having Jack transfer crucial data from the bank's mainframe computer to his iPod: "Ten thousand songs, ten thousand account codes," he says with a shrug and a cockeyed smile. "What's the difference?"

BierBeisl is the first restaurant for the 27-year-old chef. While the menu does have excellent sausages and a classic weinerschnitzel, he's intent on bringing contemporary Austrian cooking to Los Angeles. The cuisine is under-appreciated in this country, probably because it's so little known. And that's a shame. Breads and pastries are outstanding, not to mention the wines, and you eat well at every level from heurigen (wine pub) to traditional and sophisticated modern restaurants.

The second memory is from the match against Montreal Impact in 2009. The family was at the match including my 4-year-old grandson, Ace. The match was heading for a draw but for the whole of the 2nd half Ace kept saying to me "The Timbers are going to score a goal." They did score with 89:59 minutes on the clock and the stadium erupted. Ace got caught up in the celebrations and my memory is of following him out of the stadium, his hands held high, chanting "Timbers! Timbers!" It was the match he stopped being an interested spectator and became a fan.

Totally fine to think of the cocktail that way, but let's put down the ready-made, Day-Glo sour mix, step away from the margarita machine and take the drink seriously for just a moment. The margarita may conjure images of spring break in Cancún and fishbowl glasses with cactuses as stems or yardstick-long containers filled with boozy slush. But the cocktail is so much more than that.

Jaws agape, he creeps to the edge of the pond, a living dinosaur with a walnut-sized brain, hair-trigger instinct and an appetite for flesh. At a major zoo, perhaps Goliath would be sedated in advance of his teeth cleaning appointment.

The dreariest thing about Disney animated movies is how they always depend on the hero or heroine overcoming adversity by drawing on inner reserves of strength. There's nothing wrong with that, of course, but it does tend to force all its film narratives into a self-help straitjacket. And it renders Disney with nothing interesting to say about religion, despite strong religious themes in the story.
''We thought it might be fun to borrow/pay homage to/steal an idea from 'High Fidelity' and have him go on a romantic pilgrimage and visit the girls that he dated and try to figure out how the hell he screwed things up with each of them ...

Alley-oop continues to be a weapon: The Blazers led the NBA with 156 alley-oop lobs during the regular season as Miller recorded the most alley-oop assists (74) and LaMarcus Aldridge racked up the most alley-oop finishes (102). It continued to be a successful play Saturday night.
According to the National Institute of Mental Health, half of all cases of mental illness start by age 14, and about 11% of adolescents have a depressive disorder by age 18. Left untreated, such issues can lead to high dropout rates, substance abuse, violence—and suicide, the third-leading cause of death in adolescents. In a study of 2,500 students who went through the Fond du Lac program at six public high schools between 2005 and 2009, published last week in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, nearly 20% were identified as at risk, of whom 73.6% were not receiving treatment at the time of screening. Among that group, more than three-quarters completed at least one visit with a mental-health provider within 90 days after referral to school and community services.

But if you had the chance to spend a lot of time around George Steinbrenner, as I did while covering the Yankees — and the Steinbrenner beat — for The Star-Ledger from 1976 through 1992, you learned there was so much more to him, that the caricature revealed only part of this astoundingly complex character.

This notion gained in popularity after World War II, when the suburbs exploded and the commute to downtown was worse than anything we complain of today. The Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, largely crafted by MacDonald's protégé Frank Turner, committed massive amounts of money to a system sold as essential for national security as well as convenience. ("Large-scale evacuation of cities would be needed in the event of A-bomb or H-bomb attack," Turner noted.) The highway officials who gathered in 1957 for the first national conference on urban superhighways were confident that interstates were the cure for urban blight.

The book’s subtitle could be: “Cry ‘Compassion’ and Let Slip the Dogs of Cupidity.” Or: “How James Johnson and Others (Mostly Democrats) Made the Great Recession.” The book is another cautionary tale about government’s terrifying self-confidence.

Although the outcome of Pelosi's victory over the Republican nominee for speaker, Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio, was a certainty because of the Democrats' majority in the new 110th Congress, there was a sense in the House chamber that history was being made.

Mickey never takes his eyes off the prize, but getting it will require considerable conning and cunning if he has any hope of outwitting Gorvy, Bob and that a brand new alarm system Randy (Billy Crudup) put in. The one thing Mickey has never run out of is hope. He has, however, run out of luck, with a series of complications that include the slightly unhinged Randy as an unwanted partner in crime. "Fargo"-esque in its outlook, "Thin Ice" toys with all the ways greed and avarice can trip up someone like Mickey.

After more than 10 years of war, our futures are linked. Afghanistan's many challenges - from the lack of public support for the Karzai government to widespread corruption - are rooted in politics. These problems require political solutions that can't be delivered at gunpoint. Ending the occupation could provide an opening for a diplomatic and development mission that would be not only more effective, but much less deadly and costly.
