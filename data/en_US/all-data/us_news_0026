As the sun starts to dip, take your a seat at the long table set up in the vineyard and enjoy a multi-course dinner (cooked by a guest chef) paired with Quivira wines.

Tim Spinner, 33, moving with vibrant salsas, inventive ceviches and duck-stuffed chiles en nogada in his wake, is now finally basking in his own light.

Pirate's Dinner Adventure
Take the Great Ocean Road about 70 miles west out of Melbourne and you'll hit Torquay. A road to the south eventually cuts across what used to be Mrs. Bell's farm. From parking spots above a bluff, a staircase leads down to a cove-shaped stretch of sand that is Bells Beach, the most legendary surf spot on the continent. It's celebrated as the birthplace of professional surfing, at least in Australia. Bells claims to have the world's oldest continuous pro surfing contest, going back to 1961. Part of the appeal, and the challenge, of Bells is that it's the flip side of the Gold Coast. Getting there and staying there is a chore. But it's one that feels more special than the Gold Coast (for Southern Californians, it's like the difference between Huntington Beach and Trestles). The down side is that you can make the trip all the way out to Bells and hit a day when the surf isn't up to par and the contest is off. It's a long way back to the city. I checked it out on a drive along the Great Ocean Road, one of the world's best scenic drives – Australia's version of Highway 1, except with kangaroos.

But for the most part, the studies of alcohol and its health effects have been based on calculations of people's average daily consumption, not on their actual drinking patterns. Downing seven drinks one day a week is obviously not a good idea, even though that would average out to a drink a day.
In the meantime, she vowed, the show will go on as planned Aug. 8-14.

Ambrose Channel is producing stripers on eels. The only problem is the bluefish that eat up a lot of eels some days. Those blues can be jigged when birds pinpoint their presence. What you should use? Eels for stripers, and metal jigs for blues. Why is today a good day for this? Good weather and calm seas should produce good catches during ideal drifts.

Patrick Dietrick and Mark Sullivan both are party appointees; but each said he needed to know more about the cost and complexity of releasing the data, as well as the privacy implications.
A: Aside from the fact that it's illegal? That's like saying, "Aside from that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?" I'm sure many people copy CDs checked out from the library because it's impossible for the library to know whether a CD has been copied. But it definitely is a violation of copyright law. The Recording Industry Association of America - which, by the way, you don't want to mess with - says that it's OK to copy a CD for personal use only if "the copy is made from an authorized original CD that you legitimately own." Checking out a CD from a public library doesn't qualify.

"The Kid With a Bike" is another empathetic film by Jean- Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the brothers from Belgium who have strong sympathy for alienated children and young people, and who avoid melodrama and sensation in telling their stories so movingly. There are two things that could go seriously wrong in young Cyril's life, but they don't quite happen. The Dardennes don't wring us out like that. They prefer the drama of ordinary life, in which for a boy like Cyril things don't easily go right. In straightforward, realistic scenes, they show a boy who fears he has been thrown away, but persists in feeling that his father only lost him and will be happy to find him again.

What can hitters do? Well, the data shows that they've often stood and watched the fastball go by. It's one of the reasons why Lynn has a first-pitch strike rate of 67 percent. I'd expect to see the batters take a move aggressive approach by swinging at the Lynn fastball early in the counts.

Republican hawks such as Sen. John McCain, of Arizona, praised the escalation but criticized the exit date; Democratic doves such as Sen. Russell D.

Initiated in October 2008, Healthy Howard provides comprehensive, affordable health care to working-class families and individuals who have incomes higher than the eligibility level for entitlement programs like Medicaid, but still too low to afford private health insurance. Based on the primary care "medical home" model, with an emphasis on wellness and preventive services, Healthy Howard uses a local, federally qualified health center as our primary care home, paying the health center a monthly capitated rate for each Healthy Howard member, funded by the modest premiums ($50 to $85 per month, depending on income) paid by each member. These premiums also pay for contracts for lab work and most imaging procedures.

Keep the Hawks here and forget about an NHL franchise; whether we 'deserve' a NHL team or not is irrelevant, a true 'pro' game would ruin the atmosphere and the fun and frivolity. Support the Winterhawks and those long term fans AND the families that help the young men adjust to Portland and to being on their own. Many 'team' families have been doing this for over 20 years! THAT'S another story I want to hear about; those dedicated 'foster' Mom's and Dads.

Overall, Hulu is a big improvement over rivals such as Joost, which requires you to download a player that plants itself on your desktop and keeps jabbing you in the ribs with annoying pop-ups and invitations to share content with your friends. When I was settling down to watch an episode of the old ABC drama "Twin Peaks" and tried to remove a Joost pop-up for a credit-card company, I instead got kicked immediately into a commercial for the same advertiser. Not fun.

Kashif Moore was thought to be a day three pick by some experts, but the 5-foot-9, 180-pound wide receiver went undrafted.

Heartbreaking as these stories are, "Bully" is too narrow in scope to be anything approaching definitive. Most notably absent from the film are the bullies themselves. No effort is made to cross the divide and examine the heart of the bully. Who are these kids who call names, who punch, who threaten to cut another kid's face off for no reason? How can we address the problem when we don't understand its source?

How about a candidate who cares about 100%? Who cares about everybody and gives them the opportunity to be able to rise in society. Not just to do that with energy and manufacturing jobs but also to understand that unless we have strong families and strong communities, we're not gonna be an economically successful country. We certainly won't be able to have limited government, lower taxes, if the family continues to disintegrate. In America today, a single-parent family versus a two-parent family -- as far as poverty rates -- a two-parent family in America have an 8% poverty rate in America. Single parent families -- as heroic as single moms are to provide, to care, to nurture, to do all the things that two parents were designed to do -- the poverty rate is approaching 40%.

"I probably would have ended up signing somewhere else," Aldridge said. "Think about it. I was the last option out of those guys, so they both would have gotten max deals, and they wouldn't have given me my deal (five years, $62.5 million). They only signed me because I was the only low post threat left on the team. If they had Greg, they don't give me the number I wanted, and I'm somewhere else. I think about it all the time. I wouldn't even be here had Greg not gotten hurt."

Santorum, like any suddenly emerging challenger, is a blank canvas on which the Romney campaign will write. It has already made large ad purchases, which are not likely to feature positive Romney bio spots. But when it comes to negative attacks, the Romney campaign does not yet have Santorum's number. Santorum did vote for earmarks and a congressional pay raise. But these crimes against conservatism pale in comparison to Romney's own. Santorum supported debt-ceiling increases. But this distasteful legislative responsibility has also been performed by most of Romney's congressional allies. Santorum is no libertarian but neither is Romney. On the size and role of government, Romney has a serious log-in-his-own-eye problem.

Some of us -- OK, me -- still sold Masterson short last year. Not in predicting he'd have trouble repeating his delivery at his size for nine innings though that was part of it.

A variant of the system remains in use in Iran today, a millennium after Persians first used one like it.

2009 Pillsbury Wine Co. Roan Red, Cochise County ($20-$22) - (63 percent Grenache, 25 percent Mourvedre, 12 percent Syrah.) This wine is shockingly light in color; I expected an American Rhone-like darkness, but it's more like a French Rhone Grenache. This is good! The aroma has sexy appeal from the American Oak resin and cedar, with juicy ripe red fruit. The taste has a balanced pepper grip while being rounded out with lush fruit. It's really all it should be. 90 points.

But, warns Giusti, a superhigh ORAC value, which is measured in a test tube, doesn't automatically mean the juice will perform as well in the body.

Judge Sheridan denied Mr. Traister’s application for the preliminary injunction. This case is still pending before the Federal District Court.

As for the oils, just a little bit goes a long way. And at $25 for a 375-milliliter bottle  available at Kendall Jackson winery in Sonoma County or through WholeVine's website  that's probably a good thing.

Still, the thought of running the organization excited her. The next day a recruiter called. Slusser interviewed, was offered the job, took a pay cut and said she hasn't looked back.

"The improvement project currently underway on the SR-91, between the SR-241 toll road and SR-55 freeway, will include a reconfiguring of some of the ramps," Scheper says. "The Imperial on-ramp will be realigned as part of the project, but the lane stripping will remain the same. However, the eastbound SR-91 off-ramps at Weir Canyon Road, Lakeview Avenue and Imperial will then have two lanes."
The alleged benefits to Julia are exaggerated or nonexistent. Pity the poor thing if she depends on Head Start for her launch into the world. A study by the Department of Health and Human Services last year found that positive educational effects tend to wear off by the first grade. The government assistance she gets for financing college feeds into the maw of inexorable tuition increases. The chances that the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is going to boost her pay, as a Web designer, are essentially nil. Julia is getting punked.
He also knows how loyal the fans have been and how they have been thirsting for a title for 16 years. Mendes, the club’s longest-serving player, is hoping to deliver as he gets the start today in place of the suspended Jan Gunnar Solli when the Red Bulls play the Los Angeles Galaxy in the first leg of the Western Conference semifinals at 3 p.m. at Red Bull Arena.

“It's a diet and exercise program,” Jackson said. “We're trying to get the word out on how to manage it. I didn't love going to the doctor, like most people don't. I was supposed to go every year and I only went every two years. Maybe.”

Industry and government commitments to reduce medical errors have helped, as have tracking systems. But clearly some hospitals have yet to embrace a culture of responsibility.
COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Coaches hate labels. So forget the spread. But as the Ohio State coaches have spent eight hours a day in recent weeks creating an offense under the direction of new coach Urban Meyer, let new offensive coordinator Tom Herman get more descriptive with just what it's going to look like.
"The people in Florida and New York are more interactive," he says. "I'll get some sass from them in a good way. Florida audiences remind me of New York."
He also vowed, "We are going to go to Tampa (site of the Republican National Convention in August) to fight for an American energy independence plan so no American president will ever again bow to a Saudi king." But he didn't say that he would fight on for the nomination as he has in previous speeches but instead said he wanted "to be sure conservatism is fully represented in Tampa."
"This is the first time these pictures have ever been printed like this,'' said Philip Adam, the California Historical Society's photographer.

Traveling through China some years ago, I was surprised to see acupuncturists offering their services in hotel lobbies alongside the shoeshine stands, snack racks and gift shops. Some members of our group availed themselves, with no ill effects and, they said, some relief for aching backs or sore shoulders.
Almost to a witness, the argument for same-sex marriage was the same: anecdotal stories relating embarrassing encounters with people in New Jersey and other states who were ignorant of the significance of a civil union; or an institution’s computerized system did not have the ability to register same-sex civil union couples and, in doing so, denied various civil union couples their due recognition.
That's more than 8 hours faster than the Starlight travels today from San Jose to L.A., folks.
Brindisi did "Spelling Bee" with Latté Da last fall, her first significant professional production after graduating from UMD. When that show closed, she moved in November to New York, "where no one knows me."

Diagnostic tests available include pH monitoring either with a catheter down the nose or with an innovative wireless device placed in the esophagus. In select cases, special X-ray studies using a dye to illustrate the anatomy or plumbing of the upper tract may be beneficial. We also may perform an upper endoscopy exam to visualize the tissue and, if needed, take biopsies to further define the cause and extent of disease. Biopsies are especially useful in patients with an allergic predisposition such as asthma, allergies, eczema or a family history of gastro-esophageal reflux disease.

Roberts had three hits to lead USC while Landecker and Matt Foat had two apiece.
The Browns' problems began in about 1992 when owner Art Modell and the city of Cleveland thought they had come up with a $125 million plan to renovate old Cleveland Stadium. Modell, who had taken over operation of the stadium when the city no longer could afford it, paid $70,000 for the plan to be drawn up and presented during a news conference.

Salt Fork State Park near Cambridge -- at 17,229 acres, the state's largest -- is expected to draw the most immediate interest from oil and gas companies. For one thing, the state owns the mineral rights under most of this park, which isn't the case at many of the state parks (and when the state doesn't own the mineral rights, it can't lease them to oil companies).
Harvion L. Cameron, 20, of the 700 block of South Fifth Street in St. Charles, and Jeffery D. Lottie, 22, of the 300 block of Oakborough Drive near Lake Saint Louis, were charged with the same crimes shortly after Brennan's killing. Patton originally was charged as a juvenile. A judge signed an order Wednesday allowing prosecutors to charge him as an adult.

The St. Louis Chamber Chorus will perform a program of classics by the likes of Bach, Gesualdo and Purcell that have been finished or reconstructed by scholars and composers including Stravinsky and John Rutter. As usual, the venue has been chosen to match the music, and this one is a standout in a lot of ways: St. Alphonsus Liguori "Rock" Roman Catholic Church, itself beautifully reconstructed after a lightning strike to the church roof caused a five-alarm fire in 2007.
Robert Patrick and Denise Hollinshed of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report.
But Mandel did not spend the night, said the spokesman, Travis Considine, adding that Mandel traveled using campaign funds, not taxpayer money. Considine said he did not know how much money Mandel raised at the Bahamas event.
Perry is hardly the only GOP candidate to troll for votes in these murky waters. Virtually the entire Republican field went to Washington recently to court attendees at Ralph Reed's Faith and Freedom Conference. Sarah Palin, who has written that Kennedy was wrong in his speech, and Rep. Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota, both play up their evangelical connections. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum wears his conservative Catholicism so prominently on his sleeve that you'd think he was running for archbishop.
The couple was given a summons to appear in Jersey City Municipal Court, he said.
"We worked so hard to get this to pass," said Karen, who agreed to talk only on the condition that her last name was not used because she and her family are not in the country legally. "We just want an education."

A gray-haired woman in a green floral dress is screaming the worst moment of her life in front of the entire world. Luisa Seau stands in front of microphones, in front of cameras, on televisions across the country wailing the sometimes incoherent words of every mother’s worst nightmare.
There was the decision in 1986 to split the stores -- with Norm getting those in Washington, Danielson's dad running the Oregon stores, and Val working with both. There were the changing expectations of what supermarkets were, from the place to buy food to the Fred Meyer model of one-stop shopping.
Asked if that meant schools and towns should not expect aid increases, he said: "From a planning point of view, we have to look at (this year’s) spending levels as a baseline."
"He snuck in," says Villalobos, smiling and squinting in the afternoon sun under the rim of his Giants hat. "But he wanted tickets."

He stated his expectation that Illinois should compete for Big Ten championships, and when the football and men's basketball teams finished their seasons with significant swoons, he moved quickly.
Levy supporters this week indicated that they would want to extend the extra health levy even if the U.S. Supreme Court upholds the Affordable Care Act this summer. While the act could help provide money for indigent care and lessen the need for city funds, they said, that could take years to sort out. So city money would be needed far beyond 2014, they claimed.
She said that while 9/11 destroyed Hoboken's sense of security, it also made its residents better appreciate where they live.
Tennis needs a dress code. When I turn on the TV and see Serena Williams, I’m not sure if I’m watching the French Open or “Project Runway.”
There also appears to be an obsession with other people's underwear. One article after another quotes indignant Americans huffing and puffing over the possible horror of seeing grandma's waist-highs flapping in the breeze.
"I don't see anything in the Club for Growth's agenda that would have been at all helpful to me as a young businessman and entrepreneur in actually creating jobs and businesses in America," said Lugar, who helped manage the family's food machinery manufacturing business before running for office. "The Chamber of Commerce is proposing the creation of new jobs, a business climate in terms of taxation and spending that is likely to give that kind of atmosphere. "
However, Marzilli said Chrysler's brand perception dropped significantly in February after its Super Bowl commercial with Clint Eastwood aired.

Cowboys: They didn't meet with Claiborne at the combine or bring him to Valley Ranch for a pre-draft visit. They didn't even make the standard call in the week before the draft to get an updated phone number. But they are close to the LSU coaches and had all the information they needed. When Blackmon was off the board for the Rams at No. 6, the pick was for sale. Giving up a second-rounder to jump eight spots into the top six for an elite corner at a need position was a reasonable price. Why make the move? Eli Manning threw for almost 800 yards in two games against Rob Ryan's putrid secondary last year.
“After the shows, I basically went back to Toledo,” Calhoun said.
No. I'll let others put him in. Bonds was enabled by executives, managers and teammates for most of his career. I'm sure he will find more of the same among the BBWAA electorate, though probably not a 75 percent percentage. It's up to the National Baseball Hall of Fame to change its voting procedure if it wishes to include those who ripped off the game. The tragedy is that Bonds had HOF credentials before using. Of course, others with HOF credentials also sit outside enshrinement. Eventually the Veterans Committee will review the tainted cases. In this instance, allowing some of Bonds' peers to pass judgment seems very appropriate.
"It's really easy to track the reasons why," he said. "In the early 1990s there was a huge over-build in the industry."
Saunders was struck by a shot off the bat of the Cleveland Indians' Carlos Santana in the first inning and was pulled. He said he had a little trouble pushing off with the leg in his delivery when he took some warmup tosses.
When the Shawnee first hit the water in 1916, she was a striking beauty — a 72-foot sailboat made of old-growth oak and Douglas fir, African mahogany, naturally curved hackmatack and gleaming teak. Her hull had the seductive curve of a wineglass. Her keel was 37,000 pounds of lead capped by a single slab of carved oak stretching stem to stern.
Windsor, Ontario, wants a new bridge, the auto companies want a new bridge, Gov. Rick Snyder wants a new bridge, even Matty Moroun wants a new bridge. But like everything else in this city and state, nothing is getting done while we bicker endlessly over selfish interests. Meanwhile, the world is passing us by. Michigan has wasted enough time; a compromise is necessary.
Offensive lineman Herman Johnson, a fifth-round pick, was with the Cardinals only one year, too. The Cardinals hoped Johnson would eventually contend for a job at guard or tackle. Instead, he couldn't control his weight and is currently out of the NFL, too. The Giants cut him last August.
By the late 1990s, Mr. Williams realized that his job had changed. California's future was no longer tied to the broader economy, but to a small group of ultra-earners. To predict the state's revenue, he had to start forecasting the fortunes of the rich. That meant forecasting the performance of stocks—specifically, a handful of high-tech stocks.
"The timing is going to be different," Matheny acknowledges. "You're not going to have as many changes. There's going to be less structure about how to use the bullpen. I'm not saying I've got everything figured out."

Manion and Clemons will join trombonist Clark Gayton and trumpeters Curt Ramm and Barry Danielian in the E Street Band's brass and woodwind section. Gayton and Ramm have toured with Bruce Springsteen before. Barry Danelian is a relative newcomer to Team Springsteen, but he's a respected sideman and a music industry veteran who has accompanied Paul Simon, Blood, Sweat and Tears, Billy Joel, and many other prominent acts. He played with the Boss (and Manion, Gayton and Ramm) at the Carousel House show in Asbury Park in December 2010.

Environmental groups and other scientists, however, have raised numerous questions about the novel endeavor, including whether it will really work or if it might have unintended environmental consequences that could be difficult to anticipate.
The Town Hall meeting comes in the midst of a modest artistic renaissance for Warwick. In her fifth decade in the music industry, she’s been applying her classic voice to styles of music that she’s previously drawn from, but never fully embraced. The stirring “Why We Sing,” released in 2008, is the purest gospel album in her catalog. Likewise, “Only Trust Your Heart,” released earlier this year, is her first true jazz set. Devoted to interpretations of Sammy Cahn materia, it’s a relaxed tour through the songbook of a classic American tunesmith (“If You Can Dream,” “The Second Time Around”). The performances as so assured that it’s a little hard to believe that Warwick wasn’t already a fan of Cahn.

AUGUSTA, Ga. — All signs pointed to this being a Masters for the ages.
Taylor is a senior.
The casino's designer, Sir William Chambers, furiously busy in London as a court architect to King George III, never managed to find the opportunity to steal away and see the actual building before his death in 1796. He and the better-known Adam brothers were the architects responsible for introducing the neoclassic aesthetic to England, replacing the Baroque through their commissions for country houses, palaces and furniture. This one small building, an experiment in conjuring the grandeur of ancient Rome and Greece, contains the germ of an idea from which whole cities would later be built, first in Europe and then in America. Jefferson would have loved it.
According to an invite, the event at the AGC Townhouse near the Capitol (AGC stands for the Associated General Contractors of America) begins at 6 p.m. Tickets start at $500 per person and go up to $2,500 for a politcal action committee that wants to be counted as a host of the event.

After a cup of the stuff was slid my way and I took some sips, I began to feel that Baijiu was more than just a drink. It was Beijing in a bottle. It reminded me of riding in Chinese buses, of touring around a car-choked downtown. What is this taste? I asked aloud, and a local at my table was quick to reply: "It tastes like diesel fuel!" he said, clapping his hands and laughing delightedly.
