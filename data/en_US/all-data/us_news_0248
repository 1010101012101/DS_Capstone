Follow the hostess up the steep backlit stairs past a window looking onto the lower level lounge (there's another bar half a flight up from the main dining room). Floor-to-ceiling windows look out on the dark sea and the glinting lights of the pier. The crowd is prosperous-looking and much more dressed up than the diners at nearby M.B. Post. You see suits and ties, Italian sport jackets, designer dresses and major bags. They're here for the action, and loving the idea of not having to drive to the city for a taste of upscale night life.

One of the pieces of good news is the restored El Cortez. One of the city's oldest casinos, it was operated by gangster Bugsy Siegel before he built the Flamingo out beyond the city limits (a move that earned him a bullet in the face from unhappy mob financiers). The hotel recently installed a sign with both retro neon script and an LED screen used to advertise shows and deals.
But everyone in the building knew that he was going to take a 3-pointer if he had a good look. Heck, Allen didn't have a good look and rushed an awful first attempt at a dagger 20 seconds earlier.

King Kamehameha the Great is celebrated royally every June 11, a state holiday in Hawai'i, with parades, festivals and other tributes. This year also marks the 200th anniversary of his unification of the Hawaiian islands — achieved by bloody conquests from the Big Island to O'ahu and by the peaceful capitulation of Kaua'i and Ni'ihau. His statues in Honolulu and on the Big Island must be the archipelago's most-photographed artworks, while his name resounds throughout the islands, especially since four more monarchs bore it after him. Yet there's a lot more to learn about the first Kamehameha, and tracing his route through the islands — minus the war canoes — is a memorable way to do so.

•The new general manager of the storied Montreal Canadiens is Marc Bergevin, remembered in these parts for his stint with the Whalers in the early 1990s. He beat out broadcaster Pierre McGuire, remembered in these parts for his stint as Whalers coach 1993-94. And Bergevin's first move was to dump interim head coach Randy Cunneyworth, remembered in these parts for his five-year stint with the Whalers. Do you smell a trend? The NHL left Hartford 15 years ago, but we can connect just about every coaching staff and front office to the Whalers. Dave Tippett, Kevin Dineen, John Anderson and many others are coaching, Ron Francis is in the Carolina front office, Pat Verbeek works for the Lightning and Mark Howe scouts for the Red Wings. Yes, lots of NHL people still have "Brass Bonanza" buzzing through their heads. ... The NFL suspended four players in connection with the Saints' bounty scandal. Linebacker Jonathan Vilma is gone for the 2012 season, defensive lineman Anthony Hargrove received an eight-game penalty, defensive end Will Smith a four-game penalty and linebacker Scott Fujita will miss three games. Hargrove now plays for Green Bay and Fujita is with Cleveland, so some of the punishment doesn't directly impact the Saints.

There was something very ’60s about her but also something sort of ’90s. My friend comes out with her and it’s a short ride back to the studio and I was thinking, ‘This ain’t gonna work.’ ”

A: In February of '09, I had a medical condition that had put me on bed rest. I was watching a TV show about an obesity clinic, and I was watching people 400 or 500 pounds having to be cut out of their houses.

Boston: LF Carl Crawford could be sidelined for three months due to a left elbow injury, the Boston Globe reported. Crawford began the season on the disabled list following arthroscopic left wrist surgery, and his rehab was slowed by the elbow ailment. ...

It's precisely this attempt to marginalize people who don't adhere to the increasingly prevalent culturally Marxist views that drives them to seek out and support democratic entities (like Ms. Le Pen's National Front party) that accord them a proper public voice. That's how it's done in civil societies. Where's the alarmism in that? If dialogue around these issues is quashed or marginalized, the parties championing these concerns will serve as pressure valves and grow in popularity. This partly explains the National Front's record electoral figure -- but it's not the whole story.

For your second problem, you don't say whether you planted the trees or inherited them. Many people prune the center of citrus so the fruit will be on the outside and easy to pick. Citrus is generally pruned only for safety and health issues. If you prune upwards, you are removing the best part for fruit development. For size containment, you can prune back about a foot several times a year, but I would suggest contacting an arborist who is familiar with working with citrus. Be aware that the bark will sunburn if it is pruned incorrectly and opened to the sun.

Zoe, an aspiring actress, and Daryl, a writer and baby sitter, discover they are more co-dependent than they wish to admit.

Ron: Well, both exhibits will generate reflection  at Cobo, off the fenders; at the DIA, on Rembrandts long quest to find the face of Jesus.

In real life, such a child would likely be institutionalized, universally reviled, or relocated and renamed to protect him. That isn't the case in "I Hunt Killers," which requires a leap of faith that Jazz is compassionate enough to have a best friend, a girlfriend and the town sheriff as a surrogate father.

But there was more: Holmquist and general director Evan Luskin told Streshinsky that they wanted the piece set specifically at the Lyric Theatre and that the fictional opera company onstage should be the Lyric Opera. A highfalutin word, the idea would be "postmodern" or, if you prefer, "metatheatrical," but what it boils down to is a self-referential sort of theater in which no effort is made to conceal the artifice of stagecraft.
She says: "This past Christmas, we purchased a huge, modern picture of my husband from the artist Paul Gerben, whose studio is located in SoHo. It was great to be directly in touch with the artist himself, which enabled us to create this fantastic, very large and abstract piece that we love."

Q: Ira, in Monday's game, LeBron was directing this team with the kind of legitimate, genuine on-court leadership that we haven't seen from him. It can't be a coincidence that he is also performing at a very efficient level on both ends of the court.

We've seen this tactic used by politicians before when voters endorsed another project based on pie-in-the-sky promises and limited information -- high-speed rail. Remember? State legislators provided voters with no information on the real costs or the potential impacts from train routes and track configurations. The result? Widespread voters' remorse when the true statewide impacts from high-speed rail were finally disclosed.

However, the Reverse Birthday Party approach lets you divest things which have little resale or practical value, but can still give your friends some amusement. Items like old family photos, or the outdated calendar with the cool train pictures. A matchbook collection. One of your kid's paintings. A used and mostly cleaned-out bird cage. That stupid golf trophy I won for hitting the shortest drive. A usable bottle of Formby's, or a book about managing family finances.

The Bears, though, are convinced they can make do with what they have. As discombobulated as the offensive line play seemed to be in Mike Martz's offense, Jay Cutler was sacked only nine times in a seven-game stretch in which the Bears were 6-1. They averaged 144 rushing yards per game in that span, which is pretty good. And that was without Gabe Carimi at right tackle.

That doesn't resonate with office workers like Miranda Egri, who recently found out that her early-bird parking rate will jump from $7.50 to $9 a day on Tuesday. The 28-year-old Boston native thought she was getting a deal on cheap parking at Frankfort Avenue and West Third Street.

Homemade vinegar has a complex flavor and vibrant color that beats anything you'll find on a store shelf. Just-add-wine vinegar-making kits from Berkeley's Oak Barrel Winecraft transform ordinary folk into master vinegar-makers. Red wine starter sets offer a safer bet for the virginal vinaigrier, as the ruby-colored liquid harbors fewer protective sulfites than its straw-colored sibling. A glass demijohn kit costs $40-$50, while an elegant oak barrel set -- choose French or American -- creates a more complex product, but sets you back $125-$220.

One of my opponents likes to say that it's "time to turn the page" on San Diego's past. It would be reckless and irresponsible of us to forget how our sports teams have treated this city for the last two decades. Our city has been held ransom by our sports teams, a fact we cannot forget.

Hence this book's title, and hence its almost novella-like nature, at least in comparison with Tyler's other works, which often span decades and generations. "The Beginner's Goodbye" confines itself to months, specifically the months following the death of Aaron's wife, Dorothy. The two are in the middle of an ordinary marital moment — Aaron comes home early from work with a cold, the two have a small quarrel over care-taking and the location of the Triscuits — when a tree falls on the house, inflicting wounds on Dorothy from which she eventually dies and wounds on Aaron from which he eventually learns how to live.

One problem is that today it's so easy to get a hold of copyrighted content without paying for it. This was not always the case. When I was a kid, for example, we didn't have CDs or iPods. Back then, the only "digital" aspect of music was the finger you kept poised and ready to push the "record" button as you patiently waited for the next time "Private Eyes" by Hall & Oates came on the radio. Then, inevitably, your decidedly "lo-fi," pirated version of the song would include a portion in the middle when your mother came in and yelled at you to clean up your room, followed by the sound of a door slamming and you screaming that she's ruining your life. But, otherwise a clean recording.
You'll want to ask questions to find out what a nanny's discipline strategy is. You'll also want to get a sense of her energy level and creativity, says Bugbee. Ask, "What kinds of activities do you like to do with kids?" and see if she has ideas for things to do that don't necessarily cost a lot of money. And you want someone who will actively play with your child, not just sit and watch.

ø"It was a perfect storm of technology. To get that much exposure on a worldwide basis had never happened that way. If YouTube hadn't come around, if that character (Achmed) hadn't come around…it all met at the perfect time, and that's when things started going bonkers. Growing up, I thought it would be great if I could do big theaters. Now we're doing arenas. I thought it would be amazing to play foreign countries, and now we're doing that. We sold out Helsinki on Easter. It just shows you what technology has done. It's made the world such a smaller place."

A school choice advocate says he's preparing to open three charter schools in the unaccredited Riverview Gardens School District and possibly two in St. Charles County if legislation passes allowing for charter school expansion in Missouri.
But the eyes and the tongue do not always agree. The pizzas, which come out of that glorious brick oven, are a mixed bag. The crust is solid, but it's not a game changer like Great Lake's or even as variable in texture, i.e. featuring a satisfying-mix of puff, crispiness and char, such as the ones served up at Spacca Napoli. The "Pork Belly Meatball" pizza, featuring dry, tasteless meat hunks defies the wisdom that pork makes everything better. The "Sicilian" pizza ups the game with pungent fennel, sweet winey bursts of raisin and luscious pork sausage. My favorite though is probably the meat-free "Capriole Goat Cheese," a savory fruitcake-like pizza studded with crunchy hazelnut, plummy dates, melted leeks and woodsy-thyme brightened by a splash of balsamico.
Judith Gans, manager of the immigration-policy program at the University of Arizona, agreed that some American workers may benefit by illegal immigrants leaving the state. And she agreed that illegal immigrants tend to consume more services than what they pay for in taxes because they work in low-paying jobs. But low-skilled legal workers also consume more in services than they pay for in taxes, she said. If anything, she said, replacing illegal workers may increase government costs because legal workers are entitled to social services that illegal immigrants don't qualify for.

It has helped, yet in conversations with voters it is also clear that plenty of Mr. Romney's resurgence rests on the doubts he's sown about Mr. Santorum. This is where the Romney money and organization have consistently proven most effective—in making the race about his competitors. He did it to Rick Perry in Iowa and to Newt Gingrich in Florida. And he's doing it to Mr. Santorum here, in a race that has become largely a fight over how to define the Pennsylvanian.

Kym's giving Jaleel a koala that talks with an Australian accent as a reward for doing so well last week. Lordy - I think her rehearsal outfit is a strong contender for this week's "Why Straight Men Should Watch This Show" picture. They're doing the Viennese Waltz to the "Downton Abbey" theme, "Did I Make the Most of Loving You?" Again, lots of dry ice. Jaleel is occasionally making some weird shapes with his legs, particularly during turns and spins. Len liked it "enough not to be cruel, but not enough to be kind."
