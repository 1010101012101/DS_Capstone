What's even better than energy-efficient lighting is turning off lights and other devices when not being used. By just turning things off, you can save 10 percent or more in utility cost.

At the back of the shop, which consists of little more than a sink and a curtained dressing cabin, a beige linen jacket from the spring collection hangs on a mannequin. It's a one-button sportscoat, inspired by what the English call a morning coat. The lapels, neither wide nor narrow, meet for one brief moment before sweeping apart en route up to the shoulders. Miller loves cutaway shirt collars, and the rounded one he's paired with this nicely replicates its artful, easy lines. Interestingly, the jacket is made out of upholstery fabric. All that finesse, and yet it doesn't mind being sat on.

Do it now, because simply growing government is more important than the practicalities of any new program.

øMeanwhile, availability for the new iPhone 4S is still elusive. Apple sold 4 million of the phones worldwide last weekend, but phones have been hard to come by since.

That one example has been out there for awhile. Where are the rest?

The play examines a strange kind of rivalry, between Legba, who longs for the sexual and emotional closeness he could enjoy with Oshoosi in prison, and Ogun, who has spent his life trying to control his brother’s taste for trouble. It is Oshoosi’s story, really, his journey of self-discovery (as “Red and Brown” is the childless woman Oya’s journey and “Marcus; Or the Secret of Sweet” is that of the young, gay title character). But Legba and Ogun loom larger in the cycle as a whole -- Legba as almost a trickster figure of the psychosexual, and Ogun as the stalwart, supportive presence in the lives of conflicted central characters.

But the parents and families of autistic children say that depictions of such extraordinary stories risk misleading the public unless they are balanced with more varied accounts. People with autism may be highly intelligent chatterboxes or nearly catatonic, but broadly speaking, it's characterized by impaired social function, difficulty with communication, and repetitive movements.

According to a history of steganography published at www.sans.org by the SANS Institute, a nonprofit training center for information security specialists, one form was the infamous microdot used by the Nazis during World War II. The dots were essentially microfilm chips the size of periods on a standard typewriter, and sometimes disguised as precisely that. In an earlier example, steganography was used for signposts along the Underground Railroad. They took the form of quilts hung from the windowsills of abolitionists, ostensibly to dry in the sun, but in reality used to direct runaway slaves to freedom using symbols disguised as patterns stitched into the quilts.
She had facilitated his writing during an anguished time when she was so miserable that she started seeing a psychiatrist, a step that Charles angrily opposed.

Snipers have quietly emerged as one of the most effective but least understood weapons in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

I know many people, like one poll respondent, insist on their "thoroughbred" animals. I have no fault with responsible hobby breeders who have their breed's – not their bank account's – best interests at heart.
The last time authorities in the Caribbean intervened on a gay cruise was in February 2011, when agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection arrested a California man aboard the Allure of the Seas, which had docked in St. Thomas.

There are three clearly defined groups of visitors on which every Super City relies. In no order of impact they are: the actual fans with tickets, the hustlers and rustlers who live off the game through extra-curricular means, and the “standing-arounders.”
But there is not a member of the House of Representatives who didn't make a conscious choice to be a member of the House of Representatives. They knew what they were getting into. I don't feel like I'm in a room full of people with an approval rating of 12 to 15 percent. That's not part of my consciousness at all.
Still, tea party observers such as Foley and Skocpol say the movement may be here to stay. The tea party, Foley said, is "in the fabric of every community. You may not see it, because they're not holding signs. But they're there."

The doctoring Wednesday was part of a military program to provide free health care in poor areas of the South and whose latest mission came to one of Alabama's most impoverished regions, where the teams have treated more than 12,000 people in less than two weeks. The work helps fill a gap in an area with few doctors and a multitude of medical problems, many of them linked to the obesity that is rampant in the state.
When you're a character in a Disney/Pixar movie, you have to be careful what you wish for, because somewhere there's a witch or wise old woman willing to grant it. The Wise Woman of Brave, voiced by Julie Walters, gives a girl who is unhappy with her station in life exactly what she asks for. Your wish is granted, my pretty, on June 22.

Recent research by the National Bureau of Economic Research on the effectiveness of a gifted education program in a middle school in the Southwest found little difference in achievement among those who got accepted to the program and those who narrowly missed it. Experts say the study raises important questions about how to best design and implement programs to raise achievement among gifted students. The best outcomes and gains come from programs that specifically address the needs of the students they admit, Olszewski-Kubilius said.
Two years later, Davis was drafted into the U.S. Army. For two years, he was head coach of a military football team at Ft. Belvoir, Va., that lost only two games during his tenure. Typically, his actions raised eyebrows. His methods for landing former college and pro players who had been drafted into the military nearly led to a congressional investigation.
The next time we are tempted to deny others their freedom, we might consider the words of R.C. Hoiles, a man who carried the torch of freedom by repeating timeless principles. The lesson of his life: Embrace freedom and never let go, even when it is unpopular. You will earn the respect of your enemies and the admiration of your supporters. For this and more, I say, "Thank you, Mr. Hoiles."

About 8:30 p.m. Saturday,the first 911 calls filtered in. Police responded to a home on the 3200 block of S. 147th Place and found chaos. Upwards of 30 people were fighting on a makeshift dance floor in the backyard, police said.
There are legitimate questions to be asked and the only way to ask them with any force is to employ a special prosecutor to investigate and determine whether Mason ignored evidence of widespread criminal wrongdoing under his watch or even participated in the culture of corruption. It seems likely that the federal authorities might be asking these questions, but unless Mason is secretly cooperating with the feds and his beneficial contributions to that investigation will be explained at the end of the process, he appears to be cloaked with a Teflon shield that is insulating him from serious consequences.
Under current law, illegal immigration is a federal crime, and state law enforcement officials can ask about someone's immigration status only if they're suspected of another crime.
That changed this year, when North Plains Christian Church chartered Boy Scout Troop 275. Darrel Smith, a scout master and Eagle Scout, leads the troop for boys 11 through 18 years old. The group so far has only one patrol of 11- and 12 year-olds, but expects other patrols to form as word gets out about the new troop.
Last season: Steelers made one last run with group that led franchise to three Super Bowl appearances in six seasons, only to be undone by Tim Tebow in wild-card loss to Broncos. Defense was first in league in yards allowed but last in takeaways and lacked nasty streak that defined unit for most of last decade. Offense became reliant on QB Ben Roethlisberger, who was exposed behind makeshift offensive line that had trouble protecting him. Late-season ankle injury to Roethlisberger likely cost Steelers division title and perhaps a much different postseason fate.
Christie vetoed legislation in July that would have fully restored the $7.5 million. Proponents said the funding could come from an employee prescription drug program that they said was overfunded, but the administration questioned the legitimacy of that funding source.

Have we found a No. 1 defenseman in Shane O'Brien? He didn't get a star in the game against Calgary but he was the best skater on the ice. He is not afraid to try and make plays and he wants to be a difference maker each shift.
Politics will always be at play in law enforcement. Turf's a big issue, and the job attracts people with strong personalities. Those raising concerns about the agency aren't trying to destroy it; they're trying desperately to improve it. This agency's mission -- forging unique multiagency partnerships to fight gang crime -- remains vital to the Twin Cities. Those who truly value the Gang Strike Force will be the ones putting aside old quarrels and working to rebuild it.
Bonamici wound up in an animated conversation with one small businesswoman who bluntly asked the would-be congresswoman if she was going to raise her taxes.

Democrats say a constitutional amendment would be too difficult to tweak if issues arise. They warn of major municipal cuts that would leave towns without ambulance and police service, schools without teachers and a creative rash of fee increases. Instead, the legislative version would allow exemptions for issues Democrats say are beyond towns' immediate control, such as rising health care and energy costs, pension obligations and cuts in state aid.

I spoke to a bunch of lawyers yesterday, and all said they thought Taymor’s suit would be settled. There’s simply too much at stake. For the $80 million “Spider-Man” to have a shot at recouping, it’s going to have to spawn productions around the world. The producers are trying to raise money for such ventures. But the lawsuit, in which Taymor seeks to prevent the use of her material in future productions, is making that difficult.

Use the lunch period that you have available as a positive, energy-building time. Think of topics to discuss at lunch so you do not get stuck listening to a long tale of someone else's woes (which is very energy-draining). Make healthy, energizing food choices (less sugar, salt, caffeine and more fruit, veggies, protein and whole grains). Throughout each day consider taking two to three mini breaks. Also, allow time to celebrate something that went well, such as a positive gesture from a coworker or a good deed that you performed. Take a stretch or walk break for a few minutes, or take a few deep breaths. These actions will help you to enhance your energy. Planning a restful, inspirational or educational activity to do on your way home and upon arrival would also be good to consider.

It made sense to have U.S. troops based in Europe during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact posed a direct threat to Western Europe. Our troops served as reassurance to our allies that we wouldn't leave them in the lurch in the event of hostilities, and as a warning to the Soviets to stay put.

Unmentioned by Romney was the student-loan issue that Obama used as the centerpiece of his college visits: the doubling of the 3.4% interest rate on federal Stafford loans to undergraduates.

I voted against income tax increases because I believe that there are plenty of areas that we can cut in this budget that are not essential spending items. Marylanders are hurting in this economy, and government should trim unnecessary spending before seeking more money from its struggling citizens. I don't think that you have to vote the party line like a lamb marching off to slaughter, and I don't think that the Democratic Party stands for unnecessary taxation. That kind of group-think is what is wrong with Washington. We have too few people on either side of the aisle willing to speak out against their party. Whatever one thinks about a given issue, and reasonable people can certainly disagree, wouldn't it be better if politicians voted based on principle rather than simply politics — on policy rather than party?

DeCosta on Upshaw setting the edge: "That’s his speciality. That’s one of the things that was so attractive about him. He plays like a junkyard dog. He has a strong punch. He is a physical, dominant football player. We’re excited about that. That’s not an easy position to play. A lot of guys can’t do that. A lot of guys can rush the passer, a lot of guys can drop and play in space, but setting the edge is really one of the one most important things at that position and we feel this guy can do that."

In California's vineyards, alicante bouschet stands apart for reasons other than the deep blush of its leaves in fall. It's one of few grapes whose juice also runs red. It's a French variety, bred in the 1880s by Louis Bouschet and his son Henri, who were looking for a grape whose yields would be high and the color of the wine it yielded would be deep. It worked, and plantings surged across southern France and in Algeria, where its large crops generally went into undistinguished wines for the bulk market.

At that moment, there was only one thing to do. I stood up. From the depths of armchairs, men in their white robes and red-checked kaffiyehs stared impassively over their mugs. I felt blood rushing to my face. I dropped my eyes, and immediately wished I hadn't. Snatching up the skirts of my robe to keep from stumbling, I walked out of the store and into the clatter of the shopping mall.

Bruiser Flint's team lost Monday night in the CAA championship game to VCU, leaving the regular-season champs to wait and see if their profile is good enough for the at-large pool. The Dragons finished the season at 27-6, but lost just twice since Dec. 10 — an stretch of 25 wins in 27 games. But they have an RPI of 63 and a woeful Strength of Schedule of 225. The best win for Drexel is VCU at home earlier this season, but is it enough to off-set three losses outside of the RPI top-125?

I don't think Alex Steen will be back to full speed until next season. He missed half the schedule and returned to play seven games before the playoffs began, hardly enough time to get up to speed for playoff hockey. For that matter, I don't think David Perron is back to 100 percent either.

 Are your tomatoes showing lots of blossoms but not much fruit? Are the big green ones just staying green? Blame it on the cool summer. We're not complaining about the weather, but tomatoes, peppers, squash and melons prefer it hot with warm nights to go along with days in the high 90s. Cherry tomatoes, which need less heat, are ripening in abundance, but bigger varieties require a little more warmth to turn red.

Ah yes, the liberal-run state of Illinois ("Corruption R Us") has come up with an ingenious method of solving its $5 billion deficit! Its simply refusing to pay the state's bills! To schools, why didn't I think of that all these years?! Yes, the Illinois "method" means the state will now pay millions more to insure its debt than all the other 49 states (or is it 56? Check with Obama please), but hey, having to pay millions in interest instead of billions of debt is a no-brainer, no? I'm not too swift (being a conservative who foolishly believes in bill-paying) but eventually I catch on. I'm now drafting a letter to my personal creditors; gonna try the Illinois "method" of bill-non-paying.

Local Smoke’s Carolina sauce, vinegary and less tomatoey, is meant for the pulled pork, but you might want to spread it elsewhere; it’s that good. The three sandwiches sampled — pulled pork ($6), smoked pulled chicken ($6) and Texas brisket ($7) are all mighty tasty, but here’s my tip — order them dry. The sauce drowned out the meat, and the flavor. You can always order sauce on the side.

Andrzej Fonfara was left stranded here in 2006 when the Polish boxing promotion that had signed him to a pro contract as a teen sent him to Chicago for a fight and promptly went belly-up. Stung once, the young Fonfara and his family rationalized he had a better chance of making it in the cutthroat boxing business in America than he did back home.

When Kevin disembarked, he stood for a while in the parking lot. Then he walked out onto the span, looking for a good spot to jump, where he wouldn't hit a pillar on the way down. The sun was breaking through the fog, creating a hazy, golden light. He was crying as he walked.

When you order a strawberry Frappuccino at your neighborhood Starbucks, you're not thinking about crushed bugs. But until recently, the coffee giant was using a food coloring derived from cochineal bugs. Ick! That discovery didn't sit well with Daelyn Fortney, who blogs at ThisDishIsVeg.com.

Wacky ideas sometimes come to me when I swim laps at Brink Pool. So the other day as I was doing my aquatic workout, I came up with a solution to Pacifica's fiscal follies: Lure a government agency into moving its headquarters to Rockaway Quarry. Okay, I warned you it was a wacky idea! But really, wouldn't all those sweaty civil servants in Sacramento or Washington prefer working in our cool coastal climate? All those disgruntled local politicos who vent at City Council meetings and in the Tribune's editorial pages would sign up to become lobbyists at the new Rockaway government center. Fat-cat bureaucrats on expense accounts would fill our restaurants and motels. The high-speed rail project would extend right to Rockaway so we could stop worrying about widening Highway 1. If you like my pie-in-the-sky idea, call 1-800-FAT-CHANCE.
If possible, contact your mom's surgeon to see if she got a DePuy ASR.

On one hand, Essex and Burlington counties will argue that the Supreme Court should continue with its recent trend of giving more deference to detention facility officials to run their houses as they see fit. Essex and Burlington will contend that safety is paramount and that anyone who enters the four walls of their jails and prisons must be strip-searched, no matter the circumstances, in order to pinpoint gang members through spotting their tattoos, identify and prevent the spread of staph infections, and, most notably, prevent the smuggling in of weapons, drugs or other contraband.

What a matchup in the frontcourt between future pros DeJuan Blair and Blake Griffin. This is a bloody-your-knuckles, get-your-knees-dirty type of game. Both players have tremendous nights in this instant-classic, but everyone (as they always have) forgets about Levance Fields. Fields, the assist king, continually finds Sam Young down the stretch to set up an all-Big East title game. Pittsburgh, 75-73.

Soon after moving from Dallas to San Francisco, I discovered Rio Grill and was impressed by its Southwestern proclivities. Through the decades the interior became a little shopworn and the menu strayed from the theme, but recently, to celebrate the restaurant's 27th anniversary, the owners remodeled and in April refocused the menu. The food produced by executive chef Cy Yontz, who worked with Mark Miller at his groundbreaking Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, N.M., is called "creative regional California cuisine," but has strong Latin influences.
It was van Riemsdyk who would have had the best view of Danny Briere's subsequent overtime blast, which delivered the Flyers a 4-3 victory over New Jersey in Game 1 of their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series, except JVR didn't see the puck squirt through his own legs.
It started with a simple salad with preserved lemon vinaigrette and shavings of Parmigiano-Reggiano, followed by a purée of cauliflower soup with shrimp and spiced oil that offered nuanced and balanced flavors.

"There are so many things that appear to contribute to vulnerability to eating disorders — certain genes, the environment in which you live, the stresses of life, especially during adolescence, and the interaction among all these things," said Walsh.

The April 5 editorial "A report card for teachers" correctly asserts that the inclusion of multiple measures makes the new teacher evaluation system far more likely to lead to improved student learning then the current one.

A built-in design danger with snowboards is that both feet are secured to the board so those who fall headfirst into powder, tree wells or water can find it impossible to get out and asphyxiate. Because both feet are secured in the same direction, similar in positioning to a skateboard, boarders have a blind spot behind them that can lead to collisions.

The game room is adorned with black-and-white photos from Coney Island, which makes sense because Coney Island has a boardwalk with lots of games, too.

Notes: The Blazers are seeking to receive insurance against both of Oden's left knee injuries. Generally, insurance pays 80 percent of a player's 41-game salary after the player misses half of a season. The Blazers are attempting to get relief from both the broken patella from last season, and the microfracture surgery from this season ... Miller said the Blazers signed Brandon Roy last summer to a five-year, $82 million contract knowing that he no longer had meniscus in either knee. Roy, 26, missed his second consecutive game Thursday because of left knee pain. He will also miss Saturday's game against Utah. "When he was drafted, we knew there were problems with his knees," Miller said. "When we talked about his extension last summer, it did come into play and into the discussions. But at the end of the day, he was the face of turning this organization and franchise around ... it just made all the sense in the world to give him the deal we gave him. There was some consideration given to (his knees) – but as we looked at it and talked – we decided he has earned this. He has earned this max contract regardless of what problems might come along."
