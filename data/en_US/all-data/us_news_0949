ø14. Kris Draper (Detroit special assistant to GM Ken Holland): Count on him following the same path that Yzerman took. He'll study under Holland and Nill, learning how the Red Wings manage their cap and evaluate players. Anyone who knows Draper knows he will work at this. He is a born leader with four championship rings. It will take him some time, but he will be a GM candidate.

"I feel betrayed that those who had the authority in the church to stop Brendan Smyth failed to act on the evidence I gave them. However, I also accept that I was part of an unhelpful culture of deference and silence in society, and the church, which thankfully is now a thing of the past," Brady said.
Overall, this is delicious food. It doesn't come cheap, though. One night I took home dinner for two -- two entrees, an order of fries, a salad and one dessert. The check was $48.39, and I still had to wash the dishes. But the place buzzes.

And speaking of gentlemen, you're unlikely to meet a finer one than Jesse Thorn, born and bred in San Francisco and host of the splendid "Put This On" webisodes. On Tuesday, Season 1 of his and Adam Lisagor's terrific series of men's style videos about "dressing like a grown-up" comes out on DVD.

A:You like to pick a great comedy market, which Portland truly is. There are certain cities that are known to be great audience cities, and Portland is one of 'em. When you're doing a TV special, you don't want to do it in New York or L.A., because the audiences are too jaded.

For the last few years, the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences aided area law enforcement in solving property crimes by testing evidence for "touch DNA" - microscopic skin cells containing DNA that naturally rub off when an object, like a car steering wheel, is touched. The technology can be used even if the suspect is wearing gloves because there's a high likelihood the skin cells were transferred onto the gloves when the perpetrator was slipping them on.

Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage on Monday, and on Thursday the New Jersey Assembly approved a similar measure. Voters in those states will probably have the final say; opponents are organizing a petition drive for a Washington ballot measure to ban gay marriage, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has vowed to veto his state's marriage bill and present the issue as a referendum instead. There's no telling what voters in either state will decide, but such occasional shoals matter less than the overall direction of the tide, and we know which way that's turning.
County Executive Ed FitzGerald has since challenged the vote, accusing board members of usurping his authority to appointment members to the tax-supported agency and violating the agency's own bylaws.

These games down the stretch are meaningless in the standings, but they hold intrigue for players fighting for roster spots. Both Harris and Donald Sloan have non-guaranteed contracts for next season. Presumably each will participate in summer league for the Cavs and attend training camp, although the Cavs can go in different direction at any time.

A waiter administered the Heimlich maneuver. When that didn't work, a woman attending a Christmas party at the restaurant and a maintenance worker both gave him CPR.
The Club World Cup lacks the cachet of the UEFA Champions League. In the name of egalitarianism, the tournament features the club champions of FIFA's six confederations, plus a representative from the host nation. Until 2005, it was contested only by the champions from Europe and South America. Even now the gap between winners of the Champions League and the Copa Libertadores and the rest of the field is enormous, so folks really only take notice when the final rolls around.

Charlotte, like Portland, is hard-pressed to lure big-name free agents, so the draft is a logical way to build. The Bobcats have gotten a backcourt of the future by using lottery picks to get Gerald Henderson (No. 12, 2009) and D.J. Augustin (No. 9, 2008). But they've also taken lottery flops in Sean May (No. 13 pick in 2005) and Adam Morrison (No. 3 in 2006), neither of whom is in the NBA today.

Because cystic fibrosis is a rare disease -- it occurs in one of every 3,500 babies born in the U.S. each year -- the foundation gets no government funding, Klepinger said. Most of the Oregon chapter's proceeds come from fundraisers such as the annual Portland Firefighter Stairclimb, started by Carson and Brandon's grandfather, Wes Loucks, a retired firefighter.
What happened: Inspired by what might be Ben Wallace's last game for the Pistons and Ben Gordon's three-point rampage, the Pistons ended the season with a victory. The Pistons led the 76ers, 86-66, at the end of the third quarter, with Gordon and Rodney Stuckey making big baskets.

Carmona isn't in that stratosphere, unless you're talking about the proximity of his head to the clouds. He makes $6.1 million this year. The Indians have the first of three club options at $7 million next season. The best you can say for Carmona is that he's been durable and that his issues aren't injury-related (but soon could be, if he doesn't fix his delivery).
Whatever the amount, motorists will have the consolation of never having to slow for a tollbooth on the all-electronic highway.

"Smart People" is a comedy about people needing all their smarts, and then some, to escape from the holding pens of their own heads. It's a debut feature for its director, Noam Murro, a maker of landmark commercials on TV, and for its writer, Mark Poirier, the author of widely admired novels and short stories. The film, set in Pittsburgh, feels freshly discovered, rather than constructed, even though it centers on a Salingeresque family and the familiar figure of a blocked and lovelorn academic. (Just how familiar is reflected below, in the details of another fine film opening today.) A good deal of the freshness comes from a grand, clownish slob played by Thomas Haden Church -- he's actually the smartest person of the piece -- while Dennis Quaid occupies the center with a mastery that's all the more notable for its humanity, because Lawrence Wetherhold is one refractory nut to crack.
Quick ideas: Smoked paprika, made from smoke-dried, red peppers, adds smoky flavor. Other types of paprika add less earthy flavor and vary flavors in savory dishes.

In 1987, Danson had helped create the American Oceans Campaign, now known as Oceana, and Addis threw himself into working with the group. Now the world's largest international ocean-conservation organization, Oceana fights against overfishing and pollution and promotes legislation that protects marine animals. It's become the passion project of Addis, who serves as president of the board, while Danson is a board member and a most earnest advocate.

A famous line by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry sums up the mandate for Windows Phone and its apps: "A designer knows he has achieved perfection when there is nothing left to add, but nothing left to take away." Windows Phone strives to reduce a screen to just the barest essentials of information and interface. It doesn't even display the status bar that's been a visual staple in phones since the screens were LCD. Not unless you need to see it (because your battery is dying) or you want to see it (just swipe down from the top of the screen).

If McClintock wins, his quest for construction of an Auburn Dam would face steep odds that would be even higher after a revocation of water rights.

But what has distinguished the company in recent years is its forays into challenging, and commercially tricky, territory. In shows such as “Gossamer,” adapted by Newberry Award winner Lois Lowry from her own novel, and the recent “Locomotion,” OCT has addressed issues including domestic abuse, the death of parents, and the challenges of foster care — and done so with sensitivity and thoughtfulness.

He came into office last year armed for fights, making enemies.

"My moan is about the Ohio Lottery's Classic Lotto. It's a cash cow. The jackpot is now $44.3 million. The initial jackpot was $1 million. The drawing is on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. This drawing goes up based on sales, but it is guaranteed to be at least $1 million. Nobody has won this jackpot in months. They haven't made a big deal about it or anything. Why? Because they are enjoying the money they are drawing in on it. I played for at least three months and then gave it up because I never even won a dollar on it. I know it's the lottery, but it just seems like they are totally milking this game."

Less hyped, but no less intriguing, is "Two Lovers," a romantic drama that would have relatively little interest if it weren't for the fact that Joaquin "I Used to Be Semi-Sane" Phoenix plays the male corner of the romantic triangle.

Enterprise defends those provisions. The company says that it would rent a recalled vehicle "to avoid turning away customers who show up at their locations when their desired vehicle is subject to a recall which the manufacturer deems appropriate for disclosure rather than grounding."

In such cases, she wrote, "a disclosure served the same purpose as the chime itself."

We live in the personalization era. Everything - from kitchen appliances to cars - can be had in vast array of colors, sizes and options to fit each person's needs and desires. It's gotten to the point where if I go to a website and it doesn't offer to customize itself to fit my every whim, I feel ripped off. Science tells us we will soon be able to order custom babies: we'll choose hair color, height and how fast they'll be able to run before they are even conceived.
Ronnie Magro, the resident musclehead of "Jersey Shore," faces aggravated assault charges after getting into a fight during the filming of the show last summer.

Surprisingly, Mustonen displayed even greater strengths in Sibelius’ Symphony No. 6. Compared by the composer to the scent of the first snow, the music ranges from broad and arching to incisive and energetic, evoking both vast expanses of white hills shimmering in daylight, and a sense of intrepid winter activity. Mustonen brought clarity of texture and flawlessly insightful phrasing to the engaged, colorful and emotive playing of the orchestra.

The look, often referred to as "the bold lip," requires a change for women accustomed to wearing different lipstick colors depending on the occasion. The trend makes lipstick a consistent focal point, even with casual wear. One of the earliest places it appeared was in J. Crew catalogs, which have been showing the look for a while. It dominated this month's catalog where fresh-faced models in slim pencil skirts and faded skinny jeans wore hard-to-miss orangy-red lipstick. "There's something incredibly modern about clean skin, pulled back hair and a strong lip," says James Boehmer, director of global artistry for NARS Cosmetics.

The attached database contains some 1,126 names, although not all 28 local districts have responded as yet to the Register's request. Some districts list more individuals than their anticipated full-time loss figures because, in some cases, individuals work only part time.

“When it gets to the playoffs, this is a guy that takes off,” Flyers coach Peter Laviolette said. “We were just talking about it in the office, to put up the amount of points that he has in the playoffs speaks volumes to him as a player because playoffs are why we’re here and that’s what matters. He’s a guy that’s consistently gotten it done, not this year, two years or in his career; he does it game after game. I think everybody expects that from him.”

Winfield's success at the combine and increased attention from college coaches has fueled him to work even harder. He said he is training four times a week.
That was the only argument people were trying to make to Greg Schiano throughout the past month. It’s not that Nova shouldn’t play. Of course he’s more physically gifted — everyone knows that. Of course he’s the future, though there’s really no way to rationalize nine turnovers in three games, which basically prevented the present from being every bit as gratifying as that future.

A similar confusion about the roles of the courts and Congress played out on the third day of arguments, when the justices heard arguments on the question of what parts of the law (if any) would survive if the individual mandate is ruled unconstitutional. The plaintiffs in the case argue that if the mandate goes, so must the entire law. The Obama administration contends that only the requirement that insurance companies not deny coverage because of pre-existing conditions and that they not charge higher premiums to those who are sick would need to go if the mandate is struck down. And a third-party lawyer argued that the mandate could be severed from the rest of the bill.

Demoff: "I think when you change coaches in any sport, everybody expects you to do the opposite of what you did before. ... I think one of the things that we have to do is not shy away from what's happened in the past three years, analyze what was good and what was bad. I don't think one of the reasons we failed to have success was that Steve Spagnuolo wasn't a head coach before. He was attentive to details, a great leader, had a great rapport with players. You can look at someone who had experience before but it's not going to be automatic that we're going to look for the polar opposite of what we started with."

As an evangelical Christian theologian and a Zen Buddhist priest, we ask religious leaders and politicians to weigh carefully their rhetorically charged claims in this most political of seasons.

That the movie remains watchable is a credit to Collins' clever conceit, which neatly jumbles together ancient Roman gladiator contests, "Lord of the Flies," the Richard Bachman/ Stephen King novella "The Running Man," and modern reality TV. Props, too, to Lawrence, whose mixture of unfussy physicality and soft-spoken rage give the movie the backbone it's otherwise lacking. She acts circles around Hutcherson and Hemsworth, and steadily hints at something forward-thinking and exciting: a teenage franchise heroine whom the boys can't possibly keep up with.

Crucially, this legislation would enable the city to act on a fundamental truth: That growth  not reckless budget slashing  is the key to overcoming a fiscal crisis. If the city is forced to address the current crisis by cutting police officers and vital infrastructure projects, crime will rise and more businesses will flee.

"This incident underscores the 21st-century bully, equipped with a cell phone and a Facebook account, is a constant source of torment for our kids. There is no walking away.

Two studies published Monday by the same researchers whose work formed the basis for the task force recommendations found that women 40-49 with a mother or sister who had breast cancer or who had very dense breasts were twice as likely to get the disease. Thus for these women, the benefits of a mammogram balance out the possible harm, the researchers said, and they are good candidates for screening.
Mattingly acknowledged there are questions about the Dodgers' offense after the club struggled to produce runs last season. At the start of camp, Kemp predicted he'd be the first player in major league history to hit 50 homers and steal 50 bases.
"I know who you are," Waring says, and then the terms are disclosed: He's being pursued by the mob, but he's not sure why. That's a hot tip, and Waring wants to make him her informant, but he demurs then, and he keeps demurring as the body count rises, with the first guy ordering the hit getting a taste of his killing medicine, and then so many more. There's a wonderful set piece in which the Boy infiltrates a Phoenix compound doubling as the National Mafiosi Convention, Topic A being all about him. I won't give it away, but what happens—and how the Boy extricates himself from the situation—is straight out of the Richard Stark playbook, especially some of the most vivid scenes in one of the best Parker novels, "Slayground."

What "Ben Hur" did for Circus Maximus, "Gladiator" did for the Colosseum. The computer-generated world brings to life the famous ruin in a literally glittering arena of blood and triumph. Russell Crowe stars, but I loved watching Joaquin Phoenix chew the scenery as the mad emperor Commodus, who ended the string of "good emperors" that had kept Rome rich and safe for 200 years.
Sports equipment
The veteran point guard, No. 13 in case anyone forgot, looked sharp at her first preseason practice in the last 30 minutes -- that's all the media is permitted to watch. Except, ugh, maybe on that no-look pass a new teammate of hers didn't anticipate.
"I ran on lower taxes, thrifty government," he said. "If we don’t get spending under control, we’re going to be in a very difficult situation."

Union leaders suggested the bills would destroy much of the good services residents have come to expect by pushing experienced workers into retirement and dissuading talented people from choosing government careers. They said children would suffer if experienced educators are not in place to implement new federal requirements, and that it would be more difficult to solve crimes if experienced prosecutors leave for private practice.
The lesson, which ought to be underscored, is that relatively modest amounts of private money, applied wisely, can vastly enhance the power of public agencies to raise the level of design when it comes to public infrastructure.

The Timbers' defense played well for the first 75 minutes, holding the Fire without a goal -- Chicago's first goal was an own-goal by the Timbers -- and shutting down Chicago forwards Diego and Gaston Puerari. However, with a 3-0 lead, the Timbers got lazy on defense.
U.S. foreign policy is the most important influence on international relations on the world stage. Shouldn’t our graduates be able to identify the countries of the Middle East, explain why the India-Pakistan border is perhaps the most dangerous on Earth, reflect on the significance of World War II or describe the political significance of statesmen such as FDR and Reagan? Shouldn’t a well-rounded high school graduate know what jazz and Impressionism are?
When test questions are easier, more correct answers can be required to pass. When test questions are harder, fewer correct answers can meet the passing bar.
Other details are hazier than they should be. Corinne seems to go from high-schooler to thirty-something mother overnight (complete with an eccentric, best-friend character out of nowhere). Money, bills, work — none of these are ever mentioned. (At one point Corinne is living on her own, driving a new car — does she suddenly have a job?)
At 6-6 and 220 pounds, Evans is strong and long. He isn't as athletic or as shifty as Wade is, but he's bigger and just as willful in getting to the basket, no matter who is defending him. As he observes the way defenses treat him and react to his moves -- always monitoring where he should pass -- he makes the right decision most of the time, which is remarkable for a rookie.

Pastner, by the way, boxed himself into a corner postgame. He said his players didn't lose the game, he did. Losses fall on the coach. But when asked what he as a coach could have done differently, he said not much. "You have some open shots you have to make," he said.
"He needs to be more kind, more gentle and sweet."

How could the creators not anticipate the nasty responses, even the tender tweens uploading videos in violation of YouTube's 13-and-older policy? Their directness, playful but steadfast, grips even those accustomed to life's open Internet channel, where revolutions and executions play out alongside the ramblings of anybody with digital access.
The sunroof on my 1998 Toyota RAV4 doesn't close anymore. The Toyota repair guy says it will cost $1,700 to replace the motor and cables ($1,400 for parts, $300 labor). The blue-book value for my car appears to be about $3,500, which means I'll be investing about half its value in a repair. However, I love my RAV4, and it has only 42,000 miles on it. Leaving the sunroof unrepaired or closed isn't an option - I live in San Francisco, and unless there's an absolute downpour, I have the roof open. Should I get it fixed, or get a whole new car? Thanks so much for your help. - Laura
"I wasn't worried because that's kind the way we play," Dwiggins said. "We were on fire last night (in a 67-47 semifinal win over Gibault) and that was not our normal team. In a lot of games, we get off to a slow start."

Spring and Fall: To a Young Child
Hence, the Republican two-primary bill, which Kasich signed Oct. 21. That measure buys Republicans time to try to craft a compromise redistricting bill with Democrats. The initial GOP plan to woo black Democrats to back a referendum-proof map seemingly failed.
The physician may be focused on only one or two aspects of a patient's medical condition and not consider themselves involved in the "big picture." The doctor may not want to appear "negative" by bringing up an unpopular subject. He or she may view having such discussions as an admission of "failure." (It is sad, but still true sometimes.)

Councilwoman JoAnn Watson lamented before the interviews that of five people named to the financial advisory board by Gov. Rick Snyder, Mayor Dave Bing and state Treasurer Andy Dillon, none is a Detroiter.

That agreement avoided appointment of an emergency manager but gave the state significant power over the city's finances.

Fourth, there are some useful buying-versus-renting calculators on the web. Some show buyers exactly how many years it will take for them to be better off owning versus renting. But most allow users to put in independent values for the inflation rate and the rate at which house prices increase. If you set inflation to 2% and house price growth to 6%, just about anything looks like a good deal. The prudent thing is to use the same rate for both. Again, use the difference between the 10-year TIPS yield and the 10-year regular Treasury yield, which works out to 2.2% at the moment.

The details: Megan and Ryan Glaab, husband-and-wife and winemaking partners, decided to settle a difference of opinion on a parcel of Vermentino by crafting two wines. She wanted to depict the freshness of Italy's coastal versions of this grape; he wanted to pay tribute to Italian skin-fermented whites. The solution: partner wines that prove both were right. The 2010 Ryme Cellars His/Hers Las Brisas Vineyard Carneros Vermentino (each $32, 14.2%/13.8%) brilliantly show two sides of the grape: His is full of pine pitch and dried apricot; hers brims with sea salt and fresh guava. The results will have wine-obsessed couples arguing into the wee hours.

Shahram Salek-Ardakani, a former postdoc who recently took at faculty position at the University of Florida, said he liked LJI, in part, because, "You have PIs (principal investigators) who are at the top of their field. There is a lot of collaboration between the labs – that's what I most got out of the Institute, the ability to work with people with many different areas of immunology expertise – autoimmunity, allergies, infection, vaccine development. I participated in numerous projects and learned a lot in terms of cutting-edge science, management, everything I needed to become an independent PI."
