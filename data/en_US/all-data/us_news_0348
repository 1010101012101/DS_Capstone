"Detailed floor plans automatically appear when you’re viewing the map and zoomed in on a building where indoor map data is available," writes Google engineering VP Brian McClendon. "The familiar “blue dot” icon indicates your location within several meters, and when you move up or down a level in a building with multiple floors, the interface will automatically update to display which floor you’re on. All this is achieved by using an approach similar to that of ‘My Location’ for outdoor spaces, but fine tuned for indoors."
The slide, of course, has been historically bad. On Sunday, the Royals equaled the 1995 Marlins and 1940 White Sox by losing their first nine home games. On Monday, they matched the 1913 Yankees  the first year they were called the Yankees  as the only teams to lose their first 10 home games before tying the Boston Red Sox. The Yankees then lost seven more home games and didn't win their first home game until June 7.

The most important tool of a police dog is its nose, and Ambrose found out Ike didn't want to use his sniffer while getting sprayed with a garden hose. Through several months of training, Ike overcame that obstacle.
One of the main reasons for zeroing in on a particular toilet seat riser is the height. Elevated toilet seats can add from two to six inches to the toilet, making it easier on one's knees to get on and off. In order to find the comfortable height, cushions can be placed on a chair until the desired position is reached. The riser height is then calculated by subtracting the toilet seat height from the height of the cushioned chair.

Rutgers athletic director Tim Pernetti declined comment on the addition of Temple, referring questions to the league office.
The results so far are modest. A dozen or so parent groups have formed throughout the state to consider reforms, and only a couple of those are interested in abandoning their traditional public schools for charters. Some merely want a new principal; others seek to make it easier to get rid of teachers who consistently let their students down. Some yearn for basic, common-sense services such as regular communication from teachers. Not all of the groups are at schools that even qualify for parent trigger petitions — the schools have to be failing on a couple of fronts — but they nonetheless hope that an organized parent effort can strengthen their children's education.

Soon we sighted a rare spot of dry land, which like so much dry land in these mangroves is the result of castoff oyster shells, the after-dinner detritus of thousands of years of settlement by Calusa Indians. We pulled over for a stretch and found, just inshore, the foundation of a 19th-century settler's homestead camouflaged by the dappled sunlight. We ate sandwiches, then headed on.

NHL.com: "The Blues aren't going to throw out forwards with eye-popping numbers. None of them are among the League leaders in any offensive categories, but all are effective and used in many different situations. Captain David Backes led the team in goals and points, and also should get plenty of consideration for the Selke Trophy. T.J. Oshie, Andy McDonald, Alexander Steen and David Perron round out a cast that is consistent across the board. The Blues are balanced, which has been a primary weapon of attack on a game-by-game basis. They will be tough to defend for any team in the postseason. If McDonald and Steen find that extra gear that make them dangerous off the rush, it opens the ice for players like Perron and Oshie."

The Couch-Brown lawsuit also asserts a class action that seeks "medical monitoring" of players who aren't yet experiencing health consequences, but who suffered concussions during their playing days.

Another woman from Texas was about to get a double mastectomy when her insurance company canceled her policy because she forgot to declare a case of acne.

47) Why do your baggage tags say MCI instead of KCI? MCI = Mid-Continent International, the airport's name in the planning stages. When it opened in 1972, it was Kansas City International Airport.

Americans consistently rank retirement planning among their most important financial goals and for good reason. Many people aren't saving enough to provide for a comfortable lifestyle in retirement, even with Social Security benefits.

Workers at Ecovative inoculate mycelium into pasteurized bits of seed husks or plant stalks, then place the mix into clear plastic molds shaped like the desired packaging pieces, such as a cradle-shaped mold for a wine bottle. The mix is covered for about five days as millions of mycelium strands grow around and through the feedstock, acting as a kind of glue. The piece is heat dried to kill the fungus, insuring that mushrooms can't sprout from it. Since the mycelium is cloned, the product does not include spores, which can trigger allergies. The packaging is edible, technically, though it does not appear appetizing and is not recommended as a snack.

With smoky cocktails and table-side preparation of hot buttered rum and flaming absinthe, it's not hard to see why Monterey's acclaimed Restaurant 1833 has set the scene on fire. It also doesn't hurt that chief bartender Michael Lay's list of $10 mixed drinks — with some whimsical choices like the Kentucky Waffle (10-year bourbon, lemon, maple syrup, apple cider and cinnamon stick) and signature barrel-aged cocktails — is lengthy, as are the menus for Tequila, bourbon, scotch and absinthe.

I find Detroit's future pretty awful due to the Ben Gordon and Charlie Villanueva deals. They are both barely playable but were given monster contracts in the summer of 2009.

Smith, the president of Speedway Motorsports Inc. that owns seven other tracks, should have known better. The lack of planning and preparation is unfathomable, given Smith's expertise. The sellout crowd of 107,000 certainly deserved better.

November has become Beaujolais time, largely due to always-contentious Beaujolais Nouveau being released on the third Thursday (yesterday). If the light, fruity, simple flavors of Nouveau certainly don't harm the holiday meal, they don't much help it either.

Staton: "Right. You look at various types of property, you may what to look in a different location from where you're at.

That ugly, this-candidate-is-up-one-day-and-down-the-next GOP nominating war is one reason for optimism among liberals. The Republican contenders have bloodied each other, dominated the headlines with what at times seems like mutually assured-destruction tactics and damaged public perceptions of them.

The petition is, of course, a stunt; as badly as California has mismanaged its prisons, there are state and federal avenues for addressing such problems. But that doesn't mean the activists' concerns should be dismissed. There is reason to suspect that in the name of fighting gang violence, corrections officials have exposed some prisoners to conditions that are extraordinarily harsh, unfair and possibly unconstitutional.

Then there's exercise, which often works like a wonder drug for fibromyalgia. Yoga, tai chi, aquatics in a heated pool, heck, even Nordic walking (hoofing it with poles) all have helped people feel and function better. In one study, doing water workouts just twice a week meant not only fewer ouches but a better quality of life. We also have watched patients with this condition find benefits from vitamin D-3 (1,000 IU a day), D-ribose (500 milligrams three times a day), DHA (900 milligrams a day) and massage.
Scoring has been an issue, too. The Wings have just nine regulation goals in their last six gamesThe third and fourth line guys who were so brilliant earlier in the season havent provided nearly the same lift of late. Theres a nice bit of history attached to the last time the Wings met the Predators: It was in 08, also in the first round. The Wings took that series in six games, and then rolled on all the way to claim the Stanley Cup. The NHL is a different league today, with parity that denies any team being considered a championship front-runner. Can it happen to the Wings? Its up to them. Questions loom as they embark on the playoffs, but in scoring two third-period goals to get one point out of the Chicago game, the Wings took an important first step.

Series history: The Blazers have won the last two meetings against Utah after dropping the first matchup this season. One of them, on Dec. 27, was a rare win in Utah — just the Blazers' second over the last seven seasons.

This is never more clear than when the Oscars -- in one of their periodic, fruitless quests to appeal to a younger audience --try to shake things up.

While Bombardier said it would use 66 percent domestic materials, Alstom committed to using 95 percent.
It’s unclear exactly where the Giants envision the 6-2, 242-pound Rivers playing. He’s been a weak-side linebacker for his entire career and the team currently has Michael Boley to play that spot with Mathias Kiwanuka on the strong side. Jerry Reese recently mentioned Boley as one of the candidates to compete for the opening in the middle. It's possible the Giants believe Rivers can move inside as well.

On one visit I had an appetizer sampler ($9.99) of fried wontons, spring rolls and lettuce cups and none of it made my heart sing (also, several desserts are like sweet-salty coconut milk soups that didn't totally add up for me). Instead of these, I'd go for the curries and stir- fries, many dishes arriving with little ramekins of spicy peanut sauce or Sriracha (quickly replacing ketchup as America's favorite condiment). Imagine it: Green peas, sweet basil and chicken, all frolicking in a bath of red Thai curry, Mexican mole and coconut milk ($10.99). Spicy panang mole at Nitally's is a winning international collaboration.

The Eagles picked Arizona quarterback Nick Foles, a transfer from MSU, with the 88th overall pick. The 6-foot-5, 243-pound Foles could compete with Mike Kafka and veteran Trent Edwards for the backup job behind Michael Vick.
Kuechly definitely should be a consideration for the Bears if he is on the board at 19. I have my doubts he will be, though. Kuechly could step in immediately and contribute as a strong side linebacker and be the eventual successor to Urlacher when Urlacher retires or moves on. Kuechly is an athletic, instinctive backer who would be a perfect fit in Lovie Smith's defense. I think he's going to be a Pro Bowl caliber player in the NFL for a long time.

Though the outlook for pickup sales is a bit muddy because of the unsettled housing market, it is a somewhat clearer for commercial trucks.
Finally, the ad criticizes Romney for proposing a new approach to corporate income taxes, one that looks at profits made just in the United States. Such a "territorial" approach happens to be the one used in almost every other developed country. Today the United States taxes multinational companies on all the profits they make globally, but does not collect the tax on foreign earnings until they are brought back into the United States. This system may discourage companies from putting assets and jobs in low-tax foreign lands simply for the sake of cutting their tax bills, but it isn't an effective deterrent. Instead, it makes it harder for companies to take the profits they make in expanding foreign markets and reinvest them in their U.S. operations.

Before Game 1, Portland's Ty Rattie had said how the Toyota Center is one of his least favorite rinks to play, in part because the fans are so boisterous.

Westfeldt (in her first stint in the director's chair after writing/producing "Kissing Jessica Stein" and "Ira & Abby") gives her actors the room to reveal plenty about their characters in a way that's subtle, even when the movie is crude.

"We've seen a big drop in the jobs we have available, just because that's how the economy is in our state," Bristow said. "People are truly very concerned about what the future is going to look like, and just willing to do anything to get back into the job market."
• Jim Lambright's challenge to Huskies: Get aggressive on defense -- Jerry Brewer, Seattle Times: Get into a deep discussion with Lambright about defense, and he offers an intelligent and nuanced perspective. These are difficult times to rebuild a defense because offenses have discovered fresh methods to gain an advantage. But Lambright says that, historically, offenses always find new ways to get ahead of defenses, but defenses eventually catch up. He expects defenses to evolve soon and become better at stopping spread and no-huddle attacks that keep defenses from being able to react properly and disguise coverages effectively.

David Frisk, whose biography of Rusher will be published this year, said the conservative leader was an optimist who took setbacks to the movement in stride. He was resigned to the election of President Obama in 2008 and unsurprised by the Republican gains last year because, Frisk said, "he knew politics runs in cycles. You're never up forever or down forever. He believed conservatism would come back."

Though its overall tone is charming, the film has been able to work disturbing peril into its scenario, both from the natural world — a fierce crow is determined to eat Arrietty at all costs — and, more intriguingly, from humans, who by virtue of their size create chaos for the borrowers without even meaning to.

It was the sense that Wooden understood something essential about character, not just basketball.

There is no "bling," no trash talk or intimidation or boastfulness on Wooden's pyramid.

Supply is not the cause of high gas prices; refining capacity is the driver. The Canadian oil sands and the Bakken oil shale deposits in the Dakotas are nothing new to the oil companies — it’s just that the cost and effort to get the oil is expensive, and it is easier to get oil from liquid reserves. It costs about $40-$50 per barrel to extract this oil, so the per-barrel price needs to stay high, as it is now, for oil companies to make a profit.

Ask the radical Islamic cleric Abu Qatada if he thinks the war against the West, which is the proper way of framing this conflict, is over. British Home Secretary Theresa May has possibly blown an opportunity to deport Mr. Qatada because of a bureaucratic snafu over a deadline for his appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.

Q: My husband and I got divorced about one year ago. Neither one of us remarried and there were not other people involved in our lives. My 5-year-old daughter lived with him so she could attend the same elementary school as her friends. All of a sudden he died recently.

She is in kindergarten and misses her dad. Is there a proper time for this?

The last time I stopped for supper at Don Dae Gam, a waiter brought everybody in the restaurant free plates of broiled small intestine. That's just the way they roll there.

The olive-feta plate is something I would order every day of the week. Pitted kalamata olives dotted with gooey, mozzarella-like feta filled out a surprisingly generous order.

I couldn't quite tell, but it gave them an unexpected injection of sweetness.

Justice Pfeifer goes on to argue for life without parole. What he doesn't mention is that no one can be sure that life without parole really means what it says. What the legislature does today, it can undo tomorrow. There is nothing to prevent the legislature from passing a bill abolishing life without parole and effectively reducing all the penalties to something much less. And, of course, there is always the governor's power to commute sentences. One stroke of the pen could lower the sentence or even set the prisoner free. There is only one way to guarantee that a prisoner will never be released.

We're remind that Jalel & Kym were in the bottom two last week and had to do the "dance duel."

New outfits for the Temptations because they're really male divas and they're singing "Ain't Too Proud to Beg," another Desert Island Jukebox selection. Jaleel busts out a full-on split, which is completely appropriate for tonight's theme. I'm loving Jaleeel's leg movements and lightness on his feet tonight - everything, to me, looks so precise and sharp , but with a fun 60s wiggle. Still needs to work on the hands/arms, though. Len says Jaleel "is back" after the lull since his early promise. Bruno's excited and also talking comeback. Carrie Ann says he brought his A-game.

"It took a while to get, operationally, an understanding of how the vehicle worked, for a couple of reasons," Free explained. "It's very complicated, with a million different parts.
