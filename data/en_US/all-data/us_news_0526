Given that Californians voted 2-to-1 against higher taxes last year, that means more spending cuts. Start with the obvious stuff that should have happened years ago: Eliminate 88 boards and commissions. Consolidate government bureaucracies, as suggested in Gov.

In a community college class I taught a year ago, I took another sampling of things I hoped young adults might know. I asked students to name an American poet. Few could, though one wrote "Shakspeer." I asked them to name any battle of the Civil War. Few could. I asked them to name a famous Native American. Few could. One student thought the Great Depression took place in the 1960s. Another thought John McCain had led American forces in the Revolutionary War. Almost none knew what happened on D-Day, and one student thought Louis Armstrong was famous for landing on the moon. There were 35 questions on my quiz: ("What happened at Auschwitz? What happened at Hiroshima? What post was held by Newt Gingrich, John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi? From what country did we gain our independence? What Cabinet post does Hillary Clinton currently hold?).
This is what happens when you put a guy like Billy Bragg, a band like Wilco and a stack of lyrics left behind by Woody Guthrie in a room together and expect great things to happen. Great things happen. "California Stars" remains a welcome staple of the Wilco live show. In addition to the first two "Mermaid Avenue" releases, which were classic, this collection adds a third CD of outtakes and a documentary called "Man in the Sand." If the CD of outtakes is a spottier affair than the original releases, that's to be expected, right? But plenty of obvious highlights emerge. The haunting "When the Roses Bloom Again" and melancholy power-pop of "Listening to the Wind That Blows" are Wilco gold. The porchfront blues of "Gotta Work" sounds like an outtake from an Alan Lomax field recording. And the banjo-driven "Chain of Broken Hearts" could start another folk revival.

Health-care employees, figuring their jobs were on the chopping block, started leaving in droves. Corrections spent $5.3 million less on full-time health-care staff salaries this past fiscal year than two years earlier, a 13.5 percent drop.

Ryan said the department eventually found other providers.

I take responsibility and am responsible I told him for the things that I said, the things that I talked about doing, the political talk about how to raise campaign funds, the things that we believed were political horse trades and legal. I take responsibility for saying those things, and as I told the judge back in December, everything I talked about doing when it came to campaign fund-raising and political horse trading, I believed was on the right side of the law. The decision went against me. I am responsible for the things that I said. I accept that decision as hard as it is.

Like a lot of movies (and people) that go bad, the film is best at the beginning.

Chiyo experiences only one fleeting moment of kindness, when a handsome stranger, known as the Chairman (Ken Watanabe), sees her on the street and buys the little girl a flavored ice. If Hatsumomo is the equivalent of a wicked stepsister, the Chairman is the handsome prince, and Chiyo resolves to grow up to become a geisha and have the Chairman as her danna (patron/sugar daddy).

Fortunately, two innings later with the score still 3-3, the Giants had the chance to out-detail Milwaukee. Buster Posey led off the bottom of the 11th with a single and was replaced by pinch runner Emmanuel Burriss. Pagan then came up with a very intelligent idea. He decided to try and bunt for a hit, even though he's got decent power and was batting fifth in the order.

In a strategic shift in the late 1990s, Baltimore decided to de-emphasize containerized cargo to pursue autos, agricultural and construction machines, and niche cargoes, a strategy that has paid off handsomely over the past decades.

That shackle-busting is reflected in Ryan's "Cocktails for Thinking" menu, which features such libations as the Stockyards, made with a cinnamon-driven reposado tequila, Madeira, maraschino liqueur and Peychaud's bitters — basically booze on top of booze.

"Higher gas prices are just something that real estate agents have to absorb into our day-to-day expenses. We do not take price increases as the industry standard commission rate has held steady for years. However in a market with falling prices, we are actually taking price decreases as we are earning less net commissions due to lower sales prices. This is another example of how this market is creating more efficiencies for agents. Most of us have a set marketing/expense budget and when gas prices rise, decisions have to be made on how to allocate our budget. Less productive marketing expenses or other expense that do not have a good return on investment are reduced or eliminated. That is actually healthy for our long-term business. With that being said, lower fuel prices or alternate energy sources will be welcomed by the real estate agent community."

As a teenager, he sang and performed in support of the Mighty Clouds Of Joy, Shirley Caesar, and other prominent gospel artists.

They arrived at the Pit Stop in first place, again, for the fifth time.

The film deliberately provides a clearcut fate for only one of the characters, leaving the rest to return for however many more sequels the filmmakers can turn out. And perhaps that’s the real curse of the Black Pearl. No matter how many times it sinks to the bottom, it’s always there, waiting to be salvaged for one last leaky voyage.

The board voted 7-2 to cut the planned 3.6 percent tuition hike for in-state undergraduates in half after a long debate at a three-hour meeting in New Brunswick.
Did I mention the earth is an amazing place? Belize affirmed that deduction. The people, the customs, the landscape, the natural resources and the milieu all testified to the grandeur of the planet upon which I live. Scripture affirms that God created the earth with inestimable precision, immeasurable possibility, infinite beauty and vast bounty. I can know the Almighty Creator a little more accurately when I behold his works, and I can challenge my own finite creaturely status when I embrace his handiwork. "The world the way Patti lives it" has been broadened once again.

Many of the same preparations are brought to bear on lamb, beef and seafood: tikka masala, saag (that's the forest-green chopped spinach sauce) and rogan josh (a kind of brown, mild curry heady with cardamom rogan is Persian for clarified butter, josh means passionate). Our hands-down favorite was a lamb vindaloo ($12.99), not fiery, but with oomph. This version had a little tart kick that might have been tamarind pulp and a little cider vinegar. Scoop it onto rice and adorn it on all sides with condiments like a cilantro-mint chutney or salty-spicy achaar (classic Indian pickled veggies marinated in citrus and chile) or a sweet mango chutney. A dab of this, a bite of that and you hit all the taste notes of the classic six "rasas": sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent.
Compromise is essential to remedying this dangerous tilt toward fiscal decline. Bringing down the deficit centers on spending cuts and, in its euphemistic parlance, revenue enhancement. Simply put, tax increases must be part of the equation.
The Morses were deeply involved with it for the rest of their lives. Reynolds Morse died in 2000; Eleanor Morse died July 1. She had been part of the early planning stages for a new museum building, but by the time ground was broken for it in 2008, she had become ill and probably was never able to appreciate its full scope.

Not only did we ditch the English-speaking crowd, we encountered a refreshing alternative – Argentines on vacation during Holy Week.

On judging others based on appearances - There was a time when I would chuckle at seeing something like a Christmas tree in a picture window in April. After a few crises, and some very dark times, I can easily understand how that can happen, that on some days it's hard to find the energy to even brush your teeth. Instead of commenting on others' "odd" behavior, I try to ask myself if I would be doing any better if I had lived their life experiences. - Humbler in Pittsburgh

Those electoral defeats, along with the statewide budget crunch, have put a squeeze on the Parks Department, which has been forced to cancel programs because of low staffing levels and shut down facilities for lack of maintenance. As San Mateo County prepares its budget this spring, a new task force will explore how to keep the underfunded parks agency running and whether its ambitions need to be scaled back.
In recent years, neuroscientists have documented how these mistakes happen. It turns out that the act of summoning the past to the surface actually changes the memory itself. Although we've long imagined our memories as a stable form of information, a data file writ into the circuits of the brain, that persistence is an illusion. In reality, our recollections are always being altered, the details of the past warped by our present feelings and knowledge. The more you remember an event, the less reliable that memory becomes.

Six years ago, I did a few ride-alongs with the Gladstone police because I wanted a better understanding of their job. I used the opportunity to ask questions. I asked one officer during a ride-along if he had ever pulled anyone over for suspicious driving.

I never got an explanation for "suspicious driving."

Gallagher also is trying to heighten growers' and investors' interest in seashore mallow by proving its versatility. The pulpy meal that's left after oil extraction could be processed into animal feed. Its stems could be a source of ethanol, or turned into pellets and burned like wood chips.

A toilet paper tube is slightly larger than the official toy testing tube, but it's a good home substitute, according to Nancy Cowles, executive director of Kids In Danger. In addition, keep older kids' toys out of reach of younger sibs.

This may have been for my benefit, knowing that I was a journalist, but it was striking.

Bagley said the Vikings would oppose such a move, saying that the team had spent months negotiating an agreement with state officials that obligated the Vikings to a $427 million stadium contribution.

Aside from several backpacking hikes, I have worked 160 two-week river trips down the Colorado in the canyon. During these trips I hiked about 25-35 plus miles on about 50 discretionary side-hikes we offer, varying in length from a few hundred yards to 18 miles each.

I average only two or three of these river trips a years lately but averaged four or five per year over most of the past 38 years. During my "biggest" year I worked 12 canyon trips for OARS Inc. and for the National Park Service as a ranger.

In discussions about the New Testament, "the Atonement" is generally understood to refer to the work of Jesus in putting right the human situation in relation to God. Throughout the course of Christian history this has been associated above all with the death of Jesus. ... However, it should also be noted that the saving work of Christ is just as often associated with the resurrection....One should therefore be wary of restricting New Testament views about the atoning work of Christ to discussions of the meaning of Jesus' death alone.
