“When you strangle somebody, it’s personal,” said Assistant Prosecutor Pinkey Carr, who addressed the jury last on behalf of the state. And Sowell, she said, “liked to choke a girl.”
The obvious goal is intimidation: to persuade perpetrators that their crimes will be punished and that repeated offenses will result in escalating sanctions. The slightly hidden agenda is to appear sufficiently vigilant to keep prosecutors in their place; to handle problems in-house rather than risk the caprices of a courtroom; to adopt the accident-scene conceit: "Nothing to see here, folks; keep moving."

Then, he was perfectly content on using it to capture all the little moments in life — Steve’s first pony ride and haircut. There was no greater joy than standing seven stories atop the chemistry building at The Haverford (Pa.) School, rain or shine, and developing a story around Steve’s grade school football games. (Last year, the field at Haverford was named for Ed Sabol.)

The scandal is hugely embarrassing for the agency. Whether the misconduct actually represents a security breach is not yet clear, but it's certainly a distinct possibility given that the agents probably preferred to keep their behavior a secret and therefore might have been susceptible to blackmail or other coercion. Or they might simply have blathered about security arrangements to the wrong people, the kind of tender trap the KGB used effectively during the Cold War years.

Still, looking ahead as she cradled Melinda's 3-month-old daughter Abigail, Linda Barbaglia is fairly sure the second generation of Barbaglias to run C&B Fork Lift Truck Service will be the last.
A handful of companies make it a point of paying for the boss to get a more thorough physical than rank-and-filers would get for a $20 co-pay. The logic, as Con-Way put it, is that "healthy executives are vital to the company's success." To that end, Applied Materials picked up an undisclosed bill to have Michael Splinter don a hospital gown; Intersil will pay up to $2,000 annually; and a couple of senior execs at LSI Logic were reimbursed about $1,500 even though the CEO didn't get a cent.

Sissinghurst, Adam realized in 2004 after his father's death, "had become something like a Titian in a car park," he wrote in his book. "It seemed as if the country was over. It had become a bogus version of itself." It wasn't a farm anymore, he wrote; it "wasn't even a place anymore: just a beautifully maintained garden dropped between a café and a shop."

But how do you explain the Cubs? What possesses people to stay so enamored of a team that seems cursed - literally, by some accounts - to lose every year? A Chicago buddy of mine once described the typical Cub fan as "70 percent optimism and 30 percent scar tissue." The Cubs are an unrequited love, but the Cardinals have rarely been a harsh mistress. Well, there was that painful stretch in the late '70s.

The Marlins, an expansion team in 1993, have won two World Series titles, but both came while playing at a football stadium, home to the Dolphins. Emblems of the 1997 and 2003 titles will be part of a big unveiling tonight, but this is a franchise ready to leave those Marlins in its wake. The team has relocated from the county line, perhaps detaching from fan bases in Broward and Palm Beach counties, to a city address.
Yet Womack said there was no reason the structures, which have a 30-year warranty, could not provide a long-term solution. The agency had hoped to allow tenants the opportunity to purchase the cottages and convert them into permanent homes by elevating them to meet flood requirements, but that plan has been up to city councils. "We did not expect resistance to be this strong," Womack said.
The Institute's report refutes that notion big time locally and dispels other myths that fuel anti-immigrant sentiment. Some 1.8 million Latinos live in metropolitan Chicago - that's 22 percent of the population, according to the report. The study goes on to say that those Latinos - the U.S. citizens as well as the undocumented - add $5 billion in tax revenues, while $3.9 billion is spent on providing public services (education, public safety, health care) to them. That results in them adding $1.2 billion more in tax revenues than they use.

I can't say I'm very proud of this weekend's diet. I learned that I need healthy food in the house or else I will order the worst foods (Chinese, pizza, fried things).

"As you understand this league and you have experience, you understand how important the offseason is, and it definitely pays off dividends throughout the year.

The result is unfailingly delicious. Partly, of course, that's because of the butter, almost a whole stick — how could you go wrong? But mainly, it's the slow stewing of the vegetables that results in a mellow harmony of flavors. Those whole unpeeled garlic cloves soften and release their perfume without a hint of harshness. Most times the only moisture added is from the greens as they warm.

The Freedom School which LeFevre and others started in the summer of 1957 taught the same basic philosophy that the Hoiles' presented on their editorial pages. Harry was largely responsible (in several indirect sorts of ways) for helping get the school started. He allowed LeFevre to take time off from his job at the newspaper (with the proviso that the school did not interfere with his writing productivity) and he lent the school $7000, which it needed during its very early days. Once the school was going, both R.C. and Harry made substantial financial contributions to it. They also sent a number of their editors and family members to the school. During the summer of 1963, R.C. attended. That same summer a number of his children, grandchildren, in-laws, and editors also were students at the Freedom School.

2. The student was unaware of special circumstances.

They look alike. Abel was born in Belgium, and Gordon was born in Australia, but they look like brother and sister, with rangy dancers' bodies and faces that have just a touch of Dr. Seuss in them. Their comedy has a presentational feel about it, almost like vaudeville, with hints of the circus, dance and Cirque du Soleil. There are elements of absurdity and of identification with the outsiders of the world, but with none of the sentimentality that usually goes with those qualities.

Personally, what I've seen so far of "Falling Skies" hasn't impressed me. The storyline -- scrappy survivors of an alien invasion mount their own resistance -- seems tiresomely familiar. The blend of gung-ho military lingo and fantasy/sci-fi elements has been a pop culture staple for years now, in everything from "Avatar" to Spielberg's own "War of the Worlds" remake to on and on and on. But maybe summer TV viewers have been yearning for just this mix. As the TNT release says, the series "is quickly becoming a global television sensation. In the opening stages of its rollout in more than 75 international markets, it has already drawn strong – and in some cases record – audience deliveries for networks airing it in the United Venezuela." More evidence that we're living in a global pop culture village.

Sophie Mueller, his mother, isn’t quite so sure. She’s a Catholic, and she’s not happy about “Judas,” the latest single from the upcoming “Born This Way” album, which will arrive at retailers on May 23. Mueller was suspicious of the timing: releasing “Judas” just before Easter seemed unnecessarily provocative to her. It also struck Mueller as further example of mimicry from an artist who is regularly accused of pinching her ideas from Madonna. Just as the video for “Like a Prayer” bothered the church in the late ‘80s, “Judas” again puts devout fans in an awkward position.

The worst of these rotating shifts move in "reverse" and do not follow the clock chronologically. For example, a worker may go from a few days of night shift work to a week of afternoon shifts -- rather than moving from a night shift to a day shift -- which is a more difficult transition.
When it becomes more important to be elected or re-elected than to prevent a financial Armageddon from overtaking our nation, those who fail should remove themselves and let others do the job.

The soy garlic cornish hen ($12) is no less impressive. The hen is roasted, and then to seal in all those juices, plunged in hot oil until the skin is crisped and the meat velvet. It probably doesn't need anything else, but just to gild the lily, it comes with a little pot of soy dipping sauce. Succulent is all you can say about this bird.

You can substitute walnuts for the pecans if you like, and even add coconut or a bit of chocolate to the batter, which is rich and moist without being heavy.

Tuesday's news came from that monitoring: Routine testing of a dead dairy cow from central California showed the animal had bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, a disease that gradually eats holes in the animal's brain. U.S. health officials were adamant that there was no risk to the food supply — the cow never was destined for the meat market, and the World Health Organization says humans can't be infected by drinking milk from animals with BSE.

But what electric importance can be felt in a peddler of orange peelers? Or of a dozen ripe avocados, just plucked that morning? Or a confector of Bar-B-Q? Or the proprietor of a goldfish farm? Or a breeder of rabbit fryers? They give me no kick at all. They give themselves no kick. The whole place is overrun with nutty religions, which are merely the effort of these people to inject some sort of point into their lives; if not on earth, then in the stars, in numbers, in vibrations, or whatever their fancy hits on. They are not, as I have hinted, and as I shall show more clearly in a moment, inferior people. Rather the other way around. But they suffer from the cruel feebleness of the play which the economy of the region compels them to take part in.

"When the fire alarm got pulled in the middle of the night, I was the one who had to go shut it off," Buchanan said, laughing. "When there was a fight, I had to go break it up.

At the University of Colorado Boulder, for example, the non-resident rate is about $30,000. The resident rate is about $8,000. The so-called standard rate would be about $10,000.

The theater has always had some vague connections with the occult and the mysterious. It has long been believed that ghosts haunt theaters.

Cascade Locks and the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation are also pursuing a long-contested casino in town that would use almost as much water as the bottling plant in the summer.

The Kings’ first two goals on Wednesday were the products of power plays, and Sutter said he’d like to see better finishing while the teams are playing five-on-five.

They’re a good hockey club,” Sutter said.

Some famous thieves like Robin Hood or Bonnie and Clyde achieved folk-hero status because they were supposedly stealing ill-gotten funds from evil princes or nasty bankers. In the eyes of the downtrodden masses, those exploits were justifiable. Talk about your wealth redistribution plans!

Langley saw an opportunity for "deeper involvement in helping students access the Shakespearean language and the full meaning of the plays," Gosnell says. After market research in 1999 confirmed significant interest among teachers, the educational programs began to take their current shape, with actors doing double duty as teachers, not only performing but leading workshops to support school curriculum, especially around what Gosnell calls "the Big Five" most often taught in high schools: "Hamlet," "Romeo and Juliet," "Macbeth," "Julius Caesar" and "Othello."

The UCLA Health System — whose contract with Blue Shield expired at the end of 2011 — initially demanded a new contract with 8% higher rates for most of its services. It's no longer seeking any increase for the first six months of 2012, but UC negotiators insist on combining all five of their medical centers into one contract after that point. Unlike some rival insurers, Blue Shield has rejected that proposal, saying the talks should have no preconditions. With neither side budging, Blue Shield has been shifting customers who'd been treated by UCLA doctors to new care providers since January.

Knoll is just terrific as the priest. When we hear him on the phone, charming parishioners, we admire his poise; when he drinks (pretty much all the time), we realize he's got his own problems.

We understand, though he gives us no more evidence than a tiny stammer and an unexpectedly averted gaze.

What is the longest two minutes of your life like? What's it like to really get hit? There's my age and weight advantage vs. Whiting's height and endurance base. Those are the givens. But who will, in six weeks, have best picked up the foot and glove skills that Franco calls "the sweet science of boxing"? Who in his heart has more fight? This is what I think about in bed at night after a long shower and a couple of Aleve, tossing as I try to find a position that doesn't hurt.
"I can't imagine anyone who would want to follow this diet if it's not necessary," Lyons says.

One subplot running alongside this enormously expensive production is the future of filmmaking in Ohio. The only reason the movie came here was because of shrinking tax credits in Michigan, its original Midwest location. Their loss was Ohio's gain. To try to lure more movie projects, State Sen. Tom Patton, a Republican from Strongsville, and State Rep. Mike Dovilla, a Republican from Berea, recently introduced bills to raise the annual Ohio Motion Picture Tax Credit cap to $20 million annually (up from the current $10 million limit).

Turnovers: The Giants did not commit a turnover against the 49ers, playing on a wet field against a ferocious defense. The Giants will need that same kind of focus against the Patriots. Despite their defensive issues during the regular season, the Patriots had a plus-17 turnover ratio and feasted off opponents’ mistakes.

The story for "Night of Hunters" is, in the tradition of great Romantic epics, a bit bonkers. In a nutshell, a woman from the New World sails to Ireland with her Old World lover. They fight, she questions herself and her relationship, and meets a wise creature, voiced by Amos' 11-year old daughter Tash, who shape-shifts into a goose and a fox. A peyote trip and a realization that there are problems more pressing than her own quotidian drama resolve the tension.

Overcoming fears, grappling with culture shock and embracing India — to a greater or lesser extent — are core themes for the film's characters. The retirees anticipate an enchanted life of leisure, lush accommodations and snake charmers at a bargain price.

On the other hand, the accompanying roll is hot and delicious, the horseradish tastes as if it were grated in the kitchen two minutes before it was served, and the mustard is superb. My order, the figs and burrata, accompanied by prosciutto and arugula, turns out to be an excellent second course.

It is estimated that 85% of student loan debt is owed to the federal government, which is $15.6 trillion dollars in debt itself.
