In Borneo, wildfires, logging and palm oil plantations have helped wipe out most of the orangutans' natural habitat. Indonesia, which boasts the most tropical forests in the world after Brazil, continues to lose millions of forest acres each year, thanks to the rising popularity of palm oil as a cooking oil and biofuel. The forests are burned, the peat swamps drained, and palm trees are planted instead.
Cleveland (6-8) was a bit lethargic in Tuesday's return from a seven-game road trip, a 105-95 loss to Golden State, but it was flat-out bad Friday. Reigning MVP Derrick Rose sat out for Chicago, but the Cavaliers couldn't come close to taking advantage in a 114-75 loss - the worst at home in franchise history.
"He just wanted to get a little conversation, start talking about the playbook a little bit and make sure we're on the same page of what he's expecting from me," Hill said. "I'm just trying to learn from him."
"Once we got going as a group, James really factored into the game with his size and speed," Laviolette said. "He hadn't had at that point a whole lot of competition, even in drills and practice. The week (off) really provided an opportunity to push him with his conditioning and his pace and his on-ice play. After a good week of practice, we wanted to put him in the position where he could try to be successful and I thought he was."

In New Jersey, Bastianich revisited North Bergen, where the small ranch perched on the Palisades where her family first lived is long gone, but she did enjoy a lunch of eggplant meatballs and fried zucchini at Di Palma Brothers Restaurant on Kennedy Boulevard. She stopped by Jerry’s Gourmet in Englewood, where one of her old restaurant employees is now a mozzarella maker.
When Green challenged Bun’s assertion from the stand that he was reacting to a perceived threat to protect his friend, Toan Nguwen, the driver of the car he was riding in, Bun became hostile. Nguwen earlier testified that he had warned Bun, "Don't do anything stupid."

"My concern is that the players that are coming into the lineup from long-term injury - they are good players that are coming back - I want to get them up to speed so they become full-time players. That's a focus for me.
Yet Jefferson proved more than willing to let partisan advantage trump what "would be best." As the 1800 election approached, his Republican supporters in Virginia, mindful that their opponents in the Federalist Party had won five of the state's electoral votes in 1796, replaced the district system with "winner take all" -- thereby guaranteeing Jefferson all of Virginia's electoral votes. (Massachusetts, the home of Jefferson's rival, John Adams, retaliated by entrusting the selection of electors to the Federalist-dominated legislature.) A few years later, Jefferson, as president, backed away from supporting a constitutional amendment mandating a district system throughout the nation -- a strategy that would have eliminated the potential unfairness of having a district approach in some states and the winner-take-all system in others -- because "winner take all" appeared to be benefiting his party.
Mayor Alvin Parks said he had no immediate reaction to Durbin's comments but would hold a news conference on the matter today. The mayor has said that the clubs bring in much-needed tax revenue, which helps to keep police officers on the streets.
Given the complexity of the questions, it's no wonder the two main pieces of legislation filed in response to the Turner decision would kick problems down the road or punt altogether.

About 100 yen ($1.20) buys amulets granting good health, good grades, release from tension, career advancement, a strong marriage or good luck in "traffic safety." Candles for 50 yen with the same themes are bought and burned. Packets of three pieces of incense are sold for 30 yen. An offering can be given and a prayer made, then perhaps granted by the swinging of a large rope that, when done properly, sets off a gong high on the temple rim.

Consumers bought so much Jif Peanut Butter before a scheduled 30-percent price increase on Nov. 1 that the company ended up selling much less of it during the third quarter.
It's all part of an overall theme of uncertainty and regret, one that is best expressed by Kindermann's musings on his life's work, about what he views as "a peculiar irony at work in the world: what you lack will always be magnified by the people and events that constitute your life. A boy with no appreciation for food will be born into a family of cooks and live above a bakery. A woman who feels no kindness for her children will see, everywhere she goes, mothers and fathers fawning over their babies. So it was with him. He'd gravitated to a career as a summer camp director. All his life he'd been exasperated by other people's unwise longings."
San Jose city leaders are so far considering something short of a total ban or cap. If the current proposal is recommended to the City Council on May 15, new applicants would not be allowed to move into low-income neighborhoods but could open elsewhere in the city. They would have to stay only 500 feet from other payday lending establishments -- not the 1,000 feet or more required in other cities that have tried to rein in payday lending. And there would be no limits on their proximity to liquor stores, bars and "adult" businesses.
"The good thing about this ESPN poll, we didn't ask for it, we didn't do that research, it came over the transom," Garber said. "That's empowering to us ... that gives us a market. We've got to go out and try to capture that market with the right players, with the right programming, with the right stadiums, with the right experiences. I can't imagine how we don't do that. The question isn't if, it's a matter of how long will it take to be able to achieve it."

McDiarmid acted beneath geological layers of latex. Worse: When he wasn't buried under rubber, he was performing opposite wood — namely Hayden Christensen, who does not have five decades on the London stage behind him. But like Timon, let's be generous here. While making the first "Star Wars," Harrison Ford famously told George Lucas: "You can type this (expletive), George, but you sure as hell can't say it." Indeed, few could. Alec Guinness could. And so could McDiarmid. He's been drippingly memorable.

You think you're all set for Passover -- but maybe you forgot about your pet?
Hey, Jason: My biggest knock on Shurmur is that he tried to go from Point A to Point D without touching Points B and C. By that I mean he gave Colt McCoy too much responsibility right off the bat. I think he should have leaned on the running game he inherited early to help the offensive line and McCoy settle into a rhythm together. I do think the absence of the off-season minicamps with his new team has much to do with the slow development of the offense.
Christie was initially vague about what he knew of the activities. When first asked about the disclosure, he called it "disturbing" and said he might have been briefed in 2007 but didn’t remember.

Georgia has something of a split personality when it comes to gay issues. Atlanta is a gay mecca – a longtime beacon for gay Southerners from small towns. But it sits in the socially-conservative Bible Belt. Seventy-six percent of Georgians in 2004 backed a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage
So far, Booker’s greatest success has been garnering $43 million in matching funds to the Facebook donation, but the pitfalls surrounding private donations in schools came to light last week when it was discovered that part of a $500,000 grant from the Broad Foundation funded a proposal to "co-locate" new district and charter schools with more than a dozen current schools. The plan was obtained by The Star-Ledger and rankled parents and educators who felt they had been misled.

Which brings us to 2012, where, with his eighth team in his 25th big-league season, Moyer made his first appearance Saturday in nearly 21 months — adding to his MLB record for homers allowed (513) — in a 7-3 loss to the Astros. But in his next start, he could become the oldest player in MLB history to win a game. And when I’m dead a quarter-century from now, I just hope ESPN Afterlife has highlights of a 74-year-old Moyer breaking Cy Young’s career record for wins.
That's familiar territory for Kansas. There have been 21 such meetings in Big 12 history, and KU has been involved in 15 of them. It would be Baylor's first such contest.
4. Jon Diebler is as poised as ever to be a factor. He’s made the most 3-pointers in Big Ten history (370), hitting 46.6% of his attempts from beyond the arc. Against a Kentucky team that will likely sell out on Sullinger to try and limit points in the paint, look for Diebler to get early shots.

"Deep-sea animals, in general, tend to produce fewer offspring than shallower water animals, so if they are going to have a population impact, it may be more sensitive in deep water," he said. "There is also some evidence that deep-sea animals live longer than shallower water species, so the impact may stay around longer."

It turns out, the words that physicians and healthcare providers use to warn parents that their children are carrying too much weight really do matter: The survey suggests that parents who hear terms they feel are stigmatizing or convey blame may be more motivated to avoid the doctor who uttered those terms than they are to help junior eat and exercise his way to a healthy weight.

Indeed, much of "West Cross Timbers," Shires’ first solo record, felt as indebted to Willa Cather and Eudora Welty as it does to Emmylou Harris or Dolly Parton. "Carrying Lightning," a collection of love stories, simply seems like the diary entries of a woman whose wanderlust is barely contained by her small town circumstances. Shires, who takes her lyrics as seriously as any prose writer, often uses assignments and exercises to spark her creativity.
"The prosecution's evidence is good enough to get to the jury, but conviction remains an open question," said Steve Friedland, a former federal prosecutor and professor at Elon University School of Law who has attended the trial. "The case is largely built on circumstantial evidence. There is no smoking gun."
It is a great achievement, although it hardly makes Jeter the greatest Yankee. It says much about the franchise that he will likely be regarded by historians as a member in good standing of the second rank of godlings in the pinstriped pantheon.

If you'd rather try something that doesn't require tanning, depilation and skimpy outfits, consider a fundraiser like the AIDS LifeCycle — a seven-day, 545-mile ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles. It's too late for this year (the ride begins June 5), but imagine the shape you'd be in if you registered for 2012 and started training.

NBC EMPLOYEES have some mandatory summer reading ahead of them that won't be anywhere near as pulse-pounding as "Fifty Shades of Grey." A network insider tells us that in an eye-raising instance of life-imitating-"30 Rock," a low-level staffer at the Comcast-owned network went around handing out copies of "An Incredible Dream: Ralph Roberts and the Story of Comcast." The 424-page doorstop of a book was written by William Novak and reportedly commissioned by Comcast, which may have something to do with why the book is not available on Amazon.

Snyder does believe standards set by Idaho's midwife licensing that took effect in 2010 have fostered communication between most midwives and doctors, despite problems investigators found at The Baby Place.

We can't disagree with those Owens, Grange and Johnson being in the top three. But Magic as No. 1? Seriously? Not because he wasn't a great player. But come on. He was only in college for two years. And what he did in his college years is the ONLY thing that matters, according to the network's own rules:

Lisa Maldonado, executive director of the North Bay Labor Council, which gave the bridge coalition strike sanction, said bridge managers and unions were still negotiating and hoping to avoid a strike.
Backers of the platform plank argue that full support for same-sex marriage could motivate Democratic constituencies and potentially appeal to independents. Given Obama's backing for gays being able to serve openly in the military and his administration's steps to provide federal benefits to gay couples, a further shift would do little to rally opponents, they say.
Hodgson, 64, has coached 18 teams -- including the national squads of Switzerland, Finland and the United Arab Emirates -- during a 36-year career. His current 16-month contract with West Brom doesn't expire until next month, but the club has agreed to release him when the season ends May 13 so that Hodgson can begin preparing for Euro 2012.
The Oscar-winning Dench, perhaps best known as James Bond's mysterious boss M, has been dealing with two different forms of macular generation -- one in each eye. According to Reuters, she can no longer read scripts and has to have someone read them out loud to her, "like reading me a story."

The qualified endorsements by Anthony Wieners and Ed Brannigan, who represent more than 49,000 officers between them, could add momentum to calls for expanded testing following a series of Star-Ledger reports last week showing hundreds of law enforcement officers and firefighters obtained steroids and human growth hormone from a doctor who often prescribed them illegally.

As someone who has covered and followed University of Maryland athletics since coming to The Baltimore Sun more than 25 years ago, I have the unique perspective of not only comparing coaches but athletic directors as well.
Harman quickly intervened and wound up establishing a groundbreaking program aimed at improving conditions for employees. Workers could earn idle time by producing their quotas faster and go home earlier. For the mostly African American work force, Harman established an on-site school, daycare and a worker-run newspaper, uncensored by management. The "Bolivar Experiment" proved so successful at what was dubbed "participatory management" that the company had to restrict visitors.

--The median age for Hispanics and Asians edged lower -- to 27.4 and 35.3 respectively -- compared to 36.8 for the total population. The median age for blacks was unchanged at 31.3, while whites rose slightly to 41.2, due mostly to an aging boomer population.
Porter is now the resource officer for the Probation Office. It's his job to identify needs and connect the people under supervision with the resources they need to make the transition from prison. Sometimes it's classes of one sort or another. Sometimes it's a washing machine.
It's a bit overstated to say that "The Prisoner of Azkaban" is the installment where the Harry Potter character comes of age. Radcliffe is becoming an adept actor, but the character's maturation from movie to movie has been too incremental to produce a believably teenage wizard, with girl problems and a wolfbane addiction. Nonetheless, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is the first movie in the series that might keep the skeptics rapt until the next magic show.
As the government prepares to update U.S. dietary guidelines next week, the Library of Congress culled its archives and, with Weight Watchers International, gathered experts recently to discuss this country's history of weight loss.

What was not disclosed at the time is that the agreement specifically requires Motorola Mobility to retain a workforce here of 2,500 workers. The company disclosed in the contract that it employs 3,290 people at its locations in Libertyville and Chicago, which therefore allows it to reduce the size of its workforce and still get the credits.
"It remains an open and serious question whether the military as an institution or the generals and ex-generals will stomach the idea - much less the reality - of a landslide by Aung San Suu Kyi and her party in 2015," he said.

This is amazing to me. When I first started tasting wine as a very young man in Europe, it was very rare to have wines from neighboring countries available, let alone from around the world. Folks tended to drink local and/or from their own region or country. The wine-shop owner was the most important person in town. Each had a regional specialty; when the city was big enough, the shop owner with the best relationships in the region had the best wines. All trust was put into them to buy and select for you.
After Watney eliminated Woods, Golf Channel/NBC, which had interviewed all the winners, first, went to Woods. He delicately was asked about the result. He gave no credit to Watney, who played very well, and he was not asked one question about Watney’s play. Only Tiger can beat Tiger, ya know?
"I thought we were absolutely prepared and PISA wasn't too much of a challenge for me," Drake said. "Our teachers thoroughly explained what the test would be about so we weren't blind-sided by it."

Christie also took aim at Associate Justice Barry Albin, singling him out as an example of how “judges have lost their sense of place in our democracy.”
Employers have added an average of only 72,000 jobs per month in the past five months. That's far below the 100,000 per month needed to keep up with population growth. And it's down from an average of 180,000 in the first four months of this year.
But I believe the best bet for the hot months is adding new interesting wines to the traditional lineup.

Though the Cardinals put him in center and at second base to get his bat in the lineup, Craig was limited by his knee injury. In midseason, he cracked his right kneecap when crashed into a metal fence at Houston's Minute Maid Park. Craig had five homers, 11 RBIs and a .375 average in the final 10 games of the season, helping to spur the Cardinals to the National League wild card.
As in many states, both programs were considered separate from the base funding received by schools. That made them easily expendable when recession hit in the early 2000s. They died when legislators stopped funding them.

Sordyl was cited in April over a Westland sign-ordinance violation. According to a police report, an officer told Sordyl, whose group had staked three signs into the ground, that she could not post signs on public property. Sordyl told the officer she did not have to remove the signs. According to the report, the officer said Sordyl "then told me to issue her the citation, and (said) that I could speak to her ACLU attorney."

That's the message Adams will deliver to Multnomah County Chairman Jeff Cogen at 5:30 p.m. today in their first face-to-face meeting since tensions between the city and county surfaced publicly three weeks ago. In a stinging Sept. 14 letter, Cogen accused Adams of making "an ever changing assortment of additional demands" toward the Sellwood project that were "seemingly designed not to reach a deal but rather to drag on the negotiations indefinitely."
Francis Slay met with a gathering of Occupy St. Louis protesters Tuesday, talking for more than two hours but coming to no immediate agreement.
I suggest the "thumpers" check more the "literal Bible" they profess to know so much about. At times, the early church at Rome may have presumed things about "their" God that were not that helpful, perhaps believing they had superior knowledge of the creator than those of other places. St. Paul had to call them to task as he wrote in his letter to them "Oh the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways. For who has known the mind of the Lord?"
As SLU has made its charge to 22-5, winning six straight and nine of 10 games going into today's game at Rhode Island, taking a firm grab on second place in the Atlantic 10 and standing on the brink of its first NCAA berth in more than a decade, no player has done as consistently well as McCall.

I don't remember Mr. Huntley being in my Psych 101 class when we studied loaded words and propaganda, but he must have been in the front row taking notes. Let's face it - both sides can spin statistics. When Huntley rails against the Affordable Care Act, he omits the fact that the insurance mandate was born from the conservative Heritage Foundation and supported by many Republicans until Obama adopted their plan. Even more interesting, the bill is modeled after the Massachusetts plan developed by Mitt Romney.
Ramundo, then 42, was a sergeant in the Passaic County Sheriff’s Department. Now retired, he said Colao reviewed his blood tests and told him he needed testosterone, HCG and human growth hormone, all of which were delivered to Ramundo’s Wanaque home from Lowen’s Pharmacy in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

Survivors stop to photograph the fluttering green kite. They gaze at the apocalyptic scene of destruction that surrounds. Visible in the distance, out on the coast, is a single tree that survived out of thousands in a famed forest that lined a white-sand beach.

Hooker worked boogie magic with just one chord and a preternaturally deep voice. The blues legend died in 2001, but his spirit is as vital as ever throughout such calling-card songs as “Boogie Chillen',” “I'm in the Mood” and “Boom Boom,” don't overlook “I'm Bad Like Jesse James” and other lesser-known gems.

We've never forgotten Richard the cat. Since our honeymoon 17 years ago, he has become as much a part of our mental scrapbook as that flat tire on my old Benz. The fading Kodak photos we took of this cocky little cat are mixed with our wedding and honeymoon photos, and his story is fondly shared as an indelible part of our memories. Richard, our extraordinary cat friend, would be 17 now. We hope our latter-day Puss 'n Boots is still roaming the banks of the Russian River and having great adventures; fearless, confident, independent and providing visitors with a lifetime of memories.
Yet that might be changing. Top women trail runners Caitlin Smith and Devon Crosby Helms have qualified for January's Olympic marathon trials, in between their ultra triumphs. And, among men, the indefatigable Michael Wardian has toggled between road and ultras at a dizzying rate.

As written by Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec, whose credits include the "Alias" TV show, "Mission Impossible" is essentially a series of elaborate action set pieces.

Longer term, the government is considering reducing its role in the mortgage market. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have cost taxpayers a commitment of $163 billion combined, will be wound down. Though they may be replaced, it is clear there is no interest in Washington to provide the kind of backing banks have enjoyed historically. That means they will have to keep more mortgages on the books, something bankers have said privately they aren't willing to do.

But on the bright side, we now have Unwine'd, an opportunity to taste wines from 100 Oregon vignerons, including the sorts of small labels I used to discover at the Indie event.

In the event of a lockout, Umenyiora and all players would work out on their own.

It's energetic music anyway -- an Allegretto takes the place of the traditional slow movement, and most of the rest is Vivace, Scherzo and Allegro con brio -- and Edwards took it at a pretty good clip, with enhanced dynamic contrasts and relentless forward motion. Balance was off in louder passages, with trumpets and first violins dominating, and the players could have been more quickly responsive through some transitions.
