There's a series of things that deal with transparency which is very consistent since I was the one that made the pledge. Very consistent with what I said about the government, but you may want to twist that. That's your right, but you cannot deny this.

The Obama education reform plan is an aggressive version of the Bush administration's No Child Left Behind, under which many schools have narrowed their curriculum to the tested subjects of reading and math. This poor substitute for a well-rounded education, which includes subjects such as the arts, history, geography, civics, science and foreign language, hits low-income children the hardest, since they are the most likely to attend the kind of "failing school" that drills kids relentlessly on the basics. Emphasis on test scores already compels teachers to focus on test preparation. Holding teachers personally and exclusively accountable for test scores -- a key feature of Race to the Top -- will make this situation even worse. Test scores will determine salary, tenure, bonuses and sanctions, as teachers and schools compete with each other, survival-of-the-fittest style.

"Coriolanus" is a problematic play about an unsympathetic character, but Fiennes and screenwriter John Logan ("Hugo") charge fearlessly forward.

Instead of repeating that mistake, Congress should create a Medicare payment system that rewards doctors and hospitals for using data, patterns and evidence that point to the best way to treat their patients. So-called "evidence-based medicine" will never be perfect, but it could improve the quality of care patients receive by regularly tracking patient outcomes. Instead of just rewarding medical providers for the volume of services they provide, which we do today, the feds -- and private insurers -- should reward them based on their results.

1. Miller fits. He's not perfect, but he fits the Meyer offense. He threw one interception to sophomore cornerback Adam Griffin (yes, the son of Archie) and had another potential pick bounce off a defender and into the hands of tight end Nick Vannett.

The set list at the Garden was not quite as crowd-pleasing as the two from Springsteen's Jersey shows. The Boss reached into the back catalog for at least two tracks that casual fans might have a tough time recognizing: the uptempo "Murder Incorporated" and the terrific "Lion's Den," an outtake from "Born in the U.S.A." that reworks the Biblical tale of Daniel into a comeback story. Springsteen also returned to "41 Shots," the elegy written in the wake of the police shooting of the unarmed Amadou Diallo. But every downcast number was answered with anthems of resistance and rebirth: "The Rising," "Out in the Street," "The Promised Land," and other favorites.

As I've noted before in this column, the logic underlying the Browns' request is reasonable: It's cheaper to fix things now rather than later, and the cash is coming from a pot of money filled by taxes collected on alcohol and tobacco sales, known as a "sin tax," and not from the city's tight general fund. The city, which owns the stadium, can't spend the pot of money -- which tops out at $29 million -- on anything but stadium fixes.

The Steakhouse Burger, pictured at left, was big and luscious, but we thought the buttered-and-toasted ciabatta roll was too much bread for the meat. The soup of the day was an incredible roasted corn-jalapeño flecked with drops of chili oil  sweet 'n' heat.
I cannot imagine why the situation in Frogtown should be handled so differently than one just days earlier in which a bear that had wandered onto the campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder was moved to a more suitable habitat.

Unlike his predecessor, Weatherford can drive it out of bounds when he needs to. He likens his craft to golf: He has a long-range game and a short-range game, “and even though I’m a terrible golfer, I have several clubs in my bag — I can hit it short and high like a 9-iron, or use a driver and hit it high and far. And like golf, if you’re off by a millimeter in your mechanics, you can look really dumb.”

Admirably brave though it was to do performance and installation art in the face of government oppression, the work that emerged from this movement was highly uneven. Typical of its cheeky spirit is Wang Jin's deadpan "To Marry a Mule," a 1995 self-portrait done in protest against the bureaucratic refusal to allow him to join his wife in the U.S.
Lawmakers who want to end an often-abused legislative scholarship program were hopeful for a breakthrough after a top leader in the Illinois Senate got on board today.
The newest public safety initiative, called the Enhanced Police Reserve Program, will make it a requirement that any person who applies to become a Detroit police officer must first serve as an active reservist.

"Most of our churches are in target areas where there is blight," Flowers said.
In 2007, Phoenix agreed to return to CityNorth's developers half of the sales taxes collected for 11 years, or $97.4 million, whichever comes first. In return, CityNorth agreed to open 1.2 million square feet of retail space before the agreement kicks in and to build a garage with 3,000 spaces of free parking, including 200 spots for a park-and-ride lot. The garage would enable developers to increase the size of the project, which would mean higher tax collections.

Stormwater management, a component of flood control, involves planting trees, limiting development, and decreasing construction of pavement, cement, and other impervious surfaces, in addition to many other approaches. These practices all lead to greater absorption of water in the ground and in plant life during storm events.
Sound familiar? After President Obama's speech last year announcing the escalation of the war in Afghanistan, a Times editorial noted that the president said the aim is "to deploy troops to target the insurgency and protect cities while building up the Afghan military and government -- 'nation-building,' without the scary name, in a country that has studiously resisted previous attempts by outsiders to forge a central state."
Besides, the 10th was a solidly Democratic district and if its voters chose to express their eccentricity by sending to Congress a fellow with a long history of wandering off into the political, fiscal and ideological weeds, well, what was the harm?

But to truly grasp the significance of these creations, the taco must be eaten in the company of Gustavo Arellano, a journalist and Orange County native, who is perhaps the greatest (and only) living scholar of Mexican-American fast food. And preferably, you will eat it in San Bernardino, the birthplace of U.S. fast food, while he explains to you precisely how the Frito, America's first corn chip, was copied from the Mexican tostado, then evolved into the Dorito and eventually the Tostito.
The couple separated earlier this year, according to the statement from their lawyer, who said there would be no further comment. Mendes, who directed his wife in "Revolutionary Road," for which she won one of her Golden Globes, was absent from Winslet's arm during the recent awards season. She walked the red carpet at the Oscars alone.
That excludes residents like Stacey Loftin, 33, who rented before the 2005 hurricane and has been living with her three children in a FEMA trailer in her mother's frontyard. Loftin was thrilled when a Mississippi official said she qualified for a cottage, but then the Bay St. Louis City Council told her she could not put a cottage in her mother's backyard. "I just wanted to cry," she said. "I'm not trying to beat the system. I work 40-plus hours a week. And still I can't get a break."

We strayed from the comfort-food motif with coffee-rubbed strip steak ($16.99), which was enticing in concept but flawed in execution. A hefty 12-ounce slab of meat was rubbed with ground coffee, pan-seared, cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices that showed off the rich maroon of the ordered-rare steak, then brushed with a bourbon glaze that gave the coffee rub the flavor of an after-dinner drink. The problem was the steak itself: The slices were lightly marbled in the center but poorly trimmed and had gristle at both ends.

Until, after 18 years, Dad re-enters his life. Nick stumbles into a job at a homeless shelter, and through the men he meets there and the things he sees, the petty degradations of their lives and his – bandaging, clothing and de-lousing them – he might come to grips with this troubling relationship with the homeless man he long knew through the old man's pretentious, insanely over-confident letters.

This is an open letter to Charlie Dooley concerning closing the county parks on your hit list: Instead, put a tax on all toilet paper. Everyone buys and uses toilet paper. That's a fair tax. Everyone would have to pay that tax - not just homeowners. Also, cut your salary and fringe benefits you receive and those of all your friends you have hired in. That would be a nice chunk of change saved. Sounds like a good beginning.

The Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR), for example, is a regulation that requires energy power plants in 27 states to reduce emissions. And as Texas Gov.

CSAPR was such a clear sign of dramatic EPA overreach that the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered a delay of the rule until its legal merits were determined.

Together, they turn Manhattan into little more than a shooting gallery, stacking up corpses in service of a supposed story about one man's path to redemption.

Williams is the former defensive coordinator of the New Orleans Saints and other high profile jobs in the NFL, and now works for the St. Louis Rams. The accusations against him in the NFL investigation are that he allegedly paid out cash rewards to players while with the Saints for -- among other things -- knocking opponents out of the game. The profile matched the bonus: Bigger name, better pay.

* But I don't criticize Mike Matheny as much as I lament the nature of modern baseball; all managers have the same philosophy. It rarely matters how well a starter is throwing, or how effortless he is making it seem. When he gets to the 7th inning, managers start twitching in the dugout. They have to start cranking up the bullpen. They have to fall in line with all of the other managers. Why? Because it's simply the way it's done now. That's all. Matheny, like the other 29 managers, is just a product of the times. Manager see; manager do. There isn't much, if any, space in the modern dugout for independent thinkers.

DuBois' observations were brief yet controversial (one reader called them "unkind and uncalled for"), and he defended them in the next edition of the magazine. "We love to think of the Great as flawless," DuBois wrote. "We yearn in our imperfection toward perfection -- sinful, we envisage Righteousness." Such idolatry, however, serves little purpose: If we require the perfect and the righteous to lead us to higher ground, then we are not likely to get there, for there is not exactly a burgeoning oversupply of perfect and righteous leaders.

Because the chambers are small, claustrophobia also can be an issue. But all kinds of things help with that, including the chambers' see-through walls, TVs mounted on top of them, anti-anxiety or muscle-relaxing medication -- if necessary -- and microphones that allow patients to talk to the doctors, nurses and technicians who watch over them. Safety regulations require that someone who's trained in hyperbaric medicine monitor the chambers whenever a patient is inside.
Scene 5: "Mamitas," directed by Nicholas Ozeki, is set in the Los Angeles Mexican-American community, and if it tells the tale of a bad boy who isn't so bad after all, a story we've seen many times, it tells it well. I loved "Mamitas" and its cast of young unknowns.

The title of Jeffrey Clements' first book says it all: In "Corporations Are Not People: Why They Have More Rights Than You Do and What You Can Do About It," he dives into the controversy over the Supreme Court's 2010 ruling on Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission and its aftereffects. In Citizens United, the Supreme Court ruled broadly that corporations, as "associations of citizens," enjoy the same rights as individuals to engage in political speech.

Answer: It required a method where they could roll in a machine with an applicator. We take out the tumor, make sure we have the target; we then have the pathologist look at the edges. The surgeon looks at the cavity and puts an applicator in that space. We sterilely drape, pull back the skin edges, and then we step out and a physicist and radiation oncologist deliver radiation therapy when the patient is asleep. Then they turn the machine off, and I go back in and close the wound.

The financial stakes are enormous, because advertisers pay the most for young eyeballs. "Idol" earned $688 million in advertising revenue last year, down 7% from the previous year, according to an estimate from research firm Kantar Media. By comparison, "The Voice" racked up just $57 million because it was a new show with no track record and also because it lasted well into the summer, when viewing is lower. Nevertheless, "The Voice" has revived NBC's prime-time prospects and speculation has it that the show will return in the fall, although the network has confirmed nothing.

You cannot control her choice to be in this relationship. You can only promise to always be there for her and her family -- not to bail her out but to be available to listen and advise her when she comes to you for help.

Neil Smit, the cable division president, said in the conference call that the company hiked cable rates in 62 percent of Comcast’s franchise areas in the first quarter, compared with 34 percent in the year-ago quarter. Rate hikes lead to higher churn as customers cancel service or seek to negotiate lower rates. “It is great to have this rate increase event behind us,” Smit said on the call.
Autumn Barnes of Hampton, is more skeptical. "I'm sorry — medical, dental, body alteration companies that opt to blast out bulk coupons via Groupon, etc. to bulk up their clientele numbers, unless they are brand new, make me wonder why they aren't getting in new clients via word of mouth." That said, she acknowledges that her husband bought himself a massage through a daily deal site one time.

None of Sendak's books were memoirs, but all were personal, if only for their celebrations of disobedience and intimations of fear and death and dislocation, sketched in haunting waves of pen and ink. "It's a Jewish way of getting through life," Kushner said last fall. "You acknowledge what is spectacular and beautiful and also you don't close your eyes to the pain and the difficulty."

Even if Derrick Rose's torn anterior cruciate ligament was a random event and not the result of wear-and-tear from the compressed post-lockout schedule, you'll be spittin' into the wind trying to argue that Rose's five previous injuries and 27 missed games this season - after he had missed six of 274 games in his first three NBA seasons - had nothing to do with the post-lockout schedule.
Sean Hurwitz, 43, paid around $1,600 for his personal return last year. But he has no complaints.
But thanks to English, Pressey (seven first-half assists) and the Tech turnover spree that included 14 in the first half, MU labored to a 31-24 halftime lead.
Midway through the first school year, several of the teachers and staff members left Cultural Arts out of frustration, they said.

The Democrats' choice of North Carolina does look a bit overconfident at this point, but six months from now it is likely to be forgotten, either because Obama somehow manages a comeback or because there are by then so many more vivid examples.
Tyson Chandler, Baron Davis and Landry Fields will all be in the starting lineup as the Knicks attempt to even their first-round Eastern Conference Playoff series with the Heat at a game apiece tonight in Miami. According to multiple reports, Chandler, who was severely limited by the flu in Game 1, and Davis, who has a sore back, are feeling good enough to try again in Game 2. Fields will replace rookie guard Iman Shumpert, who tore his ACL in Saturday's 100-67 loss to the Heat.
The Roseland, N.J., company held its annual meeting Nov. 8, and Butler was re-elected by shareholders to a one-year term on the company’s board of directors. The next day, ADP said the 65-year-old executive had retired after 37 years with the company.
I could fit in only lunch at Lemongrass, a contemporary Thai restaurant from Bangkok chef Krairit Krairavee. Though the crowd was almost entirely Asian, I'd been cautioned that it sometimes tend to be on the mild side and to ask for my food Thai-style. Our Thai waiter took me at my word, suggesting dishes and asking how spicy we could take it. Seven was water-gulping hot, just how I like it. Grilled beef salad, thick fingers of rare beef with shallots, lime and chile could wake up any sleepy-headed gambler. Softshell crab salad weaves the flavors of crab, celery, lime, lemongrass garlic and chile into a beautiful composition. Rice noodles with squid, shrimp and scallops is less compelling. I loved that I felt so far away, eating such distinctive Thai food in such a smart setting. To cool down, have some young coconut juice from the shell or one of the shaved ices in exotic flavors.
The goal when the GOP meets Aug. 27 in Tampa, Fla., is four scripted days of television that play like a campaign commercial for the nominee, not a reality show full of squabbling factions.
Oh, gawd. I'm tired of all the Tebow fans. The Broncos' games of last season were snoozers in the first half highlighted with wretched quarterback play. I was going to cancel my NFL Ticket subscription because last year stunk, just like the QB. Please, people, keep your faith separate from your judgment. Just because Tebow told everyone he loved Jesus does not make him a good quarterback. By the way, I prayed to God the Broncos got Manning. Thank you, Jesus!
Goldstein's top 11 is very similar to the top 10 I help put together for Baseball America -- if, that is, you allow me to exclude the players not eligible for Goldstein's list because they appeared in the majors already:

Tax receipts have fallen 13.8 percent this fiscal year and show no signs of rebounding anytime soon, what with about 250,000 Missourians out of work. Fewer people working means fewer people paying income taxes and buying goods that trigger sales taxes, sources that make up 90 percent of state tax collections.
The left-handed hitting Damon, 38, has put together a fine career in his previous 17 major league seasons.
"It is far more important that the work is done thoroughly and that the recommendation are sound," he said. "The only reason timing is important is because of the political calendar. If you have a reason for an arbitrary deadline based in policy, I challenge you to articulate it."

tallying the total number of stories that mentioned the storm by name, dividing by the average number of stories per day that were available in the database, and multiplying by 10, he came up with "News Units" (essentially representing one-tenth of all the stories published on a given day) for each cyclone. Irene ranked 10th with a score of 2.25 News Units. Silver says that that's about right, since Irene was the 11th most deadly storm (based on a death count of 21 at the time he crunched the numbers; with more than 40 deaths now reported, it has moved into the top four), and the eight most economically destructive based on an estimate of $14 billion in damages.
øNASCAR vice president of competition Robin Pemberton was steadfast about two things: Stewart's No. 14 Chevrolet was the leader, and Edwards jumped the restart. "All of the above," he reiterated.

"Heirloom" is a vague term associated with many different tomatoes. It's applied mostly to self-pollinated non-hybrid varieties that have grown true to type for 40 years or more. (In England, they're called heritage tomatoes.) A benefit of growing heirlooms: Their seed will grow the same kind of tomatoes next year.
Yeah, I don’t think laser ever works 100 percent. It takes a lot of visits for you to really start noticing a difference. Shaving is fine so long as you have the right products and proper routine. Get yourself a nice loofa mitt, Dove soap (the original), two shaving gels: Skintimate Skin Therapy Gel with vitamin E (dry skin, pink bottle) and Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel with oatmeal (baby blue bottle). Use one for a week, then switch to the other for another week and see which one works best for your skin.

Though wine grapes have been grown in the area since the late 1800s, the region has been slow to develop a reputation as a fine-wine appellation. This identity crisis has nothing to do with Suisun Valley's topography and climate, the quality of its grapes or the nature of its wines.

Joy and praise were woven throughout Easter services, Masses and gatherings across San Diego County on Sunday as families and friends joined to celebrate from sunrise to sunset.
Breyer's opposite number among the court's conservatives, Scalia is similarly talkative and is ranked the second most vocal by Johnson. Often pithy, biting or witty, Scalia is known to bring chuckles from courtroom observers and the lawyers—and maybe even the justices themselves. From his seat on left side of the bench, Scalia won't hesitate to verbally scorch a lawyer or another justice he disagrees with by calling their remarks "absurd" or "ridiculous."
I usually found it difficult to communicate with most of them; even when I was a young sprig stemming from the same sapling (which eventually grew into a tall sturdy tree with limbs hefty enough to handle the weight of added nooses).
"When you think of children in poverty or economic indicators, you know how the stock market did yesterday," Krackov said. "In some cases the most recent data we have is from 2010, and we have to use what we have."
Giuliani's televised news conferences and other actions after the Sept. 11 attacks helped him build an image as a cool and competent manager who counseled a frightened nation through unimaginable loss. That image has spurred his rise in surveys of Republican voters, acting as a counterbalance to his liberal positions on abortion, gay rights and other social issues, which typically disqualify a candidate in the eyes of conservatives.
More than 20 years ago, the music critic John Rockwell described Ben Johnston in the New York Times as "one of the best nonfamous composers this country has to offer." What has changed is that Johnston is now, I'd suggest, our best nonfamous composer.
I think my love for the series really peaked at “Mega Man II.” You can imagine my excitement when I found out this title was just $.99 for the full version on the AppStore. Something about “Mega Man” was just enthralling. I don’t know if it was the difficulty, the creative levels or just all the cool variations “Mega Man” had. Basically think of any combination of two colors, and at some point, Mega Man got to wear a suit in that palette which also gave you a cool weapon stolen from a defeated boss.
Wintergreen Resort in Wintergreen, Va., continues to add snow guns to make sure your trails have plenty of the white stuff, and they're sprucing up the Shamokin outdoor ice skating rink.

We've been advising parents for a long time not to automatically give their kids antibiotics for ear infections, the flu and bronchitis (all of which are usually caused by viruses). Antibiotics are designed to knock out bacterial infections, not viruses. And yet more than 50 million unnecessary and ineffective prescriptions for antibiotics are written to "treat" common viral infections every year in North America. And misuse only worsens the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Adam Baker, who worked in apparel at both companies, says the Goliath is well aware of Under Armour's potential, and even had someone on staff, while he worked there in 2003, whose job was to watch its every move. Nike denies that such a position exists today. Leaving Nike for Under Armour as he did, Baker says, was seen as going to "the dark side."

Without a full complement of staff, council could not offer the transparency it does, with meetings live-streamed and pending legislation posted online, Miller said. And council would have to rely too heavily on FitzGerald's staff, becoming a proverbial rubber stamp.

A deeply disturbing report released last week by the Minnesota Office of the Legislative Auditor suggests that there have indeed been forces of destruction at work involving the Gang Strike Force. But the auditor's damning findings only lead to one conclusion: The forces undermining this valuable agency have come from within. Its real enemies were its longtime commander, advisory board members and officers who allowed the agency to deteriorate into frightening and shameful levels of dysfunction. The Strike Force imploded on their watch.

"It looks like things are turning around,'' he said. "I'm keeping my fingers crossed.''
A common criticism of Calipari has been that all the great recruiting he's done over the years has never translated into a national title. He's come close, reaching the NCAA semifinals with Massachusetts in 1996, the championship game with Memphis in 2008 (both of those results were later vacated by the NCAA, although Calipari was not implicated) and the Final Four last season.
All of the infielders are missing at least one of their legs. Two of the outfielders use those special carbon-fiber running legs, the ones that look like upside-down question marks, for speed. One outfielder is missing a hand, and the right-fielder plays without his entire left arm and shoulder.

The Boy of the title - played with disarming unself-consciousness by James Rolleston - is a fantasy-prone preteen who lives with his younger brother, Rocky (Te Aho Eketone-Whitu), their grandma, and a goat in the ridiculously picturesque Waihau Bay. His dad (Waititi) is just out from a long stint in jail, and arrives home with a couple of numskull sidekicks to be greeted by the kids he doesn't know, and who don't know him. In fact, Boy has been spinning elaborate fantasy scenarios about his incarcerated pop, imagining him as a globe-trotting action hero. The reality is sorely different, and the source of considerable inner conflict.

According to the draft pick value chart, it's a match made in war-room heaven: 1,090 points (640 for No. 29 and 450 for No. 45) to 1,100 points for No. 14. (And just so we're clear, the chart isn't perfect, as the Eagles swap with the Chargers in 2003 was 904 points for Philly's picks to 1,050 for San Diego's pick. What a trade for the Eagles -- until they took McDougle.)

As chairman, Mr. Wamser was quotable. When it took 51 hours to count results of an election with a big write-in vote in 1983, he compared the ordeal to a "three-day tooth extraction." In 1989, he asked a judge to delay a primary because of a snowstorm, saying the election board "didn't want to be the source of 200 broken hips." The judge refused.
At issue is an agreement hammered out late last year between the sports authority and the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association to take over the operations of the 65-year-old track in Oceanport — which had been facing a shutdown if no deal was reached.
If you want truly authentic wood fired oven pizza, it's Crostata's on Bishop Rd and Highland Rd. in Highland Hts. I wish I could underline " authentic ", pepperoni is not on the menu as a topping. And the home made sausage, the best you will ever eat. A hint of red wine in it, fantastic. This is a place where one can sit and eat 3 pizzas. Not heavy, but airy, thin dough. But not cracker-like.
God had a lot to say about marriage. Most specifically, in the beginning, God created humans as male and female. Adam looked at Eve and acknowledged that she was bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh and declared that a man would leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they would be one flesh. Jesus confirmed these words and stated that the only reason why Moses allowed divorce was because of the hardness of our hearts. In other words, the principle of one man and one woman is the Biblical definition of marriage and anything else results from our hard, sinful hearts.
In Saturday's Star Tribune, we also learned from hockey writer Michael Russo that the Wild was set to become the lowest-scoring team in the NHL since the 2004-05 lockout. The significance of that is that the NHL, in addition to adding shootouts, declared that it would open up the game with a crackdown on interference and other changes.

Baseball America went beyond the sum totals of bonuses spent on draft to illustrate how willing certain teams are to go above slot or to use the slot system to their big-pocketbook benefit. Each draft, the commissioner's office offers suggest bonuses for each spot in the drafts. These are called "slot", and they are informal -- though there is constant chatter about making them mandatory. And each draft there are players who fall because they are expected to command "above slot." Rick Porcello was one several years ago. Austin Wilson, the Cardinals' 12th-round pick this past draft, fell not only because of his commitment to Stanford but also, partially, because of the perception of what it would take to buy him out of that commitment. Cox, a sophomore-eligible player, is believed by some to have been available at No. 25 to the Cardinals because of the bonus (including a major-league contract) that he sought.

I like to serve this cake with molasses-enhanced whipped cream. To make it, whip 1 cup of chilled, heavy whipping cream with 1 tablespoon powdered sugar until stiff, then gently fold in 1 tablespoon molasses (some streaks of molasses will be visible). It is also delicious served with ice cream. If you prefer to use frozen blueberries, add 5 to 10 minutes of baking time because the cold berries slow down the process.
But at least one mainstream retailer will highlight the idea that the pantsuit can be worn as separates. At Saks in coming months, shoppers can expect to find multihued jackets hung separately from the bold matching pants and interspersed with solid items. There will be more busy pants than busy jackets. "There may be women who wear it head-to-toe—very daring," says Saks's Ms. Sherin. But "for us, it's probably about the patterned pant."

It's hard to pinpoint what about David Sedaris' writing is so brilliant, so funny, so adored. Some would argue for his eccentric upbringing, and their favorite essays offer glimpses of his siblings and parents at junctures of familial madness.

The Sandra Day O'Connor Courthouse, 401 W. Washington St., was dedicated in October 2000. The most striking feature of the six-story building is its enormous glass atrium, which creates a greenhouse look for the side facing Washington Street. The 560,000-square-foot building occupies a parcel stretching from Fourth to Sixth avenues. The acres of glass covering its entire height and length are thick, tempered glass that meet security needs. The rest of the building, although presenting a glassy facade, is mostly concrete and painted steel. The builder of the $112.5 million courthouse was New York architect Richard Meier.

No longer does the Census Bureau ask people to fill out a long form as part of the decennial Census. One out of six households used to get that survey.
As for the Netflix and iTunes questions, Netflix wouldn't work because Netflix doesn't sell or download movie files at all. It only streams movies to computers running the Netflix website or mobile devices running the Netflix app. And you wouldn't need AirStash to view a Netflix movie on, say, an iPad, because the latter can receive them directly via the app.

Skillfully mixing archival film footage with staged reenactments, the movie opens with a subtle teaser that makes us think we could be watching foreign agents on their way to wreaking havoc on Manhattan's twin totems of American capitalism. Instead, we're witnessing how Petit, an artist-provocateur unknowingly used many of the same methods that the Sept. 11 hijackers would 27 years later (surveillance, self-disguise) but to create rather than destroy.
Jimenez explained that he moved toward Tulowitzki in an aggressive manner because the shortstop insulted him. However, Jimenez appeared to already be heading toward the plate and throwing his glove onto the ground before Tulowitzki screamed in his direction.

The date was June 9, 1967, and I had my own "Summer of Love" going at Wrigley Field. My family lived in an old Victorian on Hawthorne Place, a leafy street a mere seven blocks from the Friendly Confines, so close that we could sometimes hear the crowd roar. In exchange for completing two or three modest chores (OK, two), my mother, the late Joanne Alter, packed me a brown bag lunch and gave me around $2, which came out to $1 for admission to the bleachers, 25 cents for a Frosty Malt frozen dessert and an extra 75 cents that was supposed to be only for emergencies but often got accidentally spent at either Tony's Hot Dogs near Broadway and Cornelia or for a late-afternoon snow cone on Addison.

St. Louis-area casinos on the Missouri side are exempt from the new smoking ban there.
Buck didn't immediately concede.
But there was a nervous undercurrent. Boxer hasn't lost an election since a 1972 run for the Marin County Board of Supervisors, but she hasn't been able to break clear of her GOP opponent, Carly Fiorina. The crowd was loud but didn't fill the room, and no one was clamoring to get in.

Veteran quarterbacks accept caddy duties more easily when the organization makes the roles clear to everyone involved. One of those indicators is draft status, because it represents the size of the investment. It's not everything. But Wallace knows Weeden isn't coming to sit, certainly not for long anyway at age 28.
You'll know how fast the front office thinks it can win when you see what it's able to do with Garza's contract - or not do. Lock him up with a long-term deal - something that got more complicated when the San Francisco Giants signed right-hander Matt Cain to a five-year, $112.5 million extension a few weeks ago - and the push is on.

After the first lawsuit was filed in September, the council agreed to replace the Lord's Prayer with a moment of silence.

But despite all of that, James said he was ignoring all the jockeying by teams hoping to make him and fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade a pitch.
Even more surprising was the complete lack of “show” from Disney’s renowned storytellers. For most of the dinner service, the screens served as little more than atmospheric, animated aquariums with the occasional sight gag floating past. The entire production was largely unintrusive until the finale, when the waiters forced everyone to participate in a Crush-led, dude-a-thon sing-a-long that quickly became annoying. The whole experience was a letdown for me.
