What's so sexy about them is the tete-a-tete.

While Wilkinson, 34, has remained steadfast in his doctrinal beliefs, he said some of his decisions made on and off the field in 2008 were mistakes.

Think about that. College is perhaps the sole endeavor that is virtually free of buyer's remorse. I've had friends who regret the marriages they entered into, the jobs they accepted and the cars they bought. Heck, I've even read stories about people who regretted their purchases of lottery tickets that won them millions. People regret decisions and purchases big and small -- from lunch orders to haircuts to their homes. But not college degrees.

There was no government reaction in Beijing to Google's announcement Tuesday, which said the company was dismayed by hacking attacks launched from within China. Google said the attacks were apparently designed to break into the computers of U.S. companies and gather information about human rights activists.
It was a miserable game, with the Bears trailing 13-6 in the fourth quarter. And an irate Ditka, steaming at Flutie on the sideline, took over the game. You could see the transference of Ditka's ire through the face of a mesmerized Steve Fuller, who was signaling plays from the sideline to Flutie in the huddle. The Bears ran seven consecutive times to score the tying touchdown, got the ball back, then ran eight times in 10 plays to set up Kevin Butler's winning field goal as time ran out.
NEW ORLEANS -- The head of AT&T's wireless business says he's looking to introduce plans that share a data allowance among family members, similar to the way it sells family calling plans.

The new laws ban future part-time workers from the pension system, instead requiring part-timers who make more than $5,000 to join a 401(k)-style plan. It also makes pensions for future hires less generous, rolling back a 9 percent increase granted in 2001, requires pension payments to be based on one job, and limits payments of accrued sick leave for future workers to $15,000. The bills do not affect those already retired.

Really, Hall chose Martin, the fiery coach he said reminded him of Jefferson’s Lawrence (Bud) Pollard for his penchant to get into his players’ faces and drag the best out of them. He wanted a coach who would push him and felt a bond with Martin after spending time with him at Jefferson.
Comment From Tackleberry: The offense may not have a ton of talent but Shurmur has been unable to make the most of the skillset of these players. I just don't see how he comes back.

The basic recipe is simply good-quality ground meat, milk, breadcrumbs, onions, salt, pepper -- and allspice, the flavor that sets them apart. Fendert also recalls that his grandmother used to add soda water to her meatballs, a trick that translates into a crispy coating when the meatballs are cooked. Swedish meatballs are traditionally served with brown pan gravy, sweet lingonberries and boiled potatoes.

Still, it has been awhile since she has had a Top 10 hit. Part of that is her own doing, and the inevitable result of the inward turn her writing has taken. After topping the Billboard charts 10 times in the ’80s and ’90s with songs such as “Miss You Much” and “Love Will Never Do (Without You),” Jackson turned her attention to more personal and intimate subject matter. Her interest in sexual exploration — always a recurring theme in her music — began to dominate her albums, and her production grew more adventurous, electronic and indebted to offbeat hip-hop.
"You have to keep them happy or, if not, they will find someplace else that will," said Michele Starkey, Burnsville's senior center coordinator.
Strength/weakness: The Aggies are an aggressive bunch as evidenced by their 1,048 free-throw attempts and they average 78.5 points a game, which ranks 11th nationally.

“I find that when they go to any hospital other than Hagedorn it’s almost like they’re starting over, because they (the hospitals) are so large there’s no continuity of care,” she said. “At Hagedorn, they’re treated as individuals.

ZURICH—Swiss drug maker Novartis AG said Tuesday that net profit declined 16.6% in the first quarter, hit by stagnant revenue as new products were unable to fully compensate for weaker sales of blockbuster Diovan.
Many economists say it will take at least until the middle of this decade for the situation to get back to normal, meaning a jobless rate of 5.5 percent to 6 percent. It will also take years for the economy to recover the 8.4 million jobs wiped out by the recession, they say.

Hugo is obsessed with a clockwork-driven mechanical man left behind by his father. In his quest to unlock the automaton's secret, his story becomes entangled with the true-life tale of Belle Époque magician-turned-film visionary George Méliès, an early innovator of cinematic special effects like time-lapse photography, stop motion and hand-painted colors, and who wrote, directed, acted in, produced and designed hundreds of films in his glass studio before falling into obscurity after World War I.

Morris said he did his best with all the caricatures but felt more pressure with the better-known stars. "Like with Madonna, if her lips weren't right, everybody would know it.

It's a hip, bright spot in a city that narrowly avoided a state takeover last week when Mayor Dave Bing, the City Council and Gov. Rick Snyder agreed on a deal giving the state input on Detroit's finances and long-term fiscal restructuring. The city's budget deficit is about $200 million. Long-term structural debt is slightly more than $13 billion, and the city's unemployment rate is among the highest in the country.

Holiday and Turner continue to befuddle coach Doug Collins with their inconsistency. The under-25 starting backcourt followed a solid Game 3 with a combined 3 for 22 for eight points in the first half. Lou Williams, perhaps the league's top reserve, failed to bail them out with a 2-for-10 effort in the game.

When I started I said three years from now we're going to be bigger than Nike. And not many people believed me. Two years later we were bigger than Nike and three years later we were 15 percent bigger than Nike. So it was a big swing in three years. And with that I was a big player in the industry. I was a big fish in a small pond if you'd like.

Titanic theorists seeking to explain how a glancing blow by a chunk of ice could have destroyed the mightiest ship on the ocean focused for many years on something called the “brittle steel” theory.

The script: The slippage at OSU has been precipitous: a program that led the nation in run defense in 2007, allowing just 70.6 yards per game, was last in the Pac-12 and 101st nationally in 2011 at 196.8 yards per game. Part of the blame is on a defensive line that has to get better. Or else. Coach Mike Riley thinks he has good talent – especially on the flanks – and he hopes potential turns into performance at defensive tackle. “We’ve got some young guys who haven’t played yet, and we’re looking for big things from them,’’ said Riley, who is excited about the growth of back-up left end Devon Kell and the athleticism of players such as Brandon Bennett-Jackson, Desmond Collins, and Lavonte Barnett.

Two years ago, when I entered this chamber for the first time, the fiscal condition of our state was as dire as it had been for decades. Hope was low. Pessimism seemed like a permanent state of mind.

Cooking methods - whether including high-heat grilling or lower temperature barbecuing- also affect the wine choices. Traditionalists swear by charcoal or hardwood for both grilling and barbecue, especially for that smoky nuance.

Back story: Wagner has been on a team of some sort since she started swimming and doing gymnastics in third grade. In high school she played volleyball and basketball and competed in the shot put and discus. She played volleyball all four years in college. A veteran of half-ironman triathlons, she says she'd still be doing them if she had the time and the training partners. That's a 1.2-mile swim followed by a 56-mile bike ride and a half-marathon.
Some economists doubt consumers can keep it up. They probably can't afford to. Americans' after-tax income in the first three months rose just 0.6% from a year earlier. That was the skimpiest pay increase in two years. People spent more, in part, because they saved less. Economists worry that people won't keep spending more unless their incomes grow.
øWhen DC relaunched its superhero books last fall, a JSA title wasn't in the first wave - Robinson instead had more time to work out Earth 2 and craft a book that featured a whole heap of alternate heroes, the main ones being Jay Garrick, the Flash, and Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern. (Plus, Robinson says, it would be better to spring a new Earth on new comic readers after getting used to the main Earth.)

Increasingly, the true work in Congress is performed not by committees with expertise on the issues considered, but rather by party leadership simply pursuing a partisan agenda. It is a system where committee members and rank-and-file members are increasingly irrelevant in every stage of legislating except the very last stage: voting. And that voting, on major and controversial measures, is typically along party lines.

At a time when most mail took three weeks or longer to travel the nearly 2,000 miles from Missouri to California, the relaying Pony riders could do it in 10 days, sometimes less. And they always started in St. Joe.

Yet Eno, who is now 63, produced a mountain of great work from 1971 to 1977; more than three decades later, his music from those years still sounds audaciously forward-looking. Watch the new DVD documentary “Brian Eno — 1971-1977: The Man Who Fell to Earth” ($19.95, Sexy Intellectual/Chrome Dreams) — more than 2½ hours devoted to just those years — and you’ll have no doubt: Brian Eno expanded the boundaries of rock ’n’ roll as few people have, before or since.

Let's hear it for what it really is: high-style, contemporary American soul food. The Zanzibar role is most noticeable in an occasional carved African animal likeness tucked sweetly into the dark, spare, elegant d cor. Perhaps more "fusion" will come in time, but for now the Southern influence gets top billing, deservedly so.
In the current parlance of astronomers, however, Vesta and Ceres, like Pluto, are dwarf planets, not planets. The definition of planet, set by the International Astronomical Union, takes into account size and appearance, and requires that a planet be the gravitational bully in its orbit.

REAL DEAL: The $5 lunch is mostly an artifact from another era, tricky to come by even at taquerias and hot dog stands. Not so at Pastini Pastaria, the successful homegrown chain specializing in mainstream Italian favorites.

The deal required no financing, so there are no payments or interest while the state waits out the market.

Mexico City: Yes, the Mexican capital is a noisy, congested, chaotic place where you should steer clear of those green and white VW Beetle taxis (some engage in kidnapping) and watch your back at ATMs. But it's also the hemisphere's biggest, oldest, most historic metropolis, a bottomless trove of superb art museums, genteel parks, excellent restaurants.

The pain that comes with the couple's separation provides the film's most moving scenes, with the actors finally revealing some of the clearly devoted pair's pent-up emotions.

Cressman noted that the Mercury News found the percentage of sponsored bills has increased in recent years, even though the Legislature already has enacted a series of increasingly tighter limits on the number of bills each lawmaker can introduce.

I don't think my son will be able to walk down the street at night. I can understand how this can confuse people. Criminals tend not to work during the day, so at night all of the innocent people need to be in the house. I can remember a women's group tried to get me to go to a "Take Back the Night" rally when I was in college. I told the nice ladies that as long as I can move around during the day, the criminals can have the night. They still can. There are murderers with guns that kill children on the street at night. There are police that won't protect children on the streets at night. I will tell my son that he can walk down the street during the day, but he should not walk down the street at night.

Hughes built an early cushion Tuesday by taking Washington and Clackamas counties, but results dribbling in from Multnomah County, Stacey's stronghold, steadily ate away at his lead Wednesday. At 8 p.m., fewer than 1,000 votes separated the men out of more than 370,000 cast.

Just two nights before, she was telling me how much she loved me. I kept pushing her away. She ended up with a bruised butt where she landed on the floor and a sprained wrist.

The EPA, perhaps more than any other agency, has found itself in the GOP's crosshairs over its regulation of the gases blamed for global warming, steps it has taken to limit air pollution from coal-fired power plants, and its increased regulation of fracking, which is responsible for a gas drilling boom.

And for those who claim that this is bad for growth and bad for small businesses, let me remind you that with those tax rates in place, this country created 22 million jobs, raised incomes, and had the largest surplus in history.

Naturally, it hasn't taken long for such a salacious incident to pique the interest of Washington's favorite scandal-chaser, House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, who rarely backs away from an opportunity to score political points.

Saturday was a sad turn of events for not just the franchise’s present but its future, with Shumpert tearing the ACL and meniscus in his left knee. He is expected to be sidelined six to eight months... If he returns in six months, he would be coming back to the Knicks just as the preseason ends.

In a move away from traditional production shows, the new concert-style concept will feature a cast of classically trained vocalists and musicians performing a celebration of music from Motown to opera to pop and rock.
