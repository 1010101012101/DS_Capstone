What high school sports mean to me: I definitely think I am who I am as a person because of them. I'm a captain of the basketball team, and it has taught me to be decisive and affect other people. It teaches me responsibility and how to socialize with the other girls and coaches. It has also helped me go through the recruiting process and prepared me for job interviews.
But if you want a bike built for cyclo-touring -- a bit sturdier than the typical road bike, with attachment points for front and back racks and with low gearing -- you could spend $1,000 or more, or you could spend as little as a few hundred dollars for a used one. Even on a tight budget, Thalheimer recommends springing for a good bike fit. Comfort is key.

The superstar thing works; history doesn't lie. Before the '04 Pistons, you have to go all the way back to the 1979 Seattle SuperSonics to find a champion that didn't have an all-world player.

Winning a Nobel Peace Prize doesn't guarantee you're a good person, and Hagerty's accounts contain enough detail to make me suspect he was at least less than a complete gentleman.

Speaking of coffee, let's talk about the atmosphere. The sidewalk seating, with its umbrellas and people watching, nails it. (Well, our sidewalks are cleaner. Probably a good break from authenticity there.) But inside, there is a sterility of a TV-set coffeehouse. New Orleans is gritty. The dining room needs a little attitude. And it doesn't need a souvenir stand with overpriced trinkets. Seriously, the French Quarter tourist traps are not the part of New Orleans you want to emulate.

Economic drivers: Inexpensive real estate seized from the state's failed savings and loans and sold to developers by the Resolution Trust Corp. in the early years of the decade set the stage for the unprecedented residential growth that would take place over the next 15 years. Communities such as DC Ranch, Kierland, Anthem, and Arrowhead Ranch were launched in the 1990s. Arizona's chip-making business got a boost in the 1990s with Intel Corp.'s first fabrication plant in Chandler, which created 4,000 jobs and set the stage for further expansions by the company.

My own story is part of that identity. I was born in Moscow in 1992, the year after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. I came to the U.S. when I was 7 and hold joint Russian-American citizenship. My mom and I go back every year. Usually, we go to Moscow to visit friends and to Khabarovsk to visit my grandfather. When I was little we'd go during the winter, when temperatures can drop to minus-70 degrees. But now that my grandfather's health is worse, we go during the summer because we have more time with him.
"It's not like we sat on our hands waiting for a good day of sunshine," said board member Wayne Thompson (a member of The Oregonian's editorial board before he retired). The nine board members worked their networks, trying to come up with the money, but most companies had already budgeted their 2009 arts sponsorship dollars by the time the Portland festival approached them. A few times, Thompson thought that a grant, a sponsorship or some other funding source was about to come through ... only to be disappointed.

Isn't there a middle way? California does not have to go through another expensive double primary to be heard at the ballot box. Nor do we have to try to have the first-in-the-nation vote, jumping ahead of Iowa, New Hampshire and the rest. There's no reason that California couldn't combine its legislative primary and its presidential primary on Super Tuesday in 2016 — giving Republicans and Democrats a chance to name their nominee. If Californians without big checkbooks don't like sitting on the sidelines until the game is virtually over, they should say so, loudly and clearly, to their parties.

1. Doug Fister returns tonight after missing the entire season since his first start on April 7 against the Red Sox. Some people are probably overstating the importance of this move. But think about what this does. It quickly allows manager Jim Leyland to run his starting rotation the way he wants to for the first time all season. No more Adam Wilk (for now). No more spot starts scheduled for Duane Below (for now). Assuming the five guys stay healthy, Leyland can now construct and run his pitching staff the same way he intended to do it back in April (minus the injured Daniel Schlereth).

Ice application for 15-20 minutes. This is particularly useful during the first 24 hours after injury in reducing the degree of swelling that may otherwise occur, although, unfortunately, ice isn't expected to reduce swelling that is already present.

Experts say no reliable figures exist that could show whether public sector workers retire younger than their private-sector counterparts. That's because the Bureau of Labor Statistics has no way of defining "retirement," and nearly all analyses involving the American workforce begin with the bureau's data.
We're all angry and for so many reasons. But unlike a lot of disgruntled voices, I'm not mad because the government lawyers spent all this money on a so-called witch hunt. No, I'm furious because the government apparently put a bunch of amateurs in charge of legitimate perjury cases, and wasted taxpayers' money by blowing the highly publicized pursuits of Barry Bonds and now Clemens. And the best they can show for it is a lightweight conviction on only one count (Bonds) in one trial and a mistrial in the other (Clemens).

So, soaked from head to toe and without a change of clothes. I jumped onto the barge piloted by Jim Sjulin that was to follow our crew around the island. Yes, it hurt not to be out there with the kayak crew as the winds picked up and the rains pelted the Willamette. I found some comfort in the fact that my cabin mates, the hospitable Peg Malloy and Gay Greger, found me a dry shirt and jacket -- and built a fire in the boat's small wood stove after giving me a cup of coffee and a croissant.

The NFL draft is very similar to an election — the early returns don’t mean much, and only time will tell. That’s really a shame, because all of the postdraft evaluations give the Eagles extremely high marks. Mel Kiper Jr. (I know his hair is bizarre, but he knows his stuff) rated the Eagles and Tampa Bay as having done the best. Our own Daily News football guru, Paul Domowitch, gave an “A” to only three teams’ drafts — the Bucs, Colts and Birds.

“Just from watching Shea from my perspective, he’s just a guy that was always around the ball, always in the backfield,” Forsey said. “One of the things you hear, he is a high-motor guy going 100 mph, he’s just a playmaker. He’s versatile, he’s quick, one of those hard workers that really fit the Boise State program. That’s kind of what they pride themselves on, taking guys that aren’t necessarily the highest recruit out of high school and molding them to how they fit their program. I think the Bears will be excited about Shea. He’s a hard worker. Throughout all of his time at Boise State, he’s always been productive. I think that will continue at the next level.

Everything Fox produces has perfect pitch. Fried Padron peppers are blistered and browned, doused with lime and sea salt; it's a simple yet amazing dish for $4. At the other extreme is cauliflower in a cast-iron pot ($12), a blend of roasted cauliflower bound with a cauliflower puree and topped with shavings of the raw vegetable; the three treatments show how a great chef can coax totally different qualities from the same ingredients.
"This means that Afghan security forces operating under Afghan law will now be responsible for capturing and detaining the terrorists who try to kill and wound the innocent people of Afghanistan every day," added Allen, who signed the pact along with Afghan Defense Minister Gen.

The National Institutes of Health says it remains unclear what role dietary soy or soy isoflavone might play in cancer risk. While several large population studies have reported that higher soy intake is associated with a decreased risk of developing various types of cancers, including breast, prostate and colon cancer, other research suggests soy does not have this effect.
Let's face it, Mitt Romney seems more than a little opaque. On the one hand he's über-rich, incredibly smart and nakedly ambitious; on the other he seems somehow robotic, shut-down and so happy to embrace the pragmatic option that the core of his character remains elusive. There's a sense of a man who will eagerly deny even his own best achievements if doing so will help him seize the brass ring. Is he inauthentic or merely trying to find that area known as the common ground?

Now, about that asterisk. I saw "The Avengers" in 3-D at a screening in Hollywood at the ArcLight, a multiplex known for excellent projection. As soon as the opening credits hit the screen it was obvious that something was wrong; the images were dim and badly out of register. I should have known that the problem was a dead battery in my glasses, since the same thing had happened—in a different theater—during last year's disastrous screening of "Clash of the Titans." Instead, I sat there stewing with frustration, and assuming the projection was to blame, since a couple of friends who'd come with me were having the same problem. One of them went out to complain, but nothing happened. A few minutes later he went out again and returned with replacement glasses for himself, his wife and me. Someone had told him the glasses were the culprit, but those batteries were dead too.

True, there were layers of chips and cheese and crema. But she began by making a dark, rich and pungent mole, then adding layers of cooked chicken and spinach.

Everyone laughed. It was just one sample today from the 68 minutes Manning sat in front of cameras on Super Bowl media day — and yes, I endured every last second with him.

That's when University of Akron electrical engineering student William "Wes" Schake had his "Project Runway" moment. Why not design a Goldilocks coat, one that wasn't too hot or too cold, but just right for changing conditions?

There's nothing official about greatness, no box you check to complete the deal. Greatness isn't a parking garage, with a ticket that can be validated only by cutting down the net on the season's final Monday. Greatness is greatness, and there are many ways to achieve it."

The commission doesn't care. They were going to take a no-confidence vote but realized at the last minute there was a non-nepotism clause included and darn sure didn't want to open that Pandora's box. The state doesn't act because they don't give two hoots about local politics. At least President Barack Obama makes a stand and doesn't invite Ficano to his fund-raiser.

* And a follow-up note to the cynics: please don't compare this to the Cardinals having Stan Musial, 91, appear in the golf cart at Busch Stadium on special occasions. The Man certainly feels the impact of advancing age, but he wants to be there, with his people. I only say this because I usually receive e-mails after every Stan the Man ceremony at Busch, with people suggesting that he's too feeble to do it, and the Cardinals should leave him be. Well, rubbish to that. Musial's friends and family say these trips to Busch get Stan fired up, and that's good for him. Musial isn't a boxer or some random entertainer with star cachet; he is St. Louis baseball. Cardinals fans and Musial have a remarkable personal connection that's powerful and 100 percent genuine. It's lasted for more than seven decades. It will last until the day he passes. (Actually the bond will last beyond that.) Musial is the franchise icon. And with the fan base getting rocked by Albert Pujols' abrupt departure for a money grab, Musial is more prominent and beloved than ever.

In time, you will cure him of what I prefer to call "high self-esteem seizures" at your house, but this is going to be an uphill battle. Stay the course. Your resolve will eventually pay off.

MS interrupts the flow of information between the brain and the body and can stop people from moving. For some, this means living with unpredictable symptoms that can come and go, like numbness and blurred vision. For others, there is more permanent damage, like paralysis.

Others will ask: well, suppose Bradford doesn't develop? Then what? Wouldn't you want to have Tebow in place? I agree that there's pressure on Bradford to play well in 2012. (It might help if the Rams got him a receiver or two.) But even if Bradford doesn't play well, you're assuming that Fisher/Snead would view Tebow as a long-term alternative and solution. And that's a huge leap. That's assuming an awful lot. And I'd politely suggest that the assumption would be incorrect. The Rams don't view Tebow as a franchise QB. Most teams don't.

Maybe there is no such thing as a reticent warrior. How could there be, when your own life hangs in the balance? I am grateful for the brave men and women who have no say in the battles they wage.

Running, battling and gritting out every possession. Nagbe has the kind of talent I don't believe we have ever seen in Timbers green since I've become a supporter. Once he realizes his gifts and develops a nasty streak, I think he'll become an absolute assassin on the pitch.
