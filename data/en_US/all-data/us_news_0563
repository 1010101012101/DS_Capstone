On tonight's episode of Smackdown, Cesaro made his WWE television in-ring debut, defeating Tyson Kidd in a "tryout" match. When I heard the spoilers for this contest, I thought Kidd would make a great first opponent for Cesaro, and I was proved right.

Unions and others had little trouble gathering more than 900,000 signatures to authorize a recall election for Wisconsin's governor. Finding a suitably pro-union candidate to take on Walker has not so easy. Most unions have lined up behind former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, who has pledged to veto any state budget that doesn't reinstate collective bargaining rights.
"That thing is going to be removed," Wrone said. "It's never going to reopen."
But when they help each other get through the police academy, they become best buds. And being, as the captain in charge (Ice Cube) puts it, "Justin Bieber/ Miley Cyrus-looking," they're naturals for the revival of an old program  putting baby-faced cops back into high school.
There was, throughout 2007, something for everyone to find morally reprehensible, and many a soapbox snapped under the weight of the piling on.
Ruth, in his prime, dominated baseball; Springsteen did the same with Jersey rock. And just as Ruth elevated baseball in the world’s consciousness, Springsteen did the same with the Jersey rock scene. There had been Jersey superstars before — Frank Sinatra, the Four Seasons — but none put so much of the state into their work, finding grand drama where others just saw smokestacks and suburban ennui.
But while it’s not a disaster like Kasdan’s last film, “Dreamcatcher’’ (2003), “Darling Companion’’ doesn’t amount to much more than a fairly painless way for the AARP set to spend an hour and a half watching a movie with stars their own age.

Huntsman, excluded by low poll numbers from Saturday's night's debate in Des Moines, rejoined his rivals for the first time since last month.
In a near-perfect ensemble like this one, it's hard to pick out particular singers for notice. The sad fact for altos, tenors and basses, however, is that however well they sing – and these are wonderful – if the sopranos aren't good, the lower voices are likely to go unnoticed. The sopranos – twins Helen and Kate Ashby and Rebecca Hickey – are incredibly good. Here's hoping that Cathedral Concerts will bring them all back.
ø3. Boston Bruins: While we all understand that the Stanley Cup hangover seems to have no known cure, it's still stunning that the defending Stanley Cup champions are in last place. Tim Thomas still has good numbers in net. The Bruins just need to find some goals, and a higher degree of efficiency. This is a team that feeds off its own energy.
Steak au poivre ($21.99), on the other hand, was gamy and robust, a medium rare strip steak that could rival a steakhouse best. It’s served with Cheddar-mashed potatoes, a bland version that nonetheless was piped annoyingly onto the plate with pastry-bag flourish. Substance, guys, not style.

To fill out the picture, Martelle offers vivid portraits of a handful of Detroiters. Among others, he tells the stories of a struggling black single mother, an entrepreneurial bar owner, and a couple of urban pioneers who unaccountably paid $300,000 for a two-bedroom condo in the once-elegant, half-deserted neighborhood of Brush Park. (The condo is now worth considerably less, he reports.)

In the northeast corner of the state, public officials faced their own water challenges. Initially, Umatilla County authorities proposed a moratorium on new home wells. That would freeze development, but telling people they couldn't have a well at home struck some as un-American.

Lots of mushrooms and epazote add substance and flavor to the cheese stuffing inside the chile relleno ($5.95), a fat, 7-inch poblano chile. This is not your basic Mission relleno. Lightly battered and fried, it sits in a light tomato sauce, criss-crossed with crema. Though it's dense, it's not at all greasy and it's very good.

Dunham succeeds in making viewers uncomfortable while proferring a new (sharp, slightly bitter) flavor of introspective female comedy. Women may eventually want the same things they've always wanted — self-respect, something approaching love/affection and sexual adventure — but first they want to analyze and make art of their personal humiliations.
As impressive as the performance is, Waters said it does not rank as his best feat in the sport. Last month, he bowled his first career left-handed 300. It came during his second week of competing lefty while his right arm healed from injury.

It isn’t often we have two of the state’s all-time top 10 facing off for a state title, but that is the case in the 5A boys’ javelin. MaCauley Garton (Mill Valley) and Tyson Holmes (Shawnee Heights) rank #3 and #10, respectively, on the A-T Kansas list with their season bests of 224’3” (2011 #2 nationally) and 211’0” (2011 #6 nationally). Holmes was upset in last week’s Seaman regional so he’ll have additional incentive to perform well this weekend. Garrett Griffin (Louisburg-4A, 3:00 p.m. Saturday) currently ranks #15 on the all-time list at 207’10” (2011 #8 nationally) and would like to become the state’s third A-T top 10 spear chucker of 2011.
So shortly after the regime fell, Salama resubmitted a script that had been rejected under Mubarak — one whose story centered on tension between Cairo's majority Muslim population and its Coptic Christian minority. But it was soon turned down for the same reasons that it had been nixed before. No such tension exists in this city, members of the board told him; where would he possibly get such an idea?

Angelato Heavenly Ice Cream, 187 Columbia Turnpike, Florham Park; (973) 295-6430. It takes chutzpah to put “heavenly” in your name, but this stylish gelateria lives up to the billing. I loved nearly all the gelati here — the dark, irresistible Death by Chocolate; the perfectly paired sea salt and caramel; and the strong, almost intense, strawberry, among others.

"So many of the votes that are taking place we knew would not pass, or would not get through the Senate," he said.

Yikes. Oh, and let's not forget the history angle. It's bad enough that Nick found some old film footage in Aunt Marie's Trailer of Weird Weaponry and Expositional Library indicating that Hitler, no less, was an evil Wesen creature. This week, he cranks up the projector for another session in the Grimm Tales of Fractured History Film Festival, and finds that the Verrat Hundjagers were aligned with the monarchists and Franco's army during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. A Grimm correspondent from back then filmed and narrates footage showing Verrat forces executing innocent Wesen.

6. The Northcutt is the Deepest -- In the Browns' only playoff appearance since their return, they lost, 36-33, in early 2003 after leading the host Steelers, 24-7, with 3 minutes, 50 seconds remaining in the third quarter. Davis ordered a prevent defense, defensive coordinator Foge Fazio challenged Davis to a fist fight then and there (not really, but he should have), and Dennis Northcutt dropped a third-down conversion right in the breadbasket from Kelly Holcomb. It would have let the Browns run out the clock.

2. Jenni “JWOWW” Farley: Due to some miscommunication, JWOWW thought she was done with interviews by the time I was brought over to her VIP table at the now closed RiNo in January 2010. Rather than roll her eyes or decline, as some celebs would, she offered me a drink and was friendly, talkative and didn’t hide how excited she was about the show’s success. When I asked what the best part about her newfound fame was, she responded: “Celebs coming up to us. Leonardo DiCaprio came up to us and said ‘GTL for life.’”

Vella said Club 35 remains open and operating as a nude juice bar, and the decision will not immediately close the business as appeals continue.

However, any basketball-only league with the current seven Catholic schools would almost certainly need to have the inclusion of the eighth Catholic school: Notre Dame. The university is a Big East member for all sports, except football — which it has famously remained independent, despite numerous pleas to join a conference. In all likelihood, Notre Dame would have to be a part of a new Big East basketball conference in order for it to succeed in terms of revenue and television contracts.

The Lakers thought they had taken control of the series with a final-minute rally to win a tight Game 4, but the Nuggets have outplayed the third-seeded Lakers for long stretches of the series. Denver was sharper and more determined from the opening tip in Game 5, while the Lakers played a disorganized, disinterested 3½ quarters until the late rally.

However, he should ensure that the study is completed in a timely manner; is based on facts, not protests and unsubstantiated fears; and does not result in unnecessary over-regulation. A proper review would also take advantage of the studies, laws, regulatory frameworks and hands-on experience in Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Texas and other states that have used fracking for years.

Maybe you have to live here to stomach the brisk brew of humor and pathos steeped in the history of people leading quiet lives of everyday courage. Our unwillingness to boast looks like a curious disease to New Yorkers, who courted LeBron with their usual chest-thumping bravado of superiority while ridiculing a Cleveland video of local celebrities singing for him to stay, please.

Michelle Williams gives a memorable, believable performance as Monroe, which is no small feat, but she doesn't transform herself into the star (a la Meryl Streep in "The Iron Lady").

Residence at Timber Pines — From second in small to second in midsize.
"The Straight Skinny" is much more rambling and scattered than the last few Lake Wobegon novels, with unfunny digressions continually sabotaging any sense of drama or clarity or pace. And like a great singer oversinging a bad song, no pun, alliteration or random ironic coincidence is beneath him. The first Guy Noir novel, unbeholden to the Lake Wobegon oeuvre, provided a perfect opportunity for Keillor to be creative, to try a new style, to be as daring as the writers he celebrates every day on "The Writer's Almanac"; perhaps he could have even written an actual noir novel.
Feinberg reaffirmed in his speech that he was reluctant to use the authority he has to "claw back" compensation at any company that received money from the $700 billion bailout program and still hasn't paid it back.

The conference is set for Thursday and Friday at the Westin Jersey City Newport.
I certainly could be wrong, but I thought one of the societal benefits to paying pensions was to get these people out of the workforce, providing employment opportunities for our youth. Time and again I see fire chiefs, school administrators, etc. retiring "to spend more time with their families," yet suddenly taking similar positions within state and municipal government sectors. Apparently, unlike with Social Security, railroad retirement and most private pensions, these individuals are allowed their overly generous pensions and a new salary (that also accrues additional pension benefits) at the same time. This has to stop!
Long, who is 83, has been singing there every Friday night for the past seven years. She never fails to pack the place. Hunter says her appeal is no mystery.

Ultimately, none of that matters. For here is the dirty little secret of the NFL draft: Every player is a might-miss. Every single one. No matter how much testing and probing and handshaking and greatness-predicting is done, it's always a roll of the dice. Until a draftee jogs onto an NFL field and is pounded by other NFL players and plays in an NFL game, there is no way to know for sure if he can play in the NFL.
DNA on the two lengths of rope found at the crime scene were consistent with DNA from Jill and Aaron LaRose, Fahnestock said.
Applying the same analysis to McCain's campaign, I like Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. He's strong in the South (and speaks with a good-old-boy accent), but he'd also be the Republicans' first non-white vice presidential candidate. He's a great speaker, and he's widely recognized in the party as a brilliant up-and-comer who people want to know. Like Sebelius, he's known in his state for reaching across the aisle to get important things done, such as his anti-corruption initiatives. He's also staunchly -- some might say insanely -- pro-life.
Wesley Matthews, one of the Blazers best players this preseason, played only four minutes before having to leave with a sore right Achilles' tendon that he first tweaked during Thursday's scrimmage in Seattle. After being pulled from the game, he immediately took off his shoe and sock and had ice placed on his heel. He did not come out of the locker room for the second half.
In addition to lack of space for necessary township equipment, including snow plows, a chipper and tractors, the current building is in need of a septic system and electric upgrade.
The potential for growth -- and longevity -- is, however, greater than they can ever realize. After rooming for a few months in a tenement on Hudson Avenue, the ambitious monk and sisters purchase the former Chambon Estates property -- and the ancient ramshackle wooden structures it comes with -- thereby establishing, with the signing of a West Hoboken deed, the first Dominican Sisters of the Perpetual Rosary monastery in the country.

He coached the Golden Eagles for eight seasons, working out of a trailer at the start and putting the building blocks together to get the program back on track. Steady improvement finally led to the team's run to the NCAA Tournament run last season. Southern Miss, picked to finish at the bottom of Conference USA, went 18-2 in one stretch and finished 25-9. The Eagles beat Memphis, New Mexico State and South Florida — all NCAA Tournament teams. And they were the only team to beat CSU at Moby Arena last season, winning 79-58.

Heckert did a masterful job during his 45-minute press conference of avoiding specifics. Asked to evaluate Oklahoma State quarterback Brandon Weeden, he said, "I'm not telling you. C'mon, I've got a draft here in a week. You want me to tell you where we've got these guys rated. There's a lot of mis-stories out there that I like right now and I want to keep a lot of them where they're at. I'm feeling pretty good about it."

One game later, he added an aggressive driving baseline dunk against Golden State. Then he scored 15 of the Blazers' first 17 points against the Los Angeles Clippers.

SAN FRANCISCO - Jim Harbaugh coaching Peyton Manning. In the Bay Area, they're beginning to think about the possibility and believe it truly might happen.
From the outset this spring, Girardi has addressed questions about things that could go wrong for the Yankees this season. Like, what if Michael Pineda is more like the pitcher he was in the second half of 2011 than the pitcher he was in the first half? Or, what if Phil Hughes’ great spring does not translate into a good regular season? Or, of more recent vintage, what if Pineda, Hughes and Freddy Garcia do not respond well to the specter that one of them will be replaced once Andy Pettitte completes his spring program?

Antrim nods in the direction of Donald Barthelme, but Poe and Dostoevsky too, and his tales moves from elegant comedy towards a horror-show cilmax. This book, with so much knowledge and elegance crammed into it, is really about how we're only moving backwards in time. "It is a little-discussed fact that human sacrifices are not strictly ancient occurrences. The practice continues, among certain peoples in certain places, to draw adherents," notes Doug, roaming his father's decaying library. "These stacks, certainly, were dark and haunted by demons." A gorgeous book, and unsettling in its own way.

Satarupa Bhattacharya, a 39-year-old San Mateo recruitment manager, had told us earlier that she had never met a turkey she liked - they've always been too dry and flavorless for her taste.

My first two years in the league, offensively, I was seen only as a shooter since I wasn’t doing much more than that. I just shot three-pointers. Now, I’m seeing less space and less open shots, so that would be super interesting to the team if I could develop a shot from 4-5 meters (12-15 feet) out from the basket off of the screen. If that becomes a weapon, opponents will follow me off the screen and instead I can curl off the pick. So, all of this will help develop my arsenal. I’ve been working hard in practice. I have these shooting drills where I tell myself I have to put in 50 shots in a row. I set big goals. I have already made 50 in a row, 10 shots each from five different spots on the floor (we shoot from one spot and as soon as we have made 10 from that spot we move on to the next one). Those are the more relaxed drills, without too much intensity, but I’ve gone 50-50 on the drill a few times. In general, I try to make ten baskets on 15 shots at most, but that’s the maximum. But, really, the objective is to always make 10 baskets in 13 or less.

As usual, don't look here for the latest, hottest, new-on-the-shelves impedimenta. With one or two exceptions, these are items that have been around for a while and been accepted by the market. More importantly, they're things I've field tested over the last year and can personally vouch for. See the accompanying box for information on where to buy them.
Here is the recipe:
"Back in the day you would get beaten up or punched in the yard and you'd tell a teacher and they'd just tell you to suck it up, you know, or that's just what boys do or that's just how girls are and `You two knock it off,' and that was the extent of it," said psychologist Jerry Weichman, who works with adolescents at the Hoag Neurosciences Institute in Newport Beach, Calif.

The story of that incident is recounted in "Big Miracle," a title that doesn't exactly leave much room for suspense.

"Alvarez has a pretty nasty riseball," St. Francis junior catcher Jacqui Palmer said. "If you don't look for it all the time, she'll get you on it. I always fall for it. Her balls have a lot of good spin. I wouldn't say she's the fastest pitcher I've seen, but her speed is good enough."
Plainfield police announced today the arrests of three suspects who beat, stabbed and burned an 82-year-old man last month after breaking into his home in broad daylight. The thieves got away with cash and left the man tied up in his home.
Lawmakers have no power to redefine objects. They can't pass legislation — not without looking like fools — decreeing that water birds with webbed feet, short legs and broad bills will no longer be known as ducks. Everyone knows what a duck is. And everyone can see that a video lottery terminal fits the constitution's definition of a "slot machine."

The 25-year-old former New York City high school legend followed James in prep stardom, once having a documentary filmed about his senior year at Lincoln High School in Brooklyn.But Telfair, 25, has not panned out in the league thus far.

Last year, Herbert signed a law requiring Utah businesses to use a federal database to verify that their new hires had permission to work in the United States.

Wilde is among my favorite writers, too. But while Oscar Wilde's epigrams - granted, often from the mouths of fictional characters - are deliberately flippant ("To be modern is the only thing worth being nowadays", "There is only one thing worse in the world than being talked about, and that is not being talked about"), G.K. Chesterton is not flippant. He often confessed to being a buffoon, but never to being dishonest. His humor is always bent toward helping his audience laugh themselves sane in a mad world.

He went on to say, "I've got experience on the receiving end and on the giving end in terms of setting up those regulations. But hopefully I can be a one-stop shop to help some of these businesses as well."
What is not in dispute, however, is that Campbell was probably doomed for failure no matter what he did. Five years before he was appointed the Olympic coach, the United States Olympic Committee had put the boxing program on probation because of problems related to the organization's managerial capability and governance structure, a probation that wasn't lifted until after the Beijing Games. By then, USA Boxing was on its seventh chief executive in six years and was well on its way toward a record debt that topped $1.7 million by the end of 2009.
He said the project would be "a development that all of Carroll County can be proud of. ... It will have a positive economic impact, and it will benefit the entire county."
What is most egregious about Mr. Rodkey's letter is that he claims same-sex marriage demeans traditional marriage. I would like to know from him how many heterosexual couples divorced because they felt their marriages have been demeaned by the legalization of same-sex marriages.
The Tax Institute analyzed five same-sex-couple scenarios of varied family incomes, child tax credit considerations and state laws, among other things. It noted factors that tend to increase federal tax liabilities of same-sex spouses compared with married couples filing jointly:

"Rust on the inside of a can would indicate that the hermetic seal has been broken or compromised," Rosche added. "If it truly is rust, this was likely caused by a severe dent or puncture, or the can was opened at some point. Any contact with air would allow bacteria to grow and significantly increase the potential for contamination."
Each of these plays, in their own ways, make the argument that people are just savages at heart, innately individualistic and selfish, constantly and inevitably in competition with one another. Scruples and social niceties are for fools, the inference goes.

STEPHEN WILLIAMSON, 57, Titusville, died Wednesday. North Brevard Funeral Home, Titusville.
5. Quinn figures to be hungry and highly motivated. Again, I don't know why he broke the NCAA rules at North Carolina. I don't know the kid. The Rams are assuring us that he's a good person that comes from a good family. And that he made a terrible mistake that made him feel ashamed. Quinn has said, many times, that he's upset by how he let his teammates down, himself down. Quinn did not play football in 2010. He knows that people are questioning him, wondering about him. He's got to be fired up to prove himself on the field and off the field. When good people screw up, they use the adversity in a way that makes them better. Quinn looks like he can be that kind of man. And if so, the Rams will benefit from his hunger for redemption.

Amtrak dining-car service has always been an up-and-down proposition. But the Empire Builder's amenities included linen and china in the dining car. The menu, somewhat train-specific, offered plenty of tasty options for two dinners, and lunch and breakfast as well. Our dinner favorites were steaks and spare ribs. For lunch, I chose creamy beef and ale soup, and Laurel ordered a salad with apples, blue cheese and walnuts. The next morning, we awakened in North Dakota to a whiteout. At first we thought it was a blizzard, but it turned out to be heavy fog. Roads were slick with rain. By lunchtime, patches of blue had appeared, and in midafternoon, the sun reflected off the remaining snow , scribed by zigzags of game tracks. Backlighted, leafless trees seemed bizarre, capering dancers, arms akimbo.

Slumping Carlos Beltran (three for 32), who had said before the game he wasn't comfortable at the plate, looked relaxed enough when he drilled Burnett's first offering to him for a three-run homer to deep right. It was Beltran's sixth homer, tying him for the club lead with David Freese.

Can Kim G. be trusted?: Jacqueline Laurita tells Caroline Manzo about her run-in with Kim Granatell. "I don't hate her. I don't think she's evil. I just think she's a people-pleaser." Caroline counsels Jacqueline to keep her distance from Kim G. so Danielle doesn't get wind of anything that she can use against Ashley in the upcoming court proceedings. They rail about Danielle, and why she can't any empathy for Ashley when Danielle did stupid things when she was a kid, and blah blah blah, we've heard this all before.

Snark attack: I'm guessing that by now, Albert Pujols is blaming his .225 batting average on the St. Louis media ... Albert's Angels are 6-14. Albert's old team is 13-7. The baseball gods work in mysterious ways... there's no truth to the rumor that Pujols' agent, Dan Lozano, is trying to purchase a couple of home runs for his client ... and no truth to the rumor that Pujols is opening a new restaurant in Anaheim named "Pujols .225." (OK. I'll stop now.)

However, the number is just an estimate, and what an executive ultimately receives will depend on the performance of the company's stock in the years after the awards are granted. Most stock compensation programs require an executive to wait a specified amount of time to receive shares or exercise options.

_ "Big Fish" (2003): "If Fellini had directed `Forrest Gump.'" That's how I described this movie when I reviewed it. Looking back, it seems like even more of a departure for Burton in that it's light and dreamlike, even hopeful. But as a fantastical tale, it absolutely makes sense within his oeuvre. He gets a little too carried away with the quirkiness of his characters, but his film is consistently dazzling, with some individual images that will take your breath away. And it features an excellent cast led by Ewan McGregor, Albert Finney, Jessica Lange and Alison Lohman. It's time for Burton to take more chances like this again.

Officials, though, have declared states of emergency at the six reactors where cooling systems were down — three at Dai-ichi and three at the nearby Fukushima Daini complex.

McMillan has called Canales the hardest-working person in an organization that features a surplus of workaholics. It may sound cliche, but during the season Canales is not only first person in the Blazers' practice facility but also the last. Of course, this is partly because he rarely leaves the place.

San Diego's record is particularly impressive given the city's topography, a sprawling landscape of canyons and valleys that poses a unique challenge in terms of regulating water pressure. There are a whopping 130 different pressure zones in the city of San Diego. It's not unusual for a city with a flat topography to have fewer than 10 pressure zones. Officials at the city's Public Utilities Department made this point to the reporters; the reporters failed to include it in the story.

One unusual aspect of Florida's law that will be apparent in this case is that Zimmerman has a right to a pretrial hearing at which he can try to convince Judge Kenneth Lester, by "a preponderance of the evidence," that he acted in self-defense. If he can meet that standard of proof, which requires showing it is more likely than not that his use of force was appropriate, the charge against him will be dismissed. But even if he went to trial, he would be (or at least should be) acquitted with that much evidence in his favor, since the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he wasn't acting in self-defense - which, as Northern Kentucky University law professor Michael J.Z. Mannheimer pointed out, would be true "in virtually every state."

GM said the Chevrolet brand overall has about a two-month supply available on lots around the country -- a level the company typically tries to keep. Cruze inventories started August at under a 30-day supply.
But as the owners held to the harder line with issues such as revenue split, salary cap, and contract lengths, it will fall to the GMs to make it worth the headache. The league was in this mess for one reason: GMs never really had any restraint, and it was never more apparent than in the summer of 2010, when more than $2 billion was given to free agents.

But after a decade of working and reworking, things began to turn around. Agency rejections turned into representation. Editor ambivalence transformed into interest. Harbach's book, a tale of how lives at a fictional Midwestern university are toppled after a young shortstop's wild throw, became almost magically sought-after — so much so that the publisher Little, Brown and Co. paid more than $650,000 to secure publishing rights during a fierce bidding war.
Notebook: Giants third baseman Pablo Sandoval will miss four to six weeks with a broken bone in his left hand that will require surgery -- the same injury he suffered last year on the other hand.

The Giants expect first baseman and ex-Tiger Aubrey Huff to come off the disabled list Monday after a battle with anxiety disorder.
Garren does not. He's lived in Portland only a few years. He started work to qualify for public financing for this race, then stopped. In his letters to City Club, he notes that in his previous City Council campaign, he collected almost 7,000 votes.

None of this is preordained. Krugman's theory could be right. It responds to an understandable urge to do something about the feeble recovery and the millions left without work and hope. But in this debate, I side with Bernanke. Flirting with more inflation is treacherous. If inflation expectations change, the consequences are hard to predict. The double-digit inflation in the 1970s (peak: 13 percent) resulted from well-intended mistakes and unleashed many damaging side effects.
TRENTON — The state will pay a Pennsylvania family $5 million in damages for the physical and sexual abuse their adopted daughter suffered as a baby while under the care of New Jersey’s Division of Youth and Family Services.

The 1995 agreement called for the city and county to share their fees. But a sunset clause on the fee sharing expired in 1999. In 2008, county police leaders discovered that clause, but by then had sent about $1.5 million in fees to the city- despite conducting the larger share of licensing, said St. Louis County Lt. Chris Stocker. So the county stopped splitting fees at that point.
