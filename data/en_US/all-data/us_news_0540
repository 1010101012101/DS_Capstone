The leaves and stems of nettles are covered with fine hairs that release a potent mix of histamine, serotonin and formic acid when touched. Not to worry -- a quick blanch renders them harmless and ready to eat. To prepare, use tongs to transfer nettles to a large pot of boiling, salted water. Cook for a minute or two to remove the sting, then drain in a colander and rinse with cool water. Trim off any tough stems and chop the leaves coarsely.
People seem to forget that this was a lockout year with an extremely condensed schedule where players, particularly in the Blazers case, were expected to learn on the fly with little practice time. I attribute much of the streaky play we've seen this year to lack of preparation and practice. If we keep this team together for the most part next year, this will be a very solid team. I'm not saying a nice draft pick and someone out of the free agency market wouldn't be a nice addition, I'm just saying this season was one to take with a grain of salt.
"We have a big second-home community, and people are using their second homes a lot more, due to the economy and events that the towns create and promote," said Scott Wahl, public information officer for the borough.

The evangelical God gives big industry the right to frack for natural gas and make your drinking water not just carcinogenic but flammable.
The Ohio Department of Transportation reprogrammed the sign Monday so it provides westbound I-90 travelers an estimate on how long it will take to reach downtown. It's exactly the sort of useful information one would expect to find on the board near Wilson Mills Road. That's why its previous omission perplexed Hopkins for weeks and weeks.
Jennifer Hudson flew to Chicago from Florida to identify the bodies at the Cook County medical examiner's office. If she's called as a witness, she likely will testify about the life and death of the victims.

J. Blynn (bass) and Sarab Singh (drums) attended high school together in the suburbs of Philadelphia, starting to make music together as far back as middle school. Blynn and Peter Harper would later meet in college, forming Pete and J. The three would move to Brooklyn in 2006, eventually meeting bassist “Whynot” Jansveld. (No, Whynot is not Whynot’s real first name, but very close, being a sort of Dutch-English homophone of this Holland native’s birth name.) But with the addition of Whynot, and opting to use Pete and J.’s last names, Harper Blynn was born.

The older Bosnians still have a connection to their home country, and SabaH is an easy way for them to find out what is going on. Their offspring, however, are like other American kids.

Science, they know, does not move ahead based on a single study. It moves ahead slowly as a body of work that, in time, seems to point in one direction. Questions are asked, questions are answered, slowly a consensus is formed and one idea takes hold. Over time, if that hypothesis is proven wrong by further research, the consensus changes.

The Lemonheads are an interesting case of stars aligning, for better or worse: "Ray" was released the same year as Nirvana's"Nevermind," right as radio and major labels were embracing any Serious songwriters with long hair and a "Who cares?" attitude. Dando became a grunge idol of sorts, thanks to good looks and the fact his band released its best album at the right time. In 1993, Dando made People's 50 Most Beautiful People list, which explains a lot.
An overblown, pretentious presentation of Hawaiian culture would attract a lot of criticism.

Schauer's version uses mayonnaise, cheddar, Dijon mustard, chopped green onions and Worcestershire sauce. The bread receives just a thin layer of butter.

By the traditional method, open-heart surgery requires a 12-inch incision, cracking the breastbone and spreading the ribs, resulting in a weeklong hospital stay.

Trader Joe's Carrots Rustica - Nutritionists tell you to have lots of colorful vegetables in your diet, and these yellow and orange carrots have been brightening our meals lately. What's more, they're flavorful and easy to prepare. (One easy trick: Sauté them in a tiny bit of oil with finely diced ginger and a squirt or two of honey.) As with all Trader Joe's products, availability changes frequently, but we've seen these in the freezer case on many recent visits.

This is new. And crazy. No employer should be forced to make that kind of trade-off, not when he's facing tens of millions of dollars in liability if his alcoholic driver falls off the wagon and kills somebody.
If the courts slow those judiciary employees from paying those contributions, Christie will have to walk back some of the estimated savings from his landmark policies. His administration last week confirmed the state would save just $10 million through its health changes, largely because very few public employees are expected to choose any of the new, cheaper state-bought healthcare plans this year.

West and T-Pain would be the first to acknowledge their debts to Jackson and his producer, Quincy Jones. West already has refused the crown, stating publicly that there will never be another King of Pop. He’s probably right: the pop audience is now too fragmented to fall under the sway of any one monarch, no matter how talented. What we didn’t see coming in 1983 was that Jackson himself would fragment along with his audience; that he’d tumble into a heap of loosely connected signifiers. He’d become everything to everybody and, apparently, a riddle even to himself.

The water company says it needs to do this to remain competitive for talent. I know W. Richard Roth, the CEO, who earns a base salary of $625,000 yearly. He's a good guy. But as a customer, I wonder what portion of his golden years I should pay for.
10:15 p.m.: "Land of Hope and Dreams." A song that Springsteen has been performing live since 1999, but that made its studio-album debut on "Wrecking Ball." Honestly, I've never liked this song very much -- too simple, lyrically, and repetitious, musically. But I suspect it's going to be in every show on this tour.
As fans circulate the 90-plus-degree air in the bookstore Saturday, attendees take their seats to watch the three sketches from the first season of "Portlandia" that were filmed at In Other Words. In the first, Steve Buscemi is a hapless guy who ducks into Women & Women First to use the restroom, only to face the withering scorn of Brownstein and Armisen's clerks, Toni and Candace, who lecture him that the restroom is for customers only. In the second, Aubrey Plaza ("Parks and Recreation") is a Portland State University student trying, unsuccessfully, to purchase a book for her class. In the last sketch, Heather Graham plays a would-be member of the store's Journaling Workshop, eager to share her thoughts about how awesome her boyfriend is -- which nobody wants to hear.

In "Mona Lisa" (1986), a freshly-sprung-from-prison Hoskins finds his standing in the underworld seriously depreciated, as reflected in his new assignment: chauffeuring an upscale hooker (Cathy Tyson). To the surprise of both parties, driver and drivee develop feelings for one another. "Mona Lisa" documents the pre-Internet era of porn — remember peep shows? VHS tapes? — and effortlessly glides from funny to touching to depressing. With Michael Caine as a deceptively charming mob boss. Hoskins was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar.
The wonders and joys of special needs parenting are truly endless, and for every difficulty I face raising my son, there are many more ways in which Andrew brings light and love into my life, filling my heart with more "Woohooos!" than I know what to do with.

“I’d located Simpson’s son, born 1939 by another marriage. He had a divers business in some isolated Steinbeck deserted area. I cashed in my miles and spent a week with him. Eventually ‘shunted about as an orphan,’ he said, ‘Nobody’s ever looked for me before.’ He also said, ‘Ernest Simpson’s real name was Solomon. He was Jewish.’”
The backyard, once closed off, is now a true extension of the indoors - an outdoor room that spans two levels. On the upper level, with sweeping mountain and city views, Lobo is planting a garden and adding a dining table. Just outside the bedrooms is an outdoor lounge with a sofa.
He'll never be the underdog. He'll never be a comeback kid. He doesn't have the chops to pull off either. In a party dominated by Southern voters, he has little Southern appeal. He is a religious man whose religion may be a problem for many in the religious wing of his party. As a politician, he's obviously not a natural. And when he tries to be passionate, he usually comes off as jarring. He could have shown some backbone and taken on Rush Limbaugh. But that's not how he rolls — or, maybe in his case, doesn't roll.
Pomegranate: I call this bold, bright red, with purple and some orange tones, exotic. This would be a red wine from a relatively cool region and of low extract. I'd go with plain "village" Pinots from lesser producers in Burgundy, a quaffable Tuscan table red or a rich sherry.

The pavement ends 4.5 miles past the Bartlett Dam Road turnoff (except for a section near Camp Creek), but the dirt road is easily passable in family sedans.
The next day, we went to the beach, but I wasn't sure Darby would enjoy the experience. The last time he hit the water, he didn't do it intentionally. He fell off a dock while chasing a bird; his eyes looked like saucers when he realized what had happened and he had to start dog paddling to stay afloat.
You sometimes wonder why places bother with pizzas when they don't have the equipment for it. The margherita pizza here has wonderfully fresh and aromatic toppings, but the thin crust is soggy.

Sitting in the navigator and radio operator's area of the Marauder, seeing how the co-pilot's seat had to be moved so the navigator, who usually doubled as the bombardier, could crawl into the nose of the ship to drop its lethal load, it becomes clear just how brave the men were.

ø"Dungeon Hunter: Alliance" is a decent action-focused RPG like the popular "Diablo" or "Torchlight" series - and the multiplayer is quite fun - but the experience is marred by less-than-smart artificial intelligence, enemies that can disappear behind objects and a choppy frame rate (the game slows down when there's a lot of onscreen action).
Forced retirement didn't sit well with Carter, who was just 56 years old when he got the boot. He wrote books, helped plan his presidential library near Atlanta, and traveled. All very ex-presidential. But to the standard ex-White House resident's resume, Carter added a few twists. His Carter Center promotes international peace. He builds homes with Habitat for Humanity. He roams the world to promote his version of world peace. The Middle East, Cuba, Korea and Africa are among his past stops.
"We knew we wanted change -- and needed it in order to survive," says Julie Vigeland, who was chairwoman of the theater's board in 1999 when it was looking to replace retiring artistic director Liz Huddle. "But what that change was, we didn't know. We were looking for someone who'd been at a regional theater before -- which Chris wasn't. Chris did not apply for the position, and we would never have known to look at him."
Michael Voltaggio has no idea how many tattoos he has. The question makes him laugh. The wise-cracking 33-year-old chef is pretty well covered. The name of his restaurant, after all, is Ink. Before dinner service on a recent Friday, Voltaggio plays around with an insulated bucket of liquid nitrogen, dipping his hand in it and tossing the residue on the floor where it morphs, CGI-like, into little rolling marbles of chemistry before dissolving into wisps of smoke. He laughs like the 15-year-old kid he was when he got his first covert tattoo, a crude three-leaf clover on his ankle.

Awarding a sawed-off slice of wood to any Portland player who scores a goal in a game is a long-time tradition for the Timbers. Jewsbury, acquired in a trade March 1, didn't know the proper post-game celebration for receiving his slice. So he turned to a long-time veteran of the celebration.

But like the majority of Ohio voters this past fall, the judges ignored Strickland. They stubbornly kept their posts although they had already become highly visible parts of the public corruption scandal that had settled over Cuyahoga County.
The Indians were shut out for the first time this spring as Garrett Richards went four innings with six strikeouts for the win. Their best scoring chance came in the fourth when Travis Hafner reached on an infield single and took second on an error by third baseman Mark Trumbo.

WASHINGTON -- Rep. Charles Rangel's decision to step aside as the chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee not only could be the beginning of the end of his storied career, but also gives Republicans fresh ammunition to use against Democrats in November's elections.

2. "The Mysterious Benedict Society" - Trenton Lee Stewart
Mike Acker: My gut instinct is to try and move Rudy in the offseason. Portland has given him numerous chances to become a big time player, and although he has had his moments, basically it’s been all downhill since his rookie year. I only hesitate because one thing the Blazers need to be sure to do in this offseason is keep from getting worse. Depth was a killer for Portland against Dallas, and as much as it pains me to say this, Rudy is one of the only guys that brought any offense off the bench at least semi-consistently during the regular season. I say you move Rudy if you can get something of value for him, like a guy that can come in and contribute right away. If you can’t get value for him, you have to keep him. I’d take Rudy’s inconsistency over a second round draft pick that is going to need a full season before he’s ready for reliable bench minutes.

In the hands of "Shine" director Scott Hicks, it does what it needs to do to please its target audience with a certain tasteful artfulness and the comforting familiarity of a 1950s melodrama.

It's critical to get the right size hole at the end of the caulk tube. If you make it too big, far too much caulk flows from the tube. If the hole is too small, you work too hard to fill the gaps. I have found that a hole size just over 1/16 inch seems to be perfect.

Benjamin has been a big-play threat for the Hurricanes over the years. Initially an electric return specialist only, he eventually became an effective pass-catching option. He is undersized but shows speed to get past safeties, and the route-running savvy to outwork corners and separate from them to make plays on the ball. He will be somewhat limited in his transition to the NFL due to his size, but there are many receivers of his stature that have shown the ability to overcome this at the next level. Benjamin has third- to fourth-round value due to his speed, ability to separate and experience as a returner.

The final skit was about dating violence. Two teens were fighting. A third tried to intervene. The girlfriend turned to walk away. The boyfriend pushed her. The audience was asked to weigh in on whether the situation was handled well. Most of the audience held up cards with the letter "F" on it for fail. They said they thought that the incident was handled badly, and if the police had arrived, someone would get in trouble.

MR. CASE: I don't really have better ideas. I think you're right that once it's set up, whatever the precedence, whether it's 60 days or 90 days, it's pretty hard to move and people generally assume they're not going to pay until they need to, with the exception being to the extent you've really been able to differentiate and people really believe you're an essential part of their value chain.

The harder way, I believe, is the way of continuing to demand that both sides must come to the table if there is ever to be a lasting peace with justice. It could include maintaining a small investment in Caterpillar,Hewlett-Packardand Motorola, (companies on the divestment list) and demanding (through shareholder resolutions and speaking at annual meetings) that such companies invest in the West Bank and Gaza. Why? Because the real audience is not management but shareholders. A little homework to demonstrate how one-sided investment hurts overall return wouldn't hurt.

Now, I understand Mr. Obama intends to bypass Congress and have the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, loosen the terms (another way of saying "deregulate") of the President's Home Affordable Refinance Program.

The president wants Fannie and Freddie to reduce loan fees and to waive fees on borrowers that refinance into loans with shorter terms.

A. Not directly. Christie withheld a planned $100 million payment to the pension fund. Although $100 million seems like a large sum, it represents 4 percent of the recommended annual payment to keep the fund healthy, according to Moody’s Investors Service. Christie also said he wanted an even stronger package of pension-reform bills than those in the Legislature. Democratic and Republican lawmakers have been working on changes that would require current and future employees to contribute at least 1.5 percent to health care costs and make pension benefits for future hires less generous.

What it means in Oregon
Times have changed.
Dear Margo: I met my girlfriend six years ago online when I was in college. I lived in the U.S. at the time, and she lived in Europe. After speaking regularly for two years, leading up to eight-page letters every other day, we decided to meet in person. When we did, we began an official romantic relationship. We visited each other twice a year for three to four weeks in our respective countries. The problem came from my roommate's reaction when I informed him she would be visiting (her first time) and staying in our apartment. We three roommates at the time were all Christians, but apparently with different views on what is acceptable behavior. One roommate, "Bob," objected to my girlfriend's visit on the grounds of moral impropriety. He was so adamant that he told me that if she stayed, even if I slept on the couch, he would have to leave our apartment during that time. Part of me felt that the apartment was his, too, and therefore he should have a say, but another part felt that as a grown man in a committed relationship, I should not be forced to divide my already minimal time with her by having her stay elsewhere. Ultimately, I allowed Bob to live elsewhere during her stay. To this day, I wonder whether I made the wrong choice in choosing my desires (and my girlfriend's) over Bob's. We are still friends, but the friendship does seem to have been silently fractured by the incident. — Lingering Thoughts

Under Putin, the Chechen rebellion was put down, except for an apparently small contingent of holdouts, through a combination of brutality and largesse. Russian artillery barrages turned Grozny, the Chechen capital, into jagged ruins. Soldiers and police hunted down rebels, their supporters—and, many critics say, hapless and innocent civilians. The Kremlin backed Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov's notoriously brutal security force and poured billions of dollars into reconstructing Grozny.

Michael Pointer: Ideally, wait until the player's junior or senior year in high school. Give him a chance to go through puberty and develop some self-awareness.

Most Southern barbecue fanatics equate ribs with pork ribs, with spare ribs as king. The meaty ribs, which are cut from the pig's belly, have a nice amount of fat to keep them moist during slow cooking.

My wife and I arrived as legal immigrants from Canada four years ago at the age of 63 to be closer to our three children. Having lived in Canada most of our lives, we never contributed to Medicare.

I am afraid we may have to return to Canada, where we enjoyed free healthcare. I am sure that many parents who join their children in the U.S. are in the same situation and would like to know what other options are available.
