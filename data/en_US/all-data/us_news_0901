Public health officials and citizen action committees wanted more, and with the help of some council members, continued to push for expansion during the Monday meeting.

Hey, Steve: I remember a game at Yankee Stadium. It was early in CC Sabathia's career. He had the bases loaded and two out. Jason Giambi was at the plate with a 3-2 count. The base-runners were all moving on the pitch and Giambi kept fouling balls off. Derek Jeter was on first and he was getting such a big jump because Sabathia was pitching from the windup that he was nearly at second base every time Giambi fouled off a pitch.

“One Day”
4KICK IT OLD SCHOOL With fares to places people want to go soaring into the four-digit range, what’s a few gallons of gas, right? It’s time to get reacquainted with the joys of the classic road trip. Fun, right? Tip: Go away — not toward — from the crowds. As in, head north into the wilds of New York’s mighty Adirondack Park, then on to the Thousand Islands, crossing the border (bring passports), looping up to Canada’s attractive capital city, Ottawa. Want to keep going? Give overcrowded Toronto a wide berth, skipping across to the beautiful Bruce Peninsula, then down the shores of lovely Lake Huron, back into the United States and up to Northern Michigan, with outstanding scenery in places like the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore and small towns so charming that even coastal celeb types like Mario Batali are falling in love. From here, you can be back home in a day and a half — if you must. If you can’t have fun on an itinerary like that, you should probably check your pulse, because you might actually be dead.

Like people, plants need food to thrive. Any kind of plant in a container needs regular fertilizing.

Be careful, this novel seems to warn us; be careful of how we apprehend people with names, accents and religions unlike the majority's.
As new residents, we were only one step removed from the average tourist, so most of the time I remember spending in Tarpon was at the Sponge Docks, an area of some historical significance — Tarpon Springs is home to the United States' largest Greek-American community, a result of Greek settlers moving into the area to take advantage of the lucrative sponge-diving business. The Sponge Docks today are more of a tourist destination than a thriving port of industry, and they are home to quite a few interesting bars, restaurants and shops. I grabbed a group of friends and headed out.

For "everything else," read "great expectations." Farah goes to the London Olympics as one of Britain's brightest stars.

After missing our morning flight, enjoying a beverage at City Café while we waited for the next flight, landing in Charlotte and driving the nearly three hours to Aiken, we were not exactly in peak condition when we ran in (late) to the rehearsal dinner. We made apologies, and because we were in the South, were met with two plates of food kept warm for us, two cocktails kept cold, and nothing but warm forgiveness for our Yankee lateness.

One of the liveliest conversations that has emerged on Subtext is within George R.R. Martin's "Game of Thrones," from the bestselling fantasy series recently popularized by HBO. Although Martin isn't there, his editor Anne Groell is, but the book's fans are driving the conversation.

As if to reaffirm the wine's combination of authority and restraint, it went from a double-gold at the Fiddletown Wine Competition in October to best in its class at the San Francisco Chronicle Wine Competition in January.

The Senate and House have rushed to pass a bill explicitly prohibiting lawmakers and their staffs from making stock trades based on the company secrets they're told. The two chambers split, however, over what to do about a new breed of Wall Street professionals who buzz around Capitol Hill, searching for tips that could affect stocks. The work of these "political intelligence" consultants may not merit the same degree of regulation as lobbyists, who actively try to influence legislation. Yet that doesn't mean they should be left to work secretly and unaccountably.

Hijab literally means a curtain or cover. Most Muslims think of it as a three-dimensional curtain that offer privacy.

CyberConnect2's effort is a video game version of a Zack Snyder flick. Just like "Sucker Punch" and "300," "Asura's Wrath" delivers hyper-stylized, balletic violence. Slow-mos are common. Over-the-top action sequences are the norm. It's good fun in the beginning, but toward the end, it ends up being shallow. It's all glitz and no backbone. The only memorable aspect comes from the soundtrack. The developers certainly use music better than Snyder, and it powers the campaign's best moments.

New York: This is no secret. In 2011, the city drew more than 50 million visitors (including day-trippers from as close as 50 miles away), a record. The museums, shows and shops are as impressive and inspiring as ever, and more than 45 hotels have opened since January 2010.

So far, judging from the Cleveland Teachers Union's tepid response to the mayor's Cleveland-only school reform package, the answer appears to be little or nothing.
Marquez was picked up again June 1 and pleaded guilty June 23 to fourth-degree assault for the school beating. He was given eight days' detention and one year of probation.

Unless this dispute is settled quickly, Ohio taxpayers will have to pay an extra $15 million -- or more -- because the state will run two primaries next year, one in March and one in June. At a time when public officials at every level are posturing about the need for frugality, allowing a partisan scrap to force two elections would be an egregious waste of public dollars.
Since then, the district laid off more than 140 employees -- including more than 70 teachers -- and the teacher's union agreed to about $1 million in concessions.
"We have conversations between ourselves all the time," said Wendland, adding that he had "personal conversations" with the other board members. "There's nothing wrong with that."
Travelocity's approach goes some distance toward "certifying the certifiers" to help clear the fog.

We can all agree on one thing: the Wings will have to play much better overall if they hope to win the Stanley Cup. Opening at the Joe or on the road means little unless the power play gets going and the team stays healthy.

There is always a danger in reading too much into body language. But those little individual skating circles after Saturday's game, along with subtle other interactions on and off the ice, gave off the aura that something was amiss in team chemistry with this Shark team.

At the same time, the food and advertising industries point to the institute's statement in the same study that "a causal link between marketing and increasing childhood obesity rates has yet to be firmly established."
1. Matt Holliday's luck is improving, and that probably explains why we're seeing a rise in his recent numbers. There's no question that Holliday was lapsing into a few bad habits as he tried to heat up early in this season. For example, he's been swinging at the first pitch 40 percent of the time, the highest rate of his career. He's chased more pitches out of the strike zone; the rate of 37 percent is up from the 29 pct. in 2011 and 2010. So you can make the case that Matt's more aggressive (impatient?) approach was working against him.

My dad, my father-in-law and my brother-in-law all own Canon DSLRs. They haven't all been completely happy with them, but all three of them have bought a variety of lenses for their cameras. Given the high cost of those lenses, that was a big consideration for me. I knew that we'd likely be able to borrow or swap lenses with our family members from time to time, which is something we couldn't do if I bought a Nikon or a Sony.
Be prepared to be surprised, amused, upset, enlightened, but most of all — engaged. It is always possible to quibble with selections in any anthology. Although there are four selections from free black leader Frederick Douglass, there are no selections from slaves. Because the first volume is confined to 1861, I am confident the contributions of slaves will be included in the next three. In the years ahead, 21st century historians, biographers and political commentators will offer many words about the meaning of the Civil War. I suggest beginning your appreciation of the meaning of the war by hearing it from its 19th century participants themselves.
Property taxes are a heated issue in Baltimore, which has a rate at least double that of any other jurisdiction in the state. But residents disagree about whether developers should be taxed like other property owners on homes they're trying to sell.

But it appears that Will is being tested. Shape-shifting demons lurk in the shadows, taking the forms of his darkest fears. Ghostly women whisper foreboding questions. And his bite mark has been hurting recently, something that hasn’t happened in the nearly 800 years since his death.
Others also were struck by the method of death that Seau chose.
But the bill would present bigger obstacles to naturalized citizens, many of whom would have to pay hefty costs to obtain the proper documents. A passport, for instance, costs about $135. A certificate of citizenship costs $600 and takes eight months to process.
The firm, started by speech Professor Thomas Moser in 1972 because he simply wanted to restore and enjoy antique furniture, has spawned a small dynasty. Three of his four sons work in it, along with 190 employees, and the line includes pieces that reflect a Shaker-like sensibility but also Craftsman and modernist traditions, a signature piece being the continuous armchair (shown at right, $1,150).

So last month Logue went further afield, to Texas, where the unemployment rate is 8.1 percent and the employment base has grown while California's has declined. He notes that Texas added 165,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010 while California lost more than a million. Surely their state policies have something to do with that.
The current Community Academy is a one-day introduction to Portland police training provided by officers that begins at the outdoor firearms range in Sherwood, with the firing of a handgun and shotgun, and ends at Camp Withycombe, where academy members invited by the chief learn about the various bureau units, are put through scenario-based training, allowed to fire the Taser and watch a demonstration by the Explosives Disposal Unit. The academy class then spends several hours on a ride-along with an officer.
Although every child develops at a different pace, parents should trust their observations and share any concerns about developmental delays or lack of social reciprocity with their child's physician. Time is important, so they should be persistent in communicating their concerns and seek additional opinions from child development specialists if they don't believe their concerns are being taken seriously. "Let's wait and see" is not the optimal response when autism is a concern.

Worse, it means that one of America's two major parties is increasingly devoted to finding ways to limit the vote rather than expand it. In fact, what we ought to have is a competition on how to ensure that every citizen can cast his or her vote easily. Automatic registration on birth, early voting, extended voting days, polls that are open on weekends and before and after work days - we should be having a competition on how to increase the vote, not on how to suppress it.

Willie Nelson's new CD set, "American Classic," can refer to the songs or the artist. It's another step in his redefining of the Great American Songbook, one begun more than three decades ago when he daringly recorded "Stardust," a gutsy move for a Nashville singer who had pundits swearing it would ruin his career. Didn't happen, and this latest recording includes songs such as "Baby, It's Cold Outside" and "Fly Me to the Moon." The constantly touring Nelson makes a two-night stop at the Silver Legacy (8 tonight and Saturday night; 407 N. Virginia St., Reno; $65, $80; 800-687-8733; silverlegacy.com).

For Rick Santorum, media coverage swung in his favor only after his major primary victories. After Iowa, Louisiana and his three-peat in Missouri, Colorado and Minnesota, his coverage became favorable, but lingering questions on his campaign’s financial viability and an inability to follow up with further victories stunted his momentum.
I won't bother you with theories about why this is happening. I suspect much of it has to do with globalization and the transfer of manufacturing jobs to lower-cost countries.
Grieg's "Holberg Suite," an evocation rather than imitation of Baroque music, was also heard, in a shapely, soft-spoken account that caressed the music's charms. Dynamic contrasts were nicely noticed. The "Air," with its sadness limned quietly and its sunny side glowing not blazing, was especially lovely. Kraggerud proved that self-effacement has its place in music, too.
Overall, Hersen said, the exposure for Elders has been a positive thing; the story has helped raise the organization's profile.

In Washington, another scandal has broken over excessive spending during a business conference. But travel experts predict the effect this time around will be limited.
3. Diabetes: Effects on insulin and blood sugar levels that would promote diabetes seem to be temporary. Regular use is associated with lower risk, and high intake (3-6 cups a day) seems to have a greater effect. Protection may come from increases in the hormone adiponectin and other factors that affect insulin and blood sugar levels.

"Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils...Pagford is not what it first seems.

A. I always knew coming in that if I wasn't challenged, if it wasn't the hardest work I could be doing, then there was something else I should be doing. You have to exceed your own expectations in this job. You have to be afraid every day.
"This resolution ought to be one that is for free and open competition," Keen said. "Union contractors, if they are the low bid, will get work. Maybe the low bidder is paying prevailing wages."
"It's interesting to look at what you usually don't get to see," Levine said. "Candid photos of people at open stoves, or waiting with belongings at Union Square.

How did director Story and screenwriters Keith Merryman and David A. Newman ("Friends With Benefits") squeeze an enjoyable film out of this? By retaining Harvey's archetypes but getting creative about humanizing the people wearing the labels. The guys consist of the Player (Romany Malco), the Mama's Boy (Terrence J), the Dreamer (Michael Ealy), the Non-Committer (Jerry Ferrara), the Happily Married Guy (Gary Owen) and the Happily Divorced Guy (Kevin Hart). Their ladies, former, current and future, break down into equally slick headlines. Meagan Good is the 90-Day Rule Girl, tired of casual sex and eager to enforce the book's 90-Day rule (no cookies for three months). And so on.
Gingrich, asked on CNN whether Obama deserves any credit for improving employment, said: "If it makes you happy, give him some credit." Even with the new jobs numbers, he said, the most Obama will be able to say is that he is "less destructive" than he was a year ago.
OK, maybe it was a little morbid - or just melodramatic - to be wondering at the spry age of 50 about what will happen when my soul leaves my body. But as I turned back into the sun and headed for home, it was a relief to think it just might end up back here.
Adelson's massive contributions were rivaled by those of conservative Dallas investor Harold Simmons, who with his wife, Annette, and company, Contran Corp., has given a total of $15.4 million to a variety of GOP super PACs. In February, Annette Simmons gave $1 million to Red White and Blue Fund, a super PAC backing Rick Santorum. Her donation exceeded that of Santorum's most public backer, Wyoming mutual fund executive Foster Friess, who kicked in $600,000 in February. (Friess remains the group's largest overall donor, contributing $1.27 million through this election cycle.)
The 1st District special election in January, like the national election in November, is likely to be less about abortion than about the economy, and Cornilles hopes his business background will play more of a role than social issues.

The mind is very, very fast."

Deep in the mountains of politically important North Carolina, Obama soaked up the region's autumn beauty at the same time he assailed foes of his jobs legislation, accusing them of failing to listen to the public.
Arda: On a PPV where matches have the same stipulations but different names (Chicago Street Fight vs. Extreme Rules match), it's nice to see one with a twist -- naturally, with a falls count anywhere stipulation, this one lends itself to going all over the arena. In fact, I wouldn't mind this one going everywhere -- through the crowd, into the merchandise areas, concession stands, the locker room, parking lot, the boiler room (a la Undertaker/Mankind at Summerslam 1996). This is the competitive advantage this match has in terms of standing out from the rest. I see Orton pinning Kane in some remote part of the arena. I'm hoping that of all the matches that are on the card, this rivalry ends at Extreme Rules.
øSo I say you are being myopic, and probably controlling and petty, if you demand that your staff work under your constant gaze. Let go. Loosen the grip.

The authors disintegrate some colossal myths about business success. Take the notion that "great enterprises with 10X success have a lot more good luck." The well- documented finding: Everyone experiences luck, both good and bad, in comparable amounts. "The critical question is not whether you'll have luck, but what you do with the luck that you get," the authors write. They even have a measure for it: ROL, or Return on Luck.

Then again, Murphy, one of Crystal's castmates on "Saturday Night Live" in the Pleistocene era, wasn't the right choice to emcee the telecast that bleeds ratings like a cheerleader in a slasher flick either. If he's not padding his rump as one of the corpulent and flatulent Klumps, he isn't all that charming, a requirement for the gig.
Weisz’s choices in life were nearly as contrarian, although luckily not as devastating.
The Calgary-based pipeline company said it will supplement its application, which was submitted to the U.S. Department of State, with a proposed, alternative route in Nebraska as soon as that route is selected. Nebraska became the focal point of some of the most vocal opposition to the line. Environmental groups and some Nebraska citizens criticized the pipeline's previous planned route through the state's Sand Hills and above the Ogallalla Aquifer, environmentally sensitive areas which they said would be harmed if the pipeline leaked.

Even without the presence of U.S. troops, America's footprint in Iraq is immense. In addition to the fortress near the site of Saddam Hussein's palace, two additional, $100 million buildings are slated to be built outside Baghdad as mini-embassies in the north and south of Iraq. Iraqis know that U.S. troops acting as trainers will still be in Iraq, both as a permanent presence of less than 200 and as an undetermined presence of U.S. troops permanently stationed in neighboring countries. In addition to these troops and embassy personnel, a large and robust force of CIA agents are presumed to be on the ground. As one of the largest contingencies of foreign personnel in any sovereign nation, it is no surprise that Iraqis refused to bargain away their right to enforce their own laws by giving our troops immunity from prosecution.
