The justices also spent part of the day considering a challenge by 26 states, including Michigan, to the expansion of the federal-state Medicaid program for low-income Americans -- an important feature which alone was expected to extend coverage to 15 million people.
That impulsiveness was my undoing. Had I stopped to think, I would have at least put on some gloves and spent a few minutes scanning the shrub carefully before making any cuts. I knew that wasps nested in the dense cover provided by the untrimmed branches. Paper wasps have lived in that rosemary bush for years. I've even been stung before when trimming it.
There were beastly burdens aplenty on the Steed farm, and beasts of burden to handle them. Larry Steed's granddad was a sworn mule man. From sunup to sundown, he'd guide his plow as the team plodded through the heat-hazed East Texas cornfield. In the distance sagged an iron-wheeled, broken-down tractor, an unfulfilled technological promise blithely dismissed as the old farmer muscled into his daily chores.

That was an aberration Thursday, when the teams were what we thought they were, to steal a Dennis Green line. The Tigers beat the A's 10-6 and made a Coliseum crowd of 11,513 wonder how they could have been ranked 10th in the league in both hits and runs.

There is no price tag attached to the project yet, no funding, and no schedule.

A few outtakes from Wednesday's reaction in Arizona to the news about Adam Wainwright:
Little Man is an 11-week-old baby domestic short hair who has been in foster care since he was a tiny kitten. From the beginning, it was obvious that Little Man is big on personality and not one to be ignored. He is a very active, curious kitten, and has never met a toy he doesn't like. He also loves to entertain as he stalks, pounces, and captures his unsuspecting prey. Little Man is healthy, neutered, current on all shots and ready to show the world what cool black cats can really do.

- CHEERS: To the intemperate remark of the week. It’s got to be New Jersey Education Association Chief Vincent Giordano’s “Life’s not always fair, and I’m sorry about that,” in response to an interview question about poor children trapped in bad schools. While it may not be a firing offense, as Gov. Chris Christie contends, it was pretty callous.

U.S. officials have been passing the word that the objects of the exercise are to react to the recent launch of China's first aircraft carrier and its development of the Dong-Feng 21D "carrier killer" missile capable of sinking any aircraft carriers in the region; increase American influence in the South China Sea, much of which China claims as sovereign territory; and reassure allies in Asia that the U.S. will retain a strong presence in the region to counter a rising Chinese military presence. China may just be paying the price of ignoring Teddy Roosevelt's dictum—speak softly and carry a big stick—by speaking belligerently to its neighbors and the U.S.

Comment: Top-15 talent. As physically gifted as any 2012 prospect, any position. Tremendous footwork and hands. Excelled at Senior Bowl and in certain combine drills. Has the look of a dominant player. But will he buy in mentally on every snap? By his own admission, he did not play as well as in junior year. Does he wants it badly enough? At least one team in first half of first round will be sure it can maximize his vast potential.

Before I left to cover a Monsters game, I did a light, 35-minute treadmill and some crunches. Much to the dismay of my paunch, I'm starting to get addicted to crunches. Siebert had me scheduled for a rest day following back-to-back weight/cardio days, but I wanted to extend my treadmill streak to double-digits for the first time in forever. I wore a sleeve on the right knee for the second straight day and the knee calmed down.
As for Kaufmann, his appeal is not just a question of rugged good lucks and his virile, grainy voice. His tenor barrels forward with impressive volume and intensity as he endures torture at Scarpia’s hands, but the poetic phrasing and breathtaking piano singing in his final aria “E lucevan le stelle” (“And the stars were shining”) are even more memorable. He can be heard more on a new CD of Verismo arias (also on Decca) that’s worth checking out.

RIM knows consumers won't buy its new phones or tablets unless developers get excited about the platform and create a wealth of apps to operate on it. A dearth of apps for the legacy BlackBerry is one of the big reasons RIM has suffered huge market-share losses to Apple Inc and Google Inc's Android in recent years.
While our McKinley Bridge was opened just nine years after the assassination of President William McKinley, it memorialized not him but the William McKinley who founded the railroad that built it.

But they all knew — the sports information directors, the public address announcers, the media members — that Craig Biggio, Seton Hall University’s catcher just backing up the play, would beat the batter there.
No, it was during awards season. We shot this right after the Oscars, basically, and I got on set and I went into this little room with Jonathan and Joe, and we read through all our scenes just one time. That’s all we had time to do: read through it all once just to say it out loud. Then, we immediately went and filmed the scene. I was really impressed with Joe’s ability to make a connection on screen.

When researchers at Durbin's hospital looked at children between the ages of 1 and 4 hurt in wrecks, leg injuries were rare for those in rear-facing seats, while they are the second most common injury for those in forward-facing seats, he said. That's because the legs of a child in a forward-facing seat are thrown forward in most crashes and can hit the console or the back of the driver's or passenger's front seat.
Late last month, the Toledo Democrat marked Great Lakes Week on Capitol Hill with a speech on the House of Representatives floor that discussed the need to prevent voracious Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes and threatening its $7 billion fishing industry.

Some legislators, particularly state Sen. Catherine Pugh of Baltimore, have been pushing similar bills for years, to no avail. The principal objections were that raising the dropout age would cost too much money and that forcing older students to be in school against their will would be too disruptive to those who are intent on getting an education. But 18 states already require children to stay in school until they are 18, and President Barack Obama has called on the rest of the states to follow suit. Although the change will create some logistical difficulties, the costs to society posed by the thousands of students who drop out every day are too great to ignore.

And that brings us to professional athletes' salaries. Obviously there's nothing illegal about their outrageous payment demands - and they're not directly taking my own money - but they still give me that old feeling of having been stolen from. What's really shocking to me is the way average people defend those players' ridiculous paychecks as being fair or "worth it," and they accuse team owners and management of being stupid businesspeople if they're reluctant to fork over the organization's bankroll.

The net result will be to create more of a financial burden for families and small businesses in the midst of economic hard times. Maryland's poorest families will be hit the hardest with this very regressive proposal, as more of their income will be required just to meet daily needs.

A: Some will. More than a dozen astronauts will still go to space and live on the space station. Others will wait around for slots on still-to-be-built spaceships, including the ride to an asteroid. Others will leave the program. The same thing happened after the Apollo program ended nearly 40 years ago.

There are a lot of favorites for a lot of reasons. The most unique and priceless honor that I had was in the 14th District, where I lived in government quarters that happened to be at Diamond Head Lighthouse.

Joss Whedon's take on the Marvel collection of good guys is about as great as a superhero movie can get.

Councilman Ash Kalra, who has pushed for the council to address this issue, wants some kind of cap, though he's still exploring the best way to implement it. "I would hope that everyone on the council is on the side of the residents and not the payday lenders that are preying on them," he told us.

A: For 40 years, my formula has been to love yourself, move your body and to watch portion size. But the No. 1 thing is to love and value yourself. ...People spend thousands in therapy digging and digging in the past. When you dig and dig, you find relics. Try to forgive yourself and get back on that ride. Ride Sally Ride! (He begins to sing.) On this magic carpet ride!

Unlike the Butler Act under which Scopes was prosecuted, the bill does not require that the creation story in Genesis be taught as science. In fact, it states that the legislation "shall not be construed to promote any religious or non-religious doctrine." The Seattle-based Discovery Institute, which provides state lawmakers with a model for such "academic freedom" laws, says this is proof that the bill isn't designed to further religion. Critics, the institute says, are "putting up a smoke screen to divert attention from their goal to censor dissenting scientific views."

Organizers are preparing for another festival in this fall. The symbol of the swan was engraved on the face of a coin that was found during the excavations of the Klazomenai archeological site. The swan represened Urla. Below the swan is the olive, a symbol of abundances and above the swan is the olive branch, a symbol of peace.
"Cactus Flower" exemplifies the French "boulevard" style, in which someone lies to cover up naughty sexcapades. Inevitably, the fib spins out of control, wreaking manic havoc in the process.
When the two men hung up, Imdad was unsure of what to do. The man had threatened Obama and the Quran. He had no idea if Conaway had been serious about either, and although the threat against the president may have been far-fetched, Imdad knew Conaway was more than capable of burning a copy of the Quran, filming it and sending the footage around the world via the Internet.

SKILL MISMATCH
This franchise must know that it has work to do. It needs a mental adjustment. It needs to do some soul searching. Forget more talent. It needs to recognize that adding the toughness of Wallace and Wesley Matthews, and making moves at the NBA trade deadline, got it no closer to the second round than it was 12 months ago.
He was 12 when he first attempted fusing the cuisines.
"Bye umma," he says as he rushes out, calling her mom in Korean.

He denied that former Prime Minister Tony Blair of the Labour Party had consulted with him on how to discredit French leader Jacques Chirac in the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

"It's tough to come into a series like that," said Carle, who spent some time paired with Gustafsson in the regular season. "He knows what to expect at this level, but when you come into a playoff atmosphere, it's a little bit faster, a little bit more intense. He just makes a lot of little plays that a lot of people don't notice. His panic level is low, and he made a really good play on that goal - taking the ice that was given."
The rest of the food world is catching on.

The new approach takes a little while to get used to, but makes for a better album, and a much more interesting perspective. "Mondo Amore" concludes with two dynamite tracks: the slow-building "Heavy Boots," a desperate prayer (set to a gorgeous-sounding church organ) and "The Tower," a six-minute waltz-tempo roller-coaster ride pitched somewhere between Dusty Springfield and Big Brother and the Holding Company. When Atkins hits the final chorus and begins to wail about a tower crumbling down, she sounds as if she’s pushed past exhaustion and discovered something essential about herself. Most of the narrators on "Mondo Amore" have reached similar conclusions: They’ve squeezed wisdom from disaster and, having survived the worst, are surveying a tattered world with brand new eyes.

Pork not your thing? This same procedure can be used on whole chickens. The main difference is that you'll want to brine a chicken for just 4 hours, not 24. Of course, the cooking time will depend on how large your chicken is; just cook until the internal temperature of the meat is 160 degrees.
Alley said the Romney campaign never accepted any of the modifications. And he said Santorum didn't want to appear in a debate that didn't include his chief rival in the race. In fact, Santorum's campaign has started pushing the idea that he deserves a one-on-one debate with Romney.

How do airlines persuade us to accept less? They ask for original receipts that they know we don't have. They claim that they don't cover fragile items, such as electronics and collectibles. They take forever to process our claims, dragging things out for so long that we forget what we lost.

An accent wall in a strong color adds drama. In bedroom design, tone down the bold paint's drama by using a darker tone. A deep blue, such as Irises 1440, mirrors the light at dusk, making it a soothing choice. If used in a nook, it envelops the bed, like a favorite cashmere sweater, and feels sheltering and calming. The juxtaposition of light and dark surfaces, fabrics and paint, keeps a balance between tranquility and invigoration.

The hall has made a commendable attempt to diversify its honorees and broaden its focus. Yet as the 25-year restriction continues to elapse on popular musical acts of the ’80s, its roster has become increasingly incoherent, and cracks in the foundation are beginning to widen. The hall’s relationship to hip-hop has been a strained one so far (L.L. Cool J, who was on the ballot last year, has dropped off), although the induction of Eric B. & Rakim would extend an olive branch. And the hall seems to have no interest whatsoever in electronic music — a blind spot that will surely have to disappear if the museum wants to stay relevant.

The time has come. Ben must now choose between Lindzi (“Horse Girl”) and Courtney (“Model”). With the public rooting for Lindzi and the tabloids following Courtney as she tries on wedding dresses, it’s anyone’s game to lose. Though “winning” Ben may or may not be actually be considered a win. His mother (Barbara) and sister (Julia) join him in Switzerland for the finale.

I have nothing against virgins, or 42-year-old virgins, for that matter, but as a recent divorcee, this wasn't the kind of conversation I was hoping to have on a first date. I admit I've been out of the game for decades — the last time I did this, I still drove a stick shift — but even I know there are some things you just don't say the first time you sit down with a prospective mate.

For many Brazilians, things in the U.S. appear so cheap it is hard not to buy everything in sight. Consider Vladimir Lúcio Martins's experience, a court clerk on vacation in the New York area last month with his family. A motorcyclist, Mr. Martins bought a Shoei helmet for $587, a quarter the cost in his hometown of Presidente Prudente, he said. He made repeat trips to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores in New Jersey. At a Costco in Clifton, N.J., he couldn't believe the $7 price of a can of Kraft Parmesan Cheese, a fraction of the Brazil cost. He bought it.

In four games through April, Bryant averaged 30.8 points on 56.6% shooting, while Bynum, World Peace, Gasol and Ramon Sessions played similar offensive roles.

He ran the floor with impressive speed, and showed good court awareness in a give-and-go with center Chris Kaman that Griffin finished with a layup. On one play, he grabbed a rebound and dribbled the length of the floor and was fouled on the layup attempt. He also showed the strength to get deep post position.
Common sense tells you to reward the employees who sell the most widgets, and who come up with strategies for their co-workers to sell them too, right?
øAnother plus for Wilkinson is that his wife, actress Diana Hardcastle, was hired as a love interest for Pickup's goatish rake. Was it like a second honeymoon? "We've never had a first honeymoon," he says with a harrumph. "I've done it a few times, worked with my wife. And initially I thought, 'This is not going to be so good.' But it has always turned out to be a blissful experience."
I also remember another problem in a classroom. I was standing before a class and looking down on the podium. The pages of notes that I had placed on the podium had suddenly disappeared. I was suddenly embarrassed and very anxious, but like James Bond, I can be very calm when under pressure.
