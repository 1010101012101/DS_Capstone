But whether Democrats follow through with that pledge—and go all in for Donnelly by spending large sums of money in the race—is an open question. Indiana has been a hard place for Democrats to win.

"I hated it when analysts and commentators were saying, `He's thinking this. He's thinking that,'" Faldo said. "But this analyst here, I've walked the walk.

As a mediating presence between past and future, the Gonzalez Goodale design manages well enough, and a collection of public art woven into the campus effectively engages the hotel's complex history without having to mimic its architectural forms. The new construction, for the most part, is confidently contemporary and free of ornament, if also decidedly risk-averse.

To call marriage a "right" for anybody is misleading. If two people (or three or more) want to create their own contracts (keep in mind, that this is what marriage is to the state) with their own terms and call it marriage, the state has no business stopping them from doing so, regardless of their gender. Likewise, if a religious institution wants to recognize only the partnership between a man and a woman as marriage, the state again has no business in getting involved. There is absolutely no role for the government to play in marriage other than enforcing contracts in the case of divorces or other disputes.

Maybe. Video-game environments are entertaining and tidily self-contained — unlike real war, where the blood lingers long after players switch off the Xbox 360.

Elements of that era can be seen at the picnic. Little kids leap inside an AstroJump placed on home plate. Down the right field line, the band begins to play "Strawberry Fields Forever." Parents and kids sprawl on blankets on the outfield grass.

It is important to address some misconceptions about Missouri's regulatory framework that were suggested in the commentary "Ameren doesn't need rate increases" (June 8). First, the Missouri Public Service Commission and its staff, the Office of Public Counsel and others carefully review all costs UE seeks to recover from customers. Seventeen parties participated in UE's last rate case. There's no lack of oversight, as was suggested in the commentary. Nor does UE have a "virtually guaranteed double-digit profit margin." It's true that our rates reflect a return on our investment. But the regulatory framework provides us with the opportunity to earn that return, not a guarantee. While UE's PSC-authorized return has exceeded 10 percent, its actual earned returns have been much lower – 6.7 percent as of Dec. 31.

Not a lot of coaches would have been able to do that, based on what he's gone through the past couple of weeks. In fact, not a lot of coaches would have survived the past couple of weeks. Many organizations would have fired the coach just to stop the bleeding, even though it's clear what is going on in Orlando has nothing to do with Van Gundy and everything to do with six-time All-Star center Dwight Howard, who may or may not want to be traded and may or may not be getting his wish before he becomes a free agent this summer.

She was, in a way, up to speed with them from the start, with the same near-mystical "feel for the water" all exceptional swimmers have.

You have to have three legit corners to survive in this league and that's why corners are such a big deal. He is a really, really good one."

It would be absurd, though, to think that some magical High Line formula might apply in Santa Monica.

This is the most difficult job I've had. And I know that sounds dramatic and actor-ish, but I swear to you, it is the most difficult job I have ever had: 1) I'm in every scene. That, in it of itself, was grueling. The workload was the heaviest I've ever had. Ever. 2) Comedy is the most difficult thing to do, day in and day out.

I told them I wouldn't leave them in a bind and that I would hold off on doing anything until they were able to figure out where they wanted to take the panel next.

"For low interest rates on subsidized Stafford loans to be sustainable for future generations of Americans, we need to elect leaders who don't recklessly spend the money college graduates send to Washington when repaying their federal loans," Considine said. "It is estimated that 85 percent of student loan debt is owed to the federal government, which is $15.6 trillion in debt itself.

Capistrano Unified, with nearly 400 potential job cuts this year, has the fourth-highest tally in California, according to the state teachers union. More than 340 of Capistrano's warnings went to its temporary employees, many of whom are former tenured educators laid off and then rehired on a year-to-year basis.
Dear Colin: I've had chronic low back/leg pain for 10 years that has frustrated my doctor and others he's referred me to for help. Several imaging studies reveal mild spine arthritis but nothing else. Treatments have consisted of medication, injections, manual therapy, chiropractic, massage, ultrasound and hundreds of PT (physical therapy) exercises that seem to only make me worse, prompting everyone to tell me to "take it easy." As a result, I've gained 80 pounds and become clinically depressed. My knees have even started hurting. This is frustrating! What else can I do?
Klett's pairings of recent and old views of the city deliver jolts of optimism, despite the many architectural deformities that have crowded the cityscape in the past century. Much of the show is contained in the paperback "After the Ruins, 1906 and 2006: Rephotographing the San Francisco Earthquake and Fire" by Mark Klett, Philip L. Fradkin and Rebecca Solnit (University of California Press; 134 Pages; $24.95).

Hagan has taken the lead in calling for a moratorium on injecting waste deep into the ground and asking pointed questions about the incident.

After construction crews cut a huge opening in the building in order to remove the old lid and move the new one into place, they discovered a crack in a part of the concrete that is not considered structural. Further ultrasonic investigation has found numerous such cracks in other fa ade-like outer portions of the building -- and two areas of hairline cracking in the building's main walls, where steam pipes pass through.
Legislators need not expect that freeing the Cleveland schools from rules that favor union interests above all others will "save" the district. But they must recognize that until they are freed from those rules, this city's schools will remain beyond salvaging.
That is why Clayton school officials told St. Louis parents in
Apple has plenty of new products in the pipeline, and there should be few bumps in the short term. But it's not clear if Jobs' brilliance -- both as a product visionary and a super-salesman -- was ultimately transferable. The lukewarm reaction to Cook's first big product introduction on Tuesday could be seen as a warning sign.
Meow , however, is not the fattest cat out there. That record belongs to Himmy, a tabby from Australia that weighed almost 47 pounds. The shelter said Guinness World Records has since stopped accepting applications for the record over concerns it would encourage people to overfeed their animals.

It is not a simple budget equation. The authority’s red ink is driven in large part by things beyond its control. For example, it is required under statute to operate a certain amount of days of horse racing. Were that to change, so would the budget numbers.
Service is top-notch, especially given the frequent explanations required by the cryptic menu -- to say it's written in haiku would be unfair to the explanatory powers of haikus.
Orchid Grill & Kabob, co-owned by Abbas and Sarah Mohammadi (who are also co-chefs), has been in the same Tarzana strip mall for 17 years, but it's slowly grown from a tiny stall to full-sized restaurant. It's been doing business for nine months since the last expansion. The newest incarnation is bright and open and cheerful, with big windows and an enormous steam table for lunch buffets. Family members seem to be constantly wandering in and out of the kitchen. It can feel like you've been sucked into an Iranian family party.
Schneider Smeltz Ranney & Lafond PLL: Scott Robinson joined the Cleveland law firm as an associate involved in the practice.
In the 1990s, Musial donated 75 percent of his personal collection to the Hall, and that forced it to shed the title of St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame and yield to its baseball roots. The Cardinals current ownership has added to the collection through the past decade. The Hall has more than 15,000 artifacts and more than 80,000 photos. The collection has items that date back to the 1880s and every era since.

The Gilroy event, which started on March 31 but was postponed early in the program by stormy weather, had fewer participants last Saturday, as many teams stayed home, resting up for league trials and finals that take place over the next two weeks. Lynbrook athletes, however, made the trip south and their efforts made the trip worthwhile.
Chalkboard, which led Sherwood and Tillamook to step up teacher performance efforts over the past few years, will lean toward systems that help teachers improve and provide better feedback about their performance rather than handing out money for results.
"So it's not just adding a gritty guy here or there. You can have all the gritty guys you want, but when you're giving up 2-on-1s, 3-on-2s and 4-on-2s, and making poor decisions to give up these odd-man rushes, I don't care how much grit you've got in your lineup. About the only thing they're going to do is pull the puck out of the net harder. That's what our problem is, for us to win, we need to play a certain way. We're very successful playing that way. And the last 10 games, we have gotten away from that. It's not based on who's in the lineup because the same players that were in it before these guys came back, we were having the same difficulties. It's not based on personnel ... it's based on attitude."

U.S. Reps. Steve LaTourette and Marcia Fudge have an even bigger idea: a $4 billion federal bond fund for demolition; especially hard-hit areas would be eligible for extra money. Communities trying to recover from the abandonment plague need lots of help, and the bipartisan duo have come up with a clever way to provide it. Congress should move quickly to enact their idea.
At a meeting, Councilman Chris Herndon — who introduced the map that was chosen by eight of the 12 council members — explained that people will find more of a unified voice if they are able to express it through their neighborhood.

In 1989, when he was about 21 years old, Cipriani pleaded guilty in New Jersey to kidnapping and "threat-to-kill," according to court records. Armstrong noted that his client was a young man at the time, and that the case couldn't have been serious because the judge imposed only four years probation, which ended after the second year.
"I was breathing shallow to avoid going into shock," said Goss, laid up in a hospital bed with bandages wrapped around both of his legs. "I'd heard you should do that on 'I Survived' on the BIO Channel."
A: I love the opening credits of "Manhattan," but my favorite city- centered movie of late would be Woody Allen's "Midnight in Paris." It builds on the rich history of the city but carries that legacy forward into modern-day Paris. It shows how we sometimes romanticize the past at the expense of the present.
Another Balloon Ball. Mystery, drama, pathos, more than 150,000 eyes focused on the flight pattern. Could the Broncos replicate the Jets?
Jordan Boase, the former University of Washington sprinter who trains with Bailey on the Nike campus, is coming off an impressive victory in the 200 at the Kansas Relays over a field that included Olympic silver medalist Doc Patton.

It was Jerry Rubin, the 1960s counterculturalist, who observed that “the power to define the situation is the ultimate power.” Certainly that’s true in our government, in mass media, and in most arguments about the practicality of your kid’s latest tattoo or body piercing.
The conglomerate of citizens, civic groups, organizations and businesses banned together to patrol neighborhoods, help smoke out criminals in hiding and quietly encourage reluctant Detroiters who may have information about homicides and other crimes to come forward.

But hang in there to peruse such areas as the soldier and sailor database (where I think I found a relative who served in the 19th Regiment of the Kansas Cavalry), prisoners, politicians and spies. You could get lost for hours (I did—sorry, boss) looking up all the cool information. Plus there’s a list of Civil War facts that puts it all in perspective.

North Coast County Fire Authority personnel used a high powered hose to vacuum up water from the first floor hallway. They followed up with squeegies to leave the carpeted floor as dry as possible. No evacuation of any units was necessary, said Matt Lucett, NCCFA spokesperson.
In some ways, Cook was ripe for a bit of reinvention. He arguably has as many detractors as fans — those who derisively dismiss him as too good-looking and not funny enough — and his attempts to forge a career as a movie star haven't gone smoothly. Within the last decade, Cook has starred in critically panned gross-out comedies including "Good Luck Chuck" and "Employee of the Month" that barely registered at the box office.
About 1,000 workers employed by a company that runs park services as well as about 800 park workers would be affected. Business outside the gates would also suffer.

Doubts by federal regulators about whether four winning firms really qualified as “disadvantaged businesses” have the potential to generate major headaches, some city council members fear.
Parole, probation and court psychiatric clinic officials have access to the system at the prosecutor's office rather than logging in remotely.

For Offutt and Novak, they said the experience never even crossed their minds back when they played together.
It's unfortunate, yet understandable. Urban renewal is much easier than job creation because it doesn't involve fixing public schools, rethinking our tax structure, improving shipping corridors or crafting a compelling sales pitch to beat back communities far more willing to offer huge tax breaks and lift environmental restrictions.
And while there are flaws with the roster, the team features enough top-to-bottom talent and assets to field a winner for years to come. Nevermind the fact that the franchise has won 152 games and reached the playoffs the last three seasons.
The Arc de Triomphe has a special significance for World War II since Adolf Hitler marched his Nazi troops through the iconic monument when Germany took over France in 1940. It also was the site where Allied troops — including many U.S. soldiers — celebrated victory over Germany 67 years ago.
But the main thing you will have to get used to is the exhaustion. You may have spent several days straight awake in your youth, but nothing will prepare for the months on end with too little sleep. You say you stayed awake for two days while cramming for finals in college so you know all about being tired? Oh, your naivety is so cute. Let me guess what you did after the last final was over: you slept for 18 straight hours. Well, this is parenthood and you can sleep for 18 straight hours ... in about 18 years. For now, you have to live on three or four hours' of sleep in a row for months at a time. You will become friends with caffeine or you will become friends with the sleep-deprivation-induced hallucinations that will visit you from time to time.

The menu is long enough to be a book, divided into hot and cold appetizers, salads, soups and noodles, a raw bar, main courses, steaks, sushi and sashimi, maki and dessert. Some classics are delightful, such as the brick-red Angry Chicken ($26), surrounded by peppers. Close your eyes and you might think you're south of the California border or in India, but the chicken has been milk fed and brined for 36 hours to achieve the meltingly tender consistency that contrasts with its explosive spicing.

Details: This isn't the highest peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains -- that honor goes to Loma Prieta, at 3,790 feet, on private property and only reachable from Santa Cruz County. Mount Thayer, at 3,481 feet, or Mount Umunhum, at 3,478 feet, are also off-limits. These four mountains in the chain have a bluish haze that gives them their name: "Sierra Azul," or blue range.
There are two major concerns here. The drinking and the violence. The first thing that the Tigers must do is to determine whether alcohol is a serious problem in Youngs life or if that was just an ugly bender. I dont believe as others do that the Tigers have a discipline problem on the team simply because Youngs arrest -- coupled with Miguel Cabreras highly publicized episodes -- gives the Tigers three incidents in a three-year period. The Cabrera arrests marked a pattern. This is just another player acting like a fool late at night in New York City. I hate to break it to you, but 26-year old men in the Big Apple tend to drink sometimes when they have the chance. Im willing to bet that Young wasnt the only person in the drunk tank that night. Thats not a disturbing trend. Thats reality.

What triggers high blood pressure in youngsters? The No. 1 cause is childhood obesity, but about 5 percent of kids have elevated blood pressure for no clear reason. Regardless, it needs to be spotted and controlled with diet, exercise and medication if needed, just the way it is in adults. Lowering blood pressure in little kids and young adults could have a huge pay-off later on: saving their life.

Commissioners have long argued that the sheriff's office doesn't control its costs and is beholden to the powerful corrections deputies union. Recent scandals over sick and overtime abuse have intensified those feelings. Former Sheriff Bernie Giusto perhaps best embodied that tension when in 2005 he famously called county commissioners his bankers, not his bosses. Those words still get repeated in disagreements about sheriff's office spending even though that was two sheriffs ago and an entirely different board.

Roy said his left knee has bothered him throughout his NBA career. And every year he said it has needed to be drained throughout the season. Now, however, whatever is going on in there appears to be sapping his super powers, and Roy can tell it.
The offense managed just 16 runs in the homestand. The Indians have not hit a homer in 11 straight games, their longest streak since a 14-game drought in 1983.
“I feel like my game will improve with their coaching style,” said Sledge, who starred at Long Island Lutheran and Half Hallows Hills West in his high school days. “I just thought it was a good idea for me to go there. It was a good fit for me. They let their guards play and penetrate the gaps, create for shooters. I felt like after watching what they did for Scott Machado and Lamont (MoMo) Jones, it would be a better place for me to go.”
The race to succeed Jackson has drawn two powerful groups to claim candidates, positioning the race - on paper, at least - as a battle between the teachers union and the business community.
“The question became his medical issues,” Leo told the judge. “Mr. Jackson deserves incarceration, but his medical condition speaks volumes about something else … that affected him far worse than jail. A person similarly situated without these medical conditions would have never gotten this amended from second-degree to third-degree.”

Exploding cartoons to environmental scale is a street art staple. Cartoons and graffiti are both forms of mass art — not popular art, which is consumer-oriented, but mass art, which is hurled at anyone and everyone.

Born in Mitchelstown, County Cork, in 1928, Trevor spent his childhood in provincial Ireland and draws much of his material from that region still. Now, with "Love and Summer," his gift of empathetic attention to the lives of "little" people remains on full display.

They meet by accident in the small Irish town of Rathmoye in the mid-1950s; the two are drawn to each other, and their shy secretive courtship comprises the bulk of the book. Both characters are cautious yet, in their dreams, daring; neither understands the stakes of the romantic game they play, and neither is practiced at love. Nor do they understand how closely they are being watched by others in the town.

So a year ago, I turned my tourism inside-out. Since then, I’ve roamed the cities, beaches, valleys and hills of Los Angeles and Orange counties, assembling more than 120 Southern California itineraries, favoring independent enterprises over national brands. (As will become clear pretty quickly, these tips are one man's opinions, entirely unscientific but informed by firsthand experience.
