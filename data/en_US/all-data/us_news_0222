Layered salads are a boon to anyone looking for an easy, portable dish to bring to a cookout or family reunion. They look pretty in their transparent serving vessels, and they offer a veritable symphony of textures and flavors. What make this particular version Midwestern are the ingredients. Maytag blue cheese, prized for its robust taste, has been produced on a family-owned Iowa farm since 1941; dried tart cherries are from Michigan. Wheat berries, or whole wheat kernels, are a product of the so-called wheat belt that spans the Midwest, and whose center is Kansas; when boiled the same way as rice or other grains, they are nutty and chewy, and a wholesome addition to salads, including this one.

Tim Brown, Yahoo! Sports: "The best news is McCourt is gone. The second-best is Magic will one day sit in the field boxes near the third-base dugout, wave those big ol' arms, smile that big ol' smile, and sign a stinkin' left fielder. Other people will get caught up in what McCourt and his ex did here. What they did to the franchise. How they made people feel here. Other people will wonder what the hell is wrong with a world in which gluttony triumphs and dignity runs down the leg of Major League Baseball. But, that's not what's being toasted in Echo Park, in East L.A., in Van Nuys, in Pasadena, in Hancock Park. The Dodgers had become an emotional and civic burden. Under Fox and then McCourt, in a time when the Los Angeles Angels thrived and the only thing on television was New York Yankees-Boston Red Sox, the Dodgers too often showed up wearing high-water pants and yesterday's T-shirt. Today, assuming McCourt navigates a mid-April bankruptcy court ruling and the Guggenheim Baseball Partners' deal survives a late-April MLB vetting, the Dodgers are dignified again."

iv. In fact, Federated payroll was cut by $72 million last year, while our entire pension contribution was only $87 million. The City's contribution in 2008 was $55 million. So, our contributions increased by $32 million over this period and payroll was cut by $72 million. Most people don't know that and I don't think your newspaper has reported it!

"We always buy trip insurance. This time we bought from Holland America, though I know it is recommended to buy from a neutral company. My husband got Legionella pneumonia and was transported to a Seattle hospital. This was the beginning of a 10-day stay. The ship's doctor filed all the information and I was soon contacted for trip arrangements home as soon as he was able to travel. We were in almost daily contact to figure out when we'd be able to fly. My husband's oxygen level was not up to par, so we were escorted home by a flight nurse who (arranged) private transportation to the airport. The cruise line made flight reservations for my husband and the flight nurse, but I was to make my own and then be reimbursed by the trip insurance. In all our travels, this was the first time we've made a claim on trip insurance. The flight nurse said she has rescued people from every part of the world, of every age, and believes all travelers, domestic or foreign, should buy annual trip insurance just in case."

Kavanaugh is not alone; Judge Diana Gribbon Motz of the Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit also raised this issue. It's a good sign that the Supreme Court's order taking the case called for one hour of oral argument just on the Anti-Injunction Act. That means the justices are taking this question seriously and could determine that they don't yet have jurisdiction to consider the constitutional issues.

This type of home, quite common along the Delmarva Peninsula in the 1950s and 1960s, is designed with screened-in breezeways running through the house, splitting it in half. Not only does the breezeway cool the house down — imagine a center hall from front door to back, only without the screens — but it also renders the structure a bit more impervious to storms, since the wind will whip through the house instead of at it.

A: The new onset of floaters may indicate a detachment of the vitreous gel from the retina. In some patients, this tears the retina, which can lead to a retinal detachment. A dilated eye exam is recommended to be sure there is no retinal tear or detachment. It should be done as soon as possible if new floaters appear in abundance or if the person's vision is obscured. If a tear or detachment is ruled out, occasional floaters are not a serious phenomenon. In some patients, however, they can be very disturbing. If the troublesome floaters do not subside, surgery can be performed to remove them, but in the majority of patients, this is not necessary.

McKinley's prologue quickly relates indigo's history, and hers. The deep blue comes from harvesting, drying, and fermenting small leaves plucked from a shrub. Across millenniums and continents the color symbolized royalty and divinity. It served in mourning rites, shaded eyelids and hair, stimulated healing and sex, tattooed bodies and deepened ornamental scars. Like gems, it became a currency. Like silk, it was coveted, commercialized, and expensively resold to people who once created it. Indigo's legacy became McKinley's own: Her adoptive parents' Scottish ancestors likely wore indigo tartan; her birth parents' antecedents were Jewish "rag traders" and African slaves, "traded along the same routes as indigo, where a length of blue cloth was a common exchange for human life."

As she took her final gasps of air in a fire-scarred, abandoned East Cleveland apartment building last month, perhaps Miss Cloud also had questions for herself. Maybe she wondered about how she got into such an awful mess.
Lincecum hit the leadoff batter and walked two more in the first inning, spotting the Brewers a 3-0 lead. He had to pitch around a single and two more walks in the second inning and needed a nice play by right fielder Gregor Blanco and 50 pitches to survive the first two innings.
The right-hander yielded a leadoff single to Paul Konerko, who was replaced by pinch runner Brent Lillibridge. After A.J. Pierzynski fouled out, Rios lined a ball over the head of second baseman Jason Kipnis that rolled all the way to the wall in right-center as Lillibridge easily scored.

If Thibodeau didn't endear himself to Bulls fans while leading his team to the league's best regular-season record last season and winning Coach of the Year, his team's desperate performance in Wednesday night's stunning victory against the Heat should clinch it. The Bulls were without Derrick Rose and it didn't matter after a memorable effort sent the United Center crowd into a gamelong frenzy. For the second consecutive game, the Bulls willed themselves to a victory that gave them a 3 1/2-game cushion over the Heat in the race for home-court advantage in the playoffs.

Cancer treatments improved markedly in the 1990s. the first decade of the 46-year-old specialist’s career. Targeted therapies and clinical trials now foster hope for the grimmest of brain tumor cases. Landolfi is an investigator on some of the most promising ones. Pinpointed radiation can immolate cancer cells, virus DNA can be implanted into tumor sites, and a body’s own white blood cells can be removed and armed with cancer-killing antigen before being redeployed in the body. But there’s been no critical breakthrough, as there have been for some other cancers.

State lawmakers appear to be waiting for the California Supreme Court to resolve the disagreements in the lower courts, which would clear away some of the haze. But regardless of what the justices decide, there will still be major issues to resolve. The Legislature should stop waiting and fill in the many blanks in medical marijuana laws. That won't resolve the basic conflict between state and federal governments regarding marijuana, but at least it will clarify what the state's policy is.

•Beware the gales of creative destruction. Netflix became hugely successful and beat out incumbent Blockbuster because it rode the technological wave of the Internet and DVDs successfully. It did this by building a business model around web-based browsing of selections, prompt delivery, online recommendation systems and exploitation of "the tail of the distribution" by stocking DVDs that appeal to a small percentage of the viewing population. However, many of the capabilities and strategies suited for this business model were rendered obsolete by video streaming technology, and competitors such as Amazon that had similar or better capabilities. Netflix's missteps were due to an inability to foresee the consequences of the force of creative destruction, and thus to renew itself in the face of change.

Dear A.E.: James Laver, a British fashion historian and museum curator, first discussed shifting erogenous zones in the 1930s. He pointed out, for example, that in the '20s, female legs were exposed for the first time in modern history and became what he called the center of erotica. Then, he asserted, that the zone shifted to the back in the '30s, to the breasts in '50s, to the thighs in the '60s, where his zoning stopped. In more recent years, the navel and the cleavage-baring bosom have become the erogenous zones of choice. Judging by the New York fashion previews for fall, I would say the erogenous zone has shifted back to the legs -- not through short skirts but through deep slits that take the eye from thigh -- sometimes even the waist -- to the ankles. Stay tuned.
"He was talking to the Port Authority about a dead cat on the taxiway. It was a work-related call, and it turned into a silly conversation.

In my corner of the church world I see a another danger, in addition to the idols of consumerism or activism. It's emotionalism. We want to feel transported every time we come together in worship. We want music that moves us, preaching that is dynamic, prayer lives that are filled with ecstatic encounters with God. We want to be "on fire" at all times, and if we are not, we start carrying guilt or laying blame. Few of us want to be "ordinary" followers of Jesus, finding our satisfaction in quietly serving, carrying on with the spiritual disciplines even when we're feeling muted and weary. In that environment Chaplain Mike's advice seem like water in the desert. I don't have be "extreme," whatever that means. I can be solid, grounded, maturing.

“It’s a little piece of SOPA wrapped up in a bill that’s supposedly designed to facilitate detection of and defense against cybersecurity threats. The language is so vague that an ISP could use it to monitor communications of subscribers for potential infringement of intellectual property. An ISP could even interpret this bill as allowing them to block accounts believed to be infringing, block access to websites like The Pirate Bay believed to carry infringing content, or take other measures provided they claimed it was motivated by cybersecurity concerns.”

What makes "Rebirth of a Nation" so readable -- beyond the author's writerly facility -- and saves it from a descent into didacticism is Lears' skillful mining of original cultural references and his strikingly drawn portraits. This is particularly true of figures a reader already imagines knowing -- Oliver Wendell Holmes or Williams Jennings Bryan, for example -- and, especially, the great financiers. The concise portrait of the dominant Wall Street figure of the age, J.P. Morgan, is extremely well-rendered, as is the simple encapsulation of his all-transforming financial system, "Morganization," which essentially was the shift of a company's equity from interest-paying bonds to stocks that depend on earnings. (Unlike credit default swaps, it was a financial innovation that worked.)
"It's a legitimate issue," he said. "You're trying to catch someone throwing 98 mph in the middle of the game and it's not easy to see. A bunch of balls are going to go into (the field of) play with it there."

* Tiger Woods is back ... in the winner's circle. It was an important step in his lengthy comeback, providing a measure of proof that he's made real progress in his extensive efforts to rehab injuries and overhaul his game. But does this mean he's all the way back? No. Win a major, and we'll talk. But as a casual golf fan, I can say that Sunday was a lot more compelling with Tiger atop the leaderboard, stalking a victory. The sport needs Woods to be successful to draw casual fans like me. That's the reality. I can't wait for The Masters.

The Galaxy have lost starting centerbacks Omar Gonzalez and Leonardo to knee injuries with the most significant loss being Gonzalez, the 2011 defensive player of the year. Losing their anchors on the backline has resulted in Los Angeles conceding eight goals this season, tied for worst (Portland, Dallas) in the Western Conference. In an attempt to shore up the backline, the Galaxy acquired centerback David Junior Lopes from Chivas for midfielder Paolo Cardozo on Tuesday.
The complexity of Villa Mairea makes it seem more like a collage than a unified building. Outside, the form is L-shaped and covered in white stucco. It includes sod roofs, a row of oblique projecting windows and an organic entrance canopy. Inside, floors morph from wood to stone to tile, rooms are demarcated only by rattan-wrapped poles, and a staircase seems suspended by nothing more than plants. Maire Gullichsen also worked with Aalto and others several years before Villa Mairea to found Artek, which manufactures his furniture and decorative wares to this day. In fact, Aalto's almost as famed for his Bentwood armchairs and Savoy vases as his architecture. Consider that the last time you visited the Genius Bar at an Apple store, you sat on one of Aalto's High Stools. But for a bigger dose of his Scandinavian style, the Villa is still open, by appointment—so come to Finland and have a look.

Hygiene is another concern. While therapy horses in other settings can typically get by with a “bum bag” for manure, the associated bacteria just aren't acceptable in a sanitized hospital setting, Frasier said. That hasn't been a problem for Sprout, who lived for a time in the backyard of a woman who allowed him access to her home; Long says the experience helped him learn the difference between inside and out. And if nature calls in the middle of a hospital visit, Sprout lets Long know by pawing the floor; then, it's out to the playground for a short break, followed by another hour or so of spreading horse happiness.
