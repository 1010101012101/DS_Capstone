After reading this piece, maybe you can help me answer this nagging question…why do girls love bad boys?
Peter looked over at Abelle and desperately wanted to say something but could not due to the effects of the drug. Still wearing the robe, she just smiled back down at him touching Jennifer’s shoulder and whispering something in her ear. Jennifer quickly finished the phone call and bent down towards Peter getting just inches away from his face.

BUNGALOW: so our first attempt to refinance fell apart because of a bad appraisal. I started over with a new lender and we have a new appraisal on Monday morning. Fingers crossed it goes better than the last one! That also means we've had another month to pull things together. It's looking great! I will post a big update with new pictures after the appraisal.

It emerged at his trial that he later told authorities his name was David Maria-Garcia, insisting he was in fact from Morocco.
On a recent morning, D-boy was not settling down well to his schoolwork. Since he's a five year old boy, this wasn't too abnormal. Not wanting him to entirely disrupt my work with his older siblings, I decided to pull out something fun, but educational for him. I looked around on the toy shelves and found the castle blocks that he had received at Christmas.
However, "Lose 15kgs by the end of April or I'll kill you with this formidably large weapon", that is more what E@L is talking about. It sets a specific goal and ties it to a specific, um, reward - brains splattered everywhere.
Fast forward to the computer era. This is nothing but pure magic. A light keyboard touch, vast amounts of storage that doesn’t mean several filing cabinets taking up floor space, spell-check, the ability to print as many copies as you like… the thought of such luxuries was a pipe dream in my young years and, a couple of centuries before that would probably have gotten someone burned at the stake.
Beer school is now in session. Here are a few types of dark beers, and how I describe them. In all fairness, I describe them this way because the Alström Bros explain things so perfectly, and they always nail it.

Leaving the border (yes, they let us in), we made our way towards our destination. The highway was great, with lots of scenery, and, it was glorious day, sun shining and warm. Exactly what we were looking for. As we continued south, we realized we must be close to our destination. Lori went crazy all of a sudden as Kohl’s came into view. My worst nightmare, a shopping trip. I managed to feint left and duck right and got away. We arrived at our hotel, The Coeur d’Alene Resort. Very impressive. We checked in and at the same time booked an extra night. It seemed like a great place to spend a few days and there was lots to do. We headed up to our room and discovered a great view. Nothing adds to a stay somewhere than looking out your room’s window and seeing something spectacular.

I have only recently taken the health and fitness lifestyle seriously and I am not proud to say that I know very little about projects and efforts to promote health, fitness, and sports in the Philippines. For example: I only knew about the Philippine Rugby Team (Philippine Volcanoes) because of the controversial billboards that were asked to be put down because they were deemed "indecent."
I guess thats all I can share... Will try to exert more creative juices by this weekend. In fact I have another 3 LOs in progress...well it was last year's untouched LO so I decided to finish it. MUST! hehehe
Luckily for us, one of the bears decided to head off the path, down to the beach, leaving us an escape route. So, I pushed past my mother and made my escape. To be fair, I did pull her along behind me and did not completely abandon her to the other two bears. Not that any of them looked particularly interested in eating either one of us - they had salmon on their minds.....
Our current table was a hand me down from my parents and while it was a fine table it was pretty beat up. If you read this post then you know that I got a great deal on some new kitchen chairs last year.
The final paper of the consultation was Jeff Hubing on the “Purpose of Acts: A Literary Study.” Hubing argued that the prologue of Acts ought to include 1:1-22, not simply the first three verses. The programmatic statement in 1:8 is a the center of this pericope and the whole unit is a “resumptive prologue” reminding the reader of what the author as already said (in Luke 24) and what he will be saying in the rest of the book. This is something like “how did we get here, and where are we going.” To a certain extent this is like the “programmatic statement” in Luke 4, Jesus reading Isaiah in the synagogue at Nazareth. Hubing did an excellent job showing that the key vocabulary in Acts 1:8 (spirit, power, witness) is scattered throughout the book, but especially at key points.
Anyway, damn if it wasn't an excellent grill. Now, a bathtub is pretty deep, you see, and Jimmy is a short fella', he explains, so he trimmed the bottom one up so that it was only about 18" deep. Then he welded some stops so he could put some mesh steel in for a grill. And because it would get too hot to make the whole thing a grill, inside off to one side is a truck wheel that he puts his coals and any wood for smoke on, and you can either cook right over it or heat things up off to the side. He welded a pipe over the drain, and a thermometer into the side wall. Weld a chain to allow the lid to hold open without flipping back, re-bar frame to slide it in, a formica front counter and a couple of wheels, and you're in business. Or, as Jimmy says, bid'ness.

Later on, after I got involved and all the participants were made to apologize, a mother of one of the boys contacted me and told me that her son had acted the way he did because they had moved to the area from a small town in the midwest and they had never seen an "oriental" person before. I decided not to go into why I object to the word "oriental" and instead focused on what she was saying to me, this excuse she was feeding me. She was trying to laugh it off instead of taking it seriously. To be honest, it really bothered me, but it also gave me food for thought. It brings me back to my original point. We are still the silent, unseen minority. And sometimes we have to fight that overwhelming feeling of not belonging. Of feeling unwanted in a country we love and are proud citizens of. I know as a child, books were always my refuge from that horrid sense of being different and hated. But when I look at publishing today, I wonder if my kids will feel the same way.

It's kind of interesting. I normally think this means that like somehow God is all we need and the only thing that matters, and in some sense that is true. In comparison to all other things, for the Christian, one's relationship with God, or more important God's relationship with us, is of utmost importance.
BUT thats not the story I want to tell…
THE DIVAS INDIA by Victoria Christopher Murray
My role in the process of a book’s publication was designed to answer these questions for authors, as well as do the legwork obtaining media and publicity exposure. As someone with a variety of publishing experience – I worked at HarperCollins in Publicity, then Scholastic in Online Marketing Partnerships, and later became an agent with a boutique firm, which is why my company is truly a hybrid – I saw that publishing was changing fast, and that my diverse experience might actually help to navigate authors (and editors, and agents) across the digital divide from traditional publishing into new media.

Last week’s post about Susan Cain’s talk on introverts resonated with many from our community. In addition to the great comments on the post itself, I received several emails and have had quite a few conversations about the topic with both introverts and extroverts (and the parents of introverts and extroverts).
Light filtered in through the generous picture window of Sandra’s third floor condo. The moon reflected off chrome and glass tables. As she slid her hand across the smooth granite counter top a tear rolled down her cheek.

In the National League, though, that pitcher's spot was always there as a marker. If the pitcher was due up, you knew it would likely take some unusual circumstances to score -- a two-out rally, an unlikely single by the pitcher, an error or something. As a fan, I found myself subconsciously separating the innings, thinking about pinch hitters and double switches, doing the math -- sort of the way I do when watching a golf tournament and looking to see how many par-5s are left on the golf course or in football when calculating a comeback.*
Okay, yeah, here I go again with the Lego. I had to make another little sewing machine though. Somebody nice needed one of her own. A quilting/blogging friend, Cindy, who blogs over at Live a Colorful Life, has been very generous in supporting my book and helping spread the word, plus she is always very enthusiastic and encouraging about my quilting projects -- and did I mention she was a kindred selvage-obsessed quilter like me?
I gulped and the room span around me.
Am I spiritual? Yes. There are times where the wonder and beauty of it all make me feel like I am a part of everything, a piece of god that contains everything. Do I feel the need to worship a particular god? No. To me God is more than a name or creed. If there is a God, It is unknowable, it is neither good nor evil, it just is. It’s beyond all that we could ever understand.
Then I received the final email….”If you have not made a PENNY in this business” you need this other course for $ 395.00 on how to make money in the VO Business. Now don’t get me wrong…I have a coach, I believe in attending seminars, and getting involved in workouts, with real pros. It’s obvious to me that this person is in the business of making money off people who have a dream, but the sad fact is that this company has no real vested interest in the success of the students.
But you know what? It didn’t last. And I realize now that, even if I had reached my goal weight and size, I still wouldn’t have loved my body. If I wait until I lose the weight to love myself, I’ll never lose the weight and I’ll never love myself.
I believe my breathing stopped 20-25 times per hour. That is right per hour. It is no wonder I am always tired and no energy.

Sometimes, these shows have offered quality commentary—the “Abrams Report” early on, some broadcasts of “Greta” in recent weeks. Often, however, these programs feature little more than talking heads, with one adopting a pro-prosecution slant and another praising the defense.
She traveled from Earth to a number of suitable worlds, but eventually decided to set up her operations on a planet without a Stargate, hoping to avoid the attention of the other Lanteans and the Goa’uld. She was, against the laws of the Council, continuing to experiment with human DNA, seeking to create perfect, obedient soldiers. While her intentions might have been pure in the beginning, perhaps finding a way to combat the Wraith on land or retake Earth from Ra and the Goa’uld, after several years in isolation her purpose became twisted and corrupt. Soon, she had created a powerful and loyal creature called Goldar as well as a race of nearly mindless soldiers called Putties. She had stolen a Goa’uld ship to reach the gateless planet, and after she created her Putties, she loaded her equipment onto the ship and, with an upgraded hyperdrive engine, the ship set out for Earth.
There is no feeling worse than knowing you weren’t worthy of truth, of love, of sharing, of togetherness, of complete oneness, not even an incomplete one. Unrequited love curls itself in some secret crevice , wounded and bleeding. It doesn’t die.
For the egg patterns, I cheated a bit using Sally Hansen nail polish pens. In reading the instructions, you can easily wash off the pen design if you make a mistake using luke warm water. When satisfied, simply brush two layers of clear top coats to ensure your pattern doesn’t run. I might caution that the top coat you use should have a more thicker feel to it. What I mean is, I had recently bought Revlon‘s extra life no chip top coat and had used it to finalize the egg patterns. I found that the pen designs began to run because of the density of the liquid. It seemed almost water based. I had to redesign the nails and had opt in using L’Oreal‘s top coat instead which had more thickness to the liquid.
The traditionalists dislike the thinking.
I love this dress, madly. It was my first Modcloth purchase, and maybe my favorite. I think the print is perfection for spring, but the cool florals work equally well for the winter months, which is a fashion blogger's dream! Also, I like my milkmaid braids much better when I make them looser like this... I'll never go back to my old braid ways.

The good news is that I made it to all my meetings at least an hour early. I also got to see some scenic areas like my local park, learned some great short-cuts like the steps to the museum, and saw dozens of people leap from the path of my speeding car. I also learned some valuable lessons. I didn’t know that I could drive on two wheels, fly over a fifty foot gorge, and out-run three different police departments; all in the same day. I almost forgot one important thing. It seems that gravestones aren’t very good for the under carriage of my car.

Here's another card for the OWH shipment it's a MayBrit Bear that I colored a while ago then I added some pink paper and stretchy ribbon, rhinestones and a darling card to send to a young child or parent. I was happy to hear that OWH is soon going to pair down the cards since the President is bringing home the soldiers in Iraq. I love making these special cards as my way of saying thank you to the soldiers male or female for what they are doing for their country. Each and everyone of us needs to take a minute and say a prayer for all our soldiers and if you have a minute make a card for them, you can either send them to me or to OWH.com. Thanks for making me see I need to think of others which will make my life fuller in the long run.

Gradually, sorrow turned to resentment and rage. “City That Care Forgot” flings indictments both local and global. “Short version is, we gettin’ mad,” Dr. John sings in “We Gettin’ There,” which gripes about contractors and insurance companies and goes on to tabulate greater costs: “Ask anybody if they know a friend that died from suicide/They gonna say ‘Yeah for a fact.’ ” In the title song, a steadfast slow groove with jabs of bluesy guitar from Eric Clapton, Dr. John sings, “Better get used to that fonky smell/Toxic mold under the fresh paint.” And in the gospel-flavored “Promises, Promises,” on which he shares vocals with Willie Nelson, he sings, “The road to the White House is paved with lies.”

And on the gall bladder front, my tests were all normal. So at this point the doctor isn't sure what to do. I've got a new medicine to take before bedtime (since most of the time I'd wake up in the middle of the night with issues). The nice side effect of the medicine is that it makes you drowsy-- so I've gotten some pretty solid sleep the last few nights. The doctor will see me again in a month to see if things are improving, which they have been ever so slightly with each passing week. He thinks it might be viral or bacterial and something we just have to wait out (the ulcer didn't help things). So we'll see. By now I know which foods seem to give me problems and am just avoiding them. I'm allowed to start eating them again, but I figure I'll try again in the summer, when I don't have to teach 106 eighth graders if I feel like junk. On the bright side, I'm pretty much rockin' the skinny jeans.

I take no prisoners when I say that I find these tests to be totally irrelevant and meaningless, serving to do little more than massage the department of education’s ego and calm the anxieties of pushy parents who assume that good SATs results mean a good education and a good school.

As I prepare for her visit, I look around my house and what was once deemed 'clean enough' or 'that doesn't need attention for another week or two' quickly becomes recatergorized into 'tackle it before Mom comes'. For example, my kitchen floors that get swept once a week and mopped about once a month now need to be ASAP. And the walls all over the house, I notice, grew dirt and smudge prints overnight.

Wow, what a view! Notice the window frames are a permanent teal blue color and that also needed to be taken into consideration. The angle of the window was another interesting feature and because she doesn't plan on staying there indefinitely, we decided on custom drapes that frame the window on both sides that can be taken with her when she moves. So here is one of the design boards I presented to her and with some tweaking, she has moved ahead with her apartment. Can't wait to see the final results!
However, when your child grows up, she will be the one with the choice. If you want her to choose to continue to stick with you then, start being someone she would choose now. Start trusting, start accepting her now. Understand that the only thing you can truly control about your child is your half of your relationship with her. The only person you can control without fail is yourself.
As this site has become a great place for PKD fans to discuss the texts and media happenings, I've decided to invite a few readers and fellow Dick scholars to become contributors here. If you're interested in writing something or leading a discussion, please let me know. I'm thinking of remaking this blog more in the model of the Philip K Dick Society Newsletter with myself acting as the Paul Williams, editing and publishing work done by garage scholars and academics motivated by curiosity rather than currency. We've had great discussions about Palmer Eldritch, Maze of Death, Flow My Tears, and others. I'd like to feature more of these types of discussions, starting with "I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon" (also published as "Frozen Journey"). Get a hold of this story and I'll post some interesting discussion questions from my class in the next couple of days. Let's try to dig a bit deeper than this...

And because the MLS scheduler is a 12 year old, our best players had to fly in on a red-eye b/c they were playing in a Concacaf game the night before.

I'm talking we're in El Salvador, then LA, then Charleston, then Houston, then Puetro Rico. You are basically punished for winning.

At the event, I spoke to the many brides and event planners who attended about infusing their personality into the design of their event. I love graphic patterns so I wanted to infuse a bold pattern into the dessert table to show how I would bring a design that I loved into a dessert table. My thought was take a modern look that one might find on a Tory Burch tunic or a Jonathan Adler pillow (love them both!) and bring that into the event. With that, we created our own version of the classic greek key pattern for a modern and chic dessert table. We used that pattern for signage such as a backdrop, stickers, marshmallow flags, and candy bar wrappers. We had the "ridiculously talented" Cake Divas whip up a cake, cupcakes, cookies and petite fours using our greek key pattern. We even created greek key pattern flower sculptures using green mums. The idea is that you can take any pattern and color scheme and make your dessert table (or event design) completely your own. We had a "ridiculous" time creating this table and we hope that you enjoy our creation!
We asked them: How do you feel about this idea of “Western narratives” and the problems of inclusion within the sf “field”? for that matter, what are the problematics of some Western writers tackling non-Western settings for their novels, and do they result in exoticism? Fabio is currently raising funds for a fiction project on science fiction and colonialism. How do you see the two intersecting – both in fiction and in the world of publishing today?

I am carrying one of the oldest objects that I own today: the terra cotta figure of Serapis’ head that I obtained a few years ago (shown above). Serapis is, in many respects, one of the most important deities in my practice, and has had a way of shaping my practice for much longer than I realized. (I wrote about this in my essay for the Bibliotheca Alexandrina anthology Waters of Life.) Serapis’ status as a super-syncretistic deity, and understanding what exactly this means, has been very useful, illustrative, and illuminating for my own practices with Antinous. (And, it has also helped me to understand a few other such deities, like Sabazios, as well.)

Chaos theory is actually a case example of how deterministic our universe is, that it is deterministic to such a detailed scale. Chaos theory is really, and explanation of how a deterministic universe works. Lets take the weather, which Williams uses. Chaos theory, when pertaining to the weather, shows that a small change in conditions, like the classic example, a butterfly flapping its wings in Britain can cause a cyclone to develop in the USA, because the small effect can be multiplied out by larger forces, and a large force, like a huge line of industrial fans on the South American coast-line, can be neutralized by a small force, like a butterfly flapping its wings somewhere in the world.

I thought with clenched jaw, and since my attempts at fight had done nothing but sog up every soluble item in the house, and the still-gushing water was speedily transforming my room into an indoor water park, flight was the only option. My bare toes bounded across frigid rocks of the pathway as I searched for service, and I had the horrifying thought that my phone’s five remaining minutes of battery might die before I could reach someone.

I want to hold Piero Golia to his word, if not for any other reason than he says dazzling things. I had the pleasure of sitting with him on a panel once. The crowd was in a bad mood. We had a number of very bitter folks present, complaining about the artmarket, about artists that have the money for monumental studios, about the funding that bad artists get for unimpressive public projects, about the cool kid clubs that exist in every art community.
And I don't make those lists of things I did in the past, either. I can hardly remember what I did last week, let alone try to scratch out what I was doing a year ago, or heaven help me, a decade ago (this being a more pivotal, albeit still arbitrary date, people really seem to be taking this whole decade thing to heart).

Love never became a big concert draw outside of California. They did some weekend tour dates in the rest of the country, but it was only in their hometown of Los Angeles or in San Francisco that they played regularly. A stable income from concerts would probably have helped the band weather some of their personal changes. Changing band members seemed almost routine for the big L.A. groups in 1967/68. Neil Young quit The Buffalo Springfield, Gene Clark had already left and David Crosby was fired from The Byrds in ’68. The rock scene was so new and continually changing that everyone thought their “next” lineup or group would be even bigger than what they were leaving (ultimately true for Crosby & Young). Big ambition coupled with big egos created a volatile music scene, and Love was no different than the rest of the aspiring groups of that era. Personality conflicts between members, poor management and drugs were three key areas’ that could help break a band apart, and Love had its share of all three.

Each individual bag serves 2-4 people, which I would say is just about right. The bags vary in weight, from 1.5-7 ounces, (the varieties with chocolate are heavier, the salty/cheesy flavors are lighter).

A century later, in a world where France and Great Britain merged in the late 1950s and nuclear-powered Zeppelins encircle the globe, ex-journalist Victoria Valois finds herself drawn into a deadly game of cat and mouse with the man who butchered her husband and stole her electronic soul. Meanwhile, in Paris, after taking part in an illegal break-in at a research laboratory, the heir to the British throne goes on the run.

Of the acquittal, Dame Rebecca West wrote: There could be no more pathetic scene than these taxi-drivers and their wives, the deprived children of difficult history, who were rejoicing at a salvation that was actually a deliverance to danger. For an hour or two, the trial had built up in them that sense of law which is as necessary to man as bread and water and a roof. They had known killing for what it is: a hideousness that begets hideousness. They had seen that the most generous impulse, not subjected to the law, may engender a shameful deed. For indeed they were sick at heart when what had happened at the slaughter-pen was described in open court. But they had been saved from the electric chair and from prison by men who had conducted their defense without taking a minute off to state or imply that even if a man is a murderer one must not murder him and that murder is foul. These people had been plunged back into chaos.Chaos is the word. Chaos was the state of race relations in the south until the Civil Rights movement, when the chaos was at last addressed.

Here in Alaska, where wild salmon harvests are successfully managed, we don’t often worry about whether or not our salmon is wild caught–we assume it is. While there are a few farms in British Columbia that raise Pacific salmon, we can be assured that almost all Pacific salmon is wild caught.
Michaela Martens as Marilyn Klinghoffer partners Alan Opie in performances of great dignity, honesty and vulnerability. Their plight brings home the essence of this history of macrocosm and microcosm: two innocent, normal people are caught up in something not of their making and out of their control, their lives shattered as a result. The opera, at its core, is about how ordinary people are destroyed by world events. It is always the innocent who pay the price.
It is not surprising to note the numerous women’s magazines in the market today. There are many reasons for such an occurrence. Women are very complex creatures who have many aspects that can never be fully understood or potentials that can be realized. Hence, a women’s magazine is a very instrumental tool that can help its reader understand the fairer sex better.

It simply doesn’t get more romantic than this. Your own desert island paradise. Just you, him and eight kilometres of pure white sand. No rowdy night life, no glitzy shops, no crowded beaches or frenetic bar-hopping. Better still, there’s no TV, no phone signal, no Internet. In other words, nothing to distract you from each other.

His gaze fluttered up to that bedroom window again as he trotted across the county road. Had Zanna come downstairs yet? Did she feel as frisky and excited as a new foal, like he did? In his black vest, trousers, and high-topped shoes, with a shirt so white it radiated its own light, James trotted eagerly past the Cedar Creek Mercantile building and down the long lane that led toward the Lambright house. In less than an hour, Zanna would be seated at his side, trying not to wiggle during Bishop Gingerich’s long sermon before they got called to stand before this gathering of family and friends–
I die cut the label shape from some wood grain paper from Creative Imaginations and stamped the sentiment, starting with the second half on the bottom, and then stamped the rest right above it. Since you can see right through the stamps, if any of the sentiments are too long, you can simply ink up half at at time and use them this way instead.

He leaves me with all sorts of promises and an information pack. I decide to sit my daughter down in turn and talk her through moving. She sits silently for a moment then says quietly “I don’t want to leave my toys…” I tell her we can take them with us. She looks unconvinced. “But how do we carry them?” I tell her about the big lorry. “But we can’t take the toaster or the clock can we?” I tell her we can. “But who’s going to water the plants?” They come with us too, I say. I explain that it’s only big things that are left behind. “But what about the stairs?” she asks. “How will we go up if we don’t take the stairs with us?”

Last week, you may recall that the kids went on a public speaking frenzy, which was outrageously fun and inspiring. And exhausting. At the end of Friday, Eva, so proud of her accomplishments, also felt wiped out and emotionally drained. Teary, she longed out loud for a week off so that she could just what she wanted to do. I asked her what it was that she wanted to do. She said (in tears), “I want to make a Jabba the Hut body pillow!” You will be impressed that I didn’t even laugh.

I’ve been experimenting on some unwitting children. I found an episode of Andy Pandy on YouTube. It was an example of one of the very first British children’s television programmes (when CBeebies was called Watch with Mother). The episode was from 16th September 1952.

Long before zombies became such a problem, I helped save America by eliminating extreme radicals in rural areas and farm country such as crows, groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, and various targets-of-opportunity like tin cans, bottles, and even a few ABBA and Styx albums. I also became a pretty good shot facing away from my target and firing it over my shoulder using a mirror like trick shooters did in the old days.
Well, I have to admit that it's easier for me to talk about what historical periods I don't like. I am such a history nerd that I will read almost any historical-set novel. I even got my bachelor's in history, after changing from an English major. But, if I had to pin down one era, I would say that I love the Roaring Twenties.
Also, I suppose I considered yarn a useless word that lots of movie reviewers to describe, well, movies. It never tells me anything about the movie itself. Other than that the movie entertaining and aren’t all movies supposed to be entertaining?

Does size matter? Believe me, it does. I am of course talking about shirt size. Every now and then I see an article or a TV programme which claims that most women do not know their correct bra size. Women are encouraged to go along to have a fitting because they can be wearing a bra 2 to 3 sizes away from the correct one for them. You may have seen similar articles. If you haven’t perhaps you need to read your wife or girlfriend’s magazines more frequently. Anyways, I digress….

Make sure to communicate with your parents. I think that's all parents really want...is to be in the loop as to what is going on while their children are at school. Make a weekly newsletter, create a class website, send home a weekly behavior note, etc. Whenever you communicate info without parents having to ask, the less stressful your school year will be.

The ingredients should start to ball together, when they are just starting to form into a dough ball, take the ball out and kneed it a little to ensure full incorporation (you may need more water at this point). You do not want to put too much more icing sugar into the dough or it will be too thick and not as melty when eaten.

Eastwood seems content merely recreating famous incidents in Hoover's life and to be sure, the careful analysis of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping makes for interesting viewing, especially with the subplot of Hoover lobbying Congress to make kidnapping a federal crime, so his bureau could take over the case and grab any potential headlines.

The funny thing is, sometime shortly after the most recent pre-teen hissy fit about the amount of time I was NOT spending with them, I told my girls that I was thinking it was time to step back, and make some changes, and give up some time killing extra-curricular activities that I have. They were aghast. Where I thought I'd get three cheers, I got a resounding "Noooo!". I was shocked.

As many of you know. Far Guy has Atypical Trigeminal Neuralgia. He has had it since December of 2007. He lives with pain everyday. He takes anti seizure medication to help control the pain, without the medication he would not be able to endure the pain. The medications must be taken throughout the day, if he forgets a dose or is ill and cannot keep his meds down he is in terrible pain. Pain medications are useless…nerve pain especially the pain from the Trigeminal Nerve seems to have a mind of it’s own.

It is an unfortunate sign of our times that many citizens remain unaware or apathetic concerning the issue of indefinite detentions of persons deemed enemies of the state. One might expect more discussion of this in an election year. If not on a national level, here in Takoma Park, we have a chance to review the limits of presidential power and the degree to which security should or should not influence American ideals as laid out in our founding documents. I look forward to a substantial examination of the state we’re in and the implications going forward.

Granted Deakins has the budget to rent those 18K HMIs and any dolly he wants on his features. But he’s also not beneath using “cotton bed sheets” and 4 X 4 bounce boards.

Home Depot/Lowes works as well with those large 4X8 boards in the insulation area. (I forget what it’s called but it is white on one side and silver on the other. Just ask them to cut the board in half.) Keep in mind that Deakins spent many years shooting documentaries where he just had to make do with little or no lighting.

We were thinking a lot during this time of what bringing children into our home would mean, and how life changing this could be. We talked about what we would say if she called us with children much older than we had originally requested (since she had promised she would). We talked about fostering vs adopting, and how we felt about both. We talked about whether we were really sure this was something we were ready for, and of course spent much time in prayer about all of these questions.

If you want wood extractives, then you want barrels used for very young bourbon. Several distilleries (Jim Beam, Wild Turkey, Heaven Hill) sell a lot of 2-year-old bourbon to Australia, for use in bourbon-and-cola and bourbon-and-ginger-ale pre-mixes, which are very popular there. Those barrels still have lots of the original sugars, tannins and other substances in them.
Though the styling may not reach the giddy heights of the avant-garde European editions, in no way does Vogue Australia skimp on doling out pages of fashion fantasy that most of us can only ever dream of wearing. The difference is the impression I get while turning the pages is that I am being spoken to as a grown woman, in a way that conveys great enthusiasm for fashion, but with the recognition that most of us are not ladies who lunch or party endlessly, that we cannot and do not buy into everything new, that we read Vogue for inspiration and ideas rather than as a shopping catalogue, and that we might update our current wardrobes with something new if the fancy took us while still continuing to wear old things that we still love.

While he was amusing himself with his own game of watching, Pookie was having herself a great time. The adoration for children was something that the two of them had in common. She was sprawled out on a blanket, a slender hand (she knew it to be her mother-owner), being drawn across her back in a smooth and steady rhythm. Just as smooth and steady as the purr that came through a parted jaw. A quick lick across a fingertip that strayed by her face, and then she was off. A big fluff of white, with her equally fluffy and white tail perked up high behind her. She pawed off the blanket and across the grass, not straying too far, but far enough to catch the eyes of children. Ah, children. It didn’t take long for a group of three to kneel before her, coaxing her in. Pookie’s tail flicked back and forth as she moved closer, the damp grass against her paws, until their own little paws caught her up. Another purr later and she was soon stretched out across the grass, chin tipped up as a frizzy haired boy scratched under it. What a day. What a glorious day. Lots of petting and cuddles, fresh air and a breeze. She could lay there forever, simply soaking up the sun and the love. And perhaps she would have.. except a droplet had fallen down again. Another one followed, then another. It didn’t take long for the group to split up and her to be scooped up, as everyone ran to find cover.

I know it will be made into a poplar movie and will be translated into many languages. That’s why I want to keep all foreign rites. I also want fool plush animal sales.

And then I said it back. “I love you too.” I can’t, to this day, tell you why I said it back. Maybe it was peer pressure; maybe I felt it in some part of me. Maybe I wanted to feel it. But I said it back, and he looked so happy. And it immediately felt wrong. Like a lie. Or a half-lie, because I wasn’t there yet. I immediately regretted the words, but they were out. He continued to say them to me the rest of the night, he seemed so happy that it was out there. That we loved each other. Only I was slowly panicking. I just hoped he’d forget the whole conversation in the morning.

But I’m most proud when I can apply this all to cooking. I like shopping for food sales, and I like seeing what I can make that doesn’t cost much. Take, for example, the thing that has become my new favourite quick meal: rice with broth poured over it for flavour. A cup of rice in the rice cooker, some leftover broth from soup or stew or whatever I’ve made recently that has broth or juices that I’ve collected, and voila! A simple tasty meal that costs maybe $0.50 for all the ingredients I used. It’s not very varied, and it’s not a well-balanced meal, but it’s quick, simple, and delicious. And when you’re in a financial bind, half a dollar for a meal isn’t a price to sneeze at!

There are obviously many differences as well but the above is what is playing out. The US has never had a real estate bubble of this magnitude so it is hard to predict how things will play out. Yet we can analyze the data and hopefully arrive at some macro-economic conclusions. We can look at similar situations and ask why our pattern is looking very similar to the bust in Japan.

So personal confession time; I don’t know what it is about music like this, but it actually relaxes me. It soothes me. Maybe deep down inside I’m just a sociopathic hater of mankind, maybe I can’t wait until the Dark Lord rises up to take dominion over this world. To see the dawn of a new day when, to quote Black Sabbath, “Satan laughing spreads his wings”. Maybe I’m not the happy go lucky guy most people see me as. Maybe I’m someone you should just stay away from.

You may take advantage of her initially but her soul never gives up and by this i mean, ones she is off your craws you will end up questioning yourself, your guilt will destroy your ego and forever you will be walking looking down so ashmed of the man you became and all women will be so aware of you like fire.

So if you live here and have an established lawn (as we do) and would like to try to save as much of it as possible (forget saving the grass itself--people will berate you for having green grass--strangers will stop and complain about your wastefulness), you have to work at it. We, for instance, have a big plastic bowl in every sink with a bucket on the floor nearby. Wash your hands over the bowl, empty it into the bucket, take it out and pour it around the trees and whatever plants you're trying to save (the trumpet vine, for instance--the hummingbirds count on those). There's a bucket in the shower, one in the kitchen sink. You take showers and wash dishes in spurts: turn the water on to get wet, turn it off and lather up. Turn it on to rinse, turn it off to lather up your hair. On and off, on and off. You freeze, but you think about the trees that are counting on you, the birds and insects that are out there struggling. Any waste water that doesn't have soap in it goes into pans and bowls outside for the birds and squirrels and turtles. Rinse out the cats' water dish? Pour that water on the honeysuckle! Drop a piece of ice on the floor? Into the bucket! It's a messy, irritating pain in the butt, but you've got it way, way easier than creatures without plumbing and opposable thumbs.

Once the Krotons stop being all crystalline slurry they form into what looks remarkably like taller versions of the Quarks. The hexagonal based designs of the ship and these odd beings are actually pretty cool. Unfortunately the budget must have run out around about the actor inside's knees as we get a sort of metal looking skirt. The Kroton's are famous for having the rather unusual disposition of a Birmingham accent (Does every planet have a Midlands??). The Kroton's voice artists Roy Skelton and Patrick Tull were actually going for a South African lilt, to tie the story in with the serious then-current issues of apartheid, unfortunately it just sounds like some a couple of Brummies trying to take over the world.

For generations our acceptance that we are part of the Milky Way galaxy was unquestioned; yet this pathway in the heavens appears to rise from our earthly horizon at a 60º slant: odd if we are one sun within its great spiral of stars. It now emerges that the Solar System belongs to another galaxy which is currently colliding with the Milky Way.
The latest Republican proposal would raise the debt limit in two phases, with a smaller increase of about $1 trillion immediately, which would carry the government through the end of this year, matched by a similar amount of spending cuts. The second increase would depend on a deficit-reduction commission’s recommendations.

Over the course of The Lion’s Roar, sisters Johanna and Klara Söderberg inevitably return to folk’s great themes of love and loss several times, but they’re never covered as charmlessly as they are on ‘Emmylou’. ‘To A Poet’, for example, is quite inspiring in the way the Söderbergs face up to their heartache, explaining in spine-tingling harmony how, “I miss you more than I can take and I will surely break”, before concluding, “But there’s nothing more to it / I just get through it”. The deceptively upbeat ‘Blue’ is even more unusual, as First Aid Kit tell the tale of a depressive friend who’s not been the same since their lover died in a car accident, while a sweet shuffle of plucky major chords plays out underneath.
This book also has a Christmas Cracker, a Christmas Tree, a Candy Cane, and a Christmas Teapot. There is also a teddy bear, a frog on a lily pad, and a crinoline girl. I've continued to use the book all these years so I think it's well worth the original price.

The "Baby Got Back" video celebrated a woman's naturally appearance and that a woman didn't have to be rail-thin to be beautiful. Then, things changed.

I’m going to do this by showing how the ranking relations distinctive of value concepts that can’t straightforwardly be understood as types of correctness can be understood in terms of the structure of practical reasoning, which is itself understood principally in deontic terms, and thus in terms of correctness. All of this is implicit in Brandom’s account of practical reasoning, which I endorse. I’ve explained some of this before (in section 4 of this post, though it’s not completely accurate), but I’ll rehearse it again in order to introduce the relevant features of the account. The important thing to understand is the difference Brandom introduces between theoretical (or doxastic) and practical commitments, which, intuitively speaking, is the same as that between the ordinary notions of belief and intention: in undertaking the former one takes a proposition to be true (e.g., that expressed by the claim ‘Pete has climbed Everest’), whereas in the latter one undertakes a responsibility to make a proposition true (e.g., the practical commitment ‘I shall climb Everest’ makes me responsible for making the former proposition true). This intuitive characterisation isn’t quite adequate, as Brandom thinks the the notion of truth plays no substantial explanatory role, but it will suffice for now.
The current government has failed miserably in more ways than one in preserving, protecting and promoting a certain level of agreement between and among, the races, families and villages. The divisions are sharp, deep and deliberate.
The problem is that the vast majority of women have been so thoroughly conditioned into the idea that body hair is repulsive, unhygienic and masculine that from puberty onwards the daily ritual of frantic depilation becomes firmly entrenched, particularly when every other woman looks impeccably waxed and plucked and lasered.

Throughout my years in college, Poe, was my all time favorite American Poet. I love how he is best known for his dark and dreary works that are filled with gothic elements. My favorite poems by Poe are “Annabel Lee” and “The Raven” which both focus on the theme death of a beautiful woman. Because his poetry is so beautiful, I always catch myself reciting lines from them repeatedly in my mind, such as his famous lines from “The Raven”.. “quote the raven nevermore” and “once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary.” The lines from”Annabel Lee” that I cannot forget are: ” For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams; And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes.”

Not too much later, Jenny got in all the new spring colors and asked if I'd like to try one so I could write a honest review of them on the blog. Not one to ever pass up the opportunity for free products - especially ones I know I'll use - I of course agreed. As you probably know, Lil' Tulips has crazy fast shipping and so 2 days later I had a new tank in my hands. I held it and was underwhelmed. $15 for a tank that weighed maybe an ounce? It felt thin and unimpressive. The color was pretty (a deep purple), but it wasn't anything I was majorly impressed with. Plus - they are one size tanks, so I was pretty confident it wouldn't fit. I WAS WRONG.

Exhibitions are celebrated with a festive one-night social nexus for artistic contemplation. Originating from the top of a spiral staircase that connects two floors of an apartment at 1638 N. Western, the artLedge initiative lends itself to an endless number of exhibition possibilities. artLedge’s newest project, transcengressdension, opened Friday at 40000, one of the spaces in the WestTown Gallery Network. Clever as ever, artLedge came up with a list of the top ten top ten lists. So check back here everyday, as a new number (and new list) will be unveiled.
The opening line is a conscious echo of Edwin Muir, “The desolations are not the sorrows’ kin”, which is not on the internet but in the Collected Poems, available through Amazon. Do click to look inside: more than half the book is shared there, though not pp271-2, where The Desolations is. I recommend Song at p.146, an instantly accessible love poem, metrical and sweet; The Road at p. 223, because life as a Way is an image he returned to again and again, and Annunciation, also p223, because it is an image close to my heart now. Other verse I would recommend appears not to be shared, so, well, buy the book.

Last week in the post on Regency Era Women’s Fashions, we covered the terms “Undress”, “Half Dress” and “Full Dress”. These also applied for men as well. For men, “Undress” would include having his jacket and cravat removed, something that was not done in polite or mixed company if the gentleman could avoid it. Dressing gowns and robes also fit this bill for gentlemen lounging at home. “Half Dress” for men would be less elaborate knots in their neck cloths, much simpler and more casual styles of clothing. “Full Dress” and “Evening Dress” are the equivalent of today’s black tie affairs. Almack’s was a special case, where gentlemen of the ton were expected to wear breeches instead of trousers.

This story has a lot of missing links. It is a tragedy when relationships end in homicide. Are the days over when parting ways actually worked? Do we need to speak on gun control? It is notable that too many women and men are being killed in domestic disputes from gun usage. These are apparently law abiding citizens where are allowed legally to purchase a weapon, then something happens and they abuse that privilege. Yes it is abuse of privilege when you irresponsibly remove a gun from it’s safety place and decide to commit a crime with it. There is no fight in a marriage that is worth murder is there?

In closing, let us consider what light is shed on these matters by the attempted terrorist attacks in Stockholm in December 2010. There were two bombs in the attack. The first one was a car bomb consisting of a primitive explosive device (possibly containing fireworks) and a number of liquid petroleum gas canisters. The gas was ignited by the explosive device but did not itself detonate, and caused only minor injuries to a small number of passers-by. This must be considered a severe failure, and is indicative of the type of problem that will be faced by would-be terrorists who lack access to chemical precursors, the technical expertise to formulate them into a bomb, or, in all likelihood in this particular case, both.

Now you’ve had a brief introduction to the team, it’s time to talk turkey. This was Thunder’s first year as a team. They had a bit of a shaky start, having a hard time for the first few tournaments.

Then, at the Kick Or Treat Tournament Diablo FC hosted, where the players must wear a costume to play, Thunder went out in full Rock Star fashion; painted faces, dazzling smiles and special uniforms, placing second.

You’ll recognize them by their fruit.” We had a family discussion the other night about fruit and how you might truly discern the fruitfulness of a person.

That's it. Yep, it makes it easier to vote and brings everything in line. Nothing to see here. Vote YES.

Design law requires that the form of a design not be solely dictated by its technical function (Article 8 of the Regulation).

A matter that can potentially attract considerable controversy has recently been brought to the notice of the Spicy IP team.

Since these two decisions, the German government, policy makers and industry-owners have been known to have raised quite a hue and cry about the domestic protectionist standards and regressive IP regime in India, as well as lack of adequate enforcement mechanism to IP owned by foreign entities. However, the table seems to have been turned insofar as the German judiciary is concerned, as the following matter is likely to reveal.

He puts the money he has with him in an envelope and hands it to a dealer, asking her to give it to his dad. She tells Kiwi to take the money himself, that the man, Sammie, is a nice guy who they all love. Kiwi takes off, conflicted over what he's realizing. All these years, he believed his dad went on periodic month long trips to the mainland to meet with investors, but, it looks like those business trips were just periods when he works at jobs like this one.

When I was a young girl, there was an “elderly” spinster living in the house across the road. While I thought she was old, in reality she was perhaps not far past retirement when she came to live in our street. My memory tells me dimly that sometimes I would be invited over for a cold drink and I suppose a biscuit. I faintly recall lots of quality furniture in the house and the story went that she was well off. I suspect she possibly wasn’t all that well off as she had worked as a typist or secretary throughout her life.[i] Having been trawling through Trove I’m wondering if perhaps she is the “Miss Daisy King” who was secretary to the Brisbane Chamber of Commerce.

These new marketing channels change all of that. These marketing channels are inbound; not just outbound. Each one of your Facebook fans has already volunteered their age, sex, interests, etc. Everyone who visits your website and signs up for the email newsletter opts in and probably gives you the information about themselves that you want (within reason). You can also track when they clicked on what. There is still interpretation of data to figure out your customers, but what used to be guessing is now statistical analysis. There are plenty of these new inbound marketing channels, and some organizations have been very effective utilizing them. This is where we are today.
You don’t have to give wedding favors. They’re not a mandatory item like the wedding bands.
“Not really,” he said. “It didn’t do her any harm and it did me a lot of good. Once you get used to burying your face in a woman’s bosom, you do whatever you have to to make it happen again.”
So I planned to start the party train today. Didn’t know how or what, maybe just putting together a Lego set. But even though I got up early I didn’t have time today to do the whole birthday thing. It’s not that I had a lot I had to do, it’s just that I spent the morning doing little things I wanted to do, like call some companies while they were still open since I could. Then at about 2:30 when I was exhausted and didn’t want to get any more done, I still had the stuff that had to be done tomorrow left to do. Clara’s room had to be made ready for her new furniture arriving tomorrow. I had to finish the worship stuff for PWOC. If not for the gotta do’s I would have decided it was break out popcorn, candy, and a movie at about 3. But then it hit me, today isn’t the start of my birth week, today would be Lori’s birth week plus one day. So all my hard work this morning was just knocking stuff out of the way so that I can really celebrate Lori’s birth week, without little things hanging over my head.

The top image is one of a fan that I found at a brocante some weeks back...Made of parchment type paper with a wooden frame, the face of the fan is handwritten with a mix of Italian and French language...I think the fan is some kind of travel memento celebrating a trip between Turin and Paris in 1891...This piece was in beautiful condition and the handwriting was so well preserved that I thought it deserved to come home....It has a new life in our sitting room now and has seemingly travelled from Turin to Paris and on to Saint Rémy de Provence...
By the way, notice how my copy of Bread and Jam for Frances is in black and white with blue washes? At the time the book was printed (1964 - this was a book club copy I got through school), color printing was still both expensive and tedious. Illustrators had to meticulously make color separations by hand, with separate transparencies created for each color used. These were done in shades of gray and took real skill. That's why the old books often had only one or two colors. I feel very fortunate to be able to do my illustrations with full color and any media!
I modified the recipe by slicing the eggplant rather than cutting it into chunks. I also used lean ground venison instead of lamb. For my gluten-free friend, I used sorghum instead of flour, and I couldn’t taste any difference in the bechamel.

It's rare for me to want to cook because I have a super stressful day job and don't have time or energy to cook, especially on weeknights - and weekends I usually want to get out and eat my way through town, as much as my wallet will allow, anyways! Plus, anything I make would be disappointing compared to the often life-altering experiences I can have eating what the pros dish out! But when strolling through TheHFM, I do find myself inspired by the ingredients to throw together rustic meals that I know will literally only take minutes to make but taste good (because the ingredients are incredible).
First of all let me tell you, this is the diva of all cookies. Secondly let me tell you that I've still made these 3 times even though only about half of my cookies turn out each time. Worth it? Yep. Also this cookie is made from a mix so it only takes about 3 minutes to put together.

The Stoics believe you have no control whatsoever over your life, what happens to you, or what you achieve. The only thing a Stoic believes you can control is your attitude. For the Stoic, the ideal attitude was to be calm and free of passion. If one was able to attain this virtue, then one could be happy, regardless of what happened in life, making you immune to misfortune.

But with keeping in touch the girls have had several chances to say hello again, and good-bye. And here is where the difference in their personalities really shows. Saying good-bye is difficult for Lyla. It breaks my heart that she is so sad everytime we say good-bye. And it breaks my heart that Lily has had to learn to cope with so much that saying good-bye doesn't appear to be hard for her. She has had to learn to survive and letting something like your best friend go, cannot break her. Life goes on. How many times did these little girls have to say good-bye to their friends through the years?

It isn’t a particularly great sandwich. It’s an above average torta, better than La Victoria, but not as good as Los Reyes. What jumped out at me here, though, was the milanesa. The milanesa, cousin to the Italian cotoletta and the German schnitzel, is a thin slice of beef spiced, dipped in egg, dredged in breadcrumbs and shallow fried. That last step was the downfall of this particular torta, as the milanesa had been fried well before it ended up on my sandwich. By the time it got to me the coating was a bit damp and well detached from the beef in places. In spite of that the beef was tender and the whole thing hinted at what could have been. A crunchy coating on a tender piece of beef, creamy avocado, just the right salsa…it could have been something really special, had it been well executed. I finished the sandwich a bit disappointed, but now certain that there is a torta out there, a transcendent torta just waiting for me. So I went looking elsewhere.

We refer, of course, to yet another explosive-laden rocket, fired entirely indiscriminately around 12:30 this morning in the general direction of where the Jews live. Reports of the attack says the missile landed somewhere (details are deliberately sketchy, always - if you have to ask why, you should not know) in the Hof Ashkelon region of southern Israel in the early hours of this morning, Thursday. As far as we know, there were no injuries to people, no damage to property.

Just like with war all cultural battles are won by those with the most pocket change to throw about frivolously on non-essentials. Well, as far as adult beverages go the idiot followers of the craft beer movement have plundered and pillaged the ranks until only their kind can be called king. So you get $25 bombers full of hops, sugar plums and the pipe dream tapioca of every idiot's medulla oblongata gone to mush put inside a bottle and sold to the highest bidder.
My only regret is not doing this sooner. As a teacher (and parent!) you are told NOT to punish your child for going the bathroom in their pants and to wait until they are ready. However, Brent was past the point of having the ability to potty, he was just choosing not to and was quite content with his decision. I had to win that power struggle in order for him to realize he did not have a choice. It was hard, and I felt horrible, but I feel like it was necessary due to his personality to move forward. Now that he is making the effort, I am not punishing him when/if he has an accident, but I don't have to, because he feels bad enough already. Before, he was doing it out of spite. That alone is a HUGE accomplishment!

"You have the perfect amount of time each day for the things that matter most. The key is spending time on those things. Few would boldly declare, 'Today, watching television for two hours was one of the most important things I needed to get done.' Yet that's where we sometimes spend our entire evenings. The operative word in the phrase "enough time" is not time. It's enough. And the truth you should accept is that you will probably never have 'enough' time to pursue your dream. But every day somebody somewhere is making magic with less-than-enough time he has. So can you."
I even pipe the ganache "mud" over the top of the cupcakes in a little circle, leaving the middle bare for the caramel placement. The caramel looks and smells so delicious that I'm undergoing a serious bout of self-pity. On the other hand, it doesn't stay as soft as I'd like to it be. Although it softens easily in the microwave, I can tell that it's not going to remain as soft as I'd like it to be on the cupcake. It would surely rip my temporary crown right out of my mouth. How embarrassing to have to return to the dentist with the crown stuck to a big hunk of caramel. Apparently temporary crowns fall off with alarming regularity, or so I assume based on the many hits I got on my Google query regarding what to do when your temporary crown falls out.

As far as the women's movement is concerned many believe the rot set in during the late 60's, when those who aspired to parity with men were replaced by radical lesbians or fanatics who viewed all sex between men and women as acts of rape and scorned contemporary attitudes to femininity as subjugation. However, I doubt that even the most man hating of bull dykes ever thought they would see a day when women believe they can gain respect by exposing their bare bottoms.

I was all set to go with the carnival theme as I love the sparkle and bright colours involved, but my mojo disagreed. When the ideas don't flow it's usually because my mojo isn't happy with the path I've chosen. Fussy little blighter my mojo... So, I gave it a re-think and looked into Brazillian artists instead. One person stood out from the rest and still satisfied my need for bright and bold. Step forward Romero Britto - Brazillian Pop Artist and fave of the Rich and Famous apparently!

“I LOVED your response to the atonement argument... The best part is that it felt like truth! It resounded with my own experiences and struggles and my own journey with faith and testimony. I had been trying to use the atonement in a way that it was-n't meant for. I was begging to be cured. But now that I have accepted who I am and what that will mean for me, the atonement HAS healed me. I went from the spiritually, emotionally dead person trying to change something core to himself, spending all my energy and time trying to "fix" myself, to a person who has come to love who he is and has been spiritually awakened with a new and greater understanding of God and excitement for life! And just like when Lehi partook of the white fruit, my immediate reaction was to reach out and share what I had found with others in my situation. Wow- thank you for your clear and thoughtful response.

That evening when I got the mail I discovered a note from my bank that my reimbursement check had been "returned" and that $265 in my checking account had been placed on hold until they could get things straightened out. So there was a problem. Neither of my Friday afternoon payments had cleared yet, and with the hold in place, one of them would bounce. And, of course, it was after 5 p.m. on a Friday.
Crisis after crisis was befalling Paul. He was being spared from one danger only to be faced by another. He was still in the city of the Jews and they were determined to be rid of him. But now he had Rome on his side. God was using a pagan godless empire to afford him protection.
Another lady sits about 20 feet behind me. Part of my job is to check her work and, if it’s correct, release it to the customer. She’ll wordlessly sidle up next to me and place her printout in my tray. I’ll take it, read it, press a few keys on my computer, and we’re done. We’ve teamed up together to successfully complete an admittedly small project, all without ever offering each other even a grunt.
That policy can be viewed at here. Given their non-involvement in the later stages, it is interesting that the cover-page of the housing policy highlights UdeCOTT as a main state agency in its implementation.
I was pedaling slowly along approaching the intersection. An older lady was riding in front of me. She had a cute little girl on the back of the bike and I was laughing at the little girl. She was looking all around in amazement and smiling. I was just thinking of how cute she was while they stopped at the crossing ahead. All of a sudden a guy on an electric china post bike accelerated down the sidewalk onto the road and ran right into the side of the lady’s bike. ( She was in the middle of the zebra lines). It wasn’t a hard crash and the look of shock on her face was priceless. In slow motion she lost her balance and gracefully tipped over. She managed to get a foot on the ground so the bike didn’t completely smash to the ground. The lady wasn’t hurt at all and the little girl stoically took it in silence. A few people rush over to grab the little girl and make sure the lady was ok. The guy on the electric bike said sorry the best he could and he was trying to keep the laughter off his face. The people who rushed over to help were also trying very hard not to bust out laughing. The only person who didn’t find it amusing was the bike rider herself. The helpful pedestrians pointed out that she was indeed in the crossing for the traffic from the other direction.

They have also had a strong impact for democracy activism in Burma, forcing some companies to stop supporting the dictatorship, and leading others to forego commercial relationships with it. However, such ordinances were challenged by a business trade group, the National Foreign Trade Council. (We saw that corporations exhibit great unity against activists, and also that they readily engage in litigation!) The NFTC argued that the Burma ordinances (specifically, Massachusetts’ Burma purchasing law) constituted foreign policy, and that only the federal government, which in the present day is beholden to business (i.e., elected officials are beholden, for their campaign funding), has the right to create and enforce such policy.
Mr Sheridan asked the witness again if he had had any dealings with Glenn Mulcaire or if any check had shown up any invoices in the aliases he used (Paul Williams and John Jenkins). Mr Bird repeated that he had no dealings with Mr Mulcaire. Mr Sheridan then asked if Mr Bird was aware that Greg Miskiw was Mr Mulcaire’s “handler” within the News of the World. The witness replied he did not. Mr Sheridan put it to Mr Bird that Mr Mulcaire had an “exclusive contract” with the NotW but Mr Bird said he had no knowledge of that.
That night I sat in the bathroom until I thought everyone was just about to fall asleep. I slipped into my bed as that hush that you only hear at the end of an exhausting day at camp fell over the room. I lay there breathing and trying to work myself into enough of a terrorized state to sound convincing. Then I opened my mouth and said in a shaky voice, "What is that?!? Oh my gosh guys! Snake! Snake!"

Heart disease is a broad term that includes a number of diseases that affect the heart and the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. Due to this reason, there are a large number of heart diseases and it is possible that an individual may suffer from different types of heart diseases at the same time. The heart beats throughout the lifetime of an individual, collecting impure blood from different parts of the body and sending it to lungs for purification. It then collects pure blood from the lungs and pumps it back to the cells all throughout the body. Since it is involved with supplying oxygen and nutrients through the blood to different parts of the body, malfunctioning of the heart has severe consequences.

Over the last couple of years I've noticed an increasing number of decorating books being organized by room. This results in a parade of entry halls, living rooms, dining rooms, bedrooms and on.

The important one is, simply, “Can we shed migrant workers when the good times are gone, thus avoiding yet another increase in the social welfare budget?” To which the answer is an unequivocal ‘no’. And thus by recognising this, we get the answer to the other burning question of the hour: should we import skilled labour, or retrain our own? To which the answer is an equally obvious “Retrain our own”. The wishfully unthinking fluffy tendency are still struggling with this agonising decision, but the rest of have got it. Just a shame they run the country, not us.

It would be nice to think poetry for a while, to breathe the emptier spaces of the page and move to a rhythm that generated itself as it progressed, to feel the slight drunkenness of careering through the forest of words powered by curiosity and the faint scent of subject.

My job is constantly putting out fires. Correcting mishaps. Teaching and reteaching. And picking up, clearing out clutter. Go to bed. Repeat. I used to wonder what stay at home moms actually did.

And when I was working full-time and traveling to exotic places like Minneapolis and Green Bay, it seemed a lovely thought to be at home with kids some day.

They had me scheduled for weekly appointments to make sure my cervix wasn't getting any shorter. There was no change in my cervix length the week following the big gender ultrasound, and the Dr. mentioned that I might just have an odd cervix and it could be just fine the rest of the pregnancy. To speak in numbers, my cervix was measuring at about 23 when it should be at 35. So not great, but not horrible. It stayed at about a 23 for those 2 weeks in a row, so I fully expected that there would be no change again at my appointment last Wednesday.
I am hoping this year will be more sane. I want to bake and sew and garden AND work. I like working, just not until I feel like I am exploding.
Ephesians 1:3 declares, “Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in Christ.” In other words we have it all. Every born-from-above believer, everyone who is living in Christ, has every spiritual gift we need to reflect God’s wisdom. If we are living in Christ, He positions us to experience real life and reflect His wisdom, which replaces the wisdom of the world. Living in Christ also positions us to be right with God and be His righteousness. And living in Christ puts us in a position to be set apart, or consecrated, for reflecting His wisdom in our lives to others.

I went with this cute image by Whiff Of Joy and colored her in different shades of turquoise. I used the same colors for the backgrounds. I cut out the image and put it on some paper that I heat embossed using white embossing powder and the "Sandy Speckles" Wheel by Stampin´Up. I also added some glitter on the spots. Also the blue paper behind the circles has some glitter on it and to finish the sparkle look I added some rhinestones.

Hello, Fire Enthusiasts.
The theory of cognitive dissonance as elaborated in When Prophecy Fails indicates that many people who have invested deeply in a prophetic scheme, with a specific date set for a catastrophe, will not react to the failure of the predicted event with disillusionment. They will merely seek for a way to … explain away this apparent failure. And history has shown that one of the most typical ways to do this among religious movements is to “spiritualize” the date. What this means is that “something” happened on the date, just not the “something” expected by the True Believers.
On rare occasions when I felt brave, I’d counter with, “But it’s rated PG. You’ve let me see PG movies before, like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.”

The following are ‘democratic’ States I would describe as capable of having a massive influence on the economy and money-transmission systems of planet Earth: the Unites States (sheer size), the United Kingdom (banking centre), France (bulwark against Merkelism), Australia (raw materials), and Greece (raw materials and financial contagion).

Of course, I couldn’t say anything to him after that, because I knew that even if I tried to speak, I wouldn’t be able to. The intoxicated aren’t the world’s most sober speakers, you know, and drunk as I was with absolute joy, I knew I wasn’t in any better condition.

Islam it seems is now in a better position to deliver the final blows of our destruction than even the old soviet union ever was. Our ancient adversary has been imported back by our modern foes to deliver the coup de grâce when we are at our lowest, our numbers diminished, our spirit broken, our history lost and our lands invaded.

I decided the ends needed a little bit ... more ... to it, so I cut out circles of fabric and added fabric type flowers. It added a feminine touch without being too girlie. These two fabrics are leftovers from her quilt too, so once I start speaking to my sewing machine again, this will tie in perfectly.

I was in Kuala Lumpur city over the weekend shooting a wedding. As with alot of weddings in this corner of the world, there were alot of cultural aspects to the day like the tea ceremony, and the door games to win the bride. And I am going to profess - it is rare for me to be putting up wedding photos on the blog, so soon after the wedding has happened, but I was asked to put together a same day edit slideshow (ie. images shot on the wedding day, and then shown on the same night to the guests) for the wedding over the weekend, and after looking at the images, I felt I had to share. I hope you don't mind Hwee Yen and Jon. I was just so encouraged by what I witnessed between you and your families, that it left a rather deep impression within me.
On the other hand, many owners earn not only a salary for managing their business, but also the ‘investors’ premium’ that reflects a fair return on the risk capital invested in that business. These businesses, not coincidentally, also require less time to manage and have fewer people issues. Not surprisingly, they sell quickly and for a premium.
I trust you are not angry with me.. or even disappointed in my decision to go to DC for the Cherry blossoms…..

My next “weed-out” involves Best Picture winners who rightfully beat the movies it was up against, but weren’t as good as another un-nominated movie that came out that year.. I’ll grant this opens up the discussion, potentially to a huge number of movies, so I’m limiting the “other movies” to ones that were nominated in at least one other category.

Ironically, one of the reasons it can age that gracefully is that I don’t think it’s a particularly good novel about its time—La Farge sets the novel in 1915 but I only know that from his preface. There are indications of traditional Navajo practices, especially artistry and religion, and they often feel very vivid: that’s the strongest historical piece here. But the relationship to white Americans is left very unexplored. La Farge says a few harsh things that needed to be said in 1930, but too much cannot be said in that context, and so it isn’t. The book is revealing about children taken away from their families to the “Indian Schools”, but in a limited way—I don’t think I learned anything I couldn’t have guessed. I feel things, though, that I had already known—feel them in a much deeper way—because I empathize with the characters. Maybe that’s the best way to sum this up: this isn’t really a novel that intends to talk about America, but its characters may bring home some ideas about America you’d already considered. The big caveat here is that I have no idea if this is an accurate novel about the Navajo. I assume, given La Farge’s sincerity and his first-hand experiences with the Navajo, it is likely as accurate as an outsider could make it. If I’m wrong, and he’s botching big things about the Navajo culture, then the book should be downgraded more in this category.
When the draft is broadcast tomorrow night, there will be large amounts of time between picks, and at some point the Mel Kiper Jr’s and Brian Billicks of the sport will make ridiculous commentaries on how a young prospect is a good pick/bad pick, but they don’t have a clue. The NFL teams have workout days, combines, interviews, and even one of the strangest written tests to help them gauge a future prospect. They’ve been using this format for decades, and still aren’t certain about their prospects. Major League Baseball finally started to fess up and admit scouts were using outdated techniques as was the main topic in last year’s hit film, Moneyball. If even one of these pro scouts had a lead pipe lock format for selecting picks, they wouldn’t have enough fingers to put all the world championship rings on.
Wow what a week it has been. Last Sunday night two lambs were born and then a couple of days after that another one came (thankful it was not another set of twins). The problem with these events is that now that winter has come, it seems to want to make up for all the lost time and the temperature is just dropping and dropping. Now according to the internet grown sheep with their wool can survive up to -40C but lambs get into problems below -10C. Cool you say insulate the barn, but here's the hitch, a barn has to be well ventilated, if not the sheep might get pneumonia and other nasty ailments. As it is expected to be -30C sometime next week, the barn will drop to -20 or so, I will be heading to Riga to search for a heating lamp or I guess we will have to bring the mama's and babas inside the basement - which will not be as easy as it sound LOL (hysterically)

I know a lot of people say a good reason to get rid of the death penalty (in addition to its “inhumanity”) is the fact that it is prohibitively expensive. When I found that out, I was a little surprised by the fact that people were willing to put a price tag on the limits of justice, but I suppose in these days of 14 trillion dollar debt, pennies (or dollars) matter, and I’m willing to concede that point.
Since she was already an old lady, she started to be herself. She wasn’t afraid to be judged, because old ladies can pretty much get away with anything. When Howl met her for the second time, he knew about the curse, and tried to lift it. Howl was successful on lifting the curse, but Sophie was the one who didn’t want to change back to her original age. Sophie was using the old woman, so that she can act like herself, while wearing a mask. During times in the film where Sophie would return to her real age, I think those were the moments that she wasn’t feeling conscious about how other people will see her.

You know how every class has that one creepy kid that no one likes? The kid who eats paste, likes to play with bugs, says random shit, etc.? That's Fuckle. Except a whole lot worse, I suspect (I refuse to spend time with this Ted Bundy reincarnate shithead of a kid, so I don't know for certain). I mean, the kid has no friends and has been “bullied” by a five-year-old (did I mention he's nine?). The weird kid.
Contrast that open, easy-drinking appeal with the tart, tightly-wound, sometimes musty and dusty complexity of a saison, and it's clear that saisons are forever going to be marginalised. Saison is the riesling of the wine world - loved by those in the know and in the trade, but largely ignored by everyone else. Good riesling smells of diesel, wet stones and lime blossom. Good saison smells of hops sacks, old wooden spice racks and cellars.

Now that many of us have completed the horrendously difficult Eighth Wave phase of transmuting, integrating and paving the Way out of total Darkness for all interested parties, now we’ve got to learn how to Consciously Create from within ourselves and our High Hearts and BE what we’ve worked so long and hard to accomplish during the past 12-plus years. Now we’ve got to adapt to increasing Source Energies beginning to flow through us, our bodies and brains like it never has before while in physical bodies. Now we’re learning to DO by BEING; to understand by knowing on our own internally and not externally through other Beings, Guides, channels or sources. The Ninth Wave phase is graduation time for many of us Starseeds, Lightbearers, Lightworkers and Wayshowers. Pay attention to whatever you too may need to cast-off and permanently let go of so that you can more easily BE.

But if you do it, and you know you do it, try to stop. Or at least try to make yourself less obvious. It's a harmless thing, really, but it can make someone who already feels pretty freaking iffy about their appearance feel more like a turd with two legs. The person you're scanning, she probably knows that her jeans are out of date, that she doesn't have the right purse/haircut/makeup. She doesn't need your bitchy up and down sniff of judgment.
All our French neighbours love it and once I had told them I had tried it they were full of useful advice, it seems (from my understanding) that the cleaning and tenderising were correct, but I think next time I would get my husband to use his fish filleting knife (which is ultra sharp) and make the slices far thinner.

I responded stating the word “father” meant more to me than simply a sperm donor. The term father means a man who will raise a child with respect and dignity and be there through thick and thin. Meanwhile, the term “biological father”, again, gives too much credit to the boys who are “man enough” to impregnate the mother yet shirk responsibility and run away.

The so-called “Food Safety Act” represents the camel’s nose. Once the ungainly beast secures an entry into our food supply, the ears will follow as just a little more regulation is deemed necessary. Our beneficent, all-knowing leaders will then decide that if some regulation is good, more is preferable, and the camel’s hump will sidle into the tent. Small farmers, gardeners and survivalists will complain about the camel’s stench, and Big Brother will respond with a “reform” package, the Food On Our Labels Safety act….FOOLS. The new reform will firmly place the entire camel inside every tent (except those who can afford exemptions). Food variety will suffer, and food production will dwindle. Our future will include Mid-East petroleum, Chinese manufactured products and South American food. The best way to avoid the camel’s stench in our tents is to kill it before it comes in. It is past the time for open season on camels.
For a kid, the fear of getting in trouble or the fear of looking bad in the eyes of a parent is HUGE! Kids want more than anything to feel loved, especially when they are not at their best, or when they've made a mistake and are already feeling pretty darn crummy about it internally. If they tell a parent the truth and that parent reacts badly and punishing, it only validates that internal feeling of zero self worth. So many parents do that though, they punish lying harshly and cruelly.

See? Once real people and real places and real events get forged in the fire of fiction, you can't tell what's left of the reality, it simply doesn't relate to 'reality' in the way Greer, and the Muslim protestors, assume. 'Writers should beware of hanging the carcass of their imaginations around the necks of real people,' she says, but it ain't like that, novels can't be divided up into the reality bits and the imagination bits, it's just one big meld, and the only real 'reality' of a novel is the author's psyche, and if it's a good or great novel it will have the reality of emotional truth.

Death is funny though, returning – full circle, because in it I find such a sincere beauty, and quite obviously a surreal sadness. On one hand, that person you loved so dearly is no longer here, and because of that, we feel sad, depressed, alone. On the other hand though, I find myself falling in love with every single memory I have of her, even the bad, even the ones of her in hospital beds, ones of her with IVs in her arm, ones where she was too weak to move, or speak, or smile. I find myself remembering anything I can about her, perhaps even just in fear of forgetting. But with those memories uprising, I feel happiness.

There is a method to this madness, however. There are certain chocolates that I consider to be good and there are others that I consider to be crap. Thus, I want Heidi and Piper to develop a discerning tongue for those chocolates that are good over the ones that are bad. I hope it works.

Steve, Joe, and Levon talked while I was away, and by the time I rejoined them, they were all good buddies. I got myself another glass of that water, sat down at the kitchen table, and examined the photos on the wall. I didn't see Bob Dylan repped there, but I did see endless photos of musicians I knew and didn't know, playing right here and elsewhere. I began to truly take into my heart that Levon, our endlessly kind host, was the personified zenith of rock n' roll history and, furthermore, was someone who'd not lost his connection to what was going on even today.

New Year’s Day
Technically, his first screen appearance came during the opening bank robbery, but to those of us assembled at the Moolah for the midnight premiere of The Dark Knight, the Joker didn't really make an entrance until he came strolling into a mob meeting a few minutes later. After months of feverish anticipation of Heath Ledger's already legendary performance, the crowd was amped to respond to even the most simple onscreen affectation, but nothing could have prepared us for his dispatchment of a grunt who happened onto the wrong end of a pencil. To say that the place exploded would be an understatement -- it was the equivalent of Clark Gable's revealing the bare chest beneath his shirt while dropping the bomb on Nagasaki. In that one moment, Heath exceeded all of his own hype, and in the process set a new standard for cinematic malevolence that has kept us little fanboys in thrall ever since.

Today we lose sleep over rogue nations like Iran developing nuclear bombs. It seems as if we are at the dawn of a new arms race where everyone seems to want to have their own nuclear stockpiles. Then of course there is the specter of terrorist groups and nut jobs getting their hands on a nuclear weapon. One thing that prevented all-out war between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was the concept of M.A.D. (Mutually Assured Destruction) which kept generals and leaders from losing their cool and automatically launching missiles for any reason. It’s unlikely many of these nations and terrorists will hesitate to use a nuclear weapon.

In order to compete, each woman must bring the head of a man. The Amazon women enjoy a fine existence, except for once a year when they must breed with men to further their race.

The 1960s brought us many things. For one, blacks were fighting for their rights and freedoms in the good old U.S. of A., the British Invasion was being led by 4 young men with style to kill and women were introduced to a little friend known as “The Pill.” Even with those things, there were a few smarty-pants brainers who were working on something that would change the future and they knew it. By the 90s, their little invention would be introduced to offices, schools and homes and would allow everyone to send information faster than ever! Also, they used it to pass pictures of naked ladies to their friends, but that’s beyond the point. What was introduced in the Internet was a way that we could get closer to the people in and out of our lives in a way that had never before been seen in any period of human civilization. For the first time (by the 2000s) you could know what the guy or girl across the street was doing for breakfast without even calling them for a “how do you do.” But with that came a way for us to create new personas. We could be anyone, and we liked that. The power we possessed, it was…..sexy. We could say ANYTHING and people would listen simply because it was there for all to see. We were the creators of our own media, whores to our audience. And as any good whore knows, you need a customer ‘cuz solo work isn’t putting food on the table. And with that we turned our friends and families and anyone who would hear our monologues strummed from the strings of our brain harps into our Johns. Because if they were buying, well baby, we were selling. And so began our transaction.
We let shame get in the way of our self worth. We think less of ourselves. And then this feeling unworthy affects our relationships. Our parents, siblings, friends, lovers– they don’t understand why we think so little of ourselves. They don’t understand why we can’t look them in the eye. Why we can’t seem to feel loved. We take our feelings and put them onto God– but not in that, “give it to God” kind of way. Instead of handing them over, dropping them at His feet, we pile them up as high as we can– all our issues, our shame– and we let it form a wall between us. We build it as high as necessary so we can’t look in His eyes. We hope He can’t see ours, either.

Flight attendants fall ill after wearing ‘toxic’ uniforms which ‘make their HAIR fall out’: “Hundreds of Alaska Airlines flight attendants say their new uniforms are making them ill. The attendants have complained that the outfits, which may be contaminated with a toxic chemical, have caused itching, hair loss and other unpleasant reactions. In a letter to the company’s president, union leaders representing Alaska Airlines employees demanded that the uniforms are changed. The Association of Flight Attendants says that 280 flight stewards – roughly one in 10 of the total workforce – have suffered from the side effects since the new uniforms were introduced last year. It is thought that the smart navy blue suits, made by TwinHill, may be contaminated with the chemical tributyl phosphate, a toxic substance used in synthetic textile manufacturing.”

4. Mayfair. Nobody else has a voice like this. This is off of "Fastest Trip to Cybertown", their last record, and the one I listen to less. This is honestly an indie rock track, something like R.E.M. would write, only with a more active bass line - remnants of progressive metal are difficult to shake off. It's catchy and melancholic, but it lacks that edge that makes Mayfair's first two albums some of the best progressive metal there's ever been. There's many bands that play indie rock like this or better than this, I mean. Nobody's ever made anything like "Behind" as far as I've found. I checked the song name and it's "Waterproof".

Ever since she got assigned to track down the neighborhood nice guy Moses Bedemier, people keep trying to knock her off and it's starting to freak her out.

My Views: This book was good. It ends the series, but I don't think I want the series to end. I like this family and want to keep following them. This book also made me very mad. I personally wanted to go thump Cole upside the head and tell him to wake up! I felt all the pain and range of emotions that Dianne felt and delt with. I recommend this book, but make sure you read the series in order so you know what you're getting into! Oh and did I mention Dianne has to give up "her" ranch?!
Having said that, John Iamarino knows that some of his schools have fewer options than others. That’s the nature of the SoCon and its disparate membership. It would be interesting to know which school drew the commissioner’s wrath for its less-than-acceptable scheduling. If I had to bet, I would put my money on Chattanooga.
4. The CCGPF has concluded that there's a direct "causal connection" between wastewater discharged into the T-T infiltration beds and the transport of that effluent via the subsurface groundwater "conduit" to the numerous seeps--downslope--outflowing to the west and northwest into Namskaket marsh and Hurley's Bog. This effluent stream has now been established as a "point source" under the Clean Water Act to a degree of scientific certainty. The discharge of effluent at T-T is already having a "direct adverse impact" on Hurley's Bog and Namskaket marsh that will become more pronounced under the projected discharge scenarios in the CWMP.

Gallstones (subsequent gall bladder removal) – In roughly November of 2003, I had severe indigestion and upper abdominal pain. For about four months, doctors at an urgent care facility (the one of it’s kind here at the time) kept telling me that my blood work didn’t indicate the need for an ultrasound (because they are so hard to do, right? ) to look for gallstones. I was repeated told I had IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and given medication that NEVER worked. But one day (roughly February 2004) the pain was so bad, and so high up, the only thing I could think to describe it was that I felt like I was having a heart attack. I knew I wasn’t having a heart attack. I was only 26 years old at the time, for crying out loud. So, for safety’s sake, my husband called an ambulance. Their initial EKG showed nothing wrong, which we expected, and they took me to the emergency room. The doctor there basically said he knew exactly what was wrong and skipped waiting on the blood work to come back and brought in an ultrasound machine. Yup! My poor gall bladder was filled to the rim with stones. I told the doctor what the other doctors had said and he was actually pretty pissed. He gave me some pain pills and referred me to a GI doctor. A short time later, I was admitted to the hospital for surgery to remove my gall bladder. I was pretty much told that was the standard, and only way, to deal with gallstones. I had it removed. I was shown acorn-sized stones that had filled my gall bladder over the past few months to the brim. Everything had gone well and I thought that was over. Boy was I wrong! A few years ago, when I began delving into natural remedies, I read that there ways to rid of gallstones without surgery. I was like, “Okay, coolness. Too bad I didn’t know this then.” But, when we saw the nutritionist for the first time, she explained that, despite what modern, conventional medicine says, yes, we do need our gall bladders. She explained that without it, my liver has been overworked and unable to properly digest my food, namely fats. All my food was being digested the same way, no matter what. Cholacol, bile salt supplement from Standard Process, was added after my first evaluation was complete and the difference was amazing! I will have to take Cholacol the rest of my life now. While I’m glad I have this option, as a prepper, I hate knowing I will be forever dependent on something I can’t get easily on my own. Aside from that, once this lifestyle change and healing is complete, it will be the ONLY thing I’m on! All my conventional, modern medications are now gone and I couldn’t be happier about that. So, as with the adenomyosis and endometriosis above, if you have gallstones, please contact me before opting for surgery. I’ll find some resources for you to look at to see about trying to get rid of those bad boys without resorting to unnecessary surgery. (*sigh* obligatory disclaimer: No, I’m not a doctor!)

There are some destinations — including New York City, San Francisco, and Miami — that are known for expensive dining, entertainment, and nightlife. It might sound counterintuitive, but these are actually some of the best places for vacation rental value. If you choose a vacation rental in New York City, you will usually have the added benefit of a full kitchen to use instead of paying for breakfast every morning or running into a café every time you have a craving for a cup of tea.

I blame my husband for our weight gain. He and I were (are) the typical "oh so in love" couple when we met. He pampered me like crazy! Took me to dinner, made me dinner, made me breakfast, brought me Starbucks, took me to lunch, etc. You know the drill. We had a great time, consequences to our waistline be damned! Now my clothes don't fit. His shirts suddenly got bigger. Dang it! How did this happen??
As soon as I saw the photo of these Almond JamTartlets in a recent issue of Elle à Table, I knew that I had to make them. Simple to execute, big in flavor and satisfaction, these Mirlitons – oddly enough, kazoo in French (why are these called kazoos?) – were the perfect midseason snack, getting their big fruity flavor from my favorite jam or jelly (in my case, cherry and blueberry), something always on hand, no matter the season. A handful of finely ground almonds or hazelnuts creates a dense yet tender filling, all nestled in my favorite, delicate Sweet Pastry Crust.
This box of wooden blocks dated way back to when I was a child.
¡Alambrista! is the story of Roberto (Domingo Ambriz), a farmworker from the central state of Michoácan. The film opens with his life in Mexico. Roberto lives in poverty, but is certainly not miserable. He works the fields with an earnest attitude and it is clear he lives in a loving household. The opening shots are marked with signs of life: water flows, crops are harvested, and, in the same montage, we witness the birth of Roberto’s first child. This introduction marks one of the only scenes to mix fantasy with reality. The rest of the story adopts pure realism, not surprising considering Robert M. Young’s background in documentaries (National Geographic specials and a short entitled Children of the Fields).

The Belgian judiciary decided to try him before the penal court in Charleroi. He repeated his statement and that he would be honoured to go to jail for this. He added that Jesus too had been persecuted! In a sermon he called upon the faithful to accompany him to court. “We will turn this into an excursion, driving there in full buses.” The Aramaics are a Catholic minority in Syria and Turkey and speak an old Semitic language, which Jesus and the apostles used and so are a link with Christ. Mel Gibson used the language in “The Passion of the Christ". On his website and in sermons Father Samuel warns of “the islamic invasion” of the West and that Muslims are invading Europe and we face impending civil war. According to Father Samuel “so-called moderate Muslims do not exist". (10)

Well, this one isn’t going to win any points for originality, but fortunately it has a fair amount of laughs and some generally likable characters that drag it up just above mediocrity. Though, it almost undermines its entire premise in the first 10 minutes by having our geeky hero’s ex-girlfriend played by a rather attractive actress as well. Sure, she’s annoying, but why is this guy so lacking in confidence if he’s already dated an attractive girl in the past?

The scourge – a short makeshift whip with several tails – was finished. Jesus rose. Within him rose a flood, deep, penetrating and passionate, like a force field, filling him, surrounding him in those first steps to the table of the nearest merchant. A loud crack split the air of the temple. Everyone who heard it felt it, as if it had fallen on their own skin. A sweep of the scourge sent containers and coins tumbling. Jesus said something, he scarcely knew what. ‘Take these things hence – make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise,’ was what others heard.

Many years ago my sister Brenda threw a little Olympic event of her own. It must have been the summer before she went off to college. She was a lifeguard at our beach. There was a mob of seven to ten year olds, on the beach that year, including our own little brother. After several weeks of swimming lessons Brenda decided that this merry band of little boys and girls needed a reward of sorts to celebrate their stellar achievements. She orchestrated a field day with swimming, running, a bit of jumping and even a sand castle contest.

Besides his classic fresh pasta sauce, one dish that he taught my mother to make was Pasta e Fagioli, (pasta and beans). This hearty, peasant-style pasta dish filled with beans and the holy trinity of Italian vegetables, became a staple in my house. When I came to live in Israel, I didn’t bring the recipe with me, because, I didn’t bring any recipes with me, and it seemed that this dish was to become a thing of the past! But when received a gift of the classic vegetarian cook book “The Vegetarian Epicure”, in it was the recipe for Pasta e Fagioli. Rediscovered, I followed the recipe and it was perfect, conjuring up the exact taste and aroma that took me straight back to Uncle Tony’s kitchen, in Cape Town in the 1980s.

The last thing I want to mention here is character motivation, which I've discussed before but which bears mentioning. Setting up a character's fundamental motivators is very important, but they're a little like a push off the wall in swimming. It'll get your swimmer pretty far, but not all the way to the other side. Each plot event or interaction will change the character's trajectory slightly, and the character's response to events acts like the swimmer's stroke. That additional level of moment-by-moment motivation can drastically change the action and the result.

While Beuys would make a metaphysical postulations about primal conditions of heat and conservation, Palermo just seems to ask questions like, “Can I get something from the Utopian forms of Malevich without buying into his mysticism?” or “Can I just have the dynamism of basic shapes playing intuitively on a canvas, sensing a purpose in the play yet not needing a reason?” Palermo’s funky result is Composition with 8 Red Rectangles, 1964.
My mother-in-law was here for a week, and left a few days ago. It was nice to see her, and I'm glad that T and the kids were able to visit with her. It was nice for me to see her, too, although there were some difficult moments for me. She has become a stream-of-consciousness talker, and seems to say anything that pops into her head without thinking about it or editing her thoughts. I think she just thinks that at her age, she's earned the right to say anything she wants. I try to let it go, but it's not always easy for me, especially when she says something that sounds critical. I mostly just tried to stay calm and not complain to T while she was here. I really wanted him to have a good visit, and I am mindful that she is not a young woman. I want to make happy memories for my husband and my girls. It was funny after she left, though, to compare notes with T about the things she had said individually to each of us, and to hear his responses. I tried to be polite and calm and NOT say what I was thinking in those moments when she said something unfortunate. He took a totally different tact, and left her have it (in a humorous way), and really gave her a hard time about some of the stuff. Anyway, I'm glad she came, and I'm glad to be free of company again.
I would then do my best, after a day of class and hours of film editing, to explain to him what we were studying. Never did I ever go toe to toe explaining to him why it was important. He’s an expert in the PR field. I would think he’s probably a master at making things that are vastly unimportant sound important. How could I compete with that? It was usually 4 pm and I had likely been in class all day! If he needs the ego boost so he can feel that PR is more vital than game studies, fine! I’m happy to allow him to sleep at night in the comfort of his home knowing that making a vapid starlet look smart or a company who poisons the planet look friendly is dishonest, but at least its more useful then studying video games. Sure! As John Lennon once said, “Whatever gets you through the night.”

You start out in a small dream that one of the characters, Ross, has in the middle of the night. He awakes from the dream to receive a phone call (“at three in the damn morning”) about a job that requires his skill and expertise. Naturally, Ross accepts the job, and he’s on a plane with six other individuals. Panning across the plane, you see a mustached man, a girl, a relatively large bald man, another woman, an African American man, and a barely clothed woman. This group is known as Team Jericho, a group that doesn’t truly exist according to the government. You then learn that each individual is skilled in ‘arcane arts’, and the group deals with Covert Occult Warfare, a ‘fancy euphemism for witches with guns’. The first character that speaks is Rawlings, the mustached man. His voice entertains me because it’s as though the actor is trying way too hard to sound like a Southern American bad ass. He briefs you and your team on the mission you will be required to complete. You learn that an old friend of Rawlings, Leach, is a core of the problem. Leach and his Brotherhood of Dark Rapture are trying to gain access into an area called Al Kali by using dark rituals. So far, this sounds pretty interesting. I don’t want to give the ending away at all, so I’ll just talk about the game play and a few of the levels.
Thank you for your patience and please drop by again to see what I've made.
Although I can’t let go of language entirely, I do manage to sit for a long spell in a wakeful hush. I keep my eyes open because I wish to see the stillness, not escape from it. The panorama I see is hardly wilderness, and yet every blade of grass, every bird and twig courses with a wild energy. The same energy pours through me. Although my body grows calm from sitting still, I rock slightly with the slow pulse of my heart. My breath and the clouds ride the same wind.

Do you remember my Halloween Silhouettes post? Well, I decided to make a different one, only with Tinkerbell. I have always loved Tinkerbell, and I'm kinda passing that love onto my daughter. So I made her a Tinkerbell Silhouette for Christmas. I had a few 12x12 boards left over, so I painted on pink, cut the foam to 3x3, and mod podged some green polka dot paper onto it. I used a light purple vinyl for the pictures. I did Tinkerbell and the other fairies that are on the cricut cartridge that I have. To fill in the other ones, I did a butterfly, a flower, one of the homes of the fairies (looks like another flower), and a mushroom.

Microsoft mogul, futurist and America’s richest person has, with help from billionaire buddy Warren Buffett, convinced nearly 60 of the world’s wealthiest to sign his “Giving Pledge,” promising to donate the majority of their wealth to charity either during their lifetime or after death. He is no longer the planet’s richest person, but that’s because he’s given away $30 billion to his foundation. The Gates Foundation, the world’s most influential charity, tackles tuberculosis and polio and funds famine-resistant crops to fight hunger. He is calling for a higher sense of urgency in AIDS vaccine development and also pushing for better tools to rate teacher performance. Gates holds 70% of his wealth in investment fund Cascade, dabbling in everything from autos to hedge funds to Mexican Coke bottler Femsa; the rest of his wealth is held in Microsoft stock.

Angels don’t glorify God in the same way we do. They certainly glorify God by protecting His people and carrying out His will, I think that’s pretty much a given. But they don’t understand His grace. The devil will never repent; Jesus did not die for him. The fallen angels will not be saved from their eternal doom, and the good angels haven’t fallen in the first place and therefore don’t need salvation like we do. The angels don’t understand God’s grace like believers do. This means that we can magnify a part of God’s character that they just don’t get: His grace. It seems to me that the fall of mankind was all a part of God’s plan to have us forever sing the glory of His grace. This is the big picture of how God works our own sin into His perfect plan.

Then again, maybe it’s just me. What I don’t fully understand is why it generally has to be preceded by the word “real”. You don’t generally hear people describe something as simply a humdinger, but rather, a real humdinger. Why is that? I suppose I could look it up.

I felt really confident in this outfit even though it was a bit out of my personal style comfort zone. I wanted to take a bit of a risk and I did with this ensemble.
Hello everyone! I hope that you all had a great weekend! :) We had a great time with our family and we went to Michael’s first t-ball practice so that was fun.
Healing, not vengeance, shall inspire my days.
I picked those up when I was in Bangkok, Thailand at a weekend market. I bought them thinking I would be able to use them for a birthday party in the future.

Hey, hi! Sorry to leave you staring at my dream reverie posting, as I'm fairly certain that hearing about other people's dreams falls somewhere on the "looking at other people's vacation slides" boring scale.

You'd think there would be scores of poems written about the White Horse of Uffington, but the only one I can find is GK Chesterton’s immensely long ‘Ballad of the White Horse’ (written when the Horse was still thought to be as recent as King Alfred’s victory over the Danes, and much more about Alfred than the Horse). I think these lines from the poem do still suggest something of the Horse's wonder and power.
Now, I was completely shocked. At once I felt terrible for this man, but at the same time I couldn’t help but wonder in sheer amazement at the fact that this happened. I believe I was rendered speechless, a feat so rare it has the tendency to catch people off-guard.
6. In the pot, back over medium heat, brown the onions. Return the meat and cooking stock to the pot, and add the raisins and remaining thyme. Place in the oven. It will need to braise for about 2 to 2 ½ hours. The meat should be extremely tender. About halfway through the cooking, add the potatoes and cook until they are easily pierced with paring knife.
The other thing Belisarius was good at was having a sense of diplomatic and personal integrity (which weirdly foreshadows the best of kinghtly chivalrous behavior – to be redundant – in the Middle Ages), and having concrete, long-term goals that showed he was thinking beyond a thirty-minute horizon (something we’ve lost in the 21st century, where short-term gain ALWAYS wins out over long-term prosperity).
Currently, anxiety has become my middle name, but, thanks to wonderful blog friends who have shown me that it's okay to admit when you are going through a rough time, I feel blessed. So, when I received this gift on my dad's birthday with the saying "a little bird told me", it was a wonderful reminder that I'm not alone.
The most common companion flower in vegetable gardens is the marigold, as various species of Tagetes repel some pests and of course are lovely in the garden. I find that snails feast on my marigolds, especially the yellow ones, in such profusion that I needed to find some alternate flowers!
Don't judge me- I am purposely waiting until the end of March before our engagement picture session so my roots look nice & blonde :) In the mean time I am seriously stressing out on how bad they are!

"Now,” said the Old Storyteller. “Whose turn is it to choose tonight?” The youngest of the North children, whose name was Gerdal, shyly put up her hand. The Old Storyteller lifted Gerdal onto her lap, and pulled out the magic pouch. “Dip your hand in, my dear, and we shall see what we shall see.”

Variable quality of tunage kept Class Actress off the top spot, which this year is occupied by Destroyer's ninth (!) album Kaputt. Who hell they? Apparently, one Dan Bejar of Canadian band The New Pornographers, plus various mates. After enjoying Kaputt, I went back and explored the band's previous oeuvre (thank you, Spotify) and was underwhelmed. It was well-made indie pop but somehow unengaging. Kaputt, though, is a different kettle of fish altogether; lush, romantic, a little like Avalon-era Roxy Music, as others have pointed out in reference to the reverbed brass arrangements. To my mind, though, the sax, flugelhorn and trumpet on the album (probably synthesised- the sleeve notes refer merely to "instrumentation") resemble most of all the plaintive work of the great John Gatchell, the trumpet player on Soft Cell's Torch. If you like any or all of the Pet Shop Boys, Moose (and I will get around to giving them their due, I promise), The Aluminum Group (ditto), or any of the artists on Le Grand Magistery records, you'll like Kaputt.
I wish sometimes things were easy but of course they are not what is in life.
The to do list grows everyday but it is all outweighed by the space. We have gone from a house of 170sqm to over 400sqm. From 4 bedrooms to 6. From 2 bathrooms to 3 and from a carport to a double garage. We will never complain about the extra space here. It was the whole reason for this move and we are loving it. Case in point - this is the kid's playroom. It ajoins a huge lounge room that is also theirs. Yes they are loving the space too. Eventually I'll turn this into a sunroom with some cane lounges, floating floorboards and paint it all white. In the short term I've managed to pull down the lovely mustard curtains.
I made the jump a full cross rail of about 2'3" and he kept jumping it until he got tired. We cuddled a bit while he caught his breath. (Most personable horse ever!) I was so pleased with what I saw out of him and his desire, so I figured that was enough for the day.
Add the sliced eggs and fold them in together with the potatoes and masala. It is ok if some of the yolk gets mixed with the masala, but don't over do the stirring bit.
He is colored mainly with E31 and E35 to go with the base grays. I like the E30's sequence because it is a good, neutral brown family, without too much red or other tones in it. The more you layer browns over the base grays, the more the grays will be pushed out of the way, so be careful not to layer too much or you may lose the original shading. If this happens, just darken it more.
Dear Reader, the second NFL double-header is almost over. I’m glad that Mr. C has had time to watch something he clearly loves ……it’s evident by the way he talks to the TV downstairs, cheering when the going is good, muttering his disapproval when the going is not so good. But now I think Mr. C will be the happy recipient of a French lesson…..

In one week's time I will be a national speed limit.. So my Dad keeps reminding me! The big 3-0, scary times! lol I have to say that I have actually struggled with it, I don't know why exactly.. I remember a few years ago my fella said to me 'You'll soon be 30!', and he said it in quizzical way, as if to say aren't you bothered.. And I thought at the time, its no big deal, who cares, its just another 2 years older, what possible difference would it make. But oddly, it feels a big deal.. however its pretty likely that its not a big deal in any way shape or form! I guess I've spent too much time watching Youtube videos of young girls with their fresh teenage skin, no grey hairs, no cares in the world and suddenly here I am, noticing a few wrinkles here and there, my grey's winning the battle over the brown's(!) and a few other things! Thankfully Im coming around to the idea and its not a big deal.. Although Im sure I'll go through something similar when Im reaching my 40th too!

We all have movies tucked away that few other people remember or saw. These hidden gems tend to be some of our favorites despite whatever critical negativity they received or how poorly they did at the box office. Often these are the movies that are rarely run on cable or network channels and if they are it’s at 3am when only on the night you can’t sleep do you end up re-familiarizing yourself with it. Now just because I mention a movie as a hidden gem doesn’t mean no one knew about it or it didn’t have any popularity, it simply means it’s kind of been forgotten about.

Then my dad got a Mango Crumble ($12SG ~$9US) a delicious tart with mango wedges, light coconut cream infused with Vanilla Bourbon tea, topped with crunchy crumble biscuit, and scoop of Alfonso tea ice cream (black tea blended with rare mango). Every spoonful of this was pure heaven with fragrant tea interplaying with fresh, tart mango flavors.
It wasn't until last week that we had another appointment with the occupational therapist responsible for Maddy's oral motor training that she suggested a particular special needs spoon called the Beckman EZ spoon that we really saw major improvement. This spoon wasn't designed for use for cleft palate kids - but given the size and shape of the spoon, it is very easy to get small amounts into the sides of her mouth where she can easily swallow it. Immediately she went from eating very little to finishing entire bowls of solids! Although she still struggles with anything which has any texture, preferring very smooth purees.

I have to admit, I’ve been slacking on my prayer time. But then, God always been patient, and He always gives me a chance to start over. I miss those quiet moments when I talk to Him and I listen to what He wants to tell me. I can never thank Him enough for everything that He has done for me.

Continuing the recent theme of award winners we come to this happy guy. Why does Mike Caldwell look so glum? Is it because of the terrible air-brush job on his card? My bet is that his expression is the standard one that results from two-plus years of pitching for the worst team in baseball. Mike revives the non-Traded traded card posts at what may be Shea. He'd been a Padre for the '73 season but after it was traded to the Giants for Hall of Famer Willie McCovey and outfielder Bernie Williams (NOT the guy who would play for the Yankees or any relation to him). That can be tough to be traded for an icon. Just ask Charlie Williams. Mike had what might generally be called an interesting year in '73. The closest thing the Padres had to a closer, he put up generally good numbers and added ten saves but his record was pretty discouraging. But pretty soon things would improve and down the road they'd get a LOT better.
Eventually, everyone was awake and up and getting going for the day. CPT and Joe and Paul ended up going to the West side for some errands. They got sports equipment for Baseball season, and some new shoes for CPT for work.
Olivia put on the jumpsuit as the officer watched intently. As she put it on she noticed only two of the four snaps actually worked. She could see in a nearby mirror that her breasts were clearly visible from the sides and if she leaned over, the top portion of her neatly trimmed pubic hair was exposed.
Thanks to the palpi on its colostrum, they are able to identify the property of the nutrients and one of these beetles’ main characteristics is being able to live with the ants in peace. While the ants feed these beetles on purpose, the ant-loving beetles benefit the ants with the liquids they secrete from their bodies. The fossil pictured is evidence that these beetles haven’t changed or undergone evolution for 25 million years.
Shocked now I stood astounded unsure of what to do. Well how often do you get to see the darkness hopping around on one foot foul mouthed and dribbling? No you are correct it is not a common sight.

If the allegations are verified, what happened would be a deep violation of fundamental ethical principles and among the most serious crimes known to the legal system. Such conduct is completely unacceptable both within the university and in our society at large. If the truth of the allegations is upheld, it will call for severe punishment from the courts and from Duke’s disciplinary system. This university has cooperated and will continue to cooperate to the fullest to speed the ongoing investigation by the police, and I pledge that Duke will respond with appropriate seriousness when the truth is established.
I cannot review the film in any capacity without admitting Heath Ledger’s portrayal of the Joker steals the film. The praise heaped upon Leder’s performance was not just posthumous sentimentality. He would own the role even if he had not tragically overdosed months before its release. Some speculate the role may have contributed to his damaged state of mind. The Dark Knight’s version of the Joker took the most demented, homicidal elements of the character and put them on screen.

First, let me say that I love Yankee's smells. (Not to be read I love the way yankees smell.) However, I've found that Yankee candles don't last as long as they should for their price tag. They tend to burn unevenly, and as such you're left with a lot of wax and no wick to burn at the very end. Ultimate sad face for a candle.

C. Record low snowfall amounts this winter: NOT EVIDENCE. Weather is what happens in minutes, hours, days or sometimes months. Climate is what happens over long stretches of time like decades, centuries or millions of years.

I decided not to mat & layer my photograph this time, instead I simply glued it on of of the paper layers. Like a lot of designer scrapbook paper on the market, there was a very pretty & coordinating strip of pattern at the bottom of the sheet that we would trim off. I chose to use this on my page, it's the narrow strip of floral paper, which I tied a bow of 'bakers twine' too before gluing in place, this tiny strip of paper worked well on the page because it contained a hint of orange, which tied in nicely allowing me to use orange on the little 'American Crafts' embellishment.
A tax free weekend is a weekend designated by the state of Texas where sales tax is suspended on clothing, school supplies, and other back to school items. The goal of the tax free weekend is to encourage shopping and make items a bit more affordable for working class families getting ready for school. A lot of discounts and big sales take place during the tax free weekend as the stores attempt to clear out their summer stock to make room for the fall and winter stock. It's a great time to go shopping for deals. You get a lot more for your money's worth.

Aamir Khan started his career as child artist in his uncle Nasir Hussain’s film “Yaadon Ki Baraat” in 1973 but his professional career kick started with a Ketan Mehta’s film “Holi” in 1984. That film didn’t do well at the box office and he tasted first success with his cousin Mansoor Khan’s film ”Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak” in 1988 and thus became a chocolate boy of Bollywood. It was also through this film that he won his first Filmfare for Best Male Debut and since then he never looked back. After six previous nominations during the 1980s and 1990s, Khan received his first Filmfare Best Actor Award for his performance in Raja Hindustani in 1996, his biggest commercial success so far.

Part of what was revolutionary in Roebling’s design was the use of steel wire as opposed to iron. Steel had not yet proven itself as the reliable building material we know it to be. The tension of these steel cables, with the profusion of smaller suspender cables radiating off of them to connect with the bridge floor, not only creates one of the most beloved and notable aesthetic features of the bridge, but also much of its stability.
The two-year-old, who had strayed from her Warwickshire nursery and was spotted toddling along a village road by a bricklayer driving past, was later found, drowned, in a pond.

This will kill two birds with one stone, getting people to work for less pay and less benefits, and creating new profits for NACTs contract provider mates. Cuts in social welfare will mean workers facing poverty and misery and increased sickness as spending cuts in health services leading to early deaths and less of a drain on the bosses' profits. Health Boards are already closing important services like youth psychiatric care to balance their budgets, and those denied access to ACC couselling for sexual abuse are driven to suicide.

As I headed back toward La Paz, I stopped to get a photo of this neat cinderblock bridge over one of the pristine streams I passed as I traveled. One of the many cool things about being up this high is that there just aren’t that many people or animals above you to sully the waters before they make their way down to you. Yes, I did walk down to splash my face and drink from this icy cold stream. My assumption was that, with a good portion of the population of Totora Pampa involved in their community meeting, the parts per million of human excretions in the stream’s flow was likely pretty minimal at this moment.

Why is the left deviation from average a sickness, while the right deviation from average is a virtue? The deeply joyous are as equally deviates as the deeply sad. Yet only the sad have to be medicated into conformity. When the medical community starts saying that chronic perkiness is a mental illness I’ll take their claims that my style of light depression that harms no one but me is a mental illness a little more seriously. In the mean time, they’re just picking on sad people because we make them sad too.
There is more of course which shows that the book really isn't about a lady of class holding a party to help her husband socialise with those who can help him in his career. Each of these characters had their dreams and none of them realised them in a way. Or if they did it turned out not what they expected. Dalloway's daughter is the only one who still dreams of her future and this makes her the perfect contrast.

Anything capable of cognition (mental processes) is a conscious (capable of awareness, feeling, subjectivity) thing. It would appear then that consciousness is restricted to livening things. Is this, however, necessarily true? Can something like say, a tree, which is a living thing, perform mental processes? Trees are no doubt growing and living things – but it would certainly appear that they don’t perform any mental processes nor does it appear that they have a mind. One does not observe trees making conscious mental decisions to grow a certain height, or to grow a certain number of leaves .
