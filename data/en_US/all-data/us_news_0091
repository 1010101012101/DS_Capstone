“There’s no way to describe it,” Kiwanuka told The Star-Ledger after a MAB Celebrity Services appearance in Franklin Lakes. “I’ve been blessed by god to be able to continue to do this.

There are several theories as to why cats eat plants, but most veterinarians think plant eating provides fiber to cats.

Many owners grow "cat grass" for their indoor cats to fulfill their cat's desire to eat plants.

The categories were chosen and weighted in consultation with local education experts. This year's report relies on some 2009 data – the most recent available – especially in the college and career prep category.

According to our vet, the vaccine delays the effects of a bite, reduces the severity and helps the dog recover more quickly. Even with the vaccination, your dog, if bitten by a rattler, should be taken to your vet for evaluation and possibly more treatment.
Clickner says he has no objection to the idea of Bumper Bash. But he says it got more unruly after that judicial ruling last year, with ever more boats and people. "The only problem I have is it has gotten out of control — fights, people getting hurt," Clickner said.

Cavallo, Joe. Former attorney for Greg Haidl. Yelled at me as the TV cameras were rolling during a press conference for only referring to his client as "The Punk." I've since ceased and desisted. Cavallo briefly defended former Assistant Sheriff George Jaramillo on bribery charges while facing his own indictment for alleged conspiracy in a bail-bonds scheme. He pleaded guilty and in December of 2007 was sentenced to six months of jail - which he shrewdly arranged to serve at home without letting T-Rack's office get wise. I expect him to have his law license reactivated any day. Despite our earlier differences, Joe and I have reached an understanding. I believe there's a lot of good in this man.

Kim Jong Il was ruthless and megalomaniacal, using nuclear weapons for both blackmail and profit -- and he looked the very caricature of the authoritarian villain, with his pouffed hair, pudgy cheeks, platform shoes and too-tight jackets. But his focus was always on power. As a young man, Kim Jong Il had to fight to persuade "Great Leader" Kim Il Sung, his father and the founder of modern-day North Korea, to designate him as his successor; then when he took over after his father's death of a heart attack in 1994, he swiftly created his own cult of personality as the "Dear Leader."

Earlier in the season, Carrie Underwood sent gifts to Skylar and the other finalists. Skylar's was a Tiffany's necklace with a heart and an inscription that read "Love, CU" on the back. "I think I wore it once on the show, but I wear it more every day," she says. When the finalists met Carrie yesterday, "she just told us all to be ourselves. I would love to get to talk to her about her whole career, how she's done. I love her as an artist. She's very sweet. She's an inspiration, too." (After the show, Carrie tweeted her, saying, "You're amazing, girl! Now hurry up and get to Nashville!")

Lobbyists have long been known in California as the Third House, referring to their entrenched status alongside the Legislature's two official houses, the Assembly and Senate. But through interviews with current and former legislators and aides, as well as lobbyists and outside government experts, the Mercury News documented a changed pattern: Today, lobbyists function almost as a shadow legislature, pulling the strings at every turn for short-term lawmakers who have become accustomed to letting private interests monopolize the public debate. At the center of this reality is the sponsored bill.

Back to nonfiction, barely, the big tech news last week was the purchase of Instagram by Facebook for a cool $1 billion. Jon Stewart spoke for all geezers when he asked on "The Daily Show" whether that really meant "a billion dollars of money for a thing that kind of ruins your pictures?" It's difficult for some people to understand — a billion dollars for a photo-sharing app — but then, those poor old-timers who don't get it are probably the same people who cling to what Shteyngart's novel calls "printed, bound media artifacts."

If you’ve been following The X Factor, you know there’s already been quite a lot of drama with the judges. Originally, Nicole Scherzinger was slated to be the show’s co-host with Steve Jones, who happens to be British. Cheryl Cole, who also happens to be British, was originally the fourth judge. However, it was determined after the first two auditions that Cheryl’s accent was too hard to understand. Hmm. And Steve Jones accent isn’t? Am I bitter? It’s hard to say. I love Nicole. I love Cheryl. But I think Cheryl got the raw end of the deal. She is a malaria survivor, after all. But Cheryl went back home to The United Kingdom, where she’s a national sweetheart, so she‘ll be okay. Perhaps it was all just a publicity stunt to get people interested in the show. Either way, Cheryl was not treated the right way. Am I bitter about this? Maybe. It’s hard to say. I’ve only been holding a minor grudge about it for several months.

Best and most unexpected of all, "Rachel Getting Married" dares to mix the bitter with the sweet. It understands that life-altering situations like weddings not only bring out the worst in human behavior but also the finest. Because of Demme's long-standing interest in music (he's done documentaries with Neil Young, Talking Heads and others), all kinds of musical performances -- most memorably an a capella version of Young's "Unknown Legend" by the groom (Tunde Adebimpe of the group TV on the Radio) -- run through this film like a river, suffusing it with joy at the moments it needs it most.

Another shared complex in Surprise, Ariz., features a central stadium with the training fields sticking out like spokes on either side for the Texas Rangers and Kansas City Royals. The shape of the land purchased in Goodyear didn't allow for that configuration, so while the stadium includes perfectly acceptable locker rooms and an indoor batting cage behind the right field fence, players will dress at the complex and take shuttles to the park. That is, as soon as the shuttles are purchased. The complex includes three clubhouses - low minor league (metal locker, folding chair), high minor league (wooden locker, folding chairs with your number on it) and major league (wooden locker with the Indians' insignia on the knob, rolling chair). The football-shaped big league room includes no corners in which players can hide from Eric Wedge. And if you're an 18-year-old, 33rd-round draft pick and you're standing on blue carpet with red dots, you're in the wrong place -- red dots means a major-league area, all blue is for the minor leaguers.

Jeffery comes to town with immense NFL potential - he had 88 receptions for 1,517 yards and nine touchdowns as a sophomore in 2010, and his 3,042 career receiving yards are the second-most in SEC history.

Veteran Cunarders criticized the uneven service: missing cutlery, mixed-up orders, largely invisible wine stewards, the feeling of being rushed through meals. One night, I asked for a tall J&B Scotch and got a short Tanqueray gin. (Some of the multinational staff seemed less than fluent in English.) But I have only praise for Vivian, my cabin steward, who anticipated my needs and never made me feel as if I had to plan my day around her schedule.

The bursting in 2008 of a real estate bubble that powered the economy for more than a decade has saddled banks, particularly Spain’s savings banks or ’cajas’, with enormous amounts of bad loans. The country’s central bank, the Bank of Spain, says the sector is still burdened with about €175 billion ($230 billion) in "problematic" real estate holdings. There are concerns that, as Spain’s shrinking economy takes its toll on the banks, the government and possibly international lenders will be forced to step in and rescue the banks.

Worst trend: Shock, criticism or undue attention to performers who dress like … performers. A dress made out of meat is a big deal; a strapless dress or a mini-dress is not. Nor is a break from a tuxedo a reason alone for buzz. So long as artists have both the look and the sound — like Yuja Wang, Cameron Carpenter and many others performing today and long before — more power to them. If the visuals are too much for you, you can always close your eyes.
