I like to meditate. It makes me feel at ease and I am convinced that the sense of calm it produces helps me to handle thedaily challenges of my life. There are, of course, times when I don’t keep up my daily practice of sitting quietly for 10 or 15 minutes, but these are the times in my life when I experience more stress.

Paul writes that in Christ God’s promises are authoritative. “No matter how many promises God has made, they are ‘yes’ in Christ. And so through him the ‘Amen’ is spoken by us to the glory of God” (2 Cor. 1:20). When a congregation says “Amen” they are saying yes to God’s truth and thus glorifying God.

There are specific training programs designed especially for women targeting the ACL joint that help prevent these injuries from happening so frequently. It may be a wise choice on the parent’s part to enroll their daughters into one of these programs. Check out your local physical therapist and see if they have the knowledge and skills to work with your child in this type of training.

Oh, and he was an accomplished violinist, too:
January, January was hard, I received the news that my beloved Dad had passed away, he had been low level ill for much of my life, but it had accelerated in the last 5 years, when I saw him in November it was obvious that he was really very ill. I spoke to him at New Year and he sounded very positive and more like his old self and we were all looking forward to seeing him in April, sadly he died just a couple of days after our conversation, there are really no words to explain how lost I feel without him, it took a number of weeks of being in his house and sorting and decorating it ready for sale before I really took on board that he wasn’t going to walk in the door with a cheery ‘Hello my love’. Grief really is a bizarre thing, I spent a lot of my time in the UK just raging – at him for the state he’d left things in, at myself and the world, I mean I cried the night I heard and at the funeral, but other than that I was numb, on auto-pilot and angry. But, the tears have come, and they show no sign of stopping now.

Jesus + Nothing = Everything. Its a simple equation really. Similar to the mathematical equation 1 +1 = 2. But as simple as it looks and sounds it is so hard to live out. This is what Tullian Tchividjian discovered in his first year as senior pastor at Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Ft. Lauderdale, FL.

The Japanese concept of “ma”, a conscious feeling of space, plays an important role in this design ensuring freedom of movement and imparting a sense of calm and ambience in the room. The choice of an open-plan galley style kitchen ensures the space is not overloaded. Set-in kicks and an 80mm cantilevered feature stone island bench allow the cabinetry objects to “breath”; and rather than being regarded as ‘empty’ or ‘unused’ as it would perhaps in western design – the space that surrounds these objects creates a “push-pull” effect between empty and occupied and creates visual interest. Sensitive towards the need for non physical boundaries and with the desire to create a modern twist on the traditional tatami wall a small drop down ceiling incasing LED strip lighting subtly and seamlessly defines the space.
"Collecting evidence had gotten old a few hundred bullets back. I was already so far past the point-of-no-return I couldn't remember what it had looked like when I had passed it." And sometimes, gloriously, the writing goes on an extended trip around Planet Strange and explodes through cheese and corn into something that defies rational explanation:
I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a spoon and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis. Although you shouldn’t judge me until you have taken a few steps in my flip-flops.
Swinimer was suspended because he was "defiant of a reasonable request over principle. Eventually this lead to asking him not to come to school with that shirt," she said.
Why is this important? Because many hear a list of “do’s” and “don’ts” in his soundbites and statements. This is where we all should be listening to those who listen to us. Are they hearing gospel or moralism? Are we preaching the gospel of what Jesus did or what we need to do/not do?

Lending sovereign ears to the civil society and holding accounts of liability is the foremost task of a reasonable government – a democratic republic – but not at the cost of annihilating the power structure and aligning with a subsidiary whose knowledge of the inside-system is as good as the ones outside it. As Shashi Tharoor replied to one of his twitter followers on the Anna Hazare brouhaha – “then elect different ones (political representatives). But till you do, elected MPs represent the people. It’s undemocratic for the unelected to impose their views.”

So now we have the sex crazed girlfriend, the music that Tipper Gore was quivering in her boots over, a new found love of booze and weed, the last thing was to fail out of school and though i didn't actually fail out i gave it a good shot, the 1.7 gpa i had earned that first spring quarter was just what i needed to get my dad's attention, not that i didn't already have it, i had already come home one night so ripped off my ass from a baseball game that if it wasn't for my mom the old man would've crucified me, and yes it was a school night, i was so drunk i fell over in the kitchen and pretended it didn't happen, i also pretended i couldn't see the blazing glare of my father who just put this evil grin on his face and said "go to bed son, i'll see you in the morning", and see me he did, i awoke with a splitting hangover and my dad's face about an inch from mine, he had me by the shirt that i had slept in and spat out "you're going to fucking school... if i have to be late to work you're going to fucking school, wanna pull a stunt like that, think you're a grown man than you can act like one and get your ass out of bed" and with that he released me and walked out of my room, i immediately passed out until he walked by my door and shouted "GET UP", i sat up and held back vomit and my sister handed me some Tylenol and some Tums and disappeared before she was caught aiding and abetting, i stumbled out to the kitchen and attempted to eat a bowl of cereal while my mother stood around fretting and trying to be pissed at me, basically she knew that if the old man left i'd work her over into letting me stay home a bit longer and i can remember sitting at the table half out of it as my old man made his way to the garage, "God dammit you better not let him stay home, you hear me, drag his ass to school if you have to", it was the angriest i'd ever heard my father, to this day it might be the most pissed off he's ever been at me...

What I thought was the funniest of all the gift would have to be Dreamers, that being because I'm now still waiting for it after almost two weeks of hype. What happened was that Dreamer has been teasing me with this dam gift for a while now. He was always saying stuff like "You will never guess what this thing is" and "It's going to be the best gift ever". Personally, I usually don't like surprises and I constantly tried to keep guessing what the hell it could be. He then kept throwing me off by saying stuff like he "couldn't get the official one but he got something like it that's just as good" (which turned out to be a lie because the product turned out to be officially licensed). Then they didn't bill him for it until way later than he expected which in turn meant they shipped it later and I had to wait an extra week. I was getting anxious and he was getting pissed that it was taking longer then expected. He called me on Friday saying it was on his way to his house and that I should come over to open it. After playing a few more hours of Pokemon at his house it finally came, he threw me the package and said Happy Birthday as he tried to pull in a second much larger package that was for his mom.

When we understand the relationship between grace and mercy, we see the giving nature of God more clearly; we see the great lengths to which He has gone to make a way for us to be forgiven for our sins; we see the miraculous gift it is that He’s done even more in giving us His Holy Spirit to empower us to live above sin’s domination. And when we see all of that, we can revel in the grace of God that brings us the mercy of God.
What is different about this exercise in planting grass is that the workers are not using sod, carpets of grass that can be rolled out onto the dirt. Instead, as if they were on a rice paddy, the workers were hand-planting individual packets of the green stuff. Was this the most efficient way to do it? Probably not, but I’ve commented on this tendency before.

In law school, I spent much of my waking time in the library, studying. (And some of my sleeping time, too–I occasionally fell asleep on the floor in “the stacks,” the windowless basement rooms crammed with bound volumes of law reviews and obscure references.) The main reading room featured classic oak library tables, some tucked in book-lined alcoves with arched windows of leaded glass. In one alcove, a maple vine poked its way in through a pinhole in the glass and twined down the stone walls.
But the sheer irony here is that the elders and teachers, who taught us to be tolerant of others, could not control their own furies and feelings of vengeance. Time and again, they got provoked by various instances and butchered the men, women and children of their own country. And by doing this, they slaughtered the whole of humanity as well as the existence of the eternally kind Man, who subsisted in the books we read at school. The people who gave lectures on compassion and pity were the same ones who started abusing it vehemently in adverse situations. Of course I need not mention that exceptions will always be there. Without any doubt, I will certainly agree to the fact that there are people who followed what they taught. And it is to those people that I will look up to, for they deserve to be respected and honoured.

Over the years, over and over after each blowout I always reevaluate the friendship. I think about what we’ve been through and how we’ve been there for one another through really bad times, but it always seemed like we struggled with one another during the good.

Apparently I promised to announce my giveaway winner yesterday and totally failed to do so (whooooops!) I've really gotta work on not making anymore promises on this here blog-o' mine. I obviously got a little excited about posting pics of mine and Katie's "blacation".
A few years ago, a good friend of mine showed me something quite unique and special. It is called ‘My Week with Dan’ and I was instantly taken with it. For me, a lot of the stress about really intense emotional situations is the pressure I place on myself to remember every detail. Often it’s a catch 22 between not/and desperately wanting to forget something in my life. There are some things we share with people that are so special and unique and so hurtful it’s almost impossible to completely grasp the situation or make sense of it. Often, after time, we gain clarity but so often I have forgotten too much of the situation to learn or take away anything valuable.

Not every unmarried mother was coerced or forced into giving up her child, but the women going public today are not alone.
I had one friend tell me that after she gave birth her body felt like sh*t. We didn't go into specifics. I hadn't had any kids yet. But I can now say after having one of my own. It is indeed true.

From there, Nav and I walked over the SIFF Uptown theater in Queen Anne, where the night’s screenings would take place. At night’s end, I don’t think I’ve ever been as excited about filmmaking as I was at that moment. The caliber of films screened Friday night was mind blowing. Not only were some films as high quality as professional done indie films and Hollywood productions, but the story concepts were fun, original, and creative. I spent the night running between the two screening theater rooms trying to see as many of the night’s films as possible. The categories of the films I got to see that night were: Keep it Cinematic; Sex, Lies & Angst; Late Night Comedy; and Late Night Horror. There’s not enough time or space on here to really delve into what were my favorites from each category and why. But what I can go on about is how much tonight and all of NFFTY is one incredible learning experience. One, I’m getting to watch all these amazing films and hear about the processes the filmmakers went through to make them during the Q&A sessions; and two, watching these films, I am connecting and bringing together all of the things I have been learning over the past two quarters as a CineMedia major. My experiences in acting classes, screenwriting classes, directing seminars all come into play as I watch these showcases of youth talent. As I watch a film, I can’t help but automatically analyze it for what is working and what isn’t in it. I have Andrew Tsao’s voice in one ear speaking about dramatic narrative and acting, and in my other ear I have Shawn Wong’s voice speaking about element’s of screenwriting and dialogue. Watching these films was such a learning experience for me for when I want to go and make my own stuff. For example, within one film, I can be watching and think, wow this is an incredible scene, and know why it’s incredible, why it’s working and what the filmmaker was thinking when he/she was creating it, because of the tools I have gained from CineMedia. Similarly, within that same film, I will watch a scene and think, mmmm this scene isn’t working exactly right, something’s off, and I’ll know why it’s not working because of the skills I’ve gained from CineMedia. Each film had moments of pure awesome glory as well as moments that just missed the mark. And each one taught me something different or left me with a different take away that I could apply to my future film projects.

I enjoyed reading all these stories. They are piqued my interest, being a unique set of stories, and not the same as the others I’ve read recently. I usually have a favorite story in these types books, and I think my favorite in this collection is Promise of Yesterday because Marylu had unexpected Sass and Chester was as mischievous as they come. It made for a fun story. If you like Barbour’s collections, or just like historicals, you’ll want to read PROMISE BRIDES. $7.99. 383 pages.

Not all projects have to come from old or recycled materials. You can mold and form new materials into something completely different than it’s originally intended purpose. IKEAHackers.net is a great example of molding something from it’s original form into something completely new. It compiles user-submitted projects, originating from only IKEA furniture and then made into different items and uses. My personal favorite is an example where they purchased IKEA glass shelves and used them as a backsplash for a kitchen (Photo featured on the right). Taking something from it’s original intent and turning it into an entirely different concept is key when decorating on a budget. It will also save you a fortune!

The IPA follows the increasingly public and heated “patent wars” among tech industry competitors and a growing criticism of “patent trolling,” the practice of collecting patents just to force other companies to pay licensing fees. As I have reported on this blog, Google and Oracle are currently embroiled in a patent litigation trial over the Android operating system. Last month, Yahoo was accused of being a patent troll when it filed a lawsuit against Facebook alleging that the social media site infringed on its patents.
As I mentioned we also had a photographer in the shop taking our photographs for a feature in a national newspaper in a few weeks time. We were both a little nervous, but he was great. We did ask if he could get rid of our extra pounds, and I was particularly worried about my roots (Debby had had hers done the day before!). He was very patient, and put us as ease, but when we were being particularly trying he did say to us `I have photographed super-models you know` that soon put us in our place. That said he did say it with a grin!

The Time Lords accept that that their is evil in the universe that must be fought and that the Doctor still has a part to play in that battle and noting the Doctor's interest in the planet Earth decide to exile him there in the 20st century until they deem proper, and for that period the secret of the TARDIS will be taken from him. The final part of his sentence is that he must charge his appearance once more. They show him options for his new appearance. The Doctor protests and refuses the options as too old, too young, too fat, too thin. The Time Lords tell him the decision will be made for him, he is sent spinning away and we say a tearful farewell to the second Doctor and Patrick Troughton.

NT: The story which saddened me greatly was our Ricky Hatton splash when we caught him taking hard drugs. I was the man who got that famous picture of him snorting a line of cocaine in a bedroom using a hidden camera. I can see why that was a great tabloid story and a valid one at that. But nevertheless, Ricky Hatton is a great person and a wonderful sportsman and I was sad to see him on our front page like that. Since then, it looks as though he has cleaned up his life so I try to hold onto that positive.

Esteban also said, “I’ve celebrated many Liga titles as a fan, and now I have a lot of desire to celebrate one as a player. We’re now close to an important title that we could win. Being part of this team, which will enter into the history of the club, fills me with pride.” El Pirata added, “I’m proud to be with players like Cristiano, the kind of player that make a difference. It’s a joy that he plays in Madrid, that he’s a teammate and that he continues working each day with humility and effort.” Lovely statements, and the type that only a canterano can say. We need more canteranos like him on the team!!!!
The NFL’s historical insistence upon curbing the individual egos of its more outspoken, flamboyant, and thus popular personalities while also severely punishing those others who fail to comply with the constant changes in rules and policies that clearly seem to favor a less physical game contradicts its very purpose as a business entity- to entertain. Fans watch football for the natural excitement derived from its unique action and, more importantly, the successes and failures of its players who have come to transcend the character-driven society that watches them play. By dampening the sport’s physical intensity and stifling the natural creativity of its players by marginalizing the pedestal upon which fans place them, the NFL undermines its obligation to the fans that continue to treat it so well.
I hope to see you all again soon, and KEEP ON ROCKIN'!!!
According to reliable sources at the Natural Resources Defense Council, this DOE report is an accurate accounting of all the 239Pu produced for weapons production in the U.S. since 1944, and the data in this report is compatible with nuclear weapons production listed in the Nuclear Weapons Databook produced by the NRDC in 1984, and reviewed above in this section of RADNET. The NRDC report notes a 1983 nuclear weapons stockpile of 26,000 nuclear war heads; the rule of thumb of three kilograms of plutonium for a typical nuclear weapon would indicate that the DOD report does account for all special nuclear material (plutonium – excluding enriched uranium).

This general feeling can apply to anyone but it especially seems to present itself to mothers at home and homeschool moms and moms with kids with various learning problems or disabilities or challenges.

We’ve also heard a couple of people ask whether the nest box might fill with water. The answer is no – the tray has drainage holes under the gravel which allows the rainwater to drain into the gulley. When the falcons first chose the building as their home the nest area was often waterlogged, so we fitted a nest box that was slightly raised off the guttering floor to allow the water to pass underneath.

I am convinced that there are many Christians today who are bearing a load of guilt for having doubted the will of God in their lives. Perhaps one failed to heed God’s call to the mission field, or the pastorate. Perhaps he left the pastorate or gave up that Sunday school class. Maybe you promised to support that foreign missionary but thought you couldn’t afford it. All of this is answered in Colossians 1:18;

Ashleigh selected a traditional pearly pink wedding cake but unbeknownst to her, her Mother has ordered another cake with Ed Hardy-inspired black fondant that is decidedly un-girly from the same baker. Another one of Mom’s surprises is a custom-designed ice luge engraved with the couple’s monogram to serve their signature cocktails.

So Yes, the Rg, sAma, yajur and atharva vEdAs existed prior to vEda vyAsa, as a body of mantrAs, differing in chandas (metre), swarAs (notes – 3 in Rg and 7 in sAma) and with gadya or prose portions in the yajur vEda, but it was kRSNa dwaipAyana vEda vyAsa who organised them into manDalas etc as we find them today.
The large media companies have also diversified beyond the media field, and non-media companies have established a strong presence in the mass media. The most important cases of the latter are GE, owning RCA, which owns the NBC network, and Westinghouse, which owns major television-broadcasting stations, a cable network, and a radio station network. GE and Westinghouse are both huge, diversified multinational companies heavily involved in the controversial areas of weapons production and nuclear power. It may be recalled that from I965 to I967, an attempt by International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) to acquire ABC was frustrated following a huge outcry that focused on the dangers of allowing a great multinational corporation with extensive foreign investments and business activities to control a major media outlet. The fear was that ITT control “could compromise the independence of ABC’s news coverage of political events in countries where ITT has interests.” The soundness of the decision disallowing the acquisition seemed to have been vindicated by the later revelations of ITT’s political bribery and involvement in attempts to overthrow the government of Chile. RCA and Westinghouse, however, had been permitted to control media companies long before the ITT case, although some of the objections applicable to ITT would seem to apply to them as well. GE is a more powerful company than ITT, with an extensive international reach, deeply involved in the nuclear power business, and far more important than ITT in the arms industry. It is a highly centralized and quite secretive organization, but one with a vast stake in “political” decisions. GE has contributed to the funding of the American Enterprise Institute, a right-wing think tank that supports intellectuals who will get the business message across. With the acquisition of ABC, GE should be in a far better position to assure that sound views are given proper attention. The lack of outcry over its takeover of RCA and NBC resulted in part from the fact that RCA control over NBC had already breached the gate of separateness, but it also reflected the more pro-business and laissez-faire environment of the Reagan era.

The novel is an exploration of my own bisexuality, which, to be fair, is quite latent at this point, and has always been. It is not that I have problems with women. I’m really very fond of women, in fact, at one juncture in my life, I thought I may embrace a lesbian lifestyle wholeheartedly, if only to escape men, who I was beginning to see as uncouth, selfish and cold. Thankfully, Mein Herr disillusioned me of that misconception where men are concerned. But I have a soft spot for girls, which I could never entertain for men. In the warm, smoky shadow of a club, I will allow an unknown girl to take liberties with me that I would never allow a strange man to. I have said before that I have intimacy issues, and I do… But only with men. Usually.

I am self-published. I’m a bit of a control freak and I like having the total creative control over my work. No one is going to be as passionate about my books as I am. No one is going to care as deeply about how they are presented or marketed. No publisher is going to believe in them as much as I do. If my books are good, they’ll find an audience. If they’re not, they won’t. I’m not against traditional publishing. For me, it
Just to put the allergy thing in perspective, about a week-and-a-half ago, I had been using my inhaler at least 2 puffs every 4 hours. I woke up multiple times in the middle of the night choking due to post-nasal drip. Then my gag reflex would be activated, and I'm sure you can imagine what happened after that. It was to the point where I simply couldn't function.
As for me... well, I have been dealing with ongoing headaches ever since The Bug dropped two FULL Sigg bottles on my head one morning last week. I did see the doctor about it yesterday and she said I check out fine. While the area where the bottles hit my skull is still tender and a tiny bit swollen, the headaches get worse as the day wears on and often envelope the entire right side of my head as well as my neck, which is my old MO for stress headaches. I thought about it yesterday and realized that I do feel very stressed out all day every day lately due to the horrific state of our house. Clutter, clutter EVERYWHERE but it's all I can do to get the bare minimum done every night between the time when the girls go to bed and I do. Our biggest problem is paper clutter and I'm often tempted to just make a big ole bonfire out of all of it.

These reports led some to speculate that the intelligences behind UFOs have an interest in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. One feature of these reports suggesting a direct link deals with light rays or energy beams being focused on nuclear materials...In addition, there have been unsubstantiated rumors from enlisted men that the telemetry of the weapons at some sites had been changed or that other weapons had been rendered inoperative.
Do your research to determine which weapons best suit your needs. Once you’ve determined that, then check both the used and the new gun racks at reliable gun dealers. Shop carefully and ask questions when you need to. If a firearm is of good quality and has been reasonably maintained it should be able to last for generations.

Ex-President John Adams wrote to his successor, Thomas Jefferson: "I do not like the re-appearance of the Jesuits. If ever there was a body of men who merited eternal damnation on earth...it is this Society..." Jefferson replied: "Like you, I disapprove of the restoration of the Jesuits, for it means a step backwards from light into darkness." The Jesuits are still in trouble today as they have been throughout their existence. On February 28,1982, Pope Paul II told the Jesuits to "keep clear of politics and honor Roman Catholic tradition." U.S. News and World Report stated that the Jesuits had indeed meddled in the affairs of nations.

It is important to observe that what the above-quoted constitutional provision empowers Congress to delegate to the President, is not the power to promulgate rules and regulations of administrative nature, for this may also be delegated at any time without necessity of an express authority by the Constitution, but the power to promulgate rules and regulations purely legislative in nature, leaving to the discretion of the President the determination of what rules or regulations shall be or what acts are necessary to effectuate the so-called declared national policy, for otherwise it would not have been necessary for the Constitution to authorize Congress to make such delegation.

Once the hole had been properly dug out, it was in the nick of time that Helicopter Dan and his crew of Joslyn, Tam, their daughter Manthee and another hand named Adam all met at the big hole in the ground just after the sun rose on a cold morning in early November. Kurt and I were hoping to see Robert join our crew only to be disappointed to watch him drive past us raising two fingers off of his steering wheel with a weak wave as he made his way to work at his new job at Lowe’s. Giving up on the Sheriff’s Department was disappointing, but I wasn’t surprised to learn that he had passed on another career opportunity. Robert had been complaining for several weeks about working in the jail system in Bozeman and was not happy with the lack of progress he was making towards becoming an officer on the beat. Although his lifelong dream of working in law enforcement appeared to be over he was putting on a good face about returning to his fallback source of employment. So now once again Robert was back in the retail saddle where he seemed to be most comfortable. But now that we really needed Robert’s help he was knee deep himself, in training for his new assistant manager’s position for one of the biggest retailers in the nation. We would be hard pressed to see him anywhere near the building of our shop and the setting of our home or anything to do with the transformation of our land. We were on our own, and yet felt so safe here now with all of these strangers who were giving and friendly and hardworking and small town nice. The tension caused by Robert’s consistent lack of participation in the build of our home was deeply disturbing to Kurt and I and it was very embarrassing to me personally. As he drove past all of us gathered in the extreme cold temperatures that early November morning, Dan and Tam looked at me with a curiosity that only could be described as dismay, as we all wondered if and when Robert would ever lend a hand to his Aunt and Uncle whom he had urged to move here so that we could all be a family again.

We have always known that there were strange parallel events happening in our lives.

I stumbled across Will Thomas’ Some Danger Involved whilst searching for information on the lives of Jewish people in Victorian London – quite random I know but it turns out researching possible future novel projects is a lot more appealing than getting on with redrafting the current one.

What else could I give this book except five stars! It made me respect the genre of YA fiction. It caused me to completely revamp my rating system for books. It set a new standard of writing, one that demands real depth for a riveting plot, and a healthy respect for the intelligence of readers. But my main reason for the five-star rating is something I call the "OH MY GOD, NO WAY" factor. I can't count the number of times I had to stop reading, or exclaim, "OH MY GOD", because Catniss got out of one life-threatening situation only to be faced with another horrific dilemma. Every time you thought there was absolutely nothing worse that could possibly happen to her, Suzanne Collins threw out some unbelievable plot twist or wickedly creative evil. The drama began almost from page one, and it was going strong through the last sentence.

The Scripture says that three things agree on the identity of Christ: Spirit, Water, and the blood. These are seen in the three robes. The blood is shown in the ephod, which had red fabric. The blue robe, most clearly, symbolizes the water. The white robe represents the Spirit.

“It’s probably some hobo’s pet, maybe even his dinner. Forget about it Marl, lets go before it gets dark.” Roland started out of the clearing, silently praying that his friend would be quick to follow. “It’s not that unusual Marley.

I tried so hard to push my disappointment aside and just go on with making dinner, but this time, instead of simply feeling sad, I felt angry. That's a new emotion that I haven't felt before in this circumstance. I reminded myself of the last blog post I wrote. "Remember, it's all part of the journey..." and that helped a little, but my anger persisted.
The entire debate concerning the legalization of marijuana really ticks me off. It’s the one thing that riles me up and ruffles my feathers. Nothing aggravates me more. Proponents for its legalization say the movement symbolizes America’s hallmarks of “freedom,” “pursuits of happiness,” and ” live and let live.” And to be perfectly honest, that’s a bunch of you-know-what.

As for the equipment seen, its just an everyday, ordinary Manifest train, with modern high-horsepower General Electric motive power. Its nice to see some contemporary railroading for once, but then again, this is a reality TV show, so I doubt they would have had the budget to repaint all the equipment for just a c few minutes of air time. All that FOX did was blur out the Ferromex name. I don’t know why they do that, when the Paint Scheme of the locomotive will give it away to the Railfan and Railroad Employee. This is one of my favorite segments that have aired, and I keep have used this clip to show the dangers of illegal immigration, as train hopping is very dangerous and can easily kill.

Yes, I'm actually saying that being a scientist sucks and drains your youth away. I mean, look at this picture (and any other scientist pics, for that matter): have you ever seen a scientist that has any hair colour other than white? No! Because their youth is no more. You're probably asking yourself right now: "Can I pick my nose? Hope nobody's watching." and on a more related note "What the hell are you talking about?" and think of how nice it is to be a scientist: your have your own groupies, you're permanently respected by other scientists and must have heaps of cash as a result of your life-saving research. I mean...Albert Einstein was respected and he also was a ladies man. How could this go wrong?

Put some powdered sugar into a bowl. Melt the chocolate chips with the peanut butter in the microwave or a double boiler. Stir together to combine.

Surya dev (or Sun God) however assured Kunti that even after being blessed with a son, she would still remain a virgin and would not have to suffer any opprobrium. And so Karna was born with kavach and kundal (armor which would make him invincible). Kunti was nevertheless afraid of social stigma and therefore she abandoned the child. She put Karna in a basket and placed the same in the Ganges river, the basket was seen by Adhirath, a charioteer, who had no issues. He picked up the baby and brought him up. That is why Karna is also sometimes referred to as Sarathiputra. Thereby karna became the illegitimate eldest son of Kunti.

For the right, it proves the morbid perversity of Islam; for the left, it proves the repression of women. Both points might be well taken if anyone had the slightest evidence that any such law exists. No one has produced any.Yet by the time it gets to The Daily Mail, the story has become:

I had high hopes and an open mind entering this book. Unfortunately, it turned out to be disappointing. It actually began intriguing, and that was encouraging, but it quickly became confusing.

I wasn't sure if I was missing important information until I almost reached the halfway point of the book! That was bewildering.

Despite issues with waiting times and mediocre survival rates on some chronic diseases, Canada ranks high in such aggregate indicators as healthy life expectancy, potential years of life loss, and survival rates from stroke. The 2005 court decision notwithstanding, Canada's commitment to equality of access remains the signature statement of its health care system.

It's constant guilt. Guilt for those 5 years you waited. Guilt that you went to school first. Guilt that you were 27 when you decided now was the time. Oh, how naive you were, that you thought you could control this. That you had your life planned out. You're guilty for your age, for the time you have waited between IVF. If only you did this last year, you would have had a baby now. Your eggs would have been one year younger. One year more awesome. It's the fact that you even talk about eggs. That's weird.

JAPANESE RACISM
There is a universal we can accept: Substantial Universals like the basic human nature which is born into all humans - varying degrees of inherited qualities like instinct, intuition, insight, love, hate, jealousy, loyalty etc. A capacity for understanding the world around us and taking in new information. We are not born with wholly formed a priori knowledge but certain qualities that lead us in a direction as we learn. One will like making things, another drawing. We are born into a ready-formed natural world that contains our historical and cultural worlds and this develops us as our ancestors created it to our varying capacities. This human nature is constant otherwise the characters in The Bible and the Classics would be strange to us, but they are not. Their cultures are different but they are recognisably men and women like us. Our common human nature is fulfilled in communities and this is universal as it applies to all racial groups. It is that that causes racial conflict: each group has loyalties and pieties to their own and defines itself in opposition to the other group. This is because the structure of the human mind is similar, but the contents of the minds of these respective groups, those above mentioned qualities, are directed towards their own people.

DESIGNER
It was not what I wanted to do. That is I didn’t want to criticize somebody else and from within myself I was lookin’ for the power to restrain myself, but in my mind there wasn’t much difference between niggers and spicks, even though they was ladies, and so as it was becoming uncomfortable, I thought more than once about excusin’ myself since Lucky and me was best friends. It left more than a bad taste in my mouth. “’Tis a sin,” the reverend said. Almost might I say of myself, while keeping on the right side of the law, that I was tempted ‘cause she was an attractive Mexican lady, but I was becoming about fed up over havin’ to make excuses for Lucky when he decided to have (what he called) “some fun, ‘till it was gittin’ where I couldn’t tell the difference between a lie and the truth and was actually compromised once and gave into temptation once, and once was enough to teach me a lesson ‘cause I didn’t really want to be seen with a Mexican lady. The Holy Grail of adolescence and behind it all: nookie the imagined heaven. Flesh was flesh, but nope! Nope! Nope! Nope! Not with a Mexican lady! Wouldn’t it have been better to have saved yourself for a cheerleader or the Homecomin’ Queen? Holly sheet, Lucky! A Mexican!

On the other end of the spectrum, we can ask how many championships were won by programs that do not have even the hint of impropriety. Put another way, how many national championships in football and men’s basketball were won by programs with no major violations? As you might guess, the answer here is a bit less encouraging:

Upon her arrival she said, 'I was received by a person who was unable to read nor write, and who was unable to write down my report on the incident.' Then she wrote her own report and of included all the details, including the words which were used by these black men against her during the hour-long ordeal, such as 'You white bitch, we are going to rape you." Or: "You white bitch, we are going to shoot you." When her report was read by this 'black illiterate policeman , HE objected to HER using the words 'white bitch.' He said he 'could not accept the statement in that wording and she will have to change her statement'.

I will admit that I was a bit dubious about this recipe. I have made quite a few baguettes in my day, and have even posted a recipe. So how much better could Reinhart's recipe be? The answer: so much better! As with most of his recipes, a little extra time makes for an amazing loaf of bread. The key to this French bread is pate fermente, a dough made the day before and kept in the fridge until needed. This pre-ferment and the final dough is a mix of bread and all purpose flour which makes for a tender loaf with a crispy and crackly crust.

I am not sure what kept me going back to sushi, but there was this inexplicable pull towards it, even though it repulsed me. I think it was my third or forth try, years later in fact, that something just clicked. Suddenly, I loved it. I tasted all the flavours separately, but understood their perfect synergy. The delightful balance of textures made sense. I could finally appreciate the inherent beauty of their design and delicate aesthetic. It was the 'ah-ha' moment in that relationship for sure.

Well, to photograph it – of course.

But showing a hot new guy around Junction High, she’s about to discover a whole new type of change. Pietr Rusakova is more than good looks and a fascinating accent—he’s a guy with a dangerous secret. And his very existence is sure to bring big trouble to Jessie’s small town. It seems change is the one thing Jessie can’t avoid…

“Physical attacks and the relentless intimidation of journalists are threatening freedom of expression in Sri Lanka. The disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda on 24 January, 2010 is but one example”.
The point is, I’m head-over-heels in love with my son and I wish I had more words to express that with. All everyone talks about before you have a baby is the complete lack of sleep you’ll get. First of all, that’s not the case for us at all ’cause we have the best son ever. But the other thing is, when I have to wake him up to eat at 4am (yes, I have to wake him up to eat) I love it. Yes, I would like to be sleeping but instead I get to pick up the cutest baby in the world and cuddle with him while he fills up his little belly. I get to hug him and kiss him and rock him to sleep and tell him I love him and there are no other distractions. My computer is shut down, the TV is off, my phone isn’t ringing. It’s just the 2 of us hanging out for 15 minutes before we both go back to bed and get ready for another day. But what’s the word that accurately describes that??

Hmmm. Sounds like a warning to me. And how did the militias, once alerted by Revere, warn the countryside and call their members to arms? Why, by ringing church bells, beating drums, and firing shots in the air of course. How else would it be done in 1775? Twittering a flash mob? Phone tree?

If you'll remember my post from Thursday of last week, you'll know how strenuously I have been trying to organize myself. I have my entire day lined out in writing, from waking up at 6:00 in the morning to start a load of laundry, to ending my day between 10:00 and 11:00 PM writing, reading or editing photos. Most of my day is filled with work, but during the down times while the kids are napping or after they go to bed, I get a little R and R, again, reading, writing, or editing photos.

Officially, the Slave Trade was abolished in the early nineteenth century. In reality it was universalised with the Jewish rulers becoming owners of the Goyim through the taxation system, and the twin evils of Finance-Capitalism and State-Socialism. Now more than ever, all non-Jews are in the pockets of the Zionist elite. Europeans have always been, and remain, victims of Jewish materialism.

Looking forward, let's assume for the sake of argument that the Court of Criminal Appeals concludes later this year that Pikett's methods don't pass muster. Nobody knows how they will decide, of course, and the CCA's track record leans toward admitting such evidence. But my sense is the Court took the case to overturn precedents allowing Pikett's testimony, based in part on apparently perjured testimony about his credentials, especially since he's the only person in the state who performed this procedure.

Also, buds that are in a "marshmallow" state often are attractive to all varieties of outdoor creatures because of the sweet sap, so there's a clue as to what to cut. Since the bud is still closed the theory is no pests are inside; the cold water dunk, soak & swirl is to remove any pest on the exterior as well as any sap that might still attract pests into your home.

Every state that boarders (sic) New Mexico except for Oklahoma which only has the Tip of its Panhandle touching New Mexico are now not welcome in New Mexico if they carry a firearm. All those citizens were welcome in the not to distant past. Also Colorado and most likely Texas will drop New Mexico and then citizens of New Mexico will not be welcome in those states if they want to carry their defensive firearm. That will cause a lot of calls, emails and letters to start flowing to politicians and an election is coming up. Those Politicians don’t want any waves right now that they don’t need. So it will be very interesting to see what happens in the coming weeks. I am hoping for the best. I also what to say I don’t know anymore about the Why’s of this any more than you do.

“Just because I said, ‘I’m a fish’ does that make me a fish?” I asked. They all shook their heads no. “So,” I continued, “the same applies to you cleaning your rooms. Just because you say ‘I will’ or ‘okay’ doesn’t mean you’ll do it”. At this point they looked intrigued. “So don’t tell me anymore that you will or agree with me the fact you need to do it. Simply clean your room, SHOW me you’re serious”.
The story unfolds as Lanore McIlvrae nurses a deep, unwavering love for her childhood friend, Jonathan St. Andrew. But any relationship between them is doomed due to social status discrepancies. Lanny is the daughter of a poor man next to the wealth and prestige of Jonathan’s family. Through a series of painful sub-plots, Lanore is forced to watch the man she has sworn herself to (and sworn belongs to her, claiming she will marry him) screw his way through the entire town of women. When he eventually allows her close to him and the metaphysical climax between the two is reached, Lanore falls pregnant; an unfortunate young girl with no luck on her side. Naturally, Jonathan, being a selfish sort of character despite his bright personality – like sunshine on one’s skin – informs Lanny that he will not marry her. He cannot marry her. She is beneath his station. His father would never allow it. He has already been promised to another. It seems there is no end to the excuses that roll out of this boy’s mouth.
MBR: I majored in English in college, and began teaching right afterward. I taught middle and high school, well before the big YA craze. There were very few truly engaging books for these readers, so I began to write one, but my love of mysteries, the Hispanic culture (influenced by my Mexican husband), and my desire to include swearing and sex in my books led me to the Lola Cruz series!

To make matters worse, the situation of disadvantaged, ethnic minority communities has deteriorated in recent months, due to the effects of reforms enacted by the Coalition Government. These threaten to exclude minority communities not only from membership of political and administrative institutions, but from having a say over their own communities. The Coalition’s sustained attack on the planning system has put the future of communities in the hands of local people with the potential for limited planning powers to be given to local areas. While this sounds democratic, in practice it will work to the advantage of wealthier communities who are capable of developing their own neighbourhood plans and accustomed to representing themselves in the public sphere. Poorer communities, and particularly those with a large proportion of people from ethnic minorities, will struggle as professional technical expertise and funding has to be provided from the community.

Kyle lauds McGarity’s business prudence, but I find it short-sighted. The SEC has a brand that’s incredibly strong. That’s already being diluted with the admission of two new members (something that time should fix, of course). It shouldn’t be put further at risk by limiting the conference match ups that most fans crave. Kyle’s bug here – playing West foes like LSU and Alabama – is most certainly my feature. And the concern about money that would have to be paid out to cancel contracts with West Cupcake A&M is overblown. A ninth conference game is valuable product that the SEC could offer to its broadcast partners and the increase in broadcast revenue should offset the penalty clause payments McGarity is reluctant to tender.
Thanks for reading…till next time.

We can all recall a time when we asked someone for something, maybe help with a project or a ride when our car is in the shop. And we got a 'yes' answer, but knew the other person really did not want to do it. You may have even added, “only if you have the time,” or “I can find someone else.” And you were brushed off with a “oh, it's okay” sort of statement even though it obviously really wasn't. The other person begrudged it, and you felt that 'put upon' feeling the whole time.
She has done what Badman did, and what the former Secretary of State did under the previous Government, which is to conflate child abuse with home education. Education and welfare are two separate things. Contrary to what Graham Badman stated in his report, and failed to substantiate in the Select Committee, there is no evidence that home-educated children are more subject to abuse than children in general. When there is a risk, local authorities have all due powers to intervene, and so they should. When such evidence arises, the authorities can and should go in to ensure the protection of the child. However, we cannot have the suggestion that home-educating families are linked to a problem of abuse. Nothing could be further from the truth, and it is important to nail that fact. We must not do as the previous Home Secretary did, which was to smear the reputation of home-educating families by suggesting that there is a problem, because there is no evidence for that.

Currently, Washington is the only African American lead on a network television show. While other shows like “Grey’s Anatomy” feature African American actors as main characters or part of an ensemble cast, they are never presented as the focus of the show. With the emergence of “Scandal,” the portrayal of African Americans in media is definitely changing.

4. How did God make mankind in his image? Does God have physical form? Or did he mean make them similar in temperament or personality? Furthermore, God created them male and female, so why do we use only male pronouns and masculine words for God?

I know you don’t want to here this, but someone needs to address the issue—even incredibly well received games have badly implemented platforming. Don’t believe me? Take a look at Uncharted 2. Considered to be a crowning achievement the year it came out it features platforming that is quite frankly, poor at best. One button does all of the work for you. There are very few obstacles that enforce player skill, such as collapsing platforms, or the need to scale something within a time limit. Hell, there’s not even any skill needed in either determining where to proceed next. There is very little timing required in your leaps, and more often than not you’d have to truly force Nate to jump in a direction he’s not supposed to. Some people call this streamlined design—I call it pandering and pointless.

7.) "I will find you," he whipsered in my ear. "I promise. If I must endure two hundred years of purgatory, two hundred years without you-then it is my punishment, which I have earned for my crimes. For I have lied, and killed, and stolen; betrayed and broken trust. But there is the one thing that shall lie in the balance. When I shall stand before God, I shall have one thing to say, to weigh against the rest." His voice dropped, nearly to a whisper, and his arms tightened around me.

I found that this wasn't this most trim diaper (fitteds and covers usually aren't), but it wasn't extrmemly fluffy. It as a good middle of the road "my baby is definately wearing cloth" fluffiness.
I know that exercise is doing awesome things for me: I've been told I "look smaller" than what I weigh. (Yay!) I have a LOT of weight to release, and exercise keeps that skin toned and tight because I don't want to look like a melted snowman naked. It keeps my lymph a-movin' and the colon moving too. It helps me deal with stress. It's good for my heart and lungs and coordination. And oh yeah: IT'S FUN. (That one still shocks me.)

This recipe really hit the spot the other night. I had a mismatch of leftovers in the fridge and none of them would create an entire meal for a family of three. I remembered seeing a similar recipe on Pinterest (see my food board here) and took it upon myself to create my own version. The only food I used for this recipe that wasn't considered a "leftover" was the pasta. Great way to Spring-clean the fridge!!

We started talking in the last post about Ezekiel and the encounters he had with God. We talked about how God called him to do some pretty crazy things – read Ezekiel 1-4 if you want to get a picture of his calling and just a small taste of the crazy things he was called to do. He was called to do these crazy things by God when he realized his dream of going home (he was in exile) was not going to happen. God gave Ezekiel a fresh dream and a fresh vision of what he was to do.

There was some stiff competition in this category with both Arturo Vidal and Mauricio Isla putting forward a good case but in the end it was hard to look past el nino maravilla, Alexis Sánchez. Coming of a stellar season with Udinese where he helped them qualify for the Champions League, Sánchez then got his dream move to Barcelona in July following an indifferent Copa America where he scored one goal in Chile’s four matches. Whilst an early season thigh injury curtailed his chances early in the season, Sánchez has managed five goals in eight games for his new club including a goal in el clásico.

First of all, and foremost on my mind tonight, is that Aunt Flo has finally decided to grace me with her presence. Now, in the past I have really complained, with reason too, about my monthly period. Not this time. This is the first period I will have started since my miscarriage. My body is finally getting back on track so for now I am appreciative of the back pain, bloating, and cramps. This is hope. This is what I cling to.
I recognize that it's really more about me than him. Max is probably my last baby. Carrying another child, both inside me and out in the real world, would likely destroy what's left of my back. That's the prevailing reason not to have another child, but I'm having a hard time coming to grips with the fact that the decision isn't really my own. I love Hannah and Max so much, and I know I have more love to give (the financial resources are another matter, but one that I'm sure we'd find a way to overcome). I'm only 33, and I just don't feel done. But I can't avoid the fact that not having another child is what is best for the children I already have, as well as for my marriage, since I'm not sure Marc wants to handle another episode of me being incapacitated with back pain to such a degree.

Obama also shows his weakness by only killing suspected terrorists and not going after their whole families. “CIA and military strikes this fall killed three U.S. citizens, two of whom were suspected al-Qaida operatives.” While we salute the killing without due process, especially of suspects who are U.S. citizens, once again we see how Obama is weak. A true boss of a crime sydicate would have not only killed the suspected snitches, he would have killed his whole family, down to third cousins. But Obama is too weak to follow through.
One issue with allowing the wing to ride closer to the ground through rake or flexing, is that at high speed or under braking (when the nose of the car dives), the front wing can be touching the ground. This is bad for both aero and for creating sparks, which will alert the authorities that the wing is not its normal position relative to the chassis. So teams are creating ways to manage front ride height. Traditionally front bump rubbers or heave springs will prevent excessively low ride heights. Also the front suspension geometry runs a degree of geometric anti-dive, to prevent the nose diving under braking.

Ayamontinomaria - 'MI PEQUENA LIBERTAD'
The book was cobbled together from a series of five sermons Carson preached at the 2008 Resurgence Conference at Mars Hill Church in Seattle, Washington. I’m willing to bet that these five sermons were actually written down in other books that Carson has written at some point in the past (many of his illustrations have been used elsewhere). If anything positive can be said about the book it is that Carson is at least consistent: He hasn’t said anything new since I started reading his work twenty years ago. That is what makes the work a rather tedious and hum-drum affair for me.

11. & now we wait. Okay, maybe this is the hardest part. Waiting to hear if people have received them (which surprisingly was wicked fast!). Waiting to receive the RSVP post card in the mail. We seriously considered offering a prize to the first person to send the RSVP card back, partly because we’re impatient & also partly as an incentive because we’ve heard that many guests do not return the RSVP card, despite the pre-paid postage & fill-in-the-blanks. We also added a couple of lines on the RSVP for people to request their favorite songs in hopes that would encourage them to send it back. An idea courtesy of my little sister, Rach. It’s fun to see what people request & also to know that people will be hitting the dance floor knowing that their favorite songs are coming.
I found this Nativity Set at a little stationery store in Manhattan Beach called Christie several years ago. I love the white, worn wood look and the simplicity of just having the three angels, two lambs and Baby Jesus. I have seen many others but this one remains my favorite.

Whereas, for example, specifying all the names for every Sergeant and officer in a Space Marine Chapter (or company) is really very stupid, because you are telling people that there’s a definite version of the truth.

It’s a book about love. Not just personal love but the energy of Love and about how it needs to be allowed to flow through the world once more. About an underground tribe of people who are spreading ideas of freedom, of change, encouraging the circulation of love. Not soppy love but pure, hard as diamond, true Love. The love that comes out of war, out of looking death in the eye. And, he says…’If just one person changes, the whole world changes.’ And it can. Think about the good old ‘butterfly effect’ – tiny tiny shifts can affect startling change.
I will be honest and real. I work a ton with Kristen. There is not one day that goes by that I am not correcting, prompting, working on my "never ending" list. Am I worn out at the end of most every day? Yes, but when I hear that precious girl talk it is worth every minute spent. I do it for her. To give her the gift of speech I feel is worth every minute of my time. Then, there are moments like this, that make me laugh and show me just how hard she works and gets it too. We were in speech this past week, and she put together this fabulous sentence. The speech therapist looked at her, and at that point, Kristen said, "See I made a complete sentence." I am always telling her to make a complete sentence. She wanted that speech therapist to know she did. The speech therapist looked at me and laughed too because it was really precious.

MoMA Executive Glenn Lowry misled the Grosz heirs by claiming that he had no authority to refuse their claims to the three artworks in question and had not refused their claims to the artworks. MoMA, represented by the Proskauer law firm, then changed its position, claiming that Lowry actually did have the authority to refuse the claims and that he'd actually refused the claims much earlier than he had by simply not returning the artworks.

The things I have written this evening have been recounted to me through countless tears from mommas and daddys who are hurting for the children they love, many who feel helpless and overwhelmed. One precious parent felt compelled enough to call and ask my husband if he knew "who he was dealing with" and "what we would be facing" by coming out with our story, this parent actually concerned for our well being. (I guess if our reputation is ruined after I blog about all of this, or if our family suddenly drops off the planet, then we'll all have tangible proof the school is indeed successful with the retribution tactics we continue to be warned about). I ask you parents, though, what would you do if you knew your child's school records and reputation had been seriously tainted for something your child had never done?....what would you do if your child was convicted for a charge he/she was completely innocent of?....would you defend your child with zeal or would you sit back and demand your child accept the unfair sentence and move on? I cannot encourage Caleb to sit back and not fight. His honor and reputation are valuable, so we encourage him to stand strong.

Easy, easy, no pushing or straining, no trying and no effort she followed her exhalation, her natural instinct to trust and let go. The contractions dropped their hard edge and found their density, steady with life coming closer behind each one. Twenty minutes passed in this space before that unmistakable ‘ha ha ha’ pant of a woman birthing the widest circumference of her child’s head thru the gateway of the perineum. The next contraction brought birth. Gentle, peaceful, beautiful, turning pink with life in her mothers arms, as relieved and surprised with the speed of her own arrival as we were.
Oh yeah, you know those vintage shirts from the 60's / 70's, maybe 80's. It's hard to overlook them when you poke around in thrift stores, they're so unique, beautiful in their own ways, and have this mysterious, nostalgic value. When I see one of them, I always held out my trembling hand, with a heart filled of hope, and POOF! 100% polyester - the spell is gone. Why are they always made of that horrible fabric? I don't know, but when I saw this shirt with its amazing colors and a contrast collar, and with a trembling heart I checked the description - it's cotton - I knew it had to be in my closet ♥

The last two years in the military have taught me a few things. 1) Cuss words are just sentence enhancers… they aren’t necessary, but they do emphasize the emotions in which you wish to convey. 2) You won’t always like your bosses and sometimes quitting isn’t an option. And 3) I really dislike military dependents. If you don’t know what a dependent is, its basically a human leech that affixes itself to a military member and then projects an almost admirable sense of self entitlement.

I read an article by Craig Newman on Crowdfunding this week. Before I read this article, I was not really familiar with the term “crowdfunding.” I assumed it was referring to fundraising efforts such as Kickstarter. However, Kickstarter doesn’t really bring in serious investors since your return is just the incentives given with specific dollar amounts. This speaks more to investment opportunities in which you get an actual financial return. Bills are apparently making their way through the House of Representatives and the Senate that will allow investors to buy small businesses’ stock online. The article speaks to the great opportunities that come from this, but also cautions readers that it could be used to defraud investors.

How often do we do a course, get the certificate, frame it and hang it on a wall in a remote spot where nobody sees it, or put it away in a drawer somewhere never to be seen again? How often do we do learning that we really want to do to help us build a future career? How many times have we gone on a course only to get out of the office, have time off or because the boss says so? How many time have we looked back and regretted not setting goals and planning our learning so that we can achieve our maximum? I have no doubt that you would tick at least one of the above questions, if not more.
a-, in the case of atheist and agnostic, is simply a privative prefix meaning “not” or “without.” So when a theist is someone with a belief in god(s), an atheist is someone without belief in god(s). The definition of gnostic is a little hard to pin down, but in this particular context it means someone who knows, or believes they can know, whether or not god exists. Similarly, agnostic is then someone who does not know, or does not believe they can know, whether god exists.

Jesus says that his shed blood is the New Covenant. According to Paul in 2 Corinthians, implied strongly in Romans, and Galatians, not to mention the mysterious Epistle to the Hebrews, the Old Covenant was good but incomplete. Christ’s death initiated a better, more perfect way, through the blood of Christ, the forgiveness of sins, and new life in the Spirit, apart from the sinful flesh. It didn’t replace the Old Covenant. It completed it. Christ satisfied the demands of the Old Covenant, and died the death that the Old Covenant required for our sins, and the people who live and depend on Christ’s blood are freed from the death wrought by the Old Covenant and exist to glorify God by living a new, redemptive, blameless life and by proclaiming the good news of redemption in Christ’s blood to the nations. This people who have “covenanted”with God through Christ’s blood by faith in Christ, against faith in themselves, or the world, are now the chosen people of God for His glory and for the nations. That group is recognized by a common symbol; baptism, and identified by a tragically loaded term (thanks to history and the sin nature); Church.

The other beer is another one from Germany, another one that is kind of tart, but has one key ingredient you won't find in any other beers. It's the Leipziger Gose (gose, not gueuze. BIG difference). The special ingredient that makes this beer different? Salt. Yep, salt. Not enough to make it salty, but enough to maybe kinda tell it's there when you drink it. It's actually not too far off from the 1809, in that it has some tartness there, and is quite refreshing, in spite of what you might think with the salt. It clocks in at a little under 5% ABV, and makes for another good warm-weather beer.

We didn't want everything to be to matchy, so we incorporated 4 different styles and colors of linens with different centerpieces to keep things interesting. Some tables had large flower arrangements, some with crystal trees, and others with a really cool candle display. I loved that everything blended, but still stayed interesting.

My enlarged image provides a perfect example of the advantages of the lack of quality and definition you got with cheap cameras eighty years ago. You are left with nothing but light and dark to stimulate your imagination : what is he reading, where is she going, will they meet, will they love?
They rejoice in what Allah has bestowed upon them of His Bounty, rejoicing for the sake of those who have not yet joined them, but are left behind(not yet martyred) that on them no fear shall come, nor shall they grieve.

The same divinity pervades Anna Hazaareji and the Corrupt people he wants to fight. Sometimes it looks like he is winning and sometimes it looks like his opponents are winning. The Self of the swAmijI who died of fasting for a pure ganga is the same as the Self of the people who are polluting it with chemical effluents from the factories.

What’s impressed us most about Lieu’s degustation menu is that the entire procession of courses is so clearly designed to please by way of celebrating the ingredients. Upper echelon cuisine sometimes gets a bad rap – and sometimes deservedly so – for being little more than self-congratulatory show-off techniques. This can come at the expense of giving eaters, to put it simply, a delicious dining experience.
This isn't really new to me recently... but I love this thing almost as much as the apple crisp I make with it. Totally worth it.
There are SO many types of bees, this just shows a few. Many people are allergic, if you don’t know if you are or not please be tested, it’s Very scary if your highly allergic and it could take your life. I was allergic when I was a child but not severely, I did not have to carry a bee kit. However I grew out of it & I am not now. That doesn’t mean I don’t stay away from them because I do, it still hurts when they sting you. These pests are EVERYWHERE in the spring & summer. Especially near blooming flowers, I have several fruit trees and lots of flowers and a huge garden that all need pollinated to produce fruit, flowers or vegetables so bees are here & I have to be mindful when outdoors exercising. Find more information about bee stings here. Here’s a picture I took in the yard of a swarm of hornets a few years ago. So glad I didn’t step right on this while I was walking – that might have ended in hospitalization, Hornets pack a powerful punch when they sting.
I didn't get Kölsch until I went to Cologne. From the bottle and keg it had always just tasted like a dry pilsner to me, and a very plain one at that. What's the fuss about? That changed when I got to drink it closer to the source. The smoothness offered by the version served from wooden barrels in the better Cologne pubs adds a vital dimension to the Kölsch experience you just don't get any other way. So I was intrigued and more than a little suspicious when I got hold of Thornbridge's bottled take on the style. Would bottle-conditioning make that all-important difference?

The last time I saw her was shortly after my birthday, years ago. Things had gone down between the jewel-eyed girl and I that involved shards of broken glass, and sobriety was something of a novelty to me. We hung out and gave our respective hugs goodnight. Our acquaintance faded into the odd correspondence, disappearing into that nameless void where friendships go when they die.

only good that came out of last night was my resolve not to repeat it.
I Love Franklin Ave will be on vacation from Friday 8/14 through Sunday 8/23, but the fun in the neighborhood never stops, so keep your eyes on Nostrand Park for all the latest. I heard through the Crown Heights CSA grapevine that one of their star bloggers will be staffing a table at a health fair of sorts on Park between Nostrand and New York this Saturday, so stop by (after you hit up the Franklin Flea, of course) to learn about the CSA's growing membership and how to get involved this year and next, as well as to chat all things Crown Heights with one of the neighborhood's most diligent and creative bloggers.

In addition to being a beautiful seaside resort on the northern coast of the Mediterranean, home of some excellent restaurants and amazing cappuccinos to which I can now personally attest, San Remo is the site where ninety-two years ago — on April 25, 1920 — the leaders of the Principal Allied Powers who had just been victorious in World War I met for a critically important international conference. There, they divided the Ottoman Empire into several zones of control. The French would control what would later become the countries of Lebanon and Syria. The British would control what would later become the countries known as Israel, Jordan, and the nations of the Arabian peninsula. Indeed, it was at the San Remo Conference where Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan signed a formal treaty pledging to reestablish a Jewish state in the British Mandated territory then known as “Palestine.” The San Remo Conference thus provided the official basis in international law for the re-creation of the State of Israel in the 20th century that had been foretold by the Hebrew prophet Ezekiel in Ezekiel 36-37 more than 2,500 years earlier.
There is so much more on offer at Imhoff Farm - horse riding, a snake park (not my cup of tea), face painting for the kiddies and a cheesery - enough to keep any couple, group of friends or family entertained for hours. It's not often that you find a place that appeals to small groups and big families at the same time. On our way out, I couldn't resist going over to stroke the camels - these regal beasts lie so quietly in their sand pit, watching the people from afar. Although they're not good with strangers, their trainer advised, one of them doesn't mind a good stroke - Isak, a handsome male, accepted my ear scratch and head stroke with pleasure. I'll definitely be back for a camel ride (only R50 to do a loop of the farm's front yard) in the near future. If you're looking for a fun weekend outing, away from the craziness and expense of Cape Town's hotspots, I really do recommend a visit to Imhoff Farm.

If you've been reading my blog recently, then you know that my goal is to run this half marathon in under 2 hours. To do that, however, I need to run it almost 9 minutes faster than I ran before. I've been training to run faster by doing shorter, faster runs, and I've recently started doing some interval sprint workouts. Still, I'm not entirely sure if I'll be fast enough, and up until Wednesday the last time I'd run farther than 7 miles was in October.

I left him alone and sat outside his room waiting for him to come to the door. I looked in after a half an hour and he was sound asleep. I gave him some kisses and covered him up. To be honest I sort of wanted to wake him so he could see me smile. I wanted him to really know I still love him even when he acts like an asshole. I truly believe these outburst are not directed at me. I’m just here and who else can he scream at. I’d scream too. He’s moved to us without warning, his visits with BM are cut in half without warning and no explanation. I know it’s for the best and I want them stopped frankly but that doesn’t mean it is easy for him. Part of my job is to clean up the mess the rest of these people made and get him on the right track. If I got take some abuse then so be it.
The other issue especially articulated by Carlos Alberto Pereira was that of the reserve league. As noble as the suggestions are, they meet the standards of the association and the league, but club owners have a different agenda. If the locals do not give them the mileage they need to be on top, requesting for extra expenses running a reserve team is not business at all. Here, the game dies.
The doctor came to check me and the baby. All was good but I was not yet due. He asked me to go for a walk. By the end of the day, I started to feel something that I can hardly call pain! But it increased by midnight. That sort of pain continued taking place and it increased again by noon the following day. It continued to increase to the extent that when it was present, I could hardly move my body. The nurse came in to help me with some clearing procedures before moving to help my baby be born. I felt excited! I can handle this pain! It seems that the experience is not that tough!!!
The headlines in today’s newspaper read, “Survivor describes horror attack after mountain run” and refers to an incident that took place last week when a young mother of two was brutally attacked and nearly raped whilst training for a marathon. There was also an article which warned home-owners to be especially vigilant in their driveways since these have become the most common places for attacks to take place - exactly as happened to my mom.

My other problem with this flick was that as interesting as the stories are, I could still never get into the characters that inhibited them which is where I think Soderbergh lost me with this flick. Yes, I understand this film is supposed to be a gritty, dark, and depressing take on the world of drugs that we live in, but after awhile, I just wanted to be able to root someone on let alone feel something for one person, even if it was only for a small second. Every character seems almost in one way or another, corrupt or totally idiotic and it’s a little frustrating when one character can’t seem to see the full picture, when it’s pretty damn clear in the first place. I don’t want to try and give away too much here but there was also a lot of plot twists that started going down at the end as well, that may have been a little too far-fetched but only because the plot is the one thing we were mostly paying attention to rather than the characters themselves.

The Red-winged Blackbird is omnivorous, the main part of its diet consisting of plant materials, including seeds from weeds and waste grain such as corn and rice, and fruit (blueberries, blackberries) in season, but about a quarter of its diet consists of insects and other small animals, and this amount increases during the breeding season. The Red-wing forages for its preferred food of flies, moths, butterflies and dragon and damsel flies by picking them from plants or catching them in the air; but they will also eat snails, frogs, carrion, worms and spiders. They seem to happily accept seeds, bread or suet as well.
The story takes place in 1971. The Weismann Theater, home to The Weismann Follies since 1918, is about to be torn down. Dmitri Weismann, the impresario who produced the shows, is giving a party on the stage of the theater and has invited all the living performers, along with their husbands and wives, to celebrate the nostalgia of the occasion. During the course of the party, we meet them all, but the action chiefly involves two chorus girls from the 1941 Follies, Sally Durant and Phyllis Rogers, who were best friends then and haven't seen each other since. They are escorted by their husbands, Buddy Plummer and Benjamin Stone, who courted them when they were in the show.

The official date was July 24, 2011. It was a wonderful day at First Baptist Church, Shreveport, Louisiana, as the church honored us with both a retirement and birthday luncheon, along with a proclamation of Minister of Christian Formation and Administration Emeritus . And so ended 42 years of full-time ministry, serving from Georgia to Texas. Friends from several of our former churches, along with family, were present. What great fun and memories.

The persecution of Christianity and other religions and the murderous bullying of critics in the West is all part of an attempt by extremists to subjugate and dominate, and to replace western cultures and values with their own. Our mainstream media has reacted by adopting the ludicrous hyper-sensitivities of the absolutists while turning a blind eye to their vicious intolerance.

Honestly, I think that fresh bread, such as a french baguette, is the ultimate cheese carrier with crackers being a close second. Some crackers are better to pair with cheese than others. If you have a mild cheese, you might try marrying it with an exciting cracker full of sesame seeds, poppy seeds, dried onion … you get the idea. But there is a tipping point when cheese looses the stage to such a cracker. At that point why not just spread butter?
I wondered why Darkman hadn't shown this later set of lyrics to Peter Hook when it came time for him to remake the song, so that he could use them. So I asked Darkman about it. He told me that he didn't think they fit with the old rehearsal demos, in his opinion. I guess he preferred the old-school set, which is apparently the very first set of lyrics to the song.
I am suggesting we take ourselves less seriously.
Here is another excerpt I found in my archives. Hard to believe these words came from me… or any of the words I write these days come from me. You opened me up, wide open, and I just spill everywhere. All the love I have to give, all the feeling, it just comes gushing out for you.

“The song of songs, which is Solomon’s…”Have you ever been in love? I mean, head over heels, totally, helplessly in love? If you have, you know there’s no feeling like it in the world! Your mind is continuously on the one you love. It’s really not even something you can control, because they’re always right there, subconsciously….just there. That love gives meaning to your life, it causes you to do things you wouldn’t ordinarily do or say. It makes you feel like nothing else. Your emotions are totally engaged.
Recently what I've come to appreciate is the perfection of the present moment, even the seeming paradox of the perfect imperfection of the present moment. That's partly why after a two year absence I've decided to blog again. It really doesn't matter that in setting up this video I didn't have all the ingredients I'd have liked to use in an ideal world. Also, it would be wonderful, although not essential, to use a bicycle operated smoothie maker, but I didn't. Best just to do it; don't wait for the perfect moment as life passes you by!

Can you imagine a church in which every single person who walked through the door was welcomed as a member, already fully qualified to begin fully participating? Can you imagine a church in which the leaders understood themselves not as “gatekeepers” who serve by making sure things don’t get out of hand but, instead, as facilitators of the unleashing of everyone’s fullest potential? Can you imagine a church based on such radical trust?

In a boxing match, the boxers fight for a bit then head to their perspective corners to regroup for the next round. They get water, a quick rub down or bandage. Then there is the coach or trainer telling the boxer, “you can do it!” “you got this!” “looking good!” “you’re unstoppable!” Once the bell sounds for the next round, the boxer is recharged and comes out like a bull out the gate. All they see is victory and destiny. Losing is not even on their radar. You might as well call this one, because the determined one will come out the victor.

I pull the console table from behind the love seat to the side so that when my laptop is sitting on it the arm of the love seat is in full view since this is where I will bend over while I'm administering my own spanking. I've been instructed to have all my implements out and nearby so they are ready for use. I'm expected to have all of this set up before the time of our 'meeting'. The agreed upon time arrives and we meet up online with our webcams. I sit down in front of the webcam while my Daddy talks to me about why I'm getting this spanking and scolding me for being bad and misbehaving. He makes me look directly into the camera so that he's sure he has my full attention.
Needless to say I got a lot accomplished that day.
The problem with the second statistic is that it is very clearly illogical. Agents earn their income from commissions on sales--i.e., they get paid only if they sell something. If agents sold only 1 in every 100 manuscripts they represented, they couldn't make enough money to keep their doors open--except maybe the disreputable ones who charge fees. (Nor, with so few sales, is it likely that trade publishers would be able to churn out over 300,000 new titles a year in the USA alone.) And imagine the work load, if for every success you also had to market 99 duds! No agent will manage to sell every single manuscript--but no agent could possibly remain in business with such a high failure rate.
Ordinarily, elementary and secondary school experiences enforce study specifically toward the goals of passing exams. With fear and hope as tandem motivating factors, the shame of failure combines with the drive for timely completion. Between Chaucerian “fear fled with fury,” and Coleridge’s “work without hope draws nectar in a sieve,” potential joys in studies suffocate. Then, in the post-survival, comes the challenge of finding one’s own delight in learning that will last beyond time. For me, the steadily sweeter tastes evolved alongside my increased abilities to choose my own coursework- especially in graduate school.

How competitive are you? Do you know how to compete in the kingdom? Do you understand that being a part of the kingdom is about completing others rather than competing with others? ”I’m of Paul and another says I’m of Apollos” was the debate that went on among the Corinthians as they argued over who was their favorite apostle. I can imagine the debates, “Which apostle is more eloquent, who hears from God the best, who is the best teacher and of course who has the greatest anointing?” To that argument the Apostle Paul responds, “This attitude is carnal and not of God. None of us is more important than the other. Our focus should be to complete each other rather than compete with each other. God will reward each of us individually, according to each person’s labor and there is enough to go around.
At bottom, I suspect that there is a scientistic type of fundamentalism at work here. Multiverse theorists are more certain that divine causation can’t happen than they are of any of the premises of an argument that concludes divine causation can happen. I am not sure what else could explain their believing that the multiverse is the best explanation of the fine-tuning of our universe.

Parents and community members have very similar expressions of opposition especially considering the disregard for open, transparent dialogue with parents.

Even before the Pilgrims landed it was common practice for explorers to capture Indians, take them to Europe and sell them as slaves for 220 shillings apiece. The Pilgrims had hardly explored the shores of Cape Cod for four days before they had robbed the graves of my ancestors and stolen their corn and beans. Mourt's Relation describes a searching party of sixteen men. Mourt goes on to say that this party took as much of the Indians' winter provisions as they were able to carry.

When I get stuck at a point in my novel (as all writers do) and feel like the muses have abandoned me, I take a step back to look at the goal of the piece, usually with a wine cooler (or hot tea) in one hand and a sweet treat in the other. Both food and drink calm me, and focuses me, removing me from the irritating position I’m in of having the dreaded writer’s block. Sometimes I like to imagine what my characters would eat and drink under stress and I go find that. Unfortunately, I don’t drink beer, so if Derek (my male lead in Echo, the first novel I’m working on) would grab a cold Budweiser to ease his nerves, I resort to a Seagram’s Calypso Colada. If the name alone won’t inspire me, the taste will. Tara on the other hand (my female lead opposite Derek) is more of a teetotaler. She drinks the occasional wine (of which I do not) and calming teas (my choice of drink also) to help her work through her problems.
This past weekend and last night, Lexington had an explosive of people into the main campus bar area after every win.

“I pretend to be gay,” he says. “Women love having gay boyfriends who’ll go shopping with them and tell them their ass looks great.

I think it will be especially prevalent, considering the vast amount of people who are just commencing social media as we speak. These individuals haven’t even thought of the implications of their networking behavior. Not only could the negativity of social media correlate to privacy issues, but I think it could also be damaging to an individuals’ innate mentality and connection to the physical world.
In the moderate implementation: 1) those hiring illegal immigrants would be punishable by a fine of up to £5,000; 2) road maintenance and street cleaning would be deprioritized in Muslim areas, and diversion of county and national tax revenues to make up for the weak tax base in these areas would cease; 3) Muslim residents of the UK without British citizenship would be refused re-entry to the UK if there were suspicion of their involvement in terrorist/jihadist activity; 4) authorities would turn a blind eye to attacks on mosques, or on Muslims in general; 5) anyone of Muslim heritage convicted of a violent or sexual crime would be deported, without the right of appeal, to their country of origin.
One of the major ways (and I believe more important that the things I listed above) is to prepare by thoroughly immersing ourselves in God's word. This year more than ever before we have chosen to make God's word a priority in our lives. We have been reading it more often and memorizing more. We have been discussing it and seeking to apply it to our lives. A chapter we recently memorized was Hebrews 11-12:3, It is chapter all about people of faith and what they went through and still stood firm because they were looking ahead to their reward (heaven). What a great thing to have in our minds whenever we face trials! We are now working on the book of James and it is just filled with verses that can also encourage and inspire us if/ when we go through hard times. This sort of preparing is useful for any type of situation!

I woke up this morning with a slightly different view from today's inspiration: It's my Birthday, today, I'm the big 31 :) So I thought, what if I make my own birthday card? What would it look like? So I decided I would make something I would want to receive :)
"However, recently some of their children wanted to exercise their eligibility for dual-citizenship so they went through the process as a family."
Lentils are a great source of fiber and iron. Just one serving (1/4 cup dry, about 1/2 cup cooked) packs 9 grams of fiber, about 36% of the standard daily recommended amount, and 15% of the standard daily recommended amount of iron. Not too shabby for a tiny little legume! I will definitely be using these in future recipes, so expect a lentil soup recipe very soon!

Actually, I'll take a third issue with the above: the whole "soles/souls" cleverness. Instead of being a witty turn of phrase, this reminds me rather severely of "The Shoe People". Shoes with souls?
Your cold is usually just to get from one end of a affiliated to the other, admitting there’s aswell no curtailment of annual collection. As accepted as this sounds, it’s the agency that sets Boscage Climber apart, as about all of the controls in the bold are handled by the L and R accept buttons. If DK is on solid ground–which, as you advance through the game, becomes beneath and beneath frequent–the L and R buttons will move him to the larboard or right. Tap them both at the aloft time, and he’ll bound into the air. Already he’s airborne, the L and R buttons accord to DK’s larboard and adapted hands, which he can use to grab assimilate the pegs, pegboards, switches, and added peglike altar that yield up abundant of the complete acreage in the game’s about bottomless, angular aggressive levels.
The Meantime Smoked Back arrived and I tasted cautiously. While still retaining the malty, smokey taste of the Rauchbier it was a lot more subtle, suiting a wider audience. While caught in my one man tasting session I was oblivious to Lou being short changed by a tenner. The waitress was apologetic and slightly embarrassed and all the more so when she did exactly the same thing to the next table. Perhaps its time for the Drinkery to invest in some product training and calculators. Leaving after the one beer, it won't be somewhere I would return to out of choice but if faced with it as a best alternative I wouldn't say no to a Sierra Nevada.
There are three main traits that I look for when developing a relationship — credibility, integrity and authenticity.
The reason this golden apple knows so much about music is that she works for MTV, or maybe, she works at MTV because she knows so much about music...
Like the heroic passengers of flight 93, good people of conscience set the bar high for all of us, and in turn, we responded beautifully.The next day, like many of my neighbors, like many of yours, I'm sure, I rushed to the craft store for red-white-and blue ribbon, but there was none to be had. The shelves were picked clean by the dozens of people already in line to cash out or waiting for the bow-makers to create a patriotic tribute for them.
The road outside my door is shiny with treachery, layers of ice just lying in wait for the feet of my van to slip and slide, and send me into failure, or a ditch. Or, The Ditch of Failure.

As he wandered into the back part of the shop, Genna moved up to the counter to put her tray down, and snuck a glance at what was on the other tray sitting in front of the small microwave. The coffee shop used it to heat up things like cookies and specialty sandwiches, but they didn’t serve things as mundane as hot dogs.
That is the main topic in our work placr with the big news that not just site engineers are in the list, but administrative and Project managers as well.
Well, my non-existent followers that is.
You don’t even wait til it passes. You can change your mindset right now, right here, at this moment and turn things around.
Given that the BFP currently claims 724 members, has its own website, is supported by a number of bloggers, possesses links with the EDL and has been covered in the national press (e.g. The Independent), should not the expectation be that it ought to fare better electorally than a party of circa 60 members that possesses a rudimentary website, no supporting network of bloggers and has zero visibility? Well, such a party does exist, and it is called the Democratic Nationalists. Despite the fact that to all intents and purposes it is invisible, its five candidates clocked up the following results on Thursday (the first three wards being in Bradford, the fourth in Doncaster and the fifth in Pendle): Royds - 453 votes, 15.1%; Tong - 276 votes, 11.5%; Wyke - 313 votes, 9.6%; Stainforth and Moorends - 410 votes, 16.6%; Waterside - 92, 7.8%. If the Democratic Nationalists could achieve this, why did the BFP poll even more abysmally? The DNs even managed to beat both the Respect and Liberal Democrat candidates in Wyke. Overall, the DNs averaged 309 votes per candidate with a 12.1% share, whereas the BFP equivalent figures were 51 and 1.93%.
Russia’s black population hasn’t been officially counted, but some studies estimate about 40,000 “Afro-Russians.” Scores of them suffer racially motivated attacks every year — 49 in Moscow in 2009, according to the Moscow Protestant Chaplaincy Task Force on Racial Violence and Harassment, an advocacy group.

Ten years ago, Claire Dederer put her back out while breastfeeding her baby daughter. Told to try yoga by everyone from the woman behind the counter at the co-op to the homeless guy on the corner, she signed up for her first class. She fell madly in love.
In 1968 the United States Congress passed P.L. 100-89, which restored Federal recognition to this tribe, the southernmost tribe of the Pueblo Indians. In addition, the state of Texas recognized the tribe. The Yselta del Sur Pueblo Tribe has approximately 3000 citizens living on tribal grounds.

The story of our recent house selling/buying was a real, true miracle. For months and months I thought about it everyday. How grateful I was that everything happened the way it did. We were so blessed.

If you're a part of the military family, then you know that during the summer months there is a huge peak in receiving permanent change of station orders, also known as PCS orders. At our current duty station, we've been here 3 years this summer. I've been a part of the military - as veteran and a wife - going 8.5 years, if you include my poolee time too. So, I have looked forward to the constant change of locations, meeting new people, exploring, being the gypsy soul I am. A month or so ago, I found out that we are not going anywhere anytime soon. I allowed myself to angry, sad, frustrated, pity party for a a couple of days, and then as usual, I move on. I was really looking forward to a new change of pace.
Christ is the perfect Lead, in dancing, or in life. He knows where we will end up, and he knows when the song will end. Just like life.

I am off to go and workout. I actually met the gym goddess yesterday and she is really nice. Bitch! She asked me if I was a hairdresser. Which I get that question alot and despite really wanting to believe its because my hair is so awesome I know its because most women can only fathom a hairdresser wearing their hair so short. "I wish I could wear my hair like yours" Which is what the perfect girl told me as she took her waist length hair out of her ponytail and it literally bounced on her back as it glistened in the sunshine (and it rained yesterday) . I almost told her to shut the hell up but I just smiled and offered her a power bar. Cause I'm nice like that.
*First off, Happy Spring! I love all the flowers popping up and the leaves growing on the trees!
This whole autumn-into-winter has been remarkably mild. As a bicyclist and former desert dweller, I appreciate this tremendously.
Not sure why, but I never got to paint all the weapon options… which was just stupid. With a possible two upcoming tourneys, and even though I have a painted metal Juggernaut, I decided it was finally time to paint his plastic kit open hand. And of course I sat and also painted de Marauder’s pistons and the Decimator’s gun.
Work has been incredibly busy lately. Mainly b/c I'm training my temp replacement who will be here when I go on Maternity leave. It's exhausting to spend 8+hours talking!! Plus, poor girl gets me at my most flightly.. I'm all over the place!! I start one conversation and end up talking about the most random things! I went home last night and probably had the best night of sleep I've had in months.. just from all the talking and walking I did yesterday!! hmmmm.. maybe I should keep this habit up.. will get more sleep!!
All summer long, trees shade the sidewalks, shade the balconies and filter the intense South American sun.
Net and Season are laughing so hard they're crying. I try again, using a different tack.
I imagined the numbers yelling “All in the name of liberty! Got to be free! JAlLBREAK!” as they scaled the prison walls. To this day, I can’t get this song out of my head when I teach this topic.
I wonder if it is something I am going to get over, or if it is something that will always be difficult for me.
Position a rack in the center of the oven, and heat the oven to 425 degrees. Butter a popover pan or standard muffin tin, and place it in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until it is hot.
The Washington Post said the BEST study had ‘settled the climate change debate’ and showed that anyone who remained a sceptic was committing a ‘cynical fraud’.

This was on my heart to share today. I think of this passage often, as I think about death often, and often it troubles me. This excerpt and the beautiful Bible truths it illustrates, soothe my troubled spirit. I hope it helps someone out there, too.
I was also asked to intern in the rehearsal room for Playwriting Australia’s National Script Workshop. It will be a great experience to witness this workshop process and I am sure it will offer me some invaluable lessons in the development of my own work!
With more chickens arriving this spring, I’ve been reassessing our current housing. Prior to blogging about our mini farming adventures, we purchased a chicken coop advertised to hold 16 birds and built a run accordingly with 20 square feet per chicken (8′x40′) so they would have plenty of room to be happy chickens when they aren’t free ranging. We are quite proud of the run. It is a sturdy construction, fully enclosed in hardware cloth, which is also partially buried underground. Needless to say, we’ve never had a predator problem inside the run. It’s a Fort Knox. My husband even installed a corrugated roof over the coop and food so the ladies and I would have a dry spot while doing our daily chores.
So is historical fiction cheating or is it raising the bar on the already daunting task of creating a compelling novel?

The theatre was packed at the end of the term for ‘Bedales’s Got Talent’, a fundraiser set up by the Block 4 Charities Project. 11 diverse acts from all Blocks competed, with dance, music and magic. The quality was exceptional and the smooth running of the show was guaranteed by the skilled compering of Roly Botha (Block 4). The judges, who included representatives of Enable Ability and the Elizabeth Foundation, awarded first prize to Theo Sandberg (Block 4) for his highly original and accomplished guitar playing. Before Graham Banks finished the evening with a band featuring the stunning guitar talents of Neil Hornsby and Jamie West-Oram the audience had the rare treat of a performance from former world juggling champion Freddy Sheed (6.2) who came out of retirement for the evening. Thank you to all who helped raise £1,300 for the Charities Project. View photos.
Finally I want to leave you with a couple still life screenshots. I mentioned in my first post on this series that there were some very nice deep background images (especially architectural ones), but there have also been great looking close-ups, including many illustrations of the two bunnies that Minami and Youko have on their phones.
That doesn't even include the book I haven't worked on in months because I haven't had time or energy. I live in a strange paradox where I have nothing but time on my hands yet I don't have the time to get done anything I want to get done. It doesn't help that another birthday approaches this week and that April in general is a miserable month for me. T.S. Eliot got that one right.

Ah ha I thought. I can put some causal element of my bronchiectasis down to the stupity of so-called scientific medicine in my childhood. But not so apparently. The subsequent medical studies make it very clear that, while most T's and A's carried out when I was a child were a pointless waste of time and money, the removal of a child's tonsils and adenoids did no harm whatsoever to the child's immune system then or in the future.
I think I need a new bush jacket. I have no idea how old mine is and it is getting a bit thin.
If your plans are in line with what God knows is best for you, and we all know how often that happens… Well we can plan, but do not get attached. Ask Jesus first what needs to happen, and go with what He is telling you. Your plans are not His plans, and His ways are not our ways. So don’t go to Jesus looking for magic Jesus dust to make all your dreams come true, go to Jesus asking what His dreams are for you, and live into that, because that is the best way to go.
When you have this in your backyard, it's not a difficult decision to pack a last minute picnic and head out into the mountains. No arm twisting required. Forget about the grass that needs mowing. Getting away from it all, if even for a few hours, can be just what this family needs.

Today in my email, I got a letter from Matt Rhoades of the Romney campaign to ask me to donate money. I subscribe to both Obama and Romney's campaigns because I'm keeping an eye on it to try to see how both campaigns are utilizing the Internet. So far they both are actually doing some interesting things.

“It’s worth noting that I first arrived on the national stage with a speech at the Democratic Convention that was entirely about American exceptionalism, and that my entire career has been a testimony to American exceptionalism. But I will cut folks some slack for now because they’re still trying to get their nomination.” He’s so full of it his eyes are brown. This President has had nothing if not contempt for the notion of American Exceptionalism.
This book is well written with credible characters and I give it a 4 out of 5 star rating.
How cool is this?! I mean, to hold so much control, so much power over your life. I understand that crappy things are still going to happen but if we respond instead of react, the results of those crappy things will be completely different. A response is something you think about and then do. A reaction is exactly that – action without premeditation. It’s like a parallel universe. In one, life sucks and so does everything in it. In the other, you never have to have a bad day again. It’s totally our choice!

Sure, playing outside can be dangerous, but (I think) no one would argue that we shouldn't let kids play outside. I wrote this list to make a point: everything we do, everything we let our kids do can be dangerous.

Green tea is appetite suppressor. By drinking Green Tea, you will feel like eating less. This reduces your calorie consumption, and helps lose weight. Green tea can be used to replace coffee, soda, and energy drinks to save calories, while still giving you the energy you need to get through the day.

They are competitively priced with other brands, and have gained a considerable foothold in the various fields of construction, owing to the durable design and superior workmanship.
So, mom writing a medical journal about herself is no surprise to me. At first I thought it was nuts. However, as I’ve aged and jumped on this wagon ride known as senescence, I’ve thought about it and changed my mind. Maybe I should leave behind some kind of medical timeline for my future gayby too. It’s good to know the good, the bad, and the ugly of the human body and what better source to learn this information from than your primary caregiver – Mom.

This idea of not having to start from the very begining seemed to convince a few fans and now people now seem to expect backwards compatibility when buying a ‘new’ generation of machine. It’s probably no coincidence that ‘new’ generations start of with backwards compatibility, or at least start off promising it, and are then quite happy to drop it.

If you know me, you know that about 1/3 of my bead stash is seed beads (incl. shapes like drops, twin, tila etc), 1/3 are Czech beads (seeds and some Preciosa crystal, but mostly pressed glass and fire-polished) and 1/3 is a mix of everything else. So not only did I win beads, which is really fab in itself, but also beads in a colour scheme I like and, above all: it's czech beads! (And info about czech beads, which is also great for a bead nerd/"bead colour collector" like me even if it might sound strange to be so pleased about getting promotional material.)

“The Cooperative, which runs many supermarkets and other businesses, for instance, was founded by workers as part of the labour movement. But today, despite its lack of shareholders, it is hardly distinguishable from a normal capitalist firm. Its workers certainly do not see much difference; the GMB union has clashed more than once with Coop management. (Talk to anyone who’s worked at John Lewis for a similar, but worse, picture)”

Weakness: The 49ers have been able to get away with playing a seven-man rotation in conference play, but that’s not going to cut it in the NCAA tournament. This team faltered down the stretch at Creighton and part of that was due to fatigue. Not having guys you can depend on to produce when your starters need a rest is a problem and could be the reason their tournament run ends before they’d like.

Meanwhile, trade flows swell, international organizations, proliferate, more countries attempt democracy, and fewer of those democracies fail. The nexus of these trends almost certainly lies in the functional links between democracy and economic development–links that promote exactly the kind of positive feedback loops Pierson identifies as a key mechanism for path-dependent change in political institutions. When governments discover they cannot survive by force alone, they must find ways to secure the habitual, quasi-voluntary compliance of the populations they seek to rule. To secure that compliance, they need to promote prosperity and remove incentives to rely on force as a means to effect political change.

Dear Golddigger,It meant a great deal to me that you would send a message regarding our extra stress at this time. The guy who delivered the new fridge arrived a little past nine--he was alone and extremely competent in measuring just what had to be moved to facilitate bringing the new fridge in and old one out. He helped enormously by emptying the old and assisting in filling the new. He left just 10 minutes before we left for the hospital. The cats were three hours past their suppertime--such meowing.Thanks for thinking of us, Doris

You would think that because I have been studying the paranormal since the 3rd grade that I would be impervious to the shadows of the night. That my nerve would be as strong as unicorn hair and as unwavering as a binding spell. I wish it were true. If I had a name in the Supernatural Realm it would be this, Scaredy Cat. Yep, that’s me. I am the first to jump at a sound in the night. I had to strictly enforce a “No scary movie when it’s dark” rule in my 30′s because I would literally lie awake in terror all night long. I do believe in spooks, I do, I do believe in spooks! It’s not that I have ever encountered a spirit or disembodied voice. My husband and sister both have their personal experiences with ghosts to tell. I have no story. And maybe that’s just as well. The ones I am reading are about all my muggle mind can handle.

But when one is there just to be "an author" (subtext "any author"), it's so much harder. How can you be interesting for the several hundredth time answering "where do you get your ideas from?" or "how long does it take to write a book?" It makes me want to chew my arm off.

Holding my girlfriend by a hand he looked like a gay snake whisperer. He was equally disgusting to those other two guys that were also present in the room. In fact it was not that much of disgust but something rather parodic about them, they reminded me of that “nazi” guys from Big Lebowski.
They tell you that English is too difficult to learn and that standards must be lowered. They tell you that blacks who speak correct English are traitors trying to be white. They tell you that despite the fact that showing proper ID is required to board an airplane and a gazillion other things, requiring ID to vote will disenfranchise blacks. Thus, their message is that blacks are too stupid to acquire ID...
I love plain white restaurant style over sized dishes. They are crisp and clean and show off food perfectly, except for pale food. I also love dishes that bring a whole new feel to the table. Fantasy, old world, holiday, formality. I also prefer a mix. I get bored with design if it is all the same. Coordinated is better for me. Unless it is a theme in color, I can work with that. I have a bit of OCD, my Christmas tree, the ookie stuff on the top where the toothpaste comes out and where the kitchen dish soap squeezes out, and yes, I need a minimum of 8 in the kitchen. 8 matching pieces of things. There is no mixture of cups or glasses in my cupboards. Weird, sure, but it works for me. Also, I never spend a lot. I mean really? Oops and a $25 dish is broken?

Perhaps the most widely known work on the measurement of moralism is that by Kohlberg (1969). His work has been also extended into the political field by Hampden-Turner & Whitten (1971). Kohlberg, however, makes the assumption that the stages of moral development he sees in (some) children can be equated with a scale of adult morality. Thus a person is 'more' moral if he exhibits decision-rationales similar to those children whom Kohlberg considers to be more morally developed. It will be evident that this is a rather arbitrary approach. Even if some children do go through these stages in a regular progression, this of itself is no criterion for saying that they are 'more' moral than when they started out. What would we say of a person who went through all Kohlberg's six stages and then went 'back' to Kohlberg's second stage? An answer to this question would surely reveal that the criterion for what is 'moral' exists only in Kohlberg's own set of values -- however plausible they may seem. Surely even if most people behaved as in the case given above, Kohlberg would still want to say that they were 'going back'. He would not want to regard the final stage as 'higher'. The 'scale' is thus imposed on the data rather than being derived from it. A less contentious scale of moralism would, therefore be highly desirable. Some sort of explicit and value-free measure of moralism is necessary. This is, of course, no easy task. It is easy enough to measure an attitude, but with moralism we want to measure something about how an attitude is held or justified. We want to measure a characteristic of attitudes. Even more difficult, we want a measure that will not be ideologically biased. As was pointed out, one can be moralistic about a wide variety of issues. If we want to examine whether Leftists are more or less moralistic, we cannot simply ascertain how many of a set of supposedly 'Left-wing moralistic' statements they agree with. They would obviously agree with them not only because they are moralistic but also because they are Left-wing. What we want to do is sort out the two possible bases for agreement. Only thus can we empirically examine whether moralism is characteristic of the Right, of the Left or of neither. Although the present author is something of a psychometric specialist with a long list of contributions to the measurement of psychological dispositions to his credit (Ray, 1970 a & b, 1971 a, b & c, 1972 a to g ), any idea at all for a solution to this problem eluded him for some years. As it is, what is presented in the following sections must be viewed as only a preliminary attempt at the objective measurement of moralism.
“While natural gas production is carried out by private firms, and States are the primary regulators of onshore oil and gas activities, the Federal Government has an important role to play by regulating oil and gas activities on public and Indian trust lands, encouraging greater use of natural gas in transportation, supporting research and development aimed at improving the safety of natural gas development and transportation activities, and setting sensible, cost-effective public health and environmental standards to implement Federal law and augment State safeguards,” the executive order says.
Now the greedy private sector taxpayers, the weirdo 95% of citizens without state pensions, who are responsible for paying for Mr. Corn’s $152,490.84 annual pension, contribute 6.2% to their own pension (called Social Security) and at age 62 after 40 years of contributions can take down a huge maximum pension of $22,260 annually or about one-seventh of Mr. Corn’s annual pension. So Mr. Corn contributes at a rate 22% higher but for 9 fewer years but receives 7 times the pension. And Mr. Corn retired earlier too at age 59. What a terrible deal for Mr. Corn. No wonder he is complaining.

My first project is a Tim Holtz inspired vintage tag. To me, anything vintage is romantic, and romance is what Valentine's Day is all about, right? The tag is cut from kraft CS using a Sizzix XL die. I stamped images and distressed the tag using TH Distress Ink. Of course the birdcage and bird were cut from the TH Sizzix die. I looked for this die forever and finally found it at a local craft store (had to pay regular price for it!). I added a vintage-y SU brad on top, with mini roses (Photo Craft), and some Maya Road fibers. The pink sweetheart flowers (Photo Craft), lace trim (Fabric Mart) and pearl strand (Wal-Mart) were all from local stores.

I suppose the point is that it's fine to give away details of your work in progress as long as you don't give away enough of the central idea to risk compromising its originality. Maybe this is the grown-up version of 'will they steal my idea?' As soon as the publisher produces the catalogue, the central premise is there for all to see anyway. But by then, the books are in press and it's a bit late for someone else to start from scratch.
On occasion, my family likes to quote Barbara Robinson’s infamous Herdman family from her novel The Best Christmas Pageant Ever. Now, with illustrations by Laura Cornell, Robinson has adapted her classic story for a younger audience. I love the unexpected qualities of this story. Just try not to laugh out loud when little Gladys Herdman interprets the Angel of the Lord as a comic book character who shrieks, “Shazam!” But when Imogene, the rudest, bossiest, nastiest Herdman finally appears in the pageant as Mary, quiet and reverent and tearful, I defy any reader not to get emotional along with the awed church audience. Robinson’s story is edited here, but it keeps the requisite humor parents expect from the original. Cornell, who illustrated Is There Really a Human Race? and It’s Hard to Be Five, is the perfect artist to pair with this story. Her pictures are raucous, chaotic, and full of mischief–just like those terrible, wonderful Herdmans!
Also last summer, another incident took place at a hotel in Billings, Montana. We had arrived in Billings a day earlier than planned and so the pastor of the church we were visiting wasn't yet expecting us. We were packing up our vehicle the next morning. I was in and out carrying luggage. I remember passing by a man, and one glance at him told me all I needed to know -- creep alert! It was about a half-hour later when I was in the room and my dad and brother were outside that they heard a horrifying scream and a woman yelling, "Get away from me! Get away from me!" My dad said that scream left him shaken for hours afterward. My mom was walking down the hall of the hotel a short time later when the manager (who was a lady) and a cleaning maid were walking from the opposite end. The maid was in tears and sobbing her heart out. We found out that the poor girl had been attacked by a man in the room she was cleaning. We were shocked and frightened. That could have been me or one of my sisters. That man could very easily have grabbed one of us as we walked by and dragged us into a room. We left that hotel quite shaken, needless to say. It makes me wonder how often things like that happen in hotels; if that pervert and others have a habit of walking into hotels and taking advantage of unsuspecting girls on a regular basis. It wouldn't surprise me. We need to be so careful.
When his son Joseph Clayton (1847-1923), in turn, entered the profession in 1867, taking over a studio in Blackfriars Street, London, he too styled himself in the fashion of an artist photographer. With lofty ambitions, his first carte de visite mounts were ordered from the printers with the name Byron Clayton, supplemented by the description, "Parliamentary & Portrait Photographer," perhaps more aspirational than by actual appointment.

Whilst I thought Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as family matriarch Elizabeth Collins Stoddard, other actors were not given enough role in which to shine. These included Jackie Earle Haley as drunken handyman Willie Loomis who was relegated from the character who discovered Barnabas (in earlier versions) to little more than a vampire's chauffeur with little else to do. The sin of this was that Haley gave a highlight performance as Rorschach in Watchmen and could have given much more to this film, given the chance. Child of the family David (Gulliver McGrath) was little more than a cipher for part of the finale. Roger Collins (Jonny Lee Miller, Dracula 2001) was pointless and disposed of later in the film with some embarrassment due to the fact that the script had nothing for him to do. The characters of Maggie Evans and Victoria Winter were merged into one, played by Bella Heathcote, who may have been the reincarnation of or haunted by Josette, the script wasn’t sure, but who vanished for a huge slice of film.
“Where you come from?” It’s a short, seemingly insignificant word, that auxiliary verb, but it makes all the difference – ”Where do you come from?” is correct. And the softer, more natural question “Where are you from?” is an even better choice.

Optionally, if you only wish to make Challah without making the pudding, you can opt to sprinkle sesame seeds or poppy seeds onto the bread prior to baking, and incorporate raisins into the dough (soaked for an hour in warm water or brandy).
The One who saw what I could be- instead of what I was.
A few years ago I was a summer intern for a literary agency in London. In the midst of reading the slush pile and going to the post office, I had the good fortune to meet a few of the agency's authors. One of them was the brilliant, inspiring and kind Hisham Matar. His debut novel In the Country of Men was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2006 and it was in the process of being translated into 28 languages. Hisham said some lovely things about my own writing (I had written a manuscript report for an author friend of his), invited me to lunch along with the agents at his new writing studio, and even got me a book for my birthday (What is Britishness?, in case you were wondering).
The reality of intimacy always takes time to develop, especially after being compromised. But your commitment to re-establishing it can happen today-for anyone willing to take the dare.

After lunch, I popped in to New Belgium's brewery for, say, 3 minutes, to see if I could find NB's Flander's-style Brown ale, La Folie.

Collins, it seemed like a fun place to be for more than lunch, but that will have to wait for another trip.

In the unfinished Mystery of Edwin Drood, a foul murder is suspected and the main suspect is John Jasper. The late great Leon Garfield wrote a splendid completion of the book - utterly convincing - which I keep beside the collected novels. If that wasn't how Dickens was going to end it, it should have been: the convicted man waiting in his cell for the 8 o clock of his last morning on earth, knowing that there will be no reprieve and no spangly Christmas fairy coming down with a wand to make all things well.

The cyberspace is already packed with informative tidbits.

I really did not know how I would react to “SOLOMON NORTHRUP’S ODYSSEY” when I first saw it so many years ago. After all, the movie had not been directed by someone from the established Hollywood community or from any of the film industries overseas. Gordon Parks was a well-established photographer who had worked for “LIFE” magazine and a documentary director, before turning his attention to directing films. And before “SOLOMON NORTHRUP’S ODYSSEY”, he had only directed eight films, his most successful being the 1971 movie “SHAFT”. I must admit that Parks did a first-rate job in his direction of the movie, but I would not go as far to say that it was perfect.

If the police ask for the password to your electronic device, you can politely refuse to provide it and ask to speak to your lawyer. Every arrest situation is different, and you will need an attorney to help you sort through your particular circumstance. Note that just because the police cannot compel you to give up your password, that doesn’t mean that they can’t pressure you. The police may detain you and you may go to jail rather than being immediately released if they think you’re refusing to be cooperative. You will need to decide whether to comply.

She is bright and beautiful and full of light, especially because she will be reflecting the new energy from the Sun to Earth. The Photon Belt is also here and this magnetic energy is coming to Earth in waves and stirring up our emotions and our lives.
Murder is an external sin. It is obvious and visible. It is easy to condemn the murderer. But Jesus tells us to take care less we even have a seething anger against another. Our anger can be visible or invisible. It matters not; we have the seeds of murder in our heart, and we had best uproot them by the Father’s grace. And so Jesus teaches about a life lived and judged by attitudes in the heart. There is nothing here by which we can judge others. We can only take His words, and by the illumination of the Holy Spirit, judge our own lives and move to change.

There is no clear beginning or ends to situations, because, again, these paths are unpredictable; you never know when you will have to cross already treaded ground to get to a brand new landscape.

If you are more into mermaids, though, you might consider FORBIDDEN SEA. I'm reading all the mermaid stuff I can get my hands on, and this is by far one of the best books I've read lately. GREAT characters, dramatic action, and more--emotional stakes that are rare in a lot of the books I've read lately. I became very attached to the main character very quickly, and her relationships with others on the tiny island were compelling all the way through. Only the undersea world was a bit of a disappointment, for it was made into some sort of utopia, yet its realities seemed less than desirable to me. Besides, I don't believe in utopias. I won't tell the ending, but I admit it made me happy, open-ended as it was. I can't wait to find more by Sheila A. Nielson. Her writing is refreshingly meaningful.

"There is an increasing acceptance by the traffic engineering and urban planning professions to the concept that carparking should not become and end in itself, but be recognized as only one phase of overall planning and transportation policies. It is further recognized that carparking policies and pricing can have a major influence upon the successful implementation of transport programs. Simply put, cheap parking encourages heavy usage of the private auto, and concurrently requires larger parking facilities and costly roadway improvement works.

If Lewin's only impact on social psychology was his training of future researchers he would still be considered a giant in the field. And yet, I think his biggest contribution can be attributed to his greatest theoretical idea: the power of the situation. In essence, Lewin believed that people are a product of the interaction of (1) their past experiences, with (2) the current situational context. This was a radical idea in 1937, when most scientific theories rested on the notion that behavior was based largely, or even entirely, on learned associations or traits. In other words, Nature was everything and Nuture mattered little (today, some psychologists still think this way). I think the debate about Nature v. Nurture or Genes v. Environment is a little misplaced, and Lewin would agree.
