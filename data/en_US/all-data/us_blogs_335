Then there was South Park. A different kettle of fish. A funnier kettle of fish, anyway. Inappropriate for my kids? Probably. I remember the first episode I watched with my son, the one that featured Kyle and his dirt-poor family taking part in a humiliating canned food grab on Thanksgiving Day. Hilarious and brutal satire.

The final five minutes was back and forth with three ties and six lead changes. Central Oklahoma’s Tyler Phillips tied it at 62-62 on a put back with 4:20 left. After a Justin Ikhide free throw, Davis gave the Bronchos a 65-63 lead with a three pointer at the 3:33 mark. Chris Sights answered for Emporia State with 2:50 left on a three of his own for a 66-65 Hornet lead. Phillips hit another trey to make it 68-66 Central Oklahoma with 2:32 remaining. Derrell Conner gave Emporia State the lead back with a three pointer with 1:21 left. Johnny Stephene hit a pair of free throws with 12.3 seconds left to give Central Oklahoma their final lead at 70-69. The Bronchos had a foul to give with 8.1 seconds left and Emporia State called a timeout after the foul. Pierce then got the ball in the lane and was fouled by Josh Davis with 5.2 seconds left. He hit both free throws to reach double figures and move Emporia State to 3-1 on the season.

After flicking through the pages of this great book I decided it would be a good idea to tick off the beers that I’d already had. Now, in hindsight this was not the cleverest thing to do, given my predisposition to slightly obsessive behaviour, and I’m sure you can imagine where I went from there.

They are now without a faction headquarter as half the dauntless have become traitors and the other half has seeked refuge in another faction. They end up in Amity seeking refuge from the faction that believes in peace keeping and no involvement. Eventually, because they are Dauntless and cannot help it, they move on to another location because they are not completely welcomed. This is when they head to the Faction less territory where we meet Four's mother Evelyn.
Instead of kissing, humans who want to make peace should do what we gorillas do: bring about a controlled collision between their rumps. It takes real courage to turn your back on a rival and stick out your behind, trusting that he will do the same rather than kicking your arse or attempting some other unspeakable act. If President Obama started booty-bumping all the hostile characters who show up in the UN building, the Age of Universal Love might finally dawn.
At no point is any dissenting voice allowed to be heard. The tobacco industry is forbidden from lobbying the government and smokers themselves are never considered to be 'stakeholders'. From top to bottom, the decision-making process is controlled by a small elite of unaccountable, unelected anti-smoking prohibitionists living off the taxpayers' dime.

What makes you feel like a rebel stamper?
We have a busy busy week this week, so we are not actually painting at all 'till next week.. Dentist appointments, parent-teacher (cough) conferences (I never like these - even though they often turn out to be harmless), birthday parties (for family members and myself =) ), volleyball tournament, service auction.. And I'm sure I'm forgetting things. Ah, yes, I knew I was. I am working a lot on a piece of music for the school choir. This has involved consulting my gifted pianist friend (the one who played in a band for a few years and is essentially a professional musician even though she can't read the left hand on piano music). She is very very talented, though, and she can play ragtime, rock and roll and everything.
I turned and shifted back into my car. My fingertips started to tingle. The door opened and a tall, slinky, severe looking man with thin hair and a leather jacket came out with a gun. He swiftly pointed the barrel at the spot where I just escaped. His eyes traced the street; he even walked a few feet up and down the street before he went back inside.

One of the major problems with the “water wars” thesis is that it includes only a cursory understanding of “scarcity” issues, and of the actual facts and figures that underlie much of the analysis. Commonly, a threshold figure of 1,000 cu m per person per year is provided as the level below which states are said to be “water scarce.” In the case of Nile Basin states, this ranks Burundi, Rwanda, Egypt, Ethiopia, and Kenya all as water “scarce” by 2025, and depending on population growth, they may possibly be joined by Tanzania.

Entrust your loved ones to me; release them into my protective care. They are much safer with Me than in your clinging hands. If you let a loved one become an idol in your heart, you endanger that one--as well as yourself. Remember the extreme measures I used with Abraham and Isaac. I took Isaac to the very point of death to free Abraham from son-worship. Both Abraham and Isaac suffered terribly because of the father's undisciplined emotions. I detest idolatry, even in the form of parental love.

I had been following Jager closely as he (and Derrick) came up through the years here in IL. He, no doubt, had and has tremendous potential. I was surprised, as were many, at his decision to go pro after 1 year at Wisconsin. I was doubtful it would work out that early on. I was very, very wrong. I still think his best event may be the mile as his 3:54 at Pre this year indicates. I can say the same about German as well after his wire to wire victory in the NCAA 1500.

Genesee sent me a box full of Dundee samples (not related to the Genesee beers in the previous post -- that was bought and paid for...by Sam, for me), and one was a new one: Dundee Irish Red Lager. Reminds me of the Killian's, but with a sharper edge up front, and a sweeter, smoother finish. Again, this is a good non-hoppy beer, and there are people out there who like craft beer that isn't hopped to the nines. I'm betting this would be good with aged, firm cheeses, or beef stews. It's pretty good on its own.

Finally we thought we had better inquire whether or not mother had been able to get a boat. We went into the hall and happened to meet the chief dining-room steward. He told us that he had just seen my mother, and that she had not yet been put into a boat. We found her, and were told that they were loading the forward boats on the port side from the deck below. The ship had a substantial list to port, which made quite a space between the side of the ship and the life boats, swinging out over the water, so the crew stretched folded steamer chairs across the space, over which the people were helped into the boats. We proceeded to the deck below. Father, mother and the maid went ahead of Long and myself.

That day, the boys fished at a friend's private lily ponds, stocked with tilapia, catfish, and koi. The fish were practically jumping onto the hooks. Dan lost count somewhere around 12 fish, and caught about 16. Andy even caught one without bait -- he put an empty hook right back in after catching a fish, and caught a tilapia.

For once in my life, I don’t plan tomorrow out. I don’t try to figure out where my relationship is heading. I smile when life is beginning to get bumpy, and when I’m sad — yes, I am learning to let myself cry. I’m stopping to smell the roses a little more. Enjoying my weekends off, and seeing my friends more. I spend time with the family and I am getting my behind up off the couch more and running around. I didn’t try to be happy. I didn’t plan on anything, that’s for sure. It appears that when the worst moment of my life, over-ruled all of my other emotions, life did something amazing. It turned over a new leaf for me. Life, worked itself out. For the first time in so very long… I am genuinely happy. I don’t care what tomorrow brings. Good or bad, I know I can face what ever tomorrow throws at me… and I couldn’t be more in love with life.
My daughter had a boyfriend once who had OCD. You wouldn’t know he had it to look at him. He didn’t wear a badge or anything although you can get them. But it dominated his life. The thing is he knew he had OCD just like I know I’m a depressive and many people know what they are and they almost say it with something akin to pride especially if they’ve sat a test and “passed” – See! See! That proves it! The problem with having a diagnosis like this is that you start to see the word through OCD- or depressive- or ISTJ-coloured glasses and modify your behaviour to fit with what some textbook says you ought to behave like. I’m a depressive so you wouldn’t expect to see me playing air guitar and singing along to ‘Born in the USA’ but I can assure you I have. You’d certainly never get me doing it in front of an audience, not even my wife, although when my daughter was wee I would have been more willing to make a fool of myself for her benefit and I suspect that’s still the case.

It can take a few failed attempts before the subject is in frame, but then it’s getting them in the right part of the frame that you want them to be in when you take the shot. And that can take time. Or, if your camera allows it like mine, you set it up on its continuous shooting and hope that at least one, if not some of the pictures, have your subject in the part of the frame you want them to be in.

You know, I tried to find something bad about you. I honest to God tried. Meg never said a bad thing about you. I don’t know what was worse, her defending you or not defending you. She walked away from me more often than not. I thought she was delusional. I mean, look at me! I was available and interested and you -- weren’t.”

I don’t have a naturally optimistic personality. Sometime it can be exactly the complete opposite. (Did ya get that I’m not about to call myself a pessimist?) The funny thing is that a lot of the time while I’m going through something or in a certain phase of my life, I’ll be completely unhappy with it. I look over the fence at yards that I think are quite a bit greener than the one I’m standing in at the moment. The ironic part of all is once I’m out of that situation or phase of life I’ll miss it, and I’ll realize it wasn’t as bad as I thought; and somehow in my messed up mind that phase or situation that I was so unhappy in now looks like the yard with the greener grass.
Hope everyone has a wonderful week. I am looking forward to having a sit down and catching up on all that you have been doing!!

Okay, enough house stuff...I did actually steal away a few hours yesterday to make this card for my sister's boss. She had originally requested a Ninja themed Easter card. Yeah, I know, a little difficult to round up images for that, so I opted for this wonderful digi image called Karate Boy from Mo's Digital Pencil. While I was perusing Mo's site, I ended up plopping 6 other images in my cart by accident (yeah, right...accident my tuches)! I couldn't resist. Hopefully I will find some time to play with them in the next few weeks. Oh, and do you want to know what I received in return for this card? 3 dozen fresh chicken and duck eggs! Yep, that's a pretty fine trade, if you ask me ;D Love this bartering stuff. We should totally go back to that way of life.

Sanchez is both more earthy and more practical. One perfume will enable you to 'fake hygiene when your plumbing's on the fritz'. A forgettable Guerlain resembles 'that whoosh that comes out of the dryer when I open the door'. When you're on the New York sidewalk in a heatwave and 'good and bad smells... nearly comb your hair as they rake past', what you want is 'Bulgari Pour Femme, wafting up from your cleavage'. Lush's Superworldunknown makes her feel 'giddy disbelief, as if Venus were suddenly emerging from a Manila trash heap'.

I had been cooking brown rice for a number of years, but was never thrilled about having brown rice for dinner. I suffered through it, because I knew it was good for me. But, on a whim one day a few years ago, I picked up the The Best Light Recipe from the folks at Cook’s Illustrated and I tried their brown rice recipe. I do have to say, this is PERFECT. I love eating brown rice now. Each grain is separate and cooked just right–soft, but just a little, bit chewy. And, by baking in the oven with a savory liquid, each grain of rice absorbs so much flavor. I’ve adapted the recipe over time and I use different broths and aromatics depending on what I have on hand. This is also doubled from the original recipe.
As a company that was established long before the advent of the digital watch, Hamilton prefers mechanical or automatic movements.

Along the way, there was James to be heard! Thanks to our great friend, Mary Gold, I got to go see him in concert once again. This time we were able to attend a few of the concerts together with a few friends in tow. Shirts were made and worn, laughter was had, band members were talked to, and we were able to see each other and have a great time getting to know each other just a little bit more. Totally fun. The first concert we saw was in Portland. We then drove up to Seattle area to see the one there. After that we crashed at Ronnie's house and stayed a few days. Ronnie hosted an intro to unschooling panel, for which I sat on. I was honored to be there and we did have a good time. After that we headed home completely exhausted beyond what we had anticipated.

Anyhoo, I knew she was nominated for a South Bank Sky Arts Award for best album, along with Adele and PJ Harvey, but I never dreamed for a moment that even if she'd won she'd actually turn up. But turn up she did. I didn't see her arrive, but when Tom Jones announced she'd won she had to come all the way up through the room from the very back, and seeing as my table was just at the foot of the stage by the only steps up, she had to brush right past me. I was but feet away. I resisted the urge to touch her or shout out how much I love her - I'm a fortysomething year-old man, after all - and I'm very rarely starstruck, but that was one of those moments.
Yes, and no. We can control it by preparing for that first meeting. If we do, the first impression will be more stable and likely more positive. However, Geoffrey James cites that there isn’t a logical thought process which individuals experience. Truth is, it’s a reaction both immediate and unconscious. Many sources detail how to form a positive first impression, but they want you to ACT LIKE SOMETHING YOU AREN’T!

Even the very smallest thing that we allow in our lives that is not under the control of the Holy Spirit is completely sufficient to account for spiritual confusion, and spending all of our time thinking about it will still never make it clear. Spiritual confusion can only be conquered through obedience. As soon as we obey, we have discernment. This is humiliating; because when we are confused we know that the reason lies in the uncertain state of our mind. But when our natural power of sight is devoted and submitted in obedience to the Holy Spirit, it becomes the very power by which we perceive God’s will, and our entire life is kept in simplicity.

I enjoy Spring because it is a step away from cold days. We spend more time outside in the sun, no longer wishing to huddle inside where it is warm. Outside we hear more laughter, we see more beauty, and people are more approachable. I enjoy the warming sun on my skin, the fragrant blossoms, and the scent of freshly mown lawn. I haul out my short-sleeved t-shirts, my shorts and my scandals. I make the most of the longer days by spending time outside with my family at the park, visiting the city, or even walking outside in the streets. I savour every Spring day until the temperatures get too high and we cool ourselves down in our homes until the heat of the day has passed.

Mythological Mondays is a feature I created to spotlight books brimming with--you guessed it--mythology! I adore this sub-genre and can't wait to share my love with all of my fellow bookworms! This feature isn't just focused on novel reviews; it may also include interviews, looks at original mythological tales, etc. Please feel free to do this with me! If you guys ever do a mythological feature and want to join this and snag my lovely mermaid, I would LOVE to see the feature. Leave a comment for us all to see! It doesn’t have to be Greek mythology, or even mythology per say. It can be mermaids, unicorns, or heck, even fairy tales (because I’m too lazy to do a separate fairy tale feature…). It doesn’t even have to be every Monday. I’m sure there will be Mondays when I skip, too!

While your socca bakes, saute yellow and red onion over medium-low heat, until they begin to brown. If they start to stick a lot, reduce the heat and add a couple of tablespoons of water. Let them saute for about 20 minutes, add Portobello mushrooms, and saute until some of the water cooks out. The longer you cook the onions, the more the sugars begin to breakdown, making the onions a deep caramel color. Overall, this whole process took about 30 minutes for me. But you could probably get away with 20 minutes and still get the caramelization.

As for blogging, you're reading it. I'm sitting at Block 15 right now having a pint of Alpha IPA on cask and a very nice cilantro and pepper oriented Southwest Salad. I'm also thinking about how I'm not really a businessman and about how I need to get out more often. This is all a good thing. I sometimes forget who I am, and am often reminded by friendly patrons that I'm looking a little harried, with bouts of pale and wan.

This is why we must really understand our voice and develop it accordingly. I LOVE thrillers, but I’m naturally a humor author. I find that I might love reading thrillers, but I’ve had a tough time writing them. I get far too sidetracked with comedy that isn’t appropriate. Thrillers are not a natural fit with my writing voice.

In The Last Ringbearer, the victorious elves still leave, but for quite a different reason. Their victory contains their defeat, and it is the achievement of snatching ultimate victory from the jaws of apparent destruction that occupies us during The Last Ringbearer. I won’t give away how this works out — “spoilers” are called that for good reason.

It is unclear when Jesus was born. Matthew says it was when Herod was King while Luke says it was when Cyrenius was Governor. The problem is that Herod died 10 years before Cyrenius became Governor. It was supposedly in Bethlehem were Mary and Joseph had to go as part of a census. There is no evidence that the census described took place. Roman censuses were concerned only with citizens (people born in Italy) and none required you to return to your ancestral home (a ridiculous notion that would have unnecessarily complicated the already complex task of running a census). Herod supposedly massacred all the infants when he heard about Jesus, surely that is the kind of thing that would get noticed and commented upon? But there is no recording of this alleged incident anywhere outside the Bible.
I finished with a time of 21:20. In this race that was good enough for 4th in my age group. I take that in stride this time though as the guy that was 3rd was 25 seconds ahead of me and the #1 place was a guy in my age that finished in like 17:30!!! The 2nd place guy in my age was also under 20 minutes. When you are Batman, and you are racing against Barry Allen and Wally West (two of the people that have been The Flash) that come 1 & 2, 4th place is none too shabby. I was the 9th male and the 12th racer overall.
The SCSO and Siskiyou County Animal Control responded to a report on March 31 that horses were reportedly in distress and not being properly cared for after being observed in a small field on Obsidian Road in the Big Springs area.

Tom Manney, the manager of Black Self Help, and Dwight Stallings were also arrested but released, for lack of evidence. I have not been able to determine the names of the other two suspects who were released. For some peculiar reason, Howard refers to one by the pseudonym, “Jasper Childs.” All but one of the arrestees worked for the black Moslem business, Self Help Moving and Storage; Cooks worked for the Black Muslim-owned, Shabazz Bakery.

Some of us out there will play Black Ops 2 for its brand spanking new remote-controlled Quad-rotor drones, others for the thrill of shaping a Call of Duty campaign for the very first time. Some will come for crazy horseback pursuits under fire, others for the experience of fighting, then wirelessly commandeering a gigantic four-legged tank. But the real fans, the ones who’ve stuck with the COD series since the beginning understood what sets Treyarch apart from Infinity Ward, will come for the zombies. And they won’t leave disappointed.

A few years back I was having a business dinner in Germany with a rising star of a company where I was facilitating a leadership development program. We were very similar in age, family status, etc. It was unsettling to think that if we lived closer to each other we could have probably been good friends and if we’d been born a few generations prior we would have been blood enemies. Divisions of arbitrary geography.
What will I be drinking myself? Well, I'll probably go to the Auld Shillelagh on Stoke Newington Church Street and fight my way to the bar in what is normally a quiet Irish pub, and have a couple of the best pints of Guinness in North London. I might come home early and open the bottle of Otley porter I was sent for St David's Day, or the stunning Imperial Stout that debuted the Meantime College Beer Club, or the Quantock Brewery Stout that won bronze in SIBA's national bottled beer competition and turned up on my doorstep yesterday. It doesn't matter. I'll be drinking dark beer because that's what you do on St Patrick's Day. It's what everyone does.

The work mentioned here covers American patent litigation which is both important and more easily analysed due to the availability of data. The general conclusions of patent analysis should also be true for other IPR and other countries. However, Hoti et al argue that, unlike patents, trade mark litigation is likely cyclical and peaked in 2000. As mentioned previously, very little evidence exists for copyright, design rights and trade secret litigation. Economic analysis of non-American IP litigation is uncommon. Chief Economist of the European Patent Office Nikolaus Thumm notes that European litigation of patent infringement is relatively rare in comparison to the U.S.

I knew long ago that I really wanted some kind of flowering tree in the baby's room. My original plan was just to paint it by hand onto the wall above the Trellis. Then I started second guessing myself about the whole thing. What if I love it in my mind right now, but after baby comes and my hormones have settled a little I end up hating it?! Then I have to sand out the wall so I can repaint. Didn't sound like much fun to me. I even thought about doing something in vinyl, but really wanted a more textured look.

The advert presents images from across the country, its festivities, party, natural wonders, activities to do in the beach. Such images are enticing to anyone to simply let go of worries and stresses, and just have fun while going around the Philipines. Atop these, the element of humor was wittingly applied. The technicalities of the video editing was simple ending it with “what else to see?”. The music was upbeat but not irritating to the ear. Overall, it was an awesome advertisement to boost Philippine tourism.

I’m not saying it can’t happen – bloody hell, Megan is a monster – I’m just saying it’s not expected, all right? I’m not sexist. Megan’d eat me alive if I was.

In a BYOD environment, companies must balance corporate needs, such as compliance with HIPPA and PCI DSS, with employee expectations of privacy and independence. A new generational technology divide has emerged in the workplace. Early Blackberry users were given the company owned device by their employer. Although the device may have been used for some personal calls or email, it was clearly a corporate asset. Today, new employees have been using a smart phone for years. Younger employees expect to control their own device. These same employees would be horrified to learn that many current acceptable use policies (AUP) give employers virtually all control over a device. With changing employee expectations, organizations will be compelled to adapt the way they manage mobile devices.

﻿Today, surprisingly, was a good day; bitter-sweet, but good. I was able to enjoy myself, reflect and feel the flow of love going in and out of my heart. I spent a good amount of time at the cemetery today. And during my earlier visit I journaled. I could have sat there all day. The sense of clarity I felt today was comforting and I realized today, that I am a good mother to both my children. The following were my thoughts as they flowed from my heart to my pen.

A few weeks ago I was asked by Tabitha Alterman, the Mother Earth News and Natural Home & Garden food and gardening editor, to write a blog for their website. So, I asked myself if I had the time or motivation to do two blogs, and decided that I didn't. But ... I'm doing it anyway!
I cut back on my serving sizes, especially when it came to the home-made meals. Instead of three or four heaping spoonfuls of mashed potatoes, just one semi-hefty one. Instead of eating until I feel I will burst or have a coronary episode, I ate until I was almost full, then rested my fork for a bit. I stopped eating handfuls of jelly beans to help my night-time pills go down. I drank a little more water, and took the stairs an extra time or two.

I was born in Mexico but raised in California. The dark fantasy has always attracted me even though as I grew up I was never able to find a good balanced one to my likes. It was not until I was a sophomore at UCR that I was able to meet up with a friend who introduced me into the world of D&D. It was Raistlin that would drive my thoughts into creating a world based on magic that was more this world than one which is lost to the annals of time. I have always loved writing and even though I tend to jump the gun I find that my stories are character based and charged with a lot of emotion. I have been told that a writer should not let their emotions enter into a characters line or who that character is to be. I think that is wrong.
Anyway, the next batch was not nearly as lucky. I had my AR-15. Again feeding in a wet-weather pond, this group was caught in the open. We slipped to about 75-80 yards away. The other four saddled up next to a palm, I fanned out to edge of the action. Somebody shot and the hogs scattered like quail, with three or four sows – I lost count in the action – spinning my way and into the Teeth of the Beast.

Yet whatever one may think about that man (and trust me, I have), the fact remains that somewhere under the sexism is a real and legitimate point. War may at times seem a world of almost masonic mystery where women shouldn’t tread – but how would women feel if a man wrote a novel set in a community of nuns? War is different. There is a kind of unique brotherhood forged between men who stand under fire together, who face death and privation, who have to maim and to kill and stay sane. There is a kind of comradeship very different from that normally enjoyed by women, and if I can’t even acknowledge it then how on earth can I write about it? I do acknowledge it, I’ve talked extensively to modern day veterans to attempt to understand it – but why should I even try?
After all the hype has subsided about Avatar changing the way we look at movies, I'm finding that I can't really muster up much of interest to say about the movie. It is what it is—a bloated and self-important but undeniably amazing technical achievement—and you either accept the whole package, warts and all, or dismiss it all as so much expensive self-indulgence. I was able to accept the whole package, at least for about two hours, before Cameron, guns blazing and bombastic speeches soaring, started to bore me in its lengthy and noisy climactic battle sequence, bringing back bad memories of the soulless wall-to-wall action spectacle that sunk The Matrix Revolutions—part of another bloated, self-important and technically amazing pop epic about imaginary worlds clashing with reality—years ago.
Now, unlike in those fancy television shows, big films and books, when you happen upon a fight - it actually hurts! You have a few minutes of adrenalin pumping madly through you though, and this quite temporary state of being hides the pain until an hour or so later. But in my case at least, it gives me mind a much needed chance to clear...

3. Lack of Awareness. One thing that pretty much all the candidates – regardless of political hue – seem to share is their apparent blissful ignorance of the issues that preoccupy Londoners on a daily basis and which, if addressed, could make a real difference to the quality of life for millions of people. Twenty-four percent of Londoners would like to use a bike but refrain from doing so out of fear of getting squashed to death, yet we have heard no proposal for a Copenhagen-style network of segregated bikeways; vast swathes of the city are architecturally and socially conducive to riots, but the need for redeveloping these areas is scarcely touched on; and in an era where re-shoring is beginning to enter the economic lexicon, any initiatives to make London a hub for light industrial manufacturing capacity (and less reliant on the volatile and largely insolvent financial services sector) have passed us by. Roll on 2016?

What kind of article would this be if I didnt write about my favorite team? The issue with the Mets is pitching. The New York Mets’ official website has made it very clear that GM Sandy Alderson wants to resign Reyes. The fact that that is one of our team’s headlines alone is pathetic. The fact that Alderson wants Reyes back is less pathetic, but still pretty low. Here’s the order I see these things in:

In denying his right to free speech, the Supreme Court said, essentially, that you can say anything you want, as long as it isn’t something the government doesn’t want you to say. This is the gist of it, and I could be accused of bias in phrasing it this way. So I’ll just let Oliver Wendell Holmes speak for himself:

However, having access to European television is a good means to spy on what UK and American celebs are doing to earn a living off-season. Rock 'n' roll stars would not like their home public to know about the sort of naff gigs they do to pay the rent on the mock tudor mansion and the stays at the rehab clinic. Secrecy is the new celebrity. Wikileaks, phone hacking, no wonder they're all taking out super injunctions.

The repercussions also extend to democracy and public safety. Without identification, a significant portion of the population cannot vote or be elected to public office. Further, they are far more vulnerable to practices such as human trafficking and child prostitution. Without official proof of age they may also be at risk for child labor and early marriage. And more generally, without identification the government at every level cannot keep track of this population, or take precautions to ensure their safety. And, when parents are stateless, they are far more likely to pass this status down to their children, since identification is required to register birth and paternity in many cases.

I did really think this would get easier this week. For the last 16 weeks, I've increased my run time every week or two which has kept things really hard. Once I hit 45 minutes straight, I really believed 30 minute would be semi-easy. Not easy like no-big-deal-easy, but I was certainly not worried about not making it. I am a little thrown by this turn of events so I'll see what happens in the next few runs. I guess when I think back to the beginning of this and the big jumps in time I did, it did take a few weeks of runs to "get used" to the run. And everyone I talk to who runs says that the first mile is always hard. So maybe 3 miles will never get easier.

Now the Attorney General or somebody needs to go back through the 2,000+ cases in which Pikett testified and determine how many convictions were based primarily on his dogs' testimony.

The plot is loosely based on the Bosnian War which raged in the ’90’s. Some of the connections are laughably. The actual peace agreement ending the war was called the Dayton Accord. I the movie, it is the Cincinnati Accord. Why thecae? Your guess is as good as mine. The similarities between Owen Wilson’s character’s (Chris Bennett) plight and that of Scott O’Grady, an American pilot shot down over Bosnia in 1995 and survived for six days before being rescued, wee enough to prompt O’Grady to sue the producers for defamation. He probably just did no want to be associated with this dud.

I’ve always wondered if my ancestors were in the American Civil War. Until about two years ago (around the time I started this literature blog, actually), I didn’t know anything about my roots beyond my parents and their parents. My great-grandparents were a dusty memory I knew little about. Now I know my cousins fought for Atlanta, and that it’s very likely my great-great grandfather was fighting for the Confederacy the day Sherman came through Georgia. I know my ancestors have been in America since the 1600s — the Jamestown settlement on one side, into North Carolina in the 1700s and Georgia by 1832; and the Massachusetts Bay Colony on the other side, migrating into Concord, Massachusetts in the 1700s. (One of my ancestors was hung in Boston.) My mom always thought we were Irish (as did her mother, and her grandmother, I think.) She said she’d always heard (or surmised perhaps) that we came to America with the potato famine in the 19th century. It turns out family lore was way off. I came from Scotland in 1611! One thing I really, really want to know now is whether or not my family fought in the American Revolution.

I was able to get the last clothes line pole out of the yard, that I had left standing for the entire three years we have lived in this house. It was actually much easier to remove than the other one, which is just ironic now. The last one must have had a foot wide block of concrete on it, this one was like two inches. I guess I did the hard one first. Jenn and I were also able to drag the goat house across the yard, and put it in the corner where it will be sheltered.

Singing acts are a good choice for corporate entertainment. Song, like laughter, is a shared experience. We all know songs, and a group singing familiar songs will bring the audience together smiling. Song also touches emotion and memory. Evoking emotion will make the event more memorable, and enjoyable. Circus acts are available for corporate events. There are also jugglers and ventriloquists.

Anyhoo, he propped the thing up on an amp while we spent a pleasantly unproductive afternoon busking old songs that none of us could really remember and songs that none of us actually knew … pretty much par for the course.
I sometimes toast the quinoa first, then bring to boil in seasoned water or a water/broth mixture, and simmer until water is absorbed (like rice).
I hestitated before deciding to write about a book published in Australia, but now that we are all connected by Facebook, twitter and so forth, it ought to be the work of moments to acquire it if you should wish to do so. Which is why, yet again, I’m writing about Cassandra Golds, whose magnificent THE MUSEUM OF MARY CHILD I reviewed last year. It still saddens me that she’s not published in the UK. Any publishers reading this are advised to order her books and give them some consideration. She’s a most extraordinary writer and also one of those rare creatures who really does march to the beat of her own drummer. Her books are quite unlike anyone else’s and it’s this quality of being completely unusual that makes her work so appealing. Some British readers might remember her ‘CLAIR DE LUNE’ which has in it, in addition to much else, a mouse who sets up a ballet school. This mouse interacts with the human heroine and in her latest novel, Golds goes back to the mouse/human combination which was so well done in the earlier book.

April:Treasury Secretary John Snow repeats his call for GSE reform, saying “Events that have transpired since I testified before this Committee in 2003 reinforce concerns over the systemic risks posed by the GSEs and further highlight the need for real GSE reform to ensure that our housing finance system remains a strong and vibrant source of funding for expanding homeownership opportunities in America… Half-measures will only exacerbate the risks to our financial system.” (Secretary John W. Snow, “Testimony Before The U.S. House Financial Services Committee,” 4/13/05)

Now it would be one thing if the difference between Afrikaner & Boer was just semantics (as one guest erroneously & ignorantly put it) being different terms referring to the same people. This could even be true to an extent vis a vis those Boers or Boer descendants who also refer to themselves as Afrikaners -due to conditioning- but the fact of the matter is that most Afrikaners are of Cape Dutch descent since people of Boer descent compromise only about not much more than a third of the total White Afrikaans speaking population.

Before you even start it’s important to have a goal, to have that big dream where you are a successful entrepreneur. You will no doubt face set backs along the way, so having the big dream will give you something to focus on. Initially a dream might be all that it is, but at some point it will be necessary to come up with that all important business idea. Spotting an opportunity be it a gap in the market, a new invention, a new work practice is what being an entrepreneur is all about. You always need to be thinking about where to go next and what could be the next big thing. Being innovative, being the leader in your field will ensure you’re always one step ahead of your competitors.

B and I ate most of the prunes straight from the bag across that week and on the long train ride back north, a thoughtful chew and an archaic smile their only condiment. But once back in London I wanted to make a prunes and custard dish that both redeemed and paid homage to the ridiculed genre of prunishness. I began with the idea of a clafoutis – a simple French dish of baked custard and fruit. The name of this dish might, some think, find its origin in the word meaning “to fill up, to stuff.” But other sources suggest a root meaning “to affix with nails.” Since clafoutis is most commonly made with cherries which film over with a skin of custard and bleed slightly as they cook, I’m convinced of the latter meaning – surely the dish acquired its name because it looks like stigmata? But mine would be made with prunes, and there is a Breton version of the clafoutis, slightly sturdier in consistency, made with prunes. It is called a “far Breton.” I decided to follow a “far” recipe, but borrow a little something from the clafoutis, too. In a clafoutis, it is traditional to leave the stones in the cherries, to impart a hint of almond flavour to the pudding. I thought I could mimic this, and get something of a brothelly “to stuff” meaning in my prunes – by removing their pits and replacing them with a nub of marzipan. In Far Breton and similar dishes, the prunes are sometimes soaked in tea or Armagnac to plump them up. My prunes had no need of such hydration, but it would be a shame to spurn spirits altogether, especially since I had taken care to procure a small bottle of Prune D’Ente eau de vie from the Sarlat market. So I added a generous tablespoon to my batter.
Unfortunately I am not referring to a suicide that took place 12 years ago. On June 19th, a beautiful 12 year old girl that is a part of my extended family, succumbed to the injuries she suffered days earlier, when she hung herself and her mother found her unconscious and nearly dead. This has hit me on so many levels and I can't seem to push through it.
I first 'met' Sally back in 2004 when I sent her a submission for the literary short story magazine Quality Women's Fiction, where she was commissioning editor. She read, liked, and sent it on to Jo Derrick (then Jo Good) who also liked - and that was my very first print publication. I was so proud. And eternally grateful! Sally is author of a novella called Chasing Angels, and a novel, 'Hope on Hope' (Myrmidon), which was longlisted for the 2011 Romantic Novel of the year.

By the way, the place I'm training at, Vertical Aviation in Lebanon, OH, uses Enstrom F28's for training. The big difference between Enstroms and the more common Robinsons or Hughes 300's is no governor. You see, Robinsons and Hughes both have engine governors that keep the engine rpm's in the green for any given collective setting. Not the Enstroms. You change collective, you adjust throttle, and vice verse. You move the pedals, you adjust the throttle, you move the collective and vice verse. You move the cyclic... well, you get the idea. So, I actually set out and made learning helicopters harder than I could have.
Butter and flour a round pan with diameter between 27cm and 30cm. On the bottom of the pan, after the flouring it, put parchment paper as well. It helps unmold the cake more easily. Empty the batter to the pan. Sink a coin, very well cleaned and wrapped in an aluminum foil, inside the batter and bake for 1 hour to 1 hour and 10 minutes depending on the oven. It is done when you put a knife in the center and it comes out clear.

Although undoubtedly the smoking ban has put many smokers off visiting pubs, and made others visit less often, surveys have shown that smokers are still more likely to visit pubs than non-smokers, so it stands to reason that pubs should do what they can within the law to accommodate them. If you are a smoker, it is very clear which pubs extend a welcome to you, and which can’t be bothered, and that is obviously likely to influence where you take your custom, and indeed that of your non-smoking friends as well.
NCDC now has December 2008 in the database. Annual North American temperature since 1998 (11 years of data) is falling over the period at a rate of 0.78(F)/decade or 7.8(F)per century.

Although I dreaded it at first, I’m glad that I was forced to watch the movie. I would have missed out on a great gem otherwise.
Last week I went to visit my boyfriend to a country beginning with ‘It’. Don’t ask me how I have a boyfriend, I don’t really know. If it were not for him having pestered me for weeks, I would still be alone! I was too scared to start a relationship with him. What if I didn’t kiss properly and he laughed at me and then left me? What if I didn’t smell nice? What if he just hated me and was saying it as a joke just to be mean? (Yes, these are the real things that go through my head at moments like these). So, anyway, we were in this country and he told me we must dine with his granddad. This is already quite tricky for me since I never know what to talk about with him (or anyone, for that matter). The good thing is, I am able to use the language boundary as an excuse. Actually, I understand everything he says, but I haven’t learnt to speak their language yet for two main reasons:

We arrived at Lourghn, my first home, the great city that it now is was only a small town when I was born in it. In the center of it stands the statue of Aridios “Ironblade” Airstrider, my best friend, may he rest in peace. He’s honored as the greatest human hero to have been born ever, and he was even if they embellished his history a bit. If it wasn’t for his bravery and kindness and his ability to unite people under a belief, most of the places that exist now would never have existed.

And then came The Talk Show. When MJ was two months old and cousin Chelsea was a newborn, my sister-in-law, Denise, and I were having a little visit, each with infant in arms. The TV was on in the background, and some talk show came on. The topic of the day was teenage girls who hate their mothers. We listened to the venom spewing out of the mouths of those girls and their moms, looked from the TV set to our sleeping cherubs, and then looked at each other in horror. Ohmigod, is that what's in store for us?

I have heard people mention burners and wax tarts alot over the past few weeks so I cheekily asked my mum to try to pick me up a burner when she went shopping last week. she managed to find me a small burner and a couple of Yankee tarts and dropped them off that evening. I had never used a burner before and as it was so small I knew without a doubt that a full tart wouldn’t fit so I cut it into quarters and used a small quarter in the top of the burner. the room was immediately filled with a sickly flowery scent of lilacs( Lilac Blossoms)which after only a few minutes started to cause a headache. I was disappointed but thought that as I don’t particularly like floral scents I should try to find a scent which would agree with me more and had a quick search online. I came across yankeedoodle and this is where I first heard about Kringle candles. I was surprised to read that the creator of Yankee candles is the father of Mike Kittredge III who is the creator of Kringle candles

And finally, Chef Stefano prepared a milk risotto with cherry parfait. For Hubby and I, the milk risotto was very similar to the British version of rice pudding that we love so this was a huge hit with us. Amongst all the recipes shared, I think this is one that many of you will be able to recreate at home, hence I will share the recipe in another post. The only thing you may not be able to do is make your cherry parfait in a Pacojet (well, unless you have one of this cool expensive machines already!). Pacojet is a cool machine which can make ice-cream and many other things in seconds! But you can always cheat and use vanilla ice cream out of a tub as it will do the trick.

Free Write. By far one of the easiest ways to get those creative juices flowing is to just start writing. Anything. It doesn't matter what it's about. Just grab a piece of paper and start writing whatever comes to your mind—don't over think, don't edit and most importantly don't stop. Just write. Sure, your finished project will probably be filled with a bunch of unusable junk, but you might just end up with a gem—or at least a few note worthy lines.

“O” and “K” were at one time teenage boyfriend-girlfriend but as usual that did not last, although they remained friends, even best of friends for many years.

I find a certain music in conservative writing that I never find in that of liberals. Michael Oakeshott speaks of "affection," "attachment," "familiarity," "happiness"; and my point is not the inane one that these are very nice things, but that Oakeshott thinks of them as considerations pertinent to political thinking. He knows what normal life is, what normal activities are, and his first thought is that politics should not disturb them....

Now remember, Tacitus refers to the Christians being persecuted by Nero in the 60′s AD, within 30 years of the death of Jesus. Josephus mentions Jesus in his Antiquities of the Jews, written around AD 94. The passages are disputed and almost certainly in part an interpolation, still most scholars believe they are, in part, genuine. The fact that there is no written mention of Mohammed 60 years after his death is suspicious.

Weakness: This is a five-man team. The Wildcats don’t get much offensive production from anyone outside of the players listed above. They account for 79.4 percent of Davidson’s offense, which means if one of them has an off night; the team is really in the bind. For Davidson to make some noise it’ll need someone else to give an offensive boost.
This picture is very deceiving. That little log in the background actually has a diameter of over four feet at the base. When the waves came crashing in, they would pick that log up like it was a bath toy and roll it around, and twist it in different directions. This is why it is so important to stay far away from logs in the surf. A wave can pick it up and put it on top of you in a heart beat! And waves can really take you by surprise -- just a couple of minutes after this picture was taken a wave crashed right where I was standing to get this shot. Aslan (the dog) and I bolted up the cliff, barely escaping a good soaking!

There is an immediate aporia that arises with Kant’s assertion that objects of experience are ‘in’ space and time. It has to do with language; specifically the use of the preposition ‘in’. It might be that Kant was merely running up against the limits of language. But nevertheless, the point remains that his choice to employ a spatial metaphor has far-reaching implications, whether intended or not.

I was bailed out by a Mr. David Hargrave, whom I’ve never met. David is the brother of Daniel Hargrave, a family friend for many years, a staunch Texan and one of the best human beings I’ve ever eaten In ‘n Out with (there are literally thousands of human beings I’ve eaten In ‘n Out with, and Daniel is in the .001 percentile which, due to my math skills, might actually make him into a fractional person but whatever). The loose network of support I call my Mobile Ozone Layer began to branch out into the dark corners of the bail bond universe and, from all the way by LAX in Los Angeles, a spark was set forth that would eventually become the all-mighty raging inferno of a miracle personified by David when he drove, from Houston on the way to Fort Worth, to pick my ass up from County.
A.: I teach literature and composition at both the high school and university level. I love my job and can’t even imagine doing anything else.

As one of eight children, I am surrounded by family. I am also blessed with a supportive and beautiful wife and three sons of whom I am more proud than anything I have ever done in my life and career.

Shaman should not be confused with Medicine men or Medicine women. Medicine people are those who serve as prophets, soothsayers and moral leaders. They are often the tribal storytellers and their services were considered healing. The French called them me'decins or doctors. From this the word medicine became applicable to everything pertaining to these people as well as to anything the Natives held sacred.

The problem with the answers from Congressman Gingrich and Governor Romney is that, well, they didn’t always say what they’re saying. Governor Romney was the author of Romneycare, which is a top- down government-run health care system which, read an article today, has 15 different items directly in common with Obamacare, everything from the increase in the Medicaid program, not just that government is going to mandate you buy something that’s a condition of breathing, mandate that you buy an insurance policy, something that Governor Romney agreed to at the state level, something Congressman Gingrich for 20 years advocated, that the federal government can force each and every person to enter into a private contract. Something that everyone now, at least up on this stage, says is radically unconstitutional, Congressman Gingrich supported for 20 years.

An online environment, by nature, lacks the cues to inform our sense of circumstance and company, and, as a result, the internet gives us permission to say whatever comes into our minds at a given moment, without reflection, without concern for how others might feel or react. What we experience online, then, is essentially the inner monologues of unrestrained and discourteous children. For a given discussion, a participant can throw an intellectual stink bomb into a room, then run away and never deal with the consequences. After all, all that you require to be a participant is a keyboard, but nothing else. And hence the rules of courtesy, of discourse, of discussion, of propriety, and even of human kindness become disposable in the online environment. The problem of split personality, then, is a problem of maturity.

Since I only had a standard piggy cookie cutter of a pig from the side-view, I asked my hubby to make me another custom cookie cutter. But instead of making it from a soda can like he did the last time, he bought special thin sheets of copper, specifically meant for things like cookie cutters. Awesome! All I had to do was draw him an outline of the piggy, and he did the rest.
then one day. it happened. i was in the next room when all of the sudden i heard a cry. a pained, panicked, anguished cry. i ran in to find...eggie. in pieces. first thought? disease. luckily eggie broke on a placemat so just ran that over to the sink. as my daughter sobbed and screamed "he's gone! he's gone!" i scrubbed her hands. then we sat down. at that point, i noticed the 4-year-old had tears streaming down his face. "oh eggie! poor eggie!" he sobbed. i held the two of them on my lap, both inconsolable.

So do you remember when I talked about how Mister Man's teacher didn't do the best job correcting his math homework? I let it go because Mister Man needs to learn that people in authority aren't always right, and really... in the grand scheme of things, it isn't that big a deal. He was fine with it, and I chalked it up to a bad teacher book, though it wasn't the first time it happened.
“As of today (March 16), UC Davis police had forwarded six cases to the Yolo County district attorney’s office, recommending prosecution for violating Penal Code sections that make it a misdemeanor to ‘willfully and maliciously’ obstruct the free movement of any person on any street, sidewalk or other public place, or to intentionally interfere with any lawful business.
As the free for all week comes to an end, I would like to thank each designer that participated. I love when designer's take the skills that may have started out with simple crafting and combine them with other skills to create new and exciting projects.
It’s not that I have any wooden barrels around the place needing their bungs popped. Nah, it’s more mundane than that. Because mint juleps are nearly our house drink, we go through a fair amount of crushed ice. And if it’s not for a julep, crushed ice comes in handy for a variety of other drinks, not least of which is the Painkiller, a rum and fruit juice concoction that likely has caused as much pain as it supposedly relieved.
The Fiend Factory is back with only two pages of monsters. The odd "Tenser Beast" which is a monster of Tenser's Floating Disk. The Man Scorpion, which is not the same as other creatures I have seen like it. The Ogress, the offspring of a male ogre and a female human with some disguise ability. The Wrecker, a specialized Iron Golem and the Plant Man, which is part plant and part man, natch.

Instead of enjoying this skiing season for a very last time in the typical spring conditions (sun, sun, sun, getting a sunburn & lot of freckles), the Easter bunny had a much harder time to find me this year. Since Friday it was heavily snowing not letting me even try to do some skiing due to the fog that accompanied this ugly weather. That's why I feel like having gained 10 kg during the past three days (eating and ignoring the essay waiting for me are perfect substitutes) and slowly but surely I give up on hoping for any nice weather to come.
owing to a sudden surprise discovery in my bank account I decided to take my mate Mr H out for a pint after work. Here are the details of how that and the rest of a refreshing night panned out.

Alan Garner's The Owl Service was published in 1967, Paul Zindels' The Pigman and My Darling, My Hamburger a few years later. Peter Dickinson's Changes trilogy was from the same period, beginning in 1968; John Christopher's Tripods series began at the same time. And this was also the period when novels originally ostensibly for adults, like Lord of the Flies (1958) and Catcher in the Rye (1951) were being given to teenagers to read because of the age of their protagonists.

We arrived during social hour, which meant we got to partake in snacks before dinner. This is the ham and eggs. I hadn't messed with the camera yet. I just pulled it out and shot in auto mode. Keep in mind that there's almost no light where we were sitting.
And me? No, I’m not Nanette-like either. I have too much a hard time saying goodbye and cutting ties to be able to change boyfriends weekly or monthly or even regularly. Too bad. Ha-ha. Or is it?
As most of you know, I LOVE doing giveaways and sending my products to be reviewed by lots of different bloggers, large and small. If you look over at the giveaways tab I have 7 giveaways going on right now!! I try my best to send my products to blogs that I think will give a fair and thorough review of my products and take the time to give their honest opinion, not just someone who is out for free stuff and who will copy and paste stuff from my website and then do a giveaway. When I send things out for review, I never send just a diaper, or just a box of wipes. I usually send a whole selection of products so that I can get different viewpoints on a variety of my stuff from lots of different people.

I didn’t read Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer on vacation, nor would I recommend it, but I did read it last month. It’s a very easy read and a fascinating story that just happens to be true. It’s just not very light, though, seeing as it’s about a guy who walks off into the Alaska wilderness and starves to death there.
This booklet also shows how the indigenous people of Britain are fully protected by the United Nations Charter on Indigenous Peoples from “dispossession of their territory” through “mass population transfers” and from “forced integration and assimilation” and “destruction of their identity and culture” (all according to the United Nations).
I'm still hunting everywhere I can think of to find upcycle worthy stuff to play with, but I think I might be waiting for those until yard sales start popping up.

I’ve always been a huge supporter of journaling and reflecting on my day-to-day life, not only to sort out the troubling times but also to keep those exciting, adrenaline rush memories alive. And, most importantly, to get to those ‘AHA!’ moments; because, if you write just to write, whatever you are feeling, without judgment, and with the expectation that not even you will be reading what ends up on the page, you WILL get an ‘AHA!’ moment.
Just get me through the next four hours, mind, and we can spend the next week writing gibberish and frivolous stuff like stories about hipster aliens who are trying to take over the world.

Recently there has been a lot of talk on the new gen’s hardware, with rumours of the Durango needing a constant internet connection and the Orbis’ new processors. I’m more interested in the software and other support. Below is what I have wanted the game market place to look like for a good few years now. It shows a mock up page on Xbox’s new market place (based on Kickstarter). Halo 4 is being used as an example and is split up into diffrent sections matchmaking, campaign, and spartan ops. Many people I know don’t wish to play the multiplayer, and many more can’t play online. The same can often be said for single player aspects of games. It took me a many years to get broadband after Xbox Live was first released. I also know that there are large areas that still don’t have the required broadband to run such services. Meaning paying for full price for a game that you may only get half the access to is just plain silly. Games like Call of Duty are very multiplayer centric, and on the other hand Mass Effect 3 the single player takes the leading role. Since I noticed online market places have been growing I always expected a game to be put up in different sections. For the past few years I was expecting an anouncment on a leading title like Call of Duty saying that they have thought of a new way to sell their product.

Here's a look at both the left and right pages with the inserts removed:
They say a good night’s sleep really affects your mood for the rest of the day. How many times have you woken up grumpy and sore because you’re feeling stiff and tight in your muscles like an old man? Good quality mattresses are important to support your spine when you sleep as well as pillows that support your neck. Again you want to restore the natural curves of your spine so you don’t want a pillow that is too soft or a mattress that sags in the lower back giving you no support there!
These are details that become so familiar in your day to day life that you can forget they exist. Like cracks in a sidewalk you use every day, you can step right over them without even seeing them.

There are a LOT more images, though - Lee & Low have fully appreciated my love for Teh Cover Chat. They blogged the entire process - the images their artist drew, and the whole process of selection for their final image. I LOVE the one which reminds me of a WICKED poster, and the Death on Duty as lifeguard is very near perfect - but I appreciate much the design team's assessments that they needed to reflect some Roma ethnicity into the cover. The final model is very nearly perfect, and reminds me of my friend Axel, who is Romanian - and gets a lot of the same static about being olive-skinned and Eastern European as Roma do.
And a note to add:
As for my design, it was my intent to keep it classically simple. I didn't want to take away from the purpose of the card - to Thank all my guests for making my 50th a memorable day.

The most bizarre and perverted aspect of this phenomenon of self-hatred is the denial of the Holocaust itself.

Previously owned by Carolyn Waters, State Of Play had eight starts for trainer Paul Webber, winning a Ludlow bumper and a Hereford novice hurdle before being sold for 18,000 guineas at Doncaster Sales in August, 2005. He made an impressive winning debut for his new trainer Evan Williams that October when taking a novice chase at Chepstow and followed up with a comfortable success in a similar contest at Plumpton six weeks later. He was then pitched into Grade One company for the Feltham Novices’ Chase but struggled against some top-quality opposition and was tailed off. Given a break, State Of Play returned to action in a handicap chase at Aintree’s John Smith’s Grand National meeting over the Mildmay fences, where he made a mockery of his official mark of 128 and was eased down to record a stunning 16-length victory. He surpassed that success on his next appearance, in the Hennessy Cognac Gold Cup at Newbury in November, 2006, keeping on well to beat Juveigneur by four lengths. Williams kept his star chaser fresh for an ambitious tilt at the Cheltenham Gold Cup and State Of Play ran a sound race to finish sixth, just over 11 lengths behind the victorious Kauto Star, before a tepid end to his season with fourth behind Exotic Dancer in the Grade Two Betfair Bowl at Aintree on the Mildmay course. State Of Play showed his preference for running fresh with a good second to Ollie Magern on his seasonal debut in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby in October, 2007, but the rest of that season proved a disappointment, with fifth to Denman in the Lexus Chase at Leopardstown’s Christmas meeting followed by sixth in the Letheby & Christopher Chase at Cheltenham at the end of January. A confidence-restoring return to handicap company also failed at Aintree in April as State Of Play could only beat one horse home. After a five-month break, he began the 2008/09 campaign with his first victory since his Hennessy triumph as he got the better of Ollie Magern in the Charlie Hall Chase at Wetherby in November. He returned to the Yorkshire course to contest the Rowland Meyrick Handicap Chase on December 26, when he came home fourth behind Nozic, Tidal Bay and Cloudy Lane. Rested until the John Smith’s Grand National in April, he ran a solid race to take fourth behind Mon Mome. He made just one appearance before returning to Aintree in April, 2010, pulling up behind Denman in the Hennessy Gold Cup at Newbury in November. The plan to keep him fresh paid dividends as State Of Play improved on his previous John Smith’s Grand National effort to take third behind Don’t Push It. State Of Play didn’t have a run last season until the John Smith’s Grand National and for the third year in succession he made the frame, running on strongly from the rear to take fourth. Trainer Evan Williams said he needs to train him like this because he is hard to keep sound and this year he will run in the Aintree showpiece for the fourth time. Since his first attempt in the John Smith’s Grand National in 2009, he has only visited the racecourse on three occasions.

My husband added some wood and brackets to the bottom of the piece as to raise it up a bit. At first he just added the brackets but soon found out wood was needed as well.

Janey's costume, pre-ears. We just used a headband set of ears for that, and the ability to put them through the costume was my last minute addition, at Janey's request (I want pink ears, mom! Not white ears, pink!). And yes, I did make this hoodie. Out of fleece. It's perfect for our cooler evenings, and for the days too, since Janey's been sick. Don't be surprised if you just see more of these showing up, sans-costume attachments. They're comfy, and simple.

The value of the IT contract has not been disclosed. Nor is it clear why NAMA is not using industry software to manage its portfolio. Nor is it clear why NAMA is just now awarding the contract given that the agency has supposedly been managing billions of euros of loans since last March/April 2010. And it is also not clear why NAMA is not using the same software as that used by Capita to manage the smaller value loans at the Participating Institutions.

He couldn’t come to rescue me either, not for another 40 minutes. As a last resort, I decided to ring our neighbours.

Nietzsche believes that this has helped the slave ressentiment to construct a belief “that the strong has the option of being weak…” He does not believe this to be true, anymore than he believes that “the bird of prey (can be) the lamb.” This believe (that the strong can choose to be weak) is then fundamental to the slave-morality. If exercising strength is a choice then those who do it can be held morally responsible for it. To extend his metaphor the birds of prey can be blamed for acting to their nature, for they could have chosen to be lambs.

When I get home I Google Pondosa. Turns out the only folks claiming the town is the center of the 50 US states are the couple who own the store. All other data points towards Butte County, South Dakota although apparently the exact geographical center depends on several variables (I'm not sure which). But I don't feel duped by Pondosa and I know that lovely couple truly believe it is the geographic center of the United States. Whether it is or not, Pondosa is still the middle of somewhere and I'd sip a hot cocoa with its warm-hearted two-person population any time.

Again the image is on bella's bestest cream paper (really it's the only paper I use) and coloured with her up with copics. I added some shading on her dress using pencils and gamsol. On her hair band and scallops on her dress I added some sparkle with crystal stickles. For the shading around her I used pencils and gamsol plus versa magic ink in both wheat and aspen mist. I added some glitter around her. Again the sentiment comes with the image and I sponged it with versa magic wheat.
I guess my main question is this: What will the future men of America be like when they are adults after a childhood of being coddled and Purexed to death? How tough will they be with no bumps and bruises and scars to help them remember growing up and being a boy? And will it even matter at that point, or will we have evolved enough to no longer need to be tough in our society?

Papaws on the other hand were men of wisdom. Having lived many more years on the earth, they knew how to do things and liked showing their grandchildren things. One was skilled at animal husbandry, caring for cattle, horses, cats, and could take wasps out of the house without killing them, letting them crawl on his finger without getting stung. The other was a mechanic, skillfully taking things apart, analyzing each part, and repairing, putting back together and bragging about how well things were made. The one would take us on walks to the pasture field, salt the cattle (by throwing salt on exposed rock “licks” and call the cattle to come partake), fix the fence, show us the creek, take us by the store for a “dope” and a piece of candy, and get us back in time for the ride home. The other would set up croquet in the back yard, show us how to play, keep us from going into the part of the basement where the secret “spirits” were kept, and fix our broken toys.

I paid a second visit to Baker Street Pub with my brother-in-law later in my stay and as we watched the Denver/Dallas football game I enjoyed a glass of the Baker Street Nut Brown ale, which smells a bit of maple or molasses and tastes great. This one would be too sweet to pound as a session beer. During the same stop I had a glass of Paulaner Hefeweizen, which arrived a cloudy light yellow color with no citrus attached per my instructions to the bartend-ress (who very kindly asked me if I wanted an orange or lemon). This hefe tastes vaguely of Hoegaarden but not as bad.

A couple of weeks ago in this post I mentioned I bought a tube of Cle de Peau full coverage stick concealer in the states when I was on holidays there in May. I had been wanting to purchase it for years after hearing celebrities and their makeup artists rant and rave about it but the hefty price tag ($70.00!) and the fact that I couldn't acquire it locally dissuaded me from taking the plunge. But, during my trip I came upon a Nordstrom's in Scottsdale and decided to suck it up and buy it to see what the hype was all about. Who cares if I couldn't go out for dinner and drinks that same night because I was now broke?? If it made my purply/dark under-eye circles completely disappear than it was DAMN WELL WORTH IT!!
The WIP will now begin with some kind of tarot thing in the background.
Very low on the list of the Roundmen’s priorities was solving murders, since there was usually no reward given for finding the killer. The only way a Roundsmen could make a profit going after murderers, was if the family of the victim posted a reward, and if the Roundsmen was lucky enough to catch the killer, which was very unusual, he would collect the reward, and a further stipend from the city for serving a legal summons on the perpetrator.

Would you feel better if they weren’t in your life? At all, or perhaps just not as often? I’ve certainly had people in my life that no matter how much I try to be positive and encouraging (even over the course of several years), they don’t want to get out of their funk. In this case, it’s been in my highest interest to distance myself and let go of certain relationships. It can be sad, but this is another way of setting healthy boundaries. You’re telling the Universe what type of people you want in your life, and what kind you don’t. Again, this does not make you a bad person. It makes you an empowered, loving, self-respecting person who knows what you want to attract into your life.

Framed and subdivided by the multi-pane window at one end of the loft was a view of the Los Angeles hills, where, on Friday evenings, fireworks popped behind an arc of evenly spaced palm trees that surrounded the baseball stadium. Moving closer, garment factories stood with their racks of bright materials and industrial spools of thread, the pale and bright fluorescent lights visible in suspended rows beneath concrete ceilings and water pipes. There was a smaller warehouse displaying in crisp black letters a sign that read SOUTHWESTERN BAG CO., and immediately below the window, a truck wash, which reflected the bright sun up into the loft, and with it the volleying sounds of lug wrenches and shouts.
And for the TMI Award…hmmm one of my most embarrassing moments. Well, it was like this. I was with my siblings and my mother in a fancy department store. We had just walked in and I was leaning over looking at some jewelry on a table. It had a mannequin leaning against the table…or so I thought. Well, said mannequin suddenly started to walk off. I, thinking I had knocked the mannequin over, lunged and grabbed him around the waist. You can imagine my embarrassment when I discovered that this mannequin was a real person. When I realized this, I released my hold and looked up at him and said “Oh, I am so sorry…I thought you were a dummy.” And when I looked around, my mother and siblings had all left me there.

Thank you to the overwhelming number of TSM readers for nominating the Occupy Movement for Hero of the Year! How I understand the Occupy Movement is that finally the 99% woke up and spoke truth to power–the absurd distribution of power and wealth in the United States must come to an end. Of course, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission certainly brought home the point that America was officially for sale. Extending the Bush tax cuts to the top 2% of Americans just added insult to injury. We can thank the Fecal Five for selling out America.

One broader use of patents observed particularly in chemical (apart from drugs) and other discrete product industries is their combination to build patent fences around some patented core invention. A second common use of patents which also goes beyond the licensing or commercialization is patenting to become or remain a major competitor (i.e., "player") in an industry, often via the amassing of large portfolios:

Well here at The Mambo we have a theory. A theory that brings us onto departing Barcelona Pep Guardiola and unsurprisingly, a theory that doesn’t cast our wonderful press in the sunniest of lights. Wenger, you see, like Guardiola is a foreigner and consequently his achievements pale when compared to our brave, British boys. True, Mourinho is no native to these islands but his arrogance and scheming transcended the usual jingoism, recalling as he did our very own Brian Clough. The response to a jaded Guardiola calling time on his glorious tenure at Barcelona was typical. Sadly, a moronic piece by James Lawton in The Telegraph accusing the Catalan of having ‘shirked football’s greatest test,’ a line sunk amongst a sea of daft drivel that largely implies Barcelona’s recent success was solely the result of an extraordinarily gifted group of players, is representative of a general unease in recognising the influence of the 41 year-old (see also here). Inevitably, the genius of Lionel Messi, Xavi and Andrés Iniesta has played a huge role in their club’s success and enabled the practise of the beautiful possession-oriented style they have become synonymous with. Nonetheless, such an evaluation is crude, simplistic and unspeakably idiotic. All 3 were present in Frank Rijkaard’s final season at the Camp Nou as Barcelona languished 18 points behind champions Real Madrid whilst the Juan Román Riquelme-inspired Villarreal finished 10 clear as runners-up. Talent was not the problem for Rijkaard’s team; Messi, Xavi and Iniesta shared a dressing room with Ronaldinho, Deco, Thierry Henry, Samuel Eto’o and Yaya Touré.
JUSTICE ALITO: I have three problems in seeing your interpretation in the language of section 282. First, the statute says the burden of establishing invalidity of a patent, et cetera, et cetera, shall rest on the parties asserting such invalidity. If Congress wanted to impose a clear and convincing burden, why in the world would they not have said that expressly in that sentence?

I became ill within three months after the last surgery, but it took a year for them to realize just how serious it was and to start running tests. They thought at first I had cancer. Normally our immune system produces proteins called antibodies that protect the body from germs and bacteria. With an autoimmune disease your immune system cannot tell the difference between these germs and bacteria and your body’s healthy tissues and creates autoantibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue. These autoantibodies cause inflammation, pain, and damage in various parts of the body. The inflammation causes massive damage that cannot be repaired. Lupus is a disease that has “flares” and remission similar to cancer. However, it is unlike cancer in the fact that cancer has abnormal tissue (tumors) and in Lupus healthy and normal tissue is what is attacked.

“I started putting in this clause about four months ago to deter home owners who are not serious. We have to let them know that, for us, there is also an opportunity cost for the hours we put in selling their homes,” said real estate agent Dayangku Rozarita.

My stop first stop of the trip was at the Fountain Valley School, a small campus with a very long driveway and a very cool, laid back feel to it.

But it was all a front, you see for a brilliant mind and when he fell in love with Harriet Vane, he said incredibly sexy-sounding things to her in French, like “tu m’enivres.” (I knew the text of Busman’s Honeymoon by heart I had read it so often).
There are other ancillary coverages’ available such as Rental Reimbursement, and Towing which can help to defer the cost associated with the same, after a covered loss.
I’ve always appreciated that phrase, “Sat Down” because it denotes a task that is finished. Jesus did it all, He alone made it possible for sinful man to be covered with Jesus righteousness which enables us to become the children of God. That is the crux. God’s timetable for His Son’s return is His timetable. It is only important to us as believers and unbelievers because at that point of His return, there will be no second chance to receive His gift of Salvation. It will be too late for those who are partying and mocking, too late for those who paid no attention, too late for those who trusted in works or some other philosophy of the world religions. Too late for those who scoffed.

Ethan has our hearts from the opening pages, his feelings for Emme as obvious to us as Emme is oblivious, and we immediately enter into a love/hate relationship with him—loving his protectiveness of Emme while simultaneously hating that he protects her even from himself. His flaws are probably the darkest and most numerous, his self-destructive behavior a burden he bears not alone, but rather one he unintentionally shares with Emme and those who most care for him, weighing all of us down until our toes brush bottom and he begins to push off and drag us all back toward the surface. Despite his behavior, he is nothing if not worthy of redemption and affection, his clear love for Emme something painful and stunning at the same time as we honestly have no idea as to whether her feelings for him can be what he so desperately wants them to be.
Folks, this story is just that, a story. It can not be substantiated or verified because it is…what did I just say….a STORY.

If you or anyone you know has a child with a learning disability, please read the following. The struggles that my son, myself and our family has had to go through when dealing with our local school board is inexcusable. Every child deserves an education that helps them succeed at a young age and will help them exceed as they grow. My son has been neglected, ignored and fallen through the cracks by our school district. Thank goodness for the wonderful teachers at the elementary school that have gone above and beyond with helping my son and our family. I share a lot of stories on this blog but keep our names out. So in keeping with that, I have blacked out our last names and personal information.
Being the “son of Gautama” means that Aśwatthāmā was a member of a brahmin family. But Arjuna was duty bound to treat him like an animal, because that is what Aśwatthāmā’s behavior merited. Classical Indian literature evaluates social status not primarily by birth-caste, but by actual behavior.

It definitely feels like summer outside! I'm loving the warm weather, but not particularly loving the fact that we have NO A/C. Sleeping in a bed with someone who always seems to be burning up probably doesn't help either. I'd much rather be laying out by a pool or people watching at the beach, but sometimes you gotta make sacrifices to live a happy life! (aka working.) I'm not sure I'm really ready to show off my pudgy, pale white belly quite yet, anyway. So, maybe it's better I'm stuck indoors working. HA.
The Empire of Poverty is the modern incarnation of the water empire, its feigned concern for social equality disguising its hunger for total power. With the third stage, the empire of poverty is mostly putting aside its pretense of controlling production in order to maximize human benefits from the products or services and is shifting over to controlling production in order to deny use of the products and services to those who need them.
Thank you so much to all of you who made Project First Day an awe-inspiring, overwhelming success!!! Give yourselves a hand, and a pat on the back! I received a total of 1474 garments/outfits from generous seamstresses all across the country and Canada. On Friday, Aug. 12, we loaded up 38 big plastic storage tubs and a couple of boxes into a rented U-Haul and took them to Irving Elementary School. Actually, Irving had been destroyed in the tornado, as had 90% of its students' homes, so an old retired school, Washington Elementary, was quickly refurbished to serve Irving's students. Someone had "Irving-ton" T-shirts made for the children! Besides the garments, there were tables of new donated shoes, and boxes and boxes of books for the taking. The distribution was on Tuesday evening, Aug. 16, on the eve of the first day of school. It was crowded, noisy, and exciting. I know we made some children happy, and we also made some mommas get teary-eyed! There were plenty of garments, with lots left over. Those will be taken to other schools which were either destroyed or had a large percentage of students affected.
Depravity Of Mind
I have barely kept up with my yard/flowers/garden. I planted all white flowers this year with a vision on moonlight lovliness. But it feels a bit boring to me. I miss the color. I found I have a frog living in my front yard garden and another frog (I think) living in my back yard garden. Do I have pictures of them? No, I guess because I just haven't enjoyed them this year.
I swear, I wish I would have found a love for running earlier in my life. It clears my mind and gives me so much fulfillment. Strange how pushing myself and sweating can bring so much joy! Ha! anybody else think I sound crazy? It's a feeling like no other. You are competing against nobody but yourself and there's something SO cool about that!
so, the blog is the only channel apart from using fb & twitter (yeah i got one too, still fresh and new~).

That was a long and horrible night as I drifted through pain and in-and-out of a drug-induced state of semi-sleep. The only bright part of the whole night was when, around 3am, the baby really started kicking me, as if to say "I'm ok in here, Mom! I made it". I smiled and put my hand on my belly, content and happy to know that I would still be feeling those kicks for many weeks to come.
I know the rules of wedding etiquette--the mother of the groom is supposed to take the lead from the mother of the bride--but L is all excited--this is her first born getting married (and the first wedding in the family of this generation) and she is super excited.

I haven't even started looking --except in the most casual way--(window shopping)!

Many of the parables come in response to questions from followers. For example, the parable of the Good Samaritan is in response to the lawyer’s questions, “What must I do to inherit eternal life?” and, “Who is my neighbor?” The parable of the Unmerciful Servant is in answer to Peter’s question, “How many times must I forgive my brother when he sins against me?”
can travel with you and withstand fads or trends. For example, I originally spotted the 1960's sofa that now sits in my living room, covered in badly worn orange crushed velvet at an antique shop in Indianapolis, over ten years ago. I wasn't shopping for a new sofa at the time but fell in love with its lines and length (95"), and had to have it. I reinvented it with fresh upholstery and silver nail heads to accentuate its sleek lines and it's traveled with me to two cities, three homes and counting. I have found that buying vintage is a terrific way to pick up pieces that have great style without breaking the bank and have had similar success with lamps, side tables and small accent chairs.

And that stuck with me. Because really, does anyone "need" to be exposed to Shakespeare? And by being exposed to Shakespeare in school, do the vast majority of public and private schoolers really develop a deep and abiding love for the famous playwright's work, or do they hate, dislike, or find absolutely useless and/or boring everything they're taught about the man and his writing?

Justice Scalia shamelessly descended into the political arena of a Senate vote count. “You can’t repeal the rest of the Act because you’re not going to get 60 votes in the Senate to repeal the rest.” Justice Stephen Breyer said firmly: “I would stay out of politics. That’s for Congress, not us.” The NYT concluded, “A split court striking down the Act will be declaring itself virtually unfettered by the law. And if that happens along party lines, with five Republican-appointed justices supporting the challenge led by 26 Republican governors, the Court will mark itself as driven by politics.”

How can you claim to live for the purpose of God in your life yet all you care about is yourself and what you can get from life, yes life is meant to be enjoyed and lived, but with God being the centre focus of all we do and aim for in life. Surely God has to take preference in your life. When we focus and ask God to show us what He wants for us, He is glorified. I know many will say and feel that it is unfair and even boring to live for God, there was a time for me when it was frustrating to consider God first whenever I wanted to do something for myself but it becomes easier. Especially the more you understand and believe that God always prospers us and that every decision that comes from Him is good and will never fail. One thing is certain, if we are born again believers, we should not be selfish and want to live for ourselves. we see in the cross how Jesus died for the whole world, Jesus sacrificed His life so that we could gain life and true life in Him. Think about your spouse or your kids, you have to consider where you are going with your future and every decision has to include them and not just what you want. The best way to know that you are not just considering yourself and being selfish, is to go to God for your advise, seek His Word, spend time reading the Bible and let Him confirm the decisions you need to make. For many of us, this can become tiresome, but don’t you want to prosper?, don’t you want to make the right decisions?, you can bet your life on the advise Jesus gives you.

Later, she was established on her tricycle, wobbling around their tiny garden, pedalling away in little spurts of blind fury. This was supposed to tire her out. Michal volunteered to be the policeman who had to check her driving license. Lying exquisitely, she insisted that the photograph of the heavily middle-aged Michal was really of her.
I love the snake at the beginning of the book! That was priceless. All of the characters are well written and I like that the husband, Brad, and the wife, Darlene, have been together for so long--that just is great to me. The fact that they are somewhat blind to their 'good kid's' issues is fitting and real. All the feelings and emotions are something that anyone can relate to but especially a married couple. It will make you think about how much God effects your lives and how much you need Him for your family!!

How to spend such a day? Today was a pretty big day: Kierkegaard’s Birthday, Cinco de Mayo, and Vanity Records first gig. I’m not quite sure I knew, really (for those of you wanting to read about Vanity records, just keep reading..and if you don’t know who Kierkegaard is, don’t worry about it). I had a wedding that was very important to me (like beyond important), but life kept me from getting there. The bride, I think, would be pleased with how I spent my time over the weekend, however. Since I couldn’t go to the wedding, I know she be pleased that I spent the evening with Vanity records.

At the weekend everything was awful today I am amused. I am amused that my life is such a mess of unreconciled stress that going to Nigeria where ‘all’ I have to do is deliver a high profile anti-corruption programme whilst been shot at by terrorists is a relief.
Trophy husband and I took a much needed weekend away last fall. We headed to the beach. By fall, all the summer crowd had returned to wherever they came from. We only had to deal with the snow-birds who were settled in and not bothering anybody.

She took a trip to visit friends in her hometown midway through our relationship. I did not join her, and there were disastrous consequences. A few days before she was scheduled to come back, she called me distraught. I asked her what was wrong and she didn’t want to give it up, but eventually did – she was raped by a childhood friend of hers. I went ballistic. I was absolutely livid. If you ever want to see the highest possible rage I can exhibit, rape someone. You had better pray that I don’t get to you before the police will, because they’ll be scraping you off of the sidewalk (and any nearby buildings and vehicles) for years when I’m done.

Charles Moore, former editor of the Daily Telegraph, produced Salisbury Paper 9 in 1981,”The Old People of Lambeth”. It was an empirical research into the real living conditions of “whites” rather than another abstract academic study. One elderly man told him, “…its our Queen and our country, why should we be afraid to go out?”

The implication is that the rebels could not possibly be worse than Gaddafi. Yet, in the light of the experience of the Iranian revolution, the AWL said they had learned their lesson about taking the words of such “Democrats” at face value. They did so, because in reality the medieavalist, theocratic, clerical-fascist regime in Iran IS, if anything, worse than that of the Shah. At least the Bonapartist regime of the Shah was modernising. In the light of that, the AWL also argued in relation to Iraq, that the clerical-fascist resistance could not be viewed as a national liberation force, because its very politics were the very opposite of liberation for the Iraqi people.
Glares, shaking fists, huffing and puffing along with frantic lane change attempts add to the fun had by all.

I believe that we should tax everyone equally, not at tiered rates (remember, only 47% of the country pays income tax anyways). If you get lucky in the stock market or work hard to make your small business grow larger, why should you have to pay more in taxes? To lower your net profits? When that happens, there’s no incentive to innovate, create, or make money because, at the end of every fiscal year, you won’t have any more money than someone who works for only 9 bucks an hour managing the drive-thru at Wendy’s.

Since the announcement of the court judgment on April 26, legal experts are divided on its impact. Some say it automatically disqualifies Mr Gilani as a member of the National Assembly and he ceases to be the prime minister. But there are others who believe that only the speaker can decide on the matter as the final authority.

In Chicago at the end of the nineteenth century amid the smoke of industry and the clatter of trains there lived two men, both handsome, both blue-eyed, and both unusually adept at their chosen skills. Each embodied an element of the great dynamic that characterized the rush of America toward the twentieth century. One was an architect, the builder of many of America's most important structures, among them the Flatiron building in New York and Union Station in Washington, D.C.; the other was a murderer, one of the most prolific in history and harbinger of an American archetype, the urban serial killer. Although the two never met, at least not formally, their fates were linked by a single, magical event, one largely fallen from modern recollection but that in its time was considered to possess a transformative power nearly equal to that of the Civil War.

As such, Godard's sense of nonconformity was the solution to Gardner's problem. Rosenblum, already a fan of Godard's editing technique from having used the style for a crucial sequence when he cut Sidney Lumet's THE PAWNBROKER, began to apply some Godardian touches again with Gardner's input. The author on his own shot footage of morning commuters and synchronized them to incongruous jazz and march music to satirize workaday drudgery. A long introductory sequence with Murray and Nick was not only shaved down, but cut up jaggedly to suggest that instead of a single morning's conversation, we were watching an ongoing argument they'd had for weeks. An exchange of florid endearments between Murray and Sandra was replaced by a tandem bike ride underscored with a sweet and crackly ukulele song. The bulk of the movie still stayed focused on dialogue exchanges in stationary settings, but now there was a sense that this movie was going to stay grounded when it needed to be grounded, and expand like the circus car metaphor that its title suggested when it needed to expand. To be sure, there would have been too much sentimentality in this story for the aloof Godard to really enjoy it as tribute, and in turn your average New York Nebbish would likely look at one of Godard's films and say, "This is cute. This is nice. WHAT THE HELL IS IT?" But these two disparate parties in the common ground allowed for a fine, timeless movie to emerge.
Hopefully sometime before the hormones strike their hefty blow, my Alpha dog will rediscover her inner nonconformist…the one who was once so often heard to say, “That’s stupid. I’m not doing it.”

For years, the British Establishment in its myriad forms dismissed Hackgate as conspiracy theory. I took an interest in early 2010 because I overheard two pissed celebs railing about it in The Groucho Club. I can’t say who they were, but I’d imagine some of you can guess. The point is, until then I’d never heard of Hackgate. I thought of Rupert Murdoch as a piece of multinational anti-matter, but that was merely a spur to action.The idea at that stage of the Prime Minister being implicated I would’ve regarded as ludicrous. But by December of that year, it was obvious he had either blundered into, conceived, or at the very least exploited part of what was going on.

I've been making homemade yogurt for over a year now, and was thrilled to discover how easy it really is.Our family goes through a lot of yogurt! This past summer, the kids and I were given a free sample of Greek style yogurt at the store. Oh boy! One look at the cost and I knew I had to come up with a way to make it at home.
I had my doubts about this book when I picked it up. I wasn’t totally thrilled by the cover art, though I thought the back blurb made it sound really promising. Plus it has quotations from two authors I enjoy – Nalini Singh and Karen Chance – so I was willing to take a chance. I’m really happy that I did since I couldn’t put it down! Kasey Mackenzie has created a wonderful world and a great story with Red Hot Fury. She shows a firm understanding of Greek mythology and has added a great twist by having them police the arcane world in her novel. Riss is a wonderful, spunky lead character and I loved following her on this adventure. Plus, the relationship between Harpies and Furies is very interesting and I thought Riss’ various forms, including her transformation from a blue-eyed blonde to a green-eyed brunette when she’s in full Fury form, was a neat extra.

Here at the Microsoft Security Response Center, we investigate thousands of security reports every year. In some cases, we find that a report describes a bona fide security vulnerability resulting from a flaw in one of our products; when this happens, we develop a patch as quickly as possible to correct the error. (See “A Tour of the Microsoft Security Response Center”). In other cases, the reported problems simply result from a mistake someone made in using the product. But many fall in between. They discuss real security problems, but the problems don’t result from product flaws. Over the years, we’ve developed a list of issues like these, that we call the 10 Immutable Laws of Security.

And so it is with Glasgow-based duo Anneke Kampman and James Scott, aka Conquering Animal Sound. Their debut album Kammerspiel is a ghostly collection of minimalistic beats, loops and fragile ambience, overlaid with Kampman’s beatifully frail vocal. Its delicateness and woozy air mean that it is a record which is best absorbed late at night, preferably at the point last thing when your brain is at its sleepiest. In this context it becomes almost lullaby-esque, with Kampman’s soft burr tailor-made for soothing away the mental aches of the daily cut and thrust.

. . . someone said to Him, ’Lord, I will follow You wherever You go’ —Luke 9:57 Our Lord’s attitude toward this man was one of severe discouragement, “for He knew what was in man” (John 2:25). We would have said, “I can’t imagine why He lost the opportunity of winning that man! Imagine being so cold to him and turning him away so discouraged!” Never apologize for your Lord. The words of the Lord hurt and offend until there is nothing left to be hurt or offended. Jesus Christ had no tenderness whatsoever toward anything that was ultimately going to ruin a person in his service to God. Our Lord’s answers were not based on some whim or impulsive thought, but on the knowledge of “what was in man.” If the Spirit of God brings to your mind a word of the Lord that hurts you, you can be sure that there is something in you that He wants to hurt to the point of its death.

I turned Ashley's sketch into a 2 page spread. I needed to do this for 2 reasons. It worked for the photos, and the design element for ThanksLiving is symmetry. The photos are so vivid and have so many colors, I needed to keep it simple. I wanted them to be the focus, not all the stuff surrounding them. I stuck to white card stock and added some color around the edges by punching 5 more CS colors with the same punch, then stapling them to the page. I added the same colors of twine and brads along the vertical edge, adding a subtly misted flower to the middle. I misted white CS scraps with the same 5 colors and used them to anchor the title and journaling. A variety of alpha letters and I was finished. I know I could have added a bunch of stuff, but I am happy with the way it looks.

How are we to trust our region to a corporation who says they will “focus like a laser” on safety then cuts corners by buying trailers that are proven hazards? And how can we trust a government who allowed those trailers to be sold and plans to allow them to be used as residences for clean-up workers? What has happened to government of, by and FOR the people?

I don't at all claim to have a crystal ball, but I did try to understand and talk about racial tension in America some months before the Trayvon Martin brought it to the fore. I did not qualify and apologize enough in my language, and failed to insert the obligatory "I'm not racist, but..." disclaimer, so I sucked up charges of racism for that.

A friend was talking about God’s efficiency in the work that He does. He may give a word and that one word sets something in motion that brings healing to many. He may give a vision that when shared lines up with the word or a vision that they had. Sometimes it takes time to see these things come to fruition and other times it’s immediate.

Lastly, I want to encourage you to surround yourself with white light, uplifting music, books, television, youtube, and whatever you can get your hands on. This is no time to sink into the lower vibrations this world offers. Don’t give up or give in. I understand during this time you might feel like not continuing on the path you’ve been walking. It might seem hopeless and ridiculous at times. Just know, I’m going through this to. No matter what stage of light work you’re going through, when one of these major earth transitions hits, we all feel it! You are not alone. Surround yourself with like minded spiritual friends and look up encouraging sayings! There is an entire host of angels watching over you and your spirit guides are there when you get ready to ask for help! Never, NEVER underestimate the power of a bubble of white light of protection around you. See this as an egg of white light that covers and goes below you, completely surrounding you. Infuse your bubble with pink for love and feel the comfort that comes with this gentle practice.

As a result, the Afghan Taliban’s leadership in Pakistan is certainly not decimated. Nor do Pakistan’s actions constitute the “sea change” in its behavior, as some observers have argued. Instead, they represent a recalibration of Pakistan’s evolving policy: rather than supporting the declared U.S. goal of defeating the Taliban, the recent arrests exemplify a Pakistani effort to seize control over the process of negotiations and reconciliation that its military leaders believe is both imminent and inevitable in the Afghan conflict. And it is emphatically motivated by the conviction that India, not the Afghan Taliban, is the main enemy to be neutralized in the Afghan endgame.
I was so taken with my “discovery” of the mural that I had forgotten to get the name of the business and exact address…so I had to make a return trip to collect that info. When I went back, I found that the bottom half of the mural had been blackened-out…covered…in only four or five days from when I shot these photos. I went into the store to see who I might find who could explain what was going on with the mural. I found a young man behind the counter, Oz, who told me that the whole mural is covered and replaced every year…has been for the last four or five years now. Each time they have it replaced, the graffiti artist Kier re-paints the whole thing…with spray cans of paint. The murals usually contain a message…ideas submitted by store customers, neighboring businesses, the Korner Market owners, and Kier himself. The subject matter for the present mural is 2012…with the intertwined concerns of the Maya prediction about the ending of life as we know it, politics, UFOs, and society in general. You’ll notice the three-headed image of Greenspan, Obama, and Bush…alien experimentation…and frightened masses.
Having highlighted the easy part that everybody is on twitter, let me move on to the difficult part. Once you are on twitter, what next? Not everybody can succeed on twitter.

The moment a celebrity signs up on twitter, not only it becomes the headlines of the next day’s dailies but also fellow celebs start giving warm welcome by shouting out the newbie and urging their followers to show some love (read follow this new celebrity as well).

Leftism, on the other hand, IS intrinsically authoritarian and power-loving and will always therefore tend in the direction of government domination. It is only non-authoritarian to the extent that is thwarted by external influences (such as democracy) from achieving its aims. Leftists in democratic societies do of course commonly deny authoritarian motivations but that is just part of their "cover". Deeds speak louder than words.

He paused, gazed over his spectacles at the more interested students and, as was his habit, smiled in a rather uncertain way as though half expectant that at least the best students would get the full significance of his remarks. This time he was not disappointed, for the attention of the entire class was focused upon the problem being placed before them. To even the least imaginative, the idea of causing a piece of cloth or perhaps a whole automobile to completely disappear was interesting and smacked of Aladdin at his best.
And, so, we listened, shared, and deliberated together: How do we respond in concrete ways to advance just peace in changing times?

How do we struggle in and across our respective traditions to understand each other?

So if you ask "Are you so excited to see Ruthie?" and I respond with a "yeah" followed by a few standard statements, and then quickly change the subject; it's not that I'm not happy to see her. I am. But as soon as I think about seeing her, I think about leaving her. And that makes me emotional, and I'm not a fan of getting emotional in front of people - because someone might try to hug me and I go stiff as a board when people try to hug me. Unless it's Ben. Or Eli. Or my parents. Or a handful of friends that are super comfortable with hugging. I know, I'm a weirdo.
This is a risky approach, a radical embrace of trust, and, to quote Whitsitt again, it “scares the crud” out of most people. Churches are, generally speaking, like most other institutions, incredibly risk adverse. Yet religion – the spirituality at its core – takes risks in stride. Trust is part of the DNA of true spirituality. What if it became core to the way we do church, as well?

Tappi Tíkarrass appeared on Rokk í Reykjavík, a TV documentary directed by Friðrik Þór Friðriksson. Tappi Tíkarrass was one of the 19 bands featured in the film and collaborated with two songs: “Hrollur” and “Dúkkulísur”, both of them sung by Björk and Eyþór with Oddur replacing Guðmundur in drums.
Each evening as the sun started to set we'd pack up from down by the water, shower the children, cook a yummy but simple BBQ dinner and salad and then settle in for a few quiet drinks and talk until late. On NYE we got the kids to bed and got the cards out ... and a bottle of Baileys ... and a bottle of Butterscotch Schnapps ... which 4 of us demolished in less than 2 hours!!! We had the giggles up playing cards, we counted down to midnight, hugs and kisses all round then it was back to cards and finally bed.

So, I guess I'll end by saying I am at peace now. I know that Jetta will always be in my life, not exactly in the capacity that I thought she would, but I love her with all my heart and will continue to provide for her until it's her time to go. I have a definite answer and can move forward knowing that I did all I could for her with all the resources we could find.

"I live minutes from Saratoga NY with my husband of 35 years and we have three wonderful daughters ages 30, 25, and 20. Ever since I can remember I have been in love with all kinds of crafting. My grandmother was a seamstress and I could spend hours looking through her tin of buttons and box of laces. My mom is in her 80's and is an avid quilter so I guess the creative thing is in my blood. I love cross stitch and my walls are filled with samplers. I loved the vast choice of thread and linen colors. But it would take weeks to complete one project.
I’m always irked when a book opens with a section on “how to use this book.” If you can read, you can use a book. Paltrow explains that to each recipe she has attached a variety of symbols: make ahead, quick, vegetarian, vegan, one-pot meal and dress-up meal. Thanks. I think I can figure out for myself that if the prep time is 10 minutes, it’s quick, and that roasted cauliflower is vegetarian. Paltrow also disappoints when she suggests how to “make it vegan” for many meals. Leaving out cheese, or replacing chicken with vegetables, may make a meal free of animal products, but where is the vegetarian protein? Calling a meal vegan that skimps on taste and protein is an easy way out and a disservice to a growing vegan population. Frankly, I would have expected more from Paltrow.
The RV’s proposed Occupy South African Embassies action focuses specifically on the plight of the Boervolk for two reasons: 1. it is the Boervolk who directly represent the 4,000 farm murders in South Africa since the coming to power of the African National Congress in 1994 and

Thursday was BEACH DAY! Yep! We wore beach attire (sunglasses and all), had a bit of a luau theme in our classroom and brought our beach towels ready to soak up the sun! We began by sharing our experiences of the beach... very few have ever been to the beach or have seen the ocean so it was fun listening to what they knew first hand. Then we read a few books about the beach and the ocean. I love the book Commotion in the Ocean by Giles Andreae.
My writing comes from a dominant man - my father. He wrote, he sang, he played and cried. I remember being so impressed by his improvisation at the piano - a ballad about our journeys riding horses together. He sang about the things we had in common. I think he knew I needed to be reminded what those things were every now and then.
The contemporary understanding exemplifies the “Cartesian Duality” between mind and body: the difference between mind and body is exemplified in the contemporary Feminist notion that although our bodies are different in being male or female the minds are the same. This implies a split between mind and body but in fact the two interact as we get to know ourselves we learn that our thoughts and experiences are bound up with our knowledge of our bodies. This is why men and women have different natures. The mind is linked to body or the physical structure of mind, else it could float around and attach itself respectively to other bodies and minds and interact. People of different sizes and disabilities feel differently about the world and act accordingly. The difference between male and female bodies has a similar effect. We treat people by their size or members of the opposite sex differently.
A man sat at a metro station in Washington DC and started to play the violin; it was a cold January morning. He played six Bach pieces for about 45 minutes. During that time, since it was rush hour, it was calculated that thousand of people went through the station, most of them on their way to work.
ITS A GIGANTIC BRA!
What is your responsibility to your child? I pose this question because many times I have seen the way adults handle their children and I just shake my head in amazement. I live with a philosophy of child first, me second. I believe this has worked well for me so far. My daughter is very disciplined, well-behaved and very independent. When I see my child around other children her age I am amazed by the level of maturity she displays. I often wish I could take those other kids and give them a good spanking! Some parents seem to be less than interested in what their children are doing and are not doing anything to correct their child’s behavior. Why do parents turn a blind eye when their child is out of line? Why do parents tolerate children who are disrespectful towards them? I grew up in a very strict household and I never dared cross that line and my daughter is experiencing the same. I think far too often parents want to be friends with their kids, instead of being parents. I think this is partly what’s wrong with our society. Not being involved and not disciplining your child makes you a bad parent in my eyes.

Life give us happiness's in fractions,seconds and moments, so here I dedicate this photo to all of you my friends, who have been with me all this time ( even during my absence) keeping my blog and my passion alive..... forcing me to come back, again and again, reminding me that life is not all about making a livelihood !!
And as far as connection and trust, I feel that to some degree people connect in a much deeper way since the invention of blogs and Facebook and other media. Sure it contributes to the wham bam mentality of people who suffer slightly from ADHD. But it also creates another layer to a person that you might not ever see in an actual in-person interaction. For example, I don’t talk about comic books in EVERY conversation – though I try my darndest – but it wasn’t until I became FB friends with someone that he and I started trading books and talking about different characters and story lines. Would it have come up in conversation? Probably eventually. But he also lives a bazillion miles away so it would have taken awhile.
Since the story is quite personal, I never really spoke about it in public.
Also out today THE SHADOW #1 (by Garth Ennis and Aaron Campbell - from Dynamite) and NEAR DEATH #7 (by Jay Faerber and SImone Guglielmini - from Image), other two really good books I was lucky enough to do covers for.
By late afternoon we are hearing reports that the mutineers have taken over the national radio and TV broadcasting center in downtown Bamako, where I just had an appointment on Monday. State TV and radio have been off the air since around 4 p.m. I first hear gunfire coming from downtown, across the Niger River, around 5 p.m. — just sporadic pops and cracks, rifles firing probably into the air. I don’t hear any bursts answering other bursts. It sounds less like shots fired in anger, more like shots fired in frustration.

None of us has a time machine; at least I don’t think that none of us does. If you have one, please use it to send me an email before I post this to correct me…. Okay, no emails. So we can’t go back in time, what does this mean? What happened simply happened. We can’t change it now. The one thing we can do, however, is change the meaning that we have ascribed to the events. If the meaning isn’t serving your higher good, then how can you change it?
Will there still be backwards steps? Sure. For the past week I have cried my eyes out all over again, triggered by my husband’s business trip, grieving about everything, and feeling like I had fallen way, way down again. I probably drove my coach James batty with my wild fluctuations in moods and insecurities. But I want to start rediscovering that sense of self that I had lost in my trauma. I WILL move forward.
Demitri ignored my protest and continued to address Eli. “So, you threatened to taste her flesh.” His fingers tightened their grip around my wrist. “In the interest of investigating this matter further, I invoke the Silence.”

“He needs to,” Alexandre told her. “Should anything happen to the prince’s armour or his horse, Gareth could forfeit his life.”
I wanted a quick and easy dinner to make last night and this was just perfect. It's pretty simple - slice up some of your favorite veggies (I used green peppers, onions, carrots, broccoli, and a few pressed garlic cloves) and saute them in olive oil. While those are cooking, open a box of frozen perogies and saute them in another pan until they are lightly browned, about 8-10 minutes. Heat up some sausage (I used Bob Evan's fully cooked links) and toss everything together.
Prayerfully these little guys will make it through the season and I'll be looking for plum recipes !! As I drove out the road I noticed I'm surely not the only one with that prayer as the apple orchards are almost in full bloom.

Hey there,
Side One is a piece of funk propaganda put out there by the American Dairy Association of Mississipi, encouraging people to drink more pure dairy liquid presumably through the power of dance grooves alone. "Milk - the basic! Milk - the basic!" the singers insist persuasively whilst the basslines and rhythms cut powerfully through the mix. And it works. Just writing about this now, I'm persuaded to pull a bottle out of the fridge and glug it down my neck, and that's more than those frigging terrifying Humphrey adverts ever did for me as a child. If I ever find out that the population of Mississipi has a lower rate of osteoporosis than Britain, I will not be surprised.
If you want to spend a little time outside, or your kids just need some room to roam around, this is a good stop for you.

This weekend sees the 6th round of the FA Cup. The teams remaining are surely looking ahead to an appearance at Wembley as for many this will now be the main focus of their season.

I had made myself several pairs of shorts - long shorts, almost like skirts.
Anti-Tobacco propaganda has convinced a less than knowledgeable public that it is non-smokers alone that bare the costs of indigent healthcare, and defying all common sense logic, the public embraces that belief.

Here Are Five How to Get Taller Tips That Will Work For Anyone
Now, for those that are afraid, there is nothing to be afraid of. The worse they will do is say no. They won’t cut your service off, increase your fees, or yell at you (although if they do, you can report them for doing so). So what exactly are the risks for asking to save money? There are none! You have everything to gain, and nothing to lose. Why? Because you’re the customer with money and they want your business. They will usually do whatever it takes to keep your business. They would rather take a $10/month loss rather than not having your business at all, and losing out on $100/month. And if they do say no, remember that each representative that you speak to is different. Feel free to call again and see if you have better luck with someone else.

Titanic – The Final Word – Where we got to see Jim “bossy pants” Cameron have his final word on Titanic. Actually this was pretty good. There were a team of experts providing opinion so they could work out as much as possible how the titanic broke up and sank. The explanation with a banana was particularly illuminating. The did a new animation showing how they believed it had happened. Jim pointed out with the new evidence what was wrong with the film. Good documentary, recommended.

I honestly can say that what God has placed in my life that He has called good,, is still good. The number of these things may have changed with time, but God’s definition of good has not changed.

It's been an up and down week, so much going on and I was so pleased for a little break last night - I went out for a gorgeous meal with some lovely girly friends and we had a lovely enjoyable time, great food and great company and a good giggle, we were laughing until tears ran, I had severe face ache afterwards!!!

Norwich and Swansea have been fantastic this season and should be lauded for staying up. Swansea especially have been mind-boggling – playing pass and move football, defenders overlapping all over the place, with players found in the Football League. They’re a real reason to love this competition, despite the throwbacks in charge of it. If Chelsea do fall short in Europe this season then we’ll hear about how the premiership is in decline, but I’d say it’s as watchable now as at any time over the last two decades.

On a side note, I live in NH if you couldn’t tell from the Blog title. I am getting sick of the snow. My car is stuck in the driveway right now and I can’t get it out because it’s too low.

Moving to England, I was amazed at how one plus one equaled two. Life in London seems to be so full of certainties compared to life in the Philippines. I grew up in a middle class household constantly struggling against the odds. I always had the feeling that I had no control over my fate – good or bad, the future was beyond my control.
Nominees and VIP guests were greeted on the red carpet with champagne, cocktails and canapés at the prestigious 47th annual Fleur du Cap Theatre Awards, held at the Baxter Theatre on Sunday 18 March 2012. Director and choreographer Alfred Hinkel took a new approach to this year’s entertainment and created a production that involved Heather Mac, dancers from his new company Garage and the two Masters of Ceremony, Alan Committie and Hannes van Wyk. It was certainly a magical evening for ‘Klaasvakie’ with Wilna Snyman winning Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play and Nicole Hanekom receiving the prize for Best Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Play. The award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play went to Carel Nel for ‘Die Rebellie van Lafras Verwey’. Actor and lecturer Christopher Weare was awarded the Fleur Du Cap Lifetime Achievement award for his contribution to South African theatre. With 20 categories this year, winners were awarded a beautiful silver medallion and R15,000 making a Fleur du Cap the most coveted award in the industry.

But I think I'm not over thinking it that (512) has taken over the best beer title for Austin. Lord knows there's more competition on the way. But that IPA, Wit, and Brown Ale just seal the deal for me. I couldn't get enough of the stuff. The Brown ale was very chewy, malty, a touch of syrup, and the hops cut it just right. No sense of the 7.6 ABV. The IPA was a great piney thing. Just great while hanging out in the chill. The wit was a perfect citrus flavor with medium body coming from the oats, ranks right up there with some of the better wits I've had. I'm loving it man. Just need these guys to get some handles down here and we are on our way.

Awhile back I was chatting with a girl I met at a wedding, and she told me about this delicious meal she had recently made for a dinner party. In all honesty, it sounded ‘meh’ at best – spinach, chickpeas, and sweet potatoes? But since she wouldn’t stop raving about it, I had to google it. I found something close to what she was talking about and got to work. You know what? She was right. I never would have given this recipe a second thought if I had found it on my own, but based on her recommendation, I made it and was blown away. Here is the (healthy, vegetarian!) recipe:

When we think of customer loyalty, we often think about ways to intrigue prospects and engage customers, building a relationship over time. So you might be surprised to find out the extent to which the first impression actually fuels customer loyalty. First impressions aren’t just critical to customer loyalty, they’re essential. In First Impressions Critical for Fueling Customer Loyalty on marketing charts.com, an April 2012 survey by ClickFox reveals that “customer loyalty is most often formed as a result of first impressions…”

Jac L’Etoile has always been haunted by the past, her memories infused with the exotic scents that she grew up surrounded by as the heir to a storied French perfume company. In order to flee the pain of those remembrances—and of her mother’s suicide—she moves to America, leaving the company in the hands of her brother Robbie. But when Robbie hints at an earth-shattering discovery in the family archives and then suddenly goes missing—leaving a dead body in his wake—Jac is plunged into a world she thought she’d left behind.

As for plot, for the most part, the book just goes along until Em uncovers the big family secret that I had kind of already guessed at and reacts very predictably.
