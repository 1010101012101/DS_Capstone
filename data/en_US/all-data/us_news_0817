So symbolic is the cast-iron skillet in the South that Paul and Angela Knipple chose to title their new book after it: "The World in a Skillet: A Food Lover's Tour of the New American South" (University of North Carolina, $35, 296 pages). The book tells the stories of people from around the world who've settled in the South and are helping to change how the region's food is defined. Although not every recipe calls for a skillet, each has "the same sense of enduring heritage and family," according to the authors.
A surprising boost in global oil inventories, aided by supply increases from Saudi Arabia, is blunting the possibility that sanctions against Iran will drive up oil prices—potentially undercutting Tehran on the eve of its first nuclear talks with the West in more than a year.

Edwin F. O'Brien, leader of the Baltimore archdiocese, has revealed himself to be a cynical, misguided critic of the Obama administration ("Fight over birth control," Jan. 26). He says it's a pity that the sincere convictions of religious groups are disrespected in the United States. The real pity is that religions are allowed any influence on government policies at all.

In 2009, that number was nine, including four cases for marijuana possession on federal lands. In 2010, federal prosecutors pursued only four criminal marijuana cases. They have yet to file a marijuana case this year, according to court records.

The new VOIP service allowed us to target mid-size corporations and organizations. Until then, we had no reason to approach a larger business. Their technology departments were bigger than our entire company.
TR: Right. Definitely. And there's day to day, how they prepare and how they keep themselves focused on the game that day. Through the season, I know that your mind can start to wander even in an inning and how they recognize that and how they have something that gets them dialed back in. It's something like that that I think will be a huge help in the future.

"Candidates like Romney don't get any points out of anything but winning," said Popkin, who is writing a book on presidential campaigns called "The Candidate." "Romney is not willing to make the kinds of promises that excite a passionate small number. He would rather lose going for 50 (percent) than win going for 20."
All lenders must approve. The four key banks -- JP Morgan, Citibank, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs -- already have approved, said a person familiar with the banks' position. Some smaller parties also were said to be holdouts.

Jacob starts a furniture-making business and pays occasional visits to London, where Anna works at a magazine. They visit with her good-natured parents (Oliver Muirhead and Alex Kingston). Anna suggests that Jacob could move to London, but no, he insists, he is just getting a foothold in LA. Back at his loft, he drifts toward another woman (Jennifer Lawrence), while Anna develops a relationship with a neighbor (Charlie Bewley). Why Jacob won't start again in London is one of the more-troubling aspects of the story. Does it mean he didn't feel as strongly for her as he seemed to? Is he growing apart? Or is it simply a weak link in the plot?

Overall, most holiday shopping forecasts predict a 2 to 4 percent bump in sales this year after a 5.2 percent increase last year.
Seeing it in 2-D, the movie played well enough. Catching it a second time this week, in 3-D, with a raucous, eager crowd, provided that little extra something that lifted the experience up a level. While 3-D isn't crucial to your engagement with "The Avengers," it helps. The Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey's palette, nice and bright, compensates for the dimness factor that comes with putting on those ill-fitting glasses. Compare the scenes set on the planet Asgard in Whedon's film with the early, turgid chunks of director Kenneth Branagh's "Thor," and you have the difference between a sleekly burnished surface and murk.

"An opera is an incredibly collaborative work, so I want to thank the Minnesota Opera for being so wonderful, and my librettist, Mark Campbell. He figured out a beautiful architecture for the piece."
Grassley's amendment is indeed written too broadly, applying to far more exchanges of information than the sort done for hedge funds and stock traders. But the pursuit of political intelligence is a potentially corrupting force, given the value that stock traders may place on insights from inside Congress or the administration. For example, being the first to know about a new tax break that's been slipped into a bill could enable a trader to profit when the rest of the market finds out and reacts. Doing so might involve a consultant posing as a concerned constituent, or buying enough goodwill to obtain the kind of access to lawmakers, aides and documents that the general public doesn't get.

CALDWELL — Here is what other musicians love about Andy White: He’s cool. Always was, still is. He is what cool was in the beginning, before the word — like musicians — became overexposed and commercialized. A coolness earned with his wrists that doesn’t need to be reinforced with his mouth.
"We've been here a long time, and this is the first time anything like this has happened," he said.
How they pulled it off in the middle of one of Oregon's worst recessions offers an object lesson not only in the oft-neglected art of compromise, but also in personal and political evolution. Neither is the same politician he was when first taking office.

"When I say they're going to start, there's so many different roles," Ryan said. "There's so many different things they're going to start on. There's sub-team, there's this team, there's all those different things. They're going to play significantly. Is it 100 percent that it's all 16 games? It really depends on what we're in."

By the time the bill cleared the Senate, $300 million in China hub tax credits were removed and replaced with Compete Missouri, a new program that would be made up of six existing state tax incentives and under the control of the executive branch.
As you wander Nokia Plaza, the open area in the middle of the L.A. Live campus, you sense the architects and developers straining to conjure a great civic commons, a gathering place that buzzes 24/7 while the ads roll endlessly on the big screens above. But we're not there yet. Too many parking lots and dead zones linger between L.A. Live and the other nodes of energy downtown. And as a crank from way back in the 20th century, I'm still wistful for the days when an entertainment district needed a bookshop and music store.
Europe's economy is barely growing, and sharp government spending cuts might tip it back into recession. If that happens, slowing output by U.S. manufacturers could hinder the broader economic recovery.
"Getting 24 plays was fun," Hundley said. "But I don't worry about whether I'm getting looked at longer. I just trying to master my craft."
Each evening, Hope and her family spent time chatting with O'Neill and his team. Finally, Hope told O'Neill that if Hansen was out of contention, she'd switch her allegiance to his colt. And that's how it played out as the seventh-grader cheered on I'll Have Another.
Of course, another alternative is that the uninsured sick simply don't get treated and get worse, suffer needlessly or pass infectious diseases to those around them. Surely that's not the trade-off we're going to insist on for smaller government.
Most recently, Rataj represented Tina Stone, one of the defendants in the Hutaree terror trial acquitted last month of all charges.
It is the human conundrum: To be entrusted with a powerful and precious truth, and to inevitably be found unworthy of it. It is a condition that has sparked anger and sorrow in Oregon, Wisconsin, Ireland, Germany and surely everywhere where humans preach in the name of God.

"This is great news for the City of Thornton. City Council has wanted to bring jobs and development to this important corridor to Thornton for quite a while," said Thornton Mayor Heidi Williams.
But a close look at the U.S. solar industry suggests that the tariffs may actually be a job killer because the vast majority of positions in the sector aren't on the assembly line. Instead, upward of 70% of U.S. solar employment is in installation, sales and distribution — and companies that hire those workers argue solar cells must get significantly cheaper to remain competitive with other energy sources.
A 92-year-old Holocaust survivor from Yugoslavia who, in his younger days, was a world-class table tennis champion, Herskovich opened his store in 1957. Both he and his son, Emmanuel, who is testing for the Richmond Police Department, believe the city is improving.

(Another sure way to know kids watch too much baseball on television: Pitchers and catchers invariably hold their gloves over their mouths when they confer on the mound. God knows the opposing team might read their lips on the national telecast of this crucial 12-and-under clash.)

If the crying is really disturbing and lasts for more than four to five minutes, you can ask the parents to step outside with the child. Of course, it is important to be as kind and calm as possible so that there are no feathers ruffled. Yelling down, up or over several rolls of seats at the adult is not the diplomatic way to get the response you and others would like. Unless the person is close to where you are sitting, it is best to get up and calmly request that the child be taken out into the waiting area or lobby.

The people of Afghanistan have endured violence for decades. They have been confronted with occupation - by the Soviet Union, and then by foreign al Qaeda fighters who used Afghan land for their own purposes. So tonight, I want the Afghan people to understand - America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We will support efforts by the Afghan government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan grounded in mutual respect - to isolate those who destroy; to strengthen those who build; to hasten the day when our troops will leave; and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner, and never your patron.

Siversen is clever with his risottos and pastas, too. A blue crab risotto ($15), topped with a farm egg, is sensuous and lush. A rock shrimp risotto is a lesson in subtlety, but then Siversen surprises with the sweet poetry of a cured lemon finish, a crispy spark of arugula. A morel gnudi ($13) delights; this hard-to-execute pasta nearly reaches its ethereal, pillowlike promise and is then emboldened by an earthy complement of crispy chicken thighs in a tarragon sauce.
According to preliminary national estimates from Nielsen, ''Missing'' averaged a 2.0 rating/6 share in adults 18-49 and 10.6 million viewers overall , topping the demo score for six of the seven episodes of ''Charlie's Angels'' to air in the timeslot last fall. While the 18-49 score is adequate , especially during daylight savings time , it was among older viewers that the show fared best, including a healthy 2.8/8 in adults 25-54 that left it behind only ''American Idol'' in the 8 o'clock hour. The drama, in which Ashley Judd plays a former CIA operative looking for her son, is scheduled to play Thursdays at 8 for the rest of the television season.

That was reflected in how the markets have reacted. Greek shares plunged 8.2 percent in early trading, then recouped some ground. France’s CAC-40 was up 0.7 percent and Spain’s Ibex-35 was up 1.5 percent. Germany’s DAX was flat.
The upshot is this: Earning one more dollar to push your income from $500,000 a year to $500,001 a year would cost an extra $2,482 in state income taxes, or $2,752 if you file jointly. That makes no sense, and it gives the impression that Maryland tax law is hashed out on the fly, with little thought to the consequences. That, more than the fiscal impact on people making a half-million dollars a year, makes this bad policy. It also may well be unique; officials at the National Conference of State Legislators, the Federation of Tax Administrators and the Tax Foundation were unable to think of any other state that has a bracket like this one. That's not the kind of distinction we need to have.

Cultural collisions occur on George's side as well, and not all are light. To him, a thug is merely a "troublemaker from East Rochester High."

Recently, the 48-year-old Cleveland woman became worried when a clog was detected in the arteriovenous fistula -- a port in her arm used to link her to the dialysis machine that cleans her blood.

A 2000 article in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., for example, found in 321 adults that a combination of medication and therapy worked better than either individually. And a 2008 study in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at 488 children with anxiety disorder who received cognitive behavioral therapy, sertraline (Zoloft), a combination of the two or a placebo. After a three-month period, 80% of the children undergoing combination therapy had improved, compared with 60% in therapy, 55% taking medications alone and 23% on the placebo.
Throughout the season, I asked numerous coaches if they were trying anything different to cope with the condensed 66-game schedule. To a man, they all said no, they were trying to win each game as it comes, sticking with the one-game-at-a-time credo that is ingrained in coaches at all levels.

The bill is expected to be the major focus of medical-marijuana-related lobbying at the state Capitol during this year's legislative session, which starts today.

School is not just a system that takes in work and gives out grades, though some students treat it as such. While there is input and output in schools, it is necessary to recognize that students typically do not learn because they turned in their homework and got an "A." We learn because we studied and understood the material. These two processes are usually related, but are by no means synonymous. A transcript full of A's is meaningless unless you have the knowledge to back it up. But why has cheating become more prevalent?
So it will be President Hollande, who recently said that "if the markets are worried (by my policies), I will tell them here and now that I will leave them with no space to act." Tough words, but what does "no space to act" actually mean? Does it mean anything at all? The markets didn't think so, which is why they did not go into meltdown as soon as Hollande's election became a certainty.

A married individual who has never worked under a Social Security-covered job can collect spousal benefits as early as age 62 on their current spouse's Social Security record. At full retirement age, the spousal benefit is equal to one half of the benefit available to the worker spouse.

This is where we start to see the value of financial planning in maximizing Social Security benefits.

WISCONSIN: Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett won the Democratic primary in the state's historic recall election, emerging from a field of three Democrats to face Republican Gov. Scott Walker next month. Barrett's victory sets up a June 5 rematch of the 2010 governor's race in what will be the culmination of an effort to oust the first-term Republican. Anger over Walker's proposal to take collective bargaining rights from public workers — it passed last year — spurred the recall effort, which brought in more than 900,000 petition signatures. Walker has embodied the Republican rise to power in 2010 and hopes to avoid becoming just the third governor to be recalled in U.S. history. He has tapped his status as a national conservative rock star to raise a record $25 million so far, most of it from out of state.

Took up marathoning and lost about zero weight. Took up not drinking so much wine and dropped about 25 pounds. A lesson somewhere in there. But my favorite story: Used to conduct classes on the Federalist Papers in his house.
Toby hired Kirit Patel, chief cardiologist at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital, to review the autopsy. Patel disagreed with the findings. "After examining the history of the events and the time line of heroin, alcohol and the other stressors ... I am not convinced that his death was primarily from overdose of heroin," Patel wrote in a letter.

As a resident of Maryland, I am outraged by the recent "doomsday budget" and the real possibility of more cuts in vital services like law enforcement, education, libraries, reduction of personnel, etc. I find it unacceptable when I hear or read about major corporations complaining that they are being overtaxed and threaten to move their operations overseas. Some of these companies exploit loopholes in the tax laws to leave billions in unpaid taxes for the 99 percent of us to shoulder the burden.
When asked in an exclusive interview to explain why she was quitting, Lockyer, who celebrates her 41st birthday Saturday, paused for a moment, tears welling in her eyes, and told this newspaper: "I'm resigning today as a mother, and as ... I don't like to say the word 'victim,' but as somebody that didn't realize how difficult it would be to heal from what I went through the last year."

The Young Rascals formed in 1965 in Garfield, N.J. by Felix Cavaliere (keyboard, vocals), Eddie Brigati (vocals) and Gene Cornish (guitar) — all formerly of Joey Dee and the Starliters — and Dino Danelli (drums). They built their sound on the Hammond B-3 organ and soulful vocals and set the standard for blue-eyed soul — a term that was used to describe R&B and soul music performed by white artists — in the mid-1960s.

The former Massachusetts governor has struggled for much of his primary campaign to excite most conservative voters. Aiming at that group, he described himself as a "severely conservative" Republican governor while speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington in February.
Then, too, the words - spoken sometimes by the dancers and sometimes heard in recorded interviews backed by original music - have resonance but not necessarily rhythm. When Dorsey rails about lack of love or pouts at an unseen psychiatrist, the comedy routine feels suddenly too broad and literal, and the natural lyricism that Dorsey builds in tender duets and interlacing quartets skids into cartoonish territory.
McKenzie fired former college scouting director Jon Kingdom after 33 years on Monday.

Gillespie's Map Room, tucked into a long, narrow space along West Ninth Street, bills itself as "your neighborhood pub." That's true, given its proximity to the plethora of apartments and condos bordering the east bank of the Flats. Drinkers on my two visits wore jeans, khakis and shorts and appeared to have dropped in to meet friends, catch a ballgame, and kibitz with the staff. They were young and old.
The two buildings would attract notice anywhere, since they're by internationally renowned architects who aren't afraid to design structures like nothing you've ever seen. But they're especially startling in San Francisco -- where it sometimes seems that modern architecture is the last taboo.
The appeals court said the contract in question could be read many different ways, and a jury should have heard arguments from both sides on whether or not there was a violation.
Digital-focused media first leaped into the Pulitzer winner's circle last year when ProPublica won the national reporting prize.

Election picture: Cleveland's photo enforcement program just began its seventh year. A drive to end the program is about to enter its second. A group circulating petitions to challenge the city's use of traffic cameras remains far short of signatures to push the issue before voters. The effort won't get much closer in 2012, either, as it is "on hiatus" at the moment, said organizer Maryanne Petranek of Cuyahoga County for Liberty. She emphasized the campaign -- which began in April 2010 -- is not over.

To pretend that natural gas is a cure-all would be foolish. The methane problem illustrates why clean energy development and global warming are so complicated that there’s no single energy source that is sufficient to do the job. We will need an all-of-the-above energy strategy.
"If that's all I had in my hockey career, that would be awesome," Elliott said. "But when somebody sees something in you, you want to prove them right.

Rather than accentuate the positive, especially when reporting economic news, media seems bent on negating the positive rather than eliminating the negative. There seems to be a necessity to always include a but, much as one local radio personality likes to note, "there is always a 'however' in life."
As of Tuesday, however, the issue had not been sent to the secretary of state because Republicans had not yet submitted their position statement, said board Director Jane Platten.

Linfield 24, Cal Lutheran 14: Josh Hill scored two touchdowns and ran for 164 yards to lead the No. 7 Wildcats to a season-opening win in a game matching nationally-ranked Division III schools. Hill’s 3-yard run late in the third quarter back Linfield (1-0) a 17-7 lead. The Wildcats put the game away midway through the fourth on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Mickey Inns to Jacob Priester. Cal Lutheran (0-1) handed the Wildcats their only regular season loss in 2010.
Michael Spurgeon, the city's director of administration, told the Journal's Russell Korando that Mayor Sally Faith would review Kelly's claim and make a decision.

Lexi Thompson's last-round Alabama collapse a year ago could be a painful memory. Instead, the talented Florida teenager turned it into a growth experience.
Some civil liberties and privacy groups are also opposing the bill. They object not only to the immunity provision but to what they consider the weakening of the FISA court's oversight of government eavesdropping. For example, the government can initiate a wiretap without court permission if "important intelligence" would otherwise be lost. It has a week to file the request for approval with the court, and the court has 30 days to act on it. But if the court objects to how the government is carrying out the wiretap, it could be weeks before those methods are changed or stopped.
In the dissenting opinion, Chief Judge Robert M. Bell said the "communication device" that is tapped must be physically in the state; otherwise, "Its reach could be anywhere in the United States and, indeed, the world."

Don't worry about the Hollywood Walk of Fame — you'll cover it in the course of meandering among other sites. But for the record, its 2,400-plus terrazzo stars, the first of which were laid in 1960, now cover 15 blocks of Hollywood Boulevard and a few neighboring streets too. To see who's where, check projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk. As for the emblematic Grauman's Chinese Theatre (6925 Hollywood Blvd.), by all means browse the names and handprints, but be careful with your camera. Celebrity impersonators swarm here, some charming, some not, and they'll be quick to ask for a dollar tip if you snap a picture that includes them. You'll see that Starline Tours, the 800-pound gorilla of the Hollywood and homes-of-the-stars bus tour business, has a kiosk in front of Grauman's. Maybe you can't bring yourself to do such a tourist thing yourself, but maybe you have a friend. Send that friend on a Monday or Tuesday to catch the hourlong double-decker bus tour with guide Brian Donnelly, who has quick wit, good facts and a lot of them. (Donnelly also works for Dearly Departed Tours, specializing in crime scenes and celebrity graves.) Elsewhere on Hollywood Boulevard, brace yourself for residual squalor, T-shirt emporiums, vendors of cheap suits, and enough trashy lingerie shops to outfit all the ex-wives of Hugh Hefner and Charlie Sheen. You'll surely come across industrial-size tourist attractions Tussauds, Ripley and Guinness (all within five blocks of Hollywood & Highland). It's a relief to spot an independent such as the Larry Edmunds Bookshop (6644 Hollywood Blvd.), where the proprietor keeps about 1,000 old movie posters behind the counter, folded and filed in ancient manila folders.
Charles van Ravenswaay, director of the Missouri Historical Society, campaigned to save the building. The St. Louis Star-Times newspaper managed to delay demolition.

Kaptur, who knew she had no shot at stealing Kucinich's home field endorsement, treated the event with deference.

If the government sells the maximum number of shares allowed, its stake in GM would fall to about 41 percent. The government's remaining shares would be worth about $20 billion, still about $10 billion short of completely repaying taxpayers for the bailout.

"I could see it wasn't normal," Gloria Dunlap said.
Critics point to studies by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is funded by car insurance companies to research ways to reduce crashes, that show traffic safety has not improved in states with bans. They also suggest bans are difficult to enforce; what if the driver is reading a message, or searching for a number? Doesn't that also take eyes off the road?

A: After years of Edwards saying he had no knowledge of the cover up, prosecutors introduced phone records, voicemails and other evidence showing he was in frequent contact with Baron, Young and Hunter, all while his mistress was in hiding. Former members of Edwards' campaign also testified that Baron spoke of "moving Hunter around" in the candidate's presence and that Edwards told his speechwriter he knew "all along" what Baron was up to. However, in 14 days of testimony no witness ever said Edwards knew he was violating campaign finance laws, a key element of criminal intent the government must prove to win a conviction.

Only now sophomore Jared Sullinger, who is unquestionably the best interior player and arguably the best overall player in America, has a year of experience under his belt, and in the offseason shed some of the baby fat that slowed him down at times last year. And senior Will Buford, who was the best all-around offensive player on the team last year but had to frequently defer to Diebler and Lighty, will be a stud when he's given the freedom that he's wanted for so long. Sophomore Aaron Craft, who is essentially a slightly less talented but slightly headier Mike Conley, will thrive in his first season as a full-time starter after using last season to get his feet wet a little bit. And sophomore Deshaun Thomas — who is basically Ohio State's secret weapon and will become the most polarizing OSU basketball player ever among Buckeye fans within the first 10 games of the season because of his refusal to pass (most OSU fans don't exactly like what they've seen from Thomas so far, but he's already my favorite Ohio State player of all time, and I don't say that as hyperbole) — will finally get to prove that he's got the potential to be the best natural scorer Ohio State has seen in a long time.

Up close, the place is a rickety mess. Broken glass and chipped paint cover the floors. Walls and ceilings are stained brown with water damage. As wood pilings rot, the southeast corner is slowly falling into the Willamette River. Tight corners and basement levels reek with the astringent, eye-watering smells of mildew and a toxic, flammable chemical used in grain processing. Vagrants, graffiti artists and drug addicts routinely break in and leave trash behind, despite motion detectors and the nearby presence of the Portland Police Bureau's Mounted Patrol Unit. Dust coats every surface, and spider webs cling to every doorway and window. All the left-behind grain attracted a small army of animals, as a PDC spokesman who toured with us discovered the hard way when a rat scurried out of a dark corner and bumped into his shoes on its sprint to safety.
A report released in May by Financial Engines, an independent investment advice firm, found that 33% of eligible employees fail to contribute enough to their retirement plans to receive the full company match.
A. The first time they dropped us, I couldn't stand on my own. My legs were shaking so much. I realized that it wasn't going to be the leaping that would kill me; it was going to be the adrenalin spiking that would kill me. Taylor didn't have that problem. He's a hockey player so he's used to the action.

"I fully intend to introduce legislation that addresses the 'communication gap' that allowed an illegal alien charged with a violent crime against a child to evade American justice," Frelinghuysen said in a statement.

"Darron was a great example of really being tough and taking that quarterback position as a job," Bennett said. "He showed me that I needed to watch a lot of film and understand what's going on out there, and to be tough out there. That's one thing Darron always did, he stood in the pocket and made throws and took hits and he always got back up."
"I put a lot of pressure on myself," she said. "I probably shouldn't; I'm trying to stop doing that. I'm trying to make my times better and better, and whenever I don't get the times I want I get upset. I've been trying not to do that as much because it's going to get me down.
The team also provided details of the hundreds of thousands of dollars it has spent on such things as eyeglasses for poor kids and ballfield improvements at inner-city schools and recreation centers. I can't quibble with these donations but others do, arguing that such a wealthy organization can easily do more over the course of 30 years.

Sadly, Paige's memory isn't the only thing gone missing in "The Vow." There are close-up kisses to be sure, a nice shot of naked bodies in tangled sheets, a nearly naked dip in the lake, a wedding video filled with lots of hints at bliss, but no heart-racing, pulse-pounding passion to speak of.

Some like to point to the great work that the Maryland Food Bank and local pantries and shelters are doing to suggest that hunger is better solved by charity at the community level. Speaking from the front lines, charity cannot do it alone. Hunger is a national problem, and it is needs a national solution, and that starts with a strong federal commitment to programs like SNAP.
By the time they scraped their way into the postseason, the Capitals were grounded in their game. Washington has been at its most consistent under Hunter in this series. The violent swings in the team's ability to execute that dotted the regular season are all but absent, enabling the Capitals to weather the emotional flux of the playoffs with relative ease.

But if you are a Mets fan? If you are a real Mets fan who realizes that you do not swap your devotions in lean times and abandon them in hard times, who will go to Citi Field this year because the thought of not going is anathema, who will follow every game no matter where the roller coaster ride of 162 games brings you?

Greg Wyshynski, Yahoo! Sports: "There's no sugar-coating what a massive disappointment this season was for the Sharks. GM Doug Wilson made aggressive moves that were intended to turn a conference contender into a Cup champion; instead, they needed the final week of the season to make the cut and went out in one round. Instead, it's another playoff series in which regular-season scoring leaders wear a cloak of invisibility in the playoffs. McLellan's probably toast. I hate to say it and I'll hate to see it, because I think he's a good coach, but I can't imagine he survives this. The Sharks have 14 players under contract for next season, many at a significant salary. It'll be easy to swap out the coach than it'll be to blow up the core, and then hope the change in voice sparks the team. Niemi is signed through 2015, but they need to address the position. Maybe you package him in a Hail Mary trade for a star veteran netminder (paging Ryan Miller), attempting to shore up what's been one of the shakiest aspects of the 2011-12 Sharks. For a team that doesn't exactly exude confidence in the postseason, Niemi inspires little on his own."

Seton Hall's last poll appearance of any kind, came on Jan. 30, 2001 — when the Pirates were ranked No. 22. That year the team started off ranked No. 10 in the country and began 10-3. But after a fight in the locker room between players Ty Shine and freshman sensation, Eddie Griffin, the Pirates took a nosedive. Seton Hall would lose seven of its next eight games and finish the year at 16-15.

That's what happened to Ron Meyers, who spent $5,400 for two PSLs at the Charlotte Panthers' new stadium in the mid-1990s. The team's performance "went into the toilet," and he ended up selling the PSLs for a $400 loss, he said.
Palin was obviously contending that the rights of detainees -- including, judging from the larger context, the right not to be subjected to harrowing pain in the quest for intelligence -- were of little concern in the fight against terrorism. And now, here come new polling data showing that a solid majority of white evangelicals in the South, unlike the American population at large, believes torture is justified in the interest of extracting important information.
"We've kicked that around. I don't know what the true advantage is at this point to go early. We'll see. We're focused right now on picking the guys. That stuff will take care of itself," Grigson stressed.

Experts on both sides of the issue say the Supreme Court will most likely declare as constitutional the section of SB 1070 stating that during any "stop, detention or arrest," law enforcement must try to determine, when practicable, an individual's immigration status if the officer has reasonable suspicion that the person may be in the U.S. illegally.

When the Supreme Court takes up the 2010 healthcare reform law this week, the legal and political arguments will be in near-perfect alignment. And the stakes couldn't be higher on either front. The court briefs echo the themes that President Obama's Republican rivals are sounding on the campaign trail: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which they derisively call "Obamacare," is an attack on freedom, epitomizing the administration's disregard for constitutional limits on federal power and disrespect for citizens' rights to make decisions for themselves.
The new system, which goes into effect July 1, does not replace an existing Oregon program that offers state tax credits and cash incentives for installing solar equipment.

Consumers pay discount points when a loan is offered, supposedly in exchange for a lower rate on the mortgage. The points can benefit consumers by allowing them to reduce their monthly loan payments, the CFPB said.
A check this week showed the gate to Little Basin was open, but United and Wolf are required to operate the facility separately from state park day-use protocols and cannot permit come-and-go day use like a typical park unit.

The goal makes more sense if the president includes hybrid vehicles, which can be plugged in and run for short distances on electric power.
Obama discussed energy policy in March at an OSU appearance billed as an official White House visit.

Bailey announced Clark County’s preliminary July unemployment rate Tuesday as 10.1 percent, a figure he expects to jump into the twelves once it’s updated — as June’s level did at a revised 12.3 percent, up from an initial 9.9 percent. Again, however, these figures aren’t seasonally adjusted, making them difficult to compare to standard numbers.
I prefer to think of our accumulated stuff as either harmless, enjoyable entertainment - as in hobby collectibles and our 17 boxes of Christmas decorations - or practical, common-sense acquisitions.
But most baseball players caught in the steroids web are dense, naïve and arrogant. Slugger Manny Ramirez just flunked a second drug test and retired in shame; he didn't learn a damned thing. Understand that athletes that are determined to cheat and gain an unfair advantage never seem to think that they'll be discovered. And they'll keep trying to rig the system. This Bonds business won't alter that. Again: this case wasn't about doping; it was about telling lies.
On the other extreme, the beef cheek and oxtail burger ($15) was so rich it could have been foie gras; horseradish and vegetable pickles helped to cut it.

Engineers with the commission had cited "deficiencies" in the method that a PG&E contractor used to test the station over the summer to see whether it had been damaged by the overpressurization.

The tone for the album is set by the Dylanesque protest folk of Andrew Jackson Jihad, and the comp goes on to feature tracks by rapper Willy Northpole, whose "Back to Mexico (SB 1070 Dis)" includes the line "It's like Bill O'Reilly just wrote the Bill of Rights," and Peachcake, whose "A Soundtrack to the Revolution!" takes the debate out for a night of dancing.
