Other activities like going for a jog or even doing a crazy dance around the bathroom can you help to create a mental shift and avoid a meltdown.

Based on an 1891 play by Frank Wedekind that was subtitled "A Children's Tragedy" and often banned for its dark content, the rock-fueled adaptation focuses on a trio of ill-fated friends undone by the bad blend of surging hormones and a suppressive society. Despite keeping the original 19th-century setting, the show blasts into modernity with energetic songs that communicate the mystifying, inchoate emotions and impulses of puberty. And the play as a whole doesn't shy from frank language, rebellious attitudes and sexual situations.

Factory orders fall - Demand for U.S. factory goods dropped in March by the most in three years, driven lower by a sharp fall in volatile orders for commercial aircraft. Still, more recent data suggest the decline may be temporary. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that orders for factory goods fell 1.5 percent.

A key reason for the drop was aircraft orders plummeted nearly 50 percent. Those orders can fluctuate sharply from month to month. Excluding transportation goods, orders were unchanged. Demand for less durable items, such as food, chemicals and gasoline, rose 0.5 percent.

Brian Gordon of MAGA LTC (800-533-6242), an agency that deals solely with LTC insurance, says that one of his clients who received a 75 percent premium increase was able to maintain the current premium by reducing the inflation protection from 5 percent compounded to 2.7 percent. Her original coverage at time of purchase was $6,200 per month. But the inflation protection had already increased the benefit to $9,620 per month over the preceding years. Using this strategy, future inflation coverage would be limited from this higher base, but premiums would remain unchanged.

We also avoid speaking of sin because we lack the skills to practice forgiveness. True forgiveness is tough and demanding. As Barbara Brown Taylor observed in her book "Speaking of Sin," most of us love the image of the father in the parable of the prodigal son.

Martha Reeves has changed her dress, like the good diva she is, but it's still more senior citizen boobage than I want to see. She's singing "Jimmy Mack". This is a very peppy foxtrot, and I think someone, probably Len, is going to ding them for it not being smooth enough, because there are definitely some steps that look rough to my eye. Bruno said it was sophisticated and elegant, but mentions the lost footing and subsequent missed choreography.

And when he has to, Wilson can run, having gained 320 yards rushing with five scores.

Pagels' new book, "Revelations," examines a far more familiar text, but it offers revelations of its own for lay readers. Suspiciously slim for such a complex and fraught subject, this five-chapter book whisks us through centuries of religious conflict, ecclesiastical maneuvering and textual scholarship. It's easy to imagine that Pagels' obscure academic competitors say mean things about her behind her back — How dare she be so accessible! — but she's one of those rare scholars who can speak fluently to other professors or to curious people who decide on a whim to learn something about the Bible. Forty-six pages — the longest section of her book — are given over to footnotes that direct students to more technical explorations of these issues. Lay readers, meanwhile, will take this book and eat it up.

Second, several readers wrote to suggest that both the Brown and Munger initiatives are doomed because they require a two-thirds vote of the people, and neither is polling above that threshold. That, too, is wrong. Although one reader thoughtfully included an excerpt from the California Constitution, the reader apparently didn’t read it too closely. It states: "From and after the effective date of this article, any changes in State taxes enacted for the purpose of increasing revenues collected pursuant thereto whether by increased rates or changes in methods of computation must be imposed by an Act passed by not less than two-thirds of all members elected to each of the two houses of the Legislature .... " That’s the provision of Proposition 13 that requires legislative tax increases to win a two-thirds majority in the state Legislature. But these are being submitted to the voters, where a simple majority can secure approval.

The questions he asked Favre were "inside" football stuff. What was his "hot" read on a play bust or a "hurry"? Out of certain formations, could he call an audible against a shifting front?

So now what? No one really seems sure. Burton relies on anachronistic humor -- Barnabas not understanding the world he's been released in -- to somewhat good effect, mostly because Depp is good at that sort of thing. But a little goes a long way, and you can't build a whole movie on it. It's probably silly to complain about lack of character development in a campy movie based on a soap opera, but other than Barnabas and Angelique, the other characters just sort of come and go, popping up every now and then as needed, nothing more.

I think social networking sites, like Facebook, have made me feel much more connected to friends and family I don't get to see or talk to frequently. I think it would certainly ease the new parenthood transition. But, one of the best ways to make new mommy friends is to sign up for mom-and-me classes, either through the school district's early childhood education program or through private classes. See who your child plays nicely with and invite the mom and kid over for a playdate. I've made lasting friendships with other moms that way.

Lastly, the taking of money from the retirement-related Trust Fund to balance the 2012 budget. This trust fund, mandated by the state, was set up to pay partial costs of employees who retire for unused sick days. Although many in the private sector may cringe at this topic, the facts are it is where we are right now. Measures to reform this on the state level are applauded by all of us, however again it is mandated by the state to fund this trust. To take this money from the trust is questionable at best. Our question to this resolution, besides the fact that we received it 24 hours prior to the vote, concerns the setting of a practice wherein we balance the current budget cycle on the backs of our future fiscal strength.

After that, we still have to cover the western U.S., plus Japan, Australia, New Zealand -- the Pacific Rim -- but when it finally does end, I will probably record another solo album or two. There are a couple of projects in my head that I'd like to get done before I hang it up altogether. There are currently no plans for any future Eagles projects beyond this world tour. I'd say the chances of us making another album together are 50-50.

Thanks James, well, in keeping with the last question a bit, I do think Joe Sacco saw a little too much of what you saw in Mueller as well. Mueller should have been a prime guy to score goals down the stretch, but he saw himself in the doghouse suddenly and it seemed to affect his mood a bit too.

A surprisingly canny politician, Sihanouk led his country to independence from the French in 1953 and sought to maintain its neutrality while war raged in Vietnam, winking at the use of border regions by communist guerrillas and the dispatch of American B-52s to eradicate them.

Condoleezza Rice's name has been floated, and she'd be a swell pick if Romney wants to re-litigate the Bush regime's disaster in Iraq. Paul Ryan, the House conservative hero, would be ideal if Romney wants to devote his time to defending a budget plan that would balance the books on the backs of the elderly and basically touch every third rail in American politics. And Rick Santorum would be fabulous if Romney's aim is to drive independent swing-voters to Barack Obama.

The primary campaign may have been long and tough, but it proved the Romney forces had the depth and skill to crush the opposition at the key junctures in the primary season and has what it takes for a serious challenge to President Obama's powerful operation. During the New Hampshire primary, Romney voter research was able to predict voter behavior based on such things as the kind of car a voter owned or where his kids went to school. That level of pinpoint marketing could be a potent tool in winnowing the ranks of undecided voters in the swing states.

"No, absolutely not, ever," she said emphatically, too emphatically, as if trying to convince herself as well as the audience. When her mother, a dour but concerned woman, grilled her on the subject, the Octomom went ballistic with her denials. "Child Protective Services is on my side!" she said, incredibly.

Stanford had made virtually the same move after the 2010 season when Jim Harbaugh left and the school named eager assistant coach David Shaw, then 38 years old, as Harbaugh's successor. Shaw then led the Cardinal to an appearance in the BCS's Fiesta Bowl.

"I just came out there and hit it," Hostetler said. "It just was perfect. It felt like I didn't use my arm at all. It seemed to just not want to drop. I knew from the second I threw it, it was big. I didn't know how big."

In other, far more boring, storylines, Albie Manzo meets with his lawyer to discuss getting shown the door at Seton Hall Law School. Apparently after getting dismissed from law school, you have to wait two years before applying anywhere else, and Albie doesn't want to wait. The lawyer says it looks like Seton Hall didn't give him the help he requested, so they should ask the school for a letter that allows him to apply elsewhere.

Fish stew ($18) resembling a New Age bouillabaisse is also baked in the oven. The base is made with leeks, onions and fennel sweated with saffron and other spices to form a thick paste. To that, Jossel adds white wine, fish fumet, tomatoes, braised fennel, potatoes and various fish such as rock cod, halibut, sturgeon and calamari. The stew is heaped into a large bowl and served with a large grilled crouton. The portion looks so generous you'd swear you couldn't possibly finish it, but before long you're looking at an empty bowl wanting more.

Then he watched with concern when the lockout ended and the open season began for general managers. With teams signing rookies and free agents all at once, several veterans like Blackburn were left without a destination. The Giants locked up three rookie linebackers, all with a cheaper price tag.

This continues to be one of the best rivalries in women's college basketball, something made even more entertaining this year because of the combating philosophies between Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw and Connecticut's Geno Auriemma. This will be the eighth time in 16 months that the two teams have played and the reason we're giving the Huskies the edge is because defensive teams tend to thrive in these situations. UConn has the best defense in the country and Notre Dame has the second-best offense. And although the Irish have more firepower, it's tough to slight someone like Auriemma, who prepares better than any coach in the tournament and who knows McGraw and her tendencies better than anyone else. Of course, that's not to take anything away from what Skylar Diggins and Co. have accomplished this year. Their best chance to win will be to start fast and force Connecticut to adjust early and often.

(Don't process too much or it will become watery.) Add more salt, pepper or lemon juice to taste if needed. Set aside. Dressing can be made 1 day in advance, refrigerated.

Meanwhile, rinse the rice well in several changes of water until water runs clear. Add the rice to the pot. Bring back to a boil, stirring occasionally. Add the ginger. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. (Low heat and stirring are important to avoid scorching as the jook thickens.)
