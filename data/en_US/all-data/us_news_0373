All this meticulous audience-tailoring aside, what makes "The Secret World of Arrietty" transporting in this country is the same thing that made it succeed in Japan: the film's ability to create a special and marvelous world for audiences to enter.

If that sounds like a dramatic cliché, rest assured that nothing in this film feels familiar, or predictable. Nor does the drama need to draw us in. It's the special magic of the director, Susanne Bier, who wrote the script with Anders Thomas Jensen, that we're in the midst of things from the very beginning, and, like the film's characters, taking our cues from fleeting glances and odd gestures, or facing great explosions of rage, grief and love.

I believe preachers ought to be prophets to culture, but I'm the type of prophet that's more apt to "whisper" truth in a tender way than scream it from the mountaintops lest my voice crowd out the quiet voice of the Holy Spirit. I believe Jesus is the only way to heaven, but I've had really wonderful, delightful conversations with Hindus and Buddhists in the Himalayan hometown of the Dalai Lama and in India's enshrined city of Varanasi. In fact, I prefer the generosity and hospitality of Muslims over many stuffy, reclusive evangelicals I've met, and I actually think that Jesus was a pretty nice guy who'd like us to follow Him and His example of loving others rather than erecting barrier after barrier of disagreement that divide us from Him. We sometimes call those barriers, religion. After all, as we were reminded in a recent popular book, those who follow Jesus "come from every system that exists."

It also was a trash-strewn city with a topography-defying grid of narrow streets and a notoriously licentious reputation. Political boss Abe Ruef pulled the strings of power while the well-to-do fumed because the city lacked the sort of gracious boulevards and public buildings that captivated them on visits to Europe. Or, for that matter, any sort of coherent long-term plans for transportation and the city infrastructure.
Still, there's pleasure to be found in this novel. It's set in Los Angeles, and Koo Davis embodies the hypocrisies and absurdities of show business. The absurdities of political radicals, however, make no sense to him; he thinks they're all nuts. The five kidnappers are nicely drawn. Peter imagines himself commander of the People's Revolutionary Army; Larry dreams of a workers' paradise and knows nothing of the world as it is; violence-prone Mark is ready to kill Davis to make a revolutionary statement. Of the two women, embittered Liz is given to LSD and casual sex, and Joyce is simply a lost soul. Yet before the story ends, each will surprise us.

"I dug deep and told my story, warts and all. That's a nervous-making thing," Lithgow says. "I think I'm a little bit hard on myself, in retrospect, but I would rather be harder on myself than other people. I don't really see any point in defaming other people."

The Volt obviously hasn't caught on with many ordinary Americans or Joe Sixpack. It's not exactly a muscle car. And the Toyota Prius, at about $20,000, is a better value. This would explain why GM decided to shut down its Detroit production line for five weeks after selling only 7,600 Volts in 2011, well short of its goal of 10,000.

"The Bourne Legacy": Matt Damon's Jason Bourne is out of the picture. Jeremy Renner plays a different CIA agent. Renner ("The Hurt Locker"), like Damon, always gives good performances. Director Tony Gilroy wrote the previous "Bourne" movies and directed "Michael Clayton." So those are pretty good credentials, if any credentials can be believed in the "Bourne" world. Aug. 3

An increase in the rate of economic expansion — estimated at nearly 3 percent in the final three months of last year — has given rise to the improvement.

Even if Mr. Santorum had pulled off a massive upset in Wisconsin, Mr. Romney was certain to increase his advantage in the delegate count after Tuesday's voting. Based on the results so far, it appears that the night was disastrous to Mr. Santorum's hopes of checking the Romney advance. Mr. Romney swept all of the delegates awarded in Maryalnd and Washington, and appears likely to come close to repeating the feat in Wisconsin. Even before all the results were in Tuesday, New York Times elections statistics guru Nate Silver had pegged Mr. Romney to have a 96 percent chance to clinch the nomination before the GOP convention. At a time when national polls are swinging Mr. Romney's way, Mr. Santorum would have to nearly run the table in the remaining contests to get the 1,144 delegates needed to win the nomination outright, and he would need to significantly outperform his results so far to prevent Mr. Romney from doing so.

HIGH POINTS: Any device with wireless capability can connect to the Internet at the same time — no need to purchase a USB cellular modem for every member of the family. I had five devices connected at the same time without encountering any issue. The router can be set in a spot with the strongest connection signal, while you are free to move around with your wireless device (the range covered more than 200 feet during my test). The lithium-ion battery allows for use in the car, too. The router is lightweight and comes with a soft carrying case, Ethernet cable and power adapter.

As a bill legalizing same-sex marriage in New jersey winds its way through the Legislature – today the Assembly votes on it – Gov. Chris Christie still wants to put the issue to a popular vote.

Come on, he was a finalist in 2000. But that's my point. As we indulge - lo, these next four months - in the inevitable running-mate parlor game, let's remember that 95 percent of the speculation is wasteful, and that the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the umpteen prospects may well be ephemeral. Still, let's not kid ourselves. The game is fun.

The Democrats were the first to buy him off, back in January, granting him a high-ranking leadership post to keep him from flipping to the GOP. Then, on June 8, the Republicans lured him to their side by making him temporary president of the Senate - and next in line to be governor. Finally, and unbelievably, the same Democrats who had flayed Espada as a turncoat took him back, making him their second in command.

Some games he scores, some games he doesn't, but their whole thing runs through Cooper."
The FEC decided last week not to appeal, but two independent groups are seeking to have the ruling overturned.

Many cleaners include chemicals that release VOC's (volatile organic compounds) into your indoor air. In most homes, VOC's are two to five times higher than outdoor air, and can be up to 25 times higher in cabinets where cleaning products are kept. According to the Minnesota Department of Health, "The best health protection measure is to limit your exposure to products and materials that contain VOCs when possible." In the short-term, VOC's can make asthma worse, irritate the eyes and throat, and can cause headaches and dizziness. Long-term effects include liver and kidney damage, and VOC's are considered carcinogens. Switch to natural brands, especially for those cleaning products that you use regularly, like countertop sprays and bathroom scrubs.

Positively Cleveland has created some conservative projections for the convention center. From 2005 to 2009, conventions and meetings filled an average of 153,000 rooms each year. Only 10 to 15 percent of those were tied to the convention center. The visitors' bureau predicted that a new facility would increase traffic by 25 percent in its first year and by 5 percent annually during the subsequent five years.

That didn't really happen, but updates of the "new communities" law helped -- via a New Community District -- to turn the Columbus suburb of New Albany into the boom town it now is.

I have good reason to believe the description of Wolves forward Kevin Love's injury as a "mild concussion" is closer to a normal concussion that could keep him out of action for the rest of the season. The word is that the neck injury he suffered at the same time when he caught an elbow to the face is not a problem.

"It shows some attempt to be innovative," said Dan Hurley, director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Assn. of State Colleges and Universities.

Clearly, Robert Caro hasn't. "The Passage to Power," the fourth in "The Years of Lyndon Johnson" series, reaffirms our faith in this eloquent chronicler of American history as reflected in the life of Lyndon Johnson of Johnson City, Texas, the 36th president of the United States. The latest volume covers the shortest span of Caro's endeavor -- just more than four years from Johnson's awkward stumbles seeking the 1960 Democratic Party nomination for president to the tumultuous months following his ascent to the White House after the assassination of President John Kennedy.

Many of his females are menacing viragos with luxuriant pubic hair and, even more characteristically, bloated breasts. Fellini's reaction to such lewd witches and Rubenesque trollops seems an adolescent mixture of attraction and apprehension. Several scenes in which they feature are set on the Adriatic beaches of his adolescence. There are a few references to actresses, such as a sketch of his dream of making love to Anita Ekberg. A significant sketch is set in a Chinese castle where he dreamed of being "a prisoner of skilled prostitutes -- sadistic in the extreme" who "set on him like hungry wolves." A friend warns him to flee to avoid being eaten alive, but instead he goes on "dueling " with his assailants. Several sketches are scatological. "The Book of Dreams" also has more than 100 caricatures of celebrities, among them Henry Kissinger, Fellini's beloved Pope John XXIII, Ingmar Bergman, Orson Welles, Salvador Dali and Sophia Loren. Some were not even acquaintances: Jimmy Carter, portrayed saying, "Jesus." Fellini succeeded in making several caricatures that were both recognizable and a commentary on the subject.

But as the election nears, interest groups are also trying to reach voters in other, less visible ways, including phone calls, mailings and door-to-door visits. Nonparty groups had devoted at least $27 million to that ground game from Labor Day to the week before the election.

Escalating rental rates are also designed to encourage faster exploration and development.

As part of the City Beautiful movement, Chicago architect Daniel Burnham arrived in San Francisco in 1904 to design a Civic Center that would turn San Francisco into a glamorous Paris. Wide boulevards would radiate out from City Hall like the Champs-Élysée from the Arc de Triomphe. In the 1906 quake, City Hall conveniently tumbled down, allowing planners to start from scratch. Opened in 1915, the new City Hall, designed by Arthur Brown Jr. of Bakewell & Brown, is considered one of the nation's finest Beaux Arts structures. Its imposing sandstone and marble dome, modeled after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, is higher than the U.S. Capitol in Washington.

Los Angeles County residents look into their magic mirrors and see a humane and enlightened region with pragmatic criminal justice laws, unlike those backward, supposedly execution-crazy folks in places like Texas.
