Television commercials featuring celebrities like Sally Field and Blythe Danner endorsing osteoporosis medications can mislead people into thinking that osteoporosis only affects post-menopausal women. And while it is true that women are more likely to develop osteoporosis, many men are at risk as well. In fact, men account for 20 percent of osteoporosis cases. You may also be surprised to learn that osteoporosis can occur in almost any person, at any age.

Right now, we have about 2,800 officers in Detroit. That's about average for cities of our population, but when you consider the city's land mass, at nearly 140 square miles, the police presence seems much thinner. I'm convinced that is part of the reason response times are so slow -- along with the continued inefficiencies in deployment, which is getting better. But DPD still has too many officers not on patrol and too much patrol time taken up dealing with antiquated equipment and procedures.
We live in a very diverse country, not just racially, but in terms of class. Twenty percent of the people in this state are on Medicaid. If you went 20 miles from here on the east side of Detroit, you would find hundreds or thousands of people who grew up in an entirely different world than you did.
This year, the Republican primary debate has clearly taken its toll.

All in all, you wouldn't know that Europe has suffered through an economic crisis as brutal as ours, because strong social programs in the social democracies we love to visit — England, Italy and France — keep people at work, which is part of the problem. Governments that don't have the resources to pay for such programs — Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain — have needed bailouts from neighbors, generating ill will and doomsday scenarios about the impending collapse of the European Union. If you think that's of marginal interest to tourists, you've forgotten what it was like to travel on the Continent before the advent of open borders and a single currency.

"If you start hitting from the 3-point arc, you can score a lot of points in a hurry," Collinsville coach Darin Lee said. "I was disappointed we didn't defend them a little better, but they did that to us the last game. They're a streaky team -- they put a 19-0 run on O'Fallon."

The view would have been enough, but the tower gained another dimension in 1934, when its ground floor was covered with murals by artists in the federally funded Public Works of Art Project. About 25 artists were paid about $31 a week, and the walls they left us amount to a portrait of the city 75 years ago: ferry commuters, fedoras, newspapers, high anxiety. And of course, the artists couldn't resist peppering the imagery with a little political spice -- notice the library denizen reaching for a volume by Karl Marx, and the copy of the Daily Worker high on the news rack display.

At preschool, school functions, soccer games and birthday parties, the working and at-home parents can often be found in their own corners, sometimes oblivious that they even are in their own corners.

The "wisdom of crowds" suggests that any group of people will make a better decision than that made by the single smartest person in the room. So why is such an important decision-making body missing about one-quarter of what could be its collective wisdom? It is true that a board is one step removed from the operating level of an organization, but the board ultimately makes decisions about who to hire in those roles. It establishes goals and determines the point at which management is failing.

It will be more than I can afford.

Surprise resident Anthony Cordeiro, 67, a retired oil-pipeline supervisor whose parents emigrated legally from the Atlantic islands the Azores in the early 1900s, said workplace enforcement is especially important because jobs draw illegal immigrants into the U.S., and businesses that hire them bear much of the blame for today's immigration problem.
Ever since the cult classic "Night of the Living Dead" was produced in 1968 by George Romero, there has been a growing fascination with portraying the walking dead in America.

In the bottom of the second, Freddie Freeman doubled off Dickey. As Juan Francisco stepped to the plate, rain pelted the diamond with greater frequency; precipitation is anathema to a quality knuckleball.

The primary purpose of applying the franchise tag – at least from the Ravens’ point of view – is to buy some time in order to negotiate a long-term extension with Rice and his agent, Todd France, while making sure that the standout running back can’t hit free agency. That remains the goal this offseason, to get the 25-year-old locked up on a long-term deal. In applying the franchise tag, the Ravens now have until July 16 to reach an agreement before Rice plays under the franchise tag for the 2012 campaign. Ravens’ officials met with France last week at the NFL Scouting Combine. Both sides seem to know that these negotiations are going to take a long time, and the talks will continue after Rice is tagged. The good news for Rice is that the Ravens have a history of using the tag as a precursor to signing the “franchised” player to long-term contract extensions. Terrell Suggs, Chris McAlister and Haloti Ngata all wore the franchise tag before getting a lucrative extension from the team. Will they do the same with Rice before July 16? That remains to be seen, but at least now they have the opportunity to get it done while knowing that their best offensive player isn’t going anywhere at least for one more season.

His attractiveness to most of the women in the audience is apparent and he knows how to use it, but does so with unaffectedness. Best of all, he clearly enjoys playing his music, and that joy spreads.

øBut the Nest isn't simply a thermostat that monitors and adjusts the temperature. It also measures things such as ambient light, humidity, and motion, ultimately using any information it gleans to fine-tune its program. If it detects that you're not home on, say, a Sunday afternoon, it adjusts accordingly, even if the standard program dictates otherwise. If you have multiple Nest units in your home, they will communicate via Wi-Fi to coordinate schedules for the different parts of your house.

“The referees have a hard job. They see it live. Definitely van Riemsdyk pushed my stick over when he came across,” Brodeur said. “He didn’t do it on purpose. He was going in front of the net and I had my position there. It prevented me from making the save. When it goes so quick like that for the referees, especially after disallowing one goal, they wouldn’t do that twice in Philly. That’s for sure.”

It's also possible that we evolved to nurse children until they're around 5 or 6, says Dettwyler. Breast milk is one of the only sources of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids that build brain tissue, she says. It isn't until age 5 or 6 that "95% of brain growth has been reached, and that's also about the time that the child's immune system is ramped up to full production," she says.
The first law, the "Peace Officers' Bill of Rights," was the brainchild of the Assembly's Criminal Justice Committee in the mid-seventies. At the time, stories circulated about police brass leaning on officers, their wives and their families, to get confessions.

* Or to put it another way: the enigmatic Chris Stewart, who (justifiably) has been criticized by media and fans for his inconsistent and indifferent ways, has played fewer minutes than any Blues' forward in this series. And he was a healthy scratch in Game 2. In 21:26 minutes of ice time, Stewart has 2 goals. And that's as many goals, by himself, as McDonald, Steen, Backes, Berglund, Oshie and Perron have for in approximately 341 combined miutes of ice time in this series. That's terrible.
Flanagan's second-place finish at the New York City Marathon on Nov. 7 -- in 2 hours, 28 minutes, 40 seconds -- nudged the bar for U.S. women a little higher. It was Flanagan's first marathon and she became the first U.S. woman in 20 years to place as high as second in New York.
Also, just about every computer you can buy today has built-in power management capabilities. Either you can put it to sleep, then when you want to wake it up it comes back very quickly, or you can set it to put itself to sleep after it’s been idle for, say, 15 minutes. If you don’t have your system go to sleep, or put it to sleep manually, it’s likely leaving a couple 100-watt light bulbs burning all the time, even when nobody’s around.

"I think it's also instructive that the place that the governor would sign this is at a political rally -- it might be an elegant political rally, but it is a 100 percent political event, and that speaks volumes about what this legislation was about from day one," said Bryan Howard, president of Planned Parenthood of Arizona. "But while the impetus for the governor is political, and for the sponsors it's political, the impact is on health care for poor Arizonans, and that is a terrible, terrible trade-off."

Morrison does not need to worry about recognition in her lifetime. Nobel judges have honored her, and so has Oprah Winfrey, whose book club picks have helped Morrison's novels sell millions. A Toni Morrison Society organizes conferences about her work and sponsors a Toni Morrison Book Prize. She not only has written children's stories, but has been the subject of one, Douglas Century's "Toni Morrison." Two presidential contenders, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, sought her support in 2008 and Obama will soon present her with a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the country's highest civilian honor. Her play "Desdemona," a collaboration with director Peter Sellars and the Malian singer-songwriter Rokia Traore, will be staged in London during the Summer Olympics.

So, a healthy Cutler should trigger improvement. And when he left, Martz took most plans for seven-step drops with him. The introduction of quarterbacks coach Jeremy Bates to the system likely will bring some elements that helped Cutler be successful for the Broncos with rollouts and moving pockets. Those wrinkles also should help against pressure just as the addition of a top-flight receiver in Brandon Marshall should.

Why do people with driveways park in the street? It's a two-lane street. It's busy enough without having all these cars parked. What good is a driveway if you don't park in it? What if an ambulance or fire truck had to come through the street with all those cars parked in the street? I don't understand why people who have a two-car driveway don't park on their driveway. It makes it very difficult to go down a street and have cars parked up and down on both sides. It's very difficult to get through. When people want to pull out of their driveway and a car is parked there, you can't even get out of the driveway. If you've got a garage, why don't you park in the garage? And if you've got more than one car, park the second car in the back of the garage door. But let's not be parking in the street. I think that's kind of ignorant.

In fact, officials in New Orleans have come to believe that the traditional notions of school reform -- switching to mayoral control, bringing in a star superintendent, enacting tougher laws, allocating more money -- ultimately will founder and fail. Kingsland, blogging this year on the Education Week website, sparked controversy by challenging superintendents of struggling school districts to relinquish their systems instead of trying endless reforms: "Rid yourself of the notion that your current opinions on curriculum, teacher evaluation, technology, or anything else will be the foundation for dramatic gains in student achievement. If history tells us anything, they will not be." Move away, he wrote, from a centralized bureaucracy and improve the quality and number of charter schools.

This pinot noir, which comes from the Negev in Israel, is a light- to medium-bodied, fresh and fruity red. It's easy to drink with soft tannins and delightful strawberry and black cherry flavors, making it a good choice for guests starting to drink drier wines. The Barkan Classic Pinot Noir, which is mevushal, has a 13 percent alcohol level and is best served slightly chilled.

The excellent-rated Waterloo schools are running out of things to cut after slicing $1 million from this school year's budget and, in recent years, trimming staff, negotiating pay and benefits concessions from staff and adding pay-to-play fees. In just two years, the percentage of students qualifying for free and reduced-price lunch has skyrocketed from 19 percent to nearly 34 percent. That speaks directly to why it will be hard for residents to swallow this level of property tax increase, but without it, the schools could falter.

We also got to peek into the other suite, the Cedar Loft, which is breathtakingly romantic. It's up several flights of stairs, in the topmost area of the barn. Just when you think you'll arrive in a cobwebby attic, a door opens to reveal a luxurious suite with a cozy bedroom, full bath and kitchen, all smartly furnished with antiques and with the same amazing view we had from the Cottage.

Here's a trick question: When is a plant's main attraction neither the flowers nor the foliage? In the case of the genus Arisaema, the spathe is the cause of both curiosity and wonder. The members of this wide-ranging genus, hailing from the Himalayas, China, Japan and even North America, are gradually making their way into Bay Area woodland gardens.

What's cool about it: "Smile" isn't just a "lost" album, it's a kind of existential one. No one (not even its creators) can tell you exactly what its official version should consist of. That's because genius/lunatic Brian Wilson never settled on the final selection of its tracks, some of which ended up on subsequent albums, and all of which have been out on scratchy bootleg versions for years. This set, made for true B.B. maniacs, will further complicate its strange history - which, naturally, will only add to its myth.

EHRs are working for the people of our region. Recently, Better Health Greater Cleveland released its latest Community Health Checkup, which provides a snapshot comparing the care provided in our community between July 2009 and June 2010 -- as a region and for each of the 48 medical practices that have collaborated to measure and improve the care of their patients with important chronic conditions. The results show that our region's EHR investment is paying off. For patients with diabetes, for example, 51 percent of those receiving care in an EHR practice received all the recommended care, as compared with 7 percent of those who received care in a paper-based practice. That's a remarkable 44 percentage-point difference. What's more, Better Health's analyses show that EHRs benefit everyone, including patients who are insured by Medicare, commercial health plans and Medicaid, and those who are uninsured.
