On my first run, when I (finally) passed the local school my first thought was: holy cow this is far away! And, although I’m house-sitting for a sustainable transport colleague, I couldn’t help but wonder if she (gasp!) drives her son to school.
2. Fright Night – Another one I wasn’t expecting to love near as much as I did. I wasn’t a diehard fan of the original Fright Night. In fact I only saw it a couple weeks before the remake. I was nonetheless wowed by how enjoyable the new version was. Colin Farrell was menacing as a vampire with a very rapist-like energy. David Tenant was ridiculously entertaining as a Vegas showman. Anton yelchin makes a relatable sort of everyman. Even Christopher Mintz-Plasse managed to work within his typecasting to create a memorable performance. And Imogen Poots is… just… damn… (someone with that name shouldn’t be hot, but there she is with her name-defying hotness)

Yes, my marathon running outfit. I would like to wear something that makes me feel great. Endurance events are a mental battle not just a physical one, and if there’s anything that I can do to add a bit more positivity to the day then I’m going to do it. So I’ve been having a look round a few websites, checking out the options. There’s some lovely kit out there and far more choice than when I was a middle distance running teenager. Here’s a few things I found on Sweatshop, my favourite running gear website:
Also, the character of Emilie is an interesting one, she gives the film a bit of heart and her horror and guilt as she realises that her life has been attributed more value than the other hostages is quite touching. She’s also quite a tough character, and while she may whine a bit at the start she’s a fairly strong female role as she gives as good as she gets with Snow and displays some grit and integrity. I liked that she refused to just be bossed about and fall into the trap of being a simple damsel in distress.
After we returned back to Bordeaux, I had to start school (more on that nightmare later). Before we knew it, it was time for Lauren to head back home and start her new semester too. It went by too quickly but we had a great time.
Neither the industrial nor agricultural collectivization was perfect – in fact, there were a number of problems (see the Siedman book linked below). But imperfection has hardly stopped us from accepting massively worse systems, such as the one that is in place now. I am fascinated by the positive aspects of the Spanish revolution, and it gives me hope that similar experiments might be possible today (probably in developing countries, which serve as the best approximations for 1930s Spain).

One of the best parts of all of the treat and gift giving this time of year is the packaging. Don't you agree? I've been heading to the post office just about every other day with happy mail I have been sending for Ruffled Sunshine and gifts I've been giving. Luckily I have a post office just down the road in the grocery store so I can skip the lines!
If you’re a fan of Dark Shadows, I recommend you stay away from this remake and continue to enjoy the series for what it was. And if you’re a devoted fan of Tim Burton, you may get a kick out of the film’s first half, if not much more

The key decision in a Quest Plot is: what are the characters questing for, and will they succeed in their mission? Once you’ve decided this, you’re golden. You can start at Point A and work your way merrily to Point B, and if things start to get slow? WHAM. NINJA ASSASSINS. Problem solved, my friend.
I created a new folder, named it 'digital images' and placed it in the 'pictures' folder. I now save all the digital stamps to that folder. Since I show my creations on my blog, I also add the name of the blog to the file so that I can give credit where credit is due.
I got in to crafting 4 years ago whilst I was recovering from an operation. I was forced to stay off work longer than I had expected and in a bid to avoid total cabin fever, I bought a card making magazine and got to work with the freebie bits on the front cover. From that day, I just haven't looked back. Whilst I'm pleased to report that my style and skill level has improved somewhat since those very early days, unfortunately, my bank balance really hasn't! I tend to produce unfussy clean designs and love bright and bold papers. I also adore my beloved Copic markers and now use them on every image that I colour. I can't wait to start using them on some new Redonkulous images!
My next stop was the American Philosophical Society, for obvious reason. (I’m a philosophy graduate.) Founded by Benjamin Franklin, over many years it had attracted some of America’s finest minds. It has also taken in many foreign intellectuals, Charles Darwin has even been a member and in the small gallery open to tourists there was an invitation to his funeral.
The committee also found that 59 case dockets went missing at the station. There were investigations initiated on the missing dockets, but it was not clear what would happen afterwards.

I like to be confident in my demands, especially to the boy who swears he never needs a jacket.
We’ve already seen where this path leads. It erodes freedom. It deadens the entrepreneurial spirit. And it hurts the very people it’s supposed to help. Those who promise to spread the wealth around only ever succeed in spreading poverty. Other nations have chosen that path. It leads to chronic high unemployment, crushing debt, and stagnant wages.
Would you ever hire such a person? Would you ever date them? Would you ever even talk to them? And would you, under any circumstances, and regardless of where you are on your own parenting journey, put that person in a position to actually be responsible for the well-being of anyone else, let alone a child? Of course you wouldn't. You would never tolerate it, would never even allow that kind of negativity into your life at all.
Here's the second spice mix in my series of homemade seasoning blends. The first one was Roasted Chicken Seasoning, which is actually a good all-purpose seasoning with poultry and pork. Now I've moved onto a fish seasoning for seafood. This is my version of Old Bay seasoning, which was inspired by an about.com recipe. I removed the salt-containing spices in their recipe and altered some of the proportions of some of the spices and/or herbs to my taste. I first used this when making some trout that I crusted with macadamia nuts. I won't be posting that recipe for now because it was one of those cases where is tasted a lot better than it looked. The nuts wouldn't stick to the fillets, so I scooped them out of the pan on top of each serving of fish. The taste was amazing, but the look left something to be desired. If I figure out a more manageable way to make that recipe that does not compromise the flavor, I will post it.

On our last day we went to Yo! Sushi while we were waiting for our train. I’m addicted to Sushi, if we had a restaurant in my town I’d never eat anywhere else! But we don’t, so it was a nice treat. I accidentally picked up two spicy dishes, oops! My favourite though was a crispy salmon skin roll, so so delicious!

This pink belt was the very first belt I bought after seeing belts in a blog. You can't totally tell from the photograph but it's pale pink and wide. I bunched the turtleneck dress up a bit to make my leg line look longer, yet still keep my torso long. I find with having big girl ta-tas, belts can be tricky and break up the body in unflattering ways.

Except that I never did get to meet Cobain. I never even saw Nirvana perform live in concert. I still regret that a little. I was 20 years old, still living with my mother, when Kurt Loder solemnly reported it on MTV News. I'd just worken up--I was working graveyard shifts at a donut shop, and so I slept in the midday. It was a hell of a thing to wake up to. I couldn't believe it at first, but he kept saying it. I burst into tears, and I was a wreck by the time my younger brother came home from school. "Kurt Cobain died!" I told him. "He killed himself!"

Nevertheless, the dogs took their time, stopping to sniff at the roadside litter that is an omnipresent fact of life in McKees Rocks. Klea found a paper bag from Wendy's that had been discarded by a passing car on Churchill Street some time before, and was preparing to gorge herself on french fries before I pulled her away. I also had to pull her away from some discarded chicken bones on Fruit Way. Ever since Buffalo Wings have become a fast food staple in this country, discarded chicken bones have become the bane of every dog owner's existence. They're everywhere, and any time a dog gobbles one up, there's a risk of bone shards getting caught in its throat.
After a long day at work, I bustled into the house at 5:45, with hungry children waiting, took off the crockpot lid, prepared to stir, and was greeted with a charred mess. Apparently, I had left it on high rather than on low. Dinner and the pot were both burned to destruction*. But at least I didn't set the house afire!

Besides, unless they're randomly sending out dozens of initial inquiries, there must be something they saw, read, heard, or learned about my services that attracted them enough to take the time to contact me.
Another reason that more women than men were targeted for witchcraft was that the Elizabethan society was male dominated. Men were all powerful and women enjoyed few rights. They were expected to be subservient to men.

Starting solids Attention preemie moms but of course I would love feedback from everyone. What is your view on solids? Did you do purees? How old was your baby when you started? Preemie moms: did you wait til your child reached the appropriate adjusted age, or actual age? I'm having a bit of an internal battle with this. Turtle-Love will be 6 months in 2 weeks. He is sitting supported and has some moments of balancing upright on his own. He salivates at the table when we eat and stares hardcore at food. We have been letting him hold breads for a couple weeks but he wasn't interested in putting them in his mouth. I've spoon feed him formula supplements a couple times to see how he does with the spoon, btw he loves it and grunts and whines if I'm not fast enough. The past three times we have handed him a bread item (a biscuit, a pizza crust, a cracker) he has put them in has mouth - I made it a game and took it from him before he could ingest anything. The last thing we gave him was a cracker 2 days ago - he slobbered on it and broke a piece off. I was terrified at first, and then watched him chew it! I made it a game again, and fished it out lol. He thought it was funny. Originally, I wanted to wait until his 6 month appointment to see what the doctor said about starting him on solids - mainly because he is a preemie and I worry about his digestive system being ready. He has given me tons of signs he is ready though. I'm just not sure. I know I'd like to make my own baby food when we get to that point.
First of all what I love about Jenny’s recipes for cleaners is that she uses ingredients you are likely to already have in your home, and if not, they are readily available at your local store. For example her furniture polish is simply olive oil and lemon juice. My house smells good just mixing it up. If I have any left I can make my homemade vinaigrette with it. Jenny has included many recipes for the modern home, granite cleaner, wet mop refill cleaner, stain remover, even a gel stain stick. Have I mentioned how much I miss my stain sticks?

I highlight Steve Rogers own words on the guy, and focus on his wisdom, conscience, and nature as a true Hero because to have read Captain Britain over his 35 year history, to have read what and who the character was when last saw him, I find it incredibly difficult to see his current incarnation as being anywhere remotely near to same individual, with the same moral compass or sense of values.

I suppose I have always thought, probably because I watched some Jesus movie one time, that Lazarus came out of the tomb slowly, stiffly, and without much animation. Maybe. He was, after all, wrapped in ‘grave clothes’ which probably prevented a great deal of motion. But maybe Lazarus came bounding out of the tomb sort of like that fella that Peter healed one day who went ‘walking and leaping and praising God’ in the temple courts. Maybe Lazarus came out with a leap and a shout something like, “He get this stuff off of me I can’t see, or talk, or run and leap and sing.”
I have been thinking more and more how I need to get back to my first novel and begin rewriting it; out of all the novel drafts I have produced over the past two years, that first one has the best storyline so far. Of course, I'll go back and fix up the second and third novels after the first one has been rewritten. Now I understand why it takes so long to get novels into presentable form: life just keeps coming around!

So while grocery shopping in Woolies, I was completely entranced by the array of pumpkins and other squashes - there were butternut, white ones and pale yellow and green Japanese ones (sorry I don't know the names). I decided to buy one pumpkin and take the plunge with it. So I did. I made pumpkin soup, pumpkin pie and pumpkin muffins with it. They were all delicious, and made me regret knowing pumpkin at such a late age. Boy have I missed out! When I returned to Singapore, with the taste of pumpkin still lingering in my mind, I told my mom to get me a local pumpkin for me to experiment with. I already knew what I wanted to make. When I saw these Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffins posted by Annie, I immediately bookmarked them - and with some expiring cream cheese, this was the perfect thing to make. Admittedly, I have to admit that our local pumpkins taste a little 'grassier' or earthier than butternut pumpkins, but since we're combining them with spices and sugar, the taste isn't all that prominent. Do use other varieties like butternut if you want a sweeter pumpkin puree.

Let me preface this by saying that I have over 10 years of childcare experience, both paid and volunteer. I was a camp counselor throughout college and, over the past 5 years, worked as a nanny for 4 different families. All of my previous positions only ended because either I or the family moved out of state. I have never had to quit a job in my life other than for the reason that I was moving. Nor have I ever been fired or let go. I have my bachelor's degree, a spotless record, First Aid/CPR certified, etc. and, if I do say so myself, I am a DAMN good nanny/childcare provider! I've maintained great relationships with all of my previous employers and have helped a lot of children reach big milestones in their lives (walking, talking, potty training, learning to tie their shoes, etc.).

At the Vatican, Borgia’s called aside by della Rovere, who tells Borgia that, if he were a different man, della Rovere would vote for him. Borgia’s been a good vice chancellor, and the skills that made him good at that would serve the papacy well, but Borgia’s also lacking in honesty and other qualities della Rovere thinks are necessary in a pope, so he plans to fight Borgia to the end. Borgia calmly says he tends to win any battles he fights, but after all, this is in God’s hands.

But today is for me. My parents are visiting my sister in Chicago this weekend, so I have the house to myself. Which is so awesome. But I want to be sure that I don’t just sit on my ass all weekend. I need to thoughtful in doing things that I get energy from. So this morning, I went to the grocery store and paid bills (doesn’t energize me, but it’s nice to have those done and checking things off the to-do list does energize me). Now I’m drinking my coffee and planning out my day. I’m meeting friend MH for coffee at 3 and lesson at 4:30; the rest of the day is up to me. I need to clean, but other than that, it’s a blank page.

“Ferne was partly the quintessential Jewish mother and partly the quintessential hippy. She took care of a lot of people, took them in, cared for them. I think no one has really accepted her death—it was such a complete and unexpected cut-off and surprise. With the death of older people you have an expectancy, or they die slow and you get used to it and you have a chance to accept that it’s happening. When young children die, it’s only the parents that get to be really involved. But with Ferne, there’s just not been the ability to accept that she died.”

In my JSTOR reading yesterday I came across a journal article by Sharon O’Brien called “Remembering Skibbereen”, based on her memoir “ The Family Silver”. Her belief is that these silenced memories of Famine deprivation, hunger, family loss, and the precariousness of housing and land, remain sub-consciously with descendants to this day, sometimes manifesting in depression or bewildering family behaviour patterns. If there is any validity to this hypothesis imagine the impact of this experience on Biddy Gollagher, Irish Famine Orphan, about whom I recently posted a story.

One observation. This year, with one long bar divided by the stairs to the stage, we split it between local beers and those from further afield. In our case local means twenty miles from the CAMRA Branch centre. No. Not my house, but still enough to give us quite a large number of beers to go at. This proved very successful (though some disagreed) with beers from local breweries standing up well to those such as Dark Star, Purple Moose, Red Willow, Stringers et al from further away. The first beer to sell out was Tandle Hill from my home town's Wilson Potter Brewery. Beers from other local breweries such as Green Mill, Greenfield, Lees and others sold very well and very quickly too.
Along the way home, we spoke to numerous members of the public and observers from the Bar Council.

I don't know if our whole workable 2 acres will become permaculture, or if that will just be some part of it, but it gives me a lot to think about as I research more and more of the possibilities. I'd love it if any of you reading this would pass on references that you've found helpful to you, as well as ideas that you have that I need to consider. I've put myself on a sort of self imposed planning holiday for this season to keep myself from making big decisions that I haven't had time to thoroughly think through. This will be my season of learning, planning and deciding.
A new section 102(a) also provides a prior right which is comparable to the prior art under EPC Article 54(3), an invention described in a patent or patent application pending at the USPTO, to constitute the state of art if the patent application is filed before the effective filing date of the claimed invention under examination as long as the application is published after 18 months from the effective filing date or upon an issuance of patent (some US patents are not subject to 18-month publication, according to 35 USC 122(b)(2)(B)). Because the effective date is defined to include a foreign priority date under the Paris Convention and the PCT filing date, the AIA expressly repeals the Hilmer doctrine (from In re Hilmer, 359 F.2d 859, C.C.P.A. 1966) and gives the patent a defeating effect as of the priority date. Thus, the AIA's prior right provision is in line with the EPC as well as the JPA in giving the patent a defeating effect as of the priority date. However, it differs from the EPC and JPA by making the prior right reference available for not only novelty but also non-obviousness. Unlike the EPC, a prior right reference does not apply to applications which name the same inventor(s) or are owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person to avoid the self-collision problem. This approach is in line with the JPA.

So, as to the solace. I am keeping up with the housekeeping, and that is making a huge difference. I didn’t spend yesterday morning cleaning up all of my mess from the week. All I had to do was a little laundry, change the sheets, run the dishwasher, and clean up the kitchen! So minimal! My mom said it’s like “found” time, and it truly is. I was able to read half of my book club book (The Help – so far, so good!) and go to book club on Thursday night without feeling like I had left a tornado in my wake.

But then there's this director that absolutely knows how to make me giggle with anticipation. Kind of like waiting in line for a ride that you love at California Adventure park, say the Grizzly Rapids ride, you're the next person to hop on, and the feeling that something big is going to happen fills you with a kid like excitement, it's an excitement that you can't really show, but it makes you shift on your feet just a little bit more.

Again it comes down to the true strength of photography being its relationship to reality, the truth and what we actually see in the world around us. So I ask again; why on earth are all these awful, unrealistic messed up images so popular?

We saw, as they passed, Mr. Ismay, Mr. Andrews and some of the ship’s officers. Mr. Andrews told us he did not give the ship much over an hour to live. We could hardly believe it, and yet if he said so, it must be true. No one was better qualified to know.
i am thankful i was able to change the mind of a 28 year old saying he did not want to get married till he was 40 into marrying me a mere 9 months later at the ripe old age of 29.

The United Nations has declared 2011, the International Year of Forests. It is a year to reflect, come together and create a plan for the future of forests. Canada began making plans for their forests years ago and their approaches have put them on the forefront of forest conservation. Since the year 2000, 130 acres of Canada’s boreal forests have received protected status.

Shortly before 18:00 GMT this evening, Mali’s transitional prime minister Cheikh Modibo Diarra addressed the nation on ORTM, his first such address since the fighting began Monday. He talked first in Bamanan, then in French; his spoken Bamanan is eloquent, which is one thing you could never say about ousted president Amadou Toumani Touré. Diarra spoke of an “attempt to destabilize” the country, and said that Mali’s security forces had achieved an “incomplete victory” against these destabilizing forces. He never mentioned foreigners or mercenaries, and he went out of his way to quell certain rumors: no, he said, the AEEM secretary general, wounded Monday, is not dead; no, the CNRDRE is not distributing guns to civilians; no, troops have not occupied the bridges; no, the Bamako airport is not closed. (That last came as a surprise to me, as I’ve heard from several sources that the airport was closed until May 7. Apparently it’s reopened.) Diarra called on people to remain calm, to get back to work, and not to listen to rumors.

Step 2. This is my precious, secret weapon - an adorable little non-stick square pan that is barely bigger than my hands. Heat it on low heat and pour your batter in after it has had time to proof for about 30 minutes. Heat until the bottom is smooth and cooked, then flip and cook until done. If you're worried about overheating then you can finish it in the oven. If you don't have one of these you can make a makeshift one for the oven out of tinfoil.
I hope the Aborigines forgive her because of her nationality. French artists are often driven by grandiose conceptions which turn out, on closer examination, to be utter bollocks. Back in my circus days, I witnessed no end of silly pranks from giddy young women who were desperate to get my attention. But I bore it all stoically because they meant well. The female whose heart is in the right place should be treated indulgently.
As has been the case for most of the debate, there was much more discussion of the youth curfew than of the loitering bill — and it must be counted as a cost of the debate that the loitering bill was an acceptable alternative by all too many curfew opponents. It isn’t — if anything, it would be worse in potentially affecting anyone, and in enacting a pseudo-legal apparatus for bypassing probable cause and ratifying police clairvoyance as a law enforcement prerogative.
Let's start with Lavender Love, a new colour released for Spring 2011. How this got onto the regular sales display already, I have no idea (neither did the sales staff), but I'm thrilled it did! It's a gorgeous periwinkle blue / purple - in my pictures it's way too blue, but it's impossible to picture correctly.
I had made a really good friend at school. We moved a lot, so I never really had friends before, but this girl was different. Sarah was so kind and warm and genuine. I was actually allowed to go to a sleepover at her house. I had never been allowed to do that before. Life in her house was so different than anything I had ever known. When they took me home her dad seemed agitated and nervous. I thought he didn't like me and couldn't wait to get rid of me. It turns out he had a bad feeling and didn't want to let me out of their car. He told Sarah that he felt like something bad was going to happen to me. Of course I didn't know that until this Spring, twenty years after the fact.
Did I mention that this was largely a long distance design project and this kitchen is in a Chicago area home? Having worked together previously on the Living Room in her home, my client was comfortable in working this way. We shared many emails, texts and phone conversations in getting this job done. And thank goodness for Pinterest, it was another helpful tool!!!! I did make one trip into the Chicago area in order to fine tune a few details, but the rest was handled by my client with advice and guidance from afar. I know Rochelle, Larry and their girls are loving their "new" kitchen and I must say, I am pleased as can be with how it all turned out!

We eat scones, a lot. Yes, we like them, but the real reason we eat them so frequently is that I forget to bake our daily bread, a lot. I make them so often, a scone post felt like giving a recipe for white rice. Even if you can't live without white rice, nobody wants to read a sonnet about it. Right. But, sometimes, serendipity steps in and turns unassuming, unremarkable little scones into a blog post.
"As an educator by profession—and one who leads trainings about racial justice—I approach these interactions as “teachable moments.” They’re also “learnable moments” for me, for each has its own nuances needing skillful navigation. Instead of taking offense to intrusive questions or avoiding difficult conversations, I try to embrace them with patience and openness. I make exceptions when someone’s downright rude, but that’s rare. Sometimes I get things right, but often, I figure out later what I wish I would’ve said.
For me, the hardest part of being so sick the past 5 weeks, was knowing that I was missing out on life and doing all of the fun things with my husband, children and friends here in Germany. Now...

After about 10 mins. in the oven, I could smell something and on checking, to my horror the butter and sugar had melted and started to drip onto the pan below!

Nevertheless, it was a lesson learnt and the cake was finished in two days.

I had a Groundhog Day moment this evening, while starring at the tupperware cupboard strewn across the kitchen floor, following my daughter around the kitchen turning off Oven knobs, closing cupboards, changing yet another nappy, loading up the layers of PJ's, dosing my sick baby up with her antibiotics and some panadol and stepping over all the toys in the lounge room, it was just seeming all very mundane, then when I thought about some of the new and cute things she did today I know it makes it all worthwhile.

But at the same time many people claim not merely to have seen them, but to have contracted beings in them and been kidnapped or ridden with them. If one reads a few descriptions of such contacts (this is what is called “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”), reads contemporary science-fiction or sees some of today’s movies, one gets a strange feeling: here are described strange beings, some of them almost human but much more “advanced,” able to do extraordinary things like turning sticks into swords, causing themselves and others to disappear, assuming different shapes at will, flying through the air, probing into the mind, or creating whole imaginary scenes before one’s eyes. Perhaps for modern man this is all “fairy tales,” but for an Orthodox Christian the phenomena which appear in these very popular literary and artistic forms are very familiar – most of them can be found in the Lives of Saints and are often a very realistic description of the way demons act.
As a two-time Emmy Award-nominated field correspondent for the National Geographic Channel, Mireya Mayor has reported to audiences worldwide on pertinent wildlife and habitat issues. Closest to her heart is her ongoing study of a newfound species of Microcebus, or mouse lemur, which she discovered on a 2000 field expedition in Madagascar. Her work with this rare primate inspired the prime minister of Madagascar to establish a national park to help protect the new species, conserving the 10 percent that remains of the African island nation’s once vast forest.

For example, Hartfiel et al. (2011) studied the effects of a six-week yoga course on a group of university staff. They found that the participants experienced increased emotional wellbeing and resilience to stress, and reduced feelings of anxiety and fatigue. The participants also reported feelings of increased clear-mindedness, composure, elation, energy and confidence.
They were wonderful and were far more fun to watch when they did the opposite of what they were meant to do.
Tacita Dean says that she "needs film as an artist needs paint." So, unexpectedly, a routine standup-and-shout turned out to be something more important, though what that was, perhaps, was according to how you saw it. A call to arms? The mustering of an army? A battle-charge? The last rites? A wake? Or a re-birth of the medium into a new life in a rather different world, where it's no longer taken for granted as the medium of transmitting stories, but defined by and used for its particular, essential, physical and aesthetic qualities?
My job was to figure out how to frame it. Sometimes when I see a pattern, I have an instant vision of how to display it and this was one of those instances. I lucked out - stitched on 32 ct. fabric, this design fits perfectly into a pre-made 8x10 frame. However, finding an 8x10 frame with two matching smaller frames that we liked *and* that worked with the design proved to be a challenge. I hunted through several stores to find something that worked - not an easy task when your constant companion is an active 13 month old boy! He's a good kid, but he only has so much patience, and there's only so much room in the picture frame aisle.

One of the unexpected benefits of this fast was that, as time passed, I noticed my cravings change. I went from dreaming of sugary snacks and desserts to wondering where on earth all the fruit had gone. I longed for berries in a way I never had. Peaches were a pure delight and melons - well don't even get me started. It seemed this fast was slowly detoxing my body and teaching it to yearn for the best the earth had to offer in it's raw, unadulterated form. As the loss of something I once held dear morphed into a gain I never saw coming, I was reminded of what a little sacrifice and a bit of faithfulness can bring.
Red indicates force, vigour and energy. Dark reds indicate a high temper and is a symbol of nervous turmoil. A lighter red indicates a nervous, impulsive, very active person, one who is probably self-centered. Scarlet indicates an overdose of ego. Pink or coral is the colour of immaturity, frequently seen in young people. In all cases of red there is a tendency to nervous troubles.

Your crazy antics,
Back in January I put myself on a three month book buying ban. And I did pretty darn good, too. But here’s the thing: I ended up borrowing a crapload of book from the library and hardly made a dent in my TBR piles at all. While I didn’t add books to my TBR piles, I didn’t really take care of them as much as I would like. And as soon as the ban was over I went back to my book buying ways and now the TBR piles are seriously out of control.

"Our cattle live a completely natural existence as foragers and grazers, the way they have lived for thousands of years. Grazing enhances a complex and balanced mosaic of native grasslands which in turn maintains vigor and distribution of these habitats, ensuring a sustainable food system. It keeps cattle on the range, fertilizes the land naturally, sustains a seasonal rhythm to the ranches and produces a remarkable meat whose flavor is the authentic taste of the American West."

On a related note, Brandi and I went to see Andrew Stanton's John Carter last night. Saw it in 3-D because it was the most convenient showing, time-wise. Overall, I was pleased with it and look forward to watching it again on Blu-ray when it comes out. The effects were extremely good (I had no problem believing that the CGI Tharks were actual, living characters), and Taylor Kitsch was better than I expected as Carter.

I love people… In the most social, non-creepy way possible. Ever since I was little, I knew no stranger. After pulling myself out of a non-social rut in middle school/freshman year (can I just blame hormones?), I began to love talking to people again. I am of the small minority that has little to no fear about speaking in front of people. That’s just part of me, part of my design.

Maybe I've just been around too long, and that the change we are seeing now is simply cyclical. If I have learned anything, it is to have as wide a view as possible about books and the publishing industry. In fact, my greater experience tells me that is true of the retail and consumer sector in general having spent so many years in that sector.
By the time it came around for the Czech Kick-Off I was excited to finally be able to tell people I was getting crowned, it's usually kept a secret and just imediate family gets clued in on the big news. I am such a blabber mouth that this task was super impossible for me but I'm proud to admit I only told a couple friends. Crowning time came and I know my grandma didn't want to come, she felt she didn't want others to see her at that point. I was bummed that I wasn't going to have her there, so we went over to the nursing home to show her my new Kroj (costume) that we had made for my crowning. We walked into her room and she was gone! We were surprised to learn she had decided to come and watch me afterall. When I arrived I saw she was sitting there right in front ready to watch me take on the honor that I would be recieving. That alone made my crowning so much more special. I recieved my crown and sash and helped to "crown" my price and princess that night. We danced the night away to polkas and spent time with family and friends. It was just an awesome experience to see all of the people that came out to support the Wilber Czechs.﻿﻿
Watch this video. Notice the story playing in her eyes. It is as if Whitney visualizes what she is singing about in the distance. She sees the emotional conflict and she allows her facial features to shift to communicate that pain to us. Note the occasional lift of a single brow and the slight incline of her chin. Muscles tense and release in her jaw and around her lips. She even does a dangerous thing and closes her eyes for several measures. But we allow her to shut herself off from us because the rest of her body’s muscular tension communicates that the entire struggle is playing out on the back of her eyelids. In fact, we get so caught up in the story, we’re willing to step inside of her head, watch the movie, and take up the struggle with her. Toward the end of the song, Whitney shows us the character’s turning point when she breaks into a smile. And we believe the words I will always love you right along with her.
My advice for young writers is exactly the same as it is for older writers. You have to become a great observer. You have to observe people and situations without getting so wrapped up in it all, and if you do get wrapped up in it all, observe every detail about yourself and your body and the way others are responding to you. And then write. If you are a great observer, you won’t write cliches or bland descriptions and your dialogue will be right on the mark. As an offshoot, it’ll bring you more joy because there’s nothing more beautiful than really noticing every little detail of this world we live in, both the miserable stuff and the good parts.

Then the anger sets in. I am not just your ordinary kind of angry, I am beyond pissed. I am pissed off that he thought he could lay a hand on me in anger. I am pissed off because he has sent me no less than 5 emails justifying putting his hands on me. I am pissed off because he is accusing me of stuff I did not do. I am pissed off because my family is broken. I am pissed off because I did so much for him and he’s an ungrateful bastard. I am pissed because his emails are taunting, almost trying to force me to respond and I hope he finds it shocking that I do not. After this many ignored emails, I hope he gets the hint that I am only going to talk about business, the business of getting divorced and nothing else. Oh wait, I did tell him a bill of his came in and it’s due date. But again, business. I am pissed that he has talked to me more via email in the past 2 weeks than he talked to me in the two weeks prior face to face. It’s stupid.

Kotex was one of the first brands to use Pinterest in an advertising campaign. Kotex found 50 “inspiring” women and looked at what they were pinning on Pinterest. Then, the brand sent the women a virtual gift. If the recipient pinned the gift, she then got a real one in the mail that was based on something she had pinned. Smoyz, the agency behind the effort, claims nearly 100% of the women posted something about their gift, not only on Pinterest, but on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. In total, there were more than 2,200 interactions based on the 50 gifts.

I’ve never owned, or even ridden, a road bike before in my life. My current bike, which I’m still crazy about, is a Trek hybrid. It’s sort of halfway between a road bike and a comfort bike. It’s got flat handlebars like a mountain bike, and its tires are only a little fatter than road tires. I tend to ride it like a road bike, and it’s pretty darn fast.
So my entire rant was a unsuccessful attempt to tell the guy i still like, that i still like him. Want to know what he did? Oh ill tell you what he did.

Yes, this is not a mistake. You read it right the first time. The Six Million Dollar Man is not available. I cannot imagine why - it can't be due to licensing and legalities, because it HAS been released on the Region 2 format. For some reason, if you live in the United States, you are SOL.

Americans are obsessed with birthing babies. Women birth the babies. In order to birth healthy babies, our reproductive organs need to be kept healthy and the way that is accomplished is through annual exams. Most women with no insurance do not voluntarily go in for annual check ups because they simply can not afford to. A pap smear at an OBGYN costs anywhere from $200-300, a mammogram is over $400.
As TA was still sleeping, Ratchlet helped us put away the food that was left. There was just one more thing to do before they could leave. Every year since Ratchlet was born, I have given her a Christmas outfit on Christmas Eve. After M-t-G came along, she got one too. Frequently they are then actually able to wear something new on Christmas Day. So before they could pack up and go, Ratchlet and M-t-G opened their Christmas outfit presents, which were a hit. Yay, something was going right!
Although I would like to think that most authors do not object to their books being sold on in aid of charitable causes, I have no evidence to support that hypothesis. But I have often found that, if I buy one book from a charity shop and like it, I will go on to purchase other books by the same author when I might otherwise have never discovered her (or him). A case in point is my current favourite author, Sherrilyn Kenyon. Two of her books, I found in charity shops. Three more I have sneakily ordered from Amazon when my husband wasn’t looking. Perhaps charity booksellers act like a kind of publicity agent, resulting in more library loans or outright purchases of a particular author’s work.

But the saying had so much sense to it that I kept it in my mind. The thought of integrity and the right thing to do has always been in my head. I stand for the way of living life actively. I believe that every day choices can and should be made. Never get used to having friends and keep them just out of habit. Well of course it gets tiring to take time out of your day to think about your friends, your lover or your family. But I think it’s what you own to social relationships. They mean a lot of work. The most satisfiyng kind of work though.

A question that comes up a lot on various homebrewing forums (or is that fora?) is what to do with the spent grains from brewing. First, for those who don't brew themselves, I should explain what I mean by "spent grains". Beer's backbone, its main ingredient, is malted barley. You can use other kinds of malted grain (like wheat), but barley is the principle grain in most beer. Malting is the process of just barely sprouting the grains, then drying and lightly kilning them to halt the sprouting process. As a kernel of grain sprouts, its chemical composition changes. Most important for us, if you take sprouted (malted) grain, grind it up, and add hot water to form a porridge at just the right temperature (typically you end up with something in the 150 deg F range) the enzymes in the malted grain will be activated and they will begin to crack down the starch in the grain and convert it to malt sugar (mostly maltose). Further on in the process this sugar, in turn, is converted by yeast into alcohol and carbon dioxide.

For his birthday, Mark got a blue ray system that allows us to access Netflix and Hulu without having to go through the Wi. I immediately went on a search for tv series that I had not yet seen, but that I had been meaning to catch up on. Enter Downton Abbey. I had heard wonderful things about this show, but I hadn't found the time to sit down and start watching it. Until Sunday. We had to pry ourselves off of the counch Sunday night in order to go to bed at a reasonable hour. Once we started watching it, we couldn't stop.

So, Blond is right that we need to rebuild civil society and has some pretty exciting ideas – but just as the state without a strong and independent civil society is an empty shell that serves the powerful, strong civil society without the state is a myth. While we ought to learn from history, the model of civil society drawn from nostalgia is not the answer, nor is a sense of the common good derived from a romantic recollection of a particular tradition.

One reason “Page One” can be regarded as a lesser film in the overall contest as films head toward Oscarland is that it does not evade the trap, which must have been apparent from the beginning, of producing a self-laudatory result full of praise for the Times. If it had taken on and absorbed some of the local news coverage issues presented by “Battle for Brooklyn” (or perhaps even “Bill Cunningham”) it might have become a truly great film. Let’s see if New York gets featured amongst the Oscar winners this year. Let’s see if “Bill Cunningham New York” wins for best documentary or perhaps the David against the 1% Goliath/Occupy Wall Street themed “Battle For Brooklyn.”
Sadly this will have reinforced the stereotype of CAMRA members as people who visit a pub once every two years, order a round of halves and then moan about the beer, and there was a bit of barracking from some of the lager-drinking regulars.
It’s not one of those “we haven’t gotten around to it” type of things (though we have plenty of those), its just that we wanted to wait until we had the dining table and chairs to install the lamp, basically to do the whole room at once. Well, I’m really happy to say that at least the lamp seems to be coming out of its box this week and hopefully, going up! While I don’t have the table or chairs just yet, I am very very close!

Comedy double act Tommy Cannon and Bobby Ball originally met in the early 1960s in Oldham, Lancashire. Apparently they began working the northern club circuit as singers (not that you'd know that from listening to this drivel), switching to comedy after being told that comics earned more money.

Lastly, I’m going to go straight Fern Gully and say it’ll essentially force us to find an alternate form of fuel. I've said it time and time again; pigeons would make the perfect fuel. Think about it, there is an infinite supply of them; therefore, the likelihood of us running low on fuel is pretty much neverthefuck. All we got to do is melt them into a liquid substance that can easily access our gas tanks. If whatever pigeons are made of have allowed them to overpopulate the world, then, by scientific fact, they can sure as hell fuel a measly car.
Echoing BITUSA, “We Take Care of Our Own,” seizes ideals that we hoist for the world to see, scratches off the gild, and exposes the stark reality of their core. I’m not suggesting that American’s have fallen short. I don’t believe Bruce is either. Rather, I believe he is directing his message to our leaders and those of us who blindly follow them.
Yeah, I think if you are going to go the route of entertaining stories, there has to be some serious formal play that's interesting to fall back on. Otherwise the work is solely hinged on the artist’s charisma.

I also question the thing that they mainly value Galaxy for their mass market appeal on their hotel room bank in Cotai, and not calling Galaxy a VIP play in line with Melco or Wynn. Excuse me, but did you guys forget about Star World and the busloads of tycoons that inhabit it? (Smell the smoke of expensive cigars!) Or the VIP-centric areas of the Galaxy Casino and the fact that their hotels are shock-full although their premium hotel rooms are not selling at steep discounts a la Venetian or non-Crown Plaza hotels in City of Dreams? Their cheap rooms, fine, but look at where it costs you to get a top suite! DB’s analysis is a bit too good to overlook something like this, so it makes me wonder, that’s for sure.

Then from out of the blue - like an arrow to the heart - comes the proposal to run a power corridor through the Rea Valley to join the wind farms which clutter the Welsh uplands with an existing heavy duty national transmission network between Shrewsbury and Wrexham. Apparently it is just that at present, a proposal. The National Grid are currently carrying out 'a consultation' between two options - there are a choice of 2 routes. The one which affects the us (aka the Purple South corridor) also involves the construction of a sub-station about 6 miles away at Abermule - and we are not talking about some wires and a few small grey boxes behind an itsy fence here - we're talking 19 acres of full-on electrical horror. It will be a similar story for the other proposed route. It looks as if it's blighted here.....or blighted there.

I haven't eaten yet. I'm about to. Then I'm going to take a shower without getting my hair wet (because Atlanta is a humidifier, though my room has an air conditioner). I thought of taking a bath, because my feet are swollen, but 1) it's not the UK where tubs are huge and wonderful, and 2) even though I would settle for an American tub, there's no stopper, no drain stuff of any sort, just a big scary hole with standing water down there. Eeyew. It wouldn't bother me to take a shower there, though. Nice shower curtain.

The AG’s interpretation of the meaning of the ‘author’s own intellectual creation’, in particular the requirement for it to be an expression of personality, is significant. The Court of Appeal specifically found (in its referring judgment) that Article 3 ‘does not on its face call for anything artistic’. Whilst ‘mere sweat of the brow’ was excluded from the ‘author’s own intellectual creation’, the Court of Appeal found it ‘far from self-evident that other, truly creative but not artistic work is excluded’. The Court of Appeal called the meaning of ‘author’s own intellectual creation’, ‘a question calling for an answer’. The AG’s opinion is one answer, although not as specific as the Court of Appeal might have hoped. This could qualify for database copyright even though the original list did not.

Little did I know this was the beginning of a long career of solo eating. I now have a job that requires frequent travel and I tend to doo it alone. The first trip I took to London I ate in the hotel. This was a disaster, the restaurant had a table of 6 builders and me. I felt terribly self conscious and the food was awful. Stuff it I thought if I’m gong to feel self-conscious I will eat good food. I’ve never looked back and will happily eat alone preferably with a book or a paper. I enjoy the peace and solitude; using the time to think and observe my surroundings.
“The two characteristics immanent in the credit system are, on the one hand, to develop the incentive of capitalist production, enrichment through exploitation of the labour of others, to the purest and most colossal form of gambling and swindling, and to reduce more and more the number of the few who exploit the social wealth; on the other hand, to constitute the form of transition to a new mode of production. It is this ambiguous nature, which endows the principal spokesmen of credit from Law to Isaac Pereire with the pleasant character mixture of swindler and prophet.”
It may be naive of me for even suggesting it, but it seems that far too many of our MPs don’t share the basic principles of the political parties they represent.

The wider area of focus here is what is termed in English as “Greater Syria.” In Arabic that part is known as ash-Sham (al-Sham), which covers what today is Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestinian territories, and Jordan (more or less). This area was original divided in four counties, “ajnad” in plural, “jund” in singular, which were Jund al-Dimashq, Jund al-Hims, Jund al-Urdun, and Jund al-Filastin, where we also find Jerusalem. Later a fifth jund was added, or created out of Jund al-Hims, namely Jund al-Qinnasrin.

The cake is also studded with a few crushed nuts for added texture and flavour and I also added just a smidgen of mixed spice. The cake is kept extra moist by the use of oil and sour cream in place of butter in the recipe. The cake is quite dense but in a good way, similar to a pound cake rather than feeling heavy and solid.

Hello Kansas
So a little about my new venture. Don't get too excited ladies, its only a summerhouse, but its my summerhouse (have always wanted one in the garden), or at least while I pay for it! It is inside the premise of Bay Tree Farm Garden Centre . There are 5 similar units there, only 2 others occupied, a wool shop and a lovely glassware shop, but hopefully the other units will soon be taken, and they are planning to add more if it takes off. The units have been their since November so its a new venture and its still very quiet, but I believe that with better advertising it may take off. I have been to the garden centre at least 3 times since November, and did not realize they had the shopping village there!!!!

That’s not why I’m writing this, though. Earlier today, I heard thunder. The storm wasn’t close enough to see the lightning or its flash. That doesn’t matter. Lightning can strike up to ten miles away from the edge of the storm. Which means, it can be sunny where you are with a storm on the horizon, and lightning can get you. If you can hear thunder or see lightning, the storm is close enough to kill or injure.

The festive atmosphere our hosts had created was impressive. There were streamers, balloons, multi-colored lights and piñatas. The tables were set up with popcorn for an appetizer and as much lemonade as we could drink. Although I wasn’t accustomed to fish that hadn’t been covered in batter and deep-fried, that fish was amazing. Many of my fellow students opted out of the main course because the fish were presented to us whole – head and eyes and all. Yum. After the meal we had a great time with piñatas and just hanging out with the kids.

When Chalice sets off for Branbury in the middle of the night with her grandfather's instructions, she has no idea of the dangers that await her. The King's men have destroyed her home village of Canton and she is suddenly thrown into a Terravailian world that she does not know. Lost and alone, she is hard pressed to evade the iron grasp of the madman who rules the land. With the help of a friendly Chinuk, an old man, and a book that she discovers along the way, not only does she find true friends and true love, but she also finds her true self and what it means to be the Raie'Chaelia.

What do you need to bring? All of the above with the exception of the barbecue! Seriously though, feel free to bring whatever satisfies your post-workout thirst and appetite. We have some creative events lined up to help stimulate reyhydration, although a common side-effect of said events is dehydration – be forewarned!
But friendship is a funny thing. Two kids can meet on a beach, on a playground or at the park and become the best of friends for that moment even if they most likely won't ever cross paths again. However, there are other times when one little girl or boy can have a tough time knowing how to make friends because they can't quite figure out how to find that one little connection that would bring two kids together.
Better bloggers than me are all over this. You can check out Isaac Laquedem, Jack Bogdanski, and Betsy over at Metroblogs, among others. Isaac in particular notes that it appears that Sam Adams is arguably in a more legally actionable position than Adams for some sort of election law violation. It's ridiculous, of course, but not as ridiculous as a beer company getting all nutted up over a guy named Sam Adams, running for mayor (and likely to win), using his name as part of a web address. Any responsible IP lawyer would have looked into things before firing off the letter, and (as it seems that KEX's attorneys have talked to them to fill them in on the context) likely would have dropped the issue once some light was shed on their apparent confusion.

As my friend Tim Glenn, reminded me once, “Of course, awakening from the nightmare means you have first been in the nightmare.” This world doesn’t even feel like a nightmare, though. It feels more like a dream that’s gone so bizarre you spontaneously grow lucid, realizing you are, in fact, the dreamer. With a bit more awareness, you realize that you can control the dream. You have influence as you create, moment by Through-the-Looking-Glass moment. I smile as I watch more and more people growing lucid in 3Dality.

In a land and a region that has known so much strife, can we honour, instead of tearing down such initiatives? Why leave things to outside peacemakers? Of course they can help and support, but I would expect Kurdish peacemakers to be the most effective in a Kurdish environment. There are now about two dozen universities in Iraq Kurdistan. How many courses are there in peace studies? How easy is it to find other Kurdish peacemakers, practicing peacemaking in all its forms; even perhaps through something as simple as a Linked in network?

The Wilson room was packed with people interested to see the film. As well as a good number of people from Barnet, John was joined by Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington , who confessed to owning and allotment in Barnet. Other notable people present were Rob Lloyd, philanthropist and secret Millionaire, Gary Peak, former Aston Villa Footballer, Joe Egan, Boxer and Eastenders star and Russell Floyd, star of the Eastenders and the Bill. All had come to express their support for the film and people affected by the cuts. During the Q&A afterwards, Russell Flioyd made an impassioned speech, echoing the sentiments of Ken Loach in the film that people have to get out on the streets. He said " I am from South London and these issues affect everyone".

You are mixing your concepts. There’s no reason to think that people emit thoughts via electromagnetic waves. So, assuming that you could even detect electromagnetic waves, which humans can’t because they don’t have the necessary sensory organs, unlike sharks for example.

Good question Charlotte, and well-phrased. There is a battle royal going on between Dawkins and the Creationists indeed, and it is important to realise that Dawkins does not = science, and Creationism does not = religion. Both are at the exclusivist ends of their own spectrum. Dawkinsism does not just applaud the theory of evolution, with which a majority of Christians probably agree, but seeks to denigrate religion as something at best infantile and at worst dangerous that should be got rid of. Creationism is not the doctrine of believing that the universe has a Creator, that many scientists have and do subscribe to, but the particular and rather peculiar idea – at least in some forms – that the world in its present configuration of species was made just so by God and what looks like evolution is not really that at all.
On a completely unrelated note, I beat Justin in our head-to-head Fantasy Football matchup this weekend.
Generally speaking, Krathong is made of banana leaves and you can decorate it with flowers, food candles and betel nuts. People in Thailand also put coins and joss sticks on it. They float krathong on a canal, a small lake or a river. Many believe that floating krathong and rafts can bring good luck. Write a love letter and put the letter on your krathong. Then float it with your girl. Just imagine, beautiful moon and evening, limpid river, sparkling candles and stars, pleasant songs and dance performances with you and your pretty Thai girl. Close your eyes and pray for your forever love and happy marriage. What a romantic moment!
You might suppose that Naaman would welcome such a simple cure for his disease. But Naaman is incensed. How dare this prophet insult him by not even coming to see him and performing an elaborate ritual to cure him! Naaman, after all, is a hero. In his mind, he deserved a heroic cure, not just a dip in the Jordan River.
I really love how it turned out!

It’s one of those strange facts about the internet, particularly when there is perceived anonymity, that people start to do things that they would almost certainly never do in real life. A sort of group-think takes over and people become vicious and nasty. They bully. A magnifying glass is held up to the darker elements of their personality and they start saying and doing things that, offline, they wouldn’t normally – or would to a lesser extent, which is where the Anonymous saying comes from.
Over the years, a few of my blogger pals have left the blogging scene, links to their blogs or recipes no longer work. One of them is MH...someone who shared with me her experience with making steamed buns. She had also taken the time and effort to type out a char siew pao recipe for me. Even though she has stopped blogging, I still keep the recipe as I know, someday, I will get to try it.

If you are due to depart at 6:30, tell him that you need to leave by 6 (or minus whatever his customary time deficit is.) I have the same situation with several of my family members. Last week, they were coming in for a 3pm event at my daughter's school. I told them it started at 2, and I still had to go by myself and save seats. They sprinted in as the music started, round about 3:05. Inexcusable, but after XX years, I know with whom I have the pleasure and I circumvent the problem.
The Jackson 5 moved on to working an opening act for such R&B artists as Gladys Knight and the Pips, James Brown, and Sam and Dave. Many of these performers were signed to the legendary Motown record label, and it has been reported that Gladys Knight may have been the one to tell Motown founder Berry Gordy about the Jackson 5. Impressed by the group, Gordy signed them to his label in 1968.
Hopefully, it will catch up to my novel Trapped, which is also in the Top 100 (for the third time) and is currently ranked at #73. Trapped was part of a two book deal with Grand Central, but they rejected it. I published it myself in June of 2010. Since then, it has earned me more than $100,000.

Recently, IV was rumored to be engaging in "catch and release" licensing with some of its patents - after getting a particular patent or portfolio, IV gives prospective licensees a timetable to pay a set amount. After the time period expires, the patent is then sold off to anyone (read: patent plaintiff firm) that feels they can monetize the patent(s), with a "back end" payment being negotiated in favor of IV. In other words, IV has allegedly started to "outsource" their patent litigation.

What helped the most, I think, are all the positive experiences I’ve had in regard to my anxiety lately. I moved house, worked all day, have gone on walks alone, driven and gone out to places with my partner all without panicking. It is such a weight off your shoulders when you’re not constantly having attacks. So, with all of that under my belt, it helped me keep my cool in an otherwise stressful situation.
Seems like I get my inspiration from either movie titles, writers or poets, Elizabeth Barrett Browning in this case……anyways, its not my wedding anniversary or the day we met or our engagement or Guru’s b’day or anything remotely to do with any major event in our life. Taking a cue from my previous post, 17 Again, I strongly believe that you don’t need a particular day to express your love and how happy you are to have them in your life. You go on through the daily events when suddenly you realize life wouldn’t be something you look forward to without this one person and how bleak and dull your life seems without that one person. Here goes…….

When a large portion of your groceries come from your garden, you really do start to feel like a contestant on Iron Chef and the secret ingredient is whatever is ripe this week. However, instead of trying to make a name for yourself as an amazingly creative chef, your real objective is to find ways to serve the same vegetable to your family three times in a week without having to duck after you place it on the table. This is how the dish Smashed Whites was created.
Saw palmetto is far safer, taken both internally and used topically on the scalp.

Well, we pretty much told all close friends and family by that night. I wanted prayer. With my history and now knowing my mutation that causes miscarriages, I was a bit mortally petrified.

“Father” is a ballad song that touches upon the belated realization of the love and gratitude for one’s father. The delicate vocals in the track help envision the feelings of a father’s heavy footsteps and the view of his back. The song will be one that anyone can relate to with its dramatic lyrics about love and the emotional vocals of the members.

My art background definitely influenced this book. At home we had books about medieval and Renaissance art, and I was fascinated with certain pictures when I was little. Hieronymus Bosch’s GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS was one of these, with its weird figures and animals in an otherworldly landscape.

You could also explain a few of your chosen titles, but leave the others explanation-free. It’s up to you.
That darn cheese man was just so charming. And we fell for it.
In recent years the popularity of wireless speakers and electronics has soared. The reason for this is that normal electrical systems are usually bulky and the wires used to power them can be messy, unsightly and unsafe as someone could easily trip on them. Speakers without wires are now easily available and the prices have dropped vastly due to supply and demand.
I’ve said it before, but I don’t find myself motivated too much by the idea of songs for the sake of songs. I want my songs to be useful. Art is a means to an end, or should have an element of that just as much as it exists for it’s own sake. I don’t mean I would write a song to try and clear greenhouse gases or something like that, but celebration, dancing, introspection, are all intentions regarding some of the effects of art. It might be that even with that target in mind, the merits of a song or piece of work might just be that it is enjoyable in and of itself, but I need some ‘higher’ goal to motivate me, and recently this has been somewhat missing. Oscar Wilde might disagree strongly on this point, but I can live with that.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs quickly sums up humans’ basic needs. From the bottom of the pyramid where needs are at their most instinctual and basic is the need for food, water and oxygen. Then, safety and shelter, and once that is found, love and belonging in community and developing self-esteem. At the pinnacle, humans strive to live fully to be all that they can be.

After fish we moved on to chicken and poularde pochée sauce suprême (poached chicken with sauce suprême) last week, and in our practical we had to truss a chicken after we'd burned off all the tiny feathers with a chef's torch - which was quite scary. We've all been taught how to correctly pass a knife to someone (yes?), but few in our class had logically transposed that rule to the blow torch, so when I turned round to accept it from a Chinese girl with singed eyebrows, the blue flame licked all the hairs off my arm.

Crowd noises, being off balance, catching a glimpse of your neighbor moving, the click of a camera, there are so many reasons why athletes false start. It's rarely about "trying to cheat"! The recent change to the false start rule is just as dumb as the recent change in the wind requirements for the decathlon. This sport is hurting its athletes and doing damage to its fan base with rules that make absolutely NO sense. The fans in Texas had it right today - just as they did in California in '87 - let the athletes compete, just make sure they all get a fair shot! Lewis was the right winner in Cali. USA Blue was the right winner today even though as I get ready to post this it says online that their protest was denied - just as Jeter was the right winner indoors. We need to worry less about throwing athletes out of the race and simply make sure everyone starts equally. Then let the athletes sort out who is best!

You can cook your matza balls in your soup – this gives them great flavor. If your soup pot is too full and you are making a very large quantity, you can also cook them in water. I recommend adding a few ladles of the chicken soup to the water or a tablespoon of chicken soup powder so that the matza balls don’t come out too watery.

When we first reached the Trocadero, I suddenly snapped into full-tourist mode. We’d been in the city for more than a day, but hadn’t seen very much that was, to me (not a former resident), really PARIS. Being the basic American tourist, as we rounded the corner of the Eastern wing of the Palais de Chaillot (i.e. the Architecture museum) and saw the Eiffel tower in full view – let’s just say, I squealed a little and took way too many photos. I made John pose, and he reluctantly complied:

You get the picture. Well, it's a new year, so what better way to start the year off than a resolution to start updating again?

(My favorites were having Mr. B with us, Mr. B holding my hand as we zoomed through the lines to the big rides, Mr. B giving kisses voluntarily on our anniversary while we were serenaded in Animal Kingdom, riding the ferries, watching the girls watch the parades, performances and rides that made them especially happy.)

Summer came and we have been watching some movies, some that have been INCREDIBLE conversations starters (and are on Netflix instant stream) are “Pay it Forward”, the beauty of that film is that the idea is by a little boy, who does not have a “perfect life”, and the acts of kindness are done and given to every person, from every walk of life imaginable. The “myth” that only good people do good things, and bad people do bad things, is reachable and teachable.
Even though everything went according to plan, even though everything seemed to fall into the right place at the right time, nature took over and left me a small reminder that, no matter what I want or think I need to do, I have little or no control over what happens in the end. Just after Christmas I ended up with a serious cold which evolved into a light lung infection. I spent most of the period around New Year with a fever, coughing up all kinds of foul stuff and feeling thoroughly miserable. At which point I realised that whatever my plans had been, there was absolutely no point in trying to run 21 kilometres unless I really wanted to harm myself.

They just stayed there in the land of the Undeveloped, and by doing so, they started to lose interest for me. The only character that actually grew or changed in any way was Raven, and, although I may take issue with how quickly he changed and what he turned into, I see what the screenwriters were going for. I just think it could've been done so much better.

The third verse has as its central theme one of Cohen’s most frequently occurring themes – lost love. The “bitter voice” reminds the protagonist of his previous love affair, with the implication that it is over long since, and that the memory of it (and possibly the end of the affair) is to prove a catalyst to the suicide attempt: That’s a hard one to remember, yes it makes you clench your fist. The description of the affair is typically Cohen; he speaks of the colour of her hair, makes an allusion to something sensual (in this case, fruit), and blurs the lines between acceptable adult romance and a more paternal feeling: there were times she was a woman, oh, there were times she was just a child, while also giving the affair an already darker edge, speaking of shadows. The word “highways” is particularly noteable here not just for the idea of taking a journey out of life by slitting the veins that “stand out like highways”, but in the wider context – “highways” are a a regular visitor to Cohen’s texts, in pieces such as The Stranger Song, or as roads (Stories of the Street). The idea of journeys, be they curtailed, about to begin or nervously avoided, is ever-prevalent.

I took it out for a trial run this morning while John was at work. After too many days off during spring break, I was nervous about how I’d feel. I didn’t have a milage goal exactly in mind, but I did really want to measure a new route I had tried out a few weeks earlier. The route turned out to be four miles out, and my legs were a tired. I kept pushing through knowing that every mile would help. Mile five felt awesome and was definitely a negative split-my watch told me! (I hate when it takes four long miles to get into the run.) At this point, I decided to take a different route home. The change-up would get me at least another mile, brining me to nine at the end (estimating milage from previous routes). Well, at eight miles, I decided, why nine when I can run an even 10?! (Runners are certifiably crazy.) Ten was difficult, but I really wanted a number to help me determine my current pace while going that far. I completed 10 miles in 1:27. I’ll take it!

However, Joshua stumbles again when he fails to consult Yahweh and is tricked into signing a peace treaty with the Gibeonites – a city of Hivites who were marked for destruction. After signing the treaty, the Gibeonites are attacked by Amorite kings and cry out to Joshua, who leads Israel’s army to complete victory with Yahweh’s assistance. After the battle at Gibeon, Joshua is seen developing new leaders with the same encouraging words Yahweh spoke to him. He completes a swift and comprehensive conquest of the land and follows Yahweh’s commands spoken to Moses.

Thus, JJS’s exposure to Jesus is, just that: a phase. Marked by a beginning and an end. In his whole collection of essays, this is the most heavy he gets, about faith issues and theodicy – which is fine. He’s a magazine writer, not a theologian, novelist, or philosopher. I’d agree with him that Jesus is a “most beautiful dude,” but I’d have to go futher than that, beyond the hip term of “dude.” Really, I am most fascinated by JJS’s claim on what Jesus accomplished: “the aestheticization of weakness.” I’ve never thought of Jesus that way. I have to agree with JJS, the “hell stuff” is hard to make peace with – quite possibly the greatest challenge of theodicy.

UPDATE: Jessops are now showing the price of the D4 at £5,289, Wex still at £4,799. The prices of the D800 (£2,399) and D800E (£2,689) remain unchanged at the time of posting. Amazon UK have the Nikon D800 at £2,399 but have not shown the Nikon D4 available for pre-order, unlike other dealers. Interestingly, Jersey-based Play.com has the D800 listed at just £2,099.99 - though it's not clear if that price includes VAT. They have a 'Pre-Order Price Promise', but it's based on the price dropping (so you pay the lower price), not on it increasing.
My initial inciting idea was born and at first I thought it was quite an amusing theme. But very quickly this became a serious story and I wanted to show how dangerous ‘smoking a bit of weed’ can become. I have taught a lot of young people on the margins of society and some of them had been sectioned because of the terrible effects of cannabis on their mental health.

On the other hand, those who want to claim that Leo XIII’s principle doesn’t apply to geocentrism struggle mightily to come up with any other example that would fit his words better. Bob takes this to a goofy extreme, proposing a whole list of Scripture passages that allegedly would fit Leo XIII’s principle:

The choices we have made over years have carved the lives we have today. Most of these choices were made unconsciously, until we wake up to the story of our lives. We all carry personal tendencies that shape the way we make our decisions. We can see these tendencies clearly in the way we reacted to our parents. Each one of us has unique interference patterns that thwart our joy. These interference patterns are like an inner saboteur that blocks our ability to live our greatest joy.
Forgive me for I have digressed. We decided that the sanded off black plywood looked a lot nicer as a countertop than the panelling so the panelling remained unused until the sandwich board application. After some yahoo (I have to believe it was a tourist) crunched the board Friday, I spent a half hour Saturday morning cutting another piece from the sheet's remainder to replace the one damaged side. The hard shiny finish acts as a whiteboard. Using hardware I already had from yardsales past, the sandwich cost no more than my time. And that is worth practically nothing these days!

Well, I can now show you the Loo Roll Mini Album that I made for the swop over at the Do-crafts forum. I've not made one of these before (this was made before the Halloween one but I didn't want to post about it until my partner had received it) and I thoroughly enjoyed doing it. It turned out to be abit more bulky than I thought as I put pressies in the wallet bits but I still like it and I think my partner does too...

These decisions that people make are ones that I can’t even begin to comprehend, often times empathy is needed but I can’t accept the fact that a person’s life is essentially being placed upon the hands of another man. A person’s life is not a game, a person’s life isn’t something that should be taken advantage of; A person’s life should not be taken just because of ulterior motives, life should be defended and honored not stolen and abused. In order to maintain life, we must maintain our aspirations beliefs and strong morals. Because without our own opinions and views we would all be mindless droids and machines, perspective holds the key to life.The way you view life essentially affects the way it will play out, even though the world is filled with hurt everything in life is impendent to change. We just have to make that change, and believe that it can happen.
A famous Arts & Crafts bloke in the 1870s was William de Morgan, a man who found a second career as a novelist. Piers too – after being fired by the Mirror for being a crap journalist – wrote autobiographical books which, on close examination, have proved to be complete fiction.
Kerri went to Brownies last night and they made Mother's Day gifts. Since a lot of moms would be picking the girls up, they had to sneak their gift under their shirt, either in the back like a camel or in the front like a wife (the leader's words, not mine). Kerri came out looking like she was in her 9th term of pregnancy carrying twins, and amidst all the giggling girls decided to start running around yelling and laughing: "I'm pregnant!" We couldn't get her car seat safety belt over her "tummy", so Nana made me turn around and Kerri "gave birth" and handed the gift to Nana, who then tucked it into her shirt and became pregnant too. Kerri then switched it back when we got home because she wanted to show her Daddy her "pregnancy".

Patti was enjoying this more positive and sensitive side to Jane, but she still hung on to a drop of suspicion. As Patti was in her closet, losing the blouse and skirt, peeling away the stockings and trading it all for soft cotton things, she caught some of Jane’s inner turbine of energy. Patti remembered when she was in her late teens and the day she could no longer keep the secret that she was pregnant. She stayed home from school, her mother noted how sick she seemed, and there was the obligatory visit to the doctor. He found nothing wrong other than fever and a little weight gain, and it wouldn’t be until Patti confessed the complete story that she and her mother reached the bottom of the relationship abyss before attempting to climb out. They never climbed out, not a step, but Patti had sworn that she and her daughter would never fall into such a place and would never need any safety ropes to hoist themselves out. So far, she and Jane had ventured down the slopes a bit, but they hadn’t gotten so far down as to lose the light of day.

It would be good to see more train related brain teasers to pass away a few minutes staring across a platform. Perhaps the next ads will be placed around Stratford and ask how long you have to wait for the next train during the London Olympics based on the probability of TfL's latest predictions having various degrees of accuracy. Or how to make a journey from x to y using as few of the Olympic hotspot stations as possible - now that would a brain teaser.
Lastly, Laughter is good to rengage the group too. A visual funny picture can go along way to depict what you want done or don’t want done depending on the picture.
For all the grimness of the concept of a heroic team that regularly loses members to terrible deaths, Jack Cole’s DEATH PATROL is astonishingly cartoony. Most of Cole’s work is a big, rich mix of the horrible and the hilarious. Next to PLASTIC MAN, the eight stories Cole made in the DEATH PATROL series rank among the craziest blends of death and comedy available in comics, or any other art form.

I hang out with Denise and her friends in a scene that’s all new to me: techno music, free parties in abandoned warehouses, late nights that carry into the next afternoon and cat-and-mouse games with the police officers who are attempting to enforce the latest, free-party-killing version of the UK Criminal Justice Act. Every weekend and sometimes during the week, Denise plays big mama to the squatters, anarchists, crusties and ex-junkies who come round to her flat in Finsbury Park.
As I mentioned in my last post, I am truly useless when it comes to resisting pretty papers....! My latest order arrived this morning and I just couldn't wait to get stuck in. I had 2 new pads and now 2 new cards have been created ;o)
When I woke up this morning, my husband informed me that I'd been moaning in my sleep. Not the happy kind of moans, either.
Think of the implications. At any point in the future, anyone can call out ‘mic check!’ anywhere, with any group of people. And they will all know what to do. And then have a decision on whether or not to join, for that moment, and lend part of themselves to a transvidual subject that speaks, in a sense, through aspects of them. This is a very powerful, new, distributed form of political subjectivity.
Just a quick heads up that we are again putting on a beer and food matching evening, with a little twist this time. Each of the beers will be from the newly established Brecon Brewing, and each of the dishes will involve cooking with beer (or cider in one example). The scary bit is I'll be cooking instead of taking part this time!
The answer might lie whether it is a matter of life or death…maybe…
Miranda Priestly: ‘This… stuff’? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select… I don’t know… that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you’re trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don’t know is that that sweater is not just blue, it’s not turquoise. It’s not lapis. It’s actually cerulean. And you’re also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent… wasn’t it who showed cerulean military jackets? I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it’s sort of comical how you think that you’ve made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you’re wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff.

Riva pursed her glossed lips, and said, “Would you two ladies care to see our tea room? In the meantime, I’ll have Ruth fill your order. Unfortunately, it will be short three ingredients, two of which you will have to get elsewhere. Right this way, ladies,” she said walking to the back of the store and extending her arm gracefully toward an ornate lavender sign with the words “Tea Room” in gold lettering. “We have a porch attached to the tea room where we grow many of our own herbs.”

Justin had to depart early, so I was flyin' solo once the Red was transfered. So as an interim "session" brew before our venture into Imperial Stout-Land, I planned out what was supposed to be a Special/Best Bitter, but what turned out to be an underhopped bitter. I had shot for an OG of 1.043 and 30-ish IBUs. Forgetting I had made some tweaks to the hop schedule to get to the desired bitterness, I went right along with what I had originally had in my head, which was about 15 IBUs short. Plus I was 3 gravity points short. So here I am on the upper boundary of an Ordinary Bitter that's lacking the bitterness. So I'm thinking I'm going to turn out with a balanced XLTPA-ish type beer with a different hop and yeast profile. We shall soon see.
Columbus has one of the best zoos in the country- Lots of animals- Lots of good exhibits..... and yet, our children kept begging to play on the playground. Pretty much a glorified McD's playground. I think we spent at least half our day just letting the kids play on the equipment.

He glanced at Taslin in apology and regretted it. Beneath the graceful arch of her eyebrow, her eyes were bland, almost as he'd expect from a Wilder, except that a spark of humour danced there, and her smile was all too knowing. She gave him a sharp nod of permission - permission! Rel clenched his jaw to keep back an outburst. The Axtli was still out there, its form indistinct without Clearsight but still felt, a sense of First Realmspace itself under strain.
Humans often remark upon my extraordinary vocabulary. “What’s your secret?” they ask. The answer is that I used to play Scrabble in my circus days. Initially with the clowns, who taught me only dirty words, but later with my mentor Dr Whipsnade, who exposed me to a broader lexicon. I do not play much in the jungles of the Congo, where word games are viewed as a sissy pastime, but in a few days time I shall be visiting London for the holiday season. It is there that I am scheduled to play a friendly game with the world champion.

2) We know people would have been offended if he hadn't changed the words; why aren't they offended anyway? I'm sorry, but I can't imagine that the same folks who would be apt to write angry letters over the "no religion" line would be particularly cool about me saying, "Hey, the United States shouldn't even exist." And yet, that's exactly what the first part of that verse says, isn't it?

Even today, with a collection of years dulling the hurts between us, I’m still not sure she knows what she did for me that summer. Although neither of us was willing to acknowledge it just yet, wickedness had grown like thistles against the backbone of our friendship. Setting me up on that date was her last act of childhood innocence, and later; the mark of kindness to fill me with the grace to forgive her.

But most importantly, I got to meet some new friends and see a few old friends from my Columbia MFA days. We sat down over drinks and food and talked about writing and reading and life and teaching. I realized how much I've missed the intensity of being surrounded by writers, of accessing a shared vocabulary to talk about craft and narrative and sentences and books. I realized I've been going along feeding the fire with tiny bits of kindling and scraps of wood and then this weekend came along and brought with it a barrel of kerosene and two cords of wood.

This experience had a profound impact on my life. I felt that finally, after years of searching, I had found the truth. I changed my diet and became a vegetarian. I went to the local ashram and listened to what is called Sat-Sang, which is supposed to be divine discourse on the knowledge that Maharaj Ji was giving to all who asked. It wasn’t long before I decided to give up worldly things and devote my life to the guru. I moved into the Philadelphia Ashram and became a full-time devotee of the guru.

Of course she swore up and down that she'd paid her tickets and that her license was good, but then again, almost everyone operating after suspension says that. And I know that she won't get her license fixed any time soon but I'm actually good with that, because now that I know her car and where she lives and works, I doubt that it'll be too hard to find her driving around again. You see, I'm betting that when I do find her driving and I lock her up for operating after suspension, I'll get another crack at her car and odds are pretty good that I'll probably get more weed or maybe something even better. So she'll go into my "perp bank" folder and I'll keep an eye out for her car on those slower nights when I need a lock-up but can't find anything else. It's always good to keep a few of those in reserve.
One of the moms had her baby last weekend, she, who was the last of our little pregnancy group to give birth, shows up with her new daughter. Yay for alive babies~right? NOPE. I gave her a hug and asked how she was feeling and said how her daughter looked like her husband. I'll give you one WILD guess if she asked about me. I didn't talk to her the rest of the morning. I was exhausted after the party. Kai said he had a great time...Sometimes I want to look at him and say "you know I'm taking one for the team little" but I don't, I just say "I'm so glad you had a good day buddy"

For this page I was experimenting with inking two different patterns with the varitone ink, just to see what would happen. What I did is I inked the xoxo and heated it first and then went back with the dots and heated them. Its a mixed result--I'd hoped that you'd be better able to see the xoxo underneath, but I think I needed to let it set inbetween applications, because the second layer bled a bit. Here is a close-up:

So if they cut out all the dialogue-free scenes and flashbacks, I bet the last episode would have been 30 minutes long. And this stuff is getting repetitive. How many times with Park Ha not answer her phone and Yi Gak spend all day looking for her? And the evil couple, I hope that those two just stay together because I’m sick of their numerous repetitive scenes. Having said that, right now, I’m more intrigued about how they solve this mystery of theirs. The driving plot is moving quite slowly so I hope getting the romance in full swing means we’ll finally get the mystery going.

Two pounds is not a whole hell of a lot of flour folks. Just in case you were wondering.
Once again, I blocked out all the protests and cries and accusations of being dropped on my head as a baby and focussed all of my attention on seeking out the closest assault suit’s cockpit and lining its pilot into my sights. I did everything in my power to keep my cool, in spite of the chaos and bloodshed around me, and held my breath for as long as I needed to get the shot just right, because that’s all I had before those walkers were on top of us. One shot that could have spelled our salvation or sealed our destruction. I had to get it perfect.

But . . . well, I don’t know about the kids, but I kind of had fun. We had a nice spread of food, ate well, everyone talked to everyone, the music was great . . . I made a poster on which everyone could write something they were hoping or praying for about 2012, and I’m going to post it in my office with the intent of praying about those things. Let’s hope I actually do it; my prayer intentions are always better than the actual follow-through. If I were going to make a New Year’s Resolution (which I’m not), it would be to make my prayers more intentional and consistent. We’ll see. Last year I made a non-resolution to be dating someone with a view to marriage by now; summer came and I had forgotten all about it, until in September or October or something my dad reminded me of this, with a wink toward Paul.
I think the darkness of the film makes it unique. Any time a serial killing or murder is part of film, most films will gently sweep over that aspect, but I think this one doesn’t shy away from the horrible things that happened there. It raises the stakes of the film, which in the end, I believe, makes the film more rewarding.

We have a bed problem at work. The problem is that we don't have enough beds. Specifically critical care, and medicine beds. this results in having medicine patients on surgical floors. And that means sub-standard care for EVERYONE. Why? because all we do, day in and day out, most of the time, is SURGICAL care. We just dont SEE all that much of the pure medicine stuff.

On the one hand, it's always refreshing to see an adaptation that doesn't bastardize the original source. But on the other hand, for those of you who have already seen the movie, there is nothing new or undiscovered waiting for you between these covers. It is the equivalent of reading a novel-length plot synopsis of the movie. An exercise in futility, almost, which is ironic and a shame, since Bloch's work predated the film.
Another thing I am learning about being in production and being a parent is that I've had to be the controlling helicopter type parent our culture likes to make fun of. I write notes. I label stuff. I get hyper about tv watching and bath schedules. I used to take on the mantra of "as long as they're happy!" in regard to my kids and their caretakers. But that was making me crazy. For lack of better language, it really sucks to sit in rehearsal for hours and come back to a house that has gone berzerk. Spending two hours digging out from toys and dishes when I could be with my kids or rewriting is not ideal. I've become a bit more demanding in terms of what goes on in here when I am working.
I travelled to Toronto not really knowing what the girls had planned but it did not matter to me. I love the art and the culture this city has to offer and I knew it was going to be incredible just walking the streets and taking it all in. The girls decided they were going to take me for breakfast and then to the AGO, at this time I was jumping for joy with excitement. They went on to say there was a special Picasso exhibit and they wanted me to see it. I must admit I have never been a huge fan of Picasso but was excited to see his work. I had only seen his work in books and I have always thought that if you limit yourself to just books you will never really know if you love the work or not. You have to expose yourself to the real thing

After a little badgering, Daisy gave in. At around the same time, he was talking on twitter about getting his hands on some game birds. I demanded Magpie Pie. Not because I have any particular desire to eat magpie, or even know whether it's a bird that is considered to be good eating. But for no other reason than that the name tickled my silly bone. Magpie Pie! Magpie Pie! Magpie Pie!
There are several reasons for the rejection of a manuscript. There is no need for us (writers ) to feel insulted or hurt. A rejection does not mean that a writer is bad, it just means that the story has not resonated with the editor or that they have different visions for it. It’s nothing personal. Do you feel there are any other reasons for rejecting a manuscript? What does rejection mean to you?Please share with us.

The EU, meanwhile, is working 24/7 to try and establish in the X-factored mind that there is no correlation between the eurozone and its currency. This is pure 1984 stuff, and increasingly hilarious to watch. Infamous Leatherwoman Fifi Lafrumpe at the IMF said last Saturday that just because there was a problem in the eurozone did not mean that the currency itself was anything less than rock-solid. Further north in Berlin, Frau Doktor Rochester is still locked in the attic, but before being confined to quarters, she did say that if the euro fails, the EU fails.

You’d think there would not be nearly enough authors to go around. But there are many authors who never get invited to festivals. These authors are not your obvious entertainers, not young or beautiful, dashing or handsome, not a celebrity or war hero, politician or pop star, not last year’s best-seller or this year’s major prize winner. They are normal people who write books, and they are usually busy sitting at home and authoring their next book, while their more famous colleagues are busy talking about their last one.

Charm is a quality with a decreasing amount of value the closer Saturn gets to Scorpio if it is not also attached to absolute integrity and authenticity. Those are the qualities that make bank under Saturn in Scorpio. People who have skated by on looks, charm, charisma, or social prowess and facade are going to find these qualities don't get them nearly as far as they used to.
Well, onto trunk or treat. We have a trunk or treat at church where the kids trick or treat from car trunk to car trunk in the church parking lot. This year however it decided to snow on the designated night so we went into the church and used the classrooms as trick or treating places. It was fun and much warmer so we liked that. Owen had a blast and was beside himself with all the treats he was receiving. Although, when he would get to a classroom door he would almost inaudibly whisper, "Trick or Treat" and then while we were walking to the next door he would shout it at the top of his lungs. He is such a silly boy, pretending to be a little shy, maybe that is part of his strategy to make him look cuter so they will give him more. Ryan and I don't mind, seeing as most of that candy doesn't actually make it to Owen. Don't judge, he is only two and a half, we are being good parents:)
Here are two of the pieces I wrote while on a Minnesota State Arts Board Artist Initiative Grant trip to Ireland last summer.

I arrive to find him sitting outside texting. We hug and decide to go to a different place. He continues to text during the walk. I was feeling particularly saucy, so I asked, “Am I interrupting something?” He stops and we continue to our new destination. While ordering our coffees, his phone rings, and he proceeds to have a conversation the entire time we’re waiting. I’m not impressed. Ask my friends. There’s nothing that infuriates me more than being out with someone who spends the entire time texting or talking to someone else! It’s rude.
My half marathon is going to be here before I know it, and I've been a bad trainee. I did something to my shoulder last weekend and it's ached all week, but starting to feel better.

You can pick up books from the library, swap books with friends or a local book swap group, or even purchase books you want to have to refer to in the future. I’ll use the example of sewing, one of my file topics. I have some books on sewing that I refer to often, and are a great help. I would love to add to my collection of reference books on this subject, because they are a huge help when I get stuck in a project and am not sure what to do next! Plus, I’m a huge fan of having books, anyway. ;)

While the sets certainly have the sixties vibe, many of these interiors work today. If you want to create your own retro interiors, look for the usual suspects -- designs by Eero Saarinen, Knoll and Herman Miller along with Tulip and Eames chairs -- real or knock off. And of course a place to mix the requisite cocktail.
I thought about my dad right then. I thought about his crippling anxiety. I thought about how maybe he has Asperger’s. I thought about how he doesn’t really do small talk with strangers in stores or laugh at himself. I thought about how he yells so much that he doesn’t even realize he’s doing it anymore. And he never would’ve bought $22 worth of goat’s milk lotion for no reason from a desperate lady in a sad little boutique.
I’ll write some more for the Skeptictionary about faith itself soon, because that’s what a large part of this argument comes down to. But the claim that we must accept Jesus, either under all circumstances or just some subset, seems irreconcilable with any notion of fairness or consistency that I can come up with. As always, feel free to tell me what I’ve failed to consider.
Questions. People ask them every day. Some are so insignificant that they can easily be ignored while others cannot. They need to be discussed and the questions answered. I have a question that needs answering, something that has been lingering in the back of my mind for a long time. I was hoping that somebody could please enlighten me on the matter as it is having a great impact on the human race.
I also love it when a plot twist takes me completely by surprise. But this moment is absolutely my favorite.

So, we decided that we would get up early and catch a bus to the East most point of the South Rim to see the sunrise, and so we did. Surprisingly it wasn’t really that cold, there was a chill in the breeze, but I guess looking at the spectacular Canyon in front of us, we (almost) forgot about the cold. It had snowed just a few days back, so I was expecting it to be freezing, moreover I had cold and was afraid it might get worse.

The shop has been empty for some time, but in December 2008 it re-opened its doors to once again offer the 'yoof' of Southend some alternative clothing (all be it in a more 'emo-friendly' kinda way). The name above the door is now 'Threads Atomic Dustbin', and I bet the new owners musta worked on that one for days! Mind you, I'm reckoning that the only people who will get the 'joke' will be in their 40's (Neds never really were a household name were they??!), the same people who will have little interest in shopping there!! (I mean, do they even make those massive black flared jeans in 40+ waist size??!).
As a result of watching the Just One Book campaign, I am renewed in my belief that just because a company publishes wonderful books, it does not follow that they are a successful publisher. Production and editorial values alone do not make for publishing success. Publishing, as practised by commercial publishing ventures, is about creating lists that successfully reach a paying market (which may or may not be the end consumer) and are therefore profitable. The required scale of that profit is for the publisher to determine according to their own objectives and shareholder or stakeholder pressures. But whilst there are many measures of creative and artistic success in the form of literary gongs and industry awards, Mr Micawber’s advice about what represents financial success still holds true today.

Notice that the Holy Spirit and The Word bear witness in Heaven and are in unity with the Father. But on earth, there are two witnesses—the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ. They both have come in contact with sinful humanity on earth. The word picture given here in 1 John 5:5-8 is the same as given in Exodus 12:22:

These blog photos were taken in the Canadian national parks where these animals are protected wildlife. Our photos were taken in the national parks of Banff and Jasper. Hunting is illegal and for a good reason. As more tourists pile into the parks, roads and trails built for human travel, the wildlife are increasingly pushed further away from their natural feeding and grazing areas. Several million visitors visit these parks annually year round. These parks are rock-stars that give Canada the world-wide fame for its many million hectares of remote, awe-inspiring mountain wilderness and wildlife.

With the fabrics washed, dried, and pressed, I was able to cut out the bodice and mark all the markings. I used the old fashioned tracing wheel and tracing paper. I like this method, because the markings are faint and don’t show through to the front side of fabric like fabric markers do. And it is extremely accurate. Using a ruler to guide your tracing wheel also helps to make accurate dart lines–all 6 of them for this dress. Because I traced the pattern onto Swedish tracing paper, the tracing wheel does less damage to the pattern piece, in case I want or need to use it again.
Dunollie Castle is built on an ancient lava block next to the coast. There are no easy approaches to get to it. The block is about 4 to 5 stories high. Add a stone wall around the edges and then within that a four story castle. The brick work is lovely, all black stone, fiting together a mosaic of stone. The cellar is on the ground floor. There is then a steep, uneven staircase to the next floor which is open to the sky. Once this would have been the great hall. The two stories above were the Laird’s chamber, the private rooms and above that, the defensive roof and walkways. All with a beautiful view of the surrounding area. The building is covered with ivy, which is slowly destroying the castle. The ivy places rootlets into the walls and makes holes and sucks moister away. To kill ivy, you need to kill it from the top and bottom at the same time a year before the restoration work is to be done and you must do restoration work otherwise the dead ivy causes damage.

Even in tough budget times, there are lines that cannot be crossed. So I was startled by this tidbit reported recently by The Associated Press: When Sarah Palin was mayor of Wasilla, Alaska, the small town began billing sexual-assault victims for the cost of rape kits and forensic exams.
Food is an easy example of the power of lack. When we control the food that our children eat we give greater value to the foods we withhold. If we say, "You can only have one cookie," we have just given the cookie greater value than the green beans we pile on their plate. In our house we have lifted all controls on food. If you have had strict controls on food you can expect that your children will react to that as soon as the strict controls are lifted. We have found that our children still approach food from a place of lack as soon as they suspect that there might be a limited quantity of any particular food item. For example, our girls love microwaveable Asian soup bowls from Trader Joe's. When we first started buying them there was a great deal of concern about who had eaten how many and how many were still in the pantry. When I assured the girls that there were plenty and we could always go to the store to buy more they did not instantly trust that this was true. They were still responding from a place of lack. When I started buying huge numbers of soup bowls at a time this helped some. However, what has helped the most is months and months of making sure that we always buy soup bowls so that they girls can build up the trust required to let go of their feels of lack.

According to the report he had been found lying face down in his drive way dead. It had been another Coroner who had evaluated him on scene and had put down apparent drug OD as the possible cause. Neighbor statements substantiated that he was known to do drugs and that he had no next to kin. An autopsy had been pending.
Nevertheless of these facts, there are some parts to be complemented. From my viewpoint, I think PR Couture’s Tumblr has limited function to attract users or interact with them. Since, Tumblr is mostly used as microblogging with pictures, it can be replaced to Pinterest; some long articles may be irritates readers who expect short text and visual contents. Also contents in Tumblr contain that can be read on its Website or Facebook page. It seems the contents are duplicated too many times. The other one is Google+ . Google+ acquires only 49+, and only 38 circles are there. It demonstrates that ‘PR Couture’ is using less proper social media that not many users are listening. It seems that those platforms are not necessary and useful; it could waste of its resources.

I am a self-avowed enthusiast of things fanciful or science fiction-esque and, as a general rule, I do not begrudge other groups their obsessions with whatever ghost, goblin, or android currently catches their fancy. Do I like Twilight? No. Do I begrudge the fans their interest in Twilight–no, not really. Indeed, my problem with zombies is very specific. I don’t mind that zombie films are popular or even that some clever little student group is distributing bogus health information to no-doubt confused international students. My problem is that the modern zombie, in its current incarnation, makes no internally consistent sense and, therefore, fails to enable me to suspend my disbelief.
You need to start where the story begins. I like a beginning with lots of action, but it has to make sense for the story. In other words, don’t implant a car chase on page one unless that’s part of your story. In other words, it has to make sense.

I joke that my husband would get rid of me and the girls before he would get rid of Buddy, but I think there is some truth to that.

Stepney reveals in detail the exact workings of the floor that was used at the race: ‘The front floor is attached to the chassis via a mechanical hinge system at its most rearward point. The most forward support is a body with one compression spring and one tension spring inside which can be adjusted according to the amount of mass that is fitted to the front floor. There is also a skirt that seals the floor to the chassis, which is made out of rubber and Kevlar to help flexibility and reduce friction in the system.

'New Ceremony' starts with the delicate plucks of the brittle strings in true folk fashion and with a trusty environmental reference chucked in there. In this case it's the 'shipping forecast.' A similarity to the Mumford massive's prior mention to the 'harvest' and their generally wholesome vocab. Somewhere turbulence overrides and a more rock side suffices into something that bares an uncanny resemblance to a solo Brandon Flowers' one hit wonder 'Crossfire.' It slots in to place rather well, showing that they just like to copy other bands. Just kidding, that is arguably one of the better songs on the record and they have managed to make it sound like a DTR song. An eerie presence is felt in 'Bible Belt' and 'Demons' with the soft reoccurrence of Peter Liddle's distinct vocal range speaking 'day in and day out', breezing through the rippled concoction of the epic atmosphere created within.
Después de que Miller se uniera a la Fuerza Aérea a finales de 1942, Bobby trabajó como músico de plantilla de la NBC (1942-1943) y participó en la organización de los Town Hall Concerts de Eddie Condon, pudiéndosele escuchar en los volúmenes 1-5, 7 y 8 de los 10 grabados. Tras un año en la NBC, reemplaza a Red Nichols en la Casa Loma Orquesta de Glen Gray, donde permaneció hasta 1946. En Mayo de 1947 toca con Louis Armstrong en el NYC Town Hall Concert, además de actuar como director musical. Entre 1949 y 1951 toca frecuentemente con Red Allen y Wiley Lee. En la primera mitad de los 50 realiza una serie de grabaciones producidas por Jackie Gleason ('Music for Lovers Only'), con un total de seis álbumes. Son el más claro exponente del Easy Listening y en los créditos de los discos, el único músico al que Gleason le reconoce su labor es a Bobby Hackett. En 1952, participa con su banda en una de las emisiones musicales de la WMGM ('Dr. Jazz') que posteriormente lanzaría como disco el sello Storyville. En esa época actúan dos noches por semana en el Lou Terrasi's, mientras el resto de noches son el respaldo de Billy Butterfield o Pee Wee Erwin. Con Eddie Condon y Lee Wiley, abren el primer Festival de Jazz de Newport, en julio de 1954.
Vince and I really hit it off with the wine talk, and he has a true passion for wine. Unfortunately, I really haven't even looked at his wine list yet, but I do know that the Kenwood Cabernet he pours by the glass is not the regular bottling you see at most restaurants. For the price, it's a nice wine, and better than most any "house wine" I've had in a restaurant, though Vince doesn't believe in pouring house wines. I can't blame him really.

Many countries have different degrees of regulated legal service providers, one of which may be called a “legal consultant.” These “legal consultants” are legitimate, but have limited authority to provide only certain types of legal advice. They even exist in the U.S., for example, in New York and California. These are lawyers licensed in other countries who are authorized by New York or California to provide legal advice only in connection with the lawyer’s home country. These consultants generally are restricted from providing legal advice regarding U.S. laws, including immigration laws.

God rejoices in our returning to Him. When we stray, God is grieved. He loves us and desires to have our fellowship. I am not talking about going to church on Sunday fellowship, but rather His desire to have us talk to Him and listen to Him and join Him in the work of making salvation and forgiveness available to anyone who will believe on a daily basis. Sadly though, the church rebels against God as much as Israel did in the Old Testament. But just like His passion to see Israel return to Him, God desires us to return and when we do, He blesses us with awesome love and forgiveness. Then He puts us back to sharing that love with others. That is why He pours out His Spirit on us and allows us to see glimpses of glory through dreams and visions.
For those who don’t know, the LDS Church has a genealogical system, called FamilySearch, that is an attempt to have one centralized genealogical tree for the entire world, we people can coordinate and share information about their forebears. Part of this system is also used to track the work we do in our Temples in behalf of the dead (baptism, sealing families together, etc). When I was last in the Temple (Saturday, thanks to the encouragement of my lovely wife), I had some ideas on what the Church FamilySearch and Temple programs could do to improve the process of taking names of family members to the Temple to do their work. I’ve no idea how I could get the idea to the people who would need to hear it, but I thought I’d put it down here at least.

Story blurb: Eros and Thanatos converge in the story of a glorious youth, an untimely death, and an imperial love affair that gives rise to the last pagan god of antiquity. In this coming-of-age novel set in the second century AD, Antinous of Bithynia, a Greek youth from Asia Minor, recounts his seven-year affair with Hadrian, fourteenth emperor of Rome. In a partnership more intimate than Hadrian’s sanctioned political marriage to Sabina, Antinous captivates the most powerful ruler on earth both in life and after death.

Plan to eat the perishable fruits and veggies first. I don't keep a lot in my pantry (don't have the space in my house) so I buy what I need when I need it. I try and utilize pantry and freezer items so I don't have stuff languishing. The recipes for the meals are below. My friend, who has a family of four, also meal plans. She has to make a lot more meals and her leftovers (if any) are lunches for her or her husband the next day. This is what works for me, there are other ways, and I don't always make a new recipes. Summer time is not infrequently just something on the grill with a salad and veggies.

Conspiracies and conspirators do exist, but not at all like the nut’s visions. Like the blind pig that occasionally finds an acorn, truthers do rarely stumble across something real. But in their zeal to uncover a clue under every leaf on the forest floor, they only obscure the very thing they hoped to reveal. Sniffing false trails galore, and drawing ridicule on legitimate inquiries, the truther is unwittingly the conspirator’s most diligent accomplice.

The next day started out well enough. The other employees of AlItalia honored our quasi-legitimate rebooking, and we made it from Vienna to Rome, then on to Palermo. Then: 'Oops, sorry, one of your bags was put on a later flight to Palermo. Or maybe it was Milan.'
The morning was spent eating breakfast, filtering water from the creek to refill our water bottles, and packing up camp. There is a water source that's close to the campsite entrance, but it's a shallow muddy little spring, so we opted to hike down a steep bank to Porter's Creek. It was absolutely gorgeous in the snow!

We had the opportunity to attend a dinner during the Muslim holy week with Muslim leaders. What an educational opportunity. The first few weeks and months went by in a blur as we tried to take in the world of differences outside of our door.
“You got a God-given talent.” She tried to set the tea cup down on the side table. I reached over and took it, setting it down for her. She beamed at me. “Thank you, honey.”
Mr. Cunningham is an example of a curious cultural phenomenon. His fervor and unbreakable dedication to his work is not simply trapped in the world of fashion. In every walk of life there are maniacs of a similar sort, people who have crafted something seemingly minor into an art form. Look at plumbing. I guarantee there are people who care so deeply about controlling the path of water in an industrial environment that they have made it their life work. Every aspect of our society has an obsessive, unrelenting and unyielding, whittling their field down from the basic to the infinitely artful. For Cunningham, it’s what people wear. For Isaac Newton, it was calculus. For Bill Gates, its computing. They are the web of passion, coursing through every fiber of civilization, holding the whole thing together for the rest of us. The blood pumping away under the surface.
"Free trade" is effectively an ideology in recent times. Economists understand the advantages of free trade -- how it increases most everyone's absolute wealth (buying power in goods). It's understood the disruption and economic damage the raising of trade barriers would cause. All true.
The student leader will also speak of two books: one written by herself and a compilation of thoughts by Salvador Allende, Gladys Marin and Pablo Neruda, among others.

In January 1861, William Washington Knight was elected Justice of the Peace in the 1144th Georgia Militia District. As an elected official he could have claimed exemption from military service during the Civil War. But on October 1, 1861 Knight enlisted in the “Berrien Minutemen,” a Confederate army unit then being organized by his father, Levi J. Knight. William served in the 29th GA infantry in Company K, the Berrien Minutemen, and was elected 2nd Sergeant.
Attacking and excluding "racists" for "attacking or excluding Jews because they are Jews" is in fact the quintessential jewish conceit. It is the epitome of jewish privilege and supremacy that jews as a group feel free to attack or exclude whomever they wish, which just makes them good jews, and at the same time painting Whites who attack or exclude jews, or by "liberal" extension any other "minority", as the most stupid/crazy/evil people ever.

How could the internet kill creativity? Isn’t it a place where people could express themselves freely to the world and share ideas? The answer is yes. But sometimes, this isn’t always a good thing. Some people like to find what works, and stick to it. They get so stuck on a formula of what works, that they don;t even use their creativity anymore.

Transition 2 was much easier than my first. Although I STILL had to stop and go pee. I don't know how these other athletes do it! I guess if I could finish the whole course in 2 hours, I wouldn't have to stop and pee either . . . but my bladder just couldn't handle it! This time, my left hand was no longer a claw and all I had to do was rack my bike, take off my helmet and gloves and hit the ground running . . .
While I'm sure they're thankful that no one was hurt, I feel terrible for whoever lost their place and everything in it. If anyone knows the residents and can suggest any way to help, please post it here or on Brooklynian.

This weeks episode started with a funeral for the old bloke who’s name escapes me, and therefore illustrates that many of the cast do not get much enough time for us to know more about them, or empathise more with them. I’ll admit that in the previous episode he was featured more, if not from a point of view many of us could not agree with. He was representing the humanity of the world we live in now, not the world he now lived in. He got an unfortunate argument for why he was wrong when a zombie pulled his guts out. How do zombies know that pulling guts out is a good food source? I don’t know, maybe experience. Perhaps T-bone will get more screen time now. Oh yeah, this week he did. Also, why is Glen not trying to nob that brunette? Most people like Glen, we want it to work out for him. They’ve barely spoken in the last few episodes.

I need dresses! I never had many, they are too expensive and I always thought – you can’t wear a dress as often as you can separate bottom and top pieces which you combine to create different looks, so I never wanted to spend so much money on dresses. But I do love them! And now, that I can make them exactly how I want them, I want to have several!

One more thing, unrelated, did you see the watermark on my first card down on the left corner? I have been wanting to do this forever! I think it is important that one gets credit for their creations. Without it, it is possible for anyone to claim they made something that was actually a creation of someone else. I am not sure how often this happens, but I am sure it does. I have tried to figure out how before with different editing software, with no luck. I am not that computer savvy when it comes to things like this. A couple of days ago, I saw on Pinterest a how-to from a site called Picmonkey. Oh my goodness, it is so EASY! And it works! And it doesn't cost anything. If you are interested in a tutorial, let me know. Or go to my Pinterest boards (link on right side of my blog) and go to my Papercrafting Board and you can check out her tutorial. Too cool!

I really need to remember that it is okay to be a Mary and rest at His feet. This year God has been reminding me to just rest in Him. Take a siesta (figuratively), be quiet and still so that I can just soak in what He has for me. Some days are easier than others to remember to take a few moments to just be. Making my brain stop is hard though. Even when I am too tired to think, it seems I am still over thinking, and remembering to rest in the Lord and rejuvenate is difficult to do. I know I need to the lesson of the turtle, take it easy and just rest a while.

Whitman dragged his gear outside, tied on a headband to keep the sweat out of his eyes, and began shooting over the parapet. Down below on the southern side of the building, student Thomas Eckman heard shots and threw himself in front of the pregnant Claire Wilson. A bullet went through him and into Wilson’s belly. Eckman died at the hospital and Wilson’s baby was later stillborn with a crushed skull. Professor Robert Boyer was also killed in the southern plaza in front of the Tower.

James Blakely’s “The Steal Deal” reads like an homage to Mickey Spillane Mike Hammer novels replete with witty repartee and smug confidence displayed by Blakely’s larger than life PI – Sonny Busco. With female character names like Pixy, Bambi, and Bevel Brand, it is no surprise Busco throws out lines like there is no tomorrow. The novel’s overall voice and narrative is perfectly executed. Just take a read of this passage:
PC- "Yes, but what does that have to do with me not taking the paper?"
This, then, is the function of historical fiction: ‘historical,’ because it is a reasonably accurate reconstruction from existing records; and ‘fiction,’ because it is a composite of the lives and attitudes of the times--both the good and the bad. It also serves to mark a lifestyle that might otherwise be forgotten.

I'm such an impatient reader, and really, not much happens at all for a good long while. Normally I'd be complaining right now about how I had to wait almost 200 pages before the action even kicks in and the hunt itself doesn't even start until after page 220. In a book that's only 293 pages long, normally I'd be pissed, or at least totally bored.

Mix together the wet ingredients. Stir in sifted dry ingredients. Mix well. Glop on heaping spoonfuls on your cookie sheet. I do about 3-4 spoonfuls per cookie, so I get 9 cookies per cookie sheet. (They don't need to be this huge, but I like them to be this huge! Almost like cookie/cupcakes) Bake at 375*F for 12-13 minutes or until cookies are cooked through. (You can tell by looking to see if the tops still look mushy and uncooked).
Most of the sci-fi shows you enjoy today owe some kind of debt to Farscape. On the flip side, most of the sci-fi shows you grew up on, Farscape liberally stole bits and pieces from. It’s quite possibly the most unoriginally original series ever made. Here’s a show that came along at a time when space opera wasn’t doing a whole lot of experimentation, and yet that’s almost exclusively what Farscape did. It took heaping platefuls of well-worn sci-fi clichés and ideas and turned them on their ear, seemingly just to find out what would happen. Most of it worked, some of it did not, but that’s the price you pay for innovation. The show was primarily a drama, but that didn’t stop it from working in jokes and sight gags whenever possible. This was considerably different when compared to the various, dry Star Trek series that were around at the time. It also featured loads of monsters and aliens, most of which stand the test of time, which is unsurprising since The Jim Henson Company was behind the show, and they are, after all, the folks who built an empire on a frog and a pig.

Next, you have a simple bra- no underwire- soft cup. Very comfortable but still leaves you flopping around when you need the best support possible. I would compare this to those that who really urge breastfeeding, but then come back and say things like "start solids early", "you are nursing too often", "if it doesn't work out then just switch to formula", or "formula fed babies sleep better at night." A lot of times they bring up wives tales, make the mom feel like any struggle is her fault, they don't support breastfeeding past a year, and more. They don't understand why a mom would not leave her breastfed baby for a week, tell them to pump and let others give a bottle to bond- not understanding how it will effect the breastfeeding relationship.

Two years after the initial curse of The Grudge was set in motion, Karen’s sister Aubrey (Amber Tamblyn) is sent to Japan by their mother in order to bring Karen back home. Karen is being held in a psychiatric ward because it is believed she killed her boyfriend two years ago by setting the house on fire. Once Aubrey arrives in Tokyo, she is exposed to the curse. A side plot of another American student in Tokyo develops: Allison is trying to fit in with the “cool kids”, so she follows them into the haunted house, and is exposed to the curse. Because Karen set the house on fire, the curse has grown stronger for some reason, and it is now out of the house, and following Allison wherever she goes.

In fact, actively working with musical sounds enhances neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to adapt and change. “A musician’s brain selectively enhances information-bearing elements in sound. In a beautiful interrelationship between sensory and cognitive processes, the nervous system makes associations between complex sounds and what they mean,” Nina Kraus, lead author of the Nature paper and director of Northwestern’s Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory, explained in a statement to the media. “The efficient sound-to-meaning connections are important not only for music but for other aspects of communication.”
But in a massive change of events, it’s been revealed this morning that some European investors are willing to pay the outstanding balance to FullTilt’s customers in return for a stake in FullTilt Poker’s parent company ‘Pocket Kings’.

But it has also been mentioned that Phil Ivey is considering backing down on his lawsuit if this deal can be made, as the customers he was fighting for, will finally receive there money.

Do we not meet in a kind of bubble, where everything evolves about Tango and where huge parts of our life are blanked? Do you know the name of person you just greeted so enthusiastically? Do you know, if your dance-partner has got siblings, a wife, a husband? Do you know her job and do you know her plans for the future? Do you know, if he sleeps well at night or if he‘s suffering from a disease? Most likely not. Because all we talk about is Tango. We meet, we dance, we chat... and we leave again. --
The kids and I got organized on Thursday morning for our road trip to Huzzah! We haven't done an extended road trip since the Lake Placid Ice Dance Championships last July...which may not sound like too long, but certainly feels like it. The car felt almost spacious, since we weren't hauling any of the terrain for the 40mm Rough Wooing games planned, just the figures. That left us with the room for a contingency game package, my case of 6mm DBA and Hordes of the Things armies. We arrived safely around 8:00 Thursday night, and settled in to discuss a few things with Ross.

The Winter Palace, by Eva Stachniak – I enjoyed this tale of two strong women in Imperial Russia – one being Varvara Nikolaevna, a “Ward of the Court” and palace spy, and the other being the young woman to whom Varvara ties her fortunes, a young German princess named Sophie. Sophie comes to court to marry the future Tsar, but finds intrigues and enemies abound there. With Varvara by her side, though, Sophie has one true ally to help her on the way to becoming Catherine the Great. The Winter Palace wasn’t a perfect read, but it was enjoyable and fun.

AG: There are people who are now coming out and recognizing the same thing, that this view is the correct way to go to explain quantum physics and also to develop science in the future. In other words, the present science has shown not only quantum paradoxes but also has shown real incompetence in explaining paradoxical and anomalous phenomena, such as parapsychology, the paranormal—even creativity. And even traditional subjects, like perception or biological evolution, have much to explain that these materialist theories don’t explain. To give you one example, in biology there is what is called the theory of punctuated equilibrium. What that means is that evolution is not only slow, as Darwin perceived, but there are also rapid epochs of evolution, which are called “punctuation marks.” But traditional biology has no explanation for this.

First, her story was that I pushed her. Then, because I've carried a knife of some kind on me since I was somewhere between eight and ten, that I stabbed her. There was a certain number of friends I gave my side of the story to and then let lie. Strangers who had at least the courtesy to ask would get a curt no and that was it. Remembering that lesson I learned from my mother about protesting too much played heavily into my approach of being thrown smack in the middle of a game of Machiavelli. Madam Lung advised me on a tactic I was already taking; don't rise to the bait, but rise above.

When in Germany she took notice of Der Blaue Reiter ("The Blue Rider," the German Expressionist group led by Wassily Kandinsky). She was particularly drawn to Franz Marc’s “triangulated space.” She has come to notice that her paintings are very concerned with space, so she has made them bigger and bigger. So they actually exist in space. Architecture also then comes into play. Another element is the thick stretcher frames. Even in the process of painting, from on the floor to the wall, these works engage space.

Midway through the third, as the teams traded furious rallies and scoring chances she said “I think I dislike Washington more than Boston. How can that be?” One word: Ovechkin. Firstly, he is Russian. Secondly, he has never lived up to his potential. This could have been a statement game for him, in which he proved once and for all he is one of the best players in the game by carrying his team to round two. Instead he was fighting for ice time. Thirdly, he is Russian.

Back in the day, I loved your song “How Do You Like Me Now.” I remember sitting in the living room on our old blue couches watching the music video with my mom more than ten years ago. I’ll be honest, I don’t like all of your stuff. “Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue” was a little too in your face for my taste. Just like any musician, most of your stuff I could take or leave with no strong feelings either way.

He loves numbers and is exploring career options involving math.
But in many places, the samples that ultimately freed DuPree, Woodard and Chatman would not have been saved.

Sixteen states have no preservation laws.

We were on cloud 9 after leaving. We got Swiss Chalet to celebrate. I got up at 5am to pee and had the terrible pain in my abdomen again, the same as I had a few weeks ago.

This great looking bunch is his, hers and “Ours” by marriage. My husband had two kids by a previous marriage and I had Cassie. What is unusual about them is that they were all raised as only children. Of course Cassie is an only, but when my husband and his ex divorced, he took the daughter, Rhe and his ex took their son, B. Trying to blend two families together is extremely hard especially when you have two teenage girls and a four year old boy to try and make a “happy family” out of. But somehow we managed to get them raised. There were countless happy times, and many times that were not so happy, some times that I wanted to throw in the towel and say forget it. But the thought of being without them hurt a whole lot more than anything that we fight about. It is so funny that the things that caused the most “family drama” seems so inconsequential now. The one thing that we where bless with, was that all of the kids wanted us to get married. Matter of fact, B was four years old and when the ceremony was to start, he hollers down the aisle for everyone to “Sit down and be quite, Dad and Momma J are gonna get married now!” We still laugh about that. Now they are young adults and we even have a new addition, Miss Poot aka: Peyton Rose our precious granddaughter, Rhe never said that she wanted to be a mommy, so when Peyton came along it was a shock and surprise.

Wednesday, July 14, 2010, my cabin the Cavaliers was hiking Mt. Giant. For me the mountain was hard and easy at the same time. The reason why it was hard is because of the steepness. The reason why the hike was easy is because I made my own short cuts and because there were some flat spots going up and down the mountain. Going down the mountain was pretty difficult. The reason why going down the mountain was difficult is because I had to use a lot of force with my legs. The reason why the hike going down the mountain was fun is because Ms. O’Leary was telling fun stories and I was telling some fun stories, and that made the hike pretty fun.

A man came slowly toward Peter with a revolver and told Peter to get on his knees. Peter collapsed and began to say the Ave Maria. He was still empty inside, he still half believed that he was about to enter the void of nonexistence, and for nothing but a stupid fable. He reached the words, “Sancta Maria Mater Dei,” when he heard a shot go off. There was no pain, all he saw was the woman, stretching her hands out in greeting, and he heard a whisper in his ear as he fell to the ground. “Quod infirmum est Dei, fortius est hominibus.”
Today, we continued our study of Gaia and her people. We are very ready to bring to completion what all of you in your own way have so magnificently begun. First contact is an inevitable event and is being carried out in answer to the call of Heaven. This call is now being answered and a new reality begun! Know, dear Ones, that the countless Supply and never-ending Prosperity of Heaven are indeed Yours! So Be It! Selamat Gajun! Selamat Ja! (Sirian for Be One! and Be in Joy!)
Aw, hell with it. I called an ambulance. Even if she's not danger-drunk, (and she might well be at this point), a ride in an ambulance and a spell in the Emergency Department will sober her up and hopefully drive home the point that drinking that much is dangerous and expensive. Plus while she's in the hospital, Dileve or whatever his name is can't show up and talk his way inside. The I went back and explained the facts of life to Romeo, who was still sitting on my bumper. I impressed up on him my belief that picking up drunk girls in bars and taking them home is probably not a smart thing to be doing. I also got his driver's license and ran his name, documenting it in case it turns out that someone drugged her in this bar. By the time the ambulance showed up, Steve had a pretty clear understanding of where I was coming from and what I thought that he was up to, and he had a car that was going to remind him of Stacy for a long time. (Hell, I could smell the puke ten feet away from it as the EMT's got her out of the car.)

So how does this relate to Laurie? She has been experiencing tingling in the soles of her feet. She is not overweight, sedentary, nor has a family history of diabetes. She is not tired and isn’t experiencing any increase in urination or weight loss. Her one bad habit is her diet: she does not meet the minimum daily recommended intake for fruits, vegetables and fiber. I ordered lab tests, including an A1C to give me information on her average blood sugar over a three-month time span. Surprisingly, her A1C was elevated at 5.8, correlating to an average blood sugar of 118. A healthier goal is an average blood sugar in the 80-90 range and A1C in the more normal 5.0 range.
Randy gives Christian another RKO, and once again, the table doesn’t break. I think the table is supposed to break here folks.
Members of a German news crew were held up at knifepoint off Long Street, while a BBC crew had equipment worth an estimated R120 000 stolen out of their vehicle while filming on Ou Kaapse Weg.
Why? Because this is the best dessert I have ever made, bar none. I highly recommend you go out and buy the book, or check it out from your library, and make this dish. Immediately. I am totally being the boss of you right now. Seriously, turn off your computer, get yer arse to the grocery store, and go make this. Oh wait. Maybe you should finish reading this post first. Yeah. But when you're done, call in sick to work, blow off any other commitments you've made and make this dessert. You won't be sorry. And, you can share it with the ones you love, or eat all six of them yourself. That's up to you. Who am I to judge?
I never ever know.
We did manage to have some fun though. Monkey See's birthday party was supposed to be today, but had to be cancelled due to our sickness. I did go and get her the cookie cake that she told me about. Remember when she said that Jesus was going to bring her a cookie cake through the rainbow? Well, she got a cookie cake with a rainbow on it. It was super cute.
Just raise taxes, running more business and jobs out of California.
But in an earlier blog, he stated that the serial killer had ‘clearly recognised the destructive effects of extreme multiculturalism’ in Norway.
My webinar on "Creating Research Plans" has just been processed and is ready for download. I discuss how to create your research plans, how to set goals, how to not set goals, when you are proving and when you are not, and other key concepts. Of course, we have a few charts as well. Our attempt is to be down-to-earth and practical. I realize that most genealogists are not going to write journal articles, however our research needs to be as thorough as possible and our analysis and method well-thought out or we're not going to get the best possible story on great-great-grandma that there is. This presentation is geared towards intermediate researchers, but advanced beginners might get some benefit from it as well.
I won’t vote Tory because I don’t agree with many of their policies. I won’t vote Lib-Dem, despite liking Clegg, Cable, Kennedy and Ming, because I don’t agree with their policies on Trident, the armed forces, the amnesty on immigration or their wish to join the Euro zone. So, I shall have a look at the Independent candidate and if I don’t like what I see, I shall vote by spoiling my ballot paper. I shall draw a pirate flag over the ballot paper. I have bought a nice fat black marker pen for the purpose this morning. It is sitting on my desk as I type. I shall practice drawing it quickly over the next few days.
Between coats of paint and firing of sculptures, I had a discussion. (below) Seemed as good a post as any I can come up with at this point. I worked since 7:30am and I are tired.
Ripe bananas - 4 (mashed).
Things around the homestead are still busy as usual. Can't seem to catch up but sure am blessed to wake up and enjoy each day no matter what the chores. Love having all the animals meeting me at their gates even if they are just wanting food. Hope you are having lots of blessings in your days!
