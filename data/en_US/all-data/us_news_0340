The kitchen also knows how to fry, whether it's the chile-marinated fish fingers ($11) flavored with ginger, cumin and garlic; chunks of Chennai organic chicken ($9.50), marinated in Straus yogurt spiced with cumin and coriander and fried to a bronzed perfection; or the chile and onion pakora that look a little like deep-fried tarantulas in a bowl. The onions are thinly sliced and coated in chickpea flour that gives them the unusual shape, then are tossed with a few flash-fried curry leaves.

Klinenberg urges readers to embrace and support the boom in solo living with its potential to strengthen individual self-worth and invigorate social and civic life. (He stresses that his study focuses only on urban settings and that the issues of living alone in rural settings involve other challenges and should be the subject of another study.) He cites examples of living situations that create a supportive community for singles of all ages. In Stockholm, for example, where 60 percent of all dwelling are occupied by someone living alone, he visited Fardknappen, a community-owned facility for singles over 40 that includes a slew of communal spaces — a library, a TV room, an exercise room, a carpentry room, weaving room, and, most significantly, a dining room where most of the residents meet to eat dinner and socialize. It's a place where people live happily "alone together."

"It's so hard to say that something is one-of-a-kind," says Dana Cowin, editor-in-chief of Food & Wine magazine. "But Red Rooster truly is. It's the food, it's the vibe.

Slithering between headstones, the Woodbridge cemetery snake is bad omen for graveyard visitors. Those who get too close to the purple-black serpent are doomed to die within an hour, at least according to 19th-century Jerseyans. Locals began fearing the portentous reptile after a bizarre incident at the funeral for a young woman named Lulu Lorch in 1896. Mourners were shocked when a 4-foot-long snake slinked into her grave and wrapped itself around her coffin. Twenty minutes later, Lorch's 29-year-old brother, William, died of heart failure, the New York Herald reported. The serpentine intruder apparently vanished after the episode. Of course, if the superstition is true, any witnesses likely expired before they could share the tale.

On board were a mix of media, investors and regular travelers, many of them experienced cruisers.
Road crews use these things - especially in the city of St. Louis, it seems - to cover what would otherwise be gaping holes in the street. Given the alternative of tumbling into an open ditch, this would seem noble enough. The trouble is that the plates seem to slip and slide in some spots. Last week, I saw where one of two side-by-side plates slid, leaving an opening between them just wide enough for a tire to fit. Memo to city: Work faster or just shut the lane down until the hole is filled.

To add to the frustration, the wines themselves weren't nearly as exciting as the food. When I looked over the list, I found that two of the four pairings were available by the glass for $11 and $13, and the third was sold by the bottle for $46. The only truly special wine was a taste of the 1945 Rivesaltes Terroirs de Crest et de l'Agly at dessert. When I noticed the small size of the pours and the caliber of the wines, I felt a little duped.

Though she's published more than 30 books, this is Lowry's first turn as a playwright. "That was quite a leap," she admits, but one made easier by the friendship and mutual respect she developed with OCT artistic director Stan Foote, who first suggested she adapt "Gossamer" for the stage. Having established a rapport during a visit to Lowry's home, Foote became someone she was comfortable taking suggestions from as she adapted to the very different craft of writing a play.

For another, analysts say, it would squelch whispers that the government has gone easy on Guzman while attacking his rivals.

But for all that, the World Cup will probably still come down to its heavyweights. Brazil and Argentina have looked sharp early on, and Netherlands is the one European side that's been dependable. By winning its group, Spain landed in a quarter of the bracket where it needs to worry about next-door neighbor Portugal but little else. The quarter of the bracket that includes Germany, England, Argentina and Mexico will do a good job of winnowing out contenders.

Coach Blake, are you really gonna make these poor young ladies sing Foster the People? "I love this song," says Blake, whose attempt to thin the herd meant either shedding shy and plump Lex or getting her to come out of her shell and defeat that obnoxious Jersey girl Charlotte (whom you could argue had her shot already when she signed a major record deal in 2008 with Geffen, toured the States eight times in a year and still couldn't make it happen). Charlotte's personality is charitably viewed as fun-loving and jokey but to my eyes she is fun-loving and joking with Lex the way the evil stepsisters were fun-loving and joking around Cinderella. When Blake and adviser Kelly Clarkson were out of earshot, Charlotte talked like a thug. "I want to beat Lex so bad. I want to destroy her." Although Char's nasally delivery would've eliminated her in any other battle thus far, she's eminently more watchable than lumpy Lex, lumbering across the stage like a beached Beluga. Anyone could've called this one. Blake might as well have had them sing the beloved polka, "I Don't Want Her, You Can Have Her, She's Too Fat For Me."
I was very interested in delving into the idea of these characters. Needless to say, "Porgy and Bess" has had its share of controversy from the very beginning. And a lot of people feel that an iconic work can't be touched. And yet there are also people out there who like to reinvestigate works. It's an iconic piece for a reason — it's a masterpiece, it's glorious. But for me, and I know other people out there too feel that a lot of these characters, some people call them archetypes, some people call them stereotypes. Some people look at it in a positive way and other people look at it in a negative way.

No previous court cases analyze the "minimum coverage" specifically. It's new in law. (It's actually not a new idea.

"A parent who can be silly or enjoy doing things that are kind of fun and exaggerated, I think gives children some really good coping skills," says Doris Bergen, a distinguished professor of educational psychology at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.

In TOKYO, the declines were aggravated by political turmoil, with Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara—one of the country's more popular politicians—resigning Sunday over illegal political donations from a foreign national.

It was disingenuous, he thought, to give the newspaper's endorsement in the primary to someone he knew darned well we wouldn't be endorsing in November.

The first big slug of cash, $25,000, came from Douglas County.

Sheila Mc Donnell's interest in absolutely everything led her to be a tireless champion of her Del Mar community, from the chamber of commerce and Kiwanis to founding the town's popular "Ugly Dog" contest. Her interest in absolutely everyone meant she did not stand on ceremony when inquiring into a person's life, whether it was about their sex life, their children's welfare, or where they bought their new carpet.

A coworker suggested lifting weights. Move over, Arnold Schwarzenegger. I rushed out and bought 5-pound weights. Within a month, I progressed to 8, but it must be true that muscle weighs more than fat. Instead of taking a nosedive, the needle on the scale had the audacity to inch up a notch. My sister-in-law suggested adding spices. The only thing that did was turn me into one hot mamma.

IUDs were a common contraceptive method in the United States in the 1970s, until a particular model, the Dalkon Shield, was linked to serious health problems, including infection, sterility and death.

"So," he asks, do the extra payments for Advantage plans "produce little value to beneficiaries, as Obama claims, or are the benefits they fund important to maintain, as Republicans would have us believe?

And though Frank himself might not have been born to the purple — a color he frequently wears, as part of a wardrobe that makes him look, in "HBO Real Sports" host Bryant Gumbel's eyes, like "an English fop" — his dad, also a snappy dresser, did indeed grow up in a stately and servant-filled manse.

Visminas was rushed back to JFK, where Landolfi had her sent straight to a hospice room. The tumor had grown five times in size in two months and the doctor didn’t think she’d survive more than 24 hours. Visminas’ family gathered around her — Chris and her kids, younger brother Nick in from California, their mother Roberta up from Florida. Gradually, Visminas lost consciousness and slid into a coma.

“I think it’s totally appropriate for the president to express to the American people the view that he has that he had an important role in taking out Osama bin Laden. I think politicizing it and trying to draw a distinction between himself and myself was an inappropriate use of a very important event that brought Americans together, which was the elimination of Osama bin Laden,” Romney told reporters after bringing six pizzas to a fire station that lost 11 men in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

Starting in a granite-based ponderosa forest, the trail steadily climbs 2,300 feet up to Spruce Mountain, then loops back down to the trailhead. Pines make up the predominant feature, but enough stands of Gambel oak exist to have inspired the town of Groom Creek's original name of Oakdale. A large forest of oaks on the trail's south edge weaves a cozy thicket with crooked, spindly trunks. Along Spruce Ridge, a sprinkling of white fir follows the trail; their frosty blue-green needles practically beam through the green cover.

GOP PRESIDENTIAL RACE: Mitt Romney added to his big lead in the race for convention delegates by winning Republican presidential primaries in North Carolina, Indiana and West Virginia. The former Massachusetts governor won at least 63 delegates, with 28 delegates in West Virginia still undecided. He has a commanding lead in the race for delegates with 919, just 225 delegates shy of the 1,144 he needs to clinch the GOP nomination — a gap he could close by the end of the month. The only other Republican still in the race, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, has at least 100 delegates, including six he won in North Carolina. Romney won all 27 delegates at stake in Indiana and 36 of the 52 delegates up for grabs in North Carolina. Results for the West Virginia delegates — 112 candidates were running for the 19 statewide spots — were expected to be late.

As more families hold steady at one child, Newman says it's most important to let go of stubborn, misguided stereotypes of onlies as lonely or socially maladjusted -- ideas that have been disproved by study after study for more than 30 years.
