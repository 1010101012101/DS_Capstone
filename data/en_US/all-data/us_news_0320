"Offensively, we were futile early," Oregon coach George Horton said. "The good news is we turned it around. The hitters got back to the middle of the field, they stayed behind the ball, and they did something that we hadn't been able to do -- score frequently in late innings.
Doumit hit a pair of solo homers to account for all of Minnesota's offense, but the Twins couldn't overcome Nick Blackburn's rough early innings in a 5-2 loss to the Seattle Mariners on Sunday.
In at least one recent case, the Orlando Magic did pay some pre-development costs for that city's arena, where the team is tenant in a city-owned facility. Team spokesman Joel Glass declined to say how much the Magic paid.
The Kings were also busy on that front Thursday. They signed 23-year-old forward Brian O'Neill to a one-year, entry-level deal and he will be assigned to their minor league affiliate in Manchester, N.H. O'Neill, coming off his senior season at Yale University, led his team with 21 goals and 46 points in 35 games.
Dudley's advisers describe themselves as more pragmatic than ideological. For example, state Sen. Frank Morse, R-Albany, widely regarded as the legislator with the closest ties to Dudley, has worked with Democrats on such issues as tax reform and civil unions for gays.
They don’t lack for modesty here. "The best barbecue in the United States" heralds the website. They also claim to have introduced rodizio to Newark back in 1987, when they opened. If you have the stomach for it, try the chicken hearts; they’re quite tasty. Tip: If you are expecting your meats to be accompanied by A1 or some other steak sauce, you are in the wrong place. Sauces and dry rubs are considered something close to sacrilege by Brazilians, who believe they hide rather than enhance the meat.
The FAA doesn't permit drones in national airspace on a wide scale out of concern that the remotely piloted aircraft don't have an adequate "detect, sense and avoid" technology to prevent midair collisions. Under FAA rules, any drone flying above 400 feet needs “certification or authorization” from the administration.
The state Department of Natural Resources said Tuesday it has chosen several projects for funding through the federal Recreational Trails Program.

Banks are expected to share some of the burden. One way would be for banks to repurchase Greek bonds after they expire, as French banks have indicated they may do. Many economists still expect it won't be enough.
"The economy is still in depression mode for those on the lower end of the economic scale," Blasi said. "For a lot of people, a vehicle is the last indoor space they're going to see until they start hitting the shelters."
"The waterways are really a dangerous place for recreation, especially swimming," said Thomas Granato, the district's interim director of monitoring and research, citing steep walls and barge traffic on some stretches. "It's not like a beach where you can stand up and walk out of the water if you're tired or get a cramp."

From Tokyo and Paris to San Francisco and New York, mourners created impromptu memorials outside Apple stores, from flowers and candles to a dozen green and red apples on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue.
Other issues, quite frankly, may be harder to bridge. But even on matters as sensitive as how to dismiss ineffective teachers, there appears to be room for compromise.
Remember when golf was thriving in St. Louis, when new courses were opening every summer, when Callaway drivers were teaching us that 'size matters," when everyone was channeling their inner Tiger Woods and when the schedule was lousy with USGA championships?

There are some Ivy Leaguers in the tournament. Please tell me you kicked their asses.
There's nothing wrong with using a jigger, and some of today's best bartenders do exactly that, though other equally accomplished mixologists use the free-pouring method. Here's how it's done: Fit a bottle full of water with any brand of pour spout - different styles pour at different speeds. Pour into the 1-ounce side of a jigger, counting in your head, until you have poured an ounce. Repeat. Repeat again. Soon you will know what number to count to in order to pour an ounce, and once you know your number you'll be able to accurately pour without a jigger for the rest of your life. Providing you use the same brand of pourer, that is.
And 40 percent say you can be a good Catholic without believing that the bread and wine really become the body and blood of Christ during mass - a core doctrine of Catholicism.

SAFETIES – Mitchell, Watkins, Dilbeck, LaGrone. Comment: Playmaker Mitchell – who looks like a guy who belongs in the NFL on his good days - has injury issues, but if he can get through the season injury free he’s got first team all-Pac12 potential. … Anthony Watkins grabbed the other starting safety spot and didn’t let go. The coaches like Dax Dilbeck, but he’s just coming back from major injuries, so we’ll see what kind of run he can make in the fall.

Can a similar mobilization of force, backed by a completed fence, work for conservatives today? Perhaps in the short run, but history makes such a challenge of doubtful long-term success.
Cornerback Chris Carr (back) and defensive tackle Arthur Jones (head) missed practice for the second straight day.
"The meatballs are incredibly popular," says executive chef Erik Cosselmon, who serves them in a traditional compote that changes with the season. "Right now it's being made with Greek olives and tomatoes," Cosselmon says, "but they are equally as good with a basic mix of oregano, olive oil and lemon juice." It's yet another nod to the simplicity of this universal dish.
Santorum got a rare hostile question from Wally Tuccini, 57. Tuccini said his mother was a Roman Catholic who opposed birth control, as does Santorum. When she delivered her eighth child, Tuccini said, the family was so poor they barely obtained essential medical care in time, and he asked why Santorum wants to reduce the government's social safety net.
Feliciano’s co-counsel, Neill Hamilton, sought to bar use of that evidence, arguing there is no proof that Hinds ever communicated with Feliciano about the possible firing. Discussions between Hinds and the church administrators are inadmissible “hearsay,” Hamilton argued.
She should have lived, she says, in the 1920s. Hallock hasn't seen Paris, but she fancies a writer's life spent in Left Bank bars and cafes. Hallock came of age instead in the 1960s, a bright daughter in one of Portland's better-known families.
Pringle once called those soft on the environment "green weenies." Tittel said Pringle’s become something worse — a "green bratwurst." Pringle rejects the swipe, but won’t top it.
Meanwhile, more than a dozen schools have been sued, mostly in state courts, by graduates saying they were misled. The lawyers who filed most of the suits said Wednesday they were seeking plaintiffs for 20 more schools.

The 6-foot-8 Griner was right at the center of the action as the Lady Bears took control. Every time Notre Dame made a run in the second half to cut into the deficit, Griner had an answer. She showed a wide array of post moves, hitting turnaround jumpers and hooks that the Irish had no way to stop - even when they collapsed around her.
Vanderford said she is more vigilant about the people around her.
Democrats, often to my dismay, are usually too willing to compromise. Republicans, at least since President Obama was elected, never do unless the public outcry is so great and they're forced to. And to imply that there is an equivalency between taking funds from public health versus a tax increase on the rich that is "off-limits" because almost all Republicans have signed a pledge not to raise taxes is laughable.
Portland has 21 days as of Dec. 20 to collect paperwork related to the City Council decision and forward it to the state land-use board, said board spokeswoman Kristi Seyfried.

Ohio Department of Natural Resource records for 2010 show a lull in new well drilling activity across Ohio, likely brought on by wholesale natural gas prices, which have dropped more than 50 percent since 2008. But many see a drilling boom on the horizon as Big Energy fans out across the eastern Ohio countryside gobbling up land atop energy-laden Utica and Marcellus shale formations as fast as they can get leases inked.

The kitchen also puts together a handsome shellfish platter, with crab, shrimp and oysters.
Even though he won the un- official Chevron World Challenge last December, this was meaningful for Woods — a full tour event against a strong field and a performance so clean, he was never seriously challenged on the back nine.
Gas is still leaking at Elgin from a point some 4,000 meters (13,200 feet) below the seabed into a well bore that had previously been shut down. A sheen of gas condensate is visible on the surface of the sea around the leak and the potentially explosive gas cloud hangs around the well's platform. The most recent estimates from the U.K. government peg the volume of hydrocarbon spilled at 3.8 metric tons. The shutdown of the area has taken around 3% of U.K. North Sea production off the market, according to the energy ministry.

This is why you want to create a paper trail when you're dealing with any company. Priceline couldn't deny something that a representative wrote, so if you could show them an email in which they agree to refund the entire package (and by the way, $3,208 for a Hawaii package is a great deal) then you'd have a much stronger case.

Economists closely watch weekly claims, which are considered a gauge of the pace of layoffs and an indication of employers' willingness to hire.
Still, Wilcox said there was no immediate evidence of a sexual encounter gone wrong, of suicidal intent, or that Williams' death was linked to a supposed interest in bondage. She said, however, that tales about his sex life could have been fueled in an attempt to "manipulate the evidence."
Romney on Monday endorsed the $6 billion move to forestall the interest rate increase, even before Obama had arrived at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Boehner quickly set a vote, using unspent money from Obama's unpopular health care law to pay for the plan. By Friday, the issue was mostly deflated.

Aquarist: The survival of animals that live in public aquariums worldwide depends on professional aquarists. These people know more about what makes marine critters happy than anyone else, and I know this from experience. Working alongside aquarists at Birch Aquarium, I've learned an incredible amount about corals over the past few years.
Comedies are often the most talked-about movies of the year, but even the good ones are often overlooked when it comes to awards season. Hoping to buck the trend is "Bridesmaids," the raunchy, female-driven ensemble that racked up close to $170 million at the box office this summer, spawned a slew of copycat scripts and served as a touchpoint for a women-in-comedy discussion.
After Keely's free throws, Alex Abreu was fouled before he could attempt a tying 3-pointer. After making his first free throw, his second bounced around before dropping through the rim while the clock incorrectly started, forcing officials to stop action to figure out the situation and make sure a Zip didn't touch the bouncing ball and actually tie the game.

Desperate to see playoff success, Knicks fans were loud early, chanting "Beat the Heat! Beat the Heat!" but the Knicks gave them little to cheer about once the game started. They made one basket in the first 5 minutes and fell behind by as many as nine points, but then shut down the Heat from the field after Bosh's basket with 4:59 left and tied it at 19 by period's end.
"As the economy went into recession, grass seed followed that market slump," said Mark Mellbye, a professor at Oregon State University and head of the extension service for Linn County. Sales fell from $508.7 million in 2008 to $319.7 million in 2009, according to OSU data.

Branson, known as the live music capital of the world, is turning 100 this year, and is celebrating in lots of ways that might just make a trip there even more fun.
But, above all, "My Faraway One" is a love story, told by artists who inspired and energized each other — and whose differences in age and temperament could seem insurmountable. In a letter written in 1917, Stieglitz asked O'Keeffe if she wanted to have his child. She responded affirmatively, but nearly a year later he wrote that any child they had "would be drowned to death" along with its parents because he didn't "know how to be part of the big game."
Jarman's had opportunities to return, but only briefly. The Cribs played Lollapalooza in 2010, back when former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr was part of the band. Something of a drifter and a hired gun since the dissolution of his first and most iconic group, Marr - after a chance meeting with the Jarmans at a Portland, Ore., barbecue - joined the Cribs for the recording of "Ignore the Ignorant" and its subsequent tour.
CLEVELAND, Ohio - A 38-year-old Strongsville man was convicted of murder Friday after a seven day trial in the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court.
He's working with the University of Akron's renowned polymer chemists to try to spin synthetic spider silks. If researchers someday succeed in mimicking the real thing, it might show up in stronger artificial tendons or ligaments, longer-lasting heart valves, self-healing paints that resist dings, and tougher bulletproof vests.
That might wind up being the case, but there are a lot of moving parts to this one. Firstly, there's always the chance a player the Giants don't expect to get to them slides down unexpectedly (see: Amukamara, Prince). Then, there's the matter of finding a willing suitor and agreeing on the right price. And the Giants don't want to go too far back and risk losing out on the block of players they're targeting.
Nashville goalie Pekka Rinne was brilliant in the Predators' first-round series against Detroit, allowing just nine goals in five games. But he has given up nine goals to the Coyotes in two games, and his save percentage is .857.

His tiny kitchen is like an artist's studio. He transforms ingredients into creations that satisfy his professional sensibilities. His only help comes from one assistant, one dishwasher and one waiter, who handle the entire dining room, including the seven-seat counter that fronts the diamond-embossed stainless steel wall and galley. Pine bookshelves top the row of wood booths opposite the counter, and Leary has created an informal lending library (the chef was an English literature major at Wheaton College). His favorite author is James Joyce, which may explain his egalitarian leanings.

The two people in the SUV were injured.

The bill ultimately died. And the St. Louis utility suspended efforts to get a permit for a second nuclear reactor. But the months of television ads, harsh rhetoric and political jockeying that characterized the debate did make a mark, providing the impetus for the Missouri Energy Initiative, a new statewide think tank for energy issues.

1.) General manager Brian Cashman made a calculated gamble when he traded for Pineda in January. Essentially, he sacrificed his top prospect in Jesus Montero with the idea that the Yankees would enjoy several years of elite-level pitching production without having to pay free agent prices. Now, the Yankees have no idea whether they'll ever see the pitcher they thought they were getting.
The gamesmanship started days ago when Coyotes captain Shane Doan gushed on about how well the Kings have been playing. He suggested that at least four LA players should merit consideration for the Conn Smythe Trophy, given to the MVP of the playoffs.
"It's coded into political 'otherness' — he's a socialist, he's dangerous, maybe a Muslim," she said. "I think down underneath there's a lot of race bias, it's just that they've figured out ways to channel that into seemingly race-neutral codes."

In my view, the evidence argues against that, but at least a coherent case for hands off could be made. That would be an honest, straightforward policy. Instead, the president, basking in the sanctity of the Holocaust Museum, proclaims his solemn allegiance to a doctrine of responsibility — even as he stands by and watches Syria burn.
The grant program currently waives tuition costs for about 120,000 low-income students, including about half of the university's 40,000 postgrads.

The Atlanta Regional Commission’s planning staff released its suggested plan Thursday, July 7, for getting its transportation wish list cut down to $11.5 billion.
"From the very beginning, Lindsey's footwork was very good and so was her decision making," Mulligan said. "I think that reminds me a lot of Christina. She has really good footwork and she makes good decisions with the ball. When she feels the double team, she knows to give it up. When she's one-on-one, she knows how to draw the foul. In terms of her poise on the court, that was something Lindsey always seemed to have."
"I'm doing this because I like it," he said.
The tax credit has also been made refundable, meaning that individuals with no tax liability will simply get a check. The amount of the Colorado tax credit designed to encourage this environmentally correct behavior is — brace yourself — as much as $6,000 per car. That, of course, is on top of the federal tax credit of $7,500.

Can Christina PLEASE Give it a Rest? It seems her new lot in life is to be a bee in Tony Lucca’s bonnet. Let’s observe: She said she had cleared the song “How You Like Me Now” for her contestant, Moses (and we all know how he turned out), and if “The Voice” didn’t work out, Tony and Adam could just start a Britney Spears cover band.

Sadly, Mateo passed away in July 2010 at nine months old.
My husband says that I'm a different person when I travel-and that's a good thing. When he says I'm a "good traveler," he probably doesn't mean what most people would by that. I do not pack light. I do not have a keen sense of adventure.

I wouldn't last an hour on Man vs. Wild. No, I'm not that kind of good traveler, not at all.

Also nifty is an all-new flip-and-fold feature for the rear seats that's standard on all CR-Vs. When cargo trumps rear passengers, owners can pull a lever in the cargo area or a strap by the rear seat cushion. In a quick motion with all the choreography of a Russian ballet but none of the blisters, the rear seat cushion flips up, the headrests flip down, and the seat back folds to the floor. The result is an almost flat cargo area that swallows just under 71 cubic feet of gear, a small decrease from the previous CR-V.

Tim Brown, Yahoo! Sports: "What Cuban-Americans have today is one more sympathetic ear. Maybe they don't want Ozzie Guillen in that club. Maybe he doesn't deserve their forgiveness, their friendship, their patronage. That's between them and Ozzie. But, the man who sat before them Tuesday, he seemed to be honest. He was not trying to save his job. He was not trying to salvage ticket sales. He looked like a guy who'd screwed up, whose ego had rarely before allowed him to be wrong, but knew it this time. He'd hurt the people he lives with. He'd been flogged publicly, deservedly. What he had left he laid out in Spanish and English – an apology, a promise to be more sympathetic, a hope that his harmful words do not cast him as a bad person."

So what it comes down to is the product on the field, and there are a lot of ways to go at it. ... When we acquired the Nuggets, we were abysmal. I would say they were certainly pretty bad. (But) I think we've brought them along (the Nuggets have not had a losing season since 2002, while reaching the playoffs eight consecutive seasons), and the way we did that was we concentrated on the personnel. We got a head coach (George Karl) we could trust and had the intelligence and energy and the track record, quite frankly. He'd proven he could do it.

Lincoln County's population has grown by 35 percent over the last decade, the biggest jump in the region. Conversely, the city of St. Louis saw its population drop by 8 percent - most of those children - and has the smallest average household size, at 2.16 people. The average in Missouri is
It all started innocuously enough. I was at a private drinkup at Kink.com and walked over to say hi to one of the company's most famous bondage models, Madison Young (madisonbound.com).

Complicating Bernanke's reappointment is his need for 60 votes to overcome a procedural hold on Bernanke's confirmation placed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who has been one of his leading critics.
5) Receiving no response to a post is painful. I've asked myself this riddle a number of times: if my blog post appears on the internet and no one reads or responds, do I cease to exist? This leads to deeper questions: What's my motivation for writing? Did I not get enough attention as a child? How pathetic am I?

The heart muscle must receive nutrients and oxygen to function. If this supply is limited by blockages in the coronary arteries, it can cause the heart muscle to weaken. If this has not resulted in permanent scarring from a heart attack, it is potentially reversible. With improved blood flow through bypass surgery or coronary intervention (commonly with stents), heart strength can be restored. Sleep apnea (low oxygen levels when patients stop breathing during sleep) is another reversible cause of CHF.

AKRON, Ohio — The Plain Dealer series, "Payrolls and Politics," outlined the practice by then-Recorder Patrick O'Malley and then-Auditor Frank Russo of giving jobs to people with personal or political connections.

Like many farm-dependent communities throughout the nation, Dore fell victim to changing agricultural practices and a harsh rural economy.

Star Tavern, 400 High St., Orange; (973) 675-3336. The secret to the great thin-crust pizzas at Star?

The pies are taken from the pans and finished off directly on the oven surface; in all, pizzas take 12 to 15 minutes to cook in the 650-degree oven.

Missouri trout ($29) was a compositional wonder both from culinary and visual perspectives. The trout was headless but otherwise left whole after cleaning, stuffed with lacianato kale (the alligator-skin kind) and pine nuts. Three shavings of the milder summer form of truffle sat on top. But perhaps the most remarkable part was a paper-thin wrapper of Missouri-made Berger country ham that was as tight as a second skin over half the fish. As with everything else we tried, the interplays of flavor and texture were outstanding.

What's half-baked? The carbohydrates tend to be universally bland. The Cajun dirty rice leans so far into rice territory that it is merely stained, as opposed to downright dirty.

The garlic and ginger make for a pungent dish, well seasoned with salt. Only the anemic tomatoes were out of place, contrary to Maharani's claim to stay seasonal. Still, it's a very fresh dish that makes an excellent addition to the table.

11. Keegan Bradley, United States -- After finishing no worse than a tie for 27th at the Masters in his first 10 tournaments of the year, Bradley shot 73-72--145 to miss the cut by three strokes in the Zurich Classic of New Orleans. It was the first time he failed to reach the weekend since the Deutsche Bank Championship last August during the PGA Tour playoffs, and it ended his streak of cuts made at 12. ... Bradley is going to give the Wells Fargo Championship another shot despite shooting 74-72--146 last year to miss the cut at Quail Hollow by two strokes. He was done in by going double bogey-bogey to finish the back nine on Friday after starting on No. 10 to record a 2-over-par 38 and couldn't save his weekend with a bogey-free 34 on the front. It was one of 10 missed cuts in 2010 for the eventual PGA Tour Rookie of the Year. ... Keegan's missed cut last week can be traced to one hole at TPC Louisiana, No. 4, which he played in 5-over-par for the two days. He drove into the water on Thursday en route to a double-bogey 6, but Saturday it was even worse. Bradley again hit his drive into the water and, after taking a drop, hit his second shot into an unplayable lie to get tagged with another penalty stroke on his way to a triple-bogey 7. That came as he was finishing round two on the front nine and seemingly en route to making the cut after an eagle at No. 18. He was 4-under for the other 34 holes.

In the end, it's hard for me to say with any authority whether Nick's Cove and Cottages is a good value, because I don't regularly wade into the deep end of the price spectrum.

Paulie and Pauline: The idea for this project originated during a photo shoot in New York City with porn legend Adam Glasser (a.k.a. Seymore Butts, the "Tushy Man") and his co-star Mari Possa, whose budding off-screen relationship had been chronicled in the Showtime television series "Family Business." Adam and Mari asked to take a break a couple of hours into the shoot. Jet-lagged and exhausted from their busy promotional tour, they spooned together on the bed in their hotel suite. Instead of dozing off as we expected, they talked softly and caressed each other like two new lovers who were enjoying a moment alone during a rare break in their busy lives. With their nod of approval, we continued shooting. There was nothing staged or performative about the way Adam and Mari reached for each other. No production assistants or makeup artists darted about. We did our best to remain invisible while attempting to capture their intimacy. The chemistry and ease between them was apparent. They smiled. They laughed. They were surprisingly quiet.

But in November I sent two significantly sized checks from my WF account. One arrived. One did not. When I tried to stop payment on the check that did not arrive, the service people on the phone did not seem to be able to understand. I did not realize this was due to the fact that they were on an alien mothership and spoke Chingqwah. Finally, I got them so far as to be able to say "We can not stop payment on this check." No doubt this phrase had been barely memorized from their earth lexicon. Never mind if I asked why not, or whether they were going to pay me two months' interest on my funds that they've had access to, and I have not, or if I could speak to a supervisor.
