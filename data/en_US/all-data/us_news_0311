When Santana said “they” he was referring to the Detroit Tigers, who defeated the Mets, 9-0. He could just as easily have been referring to his teammates, who performed miserably.

Equal-weighted ETFs have their drawbacks. For one, they skew an S&P 500 fund more toward midcap stocks because they take an equal allocation in every stock in the index. That will cause the ETF to lag behind if large stocks take off. With a 0.4% expense ratio, the Guggenheim ETF is also pricier than typical market-cap-weighted ETFs. But those factors are more than offset by eliminating the risks of concentrating in one stock, Ms. Berenyi says.

Calling in to "Today" on Monday to discuss her appearance, Palin said she hoped "we won't bore viewers with too much in-depth political talk."

"I've done a lot of things in my life, but this is the most fulfilling," Katie says. "Handing people a dog and having them come back with an empty plate saying, ‘Oh, my God. That was so good,’ that's the best feeling.”
Our second meal, on a Saturday night, unfolded in the smaller side dining room with arcaded mirrors and a somewhat crisper finish than the main room. (Tatsu’s also has a couple of tables in the tiny bar area, which looked like it could be a fine and cozy setting to spend the two hours or more that a three-course meal can last here.)

My opinion: I was surprised to hear that during his trip, Obama will not stop in Colombia, the closest U.S. ally in the region in recent years. U.S. officials tell me that is because Obama will attend the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, in April 2012, and will most likely stay on for an official visit to that country. Maybe so.

Sandra Rogers, 55, maintained her innocence in 2004 while entering into an "Alford" plea agreement, which acknowledged that prosecutors had sufficient evidence to prove her guilt, Judge John Phillips said.

Rosés are one of the best summer wines around. Their recent history was dominated by the infamous white Zinfandel - which is not a bad wine, despite the fact that wine geeks turn up their noses in its presence. But there is much more to rosés than white Zinfandels, and their history is long and glorious. The color can range from a light tan to a vibrant deep pink. Styles range from bone-dry to slightly sweet. (Note: Most are dry.) This makes them perfect for almost any occasion.

Born in 1914 in Chicago, Veeck learned baseball from his father, William Sr., who became president of the Chicago Cubs. Bill Jr. sold popcorn at Wrigley Field and even suggested planting ivy on the brick outfield walls. Veeck pricked baseball’s stuffed shirts with stunts that fans loved, most famously sending Eddie Gaedel, a dwarf, to bat in 1951. He did far more: He made Larry Doby the first black player in the American League and gave the near-mythical Negro League star Satchel Paige, who was at least 41 years old, his chance to pitch in the majors. And he talked Harry Carey into singing “Take Me Out To The Ballgame” during the seventh inning stretch, thus creating an instant baseball tradition.

Posey is a cautious man, publicly, not the type to make demands through the media or to kick down the manager's door.

The second assertion, that Gary Rosenblatt is akin to Walter Cronkite, I will recast Lloyd Bentsen's famous remark about Dan Quayle comparing himself toJohn F. Kennedy. I knew Gary Rosenblatt.

Weber's new "Time to Grill" cookbook sprinkles lessons for halibut ceviche and apricot mascarpone tarts among traditional steak and chicken recipes.

Wain's directorial efforts have been pretty solid, including the brilliantly bizarre cult-classic "Wet Hot American Summer" and the thoroughly enjoyable "Role Models." Here Wain does deserve some credit for keeping the tone consistent throughout, so as the movie gets increasingly raunchy these moments actually seem organic and not forced for a cheap laugh.

"I was actually kind of down after the first day," said Kopera, who placed fifth last season. "I was in 20th place and I didn't do so great, but I knew after I shot 670 in the first series this morning, I was going to place high.

View full sizeAP Photo/Universal PicturesIn this film image released by Universal Pictures, animated character Lorax, voiced by Danny Devito, is shown in a scene from "Dr. Seuss' The Lorax."Foreboding and unabashedly activist, "The Lorax" is Dr. Seuss' contribution to environmental literature. Published during the nascent green movement of the early 1970s, the book is a whimsical, indignant broadside against poisoning the planet for profit, pitting the Truffula-tree-chopping entrepreneur the Once-ler against a shortish, oldish, mossy creature called the Lorax, whose appeals for conservation go unheeded until it's too late. While not exactly a delightful read, "The Lorax" is poignant, powerful and, as with nearly all things Seuss, ever quotable.

Our beef with beef gets bigger every week: The triple threat of high saturated fat and iron levels, plus HAAs -- byproducts of cooking meat at high temps -- promotes many cancers, heart failure, impotence and memory dysfunction. PLUS, a new supersize study links eating red meat to a shortened lifespan. But the meat-processing industry itself has handed you another reason to steam some veggies and grill those portabella mushrooms. Ta-da! Pink slime. What is it? Semi-liquefied scrap meat or trimmings. To ensure this slurry -- which the industry calls lean, finely textured beef -- isn't loaded with nasty bacteria, it's treated with ammonium hydroxide (window cleaner). The spritz of gas is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration; the National Institute of Health has a webpage on ammonium hydroxide poisoning. Go figure. Pink slime was developed as an addition to pet food, but about 70 percent of ground beef sold in the U.S. had it mixed in. Luckily, the recent public outrage was enough to get most American grocery stores to stop that practice (at least temporarily). McDonald's, Burger King and Taco Bell have stopped using the filler, as have many public-school systems. So what's your next move?

Mercer County claims that realignment of the intersection is necessary for two reasons: capacity and safety. Regarding capacity: The county claims it needs to move a great number of vehicles through the intersection, yet it has at least twice offered permanent closure of the bridge/roadway as a solution, and at least twice offered to give the bridge (allowing an uncertain future) to Hopewell Township. If capacity were truly an issue, neither of these options would have been deemed viable, much less offered outright. Repeatedly.
The differences were more jarring on Richard Strauss’ tone poem “Death and Transfiguration” as the balance among the instruments felt out of whack.

The fallout falls on Tebow. He won a playoff game against Pittsburgh. He deserves a shot to start in another NFL city. While Hall of Fame tight end Shannon Sharpe tweeted that answered prayers for Manning was proof Tebowing works, anybody who cheered for the Broncos in 2011 should feel gratitude and sympathy for Tebow. This is a tough business. His faith will serve Tebow well now after what could be regarded as an act of betrayal.

Still, Favre looked skittish at times and was hit on eight of his first 10 dropbacks, taking three sacks. One of them lost 12 yards, on third and 7 at the Dallas 30, when he did a pirouette instead of getting rid of the ball. That put the Vikes out of field-goal range. But Harvin's huge return and Peterson's short touchdown plunge put the Vikings ahead 21-14, and the defense did enough to preserve an important victory. Favre played down another low-production performance.

Fire department officials said the fire was not as bad as it could have been because much of the plane’s fuel was dumped just before the crash.

And because the plane crashed on a weekday afternoon, many residents were at work or away on errands.

And if the governor and the Legislature don't start funding higher education, California is not going to recover from this slump in the economy."
The more I thought about this situation, the prouder I was of Harry for not being "cutie cat" making nice with the people where he boards. (On one level, why should he? He doesn't do that at home either; he's his own cat person --as the scratches on my hands can illustrate).
It's not the life-or-death pressure she faces in the ICU, Norelli said, but she considers rape "life changing." She's hoping she can bring all of her skills, and maybe her youth, into service for the women who come to GBMC — often from area schools. GBMC saw about 150 cases last year, and about 60 percent of the victims are ages 13-34. One-third of victims say alcohol was involved and more than half know the alleged attacker.

It's been a couple of months since SOPA and PIPA became hot-button buzzwords of the Internet. How best to describe what they do? It's tempting to come up with an analogy to describe what it's meant to do and how it's meant to go about it. But that's dangerous; I'm convinced that an over-simplified analogy is what caused it to make as much progress as it did.

Harris' death has pushed Detroit toward adopting changes much like those other cities have already embraced. The new approach urges firefighters to assess fires before rushing in. If the building cannot be saved and they are certain nobody is inside, they should fight the fire from the exterior to limit their own risk. In Flint, such a change has cut the number of firefighter injuries in abandoned building blazes by a quarter, and reduced injury time by more than a third.
The hunting of bears and bobcats (not mountain lions) is legal but highly regulated in California. There are quotas, seasons and various limitations, such as a ban on killing cubs or mother bears with cubs in tow. The state does allow hunters to deploy dogs, often outfitted with radio telemetry devices on their collars, to track bears or bobcats. Hunting groups and American Kennel Club officials say this is a sporting, athletic endeavor for hunters and hounds alike. Animal welfare advocates, including the Humane Society of the United States, which sponsored the bill being introduced by state Sen. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance), say this practice is cruel to bears and unsporting.

To appreciate "Men of Fire," you need to start not in Dartmouth's art museum but in its Baker Library. That's where the 24-year-old Pollock made pilgrimage in 1936 to see Orozco's 24-panel mural "The Epic of American Civilization" (1932-34), a sweeping history of the Mexican people. Its darkly symbolic and ritualistic content made a strong impression on the younger artist. Dartmouth also owns Orozco's studies for the mural, included in the Hood's show.

But the Power & Light District stands out because it was financed through a technique that seemed like it would pay for itself. Kansas City directed future sales and property taxes in the district to pay back the $295 million in bonds that the city issued for the project, which went toward infrastructure and to directly support the development. In the event there weren't enough taxes, the city agreed to pick up the difference.

City leaders -- the elected officials who passed the new fee, although you have to admire Keil's willingness to take the blame for her bosses -- should have knocked on doors to explain the new charge.

The Quakes have sold 20,000 tickets for a June 30 game against the Los Angeles Galaxy at Stanford Stadium. They expect to attract more than 40,000. The team had 41,000 at Stanford last year for a matchup against the New York Red Bulls but had sold only 10,000 tickets by early May.

Will they? The Buckeyes are No. 11 in the latest BCS rankings released Sunday night, No. 8 in both polls and No. 16 in the computer ratings. That BCS ranking puts Ohio State behind five other one-loss teams -- Alabama, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and LSU. With three games remaining, only a win at Iowa would give the Buckeyes a major boost, so the ultimate goal is almost assuredly out of reach.
øIt was years later I learned from my parents that their method of traveling was about more than being convenient. It had everything to do with protecting the family and keeping us safe.

In this week's edition of the Howard County Times I previewed the upcoming Thomas Johnson-River Hill 3A state championship football game, Saturday at 7 p.m. at M&T Bank Stadium in downtown Baltimore. That story took more of a narrative approach, but here's a more detail-oriented, point-by-point look at the upcoming game.
One difference between these two great players is that Robinson was new to this level of play this season, while Sullinger was repeating what he did as a freshman. Sullinger became the first back-to-back All-American since North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough repeated in 2009, and the first to win first-team All-American as a freshman and sophomore since LSU's Chris Jackson 22 years ago.

Not all quarterback numbers will be created equal. But if Graham avoids a Williams sack attempt and beats Howard with a throw, then you have something. Also, enjoy the fact that the quarterbacks should be taking hits. Starters such as Pryor and Troy Smith were typically protected from tackling by wearing black jerseys in the spring game.
