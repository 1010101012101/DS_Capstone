At the heart of Gelb's film is the relationship between Ono and his two sons. Yoshikazu, the elder of the two, has worked at Sukiyabashi for decades (he's in his 50s now) and is expected to succeed his father when he eventually steps down, or dies. Takashi apprenticed with his father and then went off to open Sukiyabashi Roppongi, a mirror-image sushi bar with its own legion of devotees. (Takashi explains that he is right-handed, his father left-handed, and thus the opposing layouts of the two restaurants.) Takashi seems less burdened by expectations. He sports a smile that suggests that working on his own, out from under his father's shadow, has been liberating.
Altman has compiled a 45-28 record in his two seasons in Eugene, including two postseason appearances, but he hasn't taken the Ducks to the NCAA Tournament. Will 2013 be the year the Ducks return to the Dance?

"Despite the fact that Joplin and Missouri are clearly worse off, we don't subtract this destruction from GDP," said David Mitchell, an economist at Missouri State University. "But we do add people's work to recreate the infrastructure, homes and buildings that were destroyed. In this sense, GDP can be a poor measure of a country's economic well-being."

“The veteran guys like Murph (Tuesday) night — I had no problem putting Daniel Murphy at first base because he’s played there,” Collins said. “We’re trying to get Lucas to feel comfortable in right field and I don’t feel comfortable with taking a guy and bouncing him to left field.”
I moved to San Diego in 1972 to take my first post-college/Army job and remember clearly a Tri-City scandal brewing that was well documented over several news cycles both on television and by The San Diego Union/Evening Tribune. Every year to two since then, this political subdivision has found itself in some contretemps of one type or another; none of which have reflected well on the board members nor those with whom they have chosen to associate. All these stories have been well-documented by respected media sources and all have reflected badly on the board regardless of whether the issues dealt with health care delivery or monetary machinations.
"The NCAA staff and enforcement staff will be the first to say we have agreed to summary disposition," the former major conference administrator with a background in compliance said. "If the institution says it first, it (upsets) the NCAA. The inference is the school is running the investigation. When the institution chooses not to confirm that, don't read into that. They will try like hell to not do something to put them in a bad light with the NCAA."

Blazers interim coach Kaleb Canales had called a time out from the sideline with 2.9 seconds left, giving the Blazers one final chance to end this forgettable season on a high note.

Hickson, gathered a pass and launched a shot at the buzzer over Blake Ahearn.

The popular dean of the University of Baltimore School of Law said he was forced to resign this week, and in an unusual move, he used a widely circulated email to air internal tensions over the university's spending of law school revenues to subsidize other programs.
City union leaders, who earlier this year rebuffed a city request that employees give up pay raises negotiated in years past in exchange for funding pension reform and an early retirement program, attacked Villaraigosa as out of touch with average workers.

That means a longer fight - especially against Gingrich, who had to recover from his campaign's near-implosion in June - leaves Romney in a stronger position.
Of course this is a question that might not be of the utmost concern in today's more liberated societies, where women can work, and inherit property, and engage in premarital sex without life-scarring scandal. But in class-conscious England of the early 1800s, marriage meant survival for most women. And this is what sets the anxiety level at fever pitch in Jane Austen's often comic but deceptively serious novel Pride and Prejudice.

Reuben recovers from the ordeal with remarkable speed and realizes physical differences. His eyes are a deeper, darker blue now, he was a tall kid but he's even taller now, his hearing is incredibly acute, and he feels no fear even staring a large, surly man in the face. Then, the wolf change happens, and Reuben is driven to hunt down evildoers of all stripes — abusive husbands, sadistic kidnappers — while the local media crackle with stories of a mysterious man-wolf who seems like a shaggy superhero.

Home prices plunged by almost a third in major U.S. cities after the housing bubble burst, and the glut of foreclosures has kept the market from rebounding.

Harbach deftly ratchets up the drama as Henry spends much of the book battling a wrenching string of errors that will ring familiar to baseball fans who remember the bizarre struggles of Steve Sax, Chuck Knoblauch or Rick Ankiel. As he spirals into fury, depression and near-madness with the loss of his identity, the tangled relationships around him grow steadily more complicated. Tipping points are reached concerning Affenlight and his lover, the codependent athletic tie between Mike and Henry, and a sweet but messy relationship between Mike and Affenlight's sharp but rudderless daughter — the only female to rise out of Harbach's Melvillean "Paradise of Bachelors."

While many speakers acknowledged the power of charter schools to transform the education of some students in failing urban districts, much discussion centered on the impact the schools have in suburban communities such as East Brunswick and Princeton.
Ironically, the government had spent much of the pre-digital 1980s and 1990s filing lawsuits arising from the wholesale model. The issue then was also technological change—advances in supply-chain logistics that created the then-giant booksellers including Waldenbooks, B. Dalton and Crown Books. Independent booksellers complained that publishers gave them a lesser discount than the volume discount they gave big chains. Years of antitrust litigation were a total waste of time: Almost every superstore has succumbed to competition from online sellers, chiefly Amazon.

Randy Foye (11.0 ppg, 2.2 apg) has transformed himself into the spot-up shooter the Clippers thought they had in Chauncey Billups before Billups was lost for the season.

So let us plant a little flag for and mark with a yellow highlighter the thing Rep. Raul Labrador said Sunday on "Meet the Press": "it wouldn't matter" if President Obama were a Muslim. And if it seems rather much to be handing out medals for such a modest statement of principle, well ... the principle has been under fire for so long that even a modest statement feels momentous.

"He asked me to play for him after the concert," he says. "And he took me under his wing -- it meant so much to able to connect with someone like him."
But the Dinner with Monroe conversation takes another turn, as the blutbad shares some inside scoop. Not to be awkward or anything, but you know those myths about humans getting special, er, benefits from rare animal parts? Well, that's actually true when it comes to human parts and creatures. "Our exotic animals are you," Monroe says, continuing to note that human testicles -- not Nick's specifically, but anyway -- have a special "enhancement" effect on creatures. Not that Monroe has ever needed any such help. Of course not. He's Monroe.

However, that doesn't mean your history with cancer is of no issue. Many insurers will ask if you've been treated for cancer at any point in your life, Grodsky says. When the answer is yes, it's a good bet the rates you're quoted will be higher than for someone who's never been diagnosed.

A developer offered to build a $300 million mall at the Kingsbridge Armory, using $50 million in tax subsidies, but balked at Diaz's demand that all future jobs there pay $10 an hour or more, which would have made the project uneconomical. So Diaz got council members to nix the project. And goodbye 2,200 jobs.

There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America -- there's the United States of America." And we cherish everyone's ethnic background, beliefs and culture.

Then when 9/11 happened, he tried to leave college, but his uncle talked him out of it. After college, he signed up.”

The show raises important, pertinent questions about how such work is perceived — and misperceived, Brace says. "Even if your goal might be to make a transcendent visual statement, it's hard work and a long process. You're in a space that's focused on goals and on problem-solving.

... When I looked out, the pale moon was shining through the smoke from the fires just starting and I halted in surprise, thinking, I suppose, that she should not be there; that by all tokens, she should have been shaken from her position and lain shattered and broken at our feet.

Tkachuk scored his 22nd goal 6:17 into the game when he redirected in Brad Winchester's pass.
Strickland, 69, suffers from limited imagination and political timidity; at times, he seems almost shellshocked by the loss of 400,000 jobs on his watch. He told The Toledo Blade last week that his administration should have moved faster to prevent Ohio businesses from fleeing to other states. He has consistently mistaken talk for action, produced budgets held together with bubble gum and twine and allowed his team to adopt a siege mentality. He stumbled badly on gambling, treated Ohio's cities as stepchildren and, in a shameful kowtow to his union allies, waged war on effective charter schools.

Aren't injuries part of the game? -- David, Fort Lauderdale.

SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Final notes and observations from the Cavs' 116-102 loss to the San Antonio Spurs Saturday night at AT&T Center:
If the final two weeks and seven games of the season, starting with tomorrow night’s match at Minnesota and followed by Wednesday night’s game at Winnipeg are as much about preparing for the playoffs as they are about retaining the conference lead, it is imperative that Dubinsky is put in a position to succeed while also being allowed to fail.

Bottom line: The issue may come down to what one veteran pollster called "sequencing" -- where voters want the government to demonstrate that it's serious about reducing illegal immigration before legalizing 12 million people.

Tired of people? Try peacocks and cycads instead. At the 127-acre L.A. County Arboretum & Botanic Garden (301 N. Baldwin Ave., Arcadia), you can do that, inspect reflections on Baldwin Lake and read up on the life, times and wives of local pioneer Lucky Baldwin, whose land this once was.

Her retelling of the scandalous Iran-Contra saga is especially good -- almost like a breezy spy novel.

Optimism for Rio's future also is causing some headaches. Land prices have tripled in some areas since 2005 as developers flush from some $19 billion in recent public stock offerings compete to buy project sites.

Smith persuaded the board to count on Congress for a $10 billion package to save teaching jobs nationwide; it's expected to provide $6 million to hang onto teachers in Portland.

That was the premise of the society. It developed vignettes of civil rights figures such as John Berry Meachum, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, John Brown and others. But, in recent years, cultural diversity has become less of a priority, competing for class time with the academic imperatives that appear on statewide tests. Teaching tolerance has become extracurricular.
In the final minutes of Game 5, the Blues came of age.
But this is no abstruse essay film. "Cabin" is a fiendishly funny thriller. It's chockablock with character humor. Sweet, hatchet-faced Kranz and a couple of sublimely cast co-stars we won't mention are in a three-way tug of war to steal the show, and Hemsworth uses his heroic authority to unexpected comic effect.

Jim McIntyre, a former Multnomah County prosecutor who now works as a criminal defense attorney, said investigators are acting responsibly in keeping close tabs on information. "Their obligation is to objectively investigate the case," he said. "What if it's not her and what if it's someone else?" Focusing solely on one person as a potential suspect could lead investigators to miss the true culprit.

I bravely sat in a comfortable chair and watched the JJ Abrams version of "Star Trek" and the Neil Gaiman-penned episode of "Doctor Who" in HD, back to back, just to see what would happen.
James Starks, RB, Packers at Panthers. Ryan Grant still has seniority, but there's little doubt Starks is the superior runner. Look for the bruiser to keep staking his claim to the starting role against a soft Carolina run defense that just lost its best player (MLB Jon Beason) for the season.

To do so, the document outlines a three-point action plan: expand the supply of bike racks, establish a system of sharing the road and educate the public through outreach programs.
Saturday marked the first time the national event had been held in Oregon, said Brink, the former national association president. Until about five years ago, the national championship always was in Colorado, in part because that's where the best rafting teams in the nation are and in part because that's the way things had always been done, said Brink, 42, of Sandy, who is the head football coach at Milwaukie High School. He's also the Oregon Rafting Team founder.
My wonderful daughter Lisa, a "Flag Girl," and I attended the Saturday races. Because of The Sun's reporting, I was prepared for a Ravens-style traffic jam, but there wasn't one. In fact, the streets were almost empty, to the point that I was wondering if the race had been canceled.

When detectives moved in, a woman at the Phoenix home was found hiding the girl in a bathroom under a pile of clothes and towels, according to Phoenix police. The couple believed to be holding Amber claimed they adopted her, though investigators said they had no documentation to prove it.
Robinson and Liszt also are typical in that they resumed their full activities once they healed. The notion that a repaired knee has to be babied for the rest of one's life is long gone, doctors said. On the contrary; factor in the lack of pain that was restricting movement before, and the activity level increases for most people.
Authorities said that Adrienne Martin's death Dec. 19 in Busch's mansion in Huntleigh was an accident, and that a hole in Martin's nasal septum indicated 'several months to a year of cocaine use."

Ultimately, however, the best solution is a change in sexual mores. Timberg and Halperin cite the case of Uganda, where the biggest inroads against the disease were made in the 1980s and 1990s. They attribute the success to the efforts of dictator Yoweri Museveni, who initiated the "Stop Grazing" program when it became clear that many of his top soldiers were infected. Stop grazing meant limiting sex outside of marriage or other stable relationships, and the campaign emphasized the lethal consequences from such encounters. "Fear works," one African official noted. The highly public deaths of popular singers Franco, Fela Kuti and Philly Lutaaya from the disease reinforced that fear, and HIV transmission rates in Uganda fell markedly — at least until the fear wore off. Whether similar results can be obtained elsewhere remains highly questionable
That's true of Stark, who is also Iron Man, most of all. But circumstances demand cooperation. Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the adopted and exceptionally bitter brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), has cooked up a scheme that involves enslaving Earth that involves the Tesseract, an otherworldly source of evidently limitless power. Understanding exactly how this works is, thankfully, not a requirement of enjoying the movie. You just need to know that it's a bad thing.
“I think people like to contribute (donations) here because they see the shop is so pretty and it’s such a nice place,” said Shaker Heights resident Dorothy Sawyer, who has volunteered for the Discovery Shop since its 1984 inception. “I like seeing other people get real pretty things.”

"I don't think it's possible to underestimate the impact Natalie has had on the way that female golfers feel good about themselves and their own athleticism," he suggested. "The girls I coach all want to wear short skirts. When I ask if they wouldn't rather wear something comfortable, they say no. Fashion has become increasingly fashionable, for both males and females. Just look at Tiger Woods."

St. Louis-based Ameren is "extremely disappointed" by the order and is considering its legal options, spokeswoman Rita Holmes-Bobo said.
Those concepts don't exist in the bill before the Senate. While Scott said that was somewhat disappointing, she would be happy with the passage of a bill that would take an incremental step toward shared custody. The percentages in law are just starting points for negotiations. But Scott said she felt 25 percent is too low, and encourages parents to fight too much in divorce proceedings to claim the remaining time with their children. A presumption of shared custody, she argued, would compel more constructive negotiations.
District 3's boundaries run roughly from the Scottsdale line to I-17, and from Bell south to Dunlap Road.

Not that we needed any more evidence, but it seems more and more certain that Lombardozzi, an Atholton High alum, will head north with the Nationals. Johnson echoed general manager Mike Rizzo's sentiments from Friday, that the Nationals are still making their final decision. But with no other infielders behind Espinosa and Desmond, the Nationals appear ready to bet Johnson will get Lombardozzi enough at-bats to make his time in the majors worthwhile.

"I tell people we're a space-rock band," DiFranco said. "We get labeled as stoner rock, but I don't see it. We're more ambient. We have way more melody, we actually have hooks in our choruses, and there's no screaming. It's all singing."
If workers are accused of breaking the rules, they are given a written copy of the charges and allowed to defend themselves at a hearing that functions like a trial, BNSF said in a written statement. Most workers are represented by a union official, and a BNSF manager presides over the hearing. The railroad has the burden of proving its allegations and workers can appeal any decision on discipline to a neutral arbitrator.

In one conversation with a government informant about a pending deal, Chiesi is quoted as saying: "I'm dead if this leaks. I really am ... and my career is over. I'll be like Martha (expletive) Stewart."
Service is a kettle of fish at the new Lobster Pot. One evening we had a pro, a gentleman who has spent years zipping around this particular dining room (according to Vincent, half the servers were retained from the old Lobster Pot). This waiter could kibbitz and advise while keeping a close eye on his full section. Another night, we drew the short straw with a waiter on his first night on the job. The computer, the pacing and the myriad details of fine dining service flummoxed him, his section containing far too many tables for a newbie. By evening's end he had an unmistakably defeated look — lucky for him the gratuity was not discretionary.
At Carlitos Gardel, of course you should indulge. The normal cautions and rules don't apply at this restaurant outside of time and place. Let Gardel's music and mother Bozoghlian's honest cooking work its magic. Here, it's Buenos Aires sometime in the past and all is well —- Mr. Bozoghlian in the back, glasses pushed down on his nose, adding up the bills, his son Max decanting a wine, Gerard giving a short history of the restaurant to newcomers as laughter and the scent of garlic and grilled beef wafts over the quaint dining room.

"This was the right thing to do," Dipoto said, declining to say how the move might impact his ability to maneuver at the trade deadline. "It's not comfortable. It's not comfortable for Arte. It's not comfortable for the organization. That's a lot of money."
Still, analysts haven't hesitated to try to fill the void. The wide variance in their numbers comes in large part from the different methods they use to estimate sales. Forrester, for instance, monitors the credit-card statements of a few thousand people who have volunteered to be part of its research panels, while Piper Jaffray tries to extrapolate from the few stats Apple drips out from time to time.
Investors appeared to be more concerned about Europe after the German government played down hopes that a solution to the debt crisis was imminent. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 200 points in mid-afternoon trading. Broader indexes also declined.

“They’ve been very grounded, and for us, the most important thing is we’ve got a league game coming in on Saturday,” he said. “If that league game means 6-0, that’s great, but it means 2-0 in the ECAC, and that’s the most important number we’re going to look at. Every time you win, that’s a good thing, but right now, we’re trying to keep our heads down and not worry about what our opponents are doing, but worry more about what we can control, and that’s our effort on Saturday.”

Meet the new Subaru BRZ: 200 horsepower, 2,800 pounds, 2+2 seating, six-speed manual gearbox (an automatic is also available) and rear-wheel drive. Figure about $25,000 to start. A joint project between Subaru and Toyota (which will sell the car in the U.S. as the Scion FR-S), the BRZ is a handful of sports-coupe sunshine that does something brilliant, even revolutionary: It feels fast, even though it isn't, particularly.
Celebrity Scientologists include John Travolta and Kelly Preston, Priscilla and Lisa Marie Presley, and of course Tom Cruise. There have been other stars who have reportedly left the religion, including Cruise’s former wife, Nicole Kidman, but none have done so in as vocal a manner as Haggis.

Helm was persuaded to rejoin the group, and soon he and the rest of the Hawks were signed by Capitol Records, the home of the Beatles. Helm only half-jokingly suggested the quintet name itself racial epithets aimed at Caucasians because, according to his autobiography, it was playing the music of poor Southern white folks.
Superintendent Tim Mills has said as many as three of the district's 32 schools could be shut down, and one closure could lead to about $530,000 in savings.

But the clashes they helped spark last year had also served to inject new life into the protests as demonstrators took up the issue of police brutality following running clashes in Oakland and pepper spray incidents elsewhere in the country.
These ups and downs are not particularly unusual for a young quarterback, by the way. After throwing three interceptions against the Bills last week, he seemed hesitant Sunday to throw the ball into small windows. His more devoted followers will no doubt blame the play-calling, but he threw the ball 22 times and completed only six. That's poor, by any measure.
The seeds - which resemble poppy seeds - have become an especially popular addition to drinks. That's because when soaked in water, the seeds develop a gelatinous coating, giving them the texture of tapioca. Add them to a drink and the result is similar to Japanese bubble tea - a thick beverage full of floating, jelly-like balls.
The movie highlights the success of several charter schools, including Harlem Children’s Zone and Knowledge is Power Program, or KIPP.

Finally, the documentary says the Round-Up also is notable for another, increasingly rare trait: Interviews with Round-Up veterans explain that the event has a history of being reluctant to embrace corporate sponsorships, out of concern it would become too commercialized.
Pending regulation and lawsuits sent some companies down more than the overall market. Lorillard Inc. dropped 7 percent, the most of any company in the S&P 500 index. Investors are concerned that the Food and Drug Administration could ban menthol cigarettes. The company makes the most popular menthol cigarette on the market, Newport. Oilfield services company Halliburton fell nearly 5 percent after the Supreme Court ruled shareholders can pursue a class-action lawsuit that claimed that company inflated its stock price.

For a holiday gathering (or any time), the new RingSide Fish House (Fox Tower, 838 S.W. Park Ave.; 503-227-3900) offers a great venue. Branching out from its historic Portland custom of providing the "best steaks in town" and celebrating Oregon's proximity to fresh fish and seafood, the new RingSide is a promising newcomer. You'll find a raw bar, seafood platters, sandwiches (including nonseafood) and changing entrees of halibut, cioppino, lobster, trout and many other fish choices with a sprinkling of beef, pasta and poultry. Lunch, Monday through Friday; dinner, daily.

It would seem impossible Gomez could be cleared to return prior to a training camp physical, thus further complicating both the future of the center — whose career has spiraled into disrepute and who likely would have been better off being cut loose into free agency — and the decisions confronting the incoming administration of the currently Headless Habs.
"The wait yesterday was a little frustrating, but at the same (time) it humbled me and it allowed me to really sink in why I'm actually playing this game," Worthy said during a teleconference.

Back in the day, friends would entice us out to the beach with an invitation to cruise the "Miracle Mile." It's a stretch of beach behind a row of St. Pete Beach hotel and motel bars that's really more like 0.8 of a mile. But the allure is the ability to wend your way down the beach on a wonderfully radiant day, imbibing and relaxing – sometimes taking advantage of the refreshing pool -- until you reach the end and can call a friend or a cab to ferry you home. It'd been a while since we did the Mile, so we took a trip out to the beach recently to see how the bars were doing. Here's our report.
Mr. Ryan stands to become chairman of the House Budget Committee, and is regarded within his party as an expert on budget and spending issues. He praised multiple parts of the proposal but said he couldn't back it over concerns related to future health care costs.
What is critical to understand is that The Florida Bar is motivated only by greed - not the best interests of the child or even those of the divorcing parents. In crafting and opposing legislation, the bar's goal is simple: Write family law to maximize judicial discretion in order to maximize litigation. The bar wants to maximize litigation so that divorce lawyers can charge $400 to $900 an hour to pick the last remaining dollars off the bones of the formerly intact family.

The production is fleshed out with stock, mid-century baseball film footage and documentary-style interviews that advance and comment on the action. And there are more contemporary echoes as well: third-baseman Edmund coveting his brother Edgar's short stop job sounds like a reference to the Yankees' Alex Rodriguez and Derek Jeter.
