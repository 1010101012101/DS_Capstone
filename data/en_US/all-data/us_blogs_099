Perhaps we could market donating to charity as a medicine? It’s more believable than the real suggestions and it would probably have a much better effect on the person donating, not to mention the society we’re trying to champion.

Now to the main event!! I initially went there for something called Lacto-fermenting. It is a beautiful process of preserving fresh vegetables and bringing about the natural probiotics through this specific fermentation process. The same beneficial bacteria that are in yogurt can be made to be in our fresh vegetables. Things like Kim-Chi and Saur Kraut. are great examples. And this process is how we can do it simply in our own homes.
And don’t get me started on my eyesight. I know I wear glasses so have problems anyway... but bloody hell. Subtitles need to be big print. Any kind of electronic text on the telly – Ceefax (does that still exist?), digibox menus, etc – seems to blur and morph like the word verification most of you guys use on your blogs. And don’t get me started on the back of DVD boxes. Most of the time all I want to find is the running time before I choose to watch something (‘cos I like to be curled up bed with a large print book by 9.30) but (a) I can never find it and (b) when someone points out its location the print is too small for me to read. Too small! And bringing the box closer to my eyes only makes it worse! I’m supposed to be short-sighted, for Heaven’s sake!

In a study of divorcing couples published last year in the Family Court Review, the results showed that about 30% of individuals who were divorcing said they would seriously consider a reconciliation service if it was offered by the court. Additional research that matched spouses’ responses found that in about 10% of couples both partners were open to reconciliation.

You are an unwilling visitor to a country whose language you do not speak. You know very little about the place and don’t know if the part you are stuck in is characteristic of the country as a whole. You might be on an island the size of Bali or in a country the size of Siberia. Via and interpreter you are told that the only way out is to hire a car, but before you can do that, you have to pass a written test which shows you know the local road rules.

At this point, Diary, I needed a little down time! So even though the food at Resurrection is very good, I decided to walk up the street to Grace Tavern, which I have come to believe has one of the very best burgers in the city, and had one of those burgers for lunch, and it was yummy! I also had a tastily tart glass of Petrus Aged Pale Ale, and a great conversation with Philly Brewing man-about-town Chris Morris, who gifted me with a newly-bottled Fleur de Lehigh, one of my favorite spring beers. When I suddenly realized it was almost 1:45, I paid up, and ran for the Jetta: I had another date with Mister Pliny the Younger!

A related set of studies published by Keltner and his colleagues last year looked at how social class influences feelings of compassion towards people who are suffering. In one study, they found that less affluent individuals are more likely to report feeling compassion towards others on a regular basis. For example, they are more likely to agree with statements such as, “I often notice people who need help,” and “It’s important to take care of people who are vulnerable.” This was true even after controlling for other factors that we know affect compassionate feelings, such as gender, ethnicity, and spiritual beliefs.
Under the new law citizens would be allowed to carry their weapons into churches, schools and sports arenas — places they currently aren’t allowed to be packing heat.

I’ve been chuckling to myself lately when I’m walking around thrift stores, because I’ve been seeing all sorts of pinterest projects gone wrong. Summer is approaching here in Oregon and people are slowly but surely cleaning out their nooks and crannies. This includes dumping their failed craft projects as fast as possible. So I thought to myself, “I should start a Pinterest Fail section of my blog”. I thought it was a genius idea. I googled it when I got home and found it already exists. But I’m going to do it anyway…cause I thought of it too.

So don't worry about buying new furniture. You can buy that when you're 45 and the kids are older and won't wreck it anyway. Don't worry about new cars. Don't worry about big TVs. Save some money. And teach your kids to save some money while they're young. Don't let them waste their 20s, even if they're not married yet. They need that time, and we're all going to have to learn to be a nation of savers, because the safety net is going to be awfully small by the time we need it.

I think self-publishing’s big downside is that it provides writers the means to just jump in before they’re seasoned. And it’s not as simple as that the manuscript isn’t ready, or the cover isn’t good, or whatever (though those things really aren’t simple at all). It’s about understanding oneself as an artist and a businessperson, and knowing where and how to fit in. And that understanding comes slowly…even while self-publishing makes publishing and distribution into things that can happen easily and fast.

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools ...Many of my online friends and colleagues have seen their words used as excuses for a vile act they would never have imagined let alone condoned. There was no ambiguity in their words that lent them to such usage. The problems in Norway are real. The solution devised by Breivik was diabolical. It has no grounds in the works of the authors he cites. Indeed, many of the authors, in their comments section, have continually told the “let’s nuke ‘em” crowd to get lost. They were never welcomed in the halls of reasonable debate.

“I Like My Country Music Kinda Rock”, another Vern co-write, is a bit disingenuous, since I’ve seen little evidence that Vern ever had much rock in his soul.

I told him that we could do better than that...we could make actual Alien Masks!!! This wasn't a craft project I planned. I just happened to remember that we had some things on hand that would work for alien masks. This is one of the reasons I like to have lots of generic craft supplies on hand. Sometimes they make for very enjoyable impromptu projects like this. And things always feel so much more natural when they are child-led and driven. As opposed to some huge, planed out thing that I try to get the child excited about doing.

In order to try and maintain some momentum and reinvigorate my motivation I decided to take a more methodical approach. I always find that when I am lagging and losing interest in things if I alter the means by which I am tackling the task I become more involved in it and more capable of completing them. So, I decided to chart my character’s thoughts and feelings throughout their life in a table. Yes, it sounds ultimately dull and unimaginative, however it is enabling me to properly understand my character’s motivations and interpretations of events within the novel.

I thought I would share my project with you here on my own blog as well. I created an altered project to use as the example for the challenge. I altered a vintage muffin tin that I found at a local thrift store for a whopping 49 cents! You can't beat that! After bringing the tin home and cleaning it up, I almost put a fresh coat of paint on it. But then I saw all the age that the tin had aquired over years of loving use and I decided to leave it as is. I thought it would look more vintage that way. I then used varoius scrapbooking embellishments, as well as a gorgeous tag from Berry Bleu, to alter the tin up. I will be hanging this tin on my door for the month of February.
What's the solution? End excise taxes. Stop taxing targetted industries. If you don't think people should smoke, make it illegal (and good luck to you if it's just one state at a time). Don't try to balance the do-gooder "raise taxes so people stop smoking" with the darkly cynical "raise taxes and hope they don't stop smoking so much that we lose revenue." Do away with all these ridiculous taxes and fees and charges and nickel-dime bullshit. Tax income and property, things everyone has to pay (you can be progressive about it, I'm not touting a flat tax) and no one can avoid by smuggling their home into another state.

I don’t think this debate is about religious freedom. I think the church leaders would like to think so. But if it were about religion we would have policy to eradicate poverty which is mentioned in the Bible 2,000 times. So it’s not about religion. What it is about is the high cost of insurance for women of childbearing age to which I say “Too damn bad.” I say that because the same group of folks who bash “socialist” health care want to leave women hanging by not assisting with her health care needs. Companies which basically own people. They tell them when to wake up, when to eat, when to sleep, when to go to the bathroom, when to take a vacation. So they own them. Even slave owners of the past realized that they have to provide slaves with basic health care. Didn’t these folks get the memo? With all the money dolled out on studies for employee retention and satisfaction and none of those brainiacs can figure out that people need to have their family needs met to be productive employees? The company should get its consulting money back and apply it to the needs of its employees. And why wouldn’t they want their female employees on birth control? If they are on birth control, they are at work. The whole thing is ridiculous!
I tuned it all out. My interest in Whitney Houston had less to do with her music or career and more to do with a specific moment in time.

That day lingers in my memory as one of the most beautiful days that I ever shared with my sister, and in such a mystical place.

I sometimes feel that I was meant to be a nun, but my life was too cluttered by the time I realized it.

The Corvette finally ran for shelter in my mother's garage (thanks mom!!!), the Electra is booked in for rust proofing next week and the storage. The Lincoln has a somewhat quieter exhaust, still needs more work, new alternator and may yet require a tune up in the form of plugs, wires, cap and rotor. Nevertheless she is moving on her own now.
I stamped the Sentiment using Versamark and embossed using gold embossing powder, I also used gold embossing powder on the charm as I only had silver hearts in my stash!

The last time I went to Krue Se mosque was almost two years ago. The muezzin still called out, and the prayers continued as usual. One local pointed to me the pockmarked holes left by bullets on its wood and brick walls. The way he did that told me there were other scars lodged in his chest, for the most brutal wounds are always the invisible ones. Like Barcelona’s Sagrada Familia cathedral, the Krue Se mosque of Pattani is perpetually unfinished, perched between accidental minimalism and sad uncertainty. It stands as a forlorn testament to the doubt and broken peace that have plagued the restive region, especially of late. Actually, a spate of violence killing soldiers and civilians greeted the 8th anniversary of the Krue Se incident last week before the PM’s visit.
I used to review everything apart from mm stories, even though the green fd stuff really wasnt my scene, even if ironically thats just what I’m working on at present. Recently due to work commitments and the like, I’ve cut the green stories pretty much out, though there are a few writers on that front I will still read. Same with the mm stuff, I do read a very occasional one, but you could count them on the fingers of one hand lol!

Here are ten things I love/am looking forward to this month:
Step 4: Put sparkly fruit out to dry. I had some toruble with the fruit sticking to the newspaper. In the future I would put down some wax paper to dry the fruit.
Next run is supposedly tomorrow, and is another 3 miler. However i have pretty intense arch pain in my right foot, so if that’s not good by tomorrow then the whole distance from mile 1 will be intervalled. Instead of running a full mile before intervalling.
In spite of growing up poor on a farm so far out in the middle of nowhere that the road was given his family name for lack of anything else out there to name it after, and having to leave school in the middle of seventh grade to get a job, Dad managed to get his degree in horticulture, move to Canada, learn to speak English fluently, and start his own greenhouse business, becoming a respected grower in his field. After 35 years the business has ceased to be profitable and my parents are in the process of shutting it down and preparing to retire; but its ending has nothing to do with any failure on his part, and everything to do with changes in the local and global economy, absurd government environmental policies, and skyrocketing fuel costs. He and my mom have been married almost forty years, have five healthy and reasonably successful children, and a big comfortable house on a small acreage they’ve farmed and gardened into a home; yet Dad feels like a failure most of the time. Raised Lutheran, he converted to Catholicism briefly in my early teens and fell away a few years later; currently, I think he has a vague belief in Christ tempered with occasional animosity toward Catholicism. His innate pessimism became depression years ago, and he cries easily at moving stories on television or in the paper – a problem that worsened recently, another sign of Parkinson’s.
I just wanted to share some of the scenery…

10) I got a new camera for Christmas and have been taking lots of pictures. But I forget to get the card reader out of the disaster room before Micah goes in there to take a nap every day. By the time he wakes up, I've forgotten about uploading pictures. I'm starting to feel a great deal of guilt about this.
Okay so starting today I am going to start working on this puzzle. I'm going to follow the same system as the couple.......except i'm starting with a 500 piece. $5 X 500= $2500. In the past puzzles were my Mother's key to keeping her sanity during snow days. Ha! My sister has always been able to sit for hours and work puzzles. Me on the other hand......I just don't have the patience. At least not the amount needed to sit and work 500, 1000 or 2000 piece puzzles in one sitting. I just don't and I probably never will. That being said I think this will work out better. Each paycheck I am planning to save as much as possible for the puzzle project. It's going to take a while to finish but that way I won't lose interest in it.
This film put me in such a relaxed, benevolent, generously warm mood, I’d imagine my friends would prescribe this for me to watch on a regular basis. This is a gentle, slow-paced gem of a movie. Director Agnes Jaoui, regular writing collaborator with her husband and co-star Jean-Pierre Bacri, has created a film with warm, believable characters that you feel sure existed before the cameras were switched on, and will carry on long after they stop. They are real to us – it’s not so much a matter of suspending disbelief and entering their film world, it’s more that it almost comes as a bit of a shock to remember they’re actors. When I found out that Bacri, who plays the financially-sound but emotionally void Castella is actually married in real life to the drug-dealing waitress of the local cafe, it came as a shock, and not because of their ages, but because of their characters. So deeply do they inhabit this world, you are left to sit and follow the waves of plot that are condensed, sure, but come across as far more natural and believable than in most films you could see, certainly from somewhere like Hollywood. We linger on shots for longer, our characters pause, they reflect, life goes on around them.
This conference just occurred last week - thus my excuse for the lack of posting in recent months.
A little further down the road Goodman stopped me for Rhino tracks, I waited while he examined the tracks and then got a call to come look. On closer examination we decided they were very fresh as we found a spot where he had scraped and urine sprayed, the ground and surrounding grass still being wet. As Goodman is still new to the area he does not know the roads so he can't go tracking by himself yet but I could see he was dying to put his abilities to work so I agreed to join him. We knew we had to be fast as we had guests sitting on the vehicle waiting and the fact the Rhino was travelling and not feeding and they can cover a fair distance in a very short amount of time. We again found where he had urine sprayed, this time on top of a Mopane shrub, it indicated we were very close as the urine was still milky white and had not even run off the leaves. Quickening our pace we found him as he passed through a Terminalia thicket down into a drainage line. We approached closer to try identify the individual but it appeared new to me. We were now faced with a dilemma as the car was now about a kilometre away and the Rhino was still moving away from us. Does Goodman continue to follow while I go back and fetch the car, risking the fact that I may have to then track both of them, or do we both run back to the vehicle and drive around and check the roads he was heading towards hoping luck would be on our side. Not fancying having to track the two of them we both ran back. Returning with the vehicle to an area he was headed we found the spot where he had crossed the road still travelling as opposed to feeding. We once again chose to head off on foot and try relocate him. This time though we had learnt and every two hundred metres I would run back and fetch the vehicle so there would not be so big a space between the two of us should we find him. Goodman went about following his Rhino once again, and would loose the tracks on occasion but would patiently return to his last track and relocate from there. Through his calm and collected approach coupled with his perseverance it was not long before we relocated on him. We ran back for the vehicle and then approached very apprehensively fearing it may be a skittish visitor. When he became aware of us he turned and faced the vehicle, head up and ears forward, we were waiting for him to turn and crash through the bushes but instead he dropped his head to the ground and slowly started to feed as if we were never there. We continued to follow him through some very thick bush in a drainage line and he did not even flinch. He finally stopped on a very well grassed termite mound where he fed on the nutritious grass. It also enabled us to get a better view of him out in the open. I still cannot tell you who he is, what I can tell you though is that it's

And finally, one that's been niggling away since I went to Brittany two years ago and visited the inn where Gauguin and some of his friends stayed for a few months: the Buvette de la Plage. But that one's still on the boil: no, no, it doesn't matter how much you plead, I won't tell you another word. (The picture was taken nearby.)

We then moved on to the "storage area" of Pompeii. Large buildings have been erected to house some of the various items that have been uncovered in the ruins. Most of the "really cool shit" (as our guide put it) was in the museum in Naples, but we got to see hundreds and hundreds of clay jars and jugs. And if that's not cool, then what is? I was amazed at the amount of pottery that survived completely intact. I break a dish or a wine glass once a week. This is some sturdy-ass stuff.

Of course, that outcome is a direct result of other CEOs like him, who were determined to stay here and utilize Michigan’s talent pool. Now those businesses are there to service each other. When the talent is here, so then follows economic vitality. We even surprise ourselves sometimes, which is another charming theme stitched into the fabric of our Michigander DNA. The talent, the brains and the willpower of the people who live in Michigan is so unassuming – so very Midwestern – that it’s easy to overlook, whether you’re flying by with a camera or driving down I-75. But it is here. We’re here. We haven’t stopped working just because everyone stopped paying attention, and we’ll likely keep our heads down and nose to the grindstone when the world starts to take notice of how far we’ve come. That’s just how we do things here.
Yet the old SA police were accused of being brutal and inhumane, while no one has ever said a single word about what has been happening since the ANC took control of South Africa?
My next card for this post is also one I have been wanting to make since I saw the sentiment. It is very simply stamped & colored and a little cuttlebug embossing, not alot of bells and whistles to take away from the sentiment. (Beware: my coloring is very amateur - sorry!)
Once away from our desks, there is much more of a temptation to reach out and talk to a fellow employee. It feels somehow peculiar to pretend the neighbor you’ve been ignoring for five hours straight doesn’t deserve at least a nod of the head when you pass them in the hall. But unless your brain rattles loose inside your skull, this still makes for a silent encounter.
To put this together I used straight wire that I attached to the back of the designs using Glossy Accents and then adhered the extra pieces I cut for the backing. I then placed them inside my painted coffee can. None of my ribbons matched well, I ran out of paper so I couldn't make more of the sucker flowers and because of the change in plans I didn't have something to use for filler to cover the floral foam. It is a good thing Julie's Birthday is the 30th.

I know that Jo + Prof. Bhaer and Amy + Laurie get most of the attention (and they are stunning love stories in their own right, trust me!), but I love Meg + John Brooke. It's so quiet, so gentle. It's so real. Amy's love story is a fairy tale, and Jo's is a bit unconventional -- both of which suit their respective heroines. But Meg? It's a gradual thing, that just creeps in and is fully in place before you realize what's happening. Simple and beautiful and sweet.

The idea is essentially docu-fiction, following the life of a casting director as he goes about his duties while waiting to have a first meeting with the woman who is to be the love of his life. It deals with themes of love and identity, as well as nostalgia and memory and is heavily and deliberately inspired by the films and directors of the French New Wave, specifically Jean-Luc Godard.
They attack him and he fights them off really well for an old coot, and then he even turns back to his younger immortal self, because the two goons messed with the time stream or something. Now, this begs the question…if they can just go anywhere in time, why not just go back to when they first put him on Earth and cut his head off before he awakened his powers that first time? Or why not just go back to when they had him enslaved at first and kill him while he was bound in chains? Oh, wait, because then we wouldn’t have a movie. Silly me!

Passing a bird house that had gone unnoticed when I first moved here in the summer of 2010, I stopped again to admire the peeling paint of what must have been a rather colorful little dwelling once upon a time. I thought about Otis, the man who cared for this place so lovingly, noted the date he'd painted on the back of the birdhouse, and renewed my own commitment to the land.

One of my first assignments as a newbie at 13.tv was to create an inspirational art piece on the beauty of suffering. Some of the first things that came to mind were images of a glassblower with his glass, or a potter with his/her clay – an idea that became the centre of our video. Thursday night Flaps made use of our video clip as an introduction to his #Reverb session, with the clip serving as an idea booster. We had to think about the potter and the clay, about ourselves as the clay with God as the Potter, and then write down ten statements. It was both a humbling and an inspiring process to look at and talk about each other’s statements – serving as a reminder of who we are, Who we belong to, and what our lives are meant to be. And so I decided to share my ten statements with you…maybe it can be the reminder you need…or maybe this is the good news you have yet to hear…

But make no mistake: Obama has shown himself to have the temperament, the vision, the organizational ability, a great ability to spot and attract talent, and the leadership skills to be someone who can make sense out of the mess we’re in and at least point the country in the direction out of the morass. It’s not about what he’s “accomplished” with respect to governmental legislation. All you have to do is look at what he accomplished and the way that he did so with his assault on the presidency, with all the odds stacked against him, to know that he has more than a fighting chance to see his way through.
I was here for a good half hour, noting the comings and goings of the staff and also that it was soon near empty with only me in.

Just as we see the masses around the world turning their backs on parliaments and the bankruptcy of social democracy, mobilising on the streets and Liberation squares to take their futures into their own hands, young people and workers are doing the same in Aotearoa. When it is clear that parliament is talk shop for the bosses and the state the committee to manage the affairs of the ruling class, the people are waking up to the reality that they have the power to make change by uniting, organising and campaigning for what they need.
Afterward we walked to the Ben Thanh Market to look for some souvenirs as we are always the tourists. The market was filled with fruit, vegetables, meat, clothing, and, of course, the usual souvenir trinkets. It was a huge market, and we could only stay for a short while before the shop keepers got to be too much. Steve said that this market was not any different than any of the other markets we have been to—too much stuff and most it is made in China.
I can't even begin to express into words on this blog how hard this has been. Not only on me, but my sweet Dad who loves her so much and doesn't know how to make it without her.

We are all in a world of hurt even still.

Mens suits have undergone marvelous revolution. There are lots of ways today to dress using suits. Commonly suit consists of a pair of trousers with a polite shirt, a belt, a tie, waistcoat and an upper coat. But then each of these above mentioned items come in varieties. For example, you have various designs of shirts which also come in variety of colors, a belt can be worn around the waist area or it can be worn as suspenders along the shoulders.
In the United States, ADHD has become so common that many people think the condition is being overdiagnosed. Medical experts disagree. They say that because scientists have learned a lot about ADHD in recent years, doctors are now better able to identify it. While some cases may be misdiagnosed, many cases actually go undiagnosed. People who have ADD - without the hyperactivity - often go unnoticed because they are quietly daydreaming in the classroom.

that’s a good place to go in my mind when I’m troubled. The problem with cities is that people don’t learn what really matters. Don’t really feel or know the rhythms of the earth. When we are separated from that vital center place, we grow lost. Sadly, most people will never know what they are lost from, or where they can be found.~

Or how many times I had to get tyres changed and fixed on my first car because they went flat thanks to something getting stuck in them from going to football field parking lots in the dark to have sex in the car (seriously if my dad didn’t figure out what had been going on seeing as they all happened the days after I had been to see someone then I’d question his intelligence).
Next morning the daylight was green, underwater lighting throughout the room. Mummy was asleep. I got up and opened the door and saw that the lamps were on in all the rooms although it was morning and the green light came through the snow which covered the windows all the way up. Now it had happened. The house was a single enormous snowdrift, and the surface of the ground was somewhere high up above the roof. Soon the trees would creep down into the snow until only their tops stuck out, and then the tops would disappear too and everything would level itself off and be flat. I could see it, I knew. Not even praying would stop it.

Rhiannon has been sick a lot in the last 2 years. The last year she has been sick more than she's been well. She's well for a week or two and then she is sick again for 2 or 3 weeks. She's missed two dance performances and several lessons and play dates. I started to wonder if she had allergies. Eryn was tested when she was 3 and is allergic to wheat, milk, dust mites and the kind of mould that comes from decaying leaves. I am pretty sure I am also allergic to milk although I have never been tested. Dean has severe seasonal allergies. Although she did not have his kind of symptoms, I started to wonder if there was something going on for her. We went to the Doctor back in January and got a referral to an allergist.
Happy Halloween friends! I know there's some controversy surrounding this holiday but whatever you decide that's best for your family...I hope you have a sugar-high time! :-)
Since Wisconsin also used to be (and still is, given how vigorously unions fought Scott Walker) one of the bastions of the progressive movement, I can see why their state motto might get tarred by the communo-fascist brush.

Julie Andrews (yes, the singer-actor of "The Sound of Music" and "Mary Poppins" fame) Edwards wrote a gripping story that made me keep turning the pages, all 96 pages of it. Although I ran across this book online a year and a half ago (see my blog post), my library didn't have a copy. When I saw it on sale yesterday, I bought it. Because I couldn't put it down, I rate it 10 of 10, my highest rating.
Why the change and things for you to consider
The worst part is that I feel like I’ve abandoned my wife. I don’t feel like I’m here for her and I can tell she really needs me now. I feel like a failure as a husband. Failing to connect with the outside world is bad enough. Failing to connect with her is excruciating.

Ahhhh....we think she was looking for the Carmex.
In endorsing a diplomatic process that ignores Israel, the U.N. would, in effect, affirm the Arab world's attempt to erase Israel's legitimacy. And by encouraging Israeli despair, it could help turn Palestine into a permanent virtual state.

On a day when a few of the kids decided to try and hook me up with all of my male coworkers, little F declared, "You should marry T 'cause he can spit good!" After I stopped laughing hysterically I told F that spitting ability is one of the main things I'm looking for in a mate.
April was a slow month both in sales and blog visits, but I’m still quite happy and excited and thinking of ways to entice fans at Chicon7, LOL! I have to decide if I want to bring cards, postcards or CDrom with my e-books on it… will have to check Zazzle prices and other options… This following Michael Stackpole’s advice on selling direct – but don’t worry, you won’t see me pestering all the fans at the con. I’m still a very shy person who hates to be at the center of the attention. But if in a conversation somebody asks “What do you write?” I can have something handy to show, know what I mean? I will NOT obsess about it (as suggested by SPAL)!
AU: The cover focuses on the romantic aspect of the book, but also does implicate quite strongly that there is a Greek mythological twist to this story. The lightning also goes really well with the book, which becomes apparent when you read it.
It’s amazing how such wonder can be driven by such lies
I remember at the age of 8 or 9, sitting in the shower stall hugging my knees rocking back and forth and wishing that I was dead. but I don’t remember what had occurred to make me feel that way. To this day there is a black spot on my memory, but I do remember wishing that I was dead at the age of 8 or 9.

Somehow I stumbled upon the website of Hollywood trained makeup artist and beauty consultant Huda Kattan, Huda Beauty. She is stunning. And after looking at her work and video tutorials, extremely talented as well. In her videos, she applies makeup to her own face, explaining the process and techniques while she goes, as well as what brushes and products she's using. I swear I've now watched about every single one. And the nice thing is that they are only about 10 minutes long, so it's not a huge time commitment to learn some new makeup skills.

My original plan for dinner was to take our CSA pea shoots and stir fry them with sliced up pork chops from the freezer. But we had Asian flavors last night, so I switched the plan last minute and went with a combo of this recipe and this one. We didn't have enough pea shoots for both pesto and salad, so I used CSA lettuce and carrots for our veg. I also added some thin spaghetti pasta to use up some more of the pesto.
In the meantime, I will try to devise ways to make the wait seem shorter for you. Even if it involves more bathtubs full of mini marshmallows!

When friends respond like that, why indeed? Well to make money wouldn’t go amiss – not that at the moment there's much chance. I love doing it, sounds a bit weak and self indulgent, but its true, I really do. Getting stuck into writing a story is akin to going on holiday to my way of thinking. But in truth, I want others to have a good time, forget about their troubles for a short while and enjoy reading what I write. If I achieve that, then I'll have achieved the greatest thrill from writing.
I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas and take care. I hope to be back before the new year hits.
After about 2 days of soaking and stirring the beans I made sure that they were undisturbed for at least a couple of hours before I took the bean water, so the proteins could settle at the bottom with the beans. Apparently these can ruin the dye. I laddled the water above the beans into buckets. Since we wanted to try small sample skeins and get the same results if we liked them, we used jars for our small skeins, taking enough liquid each time to cover the skein comfortably. I left the skeins soak for 48 hours before taking them out and rinsing them.

Between the middle of that night before the high Priest and Sanhedrin and the forenoon of the next day when Jesus was nailed to his cross, every one of these laws was broken. Our Lord not only was falsely accused, he was then struck and spit upon by members of the court.
And then there’s the “compliments” that come with it. I say compliments in bunny-ears, because I’m finding it really hard to accept that they’re meant in good jest. I get a lot of “pregnancy suits you!” and all I can hear is “you look great being fat!”. I’m not sure if it’s just me or if there are other pregnant ladies who have those 3 words translated into a fat comment. I also don’t understand why I’m being told I’m glowing because neither myself nor my husband can see it. As he so nicely pointed out “I’d say you look tired more than anything”. Thanks love.

We stayed in Tennessee three years and our last two children were born there. During this time the Gattens left and went to another job. ( Don't all geologist seem to move frequently? We certainly did! ) Then the day came when we were again looking for work and Sieg applied for a job in Kaysville, Utah. Guess who else was applying for the same job? Our friend Jay. Jay got the job, and within a few weeks we were hired also. So off to Utah we went. Our new house was just a block from theirs and our friendship continued like we had never been parted. Our kids played together just as before, except now there were four children in each family.

And when they do, it will be a moment of supreme glory, and to use an analogy that cannot at all compare to what you will actually experience, it will be similar to the effect you might experience if you moved instantaneously from the depths of an unlighted coal mine into the brilliant midday sunshine on a tropical beach. And then a stunning and amazing sense of wonder will clear from your minds the last few remnants of the fog of doubt and confusion in which it seems you have been embroiled for so long.
Once others admit this to themselves, you will stop seeing self righteous assholes talk about the 1% or talk about how others are heartless when they themselves are clearly not stretching themselves to the maximum.
I think the clue to all this is in Richard Bandler's character and what he says about NLP. He is provocative. His style is to spring you out of whatever 'box' your thinking is currently limited to. And remember, he calls NLP an 'attitude and methodology', not a set of truths and techniques.

You are HILARIOUS! You make your dad and I laugh every day. And not just the euphoric chuckle of “isn’t our progeny adorable?”, but serious belly laughs. And seriously every day. You’ve been experimenting with your voice a lot lately, getting ready to talk as soon as those vocal chords figure themselves out. Everyone says you’re going to be a blabbermouth when you finally get around to speaking. I suppose this is my comeuppance for talking my own parents’ ears off as a kid. But even so, I can’t wait to hear your little voice. I’ve spent a lot of time imagining it, and the more noises you learn to make, the easier it is to hear the not-so-distant-future you calling out “mommy” and asking for a snack. How fun.
I LOVE butterscotch and think it is a perfect addition to a chocolate chip cookie. This cookie gets a double dose of butterscotch thanks to butterscotch chips AND butterscotch pudding. I accidentally grabbed the small box of pudding (1 oz) instead of the large box (3.4 oz) but the flavor was still there and these cookies were great! I can't wait to try them again with the correct box of pudding!

Dr. Tyson also believes that melancholy teachers are part of the problem in education today. Having a terrible teacher in the classroom is not only the most boring thing for the students, but also limits students interest in the subject for longer than just the school year.

Barton Fink is a writer who has made it big on Broadway, because of his success Hollywood now has that ‘Barton Fink feeling’ and he has been hired by a huge movie company to write a motion picture about a wrestler.

"We believe that carbon-14 production is essentially constant over time," said Hodgins. "So the amount of carbon-14 present in living organisms in the past was similar to the levels in living organisms today. When an animal or plant dies, the amount of carbon-14 in its remains drops at a predictable rate, called the radioactive half-life. The half-life of radiocarbon is 5,730 years."

Once again, we are dealing with ambiguity as to where the actual seat of the kingdom is located.

T: No, I knew pretty much right from the very beginning when I was a kid that I was going to do something with sound and ‘tech’ stuff. Even when I was going to University, I would always look forward to working lights or a sound board for local coffee house gigs or small productions around the campus. Around this time the Vietnam war was going on, and there were a lot of artists that were playing protest type music in the coffee houses. There were many but a couple still exist like the Ice House in Pasadena and the Troubador in Hollywood. I got to see a fair number of bigger name musicians and people just starting out like Jose Feliciano, and Steve Stills. One of the nights, Wally Hieder, a famous recording engineer, came in and recorded a band and I was able to hang out and talk with him, which led to a job driving his truck. I did that for a while, and that was another stepping stone. I never really have gotten any job by application, its all through meeting people and volunteering. Being able to fix and make headphones and cables really really helped also.
You can see I've gotten my leaves stitched almost all the way down the right side. I've been stitching a length of Attic Tea on the leaves, then I work on the middle. Then back to the leaves. That seems to be breaking up the leaves enough that they're not driving me bonkers!

I have had a really long past month, one of my closest friends over the years died for reasons that i will not go into in a public forum, but after the end of a long work week and mentaly preparing my self for his funeral tomorrow i decided to go on a beerster egg hunt. Thankfully i found Conflux at gomers south and a 2 year vintage bottle of Arcadia Ales -Cereal Killer. The latter is getting stashed into my file cabinet of goodies, but one of the two bottles of conflux is being enjoyed as we speak. And i am impressed and totally get the 2 colaborations now. Now i am even more excited to tour deschutes when i am in portland in early October.

Now, I am going to suggest that what is happening now, with the “Occupy Wall Street” movement, and the “economic” unrest in Europe, is a part of the process of “remembering who we are”, and an important transition into a New Economic Reality. The “Occupy” movement is focussing anger at the greed and exploitation of the big Banks and Corporations, and the way in which ordinary people are being pushed into poverty as a small elite get richer and richer. Hunger and hardship increase, due to price control and inflation, while all the while there is enough on the Planet to support all who live here. But, this is the first time that this is being given widespread recognition.

Of course, that’s NOT the lesson to take from this at all. There’s a definite stigma about illness, and we’re trained not to talk about it, ill and well alike. In fact, one of my closest friends was sick for years before telling me about it, and she only told me because I shared my diagnosis with her. I noticed her taking pills and taking sick days and even asked about it all. Even between two close friends, the subject is taboo.
The meat of the book, and its most valuable content, is in these Response sections and subsections. Here you learn not simply that "Does Not Include Every Claim Element" is an argument against anticipation, but exactly what words to use to make that argument. In other words, this is where you find boilerplate.
The past few days I've been experimenting with dancing strictly open embrace (or "open frame" as I think is more accurate). And I mean about as open as you can get, hand under the armpit type thing. There are two reasons for this: first off, the past weekend was particularly warm in the Bay Area and it was a bit more comfortable to refrain from sharing body heat and stickiness. And second, I'm just not very used to it -- haven't much danced this way socially since I was a beginner -- so I thought it would be good practice for me.

In that conversation he started out with "I don't think I love you". After awhile it was "I love you but I'm not happy". Then it was "I love you but I'm scared, no one has ever depended on me, I need to be alone". I know he's not in a good place... I know he loves me. This was COMPLETELY out of the blue. We had just gotten back the day before from an AMAZING camping trip where we both had a fantastic time, laughing much of the time in the middle of nowhere, just us. Had what I consider the best sex of our relationship. The night before this all happened HE was the one saying "I love you" FIRST on the phone (we had had a small disagreement about something and I was being quiet...he kept repeating "I love you" till I said it back). Now he won't even say I love you.
I wonder if you are still met with ridicule and the names of our gods besmirched before you in public. I wonder if you still hesitate as do I, to disagree.

Over 1991-2004 equity fund investor timing decisions reduce fund investor average returns by 1.56% annually. Underperformance due to poor timing is greater in load funds and funds with relatively large risk-adjusted returns. In particular, the magnitude of investor underperformance due to poor timing largely offsets the risk-adjusted alpha gains offered by good-performing funds. Investors in both actively managed funds and index funds exhibit poor investment timing. We demonstrate that our empirical results are consistent with investor return-chasing behavior.

One year, I had just decorated the mantel and tree in the Hearth Room. I must have dropped a little elf hat that came off of a stuffed elf that I usually left in the box of unused decorations. Adam felt the breeze before I said anything, and ran into the Hearth Room. The movie was sitting in the fireplace, on logs like it had been dropped down the chimney. But, Adam also found the little elf hat and about freaked out. I guess it would be scary to think that there was a little man in your home.
As for deleting comments, I see no point, because I like arguing, because it stimulates my brain and gives me a challenge to overcome, or possibly something that might convince me of something new. For the existence of a god or the supernatural, I have yet to be convinced, but I’m always willing to hear what people have to say.
The time came, the phone rang, the technician got a reading on my voice level, the interview got underway. He was lovely, I imbecilic. I mean really imbecilic.

The best part of the night for me (aside from the part where in my head I decide that Chef Ludo himself designed the night's awesome 90s-hip-hop playlist) was my vantage point. Overall, I wasn't thrilled with the space: Lemon Moon is a cafeteria in an office complex, and the ambiance of its bright, spacious dining room just didn't match the excitement of the night. But it has an open kitchen, and from my seat, I could watch as one chef prepped plate after plate, using an empty glass display case as his work station. He was meticulous about every detail, and I watched as Chef Ludo peered intently over his shoulder, hanging on every drop of sauce, making sure each dish was just perfect. In that moment, all the LudoBites fanfare made sense: every item I was served was at the highest level. Chef Ludo and his team took great pains to achieve harmony from a wild array of complex flavors, to make every plate beautiful. A world of mindful effort is behind every bite. He's pulling out all the stops, putting all he has out there. In that moment, I totally got the LudoBitches. There is most definitely something hot about a man who works so hard to ensure that I, that all of us there, feel taken care of (and seriously, the French accent doesn't hurt, either). This meal made me feel taken care of -- how can I dare act too cool for that?

I am less interested in the dates and details, but I find myself thinking of all those generations of country people from neighbouring farms and cottages, who would have posted their precious letters into this humble red postbox. Letters to friends and family. Business mail and bills being paid. Love letters, news of births and deaths. Letters of happy tidings and of the saddest news. Letters of hope and comfort being posted to the soldiers of the two World Wars.

At its core, suicide caused by depression is often a desperate attempt by a mind incapable of thinking clearly to seek relief from loneliness so palpable that it can cause physical pain, despair so deep you can't see any light at the end of the tunnel and emotional exhaustion so overwhelming that you just feel too tired to go on.

Another trope that drives me up the wall? Love triangle insta-romance, which this book has in spades. I'm actually not opposed to love triangles on principle--I think they can be a great way to illustrate internal conflict, and unfortunately it's an uncomfortable experience a lot of people have had--but when you throw in insta-love, two boys who are unspeakably perfect in every way, and also happen to think that the world revolves around a character I despise, it becomes unbearable. The romantic climax of the story was literally the most cheesy scene I have ever read in a YA novel--ever--and that's saying something.
And the journaling, where is the journaling??? Well, no layout without it! But no panic, I had to rack my brains a little and I've found the perfect spot for it. Or rather a hiding spot, lol! Can you spot (sorry, couldn't help it! :)) the bi-color circle on top? I've simply adhered a punched circle under a piece of paper on which the journaling is printed so it'd be possible to pull it out, and voilà! (Btw, the story is about my dd and me trying to find a new balance once my son started school. She was coming to the kitchen and was always offering help to peel onions. And she was perched up on the counter and meticulously, like the best watch maker, was peeling the "cebukla" without shedding a tear...)

The last thing we wish to say is that you can align your daily life with the cycles of the Moon. The Moon controls the ebb and flow of the earth’s tides. Seventy per cent of the human body is water. So how can it not be that the Moon has an influence on the human body? The Moon moves in a cycle of approximately one month. So lets say that you know when the New Moon is going to be. For the three days that the Moon is in its new phase, it is a time to start new projects, instigate things, and so forth, a time for planting seeds for your life for this month. From the time of the New Moon when you plant the seeds, you have until the Full Moon to take care of and tend to the things you have started. When the Moon is full, orient your life so that any project you have, any errand that needs doing, that you will finish it up at this time. From when the Moon is full until it goes once again into its waxing stage, it is a time for reflection, for looking back over what you did and didn’t accomplish. The three days of the Dark of the Moon should be a time of rest, and is not a good time for heavy social activity. It is a time to spend time being with your own self. It is a time to write in your journals and to reflect on your life and your life’s purpose. Putting one’s self on the lunar cycle on a daily basis is a way to get yourself into the natural cycle of the Moon, to put yourself in tune with the tides of Nature, if you will. You also put yourself into a natural cycle of change so that you will not stagnate.

I backed the van into the area in the drive where I unload animals. I fed the two Saddlebacks so they would be distracted in another part of the field and this meant I would be able to open the gates for the pigs to run straight into the pen from the back of the van without any problem. Two of the piglets did as exactly what they were supposed to do and the other saw a gap under the fence and ran straight through it and joined the sheep in the middle of the field. "Oh Fantastic" I cried ... this is just great!!
I can’t imagine the pain and grief that she’s experiencing. She probably feels like she can never show her face in public again. She’s probably questioned everything about her life and her relationship with God in the last few weeks. She was seen as a spiritual leader for women and was sacrificially serving her children by educating them at home, among other things. Honestly, she sounds a lot like my mom and the kind of mom I’d like to be someday. Her husband was seen as a man of character – now their name is linked to a sordid scandal. His name is her name. His shame has become their shame. They’ve had to abandon their home and go into hiding because of the intensity of media coverage after his name was leaked to the press.

A lot of people don’t understand the Penn State mentality and I don’t 100 percent get it either. I’m not a PSU fan. Never have been and never will be. My disgust for Penn State is borderline hate (but my grandmother taught me when I was little to never hate anyone. I bet your nana taught you that too). I think there’s some kind of brainwashing that goes on at freshman orientation, kind of like in the movie “Disturbing Behavior.” I’m kidding of course. Or am I? At the same time that I don’t get it, I do. Penn State is Joe Paterno and football. They go together like bread and butter. He’s been around for almost half of the schools existence (not really, but close) and he’s turned the institution into a huge place, just because of football. To Staters, Joe Pa and football are the be all end all. They can do anything and it’s okay because the football program makes the school a ton of money, wins, and brings national recognition that PSU is a “cool” place to go. I use cool in quotes because have any of you been to State College? It’s not that cool. Without PSU, State College is just another sleepy town in Pennsyltucky. Tucked along 322 and 80. Students, alumni and fan boys hold Paterno and the whole football program to this inappropriately high standard. They’re god-like and all the little blue and white sheeple have this massive ego like they’re allowed to be these snobby, elitist kids because PSU is the most awesome thing ever (You’d think they went to Yale or something). Side note: at the trustee presser, I wanted to punch the student reporters and students in general in the face. The media didn’t bring this problem to Sad Valley. The offenders/cover uppers did. Okay, moving on…Then you go outside of the State College/central PA bubble people aren’t as in your face about their love for Penn State. It’s literally like a cult, but in this cult they’re all amped up on school spirit and are ready to roid rage at any second. I love my alma matter a lot, but it doesn’t mean I need to act like an asshole about it all the time. Didn’t anyone ever hear about false idols? How about the cult of personality? It’s a pretty good song by Living Colour. No, not the TV show where JLo was a fly girl.

Overall, I'm a fan of Dior's nail polishes. The colors are unique and not always dupable by other brands, although they may seem so at first glance. I picked up both Apparat and Exquis to no surprise but I think all 4 are nice shades. Although I love Exquis the most, I feel like I've seen a similar shade from Dior previously. Perhaps under a different name? As for Or Divin, you can definitely layer it on top of the other shades for a nice golden effect.

Theron immediately took the opportunity to stress differences between Boer and Afrikaner, two words, which are often used interchangeably. In the world-view of the Boer, they alone made the Great Trek from the Cape in the 1830’s to establish independent Boer republics inland, whilst the Afrikaners stayed with the British and got rich. Then the Afrikaners supported the British; the Boer fought them during the Anglo-Boer war of 1899. And in 1994, the Afrikaner leaders betrayed the Boer by giving their land to black South Africans. Theron explained the Boer are deeply, conservatively religious and to survive, believe they need self-determination on land they can call their own.

ANYWAY, C's question made me think of my nice elephant sugar bowls, seen a couple of days ago, and trying, as you see here, something just totally round (2nd row from top) and they look GREAT, I am pleased with that new idea, my old style elephant banks sitting 3rd row from top. The bottom shows 2 types of my small piggy banks, one standard and the other sitting, both small, pocket sized, sort of. I made my first standard pigs when I saw one around '88, just a bottle on the side, etc, but I really like my sitting pig banks, which I started around 2000, and is entirely MY idea. Lastly and superSUPER exciting, on top these Godzilla/dragon/dinosaur banks...a new style of those for me! Sooooo fun, but a lot of work compared to others....

The list of players found in this set is really mind boggling. From Ewing, Robinson and Olajuwon to Barkley, Stockton and Rodman, this set has just about everyone in it. Unfortunately, two glaring omissions are that of Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. I know neither played during the '93 NBA season, but they are in the TSC base set. Otherwise, a checklist for an early 90's set doesn't get much better than this.
By the time the prequels came out, we were still lining up at the local multiplexes and swapping theories in line and trying to remember where we put our vintage lightsabers and Darth Vader helmets. A new generation born when Star Wars first debuted were now standing in line with us. Star Wars was no longer just a blockbuster series of films (oh remember the scorn of the learned film snobs as teenagers flooded back in the movie houses) but now was totally immersed into our cultural and even political folklore. And standing again in line on this date for the next three more films, we too echoed the same greeting as we held our tickets and waited to get into the Uptown on Connecticut Avenue in DC, indeed, "May the 4th be with you."

And speaking of getting attention: I’m auditioning for a GAME SHOW on Thursday. Seriously, if there were ever a game show a) made for me that b) I might actually have a shot at winning some money on, it’s this one. I’ve never actually WATCHED the show, mind you, but I know the premise, and it taps straight into my special gift/curse, which is remembering a ridiculous amount of song lyrics in my tiny little brain. Remember my aunt’s birthday? No chance. Remember every word to “Right Down the Line” by Gerry Rafferty? I’m you’re gal. I’m actually taking a day off of work and going to the auditions, which are from like 7am to 7pm. If I don't get on the show, at least I’ll have some good people-watching story to tell with you freaks.

To put it in traditional theological language, sanctification is not the basis of justification but the inevitable result of justification. Those whom God declares righteous on the basis of their faith in Christ’s work for them, God also makes righteous by the work of his Spirit within them. Those whose lives are characterized only by the expressions of the sinful nature demonstrate that they have not been born by the power of the Spirit. Those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God (v. 21).

For craft brewers, it may pay to keep their options open. New Belgium downplayed the risks in a 2008 online response to a customer's question: "We became aware of BPA in epoxy resin can liners during our due diligence prior to deciding on packaging in cans. We looked into the matter thoroughly. What became apparent is that there are no cans whose lining does not contain BPA. The industry is actively looking for alternatives, but as yet, none exist. We still believe the benefits of cans outweigh the potential risk of the liners because the anxiety surrounding BPA seems to have far outstripped the science."
It’s been just over a year since I first visited Old World and though I didn’t say as much back then, I truly doubted their staying power. Today, nearly a year later, I have to say that my instincts were wrong (as usual). With a bottling and labeling line up and running, and an arrangement for Republic Distributing to proliferate their product, with a deal to sell bombers at places like Fry’s and A.J.’s Fine Foods and an up and coming root beer product, Old World looks to have dug in their heels for the long fight.
Still, we have an OPTION. The first step in getting THE IMMORTAL RULES to the big screen.

Curios and novelty films are generally categorized by their kookiness and occasionally exploitation-type setups. Exploitation cinema generally targets specific obsessions such as blaxploitation, sexploitation, nunsploitation, etc. They find a theme and make the given novelty a sort of mini-genre unto itself. They went in waves…and the surf took a much harder pounding in the 1970s. There was a whole world of movies catering to all sorts of peculiar tastes and usually without the benefit of a large budget. Jungle cannibals, vampire lesbians, shocking violence, schlock monsters, and weird pagan rites abound in this realm.

At the same time, the book tells a different story. It tells a story of a man who has lost his ability to speak and can only communicate by writing in a notebook that he carries around all the time, or by using the palms of his hands on which he’d tattooed “Yes” and “No”, and the woman he’s married to. This woman is the sister of the girl he truly wished to marry before he lost her in the war… and incidentally, she happens to be Oskar’s grandmother. Somewhere along the book, these two stories meet, and the result is rather bittersweet.

One of the delights of my youth were the Saturday matinees where one could see movies starring cowboys like Roy Rogers and his wife Dale Evans, both of whom transitioned to television. Roy was in the tradition of singing cowboy and had a long career. He and Dale had thousands of fans and Tricia Spencer was among them. She has written a delightful book, The Touch of Roy and Dale ($21.95, West Quest, softcover) subtitled, “The impact and influence of Roy Rogers, the King of the Cowboys, and Dale Evans, the Queen of the West, as Only Their Fans Could Tell It.” In the 1990s She acquired a treasure of 40,000 pieces of fan mail from the Rogers estate and draws on them and the collected recollections and essays of their children, family friends, and western silver screen stars and others emerge a picture of a couple who lived their Christian faith. The book is greatly enhanced by many photos from their lives. Roy and Dale left behind a great legacy, including their non-profit charity, The Happy Trails Foundation, that can be enjoyed in this wonderful book.

Paul: Yes, your mind is fallen and fallible. Yes, it is prone to self-justifying errors. But Christ is in the business of renewing the mind (Romans 12:2; Ephesians 4:23). Do you think there is some unfallen part of you that you could substitute for your mind? We are fallen and depraved in every part. You cannot retreat from thinking into some other safe, untainted faculty of knowing. Take note, Timothy; even in raising the objection against thinking, you are thinking! You cannot escape the necessity of thinking. God’s call is to do it well.

That heat would certainly have destroyed anything that might have existed. As mentioned in the article entitled “Indeterminacy”, the energy from the initial singularity would have obliterated anything near it. Because the Indeterminate Point cannot be proven to have physical existence, the other points too remain a matter of speculation.
The governing factor for the licensor, on the other hand, is to determine its goals for optimizing the returns from its own use and/or the sale of technology rights, and then to determine if these goals can be meshed with those of the licensee. Sometimes exclusive or sole licences are given for a limited time period, perhaps three or five years, and then become non-exclusive in case the market targets are not achieved. The exclusivity decision for licensor can be very complicated, especially if the patents extend to foreign countries. It requires careful assessment of which approach will yield the greatest return.

I'm Fernando Ray, and I went out 7 days a week trying to meet people for an entire year during my time at University of Worcester doing my Masters degree. After doing that much hard work socializing and long nights of studying and partying, I got pretty good at basically every aspect of life. But there were strange side effects that I did not expect at all...amazingly positive side effects. Like I became the man who could network and connect with people from every walk of life and immediately start building solid healthy relationships. Not only did I start getting good results in my courses and became good at many areas of my life and got multiple relationships with some of most interesting people around, but I gained massive confidence.

They parallel Bond not so much with 006 but with General Ourumov, a Russian General who was clearly more happy being a Soviet General. He has a scene similar to Bond’s frank discussion with M but where Bond’s decision is to put the job first, Ourumov puts himself first and sides with 006 to steal the GoldenEye weapon that Russia has developed.

On Friday, I was stuck in a shit section for lunch. Four tables (no booths) in an area nobody wants to sit in. Every other server had 5+ tables.... for some reason, I got screwed. Normally, I get great sections, but... c'est la vie. On top of this, I had three of my tables reserved for a party that was due to come in at 12:30 PM. So I spent the first hour of my shift twiddling my thumbs, folding napkins, and helping other servers. For my entire seven and a half hour shift, I only had one party of 13 and a 3 top. That's it. Once the party was done at 3:30 PM, management would not let me leave! Even though the entire restaurant completely died, I was held prisoner until the dinner crew came on. Here's what I accomplished:
Perhaps one of the most horrifying aspects of this situation is not that people who knew the girls and the family are saying “we didn’t know” (that’s bad enough), but that bureaucrats and police officers are candidly admitting they knew, but they were too afraid of acting and offending cultural sensibilities!

In all of this the PM has remained characteristically silent.
The above pictures are a good example of how my day is full of chaos & distractions…seriously even with teens at school & hubby at work…the animals, doorbell, phone, computer & chores distract me. This is Tinkerbell, she is my daughter’s cat but she adopts me when Alexa is at school…I’m so thankful for that…yeah I am…hahahaha! She is ANNOYING!!! OMGosh I love her to bitz but she drives me NUTZO!! She wants to be ON me, on whatever I’m coloring…sitting on my laptop, eating paper, dragging embellies off the desk. And the whole time she wants to HEAD BUTT me….yes head butts…her & her brother like to head butt us…its cute the first couple of times, but after the 20th time I’ve had enough. Seriously I would get SO much more done if I put all 7 of my animals in animal-daycare…not sure anyone would want all 7 but it sure would help a girl out!! Do you feel my pain…you feelin’ me…do you have similar issues? LOL—vent to me..make me feel better..tell me your stories!

I'm sure that I'll hear it again, as we trek to all our relatives' houses for Christmas, and I know that they mean well, that they really mean nothing by it - but please, I ask of you, try not to make such careless comments. Try to keep the talk fat-free.

"Hello?" I said, out of breath from wrestling over a teddy bear and in no mood for chatting.
Not long after we moved there the house was redecorated throughout with dark brown and cream paint which in those days contained lead. The smell really upset our stomachs in spite of bowls of water standing about to absorb it. The toilet was across the yard which meant in bad weather a mad dash so as not to get wet. Another problem was in the dark trying to keep a candle lit! Neatly cut rectangles of the E.D.P. were suspended on string on the back of the door. We took our weekly baths in the kitchen or scullery in a galvanized bath. At the beginning of the war a grand-daughter of an old lady who lived in a cottage at the top of the yard joined the W.A.A.F.s (Womens Auxiliary Air Force). When she came home on leave my mother used to invite her to use our bathroom. Mum’s contribution to the war effort! I hurriedly add this was after a bathroom and toilet had been fitted into the small bedroom or box room over the scullery!
There are really no crops ready for the market yet at this time of year so winter comfort food will have to continue to soothe and comfort while we wait for the robust growing season to kick in.

I didn’t get a photo or video of it. However, maybe when I snatch 160 I will get a video haha! They are usually more so for me to be able to look at my technique and correct things than to say “look at me.” I usually hesitate to post photos or videos, but, I know a lot of people always message me saying they appreciate it. I guess I just like to quietly go about my business and train. Anyway, time to eat some supper and get ready for a big day tomorrow!

I have to admit it felt a little show-villagey (which of course it is), even though the Pueblo people live on its fringes and make and sell their crafts from within the adobe complex. But there is no better example of sun-dried earth and straw buildings in New Mexico. (A little more disconcerting is the juxtaposition of rustic clay pueblo with the great lumbering pickup trucks driven by the inhabitants because, of course, the Native Americans run the phalanx of casinos dotted all over their land. Illegal on American territory but perfectly legal on the Indian reservations.)
The ancient ancestors of these dogs had not always been domesticated. They were wolves; they roamed and hunted, wild and free. But a change of heart had occurred somewhere down their blood line. The fierce nature of these erstwhile pack hunters seems far-fetched now.
There I chose silk scarves patterned with designs that are traditionally woven into wool or embroidered onto kumma, frankincense (about which, exactly as predicted, Chuck said, “Smells like church!”), a mask-style niqab dyed in indigo, and some silver rings and necklaces. I love the silver!

A recent poll commissioned by Generation Opportunity, a non-profit think tank that concerns itself with young Americans, found that “just 31% of 18-29-year-olds approve of Obama’s handling of youth unemployment while 69% say the current leadership in Washington fails to reflect the interests of the younger generation.” That is very bad news for Obama and, if they vote, very good news for Romney.

She agreed, and the result was the drawing at the top of this page. The Souza is the green character on the right.

We just finished the new blog yesterday, and I was tempted to press 'printscreen' just to show you all a sneak peek, but that would just spoil the fun. But I promise the wait will be worth it. We've already shared the page with a few people and I'm excited to share it with the rest of you in a couple of weeks! In the meantime, we're working on the website which is the main cake baking in the oven - its a HUGE amount of work to be trawling through 3 years worth of photos and putting them all into the website.

Thank goodness Phoebe, Barbara’s eldest daughter, took her mother by the elbow and the rest of the women fell into step behind them as they started for the barn. Abby remained behind, checking the stove burners and looking to be sure any perishable food was in the fridge. Her other nieces, Ruthie and Gail–her namesake–finished draping clean dish towels over the hot casseroles and then filed outside ahead of her with their heads bowed. It felt more like they were going to a funeral, even though their new dresses were the rich colors of fall foliage rather than black.
Anyway, the odd part was, despite having such a rough day (he’d actually had a sixth “episode” in the morning while still with Lindy), he was in a great mood. He’s still not letting things get him down. We had a great ride home (I sometimes reach back to the back seat while I drive so he and I can hold hands; he’ll then prop one foot on my arm just kicking back), he had a great dinner, and a fun time bath. And now he’s started doing something really positive — sitting normally. Because of the weakness in his core/trunk/tummy area, he tends to sit in a W to help with added support. However, lately, he’s started getting himself into a more normal position with one or both legs almost straight out. Even in the bathtub, he had his legs out and caught himself as he was starting to fall backwards.
Though the majority of netizens want Sun Xu’s scholarship to be revoked and NUS to expel, few believe NUS will do so with many predicting that he will be let off with simply a ‘stern warning’ which will have no impact on his scholarship.

Bake for 20 - 30 minutes or until the cake is golden brown and starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. Avoid opening the oven door for the first 20 minutes. Test toward the end of the baking time and just crack the oven door a bit to peak in and see if it is done. Touch the center of the cake with one finger if it leaves a finger print it is not done. Leave it in for 5 more minutes.

The mute slave escorted me quickly through the handsome back-courtyard of the Cicero household, up a sharply curving staircase and through a wooden door, attended by a dim glow of light from a brazier (lit around 5 hours ago.) Cautiously, I rounded a corner, finding myself abandoned by my guide and stepped into the triclinium. Mosaics of cavorting fish and all manner of other sea-life glistened all over the floors, accompanied by a simple geometric pattern as a border. A single rose stood in one corner of the room, but, paying this no heed, I was transfixed by the two men in front of me. One sat in the corner (Name: Tiro, Cicero’s freedman), calmly ready to take notes on a wax tablet (Tironian Shorthand, a method formulated himself), while the other, a man known as the finest undisputed orator to cross the face of the world, Marcus Tullius Cicero, who, in a change to his usual manner, was frantically pacing back and forth.

I was not an expert on puking at that point. I was the complete opposite of an expert. She puked straight down my shirt. Vomit blasted into my bra and flowed straight through to my waist.

2. Samuel Eto’o's goal in the 91st minute against Lokomotiv put Anzhi up 3-1. Check out his celebration after scoring: Eto’o! (0:28-0:35). I have a decidedly negative opinion of Russian policemen after all the abuse I, my family, and many friends have suffered at their hands. This is the first time in my life that I’ve associated positive emotions with them and their navy blue uniforms.
But, in fact, it was not boring at all. The coherence of design made it feel more transporting than outdated. It wasn’t too grand nor too somber. It was unbelievably tidy and sunny. You could smoke almost anywhere, even when they asked you not to. It was quiet. It was, to put it plainly, a dentist’s waiting room the size of the World’s Fair.

“As recently as a week ago, Deb Fischer was dismissed by the establishment. Why?

It’s funny, this morning started out pretty badly – one thing after another went wrong as I was getting ready for work (like all of the ice in the ice cube tray falling and scattering across the floor while the tray bounced and then broke – random, I know), and I was nearly late. Being late is not an option as a teacher, so it always stresses me out to even think that it might be a possibility. But instead of focusing on the stressful start, I shook it off, and just went on with the day.

And then there's Dirk Gently ... which seems to have done exactly the opposite to Being Human. While Being Human has got too fantastic, Dirk Gently isn't fantastic enough. This is a show that demands big world-changing themes ... but it falls flat. Stephen Mangan is perfect in the role; he is Dirk. He's exactly how I always imagined the character to be and the always excellent Darren Boyd is great as sidekick Richard MacDuff. Yes, I know MacDuff's character is fundamentally different from the book but changes always have to be made when converting a book to a film or TV. They are different media and what works in one doesn't necessarily work in another. However, that isn't my beef.

In relation to the terms which compose it, the sign CARGO PARTNER does not present any additional characteristic capable of making the sign as a whole appropriate to distinguish the services of the applicant from those of other undertakings in the mind of the relevant public.
What's it all about? Serious Emily meets her complete opposite in Duck, who she first sees riding a unicycle, wearing socks. Duck's outfits get increasingly crazy, but always with a valid excuse: cold feet makes him wear socks; a business meeting sees him wearing a tie. Emily struggles to remain serious in the face of this ludicrous duck, and finally gives in to the absurdity, much to Duck's amusement.

This morning, at 7:30 AM, I had my two week follow-up from my surgery. We arrived on time and didn’t have to wait very long before going to the back. The nurse took a little information and sent the cast technician in to remove the splint. This took a little bit of time but nothing major and it was nice to get some freedom even though I could barely move my foot. After the splint was off they rolled me down to get an xray done which was pretty uneventful.

Rosie congratulated me for the job well done.
Will the world face the threat from a massive solar storm in Solar Cycle 24? An increase in the number of cumulative spotless days during a solar minimum appears to correlate to a reduction in the number of sunspots over the entire solar cycle. The old solar cycles produced overall 38% fewer International Sunspot Numbers than the recent solar cycles. Since the old solar cycles produced fewer sunspots, one might draw the conclusion that we will be entering a period of reduced solar storms. But historical observations show this is not true. It is quite the opposite. The old solar cycles produced very intense solar storms. Massive solar storms in the old solar cycles occurred on 1-2 September 1859, 12 October 1859, 4 February 1872, 17-18 November 1882, 30 March 1894, 31 October 1903, 25 September 1909 and 13-16 May 1921. How can this be? This is because the old solar cycles produced massive sunspots. It was as if the magnetic field energy still existed and still had to be vented but during a shorter time interval, so the sunspots exploded in size and power.
The buses in Buenos Aires are roaring great works of art. Each numbered route has its own graphic identity - made up of a particular typeface, colour combinations and patterns. The number 29 has a great big 29 painted on the front in a sloping stylised font, white on a blue background. Down the sides blue, red, white and yellow stripes are the background for elaborate text detailing the route the bus takes. The big capital letters are filled in with shiny hologram effect stickers. The visual impact of all these elements combined is quite astonishing. And joyful! As if to remind us that buses aren't just metal boxes carting people around the city, they are giant, moving, ever-changing, interactive sculptures, where strangers are brought together, sit close, get chatting, overhear each others conversations.

The American vernacular is replete with culturally stereotypical sayings. ‘Birds of a feather, flock together’; ‘you are known by the company you keep’; and ‘it takes one to know one’ are indicative of cultural acknowledgement of stereotyping. There are others. ‘Dress for success’; ‘look the part, act the part’; and ‘first impressions are lasting impressions’ are usually considered ‘good’ stereotypical connotations. But even these cultural admonitions have the catch phrase, ‘you can’t tell a book, by its cover’, meaning that what you see isn’t necessarily what you get. It also implies that looks can be deceiving, and that actions make not be what they seem.

We will sleep in the hotel overnight and anxiously await word that our passports have arrived. Until then, we will conserve money as much as possible because our cash flow problem is still unknown. We are beyond grateful for the courtesy of the Xuan Wu Hotel here in Wudangshan, as they have showered us with kindness and generosity and are letting us stay overnight when there is no guarantee that we will be able to pay them. Rob asks me why people think that we look so pathetic. I remind him that the gravity of our situation is wearing heavily on our faces and that honestly, everyone is responding more to the presence of our children, than to us. I have no doubt that if it were Rob and I traveling alone, we would not have been so readily showered with money and food. People want to make sure that children are taken care of and looked after. And in China, they want to make sure that they are fed.
- North Carolina has a law to ban people from swearing in front of cadavers. The law also sets out guidelines transporting the recently deceased after one funeral firm was caught piling stiffs onto the back of a pick-up truck. It outlaws 'profanity, indecent or obscene language in the presence of a dead human body' making it technically illegal to say the 'f' word in front of a hearse!

Our hotel was in Miraflores which is a province in Lima. This is a very touristy spot and cops make their presence known on practically every corner.

It’s not difficult to get by if you don’t speak Spanish.

Björk says the Cubes didn't give the tiniest toss about the backlash. "Because we'd been doing some sort of terrorism in Iceland for eight years previously, we were perhaps guilty of a little bit of arrogance," she says drily. "If it was Kukl getting slagged maybe we'd have been devastated. But The Sugarcubes was more about taking the piss. Only two members of the band were into music as the most important thing in their lives. For the other four, it was poetry. We thought it was going to be a party band for a couple of months, then it just kept going and we were, 'We're going to do another album?! Er, okay'."

Even Ellen not talking to her for a week didn’t change things. Finally, a week or two before graduation, she seemed to come around. Whatever she was pissed about, whatever happened I guess she made peace with it. I was glad to have the old Becky back. As much as I always tried to support her, even I was getting tired of being her target. Why is it that the people we care about the most are the ones we hurt the most?
It is a sobering thought for people in the 1990's to realize that the very first liberation war against colonial masters was in fact fought by the White Boers against the White British colonialist - preceding any Black liberation war by many decades. It can be argued that only an indigenous people can wage a liberation war, and that this therefore shows once again that the Boers had by this stage firmly established themselves as an indigenous people of Africa.

December 27th I’ve noted that I was at the shop. We were closed still for the holidays as we’d usually given our employees the week off with pay as a Christmas present. I noted “At shop 3:30pm, found Rob at 2:15pm 1 year ago – amazing how much difference 1 year makes.” Am not exactly sure what I meant about 1 year making so much difference, but although in some ways it felt like a lifetime ago that Rob had died, in other ways, it felt like little to no time had gone by.
Story yesterday of “helping” the weakest 16 banks in Europe to recapitalize was met with a strong rally, quickly followed by a sell-off to new lows. The realization that the EU has gangrene and decided to deal with some warts brought back the fear the the governments are once again behind the curve and just don’t get it. Then we rallied into the close because the G-20 would of course save us. So far, not so much. A wishy washy statement is just not enough for a market that has come to expect (if not depend) on more. The BRIC’s are supposed to ride to the rescue, but in Brazil, the currency has been getting crushed, Chinese CDS is hitting new wides. Brazil is busy imposing tariffs on China. Russia is complaining about Chinese dumping. Hardly the signs of a co-ordinated effort to rescue the world.
Soil requirements: in my experience, They need soil, but don’t seem to be too picky. Over the several acres that we grow them, some are in loamy, sandy soil, others are in clay, and everything in between. They look great everywhere.
This is what I would've worn had I gone in, instead of sleeping most of the afternoon. I appear to have fallen in love with the chambray trend a bit after everyone else. I paired my shirt with floral and pleats and comfy shoes (since my feet are all still blistered from the 10K). I am also wearing my nerd glasses non-stop. I really liked the combination and while it felt a bit casual for the office it was definitely comfortable for waiting in the doctor's office.
You may need the hammer to dislodge the old hinge. It’s most likely been there for a while, and it will need a little push to get it off. (I knock it from below the hinge a few times and it works great.)
“…you are not going to convince anyone by saying they are ignorant and morons.” I’m not really trying to convince anyone of anything, I’m just calling it like I see it. I’m sick and tired of arguing about arguing. Now, if you would like to get back to the actual topic at hand, which was about metaphors in the bible that were originally meant to be taken literally, that would be more worth my time. That is why I didn’t respond to your first comment, because most of what I did read had NOTHING to do with that topic. If you would like to discuss that, then I will try to debunk your claims if I see them worthy of even considering, but if you are just going to keep arguing about arguing, then I am done with this conversation, because it is a complete waste of my time and battery-life.
Not just that, since he is in choo-choo train fever, he even digged out a choo-choo train storybook from his bookshelf to accompany the toy train. This photo was taken in the car when he insisted to bring the choo-choo train book while going to the babysitter's house. ^_^

Martin's Ineluctable Elevator
The first son went and bought a big tree, after cutting it down, he dragged it to the room, it filled up about half the room with its leaves and branches. The second son went and bought the kunai grass that some of the farmers were cutting in their fields, this filled up most of the room.

Here's what I wore to the office on Wednesday. Even with fall weather coming in, I still feel like I'm in a bit of a style rut, wearing the same skirt/tank/cardigan or dress/cardigan combos. I'm a little bored with work right now, so I suppose it'd make sense that I'm bored with my work wear.

Thanks to so many similarities between the agencies (let's face it: after 20 years everyone eventually settles in to a similar set of procedures for doing the same work) I've never had trouble adapting to a new job. The longest was about 5 weeks at the aforementioned 500+ employee agency. I absolutely hated it during those initial weeks and then everything started to click. It was the peak of my career in so many ways.
At the beginning you are given noise-cancelling headphones and a pair of goggles, inside which is projected a film. Once deprived of all other senses you are put in a wheelchair, as per careful instructions from the headphones, and witness the story. The soundtrack tells you where to look, how to move, what to expect, and the video plays in front of you, within the frame of the goggles. Occasionally there's some physical stimulus - a quick spray of alcohol, mirroring an event in the film, or some air-freshener and a fan to simulate the outdoors - but these felt as inexact as seeing someone else's hand substituting for mine in the visuals. This inexactness made the dissociation between the sensual expectation and reality jarring, and if anything it placed me further outside the experience.
The ANC have not stopped singing its songs of war, and the words written in Helen and Alice Lotter's blood were "Kill the Boer". The evil dream is still alive. Bloody genocide of whites is the flame at the centre of that dream and it takes only the right set of circumstances, or a single event, for such a carefully nurtured flame to ignite into an inferno.

After England, there is a likelihood I will be in Stockholm the evenings of the 18th & 19th, Budapest the 20th, 21st & 22nd, Barcelona the evening of the 23rd. I don't have all my plane tickets yet, and only one of the hotels, so what I'm actually doing is utterly unformed.
Of the 2,759 robberies committed in Chicago in 2009, 2,352 of those robberies were committed by African-Americans, which means that African-Americans are responsible for 85.2 percent of robbery in Chicago.

The term comprachico is very uncommonly used in modern English except in reference or allusion to the antiquated folklore, but similar stories do exist in the English speaking world. For instance, a tale circulating since at least the 1980s tells of a Japanese bride who disappears during her honeymoon in Europe; years later her husband discovers she has been abducted, mutilated, and forced to work in a freak show.
After I was done recording and the camera was turned off, I went back out and loped some more, where I found her much more relaxed and we settled into a rhythm. We had a much better ride, and I wish that part of my ride would have been recorded on video instead of the footage I now have.
I’ve stopped running but I really want to go back to it. I need to go back to it. I can feel myself falling out of shape and I hate that. So I’m going to start running again on Monday. This time I promise it’s going to work. It’s actually affecting my dancing at this point so I know that dancing isn’t enough and I need to start running again to support my endurance. It makes dancing so much more fun when I can actually breath!

Even though we are so very blessed to live on the water, being near sailboats or boats of any sort makes me feel at home. Maybe it's because I have been on the water since I was born really, heck, my baby book shows that my first boat ride was long before I could even walk.
The second clerk is a slightly older female who does not look in a hurry or troubled in any way. Each person who arrives at her till is met with a pleasant demeanor as she measures each piece of mail with her tape measure or adds more packing tape to a package to make sure it will not come apart in the mail. She is definitely not in a hurry, no matter how long the line in front of her.
Naturally, reporters ran to 911 victims’ relatives to get their reaction. No surprise, they were disgusted and outraged. So what did the star of current mega-hit movie “Contraband” ($28.5 million weekend gross) do? Mr. Wahlberg issued this statement:

For the last two months The Slog has been digging into a case (by no means isolated) of three very prominent Russian business people based in the UK. The insider descriptions given to me about the equipment they have, the security at their offices – and the overheard conversations after too much vodka – leave me in no doubt that this trio is making fortunes by blagging into everything from liquidity pools to senior boardroom minutes and fund management mobile phones. In many cases, the victims know what’s happened – but are themselves operating outside the law, and thus daren’t bring in the police.
I've also signed up for a Teen Screen program put on by Columbia University to help out in local high schools with teens who may be going through a rough time, as part of an anti-bullying outreach. This is something I'm super excited and passionate about. I was bullied in high school. Though I never let it get to me, I hated the uncomfort some older girls caused during my high school years.
Fifteen years pass, I am pregnant and married, and we are still visiting frequently, spending holidays, weekends together. We have invested much more in each other. I want to be able to tell myself I have a good family, so I ignore my reactions to his expectations, ignore my gut instincts that tell me this isn't healthy, that this doesn't honor me. He was the first one at the hospital. He was the first family member to hold our son. He was so excited, so full of love. I don't know what happened. It all changed so quickly. Although I had intended to return to my job, at the last minute, we decided that my staying home would be the best option for our family. I asked him for help as we eased into the transition. In response, my dad said, "You are bringing financial ruin to your family. I cannot support you, and I cannot watch you do this." He meant it. He told me it was the worst decision of my life, and abruptly ended

Horatio met hers with a grin of his own as he flicked the feather playfully, teasing her nose and lips, taking joy at the site of her exquisite face squishing comically from the tickling of the feather. She was beautiful, he thought as he gazed into her dark, almond shaped eyes. His heart skipped a beat as she locked her gaze to his own hazel eyes.

For decades now, Mother's Day swoops in in May and steals my joy, bringing to my knees as tears fall and I mourn what has been lost. I have dreaded Mother's Day for so long that I have had no idea how to embrace it. I have been blessed with healthy children and being their mother is an honor like no other. I want to celebrate that, yet I've not known how. The void is too big, too gaping and too raw.

Don’t you think the movie is so realistic? I know I do. Except for some itsy bitsy details but yeah, it’s realistic all right. My sister is in a long distance relationship. She and her boyfriend not only live in different states, but 2 different freaking countries with very different timezones. Philippines and Canada. And she remains a rockstar. The video scene in the movie, the one were Drew and Justin watch a video of a panda or something, my sister and her boyfriend do the same thing. They download movies and watch it at the same time. It’s their date, which at first was kinda creepy, but when you think about it, is actually superdeeduper sweet.
All of a sudden the score was tied 4-4 and Colorado had all the momentum. The Mets had a chance to strike back in the top of the ninth when David Wright walked and later moved to third on a balk, but with one out Scott Hairston struck out and then Ike Davis roped a liner right into second baseman Marco Scutaro’s glove. In the bottom of the ninth, Bobby Parnell took down the Rockies in order, and we were off to extra innings.

Returning to the trauma room, a grimace and shake of the surgeon's head told it all and the code was called a moment later. My patient worked in one of our ICUs, so I figured it was okay to tell him what was going on. That piqued his interest, he had been hearing the traumas being announced for hours, and he asked about working with us. I told him we had some people give notice and I gave him the names of some managers. He may be disappointed when he finds out that we don't open up chests every day.

This is of course absolute rubbish. It may be they are the only nations that have an internal passport that takes the form of a little book that looks like the standard international passport we all recognise, but that it because many nations now use a national identity card rather than an internal passport. The principle though is exactly the same. A national ID system.

So, J likes Reddit, and I don't really read it so I'll probably butcher this explanation, but there's this one forum on Reddit called Forever Alone where people write about how Forever Alone they are. (It hails back to some internet meme, if I'm not mistaken.) And it's mostly self-deprecating but sometimes really sad, actually: people will say things like, I'm geeky. I've never kissed anyone. I ordered two extra-large pizzas because there was a sale and when the deliveryman came I called "Pizza's here, guys!" to my empty house so he wouldn't think they were just for me.

One of the points made in the study was that the earthquakes were small measuring at 1.5 and 2.3 on the richter scale. These were not strong enough to cause any structural damage and therefore not a major safety issue. However, as seen in the United States minor earthquakes is not the main issue at hand.
First, full disclosure. I DO believe that yoga and meditation are powerful and good techniques that people can use to manage stress and lead healthier and happier lives. Moreover, I have no doubt that five-year-olds have stress in their lives. I have a five-year-old who worries that if he wears a raincoat to school the other kids will laugh at him. He worries that his seven-year-old sister can read and he can’t. He worries that his friends all have PSPs and he doesn’t.

In 1992-93, I was a junior at Montgomery High School in south San Diego and writing for the school newspaper. At some point during the school year, a teenager was shot and killed at Plaza Bonita in National City and the only thing that I remember being shocked about was that it happened in the mall that my friends and I went to. Roughly a week after the murder, Junior Seau gave a speech at the mall and invited every high school newspaper to send one reporter and one photographer for a mini-press conference before his public speech. Since I was the only underclassmen writing for the sports section, my editor and advisor felt that I should go. Being a sports nut, I was thrilled to have the opportunity to meet Mr. Seau–a native San Diegan, graduate of Oceanside High and (at the time) All-Pro linebacker for the Chargers.

Like my father, Clarke was born in Philadelphia. Her real name was Violet Mary Klotz and I guess you can safely say she never really transcended her Klotzness. Despite looking pretty good in a tight sateen flapper-style gown and having had some critical success, she was really never anything but two-bit. She never became the star she wanted to be.

The Public Employment Relations Commission (PERC) is the supreme arbiter in public labor relations matters – more or less in the same fashion as the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is for the private sector. New Jersey Law for the public sector has the provision of No Strike/No Lockout. In contractual disputes, the path is Negotiations – Fact Finding – Mediation – Arbitration. Contrary to what governor Christie and even the press have said, the power of the arbitrators is limited by the framing of the issue. For example, if the dispute is over wages, the arbitrator can not include in his/her award anything other than money. If the arbitrator exceeds his/her scope, any of the parties – or both in a joint petition – can ask PERC to overturn the award.
I also hate the fact that most people would only remember you if it’s your birthday. They would ask for a “birthday treat”, or expect to be invited to a “party” even though the only existing communication we have is once a year, through text.

Worldbook: 1925—a poem, on the other hand, is playful in its use of where it comes from. A little reading in it will reveal its source as the 1925 edition of the famous encyclopedia volume “from A to Bee” as it says on the title page. The language may all be found there. The composition is what we’re after. Diction encompassing everything teaches what a mindset is like. The composition gives the critical angle, and it’s hilarious. From the simplicity of “XVIII.”:

In addition, conventional medicine is often unable to treat these chronic diseases. Patients are now health care consumers, and will seek their own resolution to health problems that cannot be resolved by conventional physicians.

Deployment requests are issued by the federal government, governor or state government, local law enforcement, or relief organizations (e.g. Red Cross). When deployed, the team works under and abides by the hierarchy and guidelines of the Incident Command System (ICS). If deployed by local law enforcement they act as a function of that department and answer directly to them. Though they don’t perform actual criminal law enforcement duties, they do act as needed in a support role for the department. On average, the team responds to a missing person callout every other month. The biggest incident the team has responded to was Hurricane Ike when they were deployed on Day 3 following the hurricane for three straight weeks.
As I would sit there in the candle light, listening to worship music and scrawling my prayers on the walls, an amazing thing would happen. In my heart, I would find myself entering the throne room of heaven, standing before the King. He would always beckon me to sit on His lap and spend some time with my head on His shoulder. Now you may think that is crazy, but it was as real to me as my husband standing before me.

I don't want to go into whether the programs are worthwhile. I don't know enough of the details to say which one are or are not. But Federalizing a lot of the local responsibilities allowed the country as a whole to pay for its security through the borrowing/money printing that occurs at the Federal expenditure level. The States cannot do this. They can borrow money, but they cannot print money by lending money to themselves. So in the end their books have to balance.

The second element was something I've mentioned previously. When things were really bad, emotionally, I was a mess. Perhaps oddly, logically, I was with it. It was almost as if the logical side could say "Yes, it hurts. Really hurts, but you can beat this. Don't give up."

One call to the station and this is all over. Following a lead on the Internet. Plaudits, promotion, newspaper articles, talk shows, interviews in magazines. He’ll be a hero.
there really are no rules, you can pretty much interpret this however
For my first ornament I chose Christmas Cat Tree by Brittercup Designs from this year's Just Cross Stitch Ornament Issue. I'm stitching on 28ct Antique White Jazzlyn from Wichelt Importers using DMC floss. I didn't get very far but at least it's a start! lol The colors are a bit faded on this picture as I had to use the flash.

I have never liked diet drinks. Never, ever. The taste of artificial sweetener makes me sick to my stomach.
Every time Dad has come to visit & Lenny was in the barn or near where we were, he'd just smile. Smile & remember that little runt calf sucking on his finger. As he aged, Lenny's disposition remained wonderful! He was never a bull to be mean or aggressive. In fact, we never left him with the other bulls because they'd pick on him. Even the little bulls would pick on him. Lenny sired Ultimate & Freedom, many more & just a week ago Lacey (my pet cow) had a Lenny Bull Calf.
It's been a while since I provided y'all with a house update. Feel free to skip the post entirely if you just want to know when our bags our packed and we're moving. Unfortunately, we're not quite there yet. So while this post may be dry, I want to document the house hunting experience (maybe more for me than for my readers).
The card is a 6x6 and btw I use 6x6 CTMH white cardstock for great strength in these lage cards. I combined 2 beautiful papers - the yellow is actually embossed in glitter and the floral/heart piece is one I've used before on this blog and love it to pieces. I put vellum over that section to mute it a little bit as I wanted the glittered wings of the dragonfly to really stand out. The lotus was colored with copics and I used a nestie to double mat everything. I fussy cut the dragonfly and pop dotted it away from the page but attached 3 of its legs to the page, to give it better stability.

This is the only bathroom in our 1920's rental. It serves our family of four and thankfully my girls are not old enough to want/need/know about brushes and curling irons and make-up because we'd have no room to store it.
This is an interesting concept, but to determine it in practice (with a real language) would take an obscene amount of time and probably a computer to do the number crunching. Or grad students. Grad students are good for that sort of thing. But it was something I was thinking about, so I figured I’d share it.
So, let the bidding begin!
Hope everyone had a wonderful halloween!
But even with all the added action, there is a lot of stupid special effects here, thanks to Franco Di Girolamo, Francesco Paolocci, Gaetano Paolocci and Rodolfo Torrente, who must have found some extra ketchup packets somewhere, along with some of that practical joke gum that makes your mouth turn nasty colors (which explains the multiple colors of drool) and an apparent bucket of magic ab oil for ol' Jeff, there.

Blogger? I understand that you had server issues and that's what caused the nearly 30 hour outage last week. I get it. I pay nothing for the privilege of using your site for this little blog so I don't have much bitch-and-moan room. But I'm bummed about you deleting the comments from my last post. I love hearing from my 8 or 10 regular readers, and not being able to read what they had to say made me sad.
I used gold and white paper and mod-podged a wooden egg. I then colored up the lovely Rose in shades of yellowy gold (Y11, 21, 23, 26, 28). I cur out Rose, and then I trimmed her up a little to allow me to mold it to the egg. So where the back hairline meets the front hairline I cut it to the rose, and then tucked the back hair slightly under the front portion. I did the same with her hair on the side.
HEALTH activists who believe even one alcoholic drink can cause cancer are lobbying MPs in Canberra today for limits on how much we consume and how much we pay for it.

The new year is quickly approaching. It is the one day you are expected to party. When I was younger, I would throw a party and just make sure there was enough liquor to make sure everybody was very, very happy. Now, food is the main focus. How things has changed the older you get. I do find that for a new year party, appetizers are perfect choice. You could eat, mingle, and drink easily. When you need to make multiple small dishes, any help you could get is appreciated. As you may know, I have been using various tools to . I utilized the help of the Pillsbury Doughboy to make pepper and cheese pinwheels. The filling is similar to my Pimento Cheese recipe but I didn't have pimento cheese nor cheddar. I had roasted red peppers and velvita. Yep, velveeta. We have strange stuff in my house at times.

I had been dozing in my seat and stretched to get a bit more comfortable. Cool air was blowing on my face but I was nice and warm having wrapped myself up in the blanket that was provided. I opened my eyes and saw the wee lights they have on the roof of the plane twinking away like stars so decided to open the blind and have a peer out the window. The sky was split in two by a band of deep orange....the bottom half was a smokey blue/purple colour.....exactly like the colour of black grapes, above it was the band of deep orange and above that was a cloudless dark blue.....and the best bit.....I could still see a tiny sliver of crescent moon. (I found a pic that looked similar)

When I started my illustrious career at Notre Dame, I joked with anyone who would listen that I would really enjoy it when I finally got to meet Regis. Once there, I upped the ante to proclaiming that I wasn't graduating from Notre Dame until I met Regis.

Earlier this year a cyclone hovered about 100km away from our seaside town and we could feel the winds from the edge of the low pressure system. The wind created large waves which pounded on the shore and one day the waves started to break through the ‘first ridge’, something which the locals had never seen happen. After about 10 days the cyclone eventually moved further out to sea.
I'm the middle child of three girls, I've had the same best friends since kindergarten and I talk to (and more often than not, see) my best friend from college everyday. So, choosing my bridesmaids was a cinch. But asking? There's a lot of pressure there!
I’m sorry but hope is not a strategy and freedom has a price.
Option 2: We also like the look of this pedestal sink. This would cost about half the price (or less) of the above console table. I know pedestal sinks aren't typically used in a three piece bathroom, but the added built-in storage should make up for the lack of cabinetry, so maybe that is not a big deal?
Drying Baby? Place baby on the softest of towels, and with lots of hugging and squeezing and gentle rubbing remove most of the water. Drying Sweater? Place sweater on the softest of towels. Press most of the water out of the sweater. DO NOT ALLOW THE TOWEL OR THE SWEATER TO MOVE. FELTING WILL OCCUR. When most of the water has been removed, carefully pin a diaper on baby, and cover with warm clothes. Place sweater, uncovered, on a flat surface in a warm area and carefully pin it in place to the desired measurements. Allow to air dry. DO NOT ALLOW THE AIR OR THE SWEATER TO MOVE. FELTING WILL OCCUR.
And what is also so strange about this is…HOW THE HELL DID HE GET HIRED BY A GOVERNMENT-FUNDED SCIENTIFIC BUILDING? He has a criminal history! Do they just not do any background checks on their employees? “Hey, I know this guy was arrested thirty years ago for doing illegal experiments and has been in a mental ward ever since, but I really think he’s perfect for our scientist building as a janitor! NOTHING BAD could possibly result from this!” USE YOUR BRAINS YOU MONGOLOIDS.

Turtle Medicine transports us between dimensions, from waking to dreamtime awareness and back. It helps us to slow down our thoughts and the very frequency that keeps the earth drama in play. As you close your eyes and visualize Turtle Medicine, it is so easy to see the form of Turtle as the Earth Mother, swimming effortlessly through the vastness of space. Touch and feel the hard shell beneath your feet. Listen and feel on the inside as breath slows down and thoughts fall away. Your connection with the Earth can be felt as an ancient memory, a distant playing of song that can be heard in the farthest periphery of awareness. You ride upon the back of Turtle Medicine, through skies and ocean…through all dimensions!

Three is another Canon P&S. We bought this used because it came with a full underwater housing. We really like having a camera with underwater capabilities. So much of our memories of crossing the Pacific are entwined with snorkeling among the amazing sea life.
Another very wonderful book - but hard to get hold of - is “Women of Marrakech” by Leonora Peets, a Lithuanian doctor’s wife who lived in Marrakech between 1929 and 1970. A really fascinating glimpse into the very cloistered world of Marrakshi women. Some rather spooky stories here too.

Do you remember this? I designed it for a custom order for a new Easter baby and the lady that it was made for was so delighted with it that I decided to knit up a few for my new Etsy shop. I still have another one in stock in Newborn size, so pop over to my shop here if you want to have a look. I also have a couple of cardigans in my Spring Basket design......

Amadou Toumani Toure returned to the politcal scene in 2002 when the former army general was elected president and again re-elected in 2007. On March 22nd however, Mr. Toure was on the other side of a coup for once as soldiers overthrew his government. The main reason for the coup was the army felt they weren’t receiving sufficient support in their fight against Tuareg rebels. The rebels have been trying take control of Azawad region in Northern Mali which they believe belongs to them.
In fact, from 1950 to the end of the original gravity system in 1992, the average OG was always within the range 1036.9-1038.2, although this masked the long-term decline of mild and an offsetting reduction in the strength of bitter.
Eventually, we went to camp authorities and said we needed longer distances to run. We somehow got permission to run to town and back. Which we did, about three times a week. Though sometimes we hitched back instead, the six of us piled in the back of a compliant pickup truck.

For those who have not seen it, “Our Town” is about the appreciation of life and savoring the beauty around us, among several other themes. The closing act deals with death, patience and values. It was a fitting thing for us to watch in light of where we were.
The salad section looks perfectly inoffensive - and we'll be having a good looksie over these cards to see if we can add in some ideas to our 'pack in the good stuff and eat more salad and vege' challenge.

After all of that, we went out to dinner just the two of us and talked over his thoughts and agreed that God could really use this in our children's lives as well as our own. We both want our children to be as equipped as possible at communicating God's truth to those around them and love the Biblical worldview and we felt this was a big focus of this opportunity.

(e) Alternatively, encourage a détente by establishing informal communication with Israel, as they did in 2005. In doing so, Pakistan could strengthen its role as a liaison for the Israelis in the absence of the Turks while attaining for itself more leverage as an international arbiter and, for those who subscribe to the idea of a Muslim collective, a strong spokesman for the Muslim world.

I believe each of us goes through these stages of falling out of love with our works in progress. That doesn’t make it any easier to work through, but I’m seeing it as a learning curve. Previously I wrote novels in one month – that kitchen-sink approach left no time to get all bleh-bleh.
Before we go any further, a little explanation: I imagine it's like this at a lot of jobs, but when I started working at a comic book store three years ago, my good friends Chad--my boss at the time--and Scott were constantly dropping little bits of knowledge on me that aren't that widely known to the general public. Stories about creators and how certain comics came to be, hidden treasures of the back issues, stuff like that.

As I headed towards the city, I contemplated the options. So far, my plan was to drive into Arcania and tiptoe around the streets until I came across…well, a bad guy. I couldn’t hope that I’d find Fortune so easily, but I could use some practice on a teenage vandal spray-painting the walls or something.

This site offers the possibility of making a food chain on 3 different habitats. What is special about this site is that while making the food chain, students will apply the concept of food web, understanding that one animal can eat and be eaten by various other organisms. So, students will have to figure out how to enter the different members in their assigned space, depending on how the arrows show the relationship between them. Finally, there is a hint where a small chart that explains from where each member gets energy from.

VISUALS: The mirror theme is, obviously, a strong part of the visuals. The opening credits were awesome — consisting of mirror-image aerial shots of New York done in a very triptastic way. The film stock used had an insane amounts of lens flare / reflection — whenever Kiefer would wave his flashlight around, you’d see the reflection of the flashlight on the screen. I complained about this several times until Carolyn pointed out that it was so you would see the mirror reflection of the flashlight. Suddenly, what felt like a bug was now a feature.
To further complicate things(because nothing's ever simple or easy with me, as I'm sure you've noticed) nerve damage is exacerbated by a slew of other factors.

*Edit @ 21:30 : From talking about this advert even more with my boyfriend whilst he was driving me back home, I found it amusing that this little gizmo, or the ones that are mass marketed, use 8x 1.5V AAA batteries or a 12V plug-in adapter, and it’s used in an advert for an energy company.
