Here is my take on the challenge.
Perhaps the Rotary damper will be explored in F1 again at some point, but for now the Linear damper is the sole solution in F1.
Anyway, earlier this week, I noticed that flower buds were popping up on these “wild” chokes so when I got home, I checked on my little babies, i wasn’t expecting much as overall, my plants haven’t been that healthy. But lo and behold, here are my own homegrown little chokes peeping out!
of unnecessary questions about my post. -_-
In a single moment, you crossed the line from the healthy life you knew and passed into the “world of the disabled.” You had peace of mind before— but now there’s only anxiety and fear.
I recently observed a little girl approach her leader at a party and ask if she qualified for a particular badge. The leader clearly wanted the child to bleed before she’d give up a badge that easily. The national group might disband. The entire structure of the U.S. could fail if a little girl got an undeserved badge for Knitting.

Um...okay...so how is it Drakar is sitting there with the Society anyway? What's this deal? If I had fingernails I'd bite them :-)
They say it will have prayer facilities, but will not be a mosque.
Spending is what the present-day government exists to do. It is why millions are spent on races for the White House and seats in Congress. It is why some enter the Capitol with modest means and leave as multi-millionaires.
Alright, I’ll admit to the stupidest thing I ever did in a race. It happened just last spring at the Boston University Road Race.
I was beginning to wonder by now if I was going mad. I mean OF COURSE I had my own bank card. There may never be any money to spend, but I guard my bank cards like the crown jewels. After all, you never know who might want to spend your overdraft for you, and you wouldn't want them getting up to the limit before you do would you?
“And what exactly would that be?” Arianna questioned with annoyance from her precarious position on the armchair.
I understand 'The Gunfighters' has the remarkable honour of being the first western ever made in Britain. This is probably not surprising as it makes a lot of sense to leave the Yanks to do what they are good at. By the time The Gunfighters was made, the public were getting a little tired of westerns and so the story opts to send up the genre. Hence, we are treated to some hilarious comedy. I think it is much more successful as a comedy story than The Romans, which was a little too daft in places, while in other places being very grim and quite serious.
3. Literactive: This is one of those websites you will either love or hate. It’s free to register and you can ask to register with UK English (the site is American). I just found that the Road to Reading section had some really useful sequencing and memory based activities that some pupils with SEN found both engaging and enjoyable. It is pitched at a young audience but the animated content in the sequencing activities and some of the more cartoony elements mean that you could use it with some slightly older pupils if you needed to.
Finally, after you've asked all those questions, ask yourself this: isn't it time you wrote your legislator and told them that they should support Mike Turzai's bill to abolish the State Store System?
Her thinking was clear: surely this long line of friendly motorists wouldn’t mind while she took her time in crossing? After all, what’s the hurry? Who would begrudge Mum with her pram and a little one, too? And if the little one dropped his Bunnie and burst into tears and Mum had to set the pram on the brakes and do a comedy trot, remarkable for its tardy inefficiency, back to pick up Bunnie and squander a few seconds in comfort and reassurance, root around in her too-tight trews for a grubby hanky, well, who’s to mind?
Even (then ANC president) Oliver Tambo was forced to comment, when he visited the place for the first time in August 1987, that the cells were too dark and suffocating.
People are quick to act out of passion. Logic and actual need catch up to them in a lousy sobering way, and by then it’s usually too late to make amends. Sometimes it’s not; usually it is. We have memories for every little hurt and every little transgression–like elephants we retain everything, we humans–but only when it suits us, or fits our purposes of justification. That same memory can weigh as heavily as an elephant sitting on your chest when you’re lonely. It’s like this great cerebral pachyderm phantasm that manifests itself at two a.m. in the gloom, in the silence, sitting on your chest making you labor every breath until you scream, like a child at the bottom of a dog-pile–”GET OFF!!–Goddammit–get the fuck off of me. YOU’RE CRUSHING ME!”

Bearing in mind the focus on phone hacking, illegal investigative techniques and alleged payments to police officers, we are able, I think, to leave out of consideration as regards alleged perjury much of Mr Wight’s evidence where these matters were not raised. Unless News International have presented the police with clear proof re these extraneous matters, it is highly unlikely they form the basis for the present investigation.
It’s fair to say that I spend as much time in San Francisco’s historic Chinatown as I do in North Beach — my pharmacy and my doctor are in Chinatown and many of the discount stores that we patronize for household goods are also on Grant or Stockton Avenue or somewhere in between. I also frequent the grand Chinatown Branch Library when the North Beach Branch doesn’t have what I’m looking for (which is fairly often but the journey there requires a steep uphill walk of four blocks and several ounces of patience since Chinese, when casually strolling the sidewalks, are notoriously oblivious to their surroundings and difficult, at best, to navigate around when one is in a hurry).
So in that sense, my drop-dead date is December 19th.

Instinctively she moved towards the first small hut, searching for any clue as to where she was and what had caused the fire, but the toxic atmosphere made her cough and her eyes wouldn’t stay open. Then her eyes spied a heap lying on the floor and a flash of blue held her focus, as her eyes zoomed in on the object, realization hit it was a small teddy bear. This time her scream vibrated around the empty ghost town, she didn’t stop until she felt a small hand squeeze hers. She gazed down at the child that stood there and her whole body froze. Her features were tiny and perfect, big dark eyes and a small button nose with soft pink lips. She was beautiful.

The argument the Death Penalty deters homicide is pure myth. Before criminals go out and pull the trigger, they do not visit the local library to research which states impose the Death Penalty, versus those that do not. They are generally not that rational. Even those who are aware of the possible punishments are not deterred, because crimes are usually committed on impulse, by people who are simply not thinking straight at the moment. The recent killing of the black boy in Florida is a good example.

If you don’t understand this, or you doubt my word, don’t even both reading any further. This blog will only upset you. I chop up from 1/2 to 1 canned chipotle pepper and stir it into some yogurt, and ta-dah! A delicious, spicy, smokey dip is ready. It’s that easy.

‘And hey, why don’t we get real about this? Most rich folks paying 28 percent taxes do not give out another 28 percent of their income to charity. Most rich folks like to keep their dough. They don’t strip their bank accounts and investment portfolios, they keep them and then pass them on to their children, their children’s children. And what they do give away is—like the monies my wife and I donate—totally at their own discretion. That’s the rich-guy philosophy in a nutshell: Don’t tell us how to use our money; we’ll tell you’.

Over the years online dating sites have evolved significantly and their numbers grow on a daily basis. As a result many websites have started posting lists of online dating tips. Every day there are hundreds of success stories about people finding their soul mates online at matchmaking and dating sites. The idea of meeting a soul mate online is no longer a “taboo” or “funny topic” in conversations. The success stories from online dating sites have skyrocketed in recent years due to ever evolving online matchmaking technology and the boost in interest in social networks, like Facebook. But now meeting your soul mate online is all the buzz.

There is obviously a crisis in retail at the moment, but I find that very exciting. In the early 2000s, Adjaye Associates was commissioned by Tower Hamlets in east London to rethink two of their public libraries: in Poplar and on Whitechapel High Street. The big complaint about the old libraries was that they were not connected to the economic activity of people. They functioned best when they right there and convenient, and became remote and less desirable when they were away from that.

I am excited to be learning these skills; however, at one point during the day, I felt as if my brain was going to burst because of how fast we are going thru all this.

The thinking behind the study at Ohio State is rather muddled, and not very scientific from what I can discern. How can so much be divined from this one study? First of all, the study assumes that because the subjects behaved in a certain way after listening to certain music, the music must have caused the behavior.
FA: For me, nothing. I don’t think it’s a big factor. We saw one McLaren fighting for the podium until the last moment. We saw Red Bull, Ferrari for the other positions on the podium and, as we saw 15 days ago in Valencia, I was second. I didn’t see any Force India or any Sauber or anything fighting for victory because the rules changed. It was more or less the same.

Oh dear me. She started wailing, screaming, and then crying. I lay beside her as she kicked about. Then I hugged her. She protested and pushed away. I persisted. Hugging firmly but letting her go if she wanted. Then when I knew holding her up would not quieten her as it normally does, I picked her up and sat back against a couple of pillows. She sat on my lap sideways. And she cried.

First time I heard about this movie I wasn’t really on board, all I got of the plot description was five friends go to a cabin in the woods and bad stuff happens. Sounds like a pretty standard horror film. Add to that a script by Joss Whedon and I was wary. It’s not that I hate his work but sometimes the Whedon fanboys/girls are a little over zealous with how they sell his creative pursuits. All that was put to rest when I saw the trailer, looks like there is something interesting happening with the movie as it tries to subvert expectations.

So when it came to celebrating with my valentine ... it was a normal Tuesday. We did a normal workout (P90X2 is getting intense, y'all) and I made a normal dinner - this soup. I decided to make our meal somewhat special and throw what little festive energy I had into making some quick bread (Parathas). That's right - we celebrated Valentine's Day with gluten. We watched 30 Rock and I fought with Dinahsaur for space next to Jeremy on the couch. I decided to get in the Love Day mood with strawberries (the most romantic fruit ever, right?) and coconut cream with cinnamon - and a couple glasses of Shiraz. And just when I thought this Tuesday might cross over into Valentine's Day territory (frisky hands aren't just for TSA costumes on Halloween) I became sleepy. And bloated. I knew I shouldn't have had that gluten. And that's where the story of our normal Tuesday that happened to be on Valentine's Day concludes. I crawl in bed and fall fast asleep. End scene.

But the 1820s were not a welcoming era for Catholics in the United States, and a young Catholic Church in Manhattan, dedicated in 1818 for St. Patrick, bore the brunt of New York anti-Irish, anti-Catholic sentiment in its early years. Although its ornate, showier successor opened in 1879, St. Patrick's Old Cathedral has weathered on. Its distinction as a basilica just underscores its value as one of New York's most important historical structures still standing.

The upside was I got to meet Jeremy Paxman, who lived next to the field we were filming in. He was a jolly nice chap with his lovely kids and a wheezy old retriever following him dolefully about. He was very interested in our filming and recognised me from my appearances on the BBC as Kirky. This made me incredibly proud and I puffed out my chest somewhat. Compliments from Paxman, one imagines, do not come that often.

At a college fraternity New Year's Eve party, Alana Maxwell (JLC) is lightly coerced into participating in a hilarious prank that any rationally human being can see is bloody stupid idea from the outset. Instead of saying that this is bloody stupid and telling the wacky japesters to bugger off, Alana instead climbs onboard the stupid wagon and lures the shy and awkward butt of the prank Kenny Hampson into a darkened room with the promise of sex. Really Kenny should have known that this was going to end badly so partially he really did deserve to find a woman’s corpse in the bed rather than the promised Jamie Lee. Understandably traumatised by this turn of events Kenny winds up in a psychiatric hospital.

5) Real progress, not just pledges. We've seen a massive shift in this area in the last five years. It's now more of a governmental problem than a big corporate one. Nevertheless, it's linked with the transparency and humility points above in that companies will still seek to make more out of promises than they do out of why they've not succeeded (i.e. using the line 'tell us how to do it better' for ideas as to how they can improve).

I am also reminded of when I started eating gluten-free 5 years ago in January 2007, and that anniversary to me is a symbol of how each year can be started out with a fresh start. A new life. A fresh start for a healthier you. Writing out your goals and dreams can help you make things happen (similar to a vision board). Yes, you have your struggles throughout the year, but it is nice to have something to shoot for and look back upon. It is also nice to look back on your dreams from the year before and see how far you have come. Or notice some reoccurring thoughts that maybe need more time or space to develop and explore in yourself.

And sometimes, nights that sound like they might be fun, just fall into place perfectly and are so. stinkin'. fun.
I had a conversation with one of my Twitter friends, who said he's a minimalist when using commas. When I read a sample of one of his books, the absence of commas before names in direct speech irritated me, so much, that I'm confident I wouldn't be able to read one of his books. Nothing to do with the quality, but I just hate this particular comma not being where it belongs. I know you can see from the sentence if it needs a comma or not. (Age old: 'Let's eat grandma' vs. 'Let's eat, grandma'), but if you use it in one case and not so in another, it would make an inconsistent use. To me, that is. But what if other readers think the same? Is it really worth it to compromise this little comma?
Ahmed Fouad Pasha was born on 26th March 1868 in the Giza Palace, Cairo. He was the seventh son of the newly installed Khedive of Egypt, Isma'il Pasha. The Khedivate of Egypt ended when the United Kingdom declared a Protectorate over the country, then nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire. The British deposed Khedive Abbas Hilmi II and installed his uncle, Hussein Kamel, as Sultan. Following his death in October 1917, he was succeeded by his brother Fouad.

I also read there is a shortage of plus-sized underwear at women’s shelters. Further research says that skid marks or bloodstains are not okay. Holes are also not preferred. No one is interested in unsightly knickers.
The health, well-being and safety of our people ALWAYS take priority over stupid immature childish dreams and ideals. There is little that could cause me to explode as heavily as the bullshit spluttered by ignorant irresponsible leaders about their dreams and ideals without considering the immediate threats to their followers, our own people, because the damn leaders have no vision, no insight, no sense of priority, no sense of responsibility, because they themselves have lost all sense of reality. The leaders themselves are so stuck in their make-believe dreams that they have lost all perspective.

the case did "not fit within one of the exceptions to the basic rule that when the indirect infringer does not cause the original infringement but merely prolongs an infringing use of a product by providing supplies or spare parts." See also, e.g., Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.S. 476, 508 (1964) ("Aro II") (noting that, in a proper case against a contributor infringer that prolongs use of an infringing product, a patent owner might be able to obtain an injunction; recover damages based on the prolongation of the use; obtain punitive or increased damages for willful or bad-faith infringement; and perhaps damages primarily caused by the direct infringer when those damages could not be recovered from the direct infringer); King Instrument Corp. v. Otari Corp., 814 F.2d 1560, 1563-64 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (authorizing separate proceedings to resolve the appropriate amount of damages for (1) infringing sales of machines and (2) potential indirect infringement in the form of sales of spare parts, including spare parts used for reconstruction to extend the useful life of the machines and spare parts associated with new machine sales for which the patentee had not already been compensated)

What would it take to convince liberals that everybody is not responsible for the lives of everybody else? At what point will they understand that there is a significant place in society for individual responsibility?
In my post While we’re on the subject I talked about the difference between limiting and constricting knowledge into discrete “subjects” vs. accepting the reality that all knowledge and information is connected – somehow. Granted, the connection might be tenuous, to you, at this particular time, but at some other time, in some other circumstance, to someone else, it might be quite closely connected. Early in that post I referenced Eratosthenes and his ingenious – and simple – method for calculating the circumference of the earth 2200 years ago, with none of the resources we have today. Remembering Eratosthenes reminded me of another brilliant man whose life overlapped my own, rather than being from two millennia earlier, Enrico Fermi. If you’re not specifically familiar with him, you may recognize his name from the element named after him, fermium (Fm - element 100), or the fermion of quantum physics.

Strangely there were no postcards nor anything from the museum as a memento of Drais’ bike legacy. Later I noticed a token touristy Drais’ image on a mug at the Majorca Ceramic Museum. (A fabulous place to visit.)
Here's my advice on that--make connections with people who seem to be on a similar path and take those relationships outside of the content mill community. Email or chat via messenger. Networking is an important component of a successful writing career, and there's nothing saying you can't find decent writers in content mill communities.
The book narrates the story of police inspector Sartaj Singh and underworld mafia and through them the writer has brought in a picture of contemporary India, its politics, working of police and intelligence agencies, connections between police, Bollywood and underworld, religious terrorism, nuclear threats and how this all affects day-to-day life of common people. The book is also about dreams of common people who may get into underworld or police or Bollywood and how they fight for their aspirations.
The pilot has kindly agreed to answer any and all questions you have about all things aviation...or anything else for that matter.
And that's something else: for a director and visualiser like Bakshi to create figures that are so plain and dull, so poorly conceptualized and so sloppily executed is not in keeping with the more solid, substantial elements onscreen. Meaning? Not only do the cartoon characters occupy their space like a hastily-drawn sketch or pre-production concept instead of finished product, they have no importance as to what they're supposed to be.
To make things right Dr. Ritter marries Lily after all the surgeries are completed, and he is one happy camper, except at this point, a minion of olde adages apply, like beauty is only skin deep, or you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink, or as Bo Diddley would so succinctly announce, you can't judge a book by lookin' at the cover!!!
The results after taking the program will take few days and relief will be coming once the program has started. The other benefit of trying out this program is that it is refundable. One can try this product for 8weeks and if no improvement is seen then a full refund comes back to the customer or patient suffering from tinnitus.
His assertion is about the Nazis, not about Israel. He goes on to reflect, accurately, that because of the Jews' genocide, Israel prioritizes security over a fair treatment of the Palestinians, and adds:
The past few weeks have been a whirlwind. Every weekend I've embarked on a new adventure...zip lining, horseback riding, random beach trips and even a New York family visit. All of which has made it THAT much harder to return to work on Mondays.

If you haven’t taken the time to draft one of these one-seam skirts, do yourself a favor and set aside 30 minutes to do so. This is an elastic-waist skirt with deep side seam darts with additional darts front and back for shaping and works very well in knits. The darts take away the extra bulk around the elastic waist. Once drafted, you can have yourself a skirt in an hour, start to finish.
So I hope everyone had a nice day and if you are going shopping you find all the deals you are looking for.

I returned (slightly dazed) to Space 2 and caught the end of Barn Owl, who was doing a shrieky guitar drone. It was another one of those where I couldn’t get much from it and probably needed to have seen what led up to that point.
Face the facts kid, you are a loser who doesn't deserve to even stand in the shadow of some of these people. A guy who is being left behind in the dust in the game with very little chance of catching back up at this point. You have no skills, no money and no life. Maybe if you accept that fact and try to do something real with your life, you could at least get a job at Burger King or something. Stop trying to be something your not.

Kaleth mentioned that this might spell the end, and they should perhaps give up and go home. Merrick eyed the windows above, but Thorn held him back. He found a long piece of masonry to use as a battering ram and I know it is unbelieavable, but he too rolled a natural 1 on his athletics check (three in a row!) and the masonry became lodged in the door. Now they truly were thwarted by this legendary door.

I bet you thought I was going to comment on Rebbecca Black and her annoyingly awful youtube sensation Friday. Well I am not because I do not believe giving her anymore power and celeb status is appropriate. That is all I will say on that subject. As for the title of this blog, well tomorrow is Friday and there has been a common theme on the Friday's that I work, one that I am none to thrilled about. There are not many hazards of being in the bar industry, we get to take off work when we want, we make more in a weekend than a lot of people make in 2 weeks, we get to have fun and drink while we work, there is always a constant dance party and playlist, and you get to meet and see some pretty interesting people. However this one hazard seems to creep up on you when you least expect it.
It wasn't always like this. For much of the past century, "minorities were either invisible in mainstream media, or handed negative roles that generally had them in a subservient position," says Jerome Williams, a professor of advertising and African-American studies at the University of Texas at Austin.''

All those normal pieces of her life were stolen from her the night her family was murdered. Shocking revelation, simply stated. Gets the facts out clearly and concisely, and sets up a big part of the plot. This has all happened in just four sentences. A lot of information in a brief pitch. Brevity is good.
Sharia heard the captain mumble something under his breath as he came closer. Then his blade whisked out and struck the statue, first a tap on the chest then a scratch on the leg. She saw its edge dig a groove in the rock salt, and knew her chance had come. She leapt.

He and Tina both swore that these conversations were innocent. She was a married woman, after all. They were simply catching up and talking about how crazy it was that her sister ultimately married his brother. And don’t you know that takes eight months to talk about? Tina admitted she hadn’t told her husband she was back in touch with my ex fiancé, but that was because it was innocent. “If it is innocent, why would you keep it a secret from your husband?” I asked. She didn’t have a good answer.

GE which traded in Ireland as GE Money Ireland and was officially known as GE Capital Woodchester Home Loans Limited; it was one of a number of so-called “sub-prime lenders” that did brisk business in Ireland during the 2000s. Sub-prime lenders attracted customers who mightn’t have been able to obtain mortgages elsewhere and charged a handsome premium for doing business with these borrowers. These borrowers were hardest hit in the subsequent collapse of the property sector and faced with spiraling unemployment, declining wages and rent levels and negative equity, these borrowers have particularly been placed in difficult positions – take a look at court records for 2010 and you’ll see about 80 applications where GE is seemingly chasing repayment. According to GE, the Irish mortgage loan-book is “the most challenged mortgage book” the company has, and remember GE lends into such markets as Nevada and Florida in the US and Spain, Italy, Greece in the EU.

But verbal and emotional abuse is tricky. It's a sly thing that hides from the world. It can even hide from the victim; you just can't put your finger on it. Especially if you grew up with it. Which we both did, to some extent. And it comes on a little at a time so you don't notice it growing. When you've lived it you believe it is normal. You believe that everyone gets to that point at one time or another, behind closed doors. Because it's all you've ever known.
On my last post, aurora commented that she didn't know how Max and I got paired up. Actually, I totally lucked out - he is the best!
For this project, I made sure I ironed my seams outwards so that I could use the shadow of the 1/4" seam allowance as a guide. That way, I didn't have to mark my quilt or use quilters tape as a guide.
Additionally, the speed at which all these processes occur depends sensitively on their mass, with huge stars using up their fuel quite quickly (a few million years), while very small stars can burn for 100 billion years. It's a bit similar to celebrities - superstars like Britney Spears shine brightly but quickly burn out, while minor stars such as Foghat are still touring to this day.

Although David is inspired primarily by fantasy fiction, he also finds his muse in the form of anime, world cinema, history, and biographies. His own books, Fezariu's Epiphany and the in-progress A World Apart, combine aspects from worlds both old and new into compelling tales of a world not soon forgotten., David himself certainly does not lack a spirit of adventure; in fact, he left his job in 2007 in order to spend a month traveling. Second only to meeting and marrying his wife, David counts this as one of the most amazing experiences of his life.

The path on the left is a lot different. An archway of dull bare tree limbs, making the path look like a prison. It's dark, and the path itself is full of weeds poking through brick. There is no sound, except for a cricket and maybe a growl, which is kinda scary. Wait. I hear a wolf howling too. The sign above the path is worn and the edges of the wood is stained with mold. It reads--Rejection.
Each of these has two modes:
See, in my humble opinion this is what is wrong with this country. Why the hell are we worrying about something that happened hundreds of years ago? Why are we not worrying about the fact that the economy is in the shitter? Or that there is still homeless and starving children in this day and age? Get a hobby. Get a job. Focus your energy where you can do some good.

While half the team is at the bowling alley, the other half gathers at April and Andy’s house where they’ll be cold-calling for campaign donations all evening. Chris is as enthusiastic as ever and is even more overjoyed when Jerry puts up two movie passes as the prize for whoever raises the most money. April becomes annoyed with Chris’s cheerfulness and decides she wants to make his “happiness go away,” so her competitive streak comes out to try and beat Chris.
suggested that Jim tell Tomas about the predicament of his work in the US. Although he was receiving attention for his poetry, it was apparently the “wrong kind” of attention, allaying him with the conservative visions of Bly’s “Deep Image,” instead of the more radical imagism that seemed to be in the work itself, writing closer to Jerome Rothenberg's and Robert Kelly's original, more radical notion of "deep image."

I siezed the opportunity to welcome little Arvid into this world. He was actually born about five months ago but for some reason the post office has been "unable" to deliver my packages...they just don´t seem to turn up at my friends house. The first parcel just vanished?? Hm? The second one came back to me again...so I figured I should make a third little gift set and that will be deliverd for sure, right? I mean hard hard can it be? :o
It took no time at all to stain the pieces. Yes, I said pieces. I stained it PRIOR to putting it together as I wanted the inside of the drawers to be stained as well.
After La Fortuna, I had one more stop inland and headed for the Monteverde Cloud Forest. The trip between La Fortuna and Santa Elena was incredible. First a boat ride across Lago Arenal followed by a short bus ride through the rolling hills. And what would a rest stop be if you couldn’t play with the local pet parrot??
“When I went back in the compound, away from the public, of course, I were a nobody. Mama’s Little Children and The Troggs were doing the gig for free – cos we weren’t famous.

I was wondering how similar TAB would be to Diet Coke, but to me.. it resembles Coke Zero which I also like. I've had some terrible diet sodas in my time, but TAB is a refreshing, smooth, and tasty soda, that is enjoyable to drink. Throw in the retro angle of the cool pink can, and seventies looking logo, and I was glad that I bought this 12 pack.
As well as the indecent haste of all this, it now transpires that the chambermaid has gone into hiding. Her lawyer Jeffrey Shapiro said she was an immigrant from the West African nation of Guinea. She arrived in the US seven years ago and was living with her teenage daughter. What we don’t know is who has arranged for her to ‘go into hiding’. But Shapiro adds that his client “had no idea who her attacker was before the police were called in”.

Jay Spearing has unfortunately proven that he isn’t of the standard expected at Anfield. He does not command the midfield from deep positions or adequately protect his defence. Indeed, other than Steven Gerrard, who is now well in his thirties, Liverpool could do with completely renovating its midfield over the summer.

If the sanctity of life is the highest value in a civilized society, then the New South Africa has little to recommend it. Societies are only as good as the individuals of whom they are comprised; individuals only as good as their actions. Democratic South Africa is now preponderantly overrun by elements, both within and without government, which make a safe and thriving civil society impossible to sustain. The salient feature of mass politics in the New South Africa is a government unable to control itself and unwilling to control a sinecured criminal class. As a consequence, sundered is the individual’s right to live unmolested.

Chelsea Fetch and I had our first F2F with our nonprofit: Cat’s Cradle, a no-kill cat shelter. Gail and Carol are the two ladies that run the shelter. Both are very dedicated to the work of caring for unwanted cats and finding them a safe home. Without their shelter, many of these cats would be euthanized or forgotten. Corky, for example, is a cat whose back legs are backwards. According to Gail, this is a deformity caused by inbreeding. When most people are seeking a pet, they reject anything that doesn’t fit their perfect ideals. So poor cats like Corky get left behind. Cat’s Cradle is different: it takes in the unwanted, the rejected, the sick, the lost.
Like cereal. I became an oatmeal girl for the last 3 or so years after 3 years of daily cereal-with-banana-on-top-breakfasts. Ever since I have only had cereal a handful of times. Until this past week. I don’t think I will convert back, but there is just something so comforting about a huge bowl of hearty cereal with a banana sliced up on top, drowning in So Good soy. Takes me back to my childhood . . . or maybe exams just bring out the worst in me.

My grandmother always told the story of how my first words were the names of the plants in her garden. Was my love of plants instilled in me at a young age or just inherent in my nature? I just know the lack of green growing things sucks my soul dry.
When is an electronic communication published? From Martin Kirk (a senior patent attorney in the DSM Expert Centre, Urmond) comes news of some fascinating European Patent Office determinations regarding the legal status of email messages that have been transmitted via the internet: do they constitute public disclosures or not? In short, the EPO's Technical Board of Appeal (TBA) has held that emails sent via internet are not deemed public (T 0002/09) -- but there is now a new test to assess in practical terms whether documents that have been uploaded to the web are deemed public (T 1553/06). Martin, who was involved in these decisions, explains as follows:

‘Money can buy you everything in IPL but not Pakistani players’ could have been the apt phrase for the IPL 5 auctions, as there was not a single player from Pakistan in the list of players who were to be auctioned. The ongoing IPL has been missing out on the best T20 players from Pakistan. Pakistan Cricketers were in huge demand in the KFC T20 league in Australia, and most of the players impressed all and sundry. The IPL franchises would have been pleased, if they had an option of buying players such as Afridi, Salman Butt, Umar Gul, the Akmal brothers, just to name a few.

All humans have imbedded in them the ability to choose a mate. But this ability is hindered by conscious thought. Compare this line of reasoning to how a few species of animals reproduce. Chickens, to use the example laid down by my good friend Molly Midori, are such a simple minded creature we almost wish (and hope) that they were smarter just so we are justified in saying that everything in the world tastes like them. However, in wooing a mate, a rooster just has to lower a wing and dance and: Score! If a single rooster is cooped up with a hundred hens, he’s got a busy day. Cats, deer, and many other species, on the other hand, are much more complex, but still much simpler than humans. A male of these species only need to wait for mating season when all the females go into heat and then compete with masculine fervor to woo the closest female. This is based on a seasonal or yearly cycle, so if a male doesn’t do his “dance” right, he could find himself having to wait a whole year.

On Saturday, May 12, we hosted the first Read Local event at Velma Teague. You've heard of the campaigns to shop local and eat local. We invited authors from Glendale and the Valley to appear at the library to discuss and sign their small-press and self-published books. Seven authors appeared. They each had five minutes to pitch their books. Afterward, they took questions and sold and signed their books.

Those are the words of Amrish Puri’s character, Kishorilal, the typical NRI rich industrialist living in Ameerika who travels back to Hindustan to keep in touch with his roots and meet with childhood friends, like Alok Nath’s Suraj Dev.

James wants to apologize to his family, friends, and to all the fans, because he feels he let us down since he didn’t win the World Heavyweight Title. He said that because he felt like he was going to win. He was trying to hurt Bobby, and that was his big mistake, his pride and ego. He thought when he saw the trainers, he was satisfied. Then he got to the back, and he doubted if that truly was enough. Then when he got back home, and tucked his little daughter into bed, she said “Daddy, where is that title, she wants to look at it”, it took so much for James to tell her he didn’t win it. And any parent knows that you never want to tell your kids that you have been a failure. He couldn’t look at himself in the eyes, because he couldn’t deal with the loss. When he woke up the next morning, he saw himself in the mirror and saw a man who was beaten. Bobby, you may have won the match, but you did not beat him. James beat himself. 15 years, he has wrestled with broken bones, surgeries, concussions, but why did he do it? Because the fans would chant his name, and this is his piece of heaven. He thanks the crowd for having this life, but the only person he wanted to thank, but he let him down was his Father, who is in Heaven, still proud of “Cowboy”. This is what he loves, or so he thought, because Bobby Roode said something to him that stuck to his head, about his luck. Maybe he is right, maybe Storm’s luck has run out?
UPDATE: 18th April, 2011. David McWilliams has come out in favour of lower rents, though he doesn’t go so far as to support banning Upward Only Rent Reviews. John McManus delivers a barely literate and partly inaccurate article in support of changes to UORRs in the Irish Times. He incorrectly claims that the recent Central Bank of Ireland stress tests did not consider the abolition of UORRs when the explicit change projected in the adverse scenario was 20% different to the baseline scenario specifically to accommodate the expected 20% drop which the SCSI has said would follow the abolition of UORRs. The article focusses on improving competition by setting rents at market levels.

The situation is dire. The Muslim fanatic chased from his own Muzland finds refuge in England to preach the enslavement and mass murder of Anglicans while receiving lavish welfare from Anglican taxpayers and vocal support from the Anglican Primate and bishops. If that’s not crazy, what is? And the Muslim is not the crazy one.
Taetiseo’s mini album ‘Twinkle‘ has been at the #1 spot for Tower Record‘s pre-sales rankings for 3 straight days in a row, and ranked #2 on the daily chart. Also, on HMV‘s pre-sales ranking chart, Taetiseo comes in at #4, revealing Japanese fans’ immense interest in the trio. The Japanese media, such as Inno Life, are reporting, “It’s enough with even just 3 members. International fans’ interest in Girls’ Generation’s Taetiseo is huge.”

Then, the biggest hill of the race. Practically a 90-degree angle, for heaven's sake. We had already decided we would walk up the hill, then run down and finish the last three miles. My knee, however, had other plans. Despite the support brace I was wearing to prevent this sort of injury, that last hill did me in. I had to urge the other girls to keep going while I walked it out, hoping to run again after a few minutes.

The message was to David, who at that time was the King of Israel;

The Casio WVA430J solar watch is in true sense the watch of this century. Few years back you could have never imagined such a thing, in fact it was out of question. Hence by looking at this watch, it has been proved that technology has gone very far and nothing is impossible in today’s world. You should just have the dedication and commitment to achieve your goal and you should have a clear focus as well, nobody can then stop you from reaching great heights.
That being said, I bring you interesting news about what’s to come in the near future (when I get my computer back from the computer repair guys). I’ve decided to combine The Infinite Vertices with my LGBTQIA blog “The Soyez Vous-même Blog.” The transition should begin as soon as I get my computer back (sometime next week). What this means is that The Infinite Vertices will still be here, but I will only be posting new posts on The Soyez Vous-même Blog (again: after I get my computer back).

If you are a mother, I hope you have had a wonderful Mother's Day! I definitely have! After getting to sleep in, I was awoken by William and the boys bringing me breakfast in bed! They had picked me flowers and made me a card and breakfast and brought it all to me on a silver platter. It was so sweet. My card said that they had given a gift in my honor of 12 baby chicks to someone in need. Through a program called Samaritan's Purse, you can donate different animals or money to people who are hurting. The chicks will grow up to provide eggs and more chickens for someone. That gift was way better than any thing that that they could have given me!

I think you can fall out of romantic love. It’s possible to stop liking someone, for your personalities to change so that you don’t get along anymore, or even to be upset because of something they did to you. But to treat someone with deliberate contempt whom you’ve claimed to love — there’s something wrong there.
This two-part TV miniseries by the famous (and famously prolific) German director—an adaptation of Daniel F. Galouye's influential novel Simulacron-3—was first broadcast in Germany in 1973 and maybe screened only once in the U.S. until last month, when it played a widely publicized week-long run at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. That's where I saw the film—at least, after waiting on a rush line for an hour and hoping and praying I wasn't too far back in the line to be turned away. Boy, am I so glad I was not! What an endlessly inventive and intellectually stimulating film this is: the kind of great science fiction that momentarily makes you wonder about the world around you—what's real, what's a simulacrum, and the like—while not shortchanging visual and human interest.

One of the best things that the government could do (perhaps APPG could help here?) would be to find some money to fund a campaign that informs doctors and medical schools about what ME really is and how severely it affects people. What is to be gained by the government's recognition of ME as a neurological condition, if the NHS, benefits agencies and medical insurance companies do not also accept this classification? We believe there are many reasons for this ignorance but if we could counter some of the misinformation, patients at least may receive a less hostile reception when they do seek help.

During the surgery the guy codes on the table. April, who’s working with Callie on the hand, is right there when Cardio is paged. Cristina who arrives first, tells April to start the procedure because she needs to get dressed. When Teddy arrives April is doing the surgery under supervision of Cristina. Teddy is surprised and asks Cristina why she isn’t the one who’s cutting. She is confused: If she cuts she’s in trouble, if she doesn’t she’s in trouble. Teddy tells Cristina to make a list Cristina needs to make a list of all the surgeries she wants to perform and Teddy will see if she can get them for her because what she witnessed in that OR was exactly what she wanted. Cristina is good, there is no denying that, but she would have fought to do that surgery just a couple of weeks ago and now she allowed April to do it. April, the girl she doesn’t even like. Teddy tells her that she put the patient before herself even though she is still just as brilliant as she always was.
Fortunately, in spite of the design of Hid set bulbs, they are very uncomplicated to set up by a car owner. Similar to basic halogen bulbs, the bulb is simply inserted into the headlight cavity. There is even more complication in routine bulb installation due to the method different vehicle fronts are designed than certain handling of a Hid bulb. Nonetheless, it is necessary not to ever before touch the glass of the Hid bulb. Any kind of fingerprint oil will certainly create a hot spot promptly on the bulb, inducing it to fail prematurely. If, by mishap, the Hid bulb is touched, then it ought to be cleaned promptly with basic rubbing alcohol. That will at least take out many of the hot spot potential.

Certainly, the threats are out there, but there are simple steps that you can take to avoid some of the germs that are prevalent in the gyms. The first up should be common sense in that you wash your gym clothes after each workout. The days of the filthy socks, stinky sweatshirts, and dirty gym shoes are long past. These are simply an invitation for health problems to pop up in your life.
Also, increased gas prices allow you to give an excuse to why you can’t make it to that person you secretly hate’s birthday party/wedding/get-together. “Sorry Billy, I can’t make the quarter-mile hike to your house because the gas prices are just too high. Do me a favor and say fuck you to the kids and wife because I hate you and your stupid face.” Oh that would be splendid wouldn’t it? Also, it decreases the chances of your bum uncle coming to your house and threatening to shit on your porch if you don’t give him money for crack.
He won for the fifth consecutive year, in 6.59sec, to boost his confidence before another busy winter and spring, including a race in Karlsruhe, Germany, today. This time, however, the final destination is different. Instead of aiming for the big championships of the winter – which this year is the world indoor championships in Moscow – Gardener’s sights are set on the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in March, where he will be hoping to at last win an individual medal in a major 100m. It is the quality of the field in Melbourne, where six of the world’s top 10, including world record holder Asafa Powell, from Jamaica, are eligible to compete, that has persuaded Gardener that he cannot afford to take the risk of doing the two events, which are only five days apart.

Campbell knows how to mix his close-ups and long-shots to make action scenes really pop. Shooting the tank chase scene and the one-on-one fisticuffs between 007 and 006 require different techniques and Campbell delivers on both accounts. The tank chase constantly shifts from close to long, from facial shots to spinning wheels, while constantly letting you feel the power at play and appreciate the coolness of it all.

For the first time, I understood why learning was somewhat easy for me. Why I didn’t have to study as much as others, why I wasn’t fearful of testing. I was a smart girl. The week I returned to high school following testing week, my English teacher had changed my seat in her classroom. I was moved into the first row, into the third seat behind two caucasian girls, and in front of Debbie, another Black student. For the rest of our school years, dependant on our english testing scores and reports, Debbie and I would be shifted accordingly by the veteran english teacher who placed you in her classroom by unit grades. Later, in the 12th grade, I moved into the second seat of Row 1, behind Vivian Crouse. At graduation in 1970, Vivian was the valedictorian of our class. Over the course of time spent in D-1, the Black and white girls somehow determined that we were more alike than unlike. We grew to respect one another. We talked about the methods used for setting us apart by the so-called “educated” professionals in charge. Vivian, Tessie, Debbie, and I became outspoken advocates about prejudice, often voicing and questioning the behaviors we witnessed in the classroom we shared. Younger members of the faculty were more just, more equitable in their treatments of the student body. In my senior year, when Ms. G tried to box me into her list of Black authors for Black student’s choices for senior term paper subjects, I stood my ground once more as I insisted on selecting my author from the first listing she had passed earlier to the “other” students. She acquiesced and asked what writer I had chosen – “Louisa May Alcott”, I replied. I wrote about Little Women, my favorite book, and film. I earned an A+ on the paper, and Ms. G asked if she could keep it. I said “No”. Somehow, I just knew that she wanted to keep it as a souvenir, or a memento of the Black girl who managed to pass and exceed all of her qualification tests.

The answer lies in what happened at two Pakistani border posts 1.5 miles from the Afghan frontier in the early hours of November 26, 2011. NATO fighter aircraft and helicopters based in Afghanistan carried out a two-hour-long raid on these posts, killing 24 soldiers. Enraged, Pakistan’s government shut the two border crossings through which the US and NATO had until then sent a significant portion of their war supplies into Afghanistan. Its officials also forced the US to vacate Shamsi air base, which was being used by the CIA as a staging area for its drone air war in Pakistan’s tribal areas along the Afghan border. The drone strikes are exceedingly unpopular – one poll found 97 percent of respondents viewed them negatively—and they are vehemently condemned by a large section of the Pakistani public and its politicians.

Transparency and trust: As organizations pull out of the Great Recession, they may find their reputations as reliable employers permanently tarnished by layoffs and a slow return to hiring. Boomers may feel it is time to call in promises made against frozen wages and other concessions. Employers that articulate and demonstrate accountability to their promises will be the most likely to attract and retain talent.
Prophets communicated in a number of ways. There are several prophets mentioned in the Bible who do not have books in the Bible; look at Kings and Chronicles to see these “spoken prophets.” Other prophets wrote down their messages as well as speaking them; these are the prophets we see with books in the Bible. Prophets also often communicated through enacted symbols. Hosea was called to marry a harlot as a symbol of Israel’s unfaithfulness to God. Isaiah was called to walk around naked for three years as a sign against Egypt and Cush.

Jeep Safari Tour in Ladakh: Jeep Safari Tour in Ladakh tour is very beneficial especially when you will explore the icy fields of Ladakh. July to October are the best months to experience this kind of adventure and this tour involves you trekking around the Suru Valley, Zanskar and many more. Another great destination that this tour would lead you to is the Karsha that is an amazing and well celebrated monastery. This is really one pleasant experience for most passionate trekkers. Jeep Safari in Ladakh is perfect to be experienced with traveling families as well.
Then it was time for my first course: the chestnut-fennel veloute. Wikipedia tells me that a veloute is a type of French cream sauce, and I guess that makes sense, becuse this dish was a creamy soup (but it was not heavy; I don’t know how they managed that, but kudos). The chestnut-fennel flavors came through well and made the dish very satisfying. The dark pieces you see at the top are chocolate; the whitish cubes are marshmallows, and the red is a cherry. The chocolate and marshmallows were sweet, and the cherry was very tart. The contrast of flavors was great: I could have a creamy bite (just the soup); a sweet bite (soup + chocolate/marshmallow); a tart bite (soup + cherry); or some some combination. By the time I’d tried each combination a couple of times, the course was finished: the perfect amount.

It was also from this quote in which Neil’s next three albums (Time Fades Away, On The Beach, and Tonight’s The Night) were given the title of The Ditch Trilogy. In addition to this a few months after the death of Danny Whitten friend and roadie Bruce Berry passed away in a similar fashion. Young’s next release was the live album Time Fades Away that was released in 1973. This album was not like other live albums in many ways for one, it was a live album composed of previously unreleased material, which was unheard of at the time. Time Fades Away was recorded directly from the soundboard onto a 16 track Quad 8 CompuMix, which was the first digital mixing soundboard. This was done at the request of Young, producer David Briggs was strongly against this method. As a result of this unorthodox recording approach (a proper master tape was never made) the album features a muddy sounding mix. Time Fades Away was released on Vinyl, Cassette and 8 Track tape in October of 1973. Neil Young has been very outspoken as his dissatisfaction with this album. He has stated that it is his “worst release”, as a result Time Fades Away has never been released on CD. In 1995 a CD release was planned and test pressings were even made, but it was shelved and not released. Recently, it has been stated that it will be released on Neil Young’s second volume of his Archives Box Set along with Time Fades Away II. Young has been quoted from Guitar World in 2009 as saying about Time Fades Away II “It's a completely different thing, with completely different songs”

Well, that was the past, wasn’t it?

And you try not to think of all those wasted years in the darkness, because that only leads to Regret. And if Laziness is Fear’s bratty kid brother, then Regret is his sad-eyed spinster aunt.

"I'll take you shopping out of season, buy you summer clothes in the fall" Nose has a great chocolate, caramel and cherry. I think this one is a couple years old. The deep velvety brown beer has a nice soft dark cherry/malt flavor, followed up with some great light bitterness in the aftertaste. This beer seems to have aged nicely. I'm getting a more nutty flavor (no homo) as it warms up, something like almonds. Kinda like that poison in those Robert Ludlum novels. Hopefully I won't keel over here. If I do, it would be worth it. I'll go ahead and rate the aged Winter Stout at 4 Stars out of Five. Awesome.
Line up three shallow bowls on your work surface. Add flour to the first, the eggs to the second and the panko to the third. Beat the eggs to break them up.
Like their forefathers, they not only fail to protect women, but they put women in harm's way. Case in point: the Left's support for radical Islam, a culture tantamount to slavery for women. And a new generation of leftist women participate in their own destruction.

Crooked Stave - Chad brewed for Odell before starting his own brewery, currently located in the same building as Funkwerks. The two breweries share equipment, a bar for serving customers, and a love of Belgian style brewing. Crooked Stave is as new as new can be, they are yet to sell a single bottle of beer, but be sure to check them out if you are in the area. Chad is an expert on barrel-aged brewing and brewing with wild yeasts and he opened Crooked Stave to exercise these passions. This is a must for fans of sour beers.
The first phase of this wireless broadband project would involve its leasing around 26, 000 towers which have already attracted bids from varied tower operators. According to some sources, they have already set the ball rolling by looking out for quotes and samples for their carbon fire telecom towers from equipment vendors. With this change of plan, the outlay for their launch will double itself from the one previously settled on i.e. It may increase from $ 4 billion in 2010 to $ 8 -9 billion now.

The reason why I say I'm glad I'm not gay is not because I think gay is immoral, sinful, or void of the possibilities of real love. I'm glad I'm not gay because of the way people that are not gay look at gay people. I hear all the things that heterosexuals say about homosexuals. I won't repeat it here. I'm sure that many of you already know the opinions that are commonly spouted off by those that are not gay. And I'm also sure you already know how often people that are not gay shun and excommunicate people that are gay.

The Thornbury Theatre is the venue for the show with dinner and show or show only deals available. This is a beautiful venue perfectly suited to The Beer Diva’s relaxed and intimate style and should provide a stylish backdrop to what is a fun and engaging evening billed by its creator as ‘part theatre, part sensory indulgence’.
If you look at HanaDan closely, it’s not simply a story of a rich guy falling for a poor girl and changing into a good person because she’s so good. She’s not “good”, in fact, she’s pretty average and much is made of the fact that she is poor. She just loses it one day and decides that she’s had enough of his crap. Domyouji isn’t just a “bad-boy” rebelling for no reason. This is a deeply scarred, lonely boy who has to decide to develop into a functioning human being, because he didn’t even realize that he wasn’t one. He can’t express himself in socially acceptable ways. He doesn’t realize that punching someone in the face, simply because he annoys you, or because you feel sad is unacceptable. He doesn’t realize that you can’t get someone to love you by demanding it. Falling in love with someone forces him to examine himself, figure out why she isn’t just bowing down before him the way everyone else always does.
More than one billion people live without access to electricity, according to World Watch. But now, an often-overlooked natural resource and the development of green technology are connecting people with a stable power source and lifting them out of poverty.
Maybe it's because there's so much meaning in Ray's lyrics, maybe it's because Ray stands with George Harrison and Frank Zappa as one of the great idols of my youth, but there's such irony in Ray Davies telling us that his music is only there to dance to. Perhaps it's a comment on the direction they were taking, opting for a more commercial sound upon signing to Arista Records in 1976.

So, all these tests you are tempted to write, be they performance checks, static data population, or just something in a special style that doesn’t integrate well; delete them. Go on…. do it now…

I thought things would change after the ‘equinoctial gales’. It is traditionally a time when, if summer has been a little less than kind, the burgeoning vines, the bending limbs, the fully laden branches of fruit and Nature’s bounty make up for all the hard work, lost sleep, missed opportunities: the promise is fulfilled, Mother Earth comes through in spades, the sun shines and all is forgiven. The warm earth brings forth ripened plums, pears and apples in abundance, even a choice late cherry or two.

All passengers must attend a safety drill before setting sail, arriving with the life jacket from your cabin and following practical instructions on how to physically put it on. The initial fumbling did reveal how little you absorb from airplane safety demonstrations, but it was reassuring to know exactly where to go and what to do in the event of any emergency.

That’s not the case,
is difficult for several reasons: the plot is tough to handle stagewise (it is equivalent to Les Troyens), the cast is large and each role requires very subtle interpretative skills. Finally, one needs a delicate orchestra. Interestingly, this was the first time for Les Arts Florissants to perform an opera by Cavalli, and we did not have any doubt they would be fantastic -- like they always are. William Christie and his amazing orchestra always have an analytic approach to the score that helps them build the basic precision, but it is then always shaped in a delicate way that give the audience that extra artistic value that very few other orchestra can offer today.

It’s got to be more often than annual that this happens, that I read a book and end up so jinxed and amazed by the thing that my world sort of stops. Most frustratingly, when I find myself falling into one of these books, I don’t read as much: I try to force the book slower, and so it means that I spend a whole week or two just staring down one book, taking little readerly nips (something like the same thing’s happening presently with the upcoming Lewis Hyde). The latest book to have coated me in its ambery, time-slowing glow is Joe Flood’s The Fires, which I’ll just go ahead and claim here, barely halfway through the year, as among 2010′s best book. I’d actually like to get behind it right now and just say it’s *the* best book—that’s how hard it is to imagine a better book anytime soon.

Review: Wow, this book was amazing. This was the first James Patterson book I read and I cannot wait to read more! All four of the ladies in the Women’s Murder Club were excellent characters, with Lindsay being the main character (the novel is told by her in first person), as well as the excellent budding relationship between her and Raleigh. The chapters that Lindsay narrates are interspersed with chapters from the killer’s point of view as well so you get a full story as well as a mystery as you go along. The best part about the mystery is that even though you essentially know who the killer is since you’re getting his story, you don’t know who the killer is. And even better than that is just when you think it’s the end of the book, Oh wait – there’s more! And then you think THIS is the end of the book, happy ending, but Oh wait – there’s more! And THEN you think this is really the end, I know who the killer is now, Oh wait – there’s STILL more. Man, it was great! I have never seen so many twists and turns in a book and they really keep you guessing until the very end. And then there’s still more! What an excellent book, extremely well put-together, and I have to say, I’m always surprised when a male writer puts together such an excellent female character. I’m always impressed when a writer chooses the main character as the opposite sex – Personally, I’d just be able to write better about a woman because I am one. But bravo to James Patterson on all accounts! I highly recommend this one to anyone!!

Finding solutions is far easier once the problem is well defined. Instagram spent time writing down the top 5 problems people had with mobile photos. Such as, bad quality pictures, uploading and sharing. Then they looked to see how they might solve those issues. Solving problems people actually have is far easier to work on than making up something from nothing. They set about addressing something as trivial as uploading by reducing the image size, and starting the upload while someone writes the caption. They set about delighting people with their application by making it seem easy and seamless. You should verify you are solving the problem people have, and the only real way to do that is get your product in people’s hands for use and test your hypothesis. Many people wait to long to test and invest to much into unknowns. Don’t be put off by having simple solutions to simple problems. You don’t always need to solve huge problems, and sometimes the small problems at scale are hard enough and worth solving.

So now we're dancing around an April elopement. (I say 'dancing', but I'm actually dragging my heels with the reticence of Julia Roberts. There are skid marks an inch deep along our deck.) As part of this engagement 'negotiation', I asked Mr Mostly Perfect if he'd consider going to Paris for a honeymoon? Well I mean, it seemed liked the ideal trade-off. He got the wedding. I got Paris. "Just think honey–" I whispered. "Eiffel Tower. You. Me. A tiny bottle of pink bubbly. A perfect Parisian sunset. Who knows where the night could lead?" He turned and looked at me as if I'd just told him he had severe leprosy.

I found the ETERNAL to be very insightful, I got to see Evie in a different light and maybe I'm wrong but I don't recall every reading in either IMMORTAL or BETRAYAL where we got a sense of jealousy from her but in this book it seems to be a pretty strong feeling until about halfway. Sarah was always portrayed as the good friend, the one who hides nothing but will be there no matter what and we see how she begins to question that when things start taking a toll.

Pearls for embellish
THE moral of this, if any, is possibly pointed in the diary entry of Sir Harold Nicolson for May 12th, 1937, the day of George VI's coronation, to which both he and Ramsay MacDonald, a previous Prime Minister, had been invited:

At a recent forum at the United Nations (UN) in New York, reporters covering the UN wanted to know what the Nigerian government was doing to meet the top priorities contained in the MDGs within the target year of 2015.

Jerry writes of a transitioning art world, “It remains to be seen whether high prices are the global warming of the art world, imperiling an entire ecosystem. Perhaps the planet will adapt.

Because she went so long without any medical intervention, she did suffer some damage to her heart, but it is improving and she is working to get her heart function back. We learned after her surgery (where two stents were placed) that the problem was in her lateral anterior descending coronary artery. This is the artery that is also dubbed "the widowmaker" because it has a VERY high mortality rate. They tell us that it was 100% blocked by a blood clot that had developed on the stent they had placed there last year. How my mom survived so long with such a thing and how she is currently doing as remarkably well as she is... TRULY a miracle.

the weakest and strongest of us all;
Last night I sat and watched as parts of London were smashed to bits, set alight, looted. My husband and son were there (luckily safe, thank you for asking). I also followed the riots as they unfolded via Twitter--admittedly through the lens of the (mostly) bookish or journalistic people I follow. There I heard about more personal stories. Friends locked in and terrified by sounds of sirens and breaking glass (or by an ominous-seeming sudden silence--the calm before another storm?). Another friend told by a teenage girl who had just looted an i-Phone that 'I'm just getting back my taxes'. A whole road of Turkish people in Dalston who stood against the looters. Unconfirmed reports of restaurant guests who, when threatened by rioters demanding their jewellery, were defended by staff brandishing knives plucked hurriedly from the kitchens. A young woman escorted to safety by gallant youths 'because you're a girl, innit?' Motorbikes pelted with stones amid cries of 'who's next, man?'. A Waterstones bookshop left untouched, but a Gay bookshop smashed. There was a lot more--I merely give you snapshots. I didn't look at Facebook much, after I heard that an event page had been set up, inviting people to the 'riot party'. (I'm pretty fed up with Facebook at the moment, actually. It's turned rather nasty over the last weeks, what with the vile online bullying of my friend Amanda Craig, and some very unpleasant 'class-hatredy' comments about Horatio Chapple--the wretched 'polar bear' boy.) But I digress....
my book club ladies are nice and intelligent and interesting to talk to, but increasingly i see that they are not really my people. they tell me that i need to read books that are uplifting. books, by the way, in which i shall have to (i quote) "ignore dangling participles" and shush my inner grammarian. well, if something is worth saying, i believe it is worth saying well. if i have to drown in swooning ellipses and misguided pseudo-poeticisms, then the message becomes irrelevant. besides which, i find that most of these so called uplifting books are produced for (and by) people severely lacking in imagination - people who make up the bulk of western civilisation and are willing to vote for sarah palin and her ilk.

When I speak of trust and obedience, it stretches beyond a carnal view. It’s fully trusting that God really does what He has revealed through Romans 8:28, “And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.”. So, two things, He works all things for good to those who love Him and for those who are called to His purpose. Well, previously I had a prayer, to be used for His purpose that He may be glorified. I am called according to His purpose. He called me out of darkness, into the light. He met me in my bedroom as I was broken down, on my knees sobbing and called me to do His will, not mine. And now a decision point was at hand. Do I trust Him fully and become fully obedient to Him and His calling on my life? Well, easier said than done, but yes. I am doing it. It stretches me daily, but it’s another one of those truths I have added to my belt. I whip it out as a reminder that my life isn’t my own. He has called me to His purpose in such a timely manner that it’s remarkable how perfect His timing truly is. I look back on my life and how perfectly He aligned everything in such a beautiful way that I am constantly in awe of it. Pastor Mike said to me last night something that keeps me going, “Don’t lose the awe, Chris”…and he’s right. When you lose the awe of what God is doing, it’s over. You’ve now allowed the enemy to creep in and steal the glory, which is rightfully Gods. You’ve just handed over the keys to the gate.

When I was going through the little training course the morning of my jump the instructor anticipated the question: “What kind of fool would jump out of a perfectly good airplane”? He told us to answer the question when asked: “There’s no such thing as a perfectly good airplane”. This was, of course, in jest, but it fits well into the symbolism of this analogy. According to God, our lives are broken.
You would have expected the Victorian parliament to bring in rigorous laws, prohibiting the use of food adulteration - but not a bit of it! On the one side a public outcry led to an anti-adulteration bill being put before the House of Commons in 1857, but it was voted down, as was a similar bill in 1859. Oratory denounced the legislation

I just thought of another movie metaphor that illustrates the same thing. Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) in Field of Dreams, is speaking to an old ball player that never got a chance to bat in the majors. "Fifty years ago, for five minutes you came within... y-you came this close. It would KILL some men to get so close to their dream and not touch it. God, they'd consider it a tragedy." That is what Newt is feeling right now.

I’m not saying that waking up a different species would be amazing. For proof of this, just look at Jim Breuer and his post-Goat Boy career. Maybe that doesn’t fully make my point. All I’m saying is that waking up a sheep would be better than waking up as, say, Mel Gibson’s girlfriend. Or a sex toy.
yet another post that Blogger decided shouldn't go up as scheduled.
I have to say, I was one proud mommy! God spoke to my heart through those two little girls. One a 7 year old, the other a tween. He spoke to my heart even more when I got home and went into my daughter's bedroom and noticed her pink piggy bank lying on the floor and empty. It wasn't a lot that Nevaeh had in that bank...but it was ALL she had and she gave it so willingly.
Despite this small drawback, I do believe that readers from middle school onward will enjoy this story and the unique plot that the author has created.

Born in Shanghai, Gwynne moved to Washington, D.C., in 1949 with her family. During her 30-year professional career, she was a development executive for Regional Plan Association, St. Luke’s Roosevelt Hospital Center, Asian American Federation and China Institute in America and the development director for the Committee of 100′s. Additionally, Gwynne volunteered extensively in the Asian American community through the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center, Renwen Society and helped to raise critical millions that enabled the Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA), a small, grassroots community museum in Chinatown that tells the vital story of the Chinese diaspora and more than 160-year history of the Chinese in America.
I had to work nearly all day yesterday. Endless phone conferences, a few tech support requests while the “Modify Properties” team did the back-end upgrade work on our document management system. I didn’t have to pull the trigger on my part of things, I wasn’t given the go-ahead until 4:00, and then was told not to pull the trigger (deploy) until 6:00. But I was able to set that up, by the time of the 7:00 conference call it largely seemed to have gone off without much of a hitch at all. I hit 2000 machines inside of half an hour, with only 15 errors. User Support can handle those individually I think. I could take the afternoon today to investigate them but for those kind of numbers I think it can all wait until Monday. I bailed on the 9:00 PM conference call. I thought that 9:30 AM and 1:00 PM and 4:00 PM and 7:00 PM was enough. Fortunately the project manager agreed with me.
And then I randomly, suddenly, remember things about my ex. For example.
Thanks everyone for your sweet wishes for my first day in my new job yesterday! It went well and the team are really nice! I was totally phased out by the end of the day with so much to take in - even though all I did was listen all day!!
The players are aware that they are in control of the situation. Games in hand can be a delusional currency, offering hope until the games in question are viewed. Newcastle’s is a trip to Stamford Bridge against a post-Barcelona Chelsea. Even in victory, it is hard to see that South Siberia’s finest will not want the cushion of fourth place to ensure Champions League football of some sort next season. Which is before Newcastle contemplate their encounter with Manchester City.
The downsides of streaming. Streaming music will use up huge amounts of data. While this isn’t a problem in the UK, in Australia capped internet is what the majority of people have. For the highest quality streaming (which is premium only – more on that in a bit) we’re talking 2.4MB/minute. You only have to multiply that up to see the amount of data we’re talking – 2.4MB/min = 144MB/hr. If you have friends over and listen to music for 4hrs, we’re talking 576MB. If you like to listen to music all weekend, we could call that 10hrs a day for 2 days – 2.9GB. That’s a huge chunk out of your allowance. Hopefully unlimited deals will become more prevalent in the near future, but for now that’s what we’ve got.

She and I initially meet online and she agrees to travel to where I am vacationing for a sexual rendezvous. I am vacationing by the ocean alone and had not had sex for at least a month. So I was ready for this horny woman.

I empathize. I really do. No one wants to function as a one-Grace stream of consciousness twitterfeed dump. I freely admit that this would drive me nuts. But go back to your statement for a moment: "She is a really good friend..thoughtful, generous, kind, etc." Let's face it, nobody's perfect, and in most ways, she sounds pretty great. Friends like that don't sashay up the runway every day. That said, it doesn't mean that you have to become a repository for her minutiae. Take tactful, and ideally undetectable steps to combat the scourge.
There is a kind of relaxed feeling that wraps me when the healing is being done. I t feels as if all the negativity from the affected area is flowing out of my body and the relief is immediate.
Given all that has happened in just this last week I ask myself why we do what we do. Yes, my kids want to do all these things and some things they need to do. Yet when the activities are so time consuming, including with extra things like a sport team doing litter clean-up for community service, and Boy Scouts also adding in community service, and the church asking for community service, and the FIRST Robotics team doing community service, and parties and social events related to these activities, on top of all the normal stuff that group does, you wind up with very little free time as a family.

Less well recorded is what happened to the act after Cliff Bennett left the band (or was 'booted out' depending upon which story you believe) to form Toe Fat. Logically enough, they decided to continue as the plain old Rebel Rousers, and whilst Bennett's vocals are much missed on this single, the other elements remain intact. Both sides are equally strong, brittle and blaring pieces of brightly coloured pop created with the dancefloor in mind, and that the record wasn't a hit probably had more to do with the trends of the time than anything else - this sort of thing was incredibly passe by 1968, and Bennett's instincts to get a bit more sophisticated with Toe Fat seem, in this respect at least, less misguided than they may first appear. Still, the flip "As I Look" was later compiled as part of the "Chocolate Soup for Diabetics" series, and remains a favourite among retro DJs across the UK, regularly filling floors at mod nights. The copy I have is clearly a rather amateurishly produced bootleg made for the benefit of such wheel-of-steel spinners (I've never seen an original copy for sale anywhere) but it plays brilliantly despite the murky looking label.

“Ilana Mercer’s well-documented, encompassing study is at once heartbreaking, infuriating, illuminating and instructive. Ethnic cleansing is underway in the once great nation of South Africa, but Americans hear nothing of it; they are deliberately shielded by the same parties that served to bring it about, the liberal elites in Western governments and the press who believe that white South Africans ‘have it coming.’ It is white guilt and the so-called right of black reprisal extrapolated to ghastly extremes; political correctness on steroids, and all in the name of craven progressive ideology. If the West is ever to occupy anything resembling moral high ground – not to mention avoiding this fate itself – it will have to come to terms with its part in South Africa’s demise, and the misery, degradation and naked horror of those who now suffer.”
I thought about how, when one has rushed to the podium, one has urgent need of Imodium. I thought about the word Nickelodeon, its resemblance to Merkelodeon, and what daring naughtiness a Merkelodeon might show us. I pondered on the fairly useless question of the word Westminster, and how for some reason it made me thing of wet Ministers. And then finally, I mused about this message I’d seen on my pc screen the day before:
I also attended Kensington’s spotlight, and although my editor wasn’t there, I met with another editor, Martin Biro. After the spotlight I had a bunch of people stop me to talk about my experiences with Kensington. People were very interested in the new digital first division that will be launching soon.

He finds the charger, and also finds an estimate from a moving company: Mountain Top Moving & Storage. Britten is disturbed -- he didn't realize Hannah was this serious about moving to Portland. Even more disturbing is the fact that Hannah didn't tell him about this.

As expected, when asked for a trot, she very dramatically tossed her head and mane all around and threatened to buck, but from past experience I know this is just her attitude on a chilly day following a day off. We proceeded along on our ride, and heading back we galloped up the usual hill. It's not super steep, but it's long. I let her have her head to go as fast as she wanted, because she had so much pent up energy... we beat our previous record, recorded by the Cardio Trainer as 17.7mph, by going 18.1mph. I thought this was relatively fast, but when I looked it up, some horses gallop somewhere around almost 60mph...but... for a canter, I thought it was fast, and it was so fun! :)

Ultimately, the result was a positive one which just proves that going on strike and standing up for yourselves does work.

Without the image of God continually before us, other images, even physical ones, become the priority. In other words, although physical idolatry may not be committed, spiritual idolatry occurs if other images come before the image of God, so that when we look we do not see God. This is how almost the entire world lives: without seeing God in the world.

At one point, Fell says that, of the questions “who, how and why?” the most revealing, but usually by far the most puzzling, is why. I don’t mean merely the actual motive for the crime itself. I mean the why of certain other actions, eccentricities of behaviour, which centre round the performance of the crime....the why torments us even when we know, or think we know, the truth. Why did Mrs Thompson write those letters to Bywaters? Why did Mrs Maybrick soak the fly-papers in water? Why did Thomas Bartlett drink the chloroform? Why did Julia Wallace have an enemy in the world? Why did Herbert Bennett make a sexual attack on his own wife?” Good questions, but this is a book about an elaborate and improbable plot, rather than about criminal psychology.

But Kade was resolute; it was "yes" to "American Pie", "no" to "Happy Birthday", and that was that. So I learned it, prepared some lyrics sheets and found the music on-line, and put it all together.

Last time I recall being called a fag was ~ 2000 by a psychotic patient in State hospital. He was angry he couldn’t go out to smoke. I discount this as he was crazy as a loon. I remember in the late 90s being held hostage by a very nasty aggressive taxi driver who wouldn’t slow down when I asked him to do so. I gave him no tip; he called me a faggot after I got out of the cab.

It is a scandal that Hillside’s engineering workshops are being bypassed for the contract to build 300 flat-bed wagons, work which would have secured its ongoing future as one of the few heavy manufacturing entities left in the country – and certainly in the south. But the success of Fisher and Paykel Appliances’ Dunedin operation, which is expanding its staff numbers, is an example of the ways in which modern flexible businesses can reinvent themselves – in moving from the more traditional practices and technologies into the modern, more service-based support arenas.

One of the most poignant of the museum’s exhibits is the display of several dozen large photographs of Belgian Jewish children who died in the Holocaust. Their faces surround the visitor, covering the walls of the room as well as the ceiling. An audio recording reciting their names and ages in French and Flemish plays on a loop. Their names are no doubt among those of the 23,838 Belgian Jewish victims listed inside the main part of the Brussels memorial. Unfortunately, when I visited the memorial two days ago, all the gates were locked – probably to prevent another act of vandalism.
You would find Manhattan and the Bronx to be very walkable, with convenient transit. In Westchester County it would vary depending on where you went, but you could find a comfortable route at least as far as White Plains or Ossining. North of there you would find walkable downtowns like Poughkeepsie and Rhinebeck, some of them even served by halfway decent buses, separated by increasingly long stretches of inhospitable sprawl and country, until you reached Albany.

Prostitutes of the West worked in a hierarchical class structure, or a “whorearchy” (my term), in which the brothel was the highest rung. Also called parlor houses, they provided elaborate surroundings, luxuries, amenities, and the protection of a male bouncer if the clients became too rough. At the dawn of the twentieth century, one house in Colorado used electric lights, running water and a telephone. A staff of seven, including a bartender, a maid, and a musician, provided services other than sex. Of course, there were always five or six prostitutes. The Dumas Brothel in Butte, Montana was a three-story brick building that contained forty-three rooms and used pocket doors to create large rooms for parties.

I do miss sex, and getting to look forward to sex. I call it sex. What we did wasn’t sex. It was something more. I thought he felt it too, but maybe I was just any other girl with a vagina. He wasn’t any other dick to me. I miss sex, but sex is like food and you can get some McDonald’s if you need. That’s what I tell myself anyway. But I’ve – changed since him. My therapist once told me I had “grown up” because sex with my husband was no longer important to me. It wasn’t that. I had just finally accepted that he wasn’t ever going to care and nothing I was going to do was going to make sex with him good. It never was and it never would be. And so it was no longer something that I ever thought about. Accepting that it wasn’t going to ever be good was not the best thing when I tried to get back together with him. After I accepted, I couldn’t even make myself kiss him and I tried and we fought and argued. When I was “with” my ex-husband however I didn’t have any issue fucking my lover. I snorted when my therapist said my lack of interest in sex for my husband was “maturity.” I knew that it was not. This is the exact opposite and I’ve NEVER felt like I couldn’t drown my sorrows even temporarily in a man’s arms. But after HIM… I WANT to have sex. WITH HIM. I don’t have any desire for any other man. I get horny and frustrated and I know there are people I could call and I don’t want to call them. I just want HIM. So, while falling pretty quickly into some other man’s arms has always been a temporary bandage for my pain in the past, it is not this time. I don’t want to bandage the wound like that. It’s a strange realization. I just want him. That, however, I can’t accept because he doesn’t want me and I can’t change him. I can only change me. And I can’t chase someone who doesn’t want me.

I especially enjoyed doing flower arranging with the yellow freesia in a style known as misyoruyu. My teacher provided a kind of classic formula for the arrangement that I made. For example, the height of the first flower stalk “A” was to be twice the length of the shallow bowl plus the height of the bowl; the height of flower “B” was to be 3/4 the height of “A”. Those of you who know me well would guess that this algebraic approach would intrigue me—however, there was room for intuition in achieving balance and harmony in the composition.
Within the world of the film, dreams are created using the same system as movies (Cobb as director, Ariadne as writer, and various other members of the team working as actors, production managers, technicians, and moneymen).

Well, we were lucky enough to get an appointment with the pediatric dermatologist tomorrow morning at 8:30 in Denver. They are waiting to authorize an MRI until we’ve had a consultation with a doctor. I am very grateful. At the same time, I am freaked out. What will happen? What will they tell us? Is your little sister going to be ok? There are so many things running through my mind right now…it’s no wonder I can’t sleep. I’m hoping we will have an uneventful trip down there and that things will be laid out as simply as they can be and that little Abigail will be just fine. I am also realistic (or maybe it’s pessimistic) enough to know that may or may not be the case.
1707 A.D was the period of revival of high caste Hindu Nationalism and British, were invited by the propertied class of High Caste Hindus to subvert Mughal Rule in India. It was agreed that when British depart from the Indian Sub-continent, the mantle of power will be passed on to the propertied High Caste Hindus, who would resurrect the Unified India of Ram Rajya era. Elimination of Pakistan as a State is compatible with the ideals of Hindu Nationalism.

The thing is, if she didn’t behave in the way that she did, she would probably have a chance with Kevin. It’s all about playing it cool. If you play it cool then you will have more chance at winning. If someone doesn’t text you back – DON’T text them again. At least not today. Maybe in a few days… Or if you really can’t wait, then at least hold out until tomorrow. If someone doesn’t text back, they are probably busy or don’t want to talk right now. They will text you back later when they get a chance. I am just in shock at how psycho this chick has acted. Next time you are about to double text someone, just remember this bitch in your head and that you DON’T wanna come across like that.
One of the most wonderful inventions was the underwire- Add that to a firmer cup and you have a pretty supportive bra. This is the friend who, no matter what her feeding preference, will support you, look up answers to your nursing issues for you, tell you how proud she is of you. This is the husband, like Disney Daddy, who comforts you when you are crying from feeling like all you are is a big breast or milk sac to your child, tells you how proud they are, how much they appreciate what you are doing for your child and lets you know that you can do it. This is the pediatrician who reminds you the benefits of breastfeeding, lets you know that your child is healthy- even if they are smaller than a formula fed baby- and tells you to keep breastfeeding until you and child are ready to wean when your child is already 18 months old. This is true support.

Unfortunately, due to a scheduling conflict, Woods will be unable to make the trek north. So David Silverberg, host of the slam and artistic director of the Toronto Poetry Project, reached out to a sublimely talented poet with a strong connection to TPS to step into the breach.

In this case the really interesting thing is that the New Jersey fragmentary Plesiosaur is found in association with Pliocene dolphin fossils, mixed up together and only separated out later, and the Alabama fossils Leidy considered probably the same genus are labelled as coming from the Eocene zueglodon beds. In the case of the New Jersey Greensands, there is independant evidence that they are not only Cretaceous but also Tertiary: another site gives a paper in which several genera of O. C. Marsh's 'Cretaceous' birds from the New Jersey Greensands are actually of Eocene date or later.
So, I'm looking at backing down on things that won't make a difference in the long run. I don't have to finish my degree right now. It can wait. I don't have to grow everything especially when the Farmer's Market has organic veggies. I don't have to make our deodorant as Toms makes some great stuff. Check out the Lavender apparently it moisturizes. (did you know armpits need moisturized?)
On the second card I paired Freckles with his pal Peep. I ink distressed the background with three shades of distress inks. Freckles and Peep were colored with Copics, trimmed and mounted to the card. Isn't that the perfect sentiment?
I used to watch soaps way back in the day, the 90s I mean. There was nothing good to watch and I think my mom didn’t want to deal with my whining so I was put in front of the T.V. as if it were a god. Those were the good ol’ days.
Whether his trip was short due to a) security concerns, b) tight scheduling in meeting with other world leaders, or c) because the Secret Service won’t stay long in any place that doesn’t have strip clubs or many hookers, arriving and leaving under cover of darkness and making a speech at 4 am local time is a sad statement on where Afghanistan falls in the President’s priorities.

I got myself into trouble, by getting pregnant as a teen, and I really had to grow up faster than anyone else. Being a teen mum, well it was far from easy,I had to find a job and juggle school after the children’s father left me. I was pregnant with our second child, James. And still, I wouldn’t pray, I was still being stubborn, by being mad.

This, my friends, is the answer to the question that will move us forward. As a student of history, I believe that understanding the past is very important, but in the state’s eyes the 2010 security measures (some of which were new measures implemented at the state level) were enough improved that the 2010 data are not in question.

The point here is not about the healthfulness of butter (I’ll leave that question to the nutrition researchers and dietitians) but the shallowness of Pollan’s discussion of food processing. Pollan will later suggest that we should “entertain seriously the proposition that processed foods of any kind are a big part of the problem” (141). Yet he frequently mentions butter in a positive light, never mentioning how it comes to be. It’s a remarkable lack of nuance for somebody who claims to be arguing against a Manichaean ideology.

After Britten and Freeman explain this to Captain Harper, she tells them that an FBI agent who has been on the Gemini Killer case since its beginning will be flying in to join the investigation. We then meet the FBI agent, Elizabeth Santoro, on the phone with her ex-husband arguing about custody of their daughter. She tells Britten that she has been in Portland writing a book on the case, and that one detail of the murders they didn't make public was that the killer always left a two dollar bill in the victims hand. Since Britten's victim didn't have one, they definitely have a copycat killer. Britten asks her what Portland is like, and Santoro tells him it always rains, like London with hippies.
And where personal freedom is subjugated, learning is inhibited. In fact, it doesn't become learning at all; it becomes indoctrination. The students have no choice in what they learn, when they learn it, how they are taught it, or by whom. That, my friends, is indoctrination.

Following year-long deliberations, the Ad-Hoc Committee on the Protection of Information Bill tabled a new draft for parliamentary approval in September 2011. The bill is designed to regulate classification procedures of state information and proposes prison sentences of 15 to 20 years for publishing information deemed to threaten national security. Public engagement on the bill has been vociferous, with civil society arguing that, if promulgated, the bill would silence the media and whistleblowers and condone overreaching state secrecy. Despite improvements to the bill—such as the establishment of an independent Classification Review Panel and limitations on institutions that can classify information—it remains flawed. The absence of a public interest defense, permitting the publication of information that serves the public, is its most notable weakness. Public pressure—coordinated through the Right2Know Campaign, a civil society network of organizations opposed to the Protection of Information Bill—forced the ANC’s bill on September 20 to allow for further consultation.

I have yet to hear any of the candidates to answer my simple question, which I can't take credit for, but it is a question I think everyone of us should ask ourselves and those seeking office or holding it: HOW MUCH OF THE MONEY I EARN SHOULD I BE ABLE TO KEEP?

In pairing up foods with beer, we generally lean toward complimentary (rather than contrasting) profiles, and that’s what we’ll do here as well. Since impy stouts will be both sweet and bitter, and always full bodied, we’d suggest going that route with your food as well. For cheeses, go with crumbly, blue-veined cheeses such as stilton, smoked blue, and gorgonzola. With your dinner entree, you really want to go with a well marbled steak, possibly with a cream sauce. Full-fat burgers work fine, too, especially when cooked on the grill – consider adding crumbled blue cheese and bacon for the ultimate burger buddy. With dessert, you have a ton of options, from cheescake, to tiramisu, to plain old brownies with ice cream… preferably a coffee or chocolate chunk ice cream.
Fashion is most definitely an integral part of the culture in Spain. So much so that I have dedicated an entire section to it. It has to be said that Spain is home to some of the most stylish people I have ever encountered. They take such pride in their clean-cut elegant image and carry themselves with such dignity and composure that it´s hard not to admire them, sometimes even envy them!

This clear distinction between home-grown and external popular culture was only possible in the special atmosphere of the fifties and early sixties. The Nordic countries had for centuries been open for economic and cultural exchange, in neither field they had strived to beself-sufficient to same extent as bigger nations. Although cultural development had been channelled through the bottleneck of nation building since the early nineteenth century, a large part of the ‘national culture’ was clearly pan-Nordic and/or had obvious connections with European culture. Not only the great artists and writers, like Thorvaldsen, Strindberg and Munch, found it necessary to travel widely to learn and seek inspiration, the popular culture gladly received impulses from abroad. A part of the nation-building processes had been the spreading of dances and folk music of mixed origins, often with a strong German component, all over the Nordic countries - each district developing its own style, underlined by specially designed 'national dresses'. The high ratio of trade secured a steady import of new styles from most of Europe, and the emigration to America also had its feedback. In many areas of the Nordic countries up to one fourth of the population emigrated, there followed a vivid correspondence over the Atlantic and some of the emigrants came back bringing with them new tunes, new dance steps and new ideas.

One page I belong to has such an amazing, healthy approach to loss and grief. Her FB fanpage is called “Transcending Loss: Understanding the lifelong impact of grief” and says so clearly what it’s all about. Our loss or someone leaving our physical world is with us for a lifetime. Ashley Davis (Prend) Bush, LCSW, is a psychotherapist and grief counselor. She has been working with grievers for over 22 years. She has such insight and in my opinion, treats death, loss and grief in such a healthy way, acknowledging everyone as unique and in varying stages of grief. I encourage you to check out her FB page as well as her website. I’ll post her under my Resources/Links page of this blog too as it’s an extremely helpful resource.
As a child I was warned by my world-weary father that my life as a Birmingham City fan would be one of constant disappointment. So our recent history of promotions, top division football and cup wins has maybe led me to being a little complacent. I’d nearly forgotten that play-off game at home to Barnsley 12 years ago where we lost 4-0 and I spent the rest of the week swearing blind that my relationship with Birmingham City Football Club was at an end. Period. I soon snapped out of it though.

Today the boys are all home from school for Pulaski Day. While we were eating lunch, one of Kadin's friends called. Kadin said he couldn't talk, we were eating and he would call him back. Five minutes later, the kid calls back. We don't answer. Two minutes later, he calls again. We don't answer. Finally after the child had called four times in a row in less than 10 minutes, Cullen lets out this huge sigh and says...
Adopted children? Often come to us hurting. Even if they experienced "little" in the way of trauma before entering our lives, the very act of adoption is traumatic. Because there is loss in the act of adoption, it's inevitable that our children will struggle, at least some of the time and often more than that, especially in the early years. We must be patient with them. We must give them what they need, when they need it, even if it does not match up to our expectations.
The weather here is beautiful today. The boys are back at school and kindy after a great few weeks holiday and some much needed family time.

Now, with all that in your head lets add another side to the shape. Well let’s add the ‘z’ axis or the third dimension. So now instead of standing or spiraling on a flat plane, lets take your center inside a complete cube. With six walls to shape around you instead of four flat lines. Lets also make the area the shape covers about fifty times as large. So now your existence is quite smaller, and if you were to slip away from the walls you would have a considerably larger area to drift out and away from your “safety zone”.

Salt water, or brine, seems to be the world-champion rendering agent for olives. That and its partner-in-alchemy, time. There are many very precise recipes available, but extracting an average from them gets the following result: immerse your olives in fresh water and change it daily, for between three and seven days. Then swap this for very salty water. Change this weekly for as many weeks as it takes for the olives to become edible. Green – unripe – olives may benefit from an alkalising agent being added to the water at some point early in the curing process. Oh, and if you slice or crush the fruit a bit before curing, it may or may not take less time.

In Spain, as in most of Europe, they are afforded the convenience of smaller and more compact cities. They do not experience the sprawling suburbs and ten miles trips to the grocery store as seen in other first-world countries such as the Unites States. Relatively then driving is not as requisite for daily activities, which has resulted in the overwhelming success of small cars in Spain and throughout Europe, specifically two and four-door hatchback models such as the Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus. Pushing for even smaller and more fuel efficient vehicles, Spain’s government has launched several initiatives in the last year promoting efficient vehicles, such as the VIVE plan and prime-minister Zapatero’s objective to put one million electric cars on the road by 2014. Further urging consumers, at the beginning of 2008, the government began imposing hefty taxes on vehicles whose emissions output exceeded certain limits.

Of course the bigger issue is that those who need assistance don't always make the decisions we want them to. Should they have to? Should they have to make the decisions we want them to in order to gain our assistance? There is an argument perhaps that assistance for some people is a waste because the person will use it unwisely and require more and more and more assistance. Maybe resources could be better spent other ways?

Many Americans on the left thought the sinking of the Reuben James to be the sort of wake-up call that would push Germany-favoring Americans to reconsider, and people undecided to side with Britain.

I admit rather sheepishly that most of her problem at the mounting block has probably been my fault. For years I’ve been a little tense while mounting. Not just her but any horse (except Erik--he stood like a rock; it was his best gait.) I’ve always been anxious that a horse would move off while I was halfway on (Dusty did this a lot) or I would somehow fall in-between the mounting block and the horse and get trampled. There’s no sense telling someone not to be fearful if they’ve got it in their head that something could go wrong. I know it’s an unfounded and foolish fear, but there you have it. Once I’m on I can usually deal with any antic a horse can throw at me, including ducking out at jumps or galloping around during a spook. I’m not an apprehensive rider, but that whole mounting process has me tense and nervous. Go figure. Maybe if that’s the worst thing I have to deal with it’s not so bad. So while Dusty is getting over her issues, I’m working on getting over mine. Actually, I’m feeling pretty

In that moment, wouldn’t you just love to know what it’s like to live in a world that is just like that field? Oh, I would. To be content, just appreciating the blessings right in front of me.

Some parents need to make a choice between spending money on transportation to the hospital to be with their baby, or between buying healthy food for their older children. Others are at risk of losing their baby at discharge because they lack the money to buy a crib or car seat, a requirement to bring one’s baby home. These are families who are otherwise very capable of providing a loving and home for their babies.

Bardwell told the paper that he believes interracial marriages do not last and that the children of such unions are not accepted by either the black or white community.
Accepting a relationship is over; is hard. It gives you that feeling where you want to cry, but when you start crying you can’t catch your breath and so you feel like you’re hyperventilating? That feeling where in between tears you say shit like “oh my god” half because you can’t believe that you feel so low and half because you actually might die if you don’t catch your next breath in time? Well THAT is how I feel!

For some time now, I've been waiting for someone to ask me why I didn't honor a particular, recently deceased person. I would then explain my reasons in the comment section. I thought it might be Tony Curtis, but nobody ever asked about him. Poor Tony. Instead, in the comment section of an "In Memoriam" honoring Don Meredith, fellow blogger and frequent visitor Dreamfarm Girl wanted to know why I was ignoring Elizabeth Edwards, who died around the same time.

Also, if we are in movie world for nothing-to-do-with-the-religion sort of references, I’d bring out Midsomer Murders’ episode “The Magician’s Nephew”. In that episode, Ernest Balliol is the high priest of theTempleofThoth, a pagan cult, and is extremely upset when Aloysius Wilmington, an old friend and local magician, publishes a book declaiming the cult as nothing more than a drunken invention. During the Cabinet of Death routine in Aloysius’ magic act, his assistant Jean Wildacre is stabbed with poisoned daggers and a ritual knife is left in the cabinet. Meanwhile, Ernest is relying on his daughter Isolde to charm Aloysius’ nephew Simon into finding a book in Aloysius’ library that her father thinks will prove the existence of the cult.

1. Yesterday I found this exact same coat at the thrift store: Lands End Down Chalet Coat. Except mine was $10.00. If you live here in the Midwest, you know what a score that is. And yes, it's one size too small but I will fit into it next winter. The coat I have now is losing feathers rapidly, due to a big rip in the side that happened when I first zipped it up this year. Zipped it up over my fat ass. So yay for me.
Wow, that didn’t come out right.

We would like to avoid this, but feel that the window of opportunity is closing rather more quickly than some might imagine. Our greatest concern is that, despite the growing anger and alarm on the part of the British people with respect to mass immigration in general and Muslim immigration in particular, these feelings might not give rise to the necessary coalescence of political will on the part of our elected representatives in time to try and prevent the horrendous future that otherwise awaits us. We say again that the only course of action that gives us the slightest chance of avoiding the horrors outlined here is that of shutting down Muslim immigration and refusing to subsidize the higher Muslim fertility that is pushing us towards the brink. If Muslim immigration is shut down, if the cessation of all influxes of Muslims from the ‘old country’ helps Muslims integrate (whatever one understands by the term), and if the Muslim population of the UK stabilizes at a sufficiently low level (whatever that level might be), then there is at least a slight possibility that a British vs. Muslim violent conflict can still be avoided.
When the teacher placed before us a painted globe and said that our world was like that, that upon such a thing our forefathers had roamed and hunted for untold ages, as it whirled and danced around the sun in space – I felt that my foothold was deserting me. All my savage training and philosophy were in the air, if these things were true.

We had neither swimsuits or towels (now I know to always bring a swimsuit which I note in Travel Savvy Packing), so we already made the process that much harder to complete by needing to rent them. Nevertheless, I read the section of the bath experience at least ten times, and Brett heard me read it to him ten times, emphasizing different things to him with each reread: “It says couples can share a changing cabin, so that will eliminate one step.” “We go IN the changing area and then rent the swimsuits from the place down the hall to the right.” “There are two entrances, but the book explains the second less used entrance, so that is the one we have to use.” I tried to commit these directions to memory. We were prepared as could be. Even so, our issues started before we entered the building.

At first I thought the fact I feel so proud of him means that I’m learning to be ok with this, that I’m getting over it … realistically it’s because I love him with all my heart and I want him to achieve his dreams, everything I knew he was capable of.

I know, my dear, that you dream of a day when all men will live in harmony and peace. That day is drawing near. How soon, is up to all of you. There is no time to waste. Accept that you can do this. It would not have been asked of you, otherwise. Let all that you do, be done with LOVE.
Despite the age of the building, much of the internal decoration is far more recent, following alterations in the 19th and 20th centuries culminating in the extensive restoration of the church in 1960. The oak pews date from the 1970s, the pew ends featuring intricately carved descriptions and decoration. In another nod to Dedham’s transatlantic connections, one commemorates the NASA Apollo missions, while another is dedicated to the people of Dedham, MA, who in 1967 gave over £1000 towards the upkeep of the church.

So it goes like this, and I'll try not to be long winded (give me the cliff notes, my husband directs). We have three children, Sophie (5), Gabriella (3) and Nicholas who turned a big boy one only yesterday 16/4. Gee, and doesn't that third child miss out in advanced planning for important events? Anyway, cliff notes, I bought two new AWW kids party cake and cupcake books (yes, to add to my extensive collection, for inspiration). Anyway I did have to buy them because it's important to 'share' with my friends. I saw the cutest 'good ship' cupcake style cake complete with an owl, a pussy cat AND a pea green boat and I knew instantly Nicholas 'needed' to have an "Owl and the Pussy Cat' party!

No trip to Las Vegas is a complete without a gluttonous visit to a buffet. Yes, I said a buffet. While there are inherently undesirable traits about buffets, we visited one nonetheless. Not once, but twice, we visited the Wicked Spoon. The first time was because I had read that this was one of the better buffets. The second time was because both @Windaddict and I won a free dinner buffet. Before we jump into the photos, I'll go through the pros and cons.

Every year my friends and I participate in our school's Relay for Life to benefit the American Cancer Society. The presentation before the Luminaria ceremony is always very moving, as photos of our classmates and our classmates' loved ones who have passed and who have survived are flashed up on the screen to tear-jerking music. The tears were coming with each picture but particularly, every time I saw a face on the screen who had died young my eyes welled up, thinking how much life they could have had left if it wasn't for this terrible disease. I was also struck by how many familiar faces from college's parents had died or have been affected by cancer. Though I had not known many of these people personally, they were the people I see every day walking to class or waiting in line in the cafe. It's incredible how much you may not know about a stranger, how many people are walking around with a burden on their shoulders and not letting it show.
Hopefully I'll have more action in my later movies, this is after all, my directorial debut.

Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer – the duo that wrote and directed Vampires Suck – have managed to fit just about every pop-culture reference into the 82-minute time frame as humanly possible, including “the douchebags from Jersey Shore” (their quote, not mine). The Jonas Brothers, The Wizards of Waverly Place, Taylor Swift, Chris Brown, and purity rings are all included, but not one reference manages to be funny or creative. In fact, the only time I laughed out loud was when Jacob’s wolf pack came out and started doing something I genuinely didn’t expect. Excepting this one moment of humor, Vampires Suck tried too hard to be funny, which never works.
Next, and by next I mean hours later, we got to the Badlands. Oh this place, everyone must go there (well everyone must go to all the places I went, they're national treasures). They just appear out of no where, it makes you wonder how scary this place was for travelers in the 19th century coming in ox cart. Anyway the Badlands were formed by wind and water erosion in clay rich soil and are actually slowly moving. There is another set of "badlands" in Theodore Roosevelt NP in North Dakota as well. Read more about this crazy beautiful place here on wikipedia or of course the NP website. While we were there I bought us a National Park pass, which I suggest everyone to get, its good for a year and grants access to all the national park/monument/wilderness area/forest/etc that you have to pay for.

Eventually I quit asking her questions. Later, as an adult, I realized how anxious and scared she’d been herself through those years. With the passage of enough time I even forgave her, as children do, though my whole-hearted respect never returned.
The New Testament hope, on the other hand, looks forward to that great day when mortal flesh should put on immortality (1 Corinthians 15:53-54). Rather than standing naked before God, the apostle Paul looks eagerly to that day when our souls are clothed with their new heavenly bodies (see 2 Corinthians 5:1-5). And our personal hope is the hope of all the material universe, which groans in longing for that day when it will come to share the glorious liberty of the children of God (Romans 8:21).

I think that the inherent danger for people on both sides of the cross is that we can easily become reliant on our good deeds. Because no good deed goes unpaid there is always a reaction to our good deeds and most of the time it is a positive reaction. Furthermore, our goods deeds, at a purely human level, actually are good and do often accomplish many positive things. The problem is that they just aren’t good enough to save us. Not even close. So it is very easy for us to feel comfortable in our lives and feel as if we are ok because I am a good person just:

There the son of Cronos used to lie with the rich-tressed nymph, unseen by deathless gods and mortal men, at dead of night while sweet sleep should hold white-armed Hera fast.”
