--LF Darnell McDonald prepared for the 39-degree gametime temperature Friday night in Chicago by wearing headgear that covered his ears and part of his face. And after finishing 2-for-4 with four RBI, including a three-run double that broke a 3-3 tie in the Red Sox's 10-3 victory, he may not want to change his look.

Now, this kind of thing, together with the state of affairs that lies back of it, has bred a fear of good, honest, well-paid craftsmanship that is at the bottom of the very genuine anti-union sentiment that you find here. This sentiment, no doubt, had its origin in the disturbances that led to the dynamiting of the Los Angeles Times' office some years ago, and Big Business certainly had a hand in that fight.

Legislators should approve the bill. It's a reasonable plan to ensure that communities derive certain benefits from the projects they host and continue to support them.

Ruxer credits the strong rapport he has developed with Louisville pitching coach Roger Williams, who has encouraged him to pitch to his strengths and let his defense help him out. Ruxer isn't the type to blow away batters, having 23 strikeouts in 432/3 innings, so keeping hitters off-balance is a huge key.

The Grizzlies (31-0), who've lost just one match the past two seasons, controlled the match throughout, especially behind the play of Gonzales and reigning 2A player of the year Bethany Moss. That's not to say that Burlington didn't have its moments, especially by the play of junior Bailey Tillitson and senior Kristen Hildebrandt. But for every point the Cougars (29-2) could muster, Fowler would go on a 10-2 run, like it did to close the opening set, or another 10-2 run in the game-ending third set.
The drug ostensibly is for horses who have amino acid deficiencies, said Allen, but noted, "horses are not amino acid-deprived; they get plenty of amino acid and protein in their regular diet."

1. Wisconsin got hot in the final 13 minutes, making three straight 3-pointers and seven of 11 3-pointers to wipe out a 15-point Ohio State lead.

"Like I mentioned in the pre-draft analysis he can beat 1-on-1 blocks to get to ball carriers and is simply big enough to clog gaps in the offensive line.

The Miramonte parent center was originally scheduled with a later group of projects but was accelerated as part of measures taken to assist that community and restore public confidence.

When the committee approved his nomination for a floor vote, Shea was arguing before the state Supreme Court in an effort to set aside a $2.75 million verdict against St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center.

Heading into this year's presidential and congressional races, Democratic strategists had hoped the grassroots Occupy movement, with its outrage over widening income inequality and what it sees as lax government oversight of corporate interests, would help energize the more progressive fringes of the party's base - much the way the tea party did for conservative Republicans in the 2010 midterms.
“I had no idea what she was talking about,” he says. “Then Emily related that the Ford Foundation felt that it didn’t have enough presence on the Princeton campus, so it gave them a good sum of money to bring two playwrights who’d give a series of lectures to the students and develop a new play.

There are so many inaccuracies and false statements in Gerald Beliveau's letter to the editor that any rebuttal could easily surpass the word limit set by the editor. However, one assertion was so outrageously incorrect that it begs a response. His statement that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) and the FBI both consider environmentalists to be the most dangerous political group in America is simply untrue. The FBI does not publish a list of dangerous groups (there are, however, three eco-terrorists on their fugitive list). The SPLC, however, does publish such a list. No environmentalist groups are on their list.

In that system - instituted by the 21st Amendment - each state has wide latitude to regulate alcohol within its borders. Beer is generally sold by breweries to wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers. The "three-tier system," as the industry calls it, dates to the end of Prohibition in the 1930s and was intended to control the flow of alcohol and some of the worst abuses connected to over-saturation of alcohol.
I'm a sucker for creamy fresh cheeses in these main-course salads, partly because they add a pillowy lightness to the mix and because they look pretty next to colorful produce. Salty and briny cheeses are good choices for adding extra punch, such as feta cheese with the koftas. Fresh goat cheese is subtle enough to go with delicate frisee, and its acidity offsets the nectarines. Salted ricotta, or ricotta salata, next to grilled eggplant mirrors the flavors in pasta alla Norma, a Sicilian pasta dish of eggplant, tomato, ricotta salata and basil.

There's a gambler or a horse lover in every family, right? If it's racing season (Dec. 26-April 22), take him, her or them to Santa Anita Park (285 W. Huntington Drive, Arcadia), where Seabiscuit once galloped to glory and the view of the San Gabriels is reliably gorgeous. Horses usually run Thursdays-Sundays. For just the cost of breakfast, you can watch early workouts (from 5-10 a.m.) from Clocker's Corner at the west end of the track. In the afternoon, for $5 adult admission, you can watch the races or linger near the paddock and gardens as horses, jockeys and trainers prepare. If it isn't racing season, head north to cozy Sierra Madre, park on East Miramonte Avenue near North Mountain Trail Avenue, and hike the first 1.3 miles of the Mt. Wilson Trail, which will jump-start your heart and give you a big view. Then turn around at First Water, come down and flop on a couch at Bean Town coffeehouse (45 N.

What: This cat is deep. He writes and sings songs worthy of his resonant baritone. Sometimes sweeping, sometimes sparse, each melody is like a cleansing storm. It's small wonder that his music has found its way into TV show soundtracks, including those for "Grey's Anatomy," "One Tree Hill" and "Ghost Whisperer." England's Joe Brooks, who opens the show, delivers meaty lyrics with delightfully winsome vocals.

Not everyone is happy with the outcome. Phil Kent, an anti-illegal immigration activist who is on the state's new Immigration Enforcement Review Board, said it's an injustice that Colotl was allowed into pretrial diversion. "All I can say is I hope Judge Mary Staley doesn’t sign off on this," said Kent, whose board does not have a say in the matter.
Add to the tally of black males 14 and older slain across the country from 1976 to 2005, another 29,335 (slain from 2006 to 2010), and their national body count rises to 243,996, representing 82 percent of all black homicides for that 35-year period. What also becomes clear is this: We too often have raised killers. And this war is claiming our sons.
In the end, Republicans say it was just a poorly calculated decision by the Democrats.
When these chefs cook in their restaurants, they are performers, public figures being judged, weighed, called out, praised. But at home, many of them are simply moms and dads, creating food memories for their own children the way their moms did for them.
Trakas' last two non-political jobs listed on his resume: commercial sales representative for Nature Stone Floors of Bedford and public policy coordinator at Lorain County Community College, which he left so he could run for Congress in 2008.
Consider: Hellman zealously supported the Moscow line on Trotsky, offering no criticism when he was murdered by Kremlin agents; she defended Stalin's mass executions of party cadres in 1937-38, signing a petition that accused the victims of being "spies and wreckers" of socialism; she supported Stalin's alliance with Nazi Germany, despite her supposed devotion to "anti-fascism," and defended Moscow's indefensible invasion of Finland in 1939-40, claiming that the country supported Nazism and deserved no pity, a scurrilous lie that Ms. Kessler-Harris leaves unchallenged.
"This truly is an outrageous case of abuse of public office," she said. "Rather than setting a personal example of how to honor your oath of office, Spicuzzo set the worst example possible."
We’ve got an interesting debate on our hands today because, well, are the Giants (6-6) better than what they showed today?
A win by either side has been cause for celebration. The teams have been the fiercest of Class 5 rivals for a decade, often knocking each other out of the playoffs or meeting in district championship games.

It is good to hear that former GovernorRobert L. Ehrlich Jr.is providing a "spirit of healthy dissent" with his column in The Sun ("Ehrlich column to run in The Sun," Jan. 22).

CEO Enrique Salem said Symantec's data-storage business has been hurt as Sun Microsystems servers, now made by Oracle (ORCL), have lost market share, which Oracle has said is part of a strategy to focus on more profitable deals. Symantec's data-storage software has traditionally been sold alongside Sun servers, Salem said.
Gingrich exited with typical disorder. First he was pre-empted by an aide, who announced last week that the candidate would quit. This week, Gingrich pre-empted himself, making a video on Tuesday to give supporters "insider advance notice." That left little mystery on Wednesday afternoon, only the contradiction of having Gingrich, who campaigned against Washington and the national media, making his formal announcement inside the Beltway to the national media.
Same goes for chef Toshihiro Nagano of Skool in San Francisco. His awa-spiced salmon features skin-on fillets encrusted with a variety of spices and grains, including millet (awa), peppercorns, coriander and fennel.

Others are under review.
It isn't just that Latinos are the fastest-growing segment of the U.S population. Or that people of Hispanic origin make up the country's largest ethnic minority at 16.3 percent of the population. While the census data are remarkable, what's most interesting to Lisa Franek, the artistic director, is the myriad stories within this booming segment just waiting to be told on film. "Latinos in this country aren't a monolithic culture. It's a fusion of multiple cultures," Franek said.

But the United States exports three times more to Latin America than to China, according to U.S. figures.

Every screening at this year's Telluride Film Festival was preceded by someone standing at a microphone and delivering what came to be known as the "SS" speech -- an appeal to consider the auditorium a sacred space, coupled with a request to turn off all cellphones, pagers, BlackBerrys and other communication gizmos that often blight the movie-going experience. The effort was successful, with a few piercing, trilling or warbling exceptions. Those who made the uphill pilgrimage to the 32nd annual festival in this picturesque old mining town, perched in the Rockies at an altitude of almost 9,000 feet, already shared a deep respect for the film medium. If cell-free reverence was in order, they were glad to give it a shot.
Tempe residents are experiencing some relief from the noise generated by planes at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, but Phoenix residents are getting an earful.
Smith: Funding, including doing everything we can to maintain and amplify the city's commitment to funding. Supporting the proposed arts levy from the Creative Advocacy Network initiative or a version of it. If the promoters find that the existing issue is going to be hard to pass or if there are too many other things on the ballot, that we have a Plan B. And that plan is to combine an arts education levy with a parks levy, either in the context of a children's initiative or separate from that. Support existing programs but also particularly to amplify them around our plan for Portland summers so that our city has the most robust set of summer enrichment programs of any major city in the country. That can do a lot to increase graduation rates, improve educational competitiveness and be a great way for the education community and the arts community to better interface. We can encourage more and help zone for more and fund more live-work spaces. Milepost 5 is an example of an experiment that seems to be working. And if we link that idea to our plans to invest in East Portland. Maybe the next one is not on 82nd Avenue. Maybe the next one is in conjunction with Gateway Education Center or even further east.

The judges aren't so crazy about Peach's polka-dot concoction, her third try at an ensemble. Michael says it looks like an Amish cocktail dress. And they really don't dig Jason's silver "infinity" dress, saying it doesn't work for either day or night. Michael says if a woman showed up wearing it to work, everybody would wonder if if it was a "walk of shame" dress. And that safety-pin holding the middle together in the photo? Not good. As for Nicholas, he tried to do too much and none of it very well -- his model wears a cape over a blouse with a peekaboo back and a skirt with detailing that doesn't help matters. Michael thinks that cape makes the wearer look like she might be joining a religious sect.

Cargill does business in 65 countries. It ships U.S. commodities abroad, but it also buys and ships 70 percent of Vietnam's cocoa crop and provides feed for the country's pig farms.

Obama said all of this could be paid for if the congressional supercommittee that is beginning work raises its deficit-reduction target enough to cover the costs. He also promised to issue his own blueprint for additional deficit reduction.
For sure, no one looks more prescient today than the 10 legislators who wrote the NRC weeks before Fukushima begging for public hearings in California before the renewal proceedings go very far.

The American Council on Exercise says that these vintage fitness courses are part of a nationwide trend to involve the entire body when working out. "It's like boot-camp training or strong-man training, where you aren't just working on one muscle at a time," said Pete McCall, an exercise physiologist for the council. "When you do any type of swordplay or fencing, you have an unlimited, unrestricted range of motion. In swordplay, for instance, you're engaging your hips, core, chest and shoulders just when you do a step and thrust with the sword. The body is designed to move in a variety of ways, which is preferable in a workout. That's just not the case with a weight machines, where your motion is restricted and the muscle activity is limited."

It was the company’s anti-union tactics and poor health benefits that made her economically dependent on Handley.

Or so she claims.

We learned that Melissa Gilbert isn't the only one with injuries. Her partner Maks Chmerkovskiy has been in a lot of pain from a cyst in his foot. While Maks was sidelined icing his aches, eliminated brother Val stepped in during rehearsals. But Maks was able to dance the Argentine tango to Mozart's "The Marriage of Figaro," and he included lifts and twirls and leaps. Melissa looked a tad overwhelmed at times. The drama of it all won the audience over, but not the judges. Bruno said "it wasn't clean." Carrie Ann said it was "Cirque du Soleil gone terribly wrong." Maks got angrier by the minute as he heard their critiques, but kept quiet as the crowd booed. Len thought some "quality" was lost due to the intensity of the moves. Defending herself, Melissa said, "It felt good to me. ... And I hope the audience enjoyed it, too." Scores: 7, 7, 7 = 21 When asked by co-host Brooke Burke-Charvet, "What do you think, Maks?" He replied: "I don't think, I just dance." Final score: 21 + 26 = 47

There were disappointments with regard to our agenda, to be sure. Instead of compact and competitive new legislative and congressional districts, we got power politics as usual. The need for more flexibility on school personnel decisions went down in the flames of Issue 2. Too many local government officials still say they want to share services, then find excuses not to. Cleveland and Cuyahoga County officials still need a creative, public discussion of how to use casino revenues. And the public needs to be more involved in discussions of how to make Cleveland's evolving downtown a walkable, connected regional destination.

Like most everything else in the food world, even the bulk bins have gone exotic. There, along with nutritional yeast and granola, you'll find grains of every type and hue. Quinoa, certainly — but not just plain old. You can also find it in beet red and in black (and yes, the colors remain after cooking).
There is honor on both sides. Good people can come to different conclusions for sincere and honest reasons. Get together for coffee, shake hands, say each to the other “Thank you,” find common ground.
In addition to Sanu, Rutgers will lose four other offensive starters — linemen Desmond Wynn, Art Forst and Caleb Ruch, as well as fullback Joe Martinek. But there are solid replacements already for those four.

Holiday Hill, the little amusement park on Natural Bridge and Brown Road, was a fun place with a few good rides, but nothing like the Comet. There had been a big coaster at the old Chain of Rocks Park up on Riverview Drive, but it was already gone by then. (I later learned of a bygone place called Westlake Park on St. Charles Rock Road. It had a tremendous wooden roller coaster that burned down in 1955, but I have no personal recollections of that one.)
The most conventional works in the show in terms of media are Chen Wei's dark-edged drawings of objects and figures, including a hooded man who shines a flashlight on the ground.

The best thing about it might be that they don't need to revel in one shining moment from a largely forgettable season. The O's are in second place in the American League East and playing some of their best baseball in many years.

McCain, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, said illegal immigrants who overstay their visas are a "serious problem." But "certainly not along the lines of what is happening on our border, though," McCain said, mentioning the killing of rancher Robert Krentz and the April 30 wounding of a Pinal County sheriff's deputy. Drug smugglers are suspected in both incidents. There also are fears that the increasing cartel violence in Mexico, where tens of thousands have been killed since the 2006 war on drugs began, could spill over the border.

Peavy’s strikeout total -- five -- was down on Monday, when he got only seven swings-and-misses in his 107 pitches. His velocity was down a tick from his start against the Orioles five days earlier, and after using a 92-mph fastball to get a swinging strikeout on the first batter of his night, Jemile Weeks, he did throw a fastball past another hitter. But he had terrific command on all his pitches, and the 89-91 mph fastballs were weapon enough to keep hitters from sitting on off-speed pitches.

There are nods to more silent movies and stars than you'll care to tally. That's fun, as far as it goes, but what's important is that Hazanvicius and Dujardin create characters and situations that feel original -- situations that, despite the broadly played bits familiar to silent-film fans, have the same heart found in the movies of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton.

3) A crazy play. Okay, it will be tough to match, let alone top, Manning-to-Tyree, which has 17 different ridiculous components to it, including Manning refusing to go down when he had half the Patriots defense grabbing his jersey, the usually clumsy Manning then keeping his feet after escaping, the little-used Tyree out-leaping and out-muscling the Patriots’ Rodney Harrison and clamping the ball to his helmet with one arm. The escape alone, or the catch alone, would have been incredible; the two together made it immortal, something that even nonfootball fans could look at and say, "Wow. That was insane."

Out of nowhere came this police officer waving a pad and shouting, 'You're getting a ticket in the mail.' My daughter-in-law and I looked at each other. That officer then went to the other car and said the same thing. Hopefully she met her ticket quota and was soon to be finished alienating bewildered visitors to your city. What a welcome."

Founded in 1948, the Seoul Philharmonic is the oldest Korean orchestra and a showcase for a country that has become both a classical music and an economic epicenter for Asia.
