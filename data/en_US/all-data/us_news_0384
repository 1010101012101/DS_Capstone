IMPERTURBABLE RINNE: Some goaltenders, like Boston's Tim Thomas and Buffalo's Ryan Miller, are prone to let their tempers show during games. The Wings have had no such success with Rinne, who is as even-tempered on the ice as he is off. Even on the morning of a potential elimination game, he spoke for a good 10 minutes to reporters. "To me it's not a big deal if I talk to media," he said. "Before games, I'm probably a little bit more quiet than usual, but I still like to fool around with my teammates and joke around and stay loose, don't get too serious."

Tracey Amend, principal of Broomfield's Mountain View Elementary School, as an at-will employee, declined to comment on the $6.85 million in cuts to be negotiated with the teachers' association, but said she thought the other half of the plan was fair.

On April 18, 1943, a flight of US Army Air Force P-38s intercepted a plane carrying Adm. Isoruku Yamamoto, Japan's naval commander in chief and architect of the Pearl Harbor attack, and blew it out of the sky. Like the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the shootdown was a combination of painstaking intelligence work and flawless military execution -- but it certainly wasn't the end of the war in the Pacific.

"Slow down" was the overriding message to Barack Obama, a first-term president with big ambitions who used his big Democratic majorities in Congress to try to transform the nation.

Like any other drink, it is only as good as its worst ingredient. Fortunately, the basic margarita only has three: tequila, triple sec and lime juice. Choose a spirit made of 100% agave, stock your bar with a solid orange-flavored liqueur, squeeze fresh lime juice—think of how strong your forearms will get!—and nail the proportions and you'll have a wonderfully balanced sweet, tangy, slightly earthy (that's the 100% agave) drink to sip this Cinco de Mayo and throughout the summer.

When I was a player at the University of Tennessee-Martin, we played at Tennessee Tech for three straight games, and we didn't wash our uniforms. We only had one set. We played because we loved the game. We didn't think anything about it.''

An abysmally small percentage of students who graduated from L.A. Unified schools last year — 15% — qualified to enter a four-year college. The district could certainly improve on this, yet the school board has little choice at this point but to ease the requirements; it would be unfair and counterproductive to hold students to a standard they have not been prepared to achieve. But in its next move to improve educational outcomes, the board should focus first on a coherent plan for improving instruction, not on an arbitrary bar.
The family had their suspicions. Three days after Champion was beaten unconscious during a band trip to Orlando, the Orange County sheriff suggested that hazing had been involved.

Who knew I would taste the best miso soup ever at Kemosabe Sushi Bar, a cozy, friendly place in the mountain town of Frisco? Who knew their seaweed salad would have verged on ambrosial? Who knew the $6 tuna bowl would arrive in the form of a mountain of chopped, spiced tuna on rice? Who knew my family of four could stretch out in a private room, where we — shoeless — sat on pillows before a low table and watched the people down below, at the bar and in the main restaurant, inhale plates of yellowtail and salmon rolls? Who knew the restaurant ran its happy hour, which coincided with the closing of the nearby resorts, on weekends?

A: Portland General Electric has 34 spent nuclear fuel rods in dry cask storage at the former reactor site, shut in 1993. After allowing the rods to cool for 10 years in a pond, PGE enclosed them in steel canisters, which in turn are encased in concrete casks with walls 29 inches thick. The casks are designed to be transported to a permanent federal repository when and if one opens. In the meantime, they sit on a reinforced concrete pad at the site. The casks are vented to allow fresh air to pass between the concrete and steel liner, drawing away heat. Unlike fuel at the Japanese reactors, they require no electric power for cooling. The company says the cask and site are designed to withstand the kind of 9.0 subduction zone quake that struck Japan, as well as a more localized earthquake on the neighboring fault line. The Trojan site is 72 miles from the mouth of the Columbia River, far enough to avoid tsunami destruction. The company said the site was also designed to withstand flooding from upriver. In the event the casks were breached, the cleanup "would be a local, on-site event, not a widespread issue" a spokesman said.

The odors have driven some residents from the communities where these CAFOs are located, mostly in the northern part of the state.

Victoria Livingston-Hall echoes the overstatement with over-the-top gowns that are distracting and unflattering, though her Bulgarian military outfits are pretty funny.

We may detract from the lux environment, but the public still adds value, by caring. So though commerce has decreed no show this spring (take heart, there's a new art expo set for Navy Pier in September), we can hold our own virtual Art Chicago, and contemplate the show that isn't there. It reminds us that art adds decoration and ideas to life. Without it, life tends to subtract, as things slow down and fall away. Shows come and go. Art lasts.

The fourth installment of writer-director Robert Rodriguez's super-successful "Spy Kids" franchise is ostensibly a reboot, introducing two new youngsters who discover that their family has ties to a secret crime-fighting organization. But what was once a fun intersection of Rodriguez's DIY gumption and the anything-goes vibe of kids' movies has become tired and even desperate, as Rodriguez relies more and more on gross-out gags. Some of the wit and imagination of the first film persists, but not enough to recommend watching this "Spy Kids" over any of the ones that came before. The DVD/Blu-ray special features consist of deleted scenes, featurettes and a Rodriguez interview.

This week's announcement seems more like an election-year ploy to mollify critics furious over Obama's failure to recognize the gravity of the carp threat. These plankton predators are in the Chicago Area Waterway System that connects the Mississippi River to Lake Michigan.

He said he made the unpopular decision to block employees from transferring away from underserved communities, and he is exploring financial incentives to keep them there.

And the department is relying heavily on statistics to keep workers accountable and identify problems.
Kevin Gregg, who continued to be the subject of trade rumors, will likely also have some save opportunities as well. As long as Gregg, and his $5.8 million salary, is on the Orioles, he will get late-inning opportunities. Despite seven blown saves last year, he has experience closing games.

A three-man competition at second base will also factor. Should Tyler Greene emerge as the starter, lefthanded bats Skip Schumaker and Daniel Descalso would serve utility roles.

East Windsor’s council passed one last June affirming its desire to protect farmland and steer developers away from covering agricultural lands with industrial panels.
Perhaps inevitably, Parini, a professor of English, is more reliable in his literary assessments than on historical fact. He mistakenly places Thomas Jefferson -- actually in Paris on a diplomatic mission -- at the Constitutional Convention.

S Deon Grant. He’s been a very big help for us in the media this year, so from a personal standpoint, it’s nice to see a good guy rewarded after 12 years in the league. As for his game, he did the little things such as coming up to wrap up WR Wes Welker immediately on a short hook instead of allowing YAC (10:33 a.m. UPDATE Forgot to add in the initial entry here that Welker had a 16-yard YAC after his first catch but then only 1, 2, 3, 0, 2 and 4 yards on final six receptions) and darting forward into traffic to contain the same run as the 17-yard pitch play I just mentioned.

Far from being a drag on the event, the unexpected news of the Bristol Palin pregnancy was a gift, both to the party and to the press. It turned a spotlight on a favorite Republican enemy: "the media," which were castigated, a little more than they deserved, for making a story out of a story.
