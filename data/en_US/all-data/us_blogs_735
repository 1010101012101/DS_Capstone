She tells us about instances of differences with parents in the past. When it rained some parents wanted the children to stay inside and learn English, this wasn't felt to be supporting the ethos of the project and "it is this sort of non agreement within a cooperative which makes projects stuck." The pedagogues felt frustrated as their expertise wasn't being valued in this decision making process.When the project originally set up some parents could not deal with all the mud and because the project was working as a cooperative the project split into two.
We all want the best for ourselves, and for our family. But what about after, when you’re no more? What about then, huh? Will anybody remember you? Will they lament your loss?
I have put together a few decoration ideas for Halloween to inspire you to create your own. Most of these are past year's inspiration from Pottery barn, and some simple diy too. Get your creative juices flowing and let the craziness begin :))

The issue of security payments in the Internet is gradually losing its relevance. Financial data is encoded with 128-bit key, the system of financial security servers strengthened, so that the cause for excitement is running out.
Second: Judeo-Christianity ascribes holiness to a foreign political state, Israel, as though it was itself a god. It placed political Israel on the throne along side of Jesus Christ, and, in so doing, its teachers ignore, if not annul, much of Jesus’ teachings. (1) (2) (3)
The original plan for the image changed, and I'm happy we went with this other concept instead. I like the mix of vector art and real elements, plus the historical mesh feel of this is awesome if you ask me. And yes, this is yet another print screen, it's sexy admit it :D
"The tactical execution of Eager Lion 2012 exercise will officially start on May 15," Major Robert Bockholt, public affairs officer at Special Operations Command Central, told AFP.

‘I told you,’ Sam insisted, looking down, ‘I remember perfectly,’ then away. A tall redhead in a revealing, low-cut dress was talking to Ray and Melinda at the snacks table. Maybe he’d go sample the dip too.
Do you see the problem? Ah, yes, Mr Miyagi. The mice are caught, true, but they're still alive. Which means my mother and sister are now the Chief Operating Officers of a rather elaborate catch and release program, which doesn't really do much for the mice problem which started all this. You don't get rid of the mice, you just make them very late for something.
Met Monday @ Between Naps on the Porch
I tried brewing a really big double IPA. It wasn't that great. I used a bit to much sugar in comparison with the other fermentables. After some research, I realized that when making these big beers I should plan on a lower mash efficiency. This is because I am a batch sparger and use a 9 gallon cooler for a mash tun. I always sparge just enough liquor to get the correct preboil volume. And herin lies the problem, with the bigger beers, I don't get a full rinse of the mash like I do on normal sized beers. On my next double IPA attempt I will plan on a lower efficiency and use a bit less sugar as well.
First up, THE LOST PRINCE. Ethan is not a toddler anymore:
I managed to create some brushes thanks to a YouTube link from Petra and a Seeing to pictures post from Adrian. However I had difficulty creating a standard size brush for both cropped and uncropped images which Adrian answered personally but I couldn't understand why this didn't work. I asked a question in a Forum to which it took several replies to ascertain that my elements page had been corrupted in some way and it was unfortunate that he spoke a different computer language to me !! As I had spent too much of the month on this issue, I had a desire to sample other features of Elements ...
So I'm five stories into The Axiom Few's world and I'm wondering whether to flesh out the canon with more short stories or press on with a novel. A novel, as I said before, would be a big undertaking and I have a few ideas for it, but I don't want to undermine the format of the short stories which seems to work so well. I rather like the idea of constructing the whole canvas (back story and all) in a collection of short stories that fit together as puzzle pieces, rather like they are beginning to now. Other ideas have crossed my mind, such as creating an Axiom Few blog with running, serialised entries by Geek and Archer. How does that sound?
We've all heard of the K.I.S.S. method for products and processes (Keep It Simple Stup...). I think the pricing structure for the National needs some adjustments. Right now, just to walk in the door to the National you have to choose:

So I'm at the dawn of Day 3 and whilst the little guy has finally given up banging and is now sobbing quietly in a corner, the remains of his work are still with me. My head feels tender from the inside out. And I wasn't a big coffee drinker at all. One, maybe two at the most, per day. Oh, and a cup of tea in the morning. I don't drink coke or any of those hellishly nasty 'energy' drinks (poison in a can, really) so that only totals a maximum of 3 doses of caffeine per day. I cannot imagine what the poor souls who drink more than that go through, should they ever go cold turkey.
DragonCon: For those who've never been, it's basically Nerdi Gras in downtown Atlanta. Pop culture celebrities and fans attend, the latter dress up in elaborate costumes, and everyone dranks and giggles. The big trend o' the year was steampunk everything, and nothing quite working out how I wanted it to with the exception of some excellent peanut butter sandwiches. I have no pictures! Except of how someone modded the elevator buttons in the Marriott Marquis:
Butler explains that her own experience from being picked on in school is what motivated her to start this petition.
He tells us how he has had a restless night with no sleep. He has had a fever, but after his wife prayed for him, the fever has left him. He tells us that he is tired, but must fight the war. After 2 hours he is visibly exhausted and after praise and worship we make our way back, slowly, between 200 000 men. No sooner do we reach out tent when a marshal rushes over with the news that we are needed urgently at the main stage for a patient who had collapsed. We make our way back through the endless crowds, eventually reaching the stage, only to find one of our ambulances already there.
“The heart of PayPal is small business,” Peter Karpas, North American VP of customer engagement told Mashable. “The lines between online and offline and mobile are totally blurring for them. This comprehensive revamp of our products allows small businesses to get paid however they do business.”
And don’t try to state your use of h.o. is anything other than an explainable way to insult her.. I’ve come to know how you think, so don’t try selling your brand of crazy to me. I’m not buying. There’s a song I would dedicate to you. Perhaps you’ll remember it from the past, and come to appreciate it even more in the future. It was “I WILL FOLLOW HIM”. Just change the HIM to YOU! You may leave now. You’re dismissed!
In all cases, though, these books offer further evidence of an irresistible popular urge to discuss the future, and to do so through what can very broadly described as fiction. The recent speculative tone taken by much of today's architecture writing is only part of this trend; from "design fiction" to speculative foreign policy blogs, and from "the world without us" to future food, a compulsion to understand what might happen to human civilization, in both the near and distant future, using fictional scenarios and speculative hypotheses seems to be at a high point of trans-disciplinary appeal.
This weekend I attended a masterclass with an amazingly talented woman, which both excited and terrified me - how exciting to spend a day focused on something I loved, how terrifying that I may discover I am not 'the best' at what I want to do.
To the citizen’s of Barrow Burrow, perception of their world differed substantially from that of those species that relied upon the dictatorship of sight; on unobstructed straight line transmission of information through lenticular organizers into the neural apparatus governing the essential awareness necessary for the survival of most living things. Those living in Barrow Burrow and those in other burrows “saw” instead, a web of impressions unaffected by those mere physical impediments that obstruct one’s line of sight; much like those Polynesians “saw” the islands beyond the horizon.
1) Acid or alkaline foods, meaning how much acid or alkaline the foods contain.
Some time ago, we were fancy over a local vegetarian restaurant's one-plate meal. However, their food quality have deteriorated over time. Hence, we no longer dine in the vegetarian restaurant. According to my previous dine in experience, I used to order their one-plate meal with rice, vegetarian curry mutton, and some veggies.
Sleeping Beauty Castle in the California and Hong Kong Disneyland parks is inspired by Germany's Neuschwanstein Castle.
This scene also serves as a pattern for Marian intercession. Just as Mary at Cana noticed the family’s needs before anyone else did, so Mary in heaven continues to notice our needs before we do. And just as Mary at Cana brought those needs to Christ, so does she continue to bring our needs to her Son through her intercession for us. In Redemptoris Mater, John Paul II wrote that this scene at Cana exemplifies “Mary’s solicitude for human beings, her coming to them in the wide variety of their wants and needs.” He continues:
It isn’t. In fact the new album, Blueprint, is one of the best things I have heard this year. As when Steely Dan came back after 20 years between albums, Blueprint sounds as if Sebastian Hardie never took a breath in those 36 years. From the sea-wash Hammond organ and cello-like guitar of 6/8 opener ‘I Wish’ through thrill-ride ‘Vuja De’, down to orchestral closer ‘Shame’, the entire album is a delight. Majestic, spacey, classically beautiful by turns, it is everything I expected.
Chandelier crystal clips earrings, Beaded purses, delicately stripped sandals, fur coats are all a must in your retro wardrobe. Hair and makeup!!! Guys in the 80’s wore their hair greased and slicked back. Gals wore heavy duty mascara and red lipstick. Go for styles you feel comfortable in. guys you don’t have to look Miami Vice and gals don’t try so hard.
Which I think, perhaps, is finally the point of this post. I am afraid to open myself up and say I am tender, I am soft, I have a happysadness, because that is not cool or smart, and there is no protection there. But what do I have to protect? I am not so cool and smart, I am just a girl. I like flowers, I like poetry, I like the words "kiss" and "touch" and "pink". Perhaps I am coming into who I am again, and this time soft and on cat feet. If one is lonely, one must let others in. So simple and so frightening.
And each member of the aforementioned Fantastic Four was an idiot. So, what did we do? We laughed. We laughed hard.
Or, as Richard said to me: “Underneath the silliness and twatdom it’s a very important issue”.
Our service was a little odd. Not only did the servers keep bringing plates and left them to pile up on our tiny two top, there was a large noticeable piece of white fuzz in the ketchup that was served with my giant cone of fries. It wasn't small or difficult to see. Rather, it was like a white fuzzy eye staring at us from dark red ketchup. I'm at a loss as to how to wait staff could have missed it, especially since I kept staring at it when they walked by as I tried to get their attention. It was as if they deliberately pretended it wasn't there. Perhaps none of them knew how to approach the situation, or perhaps they hoped I hadn't noticed it. In any case, it was odd to say the least.
She said the law should have enable more vigorous checks to be carried out on youngsters needing foster care.
Okay FINE then. She could tell me what I need to do and then stand in the doorway and watch because if she came anywhere NEAR me I was going to deck her ... believe that! I guess they took me at my word because a few minutes later there was a knock on my door. I looked up and there, stopped at the door mind you, are two of the biggest, baddest, bouncer looking fellas I'd ever laid eyes on ... dressed in white coats. I'm telling you they were both at least three feet wide at the shoulders.

With so much time before August, we’re still formulating ways to have a meaningful day. For certain, we’ll get ready together instead of separately. As part of that, I’ve decided to wear contacts, which makes me nervous in a good way. It will mark the first time since high school that I have ventured out without hiding behind the safe comfort of my glasses. I wanted to step into the world that day as a new person, as I know that’s how I will feel.
97% of the population of Kattowice/Kattowitz were frightened enough to claim that they were really Germans - but the Nazis ignored these assertions, and made their own division into Germans; ethnic Germans who hadn't asserted their German nationality before the invasion; persons of indeterminate origin, and Poles who hadn't been 'anti-German.' It was bad luck to be in the 'indeterminate' category. Worse luck to be Jewish, of course. But the horrors of the German occupation of Eastern Europe are well-known. Auschwitz moved into its dreadful place in history. There's something else, that I only found out recently, which is that throughout Silesia monuments and inscriptions that related to the Piast duchy of the past were erased during the Nazi period.
I wanted to start with these lovely little poppers because they combine the two treats for my ideal Mother's Day activity: popcorn and M&M's. I've yet to make these, but I'm so excited for our next movie night so we can test them out!

Sorry guys, this is not an Imperial Stout. What it is though is one hell of an interesting and tasty beer! I'm not sure you'll ever be able to replace and recreate those full on flavours which come about from the darker malts but It's full on in flavour and complexity. Lots of coco nibs, you can tell there's a decent amount of hop bitterness under quite a bit of chocolate smoothness. The smoky nose comes into play quite a bit with the flavour, but it's nothing bad. Marshmellow, caramel and vanilla, sweet bonfire toffee, orange rind, a little sticky pine and a lot of complex complexity!
P.S. – According to the late, great Winston Churchill the answer is never.
With both James and his partner Christina being regarded as two of our nation’s most dedicated, intelligent and committed nationalists, we know the pair of them will make a formidable team for the British Freedom Party.
I try to combine my shopping and errand trips all in one day. We live out from town, so a trip in usually takes 15-30 minutes depending on where we are going. During the school year our "town day" is on Tuesday which is when we have piano lessons, so we also do our library stop, health food store, Sam's and grocery store run all on the same day. This means I must be prepared with lists of needed items, but it is a great help to get it all done in one day. During the summer we don't have piano lessons and we drop the library stops. (we have MANY books at home) I am then able to make a shopping trip every 2-3 weeks instead.
My band. Marti the violinist. Martha the recorder/whistle player. Sam The Drummer. They have such musical intelligence and sensitivity, and I'm so honored that they share it with me. Tonight they sat through one of those set list adjustments and gave great advice (the homemade rose liqueur I plied them with helped, no doubt).
8. Fundamentalist Religion and Fundamentalist Consumerism. American culture offers young Americans the “choices” of fundamentalist religion and fundamentalist consumerism. All varieties of fundamentalism narrow one’s focus and inhibit critical thinking. While some progressives are fond of calling fundamentalist religion the “opiate of the masses,” they too often neglect the pacifying nature of America’s other major fundamentalism. Fundamentalist consumerism pacifies young Americans in a variety of ways. Fundamentalist consumerism destroys self-reliance, creating people who feel completely dependent on others and who are thus more likely to turn over decision-making power to authorities, the precise mind-set that the ruling elite loves to see. A fundamentalist consumer culture legitimizes advertising, propaganda, and all kinds of manipulations, including lies; and when a society gives legitimacy to lies and manipulativeness, it destroys the capacity of people to trust one another and form democratic movements. Fundamentalist consumerism also promotes self-absorption, which makes it difficult for the solidarity necessary for democratic movements.

Whistle Bait by Larry Collins
Indian Placement Program: An organized effort begun in 1947 to take Native Americans from the reservations and place them with white Mormon families, in the hope that they would assimilate into the broader American and Mormon society. Early efforts were quite successful, as apostle Spencer Kimball reported in 1960 that “children in the home placement program in Utah are often lighter than their brothers and sisters in the hogans on the reservation,” with one girl reportedly “several shades lighter than her parents.” Despite promising signs that Native Americans were “changing to whiteness and to delightsomeness,” the program had mixed results and was discontinued entirely in 1996.
From the part of the mechanical time we are thinking about the design of the probes. Firstly about how to make the ribs more durable by co-curing the ribs when we are manufacturing then or adding then lately in the process by curing with the same epoxy. Secondly we are trying to figure out why our hemispheres do not keep the shape and hot discussions have been held about this topic but not clear solution has come to this problem so far. Therefore we are trying to design the lay up in a way that force the hemisphere to keep it shape by co-curing a inner ring to the hemisphere. As you can see co-curing is an option that is coming to us so here you are an illustration of what is it. It is basically to cure two components made composite by curing then together so they get a perfect fit.
For sprouting, I normally soak it for 24-36 hours minimum exchanging water 3 times (every 12 hours). Then drain it for 5 minutes. Knot this in a muslin cloth (or any thin kitchen towel). Keep it on the table and cover it with a wooden basket (or any plastic one with holes) – I mean cover it ¾ only. After 12 hours start sprinkling water to keep it moist. Any hard dhals can be sprouted like this. But moong dhal doesn’t take much time to sprout. By this way you increase the protein content of dhals.

I tune out the shocked gasp and the clatter of the metal rods the driver had been carrying against the ground and against each other. I slowly open my eyes and see the cave I made with my own two hands. However, because of the fresh separation of stone from earth, it is not encrusted and damp. Fresh clean soil lines the wall of the cave free of animal urine and fecal matter.

Michael Robinson’s Old Ale: An English-style beer with notes of dried fruit, nuts and caramel brewed with five different malts. Light brown and full bodied with a slight bitterness, the ingredients are all-American except for the yeast. At 9% abv, it’s a bit bigger than the average beer, designed for cooler nights or after-dinner sipping.

I hardly believe that it will be in the public’s interest and I guarantee that First Nations traditional and ecological rights will not be included in the development of any data created by COSIA. Once again a platform is being developed that exclude our people, our rights and our knowledge out of the bigger picture and gives the power to the very people who are oppressing us.

I remember a young man five houses down who taught me the greatest snowball fight trick ever devised. I remember trying to get baseballs out of our neighbors flower bed before they noticed and took them away. I remember the cranky man down the street stopping me on my paper route to talk about boxing matches. I remember a thousand things, few of them especially wonderful when repeated, all of them wonderful in my memory.

Why bother replacing folding tables that already worked fine? Folding tables always have those bars below that hook into the middle of the table for stability. These bars prevent you from using the full space below the table properly for storage.

Here’s what happened…. I saw a bulletin board announcement about Disney coming and recruiting for their culinary externship program and thought it sounded like something I MIGHT be interested. I talked it over with Ty and the boys (who are so incredibly supportive) and decided to fill out the online app so that I could talk to a rep when they came to the school. I had a couple of concerns about my age and lack of kitchen experience so if any of that disqualified me from employment, I wanted to know. I was quite honest about all of that on my application. A few days later, I received an email asking me to set up a phone interview instead of waiting until they came to recruit on campus. I’m pretty sure this has a lot to do with my being an alumni of the college program (from 1989!). I did the phone interview and felt good about it. I get the whole Disney thing. I know what they look for. Truth is, I was expecting and offer. On Tuesday of this week, that offer came. I (again) talked it over with Ty and with his blessing, nay, his encouragement, I accepted the offer.
In a broad Moscow street not two hundred yards from the Leningrad station, on the upper floor of an ornate and hideous hotel built by Stalin in the style known to Muscovites as Empire During the Plague, the British Council's first ever audio fair for the teaching of the English language and the spread of British culture was grinding to its excruciating end. The time was half past five, the summer weather erratic. After fierce rain showers all day long, a false sunlight was blazing in the puddles and raising vapour from the pavements. Of the passers-by, the younger ones wore jeans and sneakers, but their elders were still huddled in their warms.

Our first stop today was a Solidarity credit meeting. Solidarity is the third rung on the Fonkoze ladder and a core part of the Grameen model of micro-lending. Women, often from the same village, organize themselves into groups of five members, and take out individual loans. That group then joins with other groups of five, and the lot of them form a Credit Center. Now a whole community of villages is involved and people are not only responsible for themselves, but they can rely on and help their peers. Solidarity.
But seriously folks, what is so hard about arriving on time? Nay, arriving at all?! OK, OK, I'll be the first to admit that I have been as offensive in this area as the very bodies to which I refer. Even during my time in San Francisco I was comfortably late to some meetings, spot on time to others. Since moving to the East, where time is short and patience shorter, I have developed an as of yet undiscovered sensitivity to Time Respect.
The flourishes and chanting of enhanced spell craft is completely useless, but I do it anyway.

I have had a very hard time introducing concepts based assessment (aka standards based grading) to my Year 11 General Maths class this year. I have always tried to teach concepts and so assessing this way was a very good fit. I’ve also tried to emulate some of Dan Meyer’s “be less helpful” ideas. To say it’s been a tough task would be an understatement.

HSUS derives many benefits from people thinking they operate local animal shelters. They have a lot of credibility based on that perception. People want to believe the words they write. Sending them in to lie to their Congressman is a terribly dishonest move.
Yet, the hour grows late and light diminishes as it leaves this “city.” Boston minister Jonathan Mayhew’s (1720-1766) words ring out from before it’s founding to warn us that, “people are not usually deprived of their liberties all at once, but gradually, by one encroachment after another, as it is found they are disposed to bear them.” With shameful regard, natural rights are denied and replaced by the “positive laws” of man that believe in no absolute guarantee of liberties…simply the musings of congressmen and professors on paper.

I had a couple of things I could blog about but I felt like I should talk about this one first. There are, in the world, basically 2 ideas about storing food for a year. One, the "old fashioned" way with #10 cans of whole foods like wheat, beans, rice, etc. The other is commonly called "storing what you eat" meaning storing regular grocery foods that you use everyday.
Opposing such a bill in the collegial and newly Republican Senate was futile, but the House Judiciary Committee offered a forum that would look more closely at the change the measure implied for property rights. This idea of “condemnation on demand” was not a high visibility issue, and there was no groundswell against it since the idea was not widely known. The opposition alliance’s “legislative inside baseball” strategy was to first get it assigned to the House Judiciary Committee then to focus arguments on “protecting private property rights”—something all legislators reflexively support.

QUOTES OF THE WEEK
Plotwise the thing is a sprawling mess. We acknowledge that this is Epic theatre, with its own requirements. But even Brecht (who had encouraged Blitzstein in the project) had grappled with (and mostly solved) the problem of presenting large historical movements on stage, generally by making some concessions to traditional taste. We know, for example, that the heroine of St. Joan of the Stockyards is…St. Joan. The closest thing to a hero in The Cradle is one Larry Foreman (Josh Powell), who doesn’t emerge until the second act, mostly to confront Mr. Mister about the workplace death of one Joe Worker. Yes: Joe Worker. Before this, we have been exposed to the systematic corruption to a group of community leaders who now form a “Liberty Committee”, and the framing of a Polish immigrant for an anarchist bombing. To tie it all together at the end, we are directly addressed by the cast, Waiting for Lefty style, to go out and change things. In the manner of whom? Mao, Castro, Pol Pot? Jimmy Hoffa? Are those unfair examples? What about depicting all businessmen as ruthless robber barons?
Chancellor Osborne’s VAT rise in 2011 may have helped slow GDP growth due to its effect on household consumption but in 2012, its inflationary effects will wane and should help reduce the budget deficit.
All the holes for mounting new attachements, gear, and accessories are threaded. This is great because it makes mounting anything a cinch. This is not great because I’ll need to keep tightening things with more kilometers; road vibes mean screws without locknuts loosen up. I’d hate to loose, oh, let’s say a pannier rack while I’m riding; pannier rack and fender jam into my spokes, lock my tire, and there goes my face and shoulder.

This month I wanted to share a few liability lawsuits. These cases are either making their way through the courts, or may have already been adjudicated. I believe your reaction will be the same as mine in most cases. That is, “Are You Kidding Me”? I wonder how they ever even make it to the courts.

I only have two more days of this 31 for 21 challenge and I'm not feeling inspired. I have lots of random thoughts but no really complete thoughts running through my mind. Its been a rough week and its finally Friday. I am ready to take my glass of wine and veg in front of the TV. I'm hoping a good night's sleep and waking up knowing I get to spend the entire day with the boys will help shake this funk I'm in.
And because Waste Land a film about all of this and more, it is a great film indeed. What begins as an interesting experiment, turning garbage into art, becomes a sociological study of the transformative power of art on people, and of people on the art and the artist. Waste Land shows us how people can be bound together through work and art, not only to each other, but also to their larger socio-political and historical legacy. It is a film about the ways humanity and beauty can be found, thrive even, in the most challenging and unlikely places, when people have the resolve, and the love, to make it so. Most importantly perhaps, is the fact that Waste Land is a real treasure, the sort of heartwarming and life affirming study of people, lacking in both sentimentality and cynicism, that uplifts the audience and elevates the art form.
So in talking about these two types of knowledge, we can turn to Christianity and American Christians and ask what sort of knowledge do many of us have about Christianity? Based on my own experience growing up in the church, the stories of many of my friends and the books I’ve read, I’d suggest that for many of us, our knowledge is of the former category. We know – and know quite well – that Jesus died on the cross for our sins and that if we believe in him we’ll have eternal life. We know the core facts – and it’s good that we do. But I wonder, do we see all of life the way that Jesus saw it? Or even the way the majority of Christians historically have seen it? Has it shaped us to such a fundamental, foundational level that it informs every aspect of our lives? Just to be clear: I’m not talking about some sort of higher knowledge acquired by the super-spiritual which makes them somehow superior to the junior varsity carnal Christians. Rather, I’m trying to say that a necessary part of Christian maturity is not simply that our behavior would conform more and more to the norms of the Gospel, but that our entire way of conceptualizing creation will be as well.

Then one day, about a year ago, I happened to be perusing the magazine rack at my local (dreaded) WalMart. I picked up a publication with which I was not familiar called Taste of the South. It was a thin magazine, but the pics were glossy and pretty, and the food looked tasty, so I gave it a good thumbing through. The featured Southern city that month was Memphis, so I paused to take a closer look. One of the pages featured a brief write-up regarding The Peabody Hotel. I was familiar with this hotel from a previous visit to Memphis many moons ago, so I paused to read it. Low and behold, there it was. A recipe for Tres Leches Cake shared by the chef of the fancy schmancy restaurant located in the hotel, Chez Philippe. I glanced through it and it looked pretty solid, so I bought the magazine and took it home to give the recipe a test ride. The only component that seemed to require a bit of effort was a sabayon sauce. Something with which I was not familiar.

Robert Griffin III (QB Baylor)- We featured Griffin in a post about the best QBs in the NCAA. He certainly lived up to the hype in his school-best upset as Baylor defeated TCU on national television Friday night. Now the key debate for RGIII is not WILL he play in the NFL, it is “what” will he play. Is he a proven QB (ala Mike Vick) or an athlete, better suited to use his speed as a WR.

Until I Die is a story that treads softly, most of the story almost eerily quiet as the enemies of the Revenants decide to lay low and regroup after the events at the end of Die For Me, but the quiet is not a light one, instead each page of relative inaction is another weight laid upon our shoulders as we wait for the moment when noise is going to violently disrupt our comfortable calm. Because there is so little action for majority of the book, it does take us a while to settle back into this very unique world, our driving desire to learn more about a fresh and new group of paranormals stalled by a thick, almost viscous haze of pleasantness that prevents us from digging as deep as we’d like. We seem to tiptoe around anything overly emotional or physically taxing, stepping carefully page after page all the while hoping for something big to happen yank us into the story.

In order to understand PJAM, you have to understand what I was like back then. I was a weird kid, and I pretty much didn’t understand the whole friendship thing. I didn’t understand why people made friends in school. I was like, I go to school to learn, not to have friends. Besides, I already had lots of friends, and they were my cousins. Erika, Erinn, Eroll, Erijah, Era, and Annika lived next door, so I had enough playmates. My mom would tell me, Why don’t you go out and play with the neighbors? I would say Ma, I don’t have to befriend the world. I didn’t think I was shy. I just didn’t get the friends thing. I mean if you already had six playmates, why do you need more? It was like friendship gluttony. People interpreted my behavior as shyness and that label stuck. I became shy even if I really wasn’t.

How About Orange always has tons of great ideas and I usually stop here first when I am blog hopping.This trash bag decorating idea just blew me away. I love cheap and I love easy....and well that sounds odd because I am not either.....well haha maybe I am after all. But I have to admit this idea looks great and I will give it a try for the party. We are going to set up a haunted path though a little wooded area for the little ones,so I may use white trash bags so they will show up. After all it really wouldn't be Halloween if we adults can't scare the kids a little bit.....I'm just kidding....or am I? Mooohahaha!!
I have not danced since Saturday due to the aforementioned issues with breathing, and I think I am not going to push myself tonight, but tomorrow I will be revisiting Sueno Porteno in Bodeo. I went last week with two chicas and we had a grand time. It is a traditional milonga, but with a relaxed twist. Everyone is seated together, no separation of men and women, and it is acceptable to approach someone for a dance. Cabeceo is also used, but not as much because there are three dance floors and the seating is sort of wrapped around the center stair case, which is enclosed. Yes, three dance floors, all on the same level. Two of them are really connected by a short divider in the middle of the floor, and the third is sort of over in Timbuktu, but it seems to be a safe place to go if you (meaning a leader) want to do some more athletic moves (boleos, volcadas, etc) that one would not normally lead in a traditional dance floor. I had some fantastic dances and really enjoyed being with my two friends. So if you are interested in a relazed, traditional atmosphere, this seems to be the ideal place to go.

I got that a lot when I moved to Australia nearly seven years ago. Last week in Paris, a shop owner mistook me for a Brazilian or Mexican. When I said I was Australian, I got puzzled looks. Then I said I was originally from the Philippines. And then it sort of made sense to them but they wondered why I didn’t look Chinese. (Yeah, Asian generalisation right there.)

水曜日と木曜日にブログをアップするのを飛ばしちゃいましたね？言い訳知りたいですか？最近夫と一緒に朝ジョギングを始めました。ちなみに、私は走るのが大の苦手。私が走っている姿は、ペンギンが走ろうとしているような感じです。夫は仕事に行く前にジョギングをよくしていたので、私は最近になって一緒にするようになりました。最近は私の中には存在しなかった朝早い時間に起きています。人がまだ寝ている時間にジョギングする方が好きですね。朝一番に終わらせてしまえるのも嬉しいです。それなので、午後10時半になると、就寝してしまいます。そのため、就寝前にブログをする時間が減ってしまいました。以前は私の座っていたお尻のマークがある場所にずっと座ってブログ三昧だったのですが。今はもう一つ優先する事が増えました。

Is it really that good? Do you find with ”as seen on tv” products that there is a slight whiff of “if it seems too good to be true, then it probably is”? They always seem that way to me. But they sure look useful. Or as they say in this version of the commercial here: ”This is one time it is ok to put all your eggs in one basket. – Indeed.

now i know that when i write like this, i make myself fairly open to accusations of cynicism, bitterness and excessive anger, but you see, i think my way is freeing: things are the way they are, i need to be the best that i can be in the face of this (and boy, do i fail spectacularly), i need to sift the good from the bad and shape it into meaning myself, and if i fail, i need to take the responsibility squarely onto my own shoulders and not blame society, my low self esteem or worse, some ridiculous deity for trying to teach me something that if i have an ounce of imagination, i can figure out for myself.

I searched and searched for the perfect baskets to fit the changing table… There are baskets sold everywhere, but they were either to small or too big…or not tall enough or deep enough. If I found ones that I liked, there wasn’t four identical!! Finally I found these as A.C. Moore. They were a little pricey, but I had to get them… not only were they the perfect size, they matched the color of the nursery chair exactly!
I’ve had him for over 18 years, my adult life. I got him shortly after I moved on my own (guess I’m dating myself a little bit here). He’s been a major part of my life and best friend for so long that him not being here is going to leave a huge hole in our family. I honestly feel like my heart is breaking, and that I’m killing my dog. But it’s not fair to him to keep him around for me and allow him to get to a point where he’d be suffering. So tonight is my last night with him, and I will be preparing for him a nice steak dinner.
Selecting a suitable lover for the queen would have been a challenging yet rewarding assignment. Would Richard Gere, the American gigolo, have been the right type of gallant to loosen her corset strings and caress the inhibitions from body? No, he was too vain and mercenary. What the queen really needed was to be idolised by a fancy boy who would have gurgled with gratitude every time she curtsied on his face. A job, I feel, for a fervent little Frenchman in the Charles Aznavour mould – an Energizer Bunny of Love who would have taken pride in being the queen’s official sex toy.

This weekend I am giving a Bridal Shower at my house for one of my surrogate brother's fiancée. My brother has two best friends, Gabe and Billy. They have been best friends since they were little and have always been apart of our family going on family vacations, Thanksgivings, Christmases you name it our door was always open. This is the first non-family event I've had at my house and it's sort of forcing me to actually DO things to my house to make it look lived in. I bought new chairs for our kitchen and drapes for the living room. I've hired a maid to come in and start cleaning once a month (which I really needed especially for the bathroom...I really hate cleaning the bathroom). So I'm hoping that this will start a trend and I'll really get my house "lived in". Ideally I would like to paint...but that is so darn messy, plus I know me...I would get sick of it eventually and want to change it...I'll do it eventually...all the walls are just so beige now. Hmmm.
While I'm experiencing the very weird mix of excitement and grief, I realize what a unique and frustrating place it has put me in. I find myself holding back happiness so I don't appear too excited about my wedding, because people then think it means I'm over Jeremy, that I'm done grieving, or I'm being disrespectful in some way. On the flip side, I worry that if I show my grief too strongly or talk about it too much, people accuse me of not being ready to get married or not being in a good place. It's my catch 22.
I never usually eat before I head out the door for a workout, but today I actually woke up famished!

As I waited in the lobby of the Hartford Health Collective for my regular check up, I read on my phone the many comments that people posted in a very short time. I appreciated the directness and the clarity of many of the comments as well as the willingness of some people to share their experiences, perhaps in hopes that narrative will help some people like Ron to “get it.” I have found many transgender people like Abby express themselves brilliantly and advocate for themselves expertly. Mercedes Allen, a bisexual transsexual in a lesbian relationship who contributes to Bilerico Project wrote a post in response Thank You For Flying Bilerio Airlines and provides links to other responses. Even so, everyone benefits from allies. I was glad to see some non-trans (cisgender) folks also comment to denounce the post and announce their support of transgender people.

Numerous writers have embraced e-book technology as a way to independently publish their books, reach new markets, and earn greater royalties for their work. Retail giant Amazon has long dominated the market for authors looking to self-publish their e-books, but it has quickly been followed by other e-book publishers, such as Smashwords, Lulu, and BookBaby.

And now, here I am: forty years old and totally creatively withered. The absence of any real inspiration or creative challenges and outlets in my life has made an internal environment where depression grows like kudzu, wrapping itself around and slowly strangling me. My biggest fear is that I actually AM too old to be what I might have been and the only things I have to look forward to are numbness and regret.

*Find a used homeschool bookstore withing driving distance, make a list of what you couldn't get for free, by swapping, or borrowing, and plan a day trip. Even if the store is a few hours away, if you wind up your purchases for the year (and maybe plan a bit of sightseeing...field trip!) it will be worth the gas it cost to get there. This is the place to go if you just can't make a decision about what curricula you DO want to spend your money on. Leave the kids with a sitter (barter your time) and browse to your heart's content. Just make sure you stick to your budget and plan because it is easy to see SO MANY things that are just such good bargains it almost seems a shame to pass them up. Believe me, I know. If you really have it together, you might even be able to take some of your old, unwanted books to sell and get store credits to use on "new" stuff.

My wife went with the scrambled eggs with black truffle and toasted baguette (pictured at the top of this post). I tried some of her entree, and it was great. The eggs were a really simple preparation (creamy, almost “soupy” French-style scrambled eggs) with undertones of truffle. The simplicity of the dish really allowed the truffle to come through, and the creamy eggs went well with the crunchy toasted baguette. I definitely had some entree envy.

What would have been the greater joy? Receiving a resurrected Lazarus back from the grave or having him healed before he entered the grave? The only response we know of is that Jesus really made a lot of people angry with this stunt and some others put their faith in him.

As a whole, the adults in this story are villainous and the children are the virtuous victims, with the exception of one adult character, the simple minded guard Mo (with his pet cat Lefty) - who is far more like any child than a grown up man. He's a kindred soul who puts the needs of others far above his own, especially when it comes to children, for he had a sister once, "but that's a whole different story".

3. Give people the help they need to spread the word about you. Develop a robust online presence starting with a compelling website. People will search for you online—what they find needs to match what others are saying about you. And, give your fans something they can share with others—an interesting article that can be downloaded from your website or a feature on your business’ Facebook page. Help your clients to send you viral. The key is to have something that is unique, let others know about it, and give them ways to share it with others. Without these, you may seem surprisingly unexceptional.

Misogynists make blanket assessments of women all the time because of the actions of a few or their personal prejudices against women.

I started the wide receiving core you see above and benched Brent Celek and Laurent Robinson. I originally had Celek in for Brandon Lloyd; however, I changed that decision a few hours ago when I read that Bradford has a better than 50% chance to start. Again, Brandon is a risky start given the St. Louis QB situation and Seattle's recent defensive dominance; however, I think Brandon has a chance to score more points than Celek. Refer to Part 1 of my fantasy football post to see why I am benching Laurent Robinson.

I loved looking at our shadows fall before us when Maki and I walked in the sun. I was over six feet tall and she barely reached five, and we looked like a parent and child. Years later it occurred to me that she had relied upon me to teach her English, the odd customs of the Santa Cruz hippie lifestyle, and even how to drive the VW.

If you know me any bit, you will know that I can really get into the details of each and everything if I wanted to.That reminds me of our wedding. I was a bridezilla. I went crazzzyy with details and still feel that I could have done a LOT better.I really feel sad for all those who were a part of that journey with me.I must have fought with every possible person who I came across to get those things done :-) I think everything would have been under control if we lived anywhere other than Kannur because sourcing anything is a big thing there :-) Whatever said and done, Kannur is my most favourite place on earth!!
Please don’t think I’m against competition. One team against another creates great competition. It encourages you to do your best work. But competition inside the team can only lead to destruction. You don’t know who to trust or what to believe. I spoke up against that, not competition on the whole.

Is this something that truckers get used to - this disconnection with normalcy and people? I suspect much like a physician needs to separate himself from a sick patient, a trucker would have to condition himself to deal with loneliness and being away from loved ones, all the while doing a job that gives you more than ample time to think about loneliness and loved ones. I cannot help but question what the fall out is to develop the ability to do such a thing, to compartmentalize the loneliness and missing. I see it in M, his ability to shut everything out but the job. It scares me. I asked him about this very thing. His reply, “It takes some getting used to, once you get used to it, you start to like it”. The man I love with all my heart likes being disconnected. It’s not an easy thing to accept.

movie was banned in several countries because of the gore. Even with the resistance, it grew a huge fan following, and spawned one official sequel and several others.

The past weekend both of my feet and legs have been bothering me. Weird sensations, sore and tingly arches, tight calves and hamstrings. I have been afraid to run for fear of bringing back my Plantar Faciitis - had it 2010 in Right foot and 2011 in Left. This fear has kept me from running.....which is stupid as I need to start my training for upcoming races.
My card uses the stamp set, Eco Chic by Unity Stamp Co. I stamped the tree, cut it out and colored it with Copic markers. Now don't get all excited, I don't have the coloring skills of Colleen, but hey -not many do! lol! I used green and blues colors in keeping with the colors of the Earth, and of course there are lots of Spellbinder die templates.
First a note to Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry. There's a point that your surrogates ought to be making - (with SuperPac deniability for you, of course!) Remind folks that New Hampshire is a Blue State. About as blue as they come. And hence, if the hybrid-type republicans of the Granite State prefer Mitt Romney... what does that say about him? Redmeat for red South Carolina.

In our latest installment of The Conversations, Jason Bellamy and I discuss the films of Alexander Payne, from his debut Citizen Ruth to his acclaimed, recently released The Descendants. We talk about Payne's satirical targets, his balance of comedy and drama, and the performances in his work. And of course we focus on what seems to be the big critical question regarding Payne: the debate over whether or not he's condescending towards the types of characters who frequently appear in his films.
I have just come back from a long weekend with my Father and on Sunday afternoon I took a drizzly, windy, but interesting walk around his garden. In his 80′s, Dad potters and controls what goes on but leaves the hard work to a gardener. The wide gravel path winds around the edge, with shrubs and trees on either side. They are lucky enough to have a bore hole in the garden which provides watering when required, so it always looks lush.
When we were taking them to the car, we realized they were full. My first thought was, "great, now we have someone's junk to throw away on top of hauling it all home. The homeowner told us they were full of pictures of homes from our county and all of the surrounding counties. She got busy with someone else, so we couldn't ask her why she took pictures of so many houses and filed them according to street name.

Thank you Kyle for being great. Love you.
Young people teaching other young people about healthy food is incredibly powerful. Where teachers and other adults sometimes sound hectoring, young people (often saying the same thing) sound cool. I teach creative writing to kids alongside student teachers and the connection the kids make to these teacher candidates is immediate and profound. The kids see themselves in the young teachers, and they work hard to impress them. I’m not saying adults have nothing to offer (or I’d just go hang up my hat!), just that young people supporting younger people can be a massive force for positive change.

From Tantalus himself, who stole ambrosia from Olympus and who most notably slaughtered and cooked his son Pelops to feed the gods, to Menelaus and Agamemnon, who besieged Troy for 10 years to recover the faithless Helen, this single family constitutes the DNA of what we think of as canonical western literature. The doings of Tantalus's descendents exercised, among countless others, Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and, later, Seneca. And through his influence on Jacobean and Elizabethan tragedy, and especially on Shakespeare, Seneca is arguably the biggest classical influence on English drama. What Hayloft presents isn't recognisably Shakespearean. It's not particularly Senecan, come to that. And yet its effect is surprisingly close to both: which I think is a result of a complexity of texture on the one hand, and a primitive, unforgiving harshness on the other.
As usual, I'm not trying to start any debates or upset anyone: I'm just sharing my views on things, and if they strike a chord with you, or make you think of things in a new way, or even if you just like hearing my perspective, then I'll be happy!

I am not a huge fan of making farewell cards because in so many cases I don't want to say goodbye to the recipient. This is true in this case too. My wonderful hair stylist recently informed me that he was moving to California! My first reaction was to cry out loud with a very audible: "nooooooooo!". I support him 100% in his new venture and I know he is going to do very very well but that does not mean that I am super happy about this news. I even justified his desertion with the comforting thought that I might be able to rub shoulders with the rich and famous (well not literally but if he cuts George's hair and he once cut mine - then George and I have a serious connection!!!!).

This has been a long summer of hotel rooms, from Las Cruces, New Mexico, to Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and an incredible range of interesting stories has passed by that I didn't have a chance to post.

In other words, you've probably already seen these—but they're worth the attention, nonetheless.

but there i stood in the middle of all this, listening to an earnest choir sing "oh freedom" followed by the raging grannies who warbled some revolutionary ditties with an equal earnestness and i suddenly felt completely disconnected. disconnected from this earnestness, this purity of feeling and hope, these ideals. don't get me wrong, i think it is time we got angry at the growing economic disparity and the ridiculous amount of power corporations have in politics, angry at what is essentially the dissolution of any kind of meaningful democracy, but i felt i no longer have it in me to think anything will change. i guess my cynicism got the better of me, but hey, i was one more body to be counted among the 99%.

MAC Eyeshadow’s in Omega, Blanc-Type, Bamboo, Vanilla, Wedge, Expresso, and Orb. The Naked Palette by Urban Decay (1 or 2) has some great color choices for nude eyes. Even if you choose not to go with this brand you can use the color suggestions as a gauge to buy by. Every cosmetic line has their own set of eye colors, and many companies make great eye makeup. Smashbox, Lancome, and Merle Norman are also good alternatives. So is Loreal, and Revlon.

...well, it turns out that I was able to extend my recent rush-line hot streak yesterday afternoon after all! Yes I'm serious, folks; I have a streak going. I waited on a rush line last fall to get into a free preview screening of Tsai Ming-liang's Face and eventually found myself in an audience witnessing the great Taiwanese iconoclast's latest exhilarating mad folly (one which needs a U.S. theatrical release pronto). And just last week, I found myself standing on a line at the Museum of Modern Art to see the new 35mm restoration of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's two-part 1973 sci-fi television film World on a Wire; I successfully got into that screening, too, and proceeded to have my mind blown repeatedly for over three-and-a-half hours.
Enoch explained the way to find the cause was like in medical science when trying to discover the cause of an epidemic: look for the common denominator.

I recently read the most horrendous book review that had me cringing on behalf of the author. My first reaction was sympathy towards this person because I know how I would have felt should my book have been so poorly reviewed. But when I read through it again, I realised that the reviewer was actually doing the author a favour; she was giving constructive criticism in the form of feedback. It was negative feedback nonetheless, but the reviewer had taken the time to read the book and offer their opinion. The reviewer was polite in the approach they used; they attempted very graciously to make the author see that she could do better, and they also made a point of saying they wished the author success with their next book. The fact that the author was shocked to see such a bad review and made it very clear in her response, did unfortunately take away the reviewer's optimism for any future sales. What the author failed to do was thank the reviewer for spending three days of valuable time reading a book she hadn't really enjoyed.

I knew I would love seeing the world with him if that’s where his career took him, but would I be able to handle the long period of time between seeing my family?

So now the choice was down to rubber mats vs. rubber tiles. This was an easy decision as well. My half of the garage measure 14 ft long x 10 ft wide. Both rubber mats and tiles are sold in packages of 4 ft x 6 ft, meaning that 4 would give me a workout space 12 ft long x 8 ft wide. The rubber mats are a better option because they are 1 solid piece and lay on the ground well because of there weight, not to mention 4 pieces would connect pretty easily. They are also made of a higher quality of rubber. The problem-the run about $60 a piece for a 4 x 6 piece AND I NEED 4!!!! THAT’S $260!!!! Needless to say-a little of if my budget for flooring. So I went with my other option-packs of rubber mats that consist of 6 2 ft x 2 ft tiles (one of the "before" pics actually has the flooring in its packaging). I’ve dealt with 1 ft x 1 ft tiles and had my concerned because the tiles would move around a lot and break apart sometimes. However I was pretty sure the moving around was due to the fact that it was a small number of tiles which equals less weight and they were sitting on top of hard wood flooring. As for them breaking apart, my thoughts are that it was due to there only being a few tiles (less stability and support), the smaller size of the tiles, and not all of them having border pieces. I need 4 packs of the rubber tiles, which wasn’t a problem considering they only cost $19-a total of $80 with tax!!!! Even though the rubber mats are a little better quality, I’m not really worried because A)-my gym is a HOME gym, not commercial and B) I plan on taking care of it properly!

Written in 1993 by Sebastian Faulks, Birdsong is considered a classic of modern English literature. It tells the story of Stephen Wraysford, a troubled young man who falls deeply in love with a married Frenchwoman named Isabelle Azaire in 1910. The book follows Wraysford into the trenches during World War I, and through his eyes the reader experiences some of the major battles fought on the Western Front. Millions of copies of Birdsong have been sold worldwide and it is regularly voted one of Britain’s favorite novels. It is considered so significant, in fact, that it is required reading in British schools.

This is not solely an OHIM-specific issue as most EU IPOs currently accept most class heading wordings whether they agree with 4/03 and “class-heading-covers-all” or not.

IPKat readers’ thoughts and comments will be most welcome, but in the meantime on to genus terms and individual terms. Use of genus terms and lists of individual terms Both the UK IPO and OHIM have examination concerns on broader goods/services terms, notably when they approach points of vagueness, but just where clarity and precision stop and vagueness starts is not easy to determine. It might be thought that a broad term covering goods or services in multiple classes could be vague, but neither office currently takes that view as such as they generally do not object if there are such goods/services in the class(es) designated by the applicant.

My whole entire life, all 42 years I have hated the word skinny. I used to get teased when I was a kid growing up for being a bean pole. Granddad used to take great glee in calling me grasshopper because of my long skinny legs. I graduated with a 28" waist and I am 6'2" and I weighed a whopping 118 lbs. Slim was a word that I heard often. My family was more full figured to say the least, so I was constantly encouraged to eat something and suffered incessant ribbing because, well, you could actually see my ribs.

But believers must know that demons are more abundant and present than many people realize and need to learn their strategies, for effective defense.
After a series of improvements, consultations with interior designers, and canvassing accessories and furniture, my Bridal Boutique is now exactly how I originally envisioned it to be… a polished, inviting and inspiring space.
I decided not to go to Komiža if it’s going to cost 40kuna return. Am walking to Kut to see if I can use a computer in the library. It’s another fine day, but the library is closed until 1600. I don’t think I’m in the right frame of mind for getting on a bus and doing tourism.
The ever vigilant Critical Mick directs us toward the Gutter Bookshop website, and their upcoming attractions, wherein lurks the news that Michael Clifford will be launching his debut tome GHOST TOWN (Hachette Ireland) on Tuesday evening, May 8th, at 6.30pm. An intriguing prospect: Michael - or Mick - Clifford is one of Ireland’s best known and well regarded journalists, currently writing for the Irish Examiner and the Sunday Times, and not a man known to tuck an acerbic opinion about Ireland Inc. under a bushel. Which suggests that GHOST TOWN could be a very entertaining read indeed. Quoth the blurb elves: Once they had everything to gain ...
A lot of struggles go on in the mind of a man on a daily basis. The struggles come in form of negative thoughts and suggestions which the devil use to introduce confusion, doubts and ultimately lure his victims into committing sin.

The kid clearly is evil, and it’s not her fault – but the film doesn’t really explore too many angles on what this means or where it comes from. Just as Omen isn’t really interested in Damien, it’s interested in the evil that befalls good people, this film isn’t interested in the evil kid. It’s far more interested in the mother wallowing in her sorrow.
“Bitch!” shouted Andy as she slapped Olivia hard across the face, knocking her onto the floor. Andy got on top of her and the two started going at it. Olivia’s nipples could be seen plainly exposed by her ill-fitting jumpsuit as the two rolled on the floor. Other inmates gathered around and started cheering. It was instant mayhem as the two girls went at it like animals.
...and then I turned around and bought her a pair for Christmas this year. Yeah, I did. I'm all about teaching my kids about financial responsibility and the fact that money doesn't grow on trees and all that...but, I couldn't help myself....

Baird, by contrast, has consistently been on the cutting edge of the notion that false convictions could be rooted out while still ensuring the guilty are convicted, standing up as a leader on the issue as far back as the late 1990s both while serving on the Court of Criminal Appeals and afterward, leading Grits to recently call him "virtually the father of Texas DNA exonerations" for his role in the Roy Criner case.

It's been absolutely gorgeous here today, so I went out into the world rather than sit around moping that my team got eliminated in the MLB playoffs. I had several things on my to-do list and on my first stop I got a Cinderella pumpkin, some fake greens, and some baking apples, then moved on to a cool shop Five and Divine. There I procured a starting supply of ASCP in Old White and Duck Egg, as well as the light and dark waxes, and some friendly advice from the proprietress, who is a new stockist. I'm taking the plunge!

Before I could read or write, as a small child I had a little easel in my father's studio. I'd paint away quietly in a corner or look at his old books. He never taught me directly - but I learnt concentration and I often watched him paint. It must have helped me gain a facility at drawing.
Aviation and airline industry is the only web of transportation capable of covering the globe. It is crucial for many aspects as business, economy, tourism, social-culture and integration. Many economists agree on the fact that the manufacturing of the first B747-400 – capable of flying long distances as from Paris to New York – triggered the power of globalization, acting as a catalyst. This is one of the many examples to let understand the significance of aviation in the human history.
Here then, is a shortish list of how I keep and/or trick myself into being motivated enough to keep writing.

Noah does surprisingly well on the field; even if he does have a compulsive need to do a somersault as he runs down the field, and a flying leap here and there as he runs for the ball. I'm OK with those brief moments of silliness, because when his foot does connect with the ball it is solid.

The journey to becoming parents felt redeeming for us in many ways. It felt like it healed places that were caused by our rocky first year. Struggling some with infertility gave us something to lean on each other for in ways that brought us closer together. Honestly, I wouldn't change that part of our love story for the world. It was a beautiful thing we did together. I was honored to struggle and cry, wait and hope, alongside this man.
My first class, I was really discouraged. I was still attempting to put lines on paper, and most of my classmates had finished their drawings and shaded them by the time our classtime was over. The second class, I cried from just being so frustrated. The third went much better, and while I noted improvement, I was happy about that improvement and not happy about my work inherently.
All beautiful pictures from The Selby, of course.

Haha, what a joke. I joke about Florida every year during spring break. I don’t need to go to Florida for my break because I can find sunshine and warmth in my house…literally. Our back living room is full of windows, which make the room really cold at night, but incredibly warm during the day when the sun is shining. Plus, I’ve got greenhouses in my backyard. Epic!
I promise I'll always take care of you.
I'm absolutely staggered that the man largely responsible for the mess this country is in has the nerve to lecture anyone on economics. This is the man who destroyed our pensions, sold our gold after telling the world in advance pushing the price down, spent £3000 per second for 13 years, strangled our private companies to fund his ever growing public sector, sat back as our currency depreciated and left every family in this country with £50,000 of debt. Investments were made under PFI and or PPP at six time that would have cost if the projects were funded directly by the tax payer, the regulatory regime was degraded , stealth taking and off the book borrowing held sway.
But how's this for an extraordinary acknowledgement of some of the issues CAMRA has, some of the problems people like me have with the way the organisation can sometimes put itself across?
The next leg of our journey was a long one: Upper and Lower Slaughter to Preston. On the way I gave a name to our rental car, which was appropriately named Little Red. She was a good car for us and did a great job navigating us through the tiny, narrow roads.
So yeah, I see all of these elements as having both definitive and literal physical as well as metaphysical properties.

Now, we are not talking about using this in Edible gardens, however, this could be used in any area that you want to eliminate lawn, the downside is that the rugs are too thick to dig a shovel in to plant anything, unless of course you pile soil over it and are creating a 'berm' effect, of at least 12 inches deep or more. Keep this in mind as you decide where to try this.
None of this suggests that an education-only strategy will work. Obviously, we still need to focus on education, but we need to focus on boosting the labor market, and on reducing inequality, and lowering the poverty rate as well to ensure that people can earn a living wage whether they’ve attended college or not. All these things will also help our education system – employed, economically secure parents can provide better for their children and are more likely to have time to provide them help with school, both things that will help their kids do better in school.

Why I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan is a short work by dystopian English author J.G. Ballard, first published in 1968 as a pamphlet by the Unicorn Bookshop in Brighton, England. It was later collected in ‘The Atrocity Exhibition’ (an experimental collection of Ballard’s ‘condensed novels’). It is written in the style of a scientific paper and catalogs an apocryphal series of bizarre experiments intended to measure the psychosexual appeal of Ronald Reagan, who was then the Governor of California and candidate for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination. Ballard himself was inspired by the then-new phenomenon of ‘media politicians’: ‘In his commercials Reagan used the smooth, teleprompter-perfect tones of the TV auto-salesman to project a political message that was absolutely the reverse of bland and reassuring. A complete discontinuity existed between Reagan’s manner and body language, on the one hand, and his scarily simplistic far-right message on the other. Above all, it struck me that Reagan was the first politician to exploit the fact that his TV audience would not be listening too closely, if at all, to what he was saying, and indeed might well assume from his manner and presentation that he was saying the exact opposite of the words actually emerging from his mouth.’
With the technology now available, we’ve begun to see people take up the elements of book publishing that they enjoy most. Because they can.
I don’t avoid questions. In fact I answer them truthfully. Some people might even say that I talk too much. Stating everything, declaring anything. Hell, and I even say things over and over again. I know people are annoyed, but these are the same people who wanted to know what I feel. Now, would you blame me?
The things I must relinquish are harder to discern. I get them confused with the things that I lack. I suppose He can’t take what He didn’t give in the first place. But I know there are always things to relinquish, because my heart is always clinging to Less Beautiful Things (also known as idols).
Should be a pretty solid week - chillin with Theresa, watching a couple Phils games, cooking up some good food, brewing with Keith on Thursday night (not sure what kind of beer yet - possibly some sort of holiday ale), doing some more organizing, and a smattering of video games sessions here and there.

I was now really pleased each time she went to the chair and picked up the rucksack. I stood quietly while she put it on me again, adjusted the other strap and did it up. She gave me another treat and left it on me a little bit longer. I was quite disappointed when she took it off me. The next time she put it on me, she moved back a little and I had to walk a couple of paces to get my treat.
This problem is deeply rooted in our education system. It boils down to classroom shortage, inadequate instructional materials, and undesirable class size. Teachers’ proficiency must also be assessed. No teachers are inefficient nor not proficient to teach the language but it must be stressed that teachers also need to refresh and enhance skills.
Let’s face facts here!

In August 2007 Modise apparently served the Bijkersmas with court papers, threatening to take them to the Labour Court for unfair dismissal.
Starting from other experiences, other authors make similar points. Kyla Wazana Tompkins writes forcefully about the importance of autobiographical accounts in shaping our politics. She belongs to a Moroccan Arab Jewish family and she writes about Arab Jews living in North Africa before the establishment of Israel. Although some of these people migrated to Israel, they were pushed aside by the European Jews who held power and controled the narratives told. Inside Israel or outside, these Arab Jews have become invisible as polarization of Arabs and Jews has increased. Again, Ahmed confirms this account when she tells of a close childhood friend who left Cairo with her Jewish family because they feared for their future after Nassar took control in the 1950s and began to preach hatred of Jews.

And then Scribe was down. For the count and for about four months after. I had landed wrong on one patio stone. Actually it was two patio stones with one of them being uneven. My ankle buckled, twisted, turned and it was over. Embarrassed and incredulous that I had forgotten I was indeed accident prone, I removed my shoe (mistake number 2, the first was actually touching the Skip-It again). It swelled instantly and I could no longer put my shoe back on. I was also very stoic and told myself to "suck it up Princess" and went about my day like nothing had happened.

If writer's block is causing you to stumble, stop and take a breather. Think. Ponder. Ask questions about why you are experiencing this barrier to progress. Take a walk, listen to music, watch a movie, or talk to a child. And if you need to do some exercises with writing prompts then let me suggest going for the practical prompts that are right there in your life. What you write about is an extension of who you are. Why shouldn't the writing exercises you do be a part of who you are as well.

The TKDL website has a list of European patent applications in which "citation of TKDL references as prior art have led to significant strides towards achieving the goal of preventing misappropriation of Indian Traditional Knowledge". At the time of writing the list refers to 79 European applications that have been either withdrawn, refused or amended, allegedly as a result of TKDL cited references. One of these, EP2251029, was recently the subject of an article in the Times of India, which was noted by Spicy IP. The TofI stated that "India has successfully foiled a bio-piracy bid by a Swiss multi-national firm to patent an age-old Indian home remedy - milk as a laxative". Was this true? Had the TKDL been used in this way, and had a patent application really been made for milk as a laxative?
Just starting out by saying sorry for the multitude of posts about parent teacher conference and my feelings about school. I think it is the only thing I do lately. Meet with teacher, make a new "plan for success," yell at my kids about doing homework, they still don't do it, they get Fs, then it starts all over. Vicious cycle. But it is my life. It makes for boring monotonous posts. Skip it if you are sick of it. I wish it were that easy for me.
Which leads me to the conclusion that some people, who understand what it could and should look like, have a responsibility to build a community that runs to wounded people (which is all of us) and not away. A community that knows how to begin conversations about pain in a way that lead people to the Healer and towards wholeness. That teaches once-wounded people how to speak to and love now-wounded people and walk with them towards emotional health, maturity and joy in their relationship with Jesus.
3.When the syrup has reached 240 degrees F, set the mixer to low and slowly drizzle a tiny bit of syrup, a couple tablespoons' worth, into the egg whites to warm them. (If you add too much syrup at once, the egg whites will scramble.) Slowly drizzle in the rest of the syrup and then increase the speed to medium -high. Beat until the marshmallow creme is stiff and glossy, 7 to 9 minutes; towards the end of the beating time, beat in the vanilla. Use immediately or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
I’m going to keep this post short and sweet. This weekend was of course everyone’s favorite train wreck of a holiday, St. Pats!

One of the things authors struggle with is how to get their books into the hands of readers who want to read them. There are so many books out there right now to choose from–especially with the boom in the Indie market. Does online advertising work? Do blog tours work? Do giveaways work? We’re constantly asking ourselves this question because all of these things—as fun as they can be—take away from what writers love and want to do, which is write that next book. For me the hardest part of being a published author is balancing the promotion side of writing with the actual writing. It’s so easy to use up a whole day (like today!) doing promo for my most recent book when what I need to be doing is writing the next book in the series.

One of my favorite things about the book was Aspen’s existing relationship with Peter and then her conflicting and developing relationship with Jack. There’s a lot of tension between her and Peter, but it’s just so relatable – Everyone’s been there – The sexual tension with someone who’s “just a friend”. And then we’re introduced to Jack (who I was glad she started to carry on with!) and we see Peter’s conflicting emotions towards their relationship as well as a few curveballs. I also really liked Peter because I saw a little mix of a lot of my friends in his character. I loved the back-and-forth between him and Aspen, and also that their friendship is obviously mutually valued because he always has her back.
“That would be stupid.” There is so much that happens during this section of the book that it definitely is a must read. What is real, what is a simulation, how much can Tris take of all this experimentation. After this there is much planning of what will happen next, how to take down the Erudite and who to trust. That is a large factor in this book, trust. Who do you believe and are they right? There are revelations that are made, secrets revealed. Trusts and bonds broken and repaired. There is love and hate. There is fighting and peace. Who comes out the victor in the end now that the truth has come out? What will happen next????

And I am pleased that my guess that the initials "T.T.P." in the brickwork meant that it had once belonged to Thomas Tertius Paget, Liberal MP for South Leicestershire (1867-8, 1880-5) and Harborough (1885-6), turned out to be correct.
I'm going to hear poetry readings Saturday at Paragraph's On Padre Blvd.... one of the events in the Rio Grande Valley International Poetry Festival. I went last year and really enjoyed the readings. The teen and I will be on the island anyway getting him a haircut from Sharla at Venus Nails and Spa...and ordering wrist corsages (yes, that is plural) for his dates to Prom (it's a long story for another time - they're going as friends). Anyway, he's into poetry, because when he hears or reads poetry...he tends to want to put it to music. I told him I wanted to go over to Paragraphs for their second session, and he said he wouldn't mind joining me. Sounds like a nice afternoon.
As soon as I let "DD" have the Giraffe, she immediately fell in Love and snuggled with it while also exploring all his features and spots on his back. She wouldn't let it go for several hours and carried it around the house with her and even took it outside with her, which surprised me because she doesn't usually take her indoor toys outside with her. She has many outside toys that tend to stay out there, she enjoys playing with. It was blatantly apparent that "DD" was instantly attached to this little guy and that made me very happy. She has a few other favorite plush and dolls. BUT there is only one other doll that she favors and carries around the house with her. So her reaction to the giraffe was very good needless to say. AND the biggest shocker.....she actually brought him to bed with her!! She hasn't done that before with any of her other plush or dolls, except the one other doll that is her favorite and has brought that to bed a couple times. But Giraffe is a regular bedtime buddy now!
Er, Bridget’s been in over her head since the bloody show started and she foolishly reunited with Siobhan but in terms of the naff Ponzi scheme plot, er not so much. This episode tried to give Andrew a bit more facets as a character and sadly, it didn’t succeed all that well for it.

"In order to prove or disprove Mr. Black's contention that the first settlers on the American continent were from Atlantis, it was necessary that a genuine Indian take part in the experiment," he explained. "Of course, in order to be really scientific, we should have an Egyptian as well; but none was procurable. However, Mr. Black is convinced that his earliest forebears were Atlanteans; so that will have to suffice.
Liew said these voters were not supporters of any political blocks and mostly were cyber savvy young people who want democratisation of the country.
Start by bringing what we'll call the laid threads up to the surface. I used six strands of floss because I wanted a nice thick cord; use less for a more delicate one. Rethread your needle with a second thread in the same color (I used three strands) and bring it to the front using the same hole as the laid threads.
Along my route to work, there is a certain intersection where accidents happen often. It's a four-way intersection with a stop sign in only two directions, and people often miss the stop sign. It should really be a four-way stop, but it's been this way for as long as I can remember. I always go through that intersection cautiously, but I've had a few near-misses when the driver coming from the side failed to stop.
For Tenaganita executive director Irene Fernandez, the new system would only result in more extortion of foreign workers by bogus officers.

It’s just strange to laugh at the sheet for it’s asking questions she mastered long ago, when I have been often known to laugh at them with Braska because she’s not anywhere near some of the things it’s asking.
One of the contrasts I find most interesting is the idea of joy without pain. I would like to think that it would be completely possible for me to feel happiness without having experienced sorrow. I would be more than happy to put that theory to the test. Give me a life without tears and I’ll tell you if I can feel genuine happiness. While at first it sounds inviting, truthfully I know that part of what makes the highs feel so great is that they stand in contrast to our lows, and we have a greater appreciation for them. Now that’s not to say that we should go out and seek that which brings pain just to help us understand happiness. I know people who do that. We usually call them Drama Llamas, and while they are adept at bringing pain to their own lives, it often means inflicting it upon others as well. Most people go through that stage in their early twenties, but maturity helps us grow out of it. At least for most people. But the average person doesn’t go around creating crisis. There’s enough naturally occurring that we don’t need to go looking for it.
Another important part to know is that my brother’s friend Andy plays violin.
Mr Elbows gets up to go to the toilet. I slide down in the hard seat and casually allow my arm to land on the armrest. Bliss. Even not being able to unfold my legs past ninety degrees seems bearable now. Then Luggage Mother’s child somehow manages to catapult her teddy bear in my direction. It lands at my feet. Right side. Armrest side. I see Mr Elbows swaying towards his seat. Luggage Mother’s child’s lip begins to shudder in a way that can only mean noise is coming. Luggage Mother looks at me. I try to grab the teddy with my left hand, but the angle is wrong. I’m going to have to use my right one. I peel it off the armrest and swiftly swoop up the stuffed bear, handing it to the grateful mother, then… he’s back in his seat, arm on the armrest. Bastard.
Rubber is a far better choice better choice than carpet. It’s far more durable and easier to clean-it can be swept daily and mopped as often as you want(usually once or twice a week)

One of the drawbacks perks of being a geek mom is that you get to raise geek kids. This poses a problem sometimes - for example, D&D time is Mommy and Daddy time. Our 16-year-old doesn't understand this concept and can't understand why he can't just jump right into our game mid-campaign (D&D games can last YEARS). Another example is that my four year old son can now play Portal and Portal 2 better than some adults. Why is this a problem? Well . . . Okay, it's not a problem, I just wanted to brag on my 4-year-old gaming prodigy of a son!
“Servability grows a third time when a couple learns that their life together is a shared ministry and vision. As long as two people see their lives as two separate thrusts of existence where they rise or fall on their own merits, there is no marital ball game of consequence.” (127)

Because of shortages nationwide, for years hospitals have had to turn overseas to bolster their ranks of nurses. More than half the foreign-trained nurses come from the Philippines, according to a 2005 study by Minority Nurse, which focuses on career and education training.

I have a serious paper addiction, and a never-ending desire to buy more of everything! I started with rubberstamps and graduated to digital stamps, as they are so much easier to store and you can get them almost instantly. Copics came along also, so my colouring progressed with the help of endless tutorials and lots of practice. Thank goodness for the internet! I’ve just bought 120 polychromo pencils which I’m having fun learning to use. I have a dedicated room for all my stash, and my dogs all join me in there while I'm playing, gets

The Sakuga wiki has this to say about Obari: He had already found his own animation style at the young age of 18, by 19 he had become a Mecha Designer, then at 20 he was doing work as an Animation Director and by 21 he began directing episodes. However, when he worked on the opening of Dragonar, his talent went on full display and it became the talk of the industry. Some would call him a young prodigy.
Last year around this time, Lidia and Bella had a hard time getting along.

I didn't actually own either of those colors so I approximated with PTI's Spring Moss and Aqua Mist. The patterned paper also came from Papertrey Ink: Happy Spots. I used one of my favorite Waltzingmouse sets: Sewing Box Hugs. The trees on either side of the house were made by cutting some of the flowers in half, and adding some fine leather cord, split at the top, for trunks and branches. The long stem stamp in the set was used to make a set of hedges around the house. Also used some of my vintage mini ric-rac along the bottom and also to make shades in the windows. The final touches were tiny black glass beads, and tiny buttons.

Though I'm sure it can't be true in real life, the whole tone of the first part suggests to me that Collective Action is only for the absolutely most marginalised, through all the intersecting systems of the kyriarchy. Certainly, an effort needs to be made to organise such layers, but to the exclusion of all others? Well, that's my inference of Collective Action's position from their statement.
I then punched a hole in the top of the baggies and put them on a huge binder ring.

Using the web as well as the fast access to information, many people think they can properly take up their court case and defend on their own. However, that knowledge can’t be considered a substitute to authentic encounters. Criminal legal representatives invest plenty of their time and work working with cases and simply being in the courtroom. These individuals go through these kinds of matters consistently. They are completely tuned in to the trade secrets. They are completely conscious of the procedure. These people really do know the variations concerning many jurisdictions. Primarily, these people have an understanding of exactly what the law declares. This is the reason precisely why you should have the assistance of a Virginia criminal defense lawyer.

How did Christmas get to be only a week away? We still don't have our tree or any decorations up! I would have been blogging about everything I've been doing for the last couple of weeks (mainly crafting of presents and eating of christmas dinners) but I've been too busy doing it all! I've started to feel rather stressed.

Absolutely nothing. Once every four years, we have the opportunity to vote for president, but in the interim, we have no control over what the federal government does. We can only pray that God exists, that he hears our prayers, and that he stays the hand of Postmaster Patrick R. Donahoe (all unlikely).

It is my impression, for instance, that string theory in physics isn’t widely accepted as true simply because we haven’t found a way to test it—to test that its predictions are verified or not. And I often hear—Anthony Grayling and Hitchens both said this, I believe—that a theory that can explain everything explains nothing (i.e., God constructed the process of evolution). In other words, a theory that can’t be shown wrong is useless. The presupposes falsifiability as a criterion for scientific truth.

Ivan’s crepe – with pepperoni sausage, mixed herbs, and ‘cheese blend’, an ingredient that appears in 80% of the menu items – is crowned with a triumphant fried egg. A rare look of delight flickers across Ivan’s face. He is known to eat like a duck – gulping, not chewing – and when I look up on my third mouthful, his plate is eerily clean and he is gazing over the brim of his coffee mug once more.
As one commenter stated, freer to say the “N” word and be as racist as she wants? She didn’t attempt to help the caller at all, and instead went on this tirade which indicates her true feelings. Though she is not a Christian (she is Jewish), she acts like one in the way she wants her First Amendment rights upheld to say what she wants, but doesn’t want anyone else to exercise their right to criticize what she says.
Nevertheless “Inside Story” is a very valuable addition to the many past (and no-doubt forthcoming) appraisals of John Stott’s ministry. Steer regularly succeeded in causing me to pause and pray; to give thanks and ask to be Christ-like in the way John Stott was. This was the fitting theme of his final Keswick appearance in June 2007: “God wants us to become like Christ. Christ-likeness is the will of God for the people of God.” (p.271).

The other thing that had me wondering some was the wheel choice. Fulcrum (part of Campagnolo) makes a fine hoop, but their base level wheel on a no-holds-barred race bike is somewhat troubling. Again, I suspect I know why this is done—to control costs and running on the theory that most folks getting this bike have or will get their preferred race wheels. That makes some sense on the highest end bikes. But a racer looking to get a race bike out of the box, would be better served with a nicer wheelset. The stock Fulcrum whoops are decidedly un-aero and quite heavy when compared with other even entry-level race wheels. Noticeably, pictures of the S5 bikes on Cervelo’s website show different wheels on the bikes.
Happy New Year to all. Hope that everyone made it though the holiday season intact and not too worse for wear. The last day of 2007 was a work day for Muckney Brewing, as Justin and I bottled the Batch XI Dark IPA and transferred the Dark and Mysterious Cinnamon Porter to secondary. Of course we had many a tasting while doing so, tasting some delicious winter ales from Jolly Pumpkin and Sly Fox.
It is for you to find your place in the history of humanity. Nobody can do it for you. It is a work that will be left undone unless you do it yourself. The world doesn't need another Mother Teresa. The Church doesn't need another Francis of Assisi. The world needs you. The Church needs you. Mother Teresa had a role to play in God's plan, and she played it. Francis had a mission to fulfill in God's plan, and he fulfilled it. Now it falls to you to find your role, your place.
SweetLi: My friend Becky is sitting at the bar. She does characters! You must come and meet her.
About a month ago, the boy and I got married! Everything went perfectly. I honestly could have not asked for anything more (well except for my brother to be there). It was a very short ceremony and then the reception was at my house. Only family was invited, but since my brother lives out of state and just got a new job, he wasn't able to fly back home in time. Good thing we're having a vow renewal next year that he can be at!
Occupy Wall Street came with the people's mic. Students from the affected schools were clustered to right of the panel. The charters folks were on the left, huddled and lacking in cohesion. Parents and community members were rapidly filling seats throughout the auditorium. Elected officials or their representatives were here. On the right near students and administrators were staff members from the schools. DOE staffers trotted back and forth whispering to various DOE representatives, carrying water for the thirsty. B.I.T.s (Bureaucrats in Training*) clattered up and down the aisle.(*my thanks to Mark K for that turn of phrase)

The emerald swallowtail butterfly lives in South-East Asia, and has a wing-span of about 8 – 10 cm, and is one of the most prominent butterflies in this area.

Well, my family just returned home from what can only be described as one of the best family christmases ever. Why? First of all, if asked what I did over the trip, my first response would be "absolutely nothing"...unless you count eating great food, sleeping plenty, words with friends (aka scrabble), and being babied one last time before the real baby comes. Despite the long drive up north, I always look forward to going home for the holidays. We somehow manage to split the time up with both families and everybody's happy. If I had to choose my top 5 memories of the week, these would be them:

Cynthia had said it was like taking bullet to the chest, being told you had cancer.

It certainly provided reflection on mortality at any rate.
Seventy journals are participating in the pilot, including Ecology, American Anthropologist, PMLA, the Journal of Political Economy, the Journal of Finance, and the American Historical Review. Since 1995, JSTOR, which aggregates the back issues of more than 1,000 scholarly journals, dating back hundreds of years, in its digital archive, has made its bones selling subscriptions to libraries — charging its largest clients up to $50,000 per annum. The organization says that business model is still working, despite reports that many libraries are cutting expenditures. JSTOR has operated at a 5 percent surplus in each of the last five years, according to McGregor.

I purposely haven’t put quantities down since you can never tell how long your birth will take and how long you will remain in the post-natal ward. Some mothers leave hospital within a few hours whilst more complicated births can result in a longer stay. Therefore, take enough for a couple of days but leave additional supplies, well labelled, at home for your partner to bring in as necessary. Perhaps go through it with them since new parents don’t necessarily know the difference between a romper suit, a babygro and a sleepsuit; I certainly didn’t and neither did my husband. Also ensure that your partner knows the whereabouts of the closest Mothercare. Boots or similar in case there is something that you have totally forgotten.

Though it can be countered by drawing off the dead wall as Saki so kindly demonstrated, still it is monstrous as it is.

I felt there was more to say about Samir. I was walking on the beach one day on Hayling Island, near where my parents used to live and I thought, ‘What if two teenagers saw a man thrown out of a boat and pulled him out of the sea and the man turns out to be a poor, tortured student who has been refused asylum? What would they do and what if one of the teenagers was Samir?’

I still remember vividly as a beginner, sitting and sitting and sitting, and being told to smile and smile and smile until I thought that my face would crack into a million fissures. I am back there. I had better luck at the traditional milongas. Spent hours sitting at Villa Malcolm, danced only with Sorin, and could not get a cabeceo returned to save my life. I thought about trying to cabeceo cross eyed for the last hour. Maybe that would make a difference. I was sitting with a new friend, and she managed to cabeceo a guy whom I could not get to hold my glance if I had sent up a flare and stripped to my panties. Don't get me wrong, I truly was thrilled for her, it was her first cabeceo, and it made her night. But that was the last straw for me. My fissures were showing.
Bill was known to say to his kids, “I brought you into this world, I can take you out.” This sense of humor is not only pervasive through this parent’s parenting style, but it is also preventative. It prevents you from killing the child. A Bill Cosby Parent often looks at his or her child as if they are a species from another planet, brought here to do ridiculous things, and bring about torment to anyone over 35. It is through this lens that the Bill Cosby Parent disciplines and recoils in horror. If more families practiced a dose of this type of parenting, perhaps, we’d have less runaways. And by runaways, of course, I mean, runaway parents.

Therefore with a few simple steps there is no reason why the GB team can not emulate the Hungarians and take a bigger step forward; competing with the likes of Slovenia and Austria to gain the promotion that will put ice hockey in the UK back on the map in a big way.

5) When I was your age… – Oh, you’re thirteen minutes younger than me? Allow me to tell you about the “Good Ol’ Days”. Here I am, standing by the vintage video game kiosk at Mall of America. The sixteen year old is playing his fancy new video game system, the one that you plug into your head and the game appears inside your mind. And here I am, staring at games that consist of “pixels” and telling him about the wonders of the Sega Genesis.
I’ll keep you…you’ll be my jar of smiles.
The promise of tomorrow’s roam.
Alas, I forgot that having your own nook for crafts does not necessarily mean that you are good with crafts. It also does not mean that you can contain the mess in one area.
This applies even if:
But if Steve Jackson thinks it's the right thing to do ... you don't argue with the OGRE.
Ferdinando, Shamindra “Tackling illegal immigrants: Australia’s SLN role,” Island, 22 Oct. 2010.
By the weekend the 5:45 workshop options had multiplied. I chose “God at work in us: how do we hear His call?” and found myself in a large room filled almost entirely with twenty-somethings. Was the question of vocation simply more relevant to the young, or was it that older people had stopped asking questions they didn’t want the answer to— or maybe felt they already had. The idea of calling was profoundly important to me. I had read Parker Palmer’s book Let your Life Speak many times— even led a retreat based on the material— and was now eager to hear what a brother from Taize would add to my growing understanding.

And the owl deep in his tree kingdom,
It was cold by then, not a typical Southern California day. But then, nothing was typical. I had on my down parka I brought from Washington, but no one else was prepared. My nephew and his mom left. My cousin left. Then my brother and wife left. My husband and friend and I finally got in the car and started down the hill.
Jack has to learn manners and ways of speaking and addressing people in society. Ma can no longer breastfeed Jack because he’s five years old and society doesn’t approve. There are so many new rules to learn to be an accepted member of society.

These two songs talk about how you can be SO fine without that someone who has always tried to bring you down, thinking that they know and that you would be rotten without them. But leaving them makes you stand stronger.
Gemma was NOT by any stretch of imagination as engaging as Jane. She just wasn't. I wasn't able to live in her head like I am able to live in Jane's. I wasn't able to make a strong, emotional attachment to Gemma. There were a couple of scenes that are convincing or believable in Jane Eyre that just AREN'T convincing or believable in The Flight of Gemma
That a man and a woman might learn how to give, and in giving know the "act of sharing" or "holding in common"....
...and then I laid it down empty and shapeless, knowing someday I'll need to put those clothes away. Someday.
Anyway, what we're doing here today is wrapping up our Third Annual Christmas Letter. I know you been waiting. So here we go.
See, I'm not in the habit of trying to save people from themselves. But truth be told, I'm a helper by nature, especially if I can help someone that I love fiercely. Unfortunately, I can't help those that don't think they need fixing, even when they are on a fast derailing train to Shitsville. It drives me absolutely insane to watch someone I love self destruct before my eyes and know that I am completely powerless to do anything to stop it. Some call it stratification, and I suppose it is. It's not an easy pill to swallow, though, when that person is everything to you. It's heartbreaking and infuriating.
Oh and if you don't know me very well yet, than you might not know about my crazy obsession with Christmas music. I start listening to it in October every year. But, I love it and I buy almost every album that ever comes out. Including this one.
More specifically, red peony root is used to treat heat rash, to correct poor circulation and to stop hemorrhages. White peony root is used for irritability and muscle cramping, vaginal discharges, excessive menstrual bleeding, and excessive sweating. It is also given to treat a large variety of gynecological disorders and to avert miscarriage.

By the late 1700's, astronomers were disturbed by the conspicuous gap between Mars at 1.6 AU and Jupiter at 5.2 AU (1 astronomical unit = 1 AU = the distance between Earth and the Sun). Titius and Bode drew up an entirely empirical equation to calculate the distance of planets from the Sun which worked out quite nicely. There was a missing term in their equations, though...precisely in this gap, around 2.5 AU, suggesting there should be a planet there. Quoting Titius from 1768:
“She’s hurt! Over here!” Sam called. He now rested on his left elbow and pointed toward Hannah’s still body.
Does that conjure up cooking of bland boring food?
I think as a female DJ a lot of lads don’t really take you seriously – that is until they see you on the decks! Music is a male dominated scene and I suppose I felt I had to prove your self – but men do too. I think the fact that my male friends from back in the never believed I’d do it gave me a lot of drive to do it bigger and better! If your good at what you do, male or female, people will see that, but people react differently to girls and boys in any situation. My mate S Man always says that I ‘DJ like a dude’ – I just think most lads don’t expect heavy sounds to come from a female DJ! I remember playing Spektrum in Sankeys in 2010 and some guy at the front near the booth answered his phone and said in a really surprised tone something like ‘Ye there’s this girl DJ on, she’s alright yaknow!’ It made me giggle!

Wow! I just want to thank everyone for all the comments, advice, high-fives, and especially those who've decided to take this journey with me. I am truly humbled and honored. I wish I could comment back to each person! Maybe I will have some time this weekend. Life is bizz-ay!
P.S. What have you been listening to? Lately I have been into electronic music, which strikes me as odd, but I can’t get enough. I really like Chicane and created a Slacker station with it, and that led me to some other stuff this week that I’ve really loved, and will probably share in the future. Here’s a taste:
I decided this would make picking up Jared and his friend who was going to come over to play after scout camp a bit difficult. So I got on my phone and canceled the play date and got someone else to get Jared after camp. Now I was only left with three kids and two or three hours to burn. I loaded the younger kids in the stroller and headed for the park which-- thankfully-- was within walking distance of the shop. I found myself grateful for the dismal cloudy day that was not too warm and didn't require sunblock.
And now, the moment of truth!!
The formula was great thankfully, as I tend to have bad luck with Essie's formula. This polish is SUPER glossy without top coat I also didn't want to put one on! I did not have problems with cuticle flooding. It's on the thinner side, but a good thinner. Very happy with it.
Have to go potty. Not sure where. This rug looks good.

The curtains got a good washing too. I had to throw out my chair cushions because they smelled. So I had to steal 2 throw pillows from Monkey's room for me to sit on until I can get new ones.
What are you currently reading???
For the life of me I cannot understand why so many people continue to use the word “Christian” in the form of an adjective.
Brookmyre wrote three books before his fourth was accepted. He said that for some reason publishers are not very tolerant of "books that are shite."
And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto you: Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began. Acts 3:20-21 (KJV)
We did the games, then had the opening exercises, then talked about the chores, then made the chore chart, then had snacks. I chatted with Lane's mom after the meeting, and finally gathered up all of our stuff, gathered up the kids, and headed home. I had to stop and get some gas on the way home, though. We were running on an empty light. That's my sign to get more gas. hehe.
I did follow a sketch for this card but can't remember where and the challenge would be finished by now anyway because I stupidly followed a sketch from last week when I knew that I wouldn't be posting this card until today duh!! lol
As an added bonus, some studies show that babies who wear cloth diapers potty train an average of five months earlier than other babies.

7 Queen Morning (Kissing Rain, Killing Stars) (10:00)
Yes, the bible tells us that we SHOULD submit fully to our husbands. And if mine had told me "I understand your concerns, but I really want to do this now rather than later" then we would have and that would have been the end of it. But the fact is, sometimes our husbands are waiting on US to speak up first because they're afraid of the same thing we are.

And that was just day one…” (April 1, 2011)

A number of people will want the mobile phone as a result of the whole set of good reasons in this article along with because additionally, they will need to have got a hub to plug into the web in laptop or perhaps Pc. Yes, much of the innovative smartphone mobile handsets include the ability some thing as a switch. Cell high speed broadband is really what they call the idea. Conserve a great deal more cash when you indicator away for that cellular high speed internet organize entire using the device you need.
We experienced a problem, fixed it on our end and tried to advocate so that we didn’t experience it again in the future nor did anyone else. But advocacy is often unwelcome. People don’t necessarily want to hear it. They want us to not bother their perfect worlds or to come out in public where we can teach our kids what they need to do. People don’t want to be inconvenienced. Opening your mind or being willing to show tolerance — which is pushed all over the place in this political campaign, to everyone except the disabled — is not something everyone’s going to do, regardless of how hard we tried.
He was able to play dodgeball.
I suppose an argument could be made that any of these could be covered by "it's complicated." I would argue that if any of these (or any other "complicated") apply - you should consider just removing the relationship status from your profile.
During that time the judges will select a the top entries and the following week everybody will have a chance to vote on their favorite. The only requirement is that you link back to the blogfest and keep your entry under under 500 words.
From there I met Bohdon and Ashley at Toronado. Their Bad Boy, El Camino IPA, and Duet's were much better than the dud Red Chair Pale Ale I got (it was the dregs, was cloudy, tasted muddled and bad- definitely not Deschutes' fault). Strike 2 Toronado.
People, people, PEOPLE! I WANT to like you. I would love to give you this job, but when you do such stupid things as misspelling common words, use awkward sentences, or a sloppy format, you worry me. If I'm generous, typos are a three strikes kinda thing. Three or more, and I toss the resume out. But even if I keep it in the running, someone with flawless experience could go to the bottom of the pile when someone else has paid attention to all of the above. So do yourself a favor and proof your resume and cover letter then let someone ELSE do it for you.
We have been so blessed this year with love and help from others. Between the help from others during the pregnancy with Camryn and the friendships we have made we have had a very good year. We are grateful for our family and friends and their constant love and support. We love our Savior Jesus Christ and have seen the many blessings and miracles in our lives. Our family has gained such a testimony of service, both giving service and accepting service. We hope you have a wonderful Christmas season and very Happy New Year!
There is no mention in the article of Augusta National’s history or that it is a private club that can decide membership as it wishes. The entire piece assumes that everyone should be entitled to everything or anything anyone else is doing. I feel like I’m reading a decree from Dolores Umbridge ordering all Hogwarts groups disbanded – no worse it’s the opposite: every club has to admit every pupil.
He gives everyone someone to use against one another. And honestly Bronte wouldn’t have been happy without her little love triangle. Linton just isn’t as attractive as Edgar was in the generation previous.

They want 2 letters of reference, they want a letter from Mom's doctor and the medical records that show she really is disabled and the application form filled out by Mom. After they get the application, they find a dog that is good for Mom then will interview her so the know they have the perfect match for her. Mom is asking for a Standard Poodle and they agree that a Standard is the best match for Mom's health and personality. We will talk more about why in another entry. It takes around $15,000 to $20,000 to train one service dog, but they only ask for a small portion of that from the handlers who receive service dogs and they won't refuse to give a dog to someone who can't pay that. They are a non-profit and always welcome donations so they can help more people!
Thank you for your kind attention,

It’s that time of year again: Tony Awards season! The nominees for this year’s Tony Awards were announced May 1 at the New York Library for the Performing Arts, at Lincoln Center (Playbill.com). Although there were a few unexpected nominees among the Tony contenders, there was a surprisingly large number of productions that were overlooked by the Tony committee. Each category was limited to a select number of nominees, a limitation which left many deserving productions without recognition.
Wikipedia is quite negative. Other sites will tell you what conditions it is beneficial for, how it will detox your body, etc. It’s up to you what you want to believe, but it is cheap to make and tastes nice. And if you do drink it you can learn by experience how / whether it helps you.
This was our 8th week of school for the year. It has been a busy week!
When you write numbers, and means a decimal point. I earned three hundred and seventy-five dollars. Properly that means $300.75. Or I could write, I earned three hundred seventy-five dollars. I'd leave out the decimal or make it a general number such as "I earned about 400 dollars."
LVS spokesman Ron Reed told The Post yesterday that the company is looking at building an “integrated resort development’’ that encompasses casinos and convention centers and other entertainment.
I just hope that their soon-to-be popularity doesn't lead to them being bred indiscriminately. The breed today has almost no genetic disorders and is extremely healthy, smart and well adjusted to family life -- as it has been for millennia. Traces of the Podengo's DNA are found in little, scruffy, pointy-eared dogs all over the world -- pretty much wherever the Portuguese explorers landed -- as the Podengo Pequeno were used as ratters on Portuguese sailing vessels. But it takes only a few generations of poor breeding in puppy mills to destroy a breed. So let's hope, for the sake of the adorable Podengo, that scruffy dog lovers will get their dogs from reputable breeders who are taking care to maintain this ancient breed's wonderful characteristics.

Do you find that your world of blogging does not incorporate the 'real' people in your life? What I mean by that is ... do you find that you start talking about your blog and all the things you do and those around you give you that blank stare.. or worse: the "What are you talking about?" look?
I fell with my son at the beginning of 2010 and had a difficult pregnancy second time around which led me to make the tough decision to take some time out from lampwork. With two preschoolers on my hands it has taken me much longer to get back in the saddle than I had anticipated. After just over a full year out from making lampwork beads, Mojo Boxes and Mini Mo's I got back to the torch full time in April this year and must confess that I'm loving being a self employed glass artist. In addition to the 12 regular places in the Mini Mo' Club I offer short term subscriptions to the Mini Mo' Colour Club in my Etsy glassy supplies shop, Frit N Chips and also lampwork beads at Kitzbitz Art Beads.

After a long day spent laboring tirelessly on some shtuppidd project,my computer decides its probably time to call it a life. your probably wondering what this has to do with a broken bed and if there was sex involved…well, sorry to disapoint you but if you regard my jumping up and down on the bed as sex, then yes, there was sex. Any way, my computer decided to go off without prior notice, taking with it my hard work.In a moment of anger and frustration i attempted to carry out a mock suicide depicting events that would follow if the work wasnt submitted in time. during this period of rage, i may have jumped on the bed a few times after which i landed smack on the floor.
Okay...her brain has gone gimpy like so many other hu-peep brains so that ends my humiliation. Tomorrow...my sister Lily Jayne is up!!

These songs are all over the place as far as timeline goes..There are some songs I wrote when I was 17, and some I wrote 2 years ago. As far as a collective storyline, nothing was intentional. Thus far in my life, my inspiration in writing comes from first hand experience in relationships. It constantly fascinates me the roles we take on, and the twists that occur sometimes…But these are songs I just chose to put on the record cause I wanted to get them out there, and together, they did, kind of create this story.
Oh, and it used to be that young boys would hide a magazine that they got from some neighbour or friend---it could usually be found under the matress in their bedroom or they would smuggle it into the toilet for some one on one time----but kids today have it so much easier---they just covet the ladies underwear section from the variety chain store.
Early this morning, I was chatting with Tita Maggie Ziálcita de Tomás, a former print model and an old friend (we used to be neighbors back in the 80s). I was asking her help if she knows where I can recruit household helpers (a usual problem for me and my wife).

Some, for the sake of their political cause, have sought to downplay the magnitude of what occurred on that September day nine years ago today. “More have died elsewhere” they say, and it is true that there was greater loss of life in Nagasaki, Hiroshima and in Dresden, there were single days in Rwanda which saw greater carnage and it is also true that many more die in earthquakes and other natural disasters. However, there is a context to these things, and it was the context of 09/11 which sets it apart from acts of God and from the crimes of other men.

As I said, I'd usually choose any widening of the democratic franchise, but this one's more complex. For its uncertain what powers a mayor would have or how that would work with - presumably - an elected council executive. You could well imagine the current leader of the council standing and simply changing the job title on the door.
Apparently the ticket office and waiting room that would be built in Portobello would be an eyesore. This coming from the council that approved millions of pounds worth of perma-roadworks known to you and me as the trams project. Now I'm bias towards transport projects so I'm going to focus on the pros side of the argument. However, from the research I did at the time, the con argument mainly seems to be the same tired eyesore bullshit and people not liking the monopoly Stagecoach has on buses.
I am assuming I will gain slightly this Friday, but I can't be sure - I have been trying to be really good about staying away from my scale (I have "cheated" a bit, but not nearly as bas as I was before). So, who knows, maybe I won't gain, maybe I will. In the big scheme of things, a gain this week won't ruin my whole effort. This is an on going thing. I will gain some weeks. I will lose some weeks. I just need to lose MORE than I gain. :) That's the theory, right? Haha

This means that even following Prof. Cowen's advice does not necessarily lead to good Korean food. In Manhattan, for example, one could always find a restaurant around 32nd street that makes no attempt to cater to non-Koreans; that is crowded with prosperous-looking Koreans; whose menu is exclusively comprised of Korean food items with little English description accompanying them. Yet, no matter -- that restaurant will serve shitty Korean food laced with so much MSG that, if you have sensitive stomach like my wife, it will give you the runs all day long.

Let’s remind you that over three years Bradford Council will have cut over £100 million from its budget – that’s 25% of what we get in grant from government. And it’s true, jobs have gone, some unnecessary cuts have been imposed, a few facilities have closed but, in the main, the “cuts” have barely inconvenienced the majority of the City’s population.

I'm gonna be completely honest here. When I saw the new revamped UK cover for Divergent I wasn't a fan. My first thought was PINK? for Divergent? No no no that does not match the story whatsoever! Divergent is one of my all time favourite books and to me I don't really think of a pink cover when I picture the story. I think dark, drastic colours because it's a pretty dark sad dystopian society.

But AKRF's work was very useful to Forest City Ratner and its enablers.

The times where I think recaps are at its worst is when the beginning of each episode recaps the previous episode for the first two to three minutes of it opening. The worst offender of this method is Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle. I don’t know why each episode is set up like this, but I absolutely can’t stand it. Is it really necessary to recap the last episode I just finished watching not too long ago? The start of each episode of Tsubasa ends up making me lose interest in watching the episode for a millisecond because of the time wasted on recapping the previous episode. Why can’t we just go straight into the new episode without the recap? It has been done without any problems in past animes and recaps only prolongs my enjoyment of the actual episode.
Dodds was a supporter of the Traditional Unionist Voice party. Unionism was all fine and well to Junax but he'd sort of given it up when he stopped buying Thundercats toys around 1988, though Unionist protests often meant the schools were closed, which was sweet. Actually Dodds had been barred from TUV meetings because he'd been caught using his Orange sash for masturbation purposes. As far as he was concerned it showed his utter devotion to the ethos. But he'd been already caught using rosaries as anal beads so his card was already marked. Actually as David himself often remarked, that was nothing, anally penetrating yourself using a Royal Irish Rifles 1915 officers revolver was far more pleasurable. He could feel the baked sweat of his favourite officer class still on the nozzle.

I learned that friends can judge us so harshly that you might feel like you have nowhere to turn. I made the very difficult decision to try to work through this thing with my boyfriend, for a myriad of reasons. Some of them perhaps more valid than others, but so what? I had some friends who made me feel like such crap for taking him back, and that was the last thing I needed.
As a young girl, I felt like an outcast in my father's life. He had numerous women, and I felt like I always took a far distant third...job first...new fling second...me...oh yeah, the girlfriend comes to get me for the weekend. He rarely called me to check in. He barely saw me but two times out of the year--holidays, summer. By the time my father married and had two more children, I was 11, and I knew then it would be up to me to carry the relationship, so I did. I called him with exciting news. I made the investment in us. I wanted to believe I had a dad, so I told myself if I proved my worth to him, he would want me, he would love me. When I started college, near where he lived, the time we had to get together increased. I even lived with him one summer in between the school year. We really got to know each other, I got to know his new children and his wife. I felt comfortable with our relationship, I loved my dad. I felt like he loved

Ultimately, you and I include myself in this and have to tell myself this every day, have to value yourself and your work. Writing is not a skill everyone has, no matter what they say. Some people may be hesitant to share their rates with you but you will find them out in time, and it’ll always work best if you remind people that you’re not looking to undercut the market.
Moshe received the Torah at Sinai and handed it to Yehoshu’a, Yehoshu’a to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, and the Prophets handed it on to the men of the Great Assembly. They said three things: Be careful in judgment, raise up many disciples, and make a fence for the Torah (Pirqei Avot, 1:1)
If the “Seven Deadly Sins” are all that deadly, why is it so enlivening to stuff our faces in Grant Park, admire ourselves in South Beach, bet the house at Caesars Palace, surf ESPN channels in Indianapolis, hate the Giants at Eagles games, flip someone the bird on Michigan Avenue and casually copulate in Oregon?

My public sector sabbatical employer develops housing for formerly chronically homeless people, most recently Bud Clark Commons, the snazzy modernist building near the train station. The people who live there, by and large, were on the streets for a long time. It’s tough to be so poor. It’s physically and emotionally and mentally demanding hard. These folks could use respite, and calm. Yoga and meditation bring those things to people. All people.

I love this big poinsettia stamp from Penny Black called Christmas Pride. I embossed it in white, coloured it with Distress Inks and sprayed it with Perfect Pearls. The background was colored with Distress Inks in Tumbled Glass and Broken China and sprayed with Perfect Pearls. Yup, everything is a-shimmering! Finally I added the sentiment on a piece of vellum.

Most of my knitting and hooking happens in the living room on the sofa but sewing is different. Sewing needs it's own special place. All those sharp scissors and needles, and cutters......yes, they definitely need storing away in a safe place with all these interested little ones around. So where is this sewing space? Well it's here:
Just as my Guv quite possibly saved my sanity in my darkest hours and is still my baby who i adore (sure he may be demon possessed but still!), this cat played a similar role in my friend's life.
I commit myself to walking in the face of all my doubt, to push myself to walk and work with writing and self forgiveness daily in the face of my doubt and everything within myself telling me that I will fail, that It is certain that I will fail, and in this to bring myself to a point where I am able to let go of this fighting and struggle and allow myself to walk in and as flow within the decision to support myself as life and letting go completely of past patterns of self abuse, instead of trying to do both.

She did everything wrong. And in doing everything wrong, she hurt a lot of people. I know it could not have been easy for her. A lifetime identity is being overturned and a new one is being born. But the difficulty of a journey does not give a person the right to harm others along the way.

The pair quickly recognized the seriousness of the matter and immediately contacted RECO. Within a few hours, the urgency of the investigation became clear as RECO’s Manager of Inspections & Investigations, Brian Prendergast, determined that the transaction was fraudulent and put a face to the fraud’s victim: an elderly minister who had no idea that a fraudster was trying to sell his house without his knowledge.
Well, I wasn't sure if I was ever going to come back and update this blog. Mainly because of the difficulty in finding the joy that used to be in my heart in regards to entering sweepstakes and posting here since my Mom passed away last year. Today in fact would have been my Mom and Dad's 47th wedding anniversary, so my Mom (as always) has been strongly on my mind to say the least.
Rick Santorum said some crazy ass things today.

Oh most of the left wing media will continue to ignore all of his insanity, and the right wing media will continue to ignore his life-long act that seems hell bent on restoring the Soviet Union here in America…but you know with an added theocracy flavor.

I was enraptured by Build A Man from the very first page and could not put it down until I had finished the last page. The writing flowed so well that even if I had wanted to stop I don't think I would have been able to. The concept, as with all Talli Roland's novels, was so unique and different from the usual chick lit novels. I loved the idea of Build A Man and the quirky little elements that were added along the way. You can always count on Talli to bring a creative twist to her books. I would love to be inside her head for just one day to see how she comes up with all her ideas. I also enjoyed the message and the moral dilema behind the story in Build A Man, with Serenity using her professional position as the cosemtic surgery clinic in order to gain juicy details for her column. Then later on in the story Serenity's conscience coming into play with whether or not she should be doing that or not.

“Mom, I know this is hard for you, but it’s not easy for us either,” Claire put her hand on her mother’s frail, pointy shoulder. Kathleen twitched slightly. Claire hadn’t touched her like this in years. When she was little Claire was such an affectionate child, always wrapping herself around her mother’s legs. She needed to have her lower back rubbed gently to fall asleep. Somewhere in her teen years they had stopped hugging, almost stopped looking at each other. She drifted far away in her world of calculators and granite counter tops and indulgent motherhood.

I'm not sure if it was the Placebo effect or if the Vitamin D/Gluten Free diet really did help jumpstart my mind again, but I finally began to feel a bit better. Everyday I was gaining more energy. I wanted to do more. To see more. To reengage with the world. I felt like I had more control over my body. My emotions. And that I was "myself" again.
For the uninitiated I won’t delve into story details much further, because the mid-story twist might sort of work for some people, even if I find it to be largely unengaging. No points will be awarded for guessing that the Kraal invasion involves androids, and the title of the serial is somewhat emblematic of its bigger problems: the whole thing just seems rather ordinary, or it descends into a sort of tedium as it moves along, anyway. Episode One is actually rather nice, being an exploration of the oft-talked about “spooky English village” concept, but things start quickly falling apart in the second episode, and it’s as if the more you find out, the less you care to know.

I pulled into an overlook and sat in the warm sun basking like the painted turtles I had watched earlier.I took off my shirt and lay back dreaming, wondering who first found this pristine area and called it home.I spent the rest of the day in a daydream, as I often do, and headed down to my other home to mow and tend the yard a bit. I had brought all my laundry to do also and set it in the basement. My friend stopped over and we ran out to get a pizza and steak at our favorite little town nearby and I came home pretty exhausted.I sat back and was lost in a dream, waking to hear her typing away on one of the many computers. She asked,"What is in your clothes making all that racket?" I sat up hearing a thud every once and a while.She told me she had started another load and I laughed, forgetting to empty ones pockets can be tough on a dryer. In this case it was my recorder, less than two weeks old. Hmmmmm I wonder if that is under warranty. She left before I was back up and I was grateful to have had some help at least, my first few loads were all folded and hung up, a task I really don't like to do.

If you are so late the book can't be dragged back onto schedule, the publisher might miss the slot booked to print the book.

As I was walking out from my office at the end of last week, my coworkers started to mumble about the raise in cafeteria prices. With a sensitive and recent across-the-board salary reduction, people were a lot less receptive to paying $1 more on average for a mediocre semi-prepackaged processed hospital lunch. With a drink and two baby overcooked sides, the cafeteria meal can average as much as $8.00. With one whimsical comment, a new idea and opportunity was born.

I've had a bit of a chesty cough and a sore throat for a few days, and during that time I've not really enjoyed a pint. I can only assume my taste buds have been affected, because even beers I usually like have seemed fairly tasteless to me. So I'm off to do my Easter Quiz at the Bothy shortly, and I doubt I'll bother having a pint at all. I also won't be giving a song as my singing voice is all croaky, although my speaking voice sounds fairly normal. Going to a folk song club in a real ale venue has lost a lot of its point.
Last night two women called in sick so they asked Christine to play. Like me, she is not an athletic person. She never hits the ball, but they have to have a certain number of women to play so she had to do it. She missed every ball thrown at her and each time would yell to the pitcher, "Sorry!" He told her she didn't have to do that.

Since losing my husband to suicide just over 10 years ago now, I’ve learned that everyone handles death and grief differently. I’ve learned to respect everyone exactly where they are in that moment in their journey of grief. Some are very open discussing their loss, others absolutely silent about it. I do not pry if they don’t want to discuss it, just offer my condolences and let them know I’m there to listen should they feel so inclined. I have also learned that grief is part of the healing process, it comes to each of us differently, but needs to occur in order to move forward. Pain most often accompanies grief, so it too must be gone through to start the journey, so waving my wand if I had one, would not really be beneficial.
When we get a life-altering revelation of how much we are loved and forgiven, then we are on the road to eliminating the critical spirit. When we see how much mercy we have been given, then we will give mercy. Of course, this does not mean that we are ignoring problems that need to be addressed; but we will do so from a spirit of love and wholeness, and not from a ‘critical spirit.’”

Since I started dating Trooper, I've been worried about the relationship's affect on this blog.

This is what led me to my latest wardrobe dilemma…what to wear when the only 2 pairs of pants that fit are in the laundry! No one commented on, or even looked askance, at the black jeans I wore with my heels and jacket…but I really need to either lose weight or buy new clothes!
I suppose our only hope is that this 'advertising' propaganda begins to provoke a real backlash as it becomes more and more heavy-handed and incessant.

I will tell you now, that I could not do what I do here for you if I did not, myself, from time to time, go to one of Christ’s priests, confess my own sins, and hear those words, “I absolve you…” I do not know why so many people think that confession is strictly a Roman Catholic thing- just for them. Anyone who knows the Ordinal of the Church of England must know that the priestly power to absolve, to forgive sins, has always been a very important part of Anglican practice. We never abandoned it.

Once inside the birthing room, the anesthesia people came. I sort of considered the idea to not go for the epidural since I was so far along already, but when they told me that pushing may take up to 3-4 hours, I quickly decided to go for it. My back labor was not bearable at this point. Also, all signs pointed to a large baby, thus pushing would not be easy.
There has been many times in the last three months that I have thought that many of you reading this blog are insane. Not because you’re reading this. Not because I’ve had mostly positive remarks.

While Sherri, Mia, and Sam were touring the Guinness Storehouse and having their picture taken with Sir Arthur, Margaret, Mary Kate, and I did a bit of walking. I wanted to get a picture of the Ha’Penny Bridge and the Four Courts. So we hoofed it all the way back over to Temple Bar and I took the pictures below.
The real story of this painting, according to Jody, is that "the guy" lives in that red house. The female figure is a dragon (the Satanic wings do indeed look dragon-like) and "the guy" is going back into his house to get away from the dragon. The thing around the guy's head (the halo) is a "weird hat." I think this is either a testament to Jody's interpretive skills, the artist's ability, or both, in that Jody was able to come so close to the painting's "meaning" without the benefit of any of the back story. Jody also described the setting (dessert) as "ancient," which he later explained means "beautiful."
My pack has a few small pockets, which I prefer to one large one. This way I was able to sort my supplies and grab what I needed quickly and easily. In the top pocket, I kept my sour mints and stick sunscreen. Two concert necessities, as far as I'm concerned. I don't even like sour candies, but when you're hot and sticky, they just make everything better. And stick sunscreen stays on much better when you're constantly mopping your face.

Kitten’s First Full Moon, by Kevin Henkes. I LOOOOOVE this book! I actually purchased it for my own daughter before I became a children’s librarian, and it’s one of her favorites! I introduced it by reminding the kids that a kitten is a baby cat, and a full moon looks like a big circle. Since Kitten is a baby, she has never seen a full moon before, so she doesn’t quite know what to make of it. Of course they laughed like crazy on the first page when they heard that Kitten thought that the moon was a big bowl of milk! Throughout the book, Kitten jumps, runs, and climbs in her efforts to reach “that little bowl of milk in the sky,” but to no avail! This book is just so cute, and the kids really enjoyed it.
