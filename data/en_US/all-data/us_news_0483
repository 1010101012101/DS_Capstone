American liberals wake up every morning thinking about all the suffering and injustice they could alleviate if only the public sector didn't have to scrape by with 32% of our gross domestic product. The trouble is, Sweden's social democrats wake up every morning thinking about all the suffering and injustice they could alleviate if only their public sector weren't forced to scrape by with 55% of GDP -- and American liberals have little to say about what they find objectionable or excessive about this Scandinavian model.

Compare the nuanced indirection of "Man on Wire" with the full-frontal assault of "United 93," Paul Greengrass' sober, respectful but ultimately one-dimensional feature film about the passengers who wrested control of one of the hijacked planes that ended up crashing in rural Pennsylvania. Although admirably accurate and even-handed in its documentary-like marshaling of facts, "United 93" fails to elevate its subject beyond the level of a historical reenactment. It monumentalizes the heroic passengers and depicts the hijackers without judgment — but also without illuminating them as people.
When the quake hits, the inflexible concrete columns holding the fifth floor's ceiling aloft develop hairline cracks. The heavy ceiling, supporting the floor above, finally slides down the bisected columns, like a heavy child down a playground slide. When it strikes the floor below, the fourth floor's columns fail. And on like that it goes. To an observer, it resembles a scale model of the World Trade Center collapsing -- floors pancaking down, with lives between the layers. Neighbors crawl over the rubble, digging frantically with their hands. Nearby, flames flicker from a crushed stove where moments earlier a father was making scrambled eggs for his children.

Multnomah County runs the second-largest corrections operation in Oregon behind only the state prison system, with two jails that house about 1,300 inmates. No other sheriff's office devotes such a large proportion of its operations to running jails, according to the Oregon State Sheriffs' Association. Where the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office at one time provided policing for 200,000 residents, it now does so for about 17,000. Yet even as the duties have shifted, the elected sheriffs come from a law enforcement -- not corrections -- background.

Of course, those who don't like the look are told they don't "get it" because the approach is tailored to impressionable teens.

Somehow, it doesn't seem to have affected recruiting. If a program truly believes uniforms will make a difference in its recruiting, then its success is more superficial than most would care to admit. Truman gets a thumbs down on this one.

No league in the world is more saturated by media coverage than the NFL and as soon as each player is drafted, he must do a conference call with the local media covering that team. Days later, he meets with them again in person at a press conference at the team's facility. Then again at rookie mini-camp. Then again in the fall, etc. If you can't talk to the local media where clearly you were successful enough to even turn pro, you probably won't last five seconds in front of the media in an NFL city.
As a studious girl in a small Italian town, Giulia Giupponi drew no inspiration from the women on the glowing box in her living room. The ones who giggled and jiggled while wearing next to nothing.

Also, ask your reps to back a plan to beef up FDA inspections of generic drug plants here and overseas (where 40 percent of drugs and 80 percent of active ingredients are now made). Money is no excuse. The generic-drug industry itself has offered to put up $300 million for it.

There's more rapping than usual, Jake Shear extolling the virtues of a recent conquest with "She gon' vote for Obama, and she likes to dance to Madonna."

The bedrock problem, as Brennan rightly notes, is that America is setting standards for a world in which dozens of countries will soon have drones. What if the Chinese deployed drones to protect their workers in southern Sudan against rebels who have killed them in past attacks? What if Iran used them against Kurdish separatists they regard as terrorists? What if Russia used them over Chechnya? What position would the U.S. take, and wouldn't it be hypocritical if it opposed drone attacks by other nations that face "imminent" or "significant" threats?

After a friend prayed with him and urged him to repent while he was awaiting trial in 1973, the skeptic who once scoffed at "foxhole religion" found himself alone and weeping in his car, overwhelmed by the sudden knowledge of his need to live for more than pride or political power.

This suggests that even if College Park and UMB merged, their research funding data might still be treated separately in the Center for Measuring University Performance's national rankings. The center's research director, Craig Abbey, told me that factors such as geographic distance between units, a tradition of separate reporting, separate faculty groupings, and governance arrangements are all considered. He illustrated this with examples of "flagship campus-medical institutions" combinations that are each treated in the rankings as two distinct universities. These were the University of Oklahoma (22 miles between the Norman campus and the Oklahoma City medical campus), the University of Kansas (40 miles between the Lawrence campus and the Kansas City medical campus), and the University of Nebraska (56 miles between the Lincoln campus and the Omaha medical campus). In all three examples, a single president was CEO for both campuses combined, but each of the two constituent campuses also had its own CEO serving under the single president.

ø"I think we all should have gone to school for a year or two," says Evans, who is pursuing an economics degree. "I think we got the wrong message. We were supposed to be the next great generation.

R. Thomas' Deluxe Grill (1812 Peachtree St. N.W.; [404] 872-2942, http://www.rthomasdeluxegrill.net) is a longtime Atlanta vegan favorite. Decorated with Chinese paper lanterns, bamboo curtains, seashell wind chimes and a chirping canary, the restaurant is more aptly described as outdoor seating in a heated tent. Its menu has offerings as diverse as tempeh (a soy-based meat substitute often used in things such as vegan burgers and bacon) and quinoa (a South American "supergrain" with a texture like couscous) served 24 hours a day. We showed up at 6 one morning and found that the Thai Express — a bowl of quinoa topped with sautéed broccoli, red cabbage, carrots, scallion and cilantro in a spicy peanut sauce — was a delicious breakfast choice. When we ordered, John Vo, a manager, who has been at R. Thomas for 19 years, said: "Laughter is still the best medicine, but quinoa is a close second." No argument from us.

But wait, the album fans among you are saying: Didn't you just note that sales of digital albums rose 53%? Sure seems like a heartbeat to me. Well, not so fast. According to Nielsen Soundscan, last year, 844.2 million digital tracks were sold, compared with just 50 million digital albums. That's 17 to 1. In 1994, by comparison, the industry sold 615 million albums and 99 million singles. Moreover, digital-album sales have consistently been more weighted to catalog and "deep catalog" items (generally speaking, releases more than 18 months old) than sales of physical CDs, and catalog and deep-catalog sales have shown stronger growth. While digital music does boost the "long tail" effect, I think those numbers are evidence that digital-album sales are being driven by consumers updating their music collections, which says more about music's past than its future. (And if I'm right, that's still more evidence that ripping CDs is too much fuss for many folks.)
