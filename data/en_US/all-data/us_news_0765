When you get to the place, you will stand in a line, usually curving down the block, that moves much faster than you think. You will need a paper menu to study.

_ EUROPE IN THE WORLD: The world still admires French art, Italian food and Spanish soccer. But in the global economy, sluggish Europe is looking less attractive when compared to fast-growing emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil. That's a blow to the ego of a continent accustomed to seeing itself as having a central place in history. The European Union's seemingly endless debt crisis has seriously damaged confidence in its common currency project. Bickering between nations has also tarnished Europe's self-image as a role model of how nations can come together to build peace and prosperity.

Hmm. I don’t think I could trust a man who doesn’t eat red meat! I mean, for men, isn’t it their animalistic nature to crave red meat? I don’t know. I wouldn’t be able to do it, either. Especially if you’re a carnivore yourself.

Every money-saving tip should begin with cutting back on nonessentials. When tightening a budget, you might consider dining out less or drinking less Starbucks coffee. Keep this up and there will be a noticeable amount of money accumulated by the end of the year. Our government spends a lot of money on unimportant causes that, if eliminated would not only save money, but would provide peace-of-mind to taxpayers, showing that their money wasn't going to waste. According to a report by CBS News, the United States government shelled out $10 million to remake a Pakistani version of the show Sesame Street. On the CBS News website, there are many other outrageous cases. I believe our government needs to prioritize its spending and eliminate funding on low-priority or completely irrelevant projects.

A: I think it's more of a case of caveat emptor. When buying tickets for late-season games you either have the chance to see teams desperately fight for playoff position or rest their stars once already locked in. It's like buying a ticket for Week 17 in the NFL, instead of Peyton Manning you might get Curtis Painter. I can tell you that you probably won't be getting LeBron James or Dwyane Wade on your television over these final two regular-season games, so I guess that will have you also suing Comcast or DirecTV?

Delay your taxes: Regardless what happens with tax policy changes, the one for-sure deadline on Roths is that 2010 is the only opportunity to delay your tax payments on the conversion and spread them over two years. Make the switch now and you can either claim the income from the conversion on your 2010 tax return due next April or split it between your 2011 and 2012 returns. Spreading out the tax burden also may help you avoid a one-time bump to a higher bracket because of the conversion.

Chances of finding duck done perfectly is a lot like a trip to a shooting gallery. The chef deserves a prize for his Muscovy duck breast ($29), roasted rosy with orange. The medallions are served on a bed of al dente farro speckled with blueberries and a Grand Marnier reduction. One bite of the lamb shanks -- Agnello con Fagioli e Scarola ($31) -- makes you question why that humble cut doesn't garner more spots on menus.

Hey, Tony: 1.) Do you see Evan Moore being used more after the bye? It seems to me they need to be able to stretch the field and I think Moore could help the running game by getting the safety out of the box. 2.) How has Pinkston graded out at guard through the first four games? I know Week One was a little tough on him, but I haven't heard his name mentioned since then ... which I think is good, if he's not being mentioned, he's not making glaring mistakes. -- Andy, Richmond, Va.
So far, Rams officials haven't said whether they believe the team should pay for any "first tier" improvements, although that issue is expected to be addressed in the team's counteroffer.
In Florida, an Army vet is struggling with bureaucracy after being declared dead. You'd think he'd be used to this because it's the fourth time it's happened to him in two years. Every time it happens his pension stops until he convinces the feds he's alive, and we all know how quick and easy it is to straighten out money matters with the government. Worst of all, this kind of thing happens all the time: The story says 1 in every 200 deaths reported is false. So carpe diem, people, for tomorrow the feds could declare you dead.

But at this point, it looks like the Indianapolis Colts are the luckiest team on the planet. With Peyton Manning's brilliant 14-year career winding down, in large part because of neck issues, the Colts - with the No. 1 overall pick - have the opportunity to draft a Manning clone.

Free candy factory tours reveal real people — as opposed to Willy Wonka's Oompa Loompas — crafting signature caramel-coated marshmallows, striped candy canes, shimmering ribbon candy and more.
It was a fantastic way to grow up. The only negative about that was that we were not educated in sun protection. We all thought being in the sun was very healthy. If you had a cold the word was, "get out in the sun and get some vitamin C." If you were tan it was considered "healthy looking." We were completely unaware of the dangers of constant exposure to the sun.
Still, she’s unsure how the verdict will reshape the idea of hate crimes and being biased, to act with spite and ill will toward others.
Economists had blamed the decline in part on temporary factors. The crisis in Japan caused a parts shortage for some U.S. automakers. High fuel prices left consumers with less money to spend on discretionary goods, such as appliances and furniture.

And so Prince Fielder, 27, made his debut on his own Thursday afternoon, the opening day of the season, and with his first at-bat he muscled a single into right-center, and with his last at-bat, he sacrificed in a run, and he was officially in the local books, wearing the Detroit uniform that another Fielder once adorned.

At least half of those staples and tacks ended up on the floor, which was a hodgepodge of mismatched linoleum and tile pieces stapled together. Debbie calls it "the Frankenstein floor." It does look like what the good doctor would've created at a Lowe's in Transylvania.
Later, cruising on Pamushana's boat with Turner toward a herd of elephants that just emerged from the Malilangwe bush to drink at the edge of one of the few dams of this size set aside purely for private use, I find it hard to fathom why anyone would want to tamper with, let alone destroy, this relatively pristine forest.
"We are pleased that we are able to honor the debt that we have incurred and to honor the creditors who are due their payment," she said in a statement. "To pay them back 100 percent has always been a top priority and we are grateful to God for providing the resources to be able to do just that."

Perhaps the most striking piece denied to Angelenos remains missing from the show in Qatar — a gold- and silk-embroidered Turkish tent from the 1700s that was a gift to Catherine the Great. Komaroff said that even before the ban came down, she and her counterparts at the Hermitage had been wrestling with how to set the tent up properly while on tour. In St. Petersburg it has a custom-made aluminum and plexiglass support grid that couldn't be transported, and in the end, she said, the Hermitage decided not to let it travel.

Part of the Maryland football problem: a $50.8 million modernization of its stadium in which too many luxury suites remain unsold. Another problem: The school reportedly paid $2 million to buy out head coach Ralph Friedgen at the end of the 2010 season, even though he led his team to a 9-and-4 season and was named Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year. Then, the school reportedly spent another $2 million to hire Randy Edsall from the University of Connecticut, who promptly produced a record of 2-and-10 last season.

Mr. Netanyahu has spoken of Iran as a dire threat; Mr. Lieberman, a rival of the conservative prime minister in a coalition government, often uses more extreme language.

The pressures of a successful acting career created all sorts of opportunities for the drill sergeant, particularly when De Rossi was a regular on the hit TV show "Ally McBeal" — which in retrospect seems as much a visual compendium of eating disorders as it does a television series. Costume fittings were a particular torment, and the actress recalls one morning in particular when she had beaten herself up all the way to the set because she imagined she'd found a wrinkle of fat on her stomach. Upon arrival, she discovered the day's episode would require her to wear revealing lingerie and perform a striptease.

When I was a kid, I sent a short story to Roald Dahl, care of his publishers, about a six-foot-tall frog named Herman who loved peanut butter. And somehow that story found its way to Dahl in England. He sent me back a postcard. It's dated 24th August '72, and says, "Dear April, I loved your story about Herman the frog. I read it aloud to my daughter, Ophelia, who also loved it. I read it to my secretary, Hazel, who giggled. Lots of love, Roald Dahl." It's amazing that he committed this act of kindness for one of what must surely have been a flood of scribbled missives. Dahl even took the shared the story with the editor of a British children's magazine. She contacted me and asked to publish it. But even before she did, I already knew that I was a real writer. Because Roald Dahl had told me so.
This area is known for desert bighorn sheep, Nevada's state animal. We were lucky to spot an impressively horned male, which shared his space with us for a bit — at one point, he was as close as 15 or 20 feet — before he disappeared into the rocks. You might also see ground squirrels, rabbits, antelope, coyotes, wild burros, lizards, chuckwallas, Gila monsters and, of course, rattlesnakes (pay attention to where you walk) and a plethora of birds.
"I wish we had treated jobs the way we treated this debt ceiling, which was a bit of a manufactured crisis, which jobs isn't. So what if we got everyone together and said let's set a deadline to figure out how you actually create jobs in this country.

Winning the Oscar for best foreign-language film is a mixed blessing. As a marketing tool, it's intended to hook serious American film fans interested in "the best movie in the world" that wasn't made in English, and implies intellectual gravity, unconventional storytelling and refreshed perspectives. Those same serious American film fans, however, are well aware that Academy voters tend to reward sentimentality, convention, and lessons in morality that make them feel good about themselves. Also, children. And a little sex never hurts.

That said, residents have been burned by failed government in the past. Detroiters are facing extremely tough challenges and smart decisions are critical, but there is understandably very little trust. Charts, graphs and spreadsheets used to prove action is necessary dont always rank above challenges like feeding the kids or stretching a Social Security check. Not everyone is going to be able to focus on fixing the city. We cant expect everyone to have an in-depth and nuanced understanding of the function of government, policy and urban planning.

Interestingly, 45% of Latino respondents wanted the court to uphold the Arizona law, while 43% hoped it would be overturned.

Even if it does, reversing decades of environmental degradation to air, land and soil -- a challenge that predates the Communists, let alone the Wild West market economy -- will be a daunting task. China, by any standard, has too little clean water, too much garbage and too much air pollution. It's one thing to halt clear-cutting of forests or to shutter the dirtiest factories; another to repair decades of damage.

Now it appears that he wants a full-time career separate from the band. Facts are skecthy, but Fox News reported that the members of Aerosmith not named Tyler (Perry, guitarist Brad Whitford, bassist Tom Hamilton, and drummer Joey Kramer) plan to meet to discuss whether replacing him is in the best interest of the band. Perry, who also has a steady solo career, seems ready to dump his batterymate. He told the Las Vegas Sun that the band will probably find someone to fill in for the legendary singer, whose elastic mouth and onstage energy have defined the group as much as its sound. "We’ll be able to move the Aerosmith up a notch, move the vibe up a notch," he said.

One model, which assumes an average 9 percent annual return on the investment, shows the university's distribution from the endowment climbing from $64 million in the first year to $99 million by year 10 and to $162 million by year 20.

The results are also familiar from bad marriages. Both sides want to win, to be proven right, to make the other eat humble pie, and to bypass compromise out of a sense of self-righteous certainty. We hear the word "ideology" applied a lot to the most rigid partisans on the left and the right. But I think ideology is a mask for being a bad spouse. This marriage will never work when one or both spouses insists on getting their own way, no matter what.

Banks get a piece of the action, too, with a few in particular dominating the tax credit trade. Commerce Bank and U.S. Bancorp each buy and sell tens of millions of dollars worth of historic and other development tax credits every year. So did National City Bank, until it was bought last year by PNC Financial. These banks often accept credits from a developer as repayment for construction loans at one price - say, 84 cents on the dollar - then sell them to individual taxpayers or accountants at another, maybe 92 cents.

The Nuggets are shooting a respectable 73 percent from the line in the series, though, and those shots are most important on the road.

Questions about his credibility arose in connection with conflicting statements Epperson made under oath in several pre-trial hearings in that case.

A couple of things you are allowed to prune: grasses and deciduous trees. If you have ornamental grasses in your yard, such as certain Muhlenbergia species or grama grasses (Bouteloua spp.), cut back to the ground to rejuvenate. Some, such as deer grass, should be left alone. A rule of thumb for the grasses is "if it's brown, mow it down; if it's green, let it be seen." Deciduous trees can be reduced and thinned around mid-month.

I have no doubt Wayne Gretzky would be a Great One in this era. No. 99 would have figured it out. But he would not have been able to carry the puck across the line and make his signature buttonhook move while waiting for his teammates to find openings for him to exploit the way he did back in the day — because there simply is no time and no space for that anymore.

The financial implications of the decision are monumental. Metro is pretty much tapped out at this point. With its light rail project running three to four times the cost estimated in 2003, Metro's total liabilities have quadrupled since 2005 from about $400 million to more than $1.6 billion. Last year, for the first time in its history, Metro showed a negative working capital. The working capital deficit would have increased to more than $100 million this year had it not reclassified its commercial paper debt as a noncurrent liability.

"The run game is a lot of people," Spagnuolo said. "It's ten minus the quarterback because all he does is hand it off. It's the running back and the guys blocking for him, so people have to do a little bit better of a job blocking. I'm sure Steven, being the prideful guy he is, probably says that he needs to do a couple of things better and piece it together and we get a little bit more effective."
The McCluer South-Berkeley front seven has been a thorn in the side of opponents all season long. Time and time again, the Bulldogs have proven capable of putting QBs on their backs. Trevor McGraw has eight sacks on the season, while Keandra Simms has registered five.

Olson told me later he and his Disney colleagues helped coordinate the relocation of numerous sea turtles from east-central Florida's frigid Indian River Lagoon to warmer ocean waters in South Florida during January's prolonged cold weather. Part of the money for that effort and others like it comes from the $175 admission fee for each DiveQuest customer. Olson estimates DiveQuest has contributed more than $14 million to the Disney Wildlife Conservation Fund.

It all might have been better left in Katims' hands. Having written some of most believably human relationship dramas on TV, including "My So-Called Life," "Friday Night Lights" and the wonderful complications of the current "Parenthood," he might have been able to pull this off. Kohn and Silverstein, on the other hand, have teamed for a string of unsatisfying lite romantic comedies, including "He's Just Not That Into You" and last year's "Valentine's Day" mush.

Hoving, whom Parker describes as "this classically trained art historian who had been liberated by the '60s,'' set out to make the staid Met "a more visitor-responsive museum, hipper, more energized. Still dedicated to connoisseurship, still dedicated to quality, still receptive to scholars, still acquiring esoteric objects, putting on exhibitions, all the things that museum people had been educated to do, as a kind of elite activity. But now, on top of that, you also had to be populist and responsive, and go to the boroughs and send out exhibitions and teach in different languages. The world was changing, and established institutions were required to be more relevant to everyday life. The NEA was just starting and the New York State Council on the Arts was also just beginning, and those entities were very interested in new audiences, diversifying the audience, and all the issues that have become the issues of my life.''

The fragment is the lower portion of a warrior figure, which would have been one of several monumental columns holding up a temple roof. Side by side, the stiff, ramrod-straight legs allow no space to separate them, visually creating a near-solid mass. Their bulk, interrupted only by the faintest shadows from slight mounds suggesting knees, is further enhanced by square-cut toes and rectilinear contours. The geometric shapes make them appear to have been cut from an impassive, immovable block.

Yes, there are differences between Baylor and TCU and Houston and UCLA. But the idea that Baylor, with state-of-the- art facilities and a pas- sionate alumni base, and UH, with tremendous potential and an impressive tradition, should not be in the mix for conference championships on the same level as TCU and UCLA (and Texas and Texas A&M, for that matter) isn't right.

As a physician, it concerns me to see interest groups aligned with our profession focus more on protecting negligent doctors than on reducing preventable medical errors. Increasing patient safety will lead to a large reduction in health care costs. The Institute of Medicine estimates there are 98,000 deaths annually due to preventable medical errors in hospitals. These errors increase health care costs by $29 billion per year, more than five times the savings that would supposedly come from limiting patients’ rights. We need to reduce health care costs for Georgians and can do so by reducing preventable medical errors. We can’t afford to allow special interests to distract our policymakers from this important mission.

The book's final chapter explores not only the nature of games, but also the nature of Bissell. He writes that he started playing the game Grand Theft Auto IV at the same time that he started using cocaine. His first drug-fueled joyride lasted 30 hours. He no longer uses the drug, but he plays video games constantly, preferring them to the books that were once central to his life. Now, he writes, he finds that "the pleasures of literary connection seem leftover and familiar"; now that games have overtaken his once-bookish existence, he has "no firm memory of who, or what, I once was." Perhaps Bissell has suffered a grand theft of his own: a loss of his previous life in favor of the "extra lives" onscreen. His love has proven dangerously intoxicating.

The Boycott has to be so widespread and devastating that the Arizona State Legislature and Governor have no choice but to repeal their unconstitutional, immoral and hateful law. It has to hurt them in the only place they feel any pain, their pocketbooks."

At the end of the hallway, push back the gauzy black curtains and step elegantly and carefully from dimness into darkness  flickering votive candles on tables tops are practically the only lighting source in the room.

øBreazeale, like King, dreams big. He has "Go for Gold" written on the bathroom mirror of his apartment in Anaheim, and he aches to be a part of King's quest to restore boxing.
The board did not concur in every denial, and the statute grants the citizen reviewers the power to overrule the superintendent of the state police — a power seldom found in state or federal law. However, in most cases our decision was unanimous, and in all cases without exception during my tenure, the bi-partisan board found the MSP investigation respectful and thorough, and the grounds for denial compelling, even when we disagreed.

But after narrowly outscoring Miami's second unit in Saturday's 33-point, Game 1 loss, New York's bench scored just 19 points in the Game 2 loss. Novak attempted only five field goals, making three of them, and Smith scored 13 points on 6-of-11 shooting. That's not a bad game for Smith, but the Heat bench had two 11-point scorers last night (Shane Battier and Mike Miller), which is why Miami's reserves outscored New York's by six points.

A: The euro made it easier to do business across Europe and made the continent a potent economic bloc. Yet the experiment was flawed. Countries were harnessed to one another despite different economies and cultures but still managed their own finances. As long as prosperity reigned, banks were happy to lend at low rates even to weaker countries like Greece. The euro meant lenders didn't have to worry about inflation in individual countries. Greece and others exploited the opening by borrowing heavily to finance their swelling budgets. But once the Great Recession hit hard, their debt proved crushing.
"Initially we didn't want to put the number on," Jensen recalls, "and then after about 10 years of doing that, people would say, 'Oh, this is just a table wine,' and I'd say, 'This is our best wine!' And so we started putting alcohol numbers on."

Nishikawa has yet to take a side on the restart issue, but Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto lashed out at the government for declaring the Ohi plant safe without first getting a go-ahead from its own nuclear regulators, who have purportedly been given more responsibility for reactor safety by legislation spurred by last year's disaster. Hashimoto told Japan's NHK network Monday that Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda would provoke a government crisis if he forged ahead with the Ohi restart in spite of the strong fear still driving popular resistance to returning to nuclear power reliance.

Yes, Englewood can be rough, but mainly for its predominantly African-American residents.
Now, I've never met Maroulis, but I've heard of her legend. She's a three-time U.S. Open champion, and was the top seed at 55 kilograms in the trials. Campbell had never beaten her, and as she said, "There wasn't any reason for the average Joe to think I'd upset the No. 1 seed."

Not only are Wild Mango's rooms lovely little galleries in which you can escape, Wei's dishes have an intriguing sculptural quality, often constructed with the sort of gravity-defying improbability as a desert rock formation: a filet of salmon placed upon a tower of sticky rice; or a curlicue explosion of rice noodles on a refreshingly dressed Vietnamese salad strewn with halved egg rolls and jazzy grilled shrimp; or a porcupinelike stand of fried vermicelli in the center of deliciously sweet-crunch Pepsi shrimp, all set in a crispy salsalike salad. Then he'll play it safe, such as a sextet of absolutely luscious chicken-stuffed pot stickers lined up on a narrow rectangular plate -- just beware those dots of red, fiery sauce, that decorate. Even a safe-sounding pesto chicken, consisting of a pair of juicy breasts, bursts with fresh flavor. Then comes a piece de resistance: The chef sets a heavy paper cone atop a burner and fills it with an exquisitely subtle broth in which floats barely seared sushi-grade tuna slices and scallops dabbed with pesto. A coconut milk-laced risotto studded with tiny dice of tomato, cucumber and shrimp accompanies. Few combinations rival it for sheer cunning, visual impact and pure deliciousness.
Striking out two before concluding with a harmless fly ball, closer Fernando Salas pitched a perfect ninth inning for his 15th save in 17 chances.
I tested Ancestry.com, its iPhone and iPad apps and the Family Tree Maker desktop software on a Mac.

"The thought that these allegations occurred over such a long period of time (allegedly from 1994 through 2008) and people had the opportunity to do the right thing to stop it, makes you sick," Rosa said. "There's a sense that you talked the talk, but you didn't walk it. This cocoon that has been built around the program, someone took a match and just lit it up. You can't run and hide from this stuff."

Michael Foods is working with customers who purchased eggs from these lots to ensure that all product is removed from the market. Consumers who believe they might have purchased product affected by the recall, or those who are unsure, should contact the original place of purchase.
The Chronicle investigation revealed that two-thirds of the 174 safety studies of land-based pipelines that the federal agency has started in the past decade were largely funded by pipeline operators or organizations they control. That's because the agency has required that, in most cases, at least half the funding for its pipeline safety research come from outside sources - a policy the Obama administration is now promising to change.

This proposal is better than the current status quo, where a generation of children is living in the shadows of our society.

Rating: TWO AND A HALF STARS NV Roederer Estate Anderson Valley Brut ($22) This Mendocino offshoot of the Champagne house delivers a remarkable wine for the money, outpacing many Champagnes. Widely available, this latest bottling is fresh and leesy, with green apple and crushed rock aromas. Buoyant acidity and squeezed orange flavors mix with wild berry. The bubbles are refined and the body is ample enough to avoid sharpness while maintaining a precise edge.
For instance, one person I hired with close to 20 years of experience actually closed a deal without collecting money from a client. You can't close any transaction without funds. I've hired experienced people who didn't know the laws that are critical to our industry. Either they didn't understand or they didn't care about the effect on a client. Bad fits have ranged from an attorney who required way too much handholding to someone who performed well but continually had personal issues that affected the company.

Championship: Kent Denver vs. Colorado Academy, Monday at Don Breese Stadium, 7 p.m.
First-year Principal Brian Burke had pretty much hand-picked them all to be here.

Tsujita Come for lunch, because this new Tokyo-import noodle shop doesn't serve ramen at dinner. And that's what you're here for. There's the tonkotsu (pork-bone broth) ramen with springy noodles and tender, slow-roasted sliced pork. And there's the tsukemen — fatter firm noodles that are served alongside a thick, rich, concentrated pork and bonito broth. Squirt the noodles with a little lime before dipping them into the über-broth for maximum umami.
