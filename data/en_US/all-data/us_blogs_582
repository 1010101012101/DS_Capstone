The “helpful” agent at Blue Cross reminded me that I signed paperwork before surgery making myself financially obligated should there be any payment problem. She asked me if I remembered that. “Um, yeah,” I said. This wasn’t going the way I’d hoped. So I explained my situation—that I’d double-checked everything. She put me on hold so she could read a copy of the letter that had been sent to me. I waited a long time.
but I will still tell you one thing
As I traveled the last leg of my drive, I agonized over stopping at the $9.99 dealer, Ariemma's Garden Center. Here was the dilemma: Should I forgo the flowers, relying on the magnitude of the gift I had already purchased? Or should I buy flowers and cover my bases? However, there was risk buying these flowers. What if she discerns that they are CHEAP, and worse, that she recognizes or deduces that they were purchased at the last minute near her home as an afterthought? It could appear desperate, thoughtless and cheap, as well as undermine everything I had done.

Tyrrell were keen to hold onto him, especially with Honda engines coming onboard. However Williams signed a contract with him although Alesi’s preferred destination was with Ferrari. Nigel Mansell’s decision to leave Ferrari opened the door for Alesi to get his dream move. He would be partnered alongside three-time world champion Alain Prost. Surely it was a match in heaven. However 1991 was a disaster as Ferrari entered a period of being in the doldrums. Alesi retired nine times, often because the car let him down. Third placed finishes in Monaco, Germany and Portugal reminded everyone of his skill but with little reward. Prost was fired before the season’s end after describing the 1991 Ferrari as a ‘truck.’ Williams went onto dominate the 90s so had Alesi gone with his head over his heart, he could well have been a multiple champion.

What I am really trying to get at, is that these books takes all the negative aspects of the Black community to a heighten level, and the new generation of youth readers tries to emulate the characters. Not every story is a happy ending and many of these novels end in tragedy and that in itself is a tragedy to me.

In many ways, the election was a referendum on Sarkozy's presidency as well as his persona, and Sarkozy was deeply unpopular even on the French Right, in spite of his tough talk on France's Muslim immigration problems in an attempt to garner votes from Marian Le Pen's National Front which finished third in the first round of elections.Le Pen pretty much ended any hope of that when she declined to endorse Sarkozy.

Do the words puff pastry make you cringe? It did to me at first when I started scouring all sorts of recipes online for puff pastries…length of time..Holy moly some took upwards to 36 hours to make! That is not my kind of baking/making or cooking. I like short, sweet and for the most part as easy as it can be with the best taste possible. I came across a rough puff pastry dough recipe and decided this is where my brain needs to begin…sure it still took me a few hours to make these beauties from start to finish, but talk about worth every minute, not to mention that cooking and baking relax me.

Today, when standard mandatory retirement ages are a thing of the past, it is more important than ever for employers to understand some of the factors underpinning the retirement decision. For example, the timing of retirement where one of the key myths is that a person’s retirement date will depend largely on when their partner decides to retire, particularly in the case of women.

Despite the stepping down of Mubarak as Egypt’s ruler, the Egyptian revolution has still not accomplished weeding out the political corruption and putting civilians in power. The Muslim Brotherhood and SCAF remain in control of the government, refusing to allocate power to civilian authority. Come June, there have been promises that the government will be turned over, creating a more democratic structure. However, while many are optimistic for this future, SCAF and the Muslim Brotherhood have retained power despite past promises to step down. The revolution itself has impacted relations with other countries who have provided aid to Egypt and who hope to provide aid in the future in order to maintain some influence over its political development. Particularly, the United States has been a large contributor to the Egyptian government, including the Mubarak regime. The Egyptian revolution, though it has succeeded in removing Mubarak from power, has impacted the local, regional, and global levels in numerous ways, including a rise in crime, residual and new political corruption, and international relations.
It's easy for me to say this in hindsight, but I can still remember my 14-year old self, writing gamely on in the middle of the night, blissfully unaware of how long the journey to publication would be. When I finished that first novel in high school, I honestly thought it would be the one that would make it--even though every agent on the planet rejected my query letter. The problem? My premise was flawed. (To give you perspective, here's what it was about: a shy farm boy in a fantasy land gets a visit one day from a mysterious sorceress, who tells him he is the Chosen One. She then takes him on a quest along with a group of companions to help him find out who he is and how he can fulfill his prophecy to save his world. Um....sound familiar?)

Paula Deen worked her way up from nothing, overcoming crippling agoraphobia to create an incredibly successful restaurant business. One would think that Bourdain, and others like him who like to bash Deen would give her credit. If she's such a terrible cook, then she probably wouldn't have had much success with her restaurant, would she? Bourdain once said the definition of a chef is someone who has cooked as the head of a professional kitchen. By Bourdain's own definition Paula Deen is chef. Imagine that.

The author's descriptions of the seasons are wonderful and mixed with many literary references. Sometimes these felt a bit stretched to me. Occasionally the author tried a little too hard, for instance in the chapter on corn which kept making references to corn p*rn. Didn't quite work for me. And she sometimes gets a little too effusive about the glories of farming. Like Kingsolver, I got the impression that farming is practically a religion to Brockman. There were a couple of jabs at more mainline religions, here and there, but not nearly as heavy handed as Kingsolver's. And since I am not a farmer, some of the details in how they weed or harvest got a little too technical for me. I don't even know what burdock is but harvesting it requires a complicated, sychronized digging of ditches which again made my back ache just reading about it.
There are, however, real downsides to a second (unnecessary) job. First, it allows us to defer hard decisions. Should I really be going to two concerts and one play this month? Am I hitting the end of the month over-budget? Can we really afford an out-of-state vacation? Does it make sense to put Johnny into a club sport when we are just barely getting by? When you have a second job, it’s so easy to tell yourself, “Well, I guess a few more hours can’t hurt.” Instead of saying no to compelling but unsustainable ideas, we hedge our way around them by bringing in more money.

We were defeated and reluctantly unplugged our dream from life support and make the choice to rent the gray tuxes. So last weekend we went to Jos. A. Banks to register for the tuxes. I chose them instead of David’s Bridal because they had gray/silver vests that were not as metallic and shiny as DB’s were. So we sat and gave all our wedding info and the names of the groomsmen and when it came time for the vests I asked because I just had to, “You don’t happen to have the vests that matched the tux do you? I just really hate colored vests and the shiny ones so I want the vest to match as closely as possible.” The guy sat back in the chair and was like “Have you guys ever thought about buying a suit instead of renting?” Patrick and I both looked at each other and said in unison “Yes.” It was a very defeated yes lol. So I than explain to the nice gentleman our ordeal and how it just didn’t work out and would cost to much. So as much as we would love to we could not ask that of our groomsmen. The salesman looks at us and says “Listen I’m the Assistant Manager and we offer discounts all the time for bridal parties on suits, let me just show you some 3-piece suits and see what I can do.” So Patrick and I agree thinking what the hell why not.

Famous words of the credit risk, Chantel Rae.
To start with, I absolutely loved and adored Emerson. Here are just a couple of brief reasons why. She has a rock awesome name. She's short. Girlfriend has got some serious spunk. As a fellow short person in arms, I'm always delighted to see a strong, feisty heroine with a less than average height. Em has also been through a lot and one of the things that I loved about her was that she didn't simply tough it out and persevere. No, she fell apart first, lost it, and had a long road of pain and healing to get through before she could even begin to feel whole again. After all, isn't that how this stuff is supposed to work? For this, Emerson felt so real and her emotions raw and tangible, a character anyone who's suffered loss, or even a brush with crazy, could relate too. Don't get me wrong, she had her flaws too, such as being stubborn and impulsive, but she was all the better for it. Now for the guys. *waggles eyebrows* First is Michael and he and Em share not only an instant connection, but an ability as well. I liked Michael pretty well, he was usually sweet, sometimes funny, and, let's not forget, had dashing good looks. However he occasionally felt a little...lacking to me and he annoyed me some when it came to how he was with Emerson. Then we have Kaleb. Can you say YUM? His connection with Emerson felt more grounded in something substantial, the loss and pain that they've experienced. That and Kaleb has personality and charm in spades, not to mention I felt he was more adequately layered with a perfect balance of flaws and attributes. When he first truly took on his role in the story I was like, "Forget Michael." Hourglass also boasted some wonderful supporting characters. Two of my favorites were Em's supportive and caring brother and sister-in-law, Thomas and Dru. Then there were others like Cat, Lily, Ava, and Jack.

4/14/12: Josh Brolin/Gotye: You all may have forgotten that Josh Brolin has already hosted once before. What with Sarah Palin and Mark Wahlberg stopping by, as well Brolin’s W director Oliver Stone commandeering his monologue, as well as musical guest Adele having her first big break, there wasn’t much memorable from that episode that actually featured the host (except for that “I’m No Angel” sketch with a very pregnant Amy Poehler that keeps inexplicably being included in SNL clip shows). Brolin seems like a nice guy, and he’s a fine actor, but, in my estimation, he doesn’t quite have the the temperament for sketch comedy. Hopefully, the writing will be solid.

Speaking of nightmares, I've had two consecutive dreams about zombies a few weeks ago. Both times I woke up disoriented and drenched in sweat. Now I'm not one who easily gets scared--in fact, I love to read horror books. I don't watch a lot of zombie movies, however, because (1) I don't watch a lot of TV/movies to begin with; and (2) I don't watch something that my kids can't watch (this is why books are great!) Anyway, I was surprised about the zombie dreams. Though come to think of it, prior to the nightmares, I dreamed about vampires. Not the sparkly kind. Just your ole regular blood-sucking pain-in-the-ass monsters.
As I hear these children’s stories, it breaks my heart and makes me want to hold them just that much tighter. Their childhood is so much different from my own, but they want what every child wants: someone to love and care for them.

Yes, you read that correctly. NINETEEN. An entire lot of them - with arms - on eBay with a starting bid of £30. W actually encouraged me to go for it, buy them, fix them up and sell them.

And I wouldn't have been opposed to a couple others for the bedrooms.

On the ride home, I asked the children if they remembered hitting the door by accident. While they said no, I reminded them to be very careful when getting out of the car. Even if they had hit the car, by that point, they probably would have been afraid to admit it. I tried to explain that the man was acting crazy because he was upset. When we are upset, we do not act reasonable. If you want something, you have to talk in a reasonable manner. My younger son brought up the incident throughout the rest of the day; as we were reading together at night, he said once more, “You shouldn’t yell, right daddy? You shouldn’t act crazy.” “Yes, that’s right,” I assured him. “We get angry but yelling does not accomplish anything.” Ironically, yelling makes the words louder but not more clear.

That all societies need laws is unquestionable. These are the rules that govern behaviour between its members. Religion is a driving force codifying laws. The state is another; precedent a third. Laws are a key societal infrastructure. Without them the smooth running of society breaks down, enormous friction is generated and economies malfunction and social order breaks down. These events are hugely harmful to individuals and groups. The strongest and fittest survive and gain. The only law that rules is that of the jungle.
I am not a particularly interesting person and I started this blog really to have am outlet of opinion because I have a lot to say about Many topics, though I am only practically almost 13!!!! one of my friends suggested I write about my schools up and coming prom for our year. This may not sound like a big event to you but seriously it is the battle of fake eyelashes and dresses ! I mean it is all about who is the top of the social ladder and who can get a date and just trivial matters like that. But everyone (including me) takes prom deadly seriously, and now I think about it I don’t know why. It has now hit me that it for the girls anyway is a chance to blow out in an expensive dress and to wear heels that will probably affect your feet for life! It is also all about telling people that the non alcoholic punch really is and leads everyone yo drink it in excess and wonder what has happened when they don’t get hammered (drunk)

As for the cartoonishly nasty tone, mean for mean's sake is never enough in a story. Something has to back it up. In SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, when J.J. Hunsecker makes an insult, he has the force of his career to back it up: be glad it's just words, because in fact he could have you killed. Sidney Falco is a self-loathing weasel, and his insults carry that awareness: yeah, I'm a louse, but I know what I am, and you're a hypocrite for not recognizing your own sleaziness. Whereas the manner in which the protagonists of CHICAGO are written and performed gives them nothing else to offer but their vices. They have one note -- vanity -- and it wears out very quickly, there's no other dimension to them. The would-be funny banter between the girls in prison is just a pot and a kettle arguing over blackness: it may as well be Pee-wee and Francis yelling "I KNOW YOU ARE BUT WHAT AM I?" ad nauseam. If you had to share a cell with any of these fucks, either you would have hung yourself or you would have stuck a shiv in them before they could start that first song.
I grew up in a home where I felt constantly downed by various female figures in my life.

Hello Fellow Thrifters and Friends,
Love U Mom!!
The streams were all flooded and ferries and bridges were seldom seen and I would rather take my chance for swim than pass over the rocking and fearful erection they call a bridge which under that name span many of the deep rivers on the road nearer the coast, and however rotten, are seldom repaired till some fatal accident renders the repair imperative. Yet the coolness with which the coachman, after halting for a moment on the edge of the steep broken declivity, and craning forward to look at the stream in advance, broad, muddy, and rapid, running like a mill-race, will then plunge into it with his horses, descending down till the water covers their backs, is admirable. On these occasions we always thought that a preparation to swim was no sign of cowardice, and made our precautions accordingly. From all this you may gather that travelling in the South is still in its infancy, and I may add shamefully expensive. You pay exorbitantly for the meanest fare.

At the station, Vega tells Britten he has a lead on a case. However, when they go to meet Vega's lead, the supposed pawn shop is a vacant storefront. When Vega admits the lead offered to help him for $100, Britten tells him he's been scammed. "If you have to buy it, it may be information. If they try and sell it to you, it's always BS." Britten adds, "Think of it as a rookie tax." But Britten notices an odd bit of graffiti on the vacant storefront: a red exclamation mark over an asterisk.
Ever heard the expression,"jack of all trades, master of none?" its seems like a good idea to be a "jack" initially, I admit. After all, if you know a little bit about a variety of subjects, then you will be versatile enough to do whatever a client calls for! What's wrong with that?? Well, while you WILL get a couple of assignments, you may not feel entirely comfortable doing that particular thing. For instance, I can DO background drawing, but it's a labor intensive activity for me, as opposed to cartooning and caricature which I can do in my sleep. When a client hires you to do a job, they're not expecting a generalist, they're expecting a master, who not only knows their subject inside out, but can even re invent and re adjust on the fly. When you are teaching, you don't want there to be any guesswork. You also want to have fun! Strive to teach on the subject that you KNOW. Doing so will help you develop your own niche, and it's this Niche which will focus you and make you stand out from the pack.

What is truth? I ask that question often. Do you know? Neurological researchers tell us that our little buddy the hypocampus decides for each individual what is real, what is true, subsequently creating what they call the "best possible story" for the conscious function. This best possible story is based on sensory data, but also on memory, and according to each individual's values. There is no one objective truth.

Now, my dad DID do the things that he loved, but he did them on the side. He built half of our house himself and I mean really re-built half of our house in a way that no one in their right mind would do. For example, he extended the BASEMENT. Yep, my dad extended the basement with a wheelbarrow and a shovel and as I remember, by reading Time-Life books. He also made this replica of a Picasso stained glass window that lives in my parents’ living room. And the liquor cabinet – oh – the liquor cabinet — he hand carved a Germanic, Winter-Summer theme right on to its doors. I remember my dad sitting up in bed at night hand carving that thing with an X-Acto knife. (How my mother didn’t kill him for getting shavings all over the bed, I’ll never know.) Then there’s our dining room table – made by my father, the china cabinet – made by my father, the buffet table – made by my father, the entertainment set in the den – made by my father, the end tables in the den – made by my father. Back when I shared an apartment in Manhattan, I had the coolest loft bed you can imagine – of course – made by my father with a mini-desk and shelving units built-in underneath.

In movies I found art, I also found room for criticism. The way it was directed, the selected cast, the beauty in every scene. That is why I prefer to watch movies made with quality, not made specifically to target the mainstream culture in order to make a profit. I have a natural habit of analyzing a movie as I am watching it, like I’m programmed to dissect ever bit of the movie in order to understand its concept. But, watching movies is not always about just analyzing. It takes me away from my surroundings for an hour or two. It is something I found as another medium.
Creating a detailed outline requires an immense amount of patience because you as an author need to sit in front of your computer for hours on end, crafting an intricate plot, complex, strong characters and their traits. This is very tedious work, but if mastered, it will serve your novel well. However, it is very difficult to master this technique and it must be done perfectly. A detailed outline is extremely restricting so even a trivial mistake can damage the entire novel. These errors can be nearly imperceptible at the time the outline is being created but after writing three-fourths of the novel, they will be conspicuous and a wave of profanities will likely escape you upon discovering the small inconsistency that could potentially ruin the book. These mistakes are most commonly discrepancies in the characters’ personalities and their corresponding actions. For example, George is a fearful character who is terrified of weapons but at the end of the novel he is supposed to kill all the antagonists and save the day (hopefully, this isn’t your plot because it has been done and redone WAY too many times). I understand that characters often change throughout novels, but this is very radical transformation and unless George is slowly accustomed to fighting beforehand, to a skeptical reader this is simply implausible. And guess what happens to your novel next? Bye, bye. Of course, you could just alter the plot slightly so that George doesn’t need to save the day, but altering the plot poses a number of other issues. What will happen to George? Who will take his place for saving the day? I’m certain that in a book like this, all of the protagonists except for George will be captives of the antagonists, so how do you go from there? Simple; you don’t.

There has been a long period of silence in my life. I’ve felt unmotivated to read, write, or speak. A communication breakdown that followed a period of dark humbling in my life after a period of brilliance and accomplishment. I will blame nothing except my own learning curve for this silence. That way, I alone am able to explain it. I maintain the rights to my own artistic adventures. I maintain the rights to my own tragedies. Ideas are just as important as privacy, if not moreso. At least, that’s my opinion on the matter.

Theodore Dalrymple: Political correctness is communist propaganda writ small. In my study of communist societies, I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to persuade or convince, nor to inform, but to humiliate; and therefore, the less it corresponded to reality the better. When people are forced to remain silent when they are being told the most obvious lies, or even worse when they are forced to repeat the lies themselves, they lose once and for all their sense of probity. To assent to obvious lies is to co-operate with evil, and in some small way to become evil oneself. One’s standing to resist anything is thus eroded, and even destroyed. A society of emasculated liars is easy to control. I think if you examine political correctness, it has the same effect and is intended to.

After you see a doctor, sometimes insurance companies take more than 30-60 days to process your claim and inform the clinic of the exact amount they will pay. The clinic however will start billing you as soon as they can process the paperwork. When this happens, sometimes the bill the clinic sends you is actually more than you will owe once the insurance pays their part.

What I suspect Mr Auster dislikes most is that his calling me an anti-semite is not enough to shut me up. My response is: I know what I am, the question is what are you?
But then just an hour later I got a call from my dad. He said "Now, I don't want you to worry." So immediately I worried. My mom was brought to the hospital yesterday afternoon by a colleague. She was having trouble standing up straight, and then had trouble breathing. They did an MRI and an EKG and there was nothing that they could find. She, like me, gets migraines, and they think that what happened was linked to what causes her migraines. The feeling she had, loss of control, caused her to have a panic attack they think, which caused the inability to breathe. She is home and is fine, but it was a scary call to receive. I am so thankful that she works with people who really care about her and were there when she needed them. And this incident put life into perspective for me and my feelings of disappointment earlier in the day seemes insignificant and unimportant. I am just so happy my mom is OK. She had planned to come to Wine & Design, and we moved here to be closer to my parents. My mom is my best friend... we talk or email almost every day. And that quick flash of a moment where the "What if?" was hanging over my head scared me. I can't imagine not being able to email her or call her when I want to, or just drop by her office with the kids for a surprise visit.
I've read a few blog posts recently about fat acceptance/healthy at every size (HAES) and I'd like to blog about it from the other side. Most of those bloggers write about being criticised for not being thin. I've lost a lot of weight since my second daughter was born. I now weigh less than I did when I was 15 and I have lost count of the amount of comments I've received about how "fantastic" I look and how "awesome" it is that I've lost so much weight. It's not fantastic, this wasn't' deliberate weight loss and it is definitely not a sign that I'm healthy. The last time I weighed this much I had not finished growing!

Lately, I’ve really been trying to keep in mind the enlightening statement of Servant of God, Dorothy Day: “You only love God as much as you love the person you love the least.” It’s a good reminder when I get angry, as I so often do, at women who dismiss and publicly disdain my faith, even as they claim to be members of the same faith.
Causing back pain, suffocation,
This is one of the reason people are willing to rip others off just to get what they want. They compromise their values, sacrifice their integrity and sell their sous for stuff, failing to realize that God is able to make you abound with every good thing and you don’t have to lie, sleep with the boss, or rip someone off to get it!

Three older women friends from church, congratulating us both, said they all knew it was me — and it was — who had been the reluctant one, not Jose, which most people (sexists!) assumed it must be. My first marriage, which lasted barely two years after five together beforehand, did mean leaving behind my career, family and friends in Canada to start again, at 30, in New York in a recession. It was terribly hard and lonely.

One of my favorite examples of Thomas’s use of the “fossil out-of-place” argument is from an article entitled “Fossil Footprints Trample Evolutions Timeline.” – It talks about arthropod trace-fossil foot prints which were found in Pre-Cambrian strata in Nevada. Thomas presented this find as if it were a blow to the Evolutionary theory because it would require some reevaluation of determining when arthropods appeared. It never occurred to them that this find actually hurts Creationism more than it could ever hurt the present theory of Evolution. More precisely, this discovery hurts the favorite Creationist argument about the so-called Cambrian”explosion” because it shows that complex, animal life was around 30 million years before.

As for ‘How deep is your love’ – I feel the only reason a guy wants to know is to either boost his ego or for the purpose of running – we all know that guys run once they smell commitment.

We first hear of the Nazirite vow in the sixth chapter of Numbers. A person — male or female — freely takes a vow to Lord wherein they will not only refrain from wine but from grapes, grape seed, raisins — anything associated with the vine. The Nazirite will allow the hair of his head to grow uncut, unthinned until the vow is complete. Oddly, the Nazirite is not allowed to touch a corpse — odd, for Samson, anyway, since he is going to be creating a lot of corpses. Though Samson is a Nazirite called by God from his birth, those who take the Nazirite vow do so for a limited period of time. When the time ends, the person goes to the priest with a specific set of offerings — two lambs, a ram, unleavened bread, and a drink offering: And the Nazirite shall shave his consecrated head at the entrance of the tent of meeting and shall take the hair from his consecrated head and put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offering (Numbers 6:18). Thus the vow and the period of special dedication ends.

And then they move out into the world on their own, and whatever small semblance of control or influence we thought we had dissipates to nothing, almost overnight. Where they will live, who they will marry, what kind of people they will be, are all their choice. Of course, at that young adult stage we recognize that this behavior, this freedom of self-determination, is normal and necessary. And we trust that we have sent them into the world with the tools they need; after all, this is why we attempted to control so much in the first place. And maybe we have, through our efforts, been able to influence them to the point where they will make good decisions.

Whether or not the stereotypical act that Ming (a.k.a Jose) cooked up was meant as a subversive commentary on the prevailing attitudes of the times, or if he was just simply “giving the people what they want” will have to remain an open question. Both partners in the team have been dead for decades. All we have now are some facts. The team toured the world, enjoying particular success in Australia, where vaudeville didn’t die for many years after American vaudeville had passed. They toured in various editions of George White’s Scandals and the Ziegfeld Follies. Later, Toy (whose real name was Margie) changed her name to Hoo Shee, and her brother joined the act. They became “Ming, Ling and Hoo Shee, Three Hillbillies from the Burma Road.” Ming played accordion and ukulele and also juggled; Ling played guitar (and apparently sang like one of the guys from the Ink Spots); Hoo Shee sang and danced (some called her the Chinese Betty Hutton).

Vyrso. Also published by Logos, this app is virtually the same program as Logos, but does not have the original language features. You can still read your Logos books, but links to lexicons are not included. Vyrso is designed to read books sold through the Vyrso store, which is not quite online yet. When it is fully launched, the site will focus on Christian literature. Vyrso is more or less the Christian Bookstore of the Internet. With the number of books Logos already has, the Vyrso store will open with a major library of books, many of which are not available in Kindle or iBooks. I have already reviewed Vyrso and pointed out that the App is not designed to work with biblical languages. You may read a Greek Bible, but there are no resources for looking up lexical forms or doing any kind of morphological search. (This review applies to version 1.01).

I am proud of the fact that I found my mother’s father whom she had never known. I found an immigration paper that had a picture of my grandfather and when I was sure it was him I showed it to my mother. It was the first time in her 65 years of life, that she could remember, that she laid eyes on her father’s face. It was a wonderful moment to witness. My grandmother has passed away, but she would never discuss the past or give my mother any information about my mother’s father or even her own parents.

"When a group of French women collect in a London barracks during World War II, their khaki uniforms cannot conceal their sexual desire - often for each other. Touchingly written from the point of view of one of the younger and more innocent 'girl soldiers,' Women's Barracks reflects Tereska Torres' experiences in the Free French forces assembled under General Charles de Gaulle. Condemned in 1952 for its 'artful appeal to sensuality, immorality, filth, perversion and degeneracy' by the House Select Committee on Current Pornographic Materials, Torres' novel was an underground phenomenon, selling four million copies in the United States and many more abroad. The first 'lesbian pulp,' it remains relevant and intensely readable today."

Lately, I’ve noticed more frequently that every time I look at the gas gauge in my car, it is always running on empty. Whether it’s $20.00 or $10.00, it just disappears so fast. OK, the price is gas has a lot to do with it. It’s getting to the point that if the empty gas light isn’t on, then something is wrong. I’m deranged, I know.

How does SodaStream work? It’s simple! You fill up the plastic bottle with tap water up to the FILL LINE. Then you thread the bottle onto the machine and press until you hear it buzz. By pressing the button, you are carbonating the water. This was my daughter Rose's favorite part! The average fizz takes 3 buzzes. Unthread the bottle and add your favorite tasting syrup. Our first flavor we tried was the lemon-lime flavor (aka Sprite).

‘I spoke to the two lads from the room next door. No, I spoke to the one lad. His husband’s sleeping as well. We had a good chat in the canteen and he’s very positive. Said they’d only been married for a month when they had the accident. Isn’t that sad? One month. Barely enough time to get sick of each other.’ I chuckled on your behalf. ‘I told him it’ll be our ten years next week and I swear I thought he was gonna start crying. Soft sod, I told him, I said, don’t be soft, she’ll be awake by then and if she’s not we’ll celebrate when she wakes up.’ I reached over and grabbed your slender hand and gave it a light squeeze. ‘He smiled at that and said he couldn’t wait till him and his hubby were having their ten years.’ I chuckled again. ‘Growing up I’d have never thought I would be sat in a hospital canteen chatting to a man who was married to another man. What a world we live in. And you still hear people on the news saying it’s not right and I say, whatever, if people love each other what business is it of anyone else’s? I told him a joke that Charles had told me the other day.

Anyway, the song is a great showcase for some backing vocal harmonies, organ, and Dave's guitar.

If worship is to be truly biblical, faithful to the tradition of the Bible and rooted in history to Christ’s church, and engaging His church in the world today, then it must be, what one author calls, “a royal ‘waste’ of time,”[1] where God is both the subject and the object of our worship, where we spend ourselves in the splendor of our great creator and covenant keeping King, and where we delight our selves in, and subject our emotions to, the full-hearted devotion to His Son that His Spirit enables.

So I have my reasons for doing shows, and eventually, I will retire from them completely once I’ve had my fill and move on to something else that will satisfy my competitive edge. But, I find that some people aren’t really sure why they want to go through the strenuous preparation it takes to get ready for the stage. They often put so much into planning for show-day that they overlook the importance of preparing for after the show; they walk away unfulfilled, disappointed and broke. I tend to compare a first-time competitor to a new bride. Have you ever heard of post-wedding blues? There’s also what is fondly referred to as “post-competition blues” and both men and women competitors can experience it. With months of preparation, a lot of money spent, training and eating a specific way everyday and dozens of other details to attend to, a competitor thinks of little else when getting ready for a show. The most important part of your competition plan should be what you do AFTER the show, but hardly anyone plans for it.

Brian O’Halloran and Jeff Anderson team up as Dante and Randal, two conveniecne store clerks who couldn’t be more of an odd couple. Dante is the pessimist witha very attractive girlfriend, pining for his ex-girlfriend from high school and whining about not having to be there. Randal just doesn’t care about the customers, but rather spending time with his best friend Dante…some have argued that there is some sort of homosexual undertone there. The different philosophies of the two characters really makes the film go.

I actually stopped listening to the audiobook and read the last third of this book because I wanted to get through it faster. This is a sort of alternate dimension, going into the past story, but I quite liked it because it offered some background on all of the older characters. In particular, it was nice to see the Patrician as a student. I love the patrician. If you like the other books about the watch, then you’ll probably like this one, I did.

According to those attempting to “fundamentally change the way we think about tobacco”, the slippery slope argument has more recently begun to be ridiculed as alarmist justification for preventing any progress toward achieving the mythical and perpetually elusive “level playing field.” Like the Nazi comparison between Anti-Smoker Advocates and their virtual SS counterparts, it’s difficult to prove, but not at all difficult to examine the similarities between the progression of one to the other extreme.

Fifteen-year-old Cyan was named after the colour blue by her artist mother. And blue, in all its shades, is how it feels for Cyan to be back in the Caribbean one year after the loss of her father, drowned in an inexplicable sailing accident. Expected to play host to a potential new stepsister, Cyan’s past and future feel coloured by mystery. Did her mother drive her father away? If he killed himself why didn’t he leave Cyan a note to help her understand? And most bafflingly, why did he sail to the horizon with an ice bucket and two champagne glasses on board?

May seem like a low standard, but it has proven to be, funny enough, successful. I have always looked at my friends for help in pushing me though those tough times, and they have, and because they have helped me, because they have always been there for me, because they have never given up on me I am successful. It is the same way with all we do in our lives, work and at home. Success is measured by society, superiors, family and friends, but we must measure ourselves. We must not let others measure how we succeed or fail. We must hold our own standards. By letting others not enter in to our measure of success we are providing an example of honest and passionate working success, and blueprints for further generations to succeed after us. Because in judging others we lose ourselves. Others do not know our hardwork, our long hours, or our thoughts. We know our work, time spent, and thoughts, therefore we must look at ourselves in the mirror and ask, “Am I successful?”

This, I think, was largely a byproduct of the depiction of the dynamics between the two sisters in general. For one thing Mina’s voice was just far more immediate and convincing than Suna’s, hence already one side of the relationship looks weaker in comparison. Suna’s chapters weren’t convincing in the slightest. The third person present tense had this dreamy quality that, while on rare occasions managed a lyricism that drew me (The part wherein Suna wore the dress? Beautiful, and probably the only truly empowering scene Suna had in the whole novel.), most of the times made Suna to seem like an infantile preteen stuck in her own head. She sounded simply way too young and naïve, and I find this childlike depiction of Suna and the connection between her disability leading to her mother’s rejection and her sister’s fierce protection disingenuous and terribly problematic. Also this dreamlike quality made her interactions with her mother and her sister never quite believable to the reader, which definitely hindered the reading experience. It is too bad that An Na was not quite able to depict a believable sisterly relationship between Mina and Suna, because so much of this book rests on the results of their sisterly bond, but none of the story’s climax and ultimate conclusion had the desirable effect it needed to pack its strongest punch. The caricature of the mother and almost non-existent father did nothing to help matters.

As the housing also acts the suspension rocker, there are also elements machined into its outer face to accommodate this function. Firstly the housing acts as the rocker linkage, so a rocker arm is part of the machined shape. One of these eyes in the rocker will mount the heave damper and the other eye has bearing to accept the pushrod. Showing the packaging efficiency of the Rotary damper a further spherical bearing is fitted to a machined section of the cover plate. This accepts the Anti Roll Bar linkage. Thus for the Midland, no further suspension elements need to be fitted to anything but the damper housing. In the case of the all F1 Rotary dampers, the damper body rotates and the damper rod is fixed to the gearbox (via splines). As one part moves and the remains static, the vane moves through the oil filled cavity, the reaction force of these two parts creates the damping effect. To allow the damper body to rotate in the gearbox, two bearing surfaces are machined into the outer face of the housing and cover plate.

In this case one of the results were some restrictive fire arms laws. For instance it is absolutely forbidden to use a gun to warn people off. If you have a license of a gun you must keep is covered at all time and out of sight of the public. If you break the law you could wind up spending 7 years behind bars. Now the guy is claiming that the gun was a fake and everyone - not surprisingly - is agreeing with him. Though the only thing you can tell from the pictures is that the gun appears to be a semi automatic & pointed at a photographer, even the paparazzo is swearing up and down that it was a toy. If the gun is a fake they could still send the guy away for 2.

paints the landscape of his childhood on a council estate in Coventry using Humbrol enamel... The highly detailed paintings are of houses, pubs and nearby parks, without people but filled with evidence of human activities.The exhibition quoted Larkin: "Nothing, like something, happens anywhere". One might equally have invoked Samuel Beckett. Shaw has a penchant for the great title. My favourite picture (and title) of his here was Landscape with Dog Shit Bin. To my mind, this was an artist doing what Grayson Perry wants artists to do. There were overtones of Perry, too, in the preoccupation with the artist's childhood - with regard not only to subject-matter but also to the choice of materials (the Humbrol paint, as the blurb says, "the material of choice for teenage model makers" ). Definitely worth queuing round the block for.

Somehow, during that time, (the 1950’s to 1960’s) there was less of everything: teen pregnancies, teen dropouts, and teen deaths.

that tends to grow peach fuzz instead of hair all over my body, I paid absolutely no attention to the despair other women were going through over this somewhat unfeminine scourge of theirs. My sisters and my mom are all brunettes, and they seemed to speak this unknown language of eyebrow picking and mustache removal wax that secretly, I was happy to skip. I had watched my mom pluck her eyebrows hundreds of times over years of my childhood, and the whole process kind of grossed me out. I hate pain in general. So, before I will embark on something painful, no matter how great it is going to make me look, I weigh all the pros and cons. And having perfectly shaped eyebrows just weren’t worth the plucking pain you had to stand to get them. Plus, frankly you can’t really see mine that well. They’re even lighter than my hair…win!

In terms of natural endowment, Africa ought to be the richest of the continents but see the mess we have made of the potential for greatness which God in his infinite wisdom has bestowed upon us. We have proved totally incapable of harnessing the abundant natural resources to become great. Today, there is a renewed scramble for the wealth of Africa. China, our new "friend", does not bother about the genocide against fellow blacks in the Sudan by the Arabs who control the affairs of that country. They say they do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of any country. All they want is the oil in Sudan to run their industries. Yet, we blacks have not seen the Chinese action as an affront to our sensitivities. Every race takes us for granted because we are so weak and so foolish, if you permit me to say it.
And it would give me plenty to blog about.

TD: To understand how you will act tomorrow, it’s good to have a look over your shoulder to see where you’re coming from. What made you decide to start a business? Why is it that you think you can assume a leadership role? What evidence do you have from past experiences that can predict your success in that role? These are questions you could ask yourself before starting a business. Being an entrepreneur is completely different from being an employee, even as an executive in a CEO role.
I say, without going into the extremes (a man purse, man heels, make-up, and stylish wigs) metrosexuality is all right with me. Although I don’t particularly look for a metrosexual man (thus my extremely nonmetrosexual boyfriend) If done with moderation, its actually kind of cool.

That leads me to believe one of two possibilities. Either it was Sheridan’s intention all along to sack counsel and defend himself, on the basis that his oratory would sway the jury (as had already happened in Edinburgh) and that he would be seen as the “common man” standing up to the massive NotW or his QC was not prepared to pursue one or more of the lines of defence Sheridan had suggested. Counsel have a duty to their client of course, but also a duty to the court, and in a legally aided case, to the Scottish Legal Aid Board. If they feel they are being called upon to act in breach of their duties, and the client insists, then they must withdraw. If Mr McBride had been acting for Sheridan, rather than for Gail, then it may very well be the case that the same decisions, whether that of Sheridan to dispense with counsel, or by counsel to withdraw, would have been taken.
By wolf I mean, perhaps, the best example of wolf that anime keeps on using: the fable of the Little Red Riding Hood. This is the human wolf–a wolf pretending to be a person in order to achieve the wolf’s wolf-y goals. Which is usually about being a wolf’s survival, or desire to eat somebody, or some such.

I could find that perfect fit, and that is what I am aiming for.

It bugs me because people really don’t know what being creepy is. I’m a pretty passive guy. I have reason to believe most Facebook users are creepier than I am. Many of my friends can vouch for me when I say that I can’t even show them a picture of one of my friends without getting freaked out. I have always sworn that every time you right click a picture of your favorite female friend, click “Open in new tab,” and give the link to someone else, that the owner of the picture knows you did it. Thus, I want to throw up every time someone asks.
As I promised to share, here is the information about my classroom infrastructure. I call my skills-based method, "Integrated Literacy in the Interactive Classroom," and I have had much satisfaction in teaching this way. Most students buy-in to this method because they have authority and ownership of the class. They know what comes when, when to bring which book, and where to find their assignments when they miss. And, they do all the work, not you.

This afternoon, ventured off to the 38th New York State Field Band High School Championship Show held at Syracuse University's Carrier Dome. It is amazing as to the number of talented teenagers who play music and perform for their high schools. While my local high school (Auburn) did not take first place, they fascinated the audience with their program, "Tales from the Crypt, Revenge of the Vampires" that included the following selections:

“I laughed,” says McGinniss. “The closer I got and the more people I talked to who knew her, the more I laughed.

Analysis: So, Ideally my surprise would have been Michael Floyd, but he’s off the surprise! board already so I’m going with Hill. Everyone has Tannehill pegged to the Dolphins, and honestly I like the move. Matt Moore can and should be the starter and then in a year (or even 2) Tannehill can take over (potentially with Moore moving to a back-up role if there’s nothing better out there for him) BUT the Dolphins traded Brandon Marshall, so WR is a pretty big need, and at 6’5 Hill is a pretty big guy. There are a lot of questions about how much finishing he’ll need, but I’m not worried, he’s big, he’s fast and he’s willing to put in work. The Dolphins shouldn’t mind reaching…and they can still grab Kirk Cousins in the 2nd.
The Manhattan district attorney's office has filed suit against the New York State Independence Party for failing to return hundreds of thousands of dollars allegedly stolen from Mayor Michael Bloomberg as part of a sham Election Day ballot security operation. DA raps Indie Party in $1M Mike-elex theft (NYP) * Suit Suggests Political Party Knew of Fraud A suit by the Manhattan district attorney says the Independence Party may have helped cover up a scheme to steal $1.1 million from Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s latest re-election campaign. (NYT) * Trying Haggerty: “There is ample evidence to believe all of the defendants made attempts to hide the evidence of the crimes and conceal the fact that the funds contributed by the mayor had not been used as originally intended,” the DA’s Office asserted. (New York Post) * Prosecuting Haggerty: “We respectfully tried to give it back to Mayor Bloomberg and they declined to take it,” Mr. MacKay said Thursday. Asked why the party was willing to return the money to the mayor and not the district attorney, Mr. MacKay said, “He gave it to us.” (Wall Street Journal)
Plantinga’s first response to this is to note that he doesn’t exactly choose to believe in God. Although there may be “some sort of regimen” that he could use to eventually change or extinguish that belief, it’s not like if offered a million dollars he could just change his belief in a moment.
The Chicago Latino Film Festival offers film aficionados a comprehensive, inclusive overview at the current state of filmmaking in Latin America, Spain, Portugal and even the United States. It showcases different styles, approaches and languages, embracing both box-office successes in those countries and more daringly experimental work. And regardless of Time Out Chicago’s recent snub (“It’s a bit of crapshoot, as most of the selections are from filmmakers without international reps”), the 28th Chicago Latino Film Festival this year featured the work of such festival circuit darlings as Argentina’s Eliseo Subiela (whose work has been shown in the past at both the Chicago Latino Film Festival AND the Chicago International Film Festival), Mexico’s María Novaro and Spain’s Ventura Pons (the subject this year of a conference at the University of Colorado-Denver and the only filmmaker whose films have been chosen to compete five years in a row at the Berlinale) and Montxo Armendariz alongside the work of first-time filmmakers.
The lowest BF is in Bexley & Bromley, at 1.8. B&B is a pretty solid seat, so that comes as no great surprise, and it could be argued that folk were more inclined to vote for the slate than elsewhere.

And they spend their time wishing, hoping, and dreaming there was another way to raise their children. They may hate their jobs, dislike their children's schools.

The impact twirled my car around, bouncing from one snow bank to the other.

He really didn’t enjoy having Calgar take forever getting into combat and so he wants to put him in a Pod, which I think is a good idea. However, I advised him to take a second “dummy” pod in case his opponent plays Reserve denial or if Ivan goes first in Dawn of War (thus dropping his pricey squad on nothing while his opponent rolls in with everything turn one.) The “dummy” pod can contain something cheap and versatile like a Dreadnought, or even a Tactical Squad if he has the points. This way Ivan can choose what to drop turn one, and not send Calgar and friends into the middle of nowhere. Or, if his opponent does set up, Calgar came come crashing down right away in his face.

Fit for a couples’ skate or a slow dance at a 60’s prom, this track muddles longing and desperation, while managing to lash out at those very same emotions that give it its depth. All of this is made possible by Madeline Follin’s voice, and hearing it live was like waking up in Oz after living in black and white. She’s one of those singers that sounds better live, and whose passion comes across as almost volatile, like if she were to exert herself any harder she might fly apart. But she never lost her poise. Standing on stage swaying her dress slightly, she filled the room with “You Know What I Mean”, a song about the duality of asking for help, and simultaneously feeling weak as a result. Follin manages to bridge that cause and effect by finding common ground in certain aspects of loneliness that we all experience, which is not a sign of weakness, but merely a side effect of being human. Although hearing them live was a near out of body experience, not to mention the lights were trippy as hell. Going back and listening to the studio version of “You Know What I Mean” has made me see the error in my ways; it’s simply a fantastic song. But goddamn, hearing it live is hard to top.

Zack: Well, my favorite album is “Frizzle Fry“, but it never wants to stay with me. I think I've bought that album 6 or 7 fucking times!!!! So I would probably save “Revolver” from The Beatles, stuff “Master of Puppets” into the sleeve, making it a double album!!! Then I would wrap the albums in a blanket, rush them out of the burning building, hurrying to a river where I would place them ever so gently in a basket, floating them away to their safety, where the barbarians couldn't reach them.

As a blogger, your main goal is always to separate the wheat from the chaff. But really, if your readers are a bunch of unfaithful trolls, what good is your blog? A lot of bloggers brag about their reader counts. "Hey, I've got 5324 subscribers. I must be pretty good." Yeah, but you've only got 5 half-decent readers. Meanwhile I have 0 readers and 0 excellent readers. Last time I checked, that's a better percentage.
Per Thomas Homer-Dixon, empires rise and fall based on their control of the dominant energy supply, and the US also faces a shift from oil to renewables.

If I’m feeling just a little blah, but not completely down (this only works for minor blahs) I go on facebook and post leading headlines just to get a chuckle out of the feedback. Here’s the thing, everyone who knows me knows full well that I’m not the ‘boo-hoo pity-party-for-me’ type. You will never see me sign on to facebook and gripe about how I feel sick today (unless I can find away to spin it into a joke), how I’m feeling like the world is out to get me or how I wish the world would just cut me some slack. (Note: You people may not be so blissfully spared from my down days – and yes, I do have them – since this is a place of writing, and writing is supposed to be honest, and honesty is sometimes dark, sad, angry or self-pitying, but please note that if I write a post about the shitty day I’m having, I’m not fishing for sympathy, just saying what’s on my mind) You’ll never see me post pictures of my dinner either – totally off topic, but that drives me bonkers so I thought I’d throw it out there.

ADGA uses a combination of sources including syndicated national and regional readership surveys, unique user and browser data, FT research based on large samples of its reader/user base as well as ABC circulation figures.

Life is dangerous – even if it’s unintentional. No matter the lifestyle, no one escapes Freud’s alleged death wish. Whether it’s a compulsion for that first cup of morning coffee or an obsession with shoe shopping, extreme behavior hits everyone in one way or another.

Perhaps it was evenings in the backyard. Whether it was badminton, or croquet, or eating dinner on the green table, or just sitting and listening to the birds, it was a peace from the world. In the summer, after bike rides and long, hot days, it was to sit in the grass and feel the cool breeze blowing overhead; seeing the golden sky as the sun set only to illuminate another hot tomorrow. The lavender blossomed and set the whole yard full of fragrance, and the bumblebee tree was set abuzz with bees.

Character development, when you have several screenwriters in a room, as well as office execs, as well as actors, as well as an audience that’s steadily shrinking, is hard to pull off. While I rail against the writing, I’m aware of the limitations put upon the writers and think they’re part of the problem. House should have ended awhile ago; there’s no way the writers could have been successful while their options that fit within a formula dwindle.
The video then goes on to provide exact details of the time, place and nature of the protests. The first company set to take the blow is AT&T, whose local offices will be targeted for protest between May 1 and May 5.

As the women left the house at 610 N. Buchanan Blvd tempers became frayed and some sharp words were exchanged and one of the boys, again not one of those who later faced charges, made the mistake of using the infamous “N” word, although, he did not do so until after the second dancer had accused the players of being “Skinny dicked white boys”. Another player made a somewhat obscure comment asking the women to thank their grandparents for his “fine cotton shirt” which the media later determined to be a reference to slavery and therefore condemned the team to lasting allegations of racism.

“Then he threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin embraced him, weeping” (Genesis 45:14). “They all wept as they embraced him and kissed him. What grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again. Then they accompanied him to the ship. After we had torn ourselves away from them, we put out to sea and sailed straight to Cos” (Acts 20:37-21:1). “The brothers there had heard that we were coming, and they traveled as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. At the sight of these men Paul thanked God and was encouraged” (Acts 28:15).

The report also showed that rising food prices and malnutrition are putting future global progress on child mortality at risk. This trend is especially alarming in Asia, where more than a third of children are stunted, which account for almost 100 million of the global total. India holds the highest rate of stunting amongst children at a shocking 48 percent.
I find that my walking is teaching me; each time I go out one more stranger has become friend. I look at the wayside plants through vehicle windows with longing as I zoom by. I've had my nose in a most excellent book of Hedgerow Medicine, which has taught me all sorts of things I didn't know, like that Goji berries grow in England's hedgerows! This year things are flowering early, and in the last few days the plants have been tumbling over each other to bloom. Yesterday I picked a bunch of Ground Ivy, White Bluebells and Yellow Archangel for a friend's birthday. Even the mud in the middle of the road sprouts tiny plants, determined, unnoticed and driven-over. As time goes on, my book will fill with green learnings, as I make my apprenticeship with the hedge.

For myself, I have elemental beings with long pointed ears(a la Zelda) and wings. They're like my own special house blend of Tolkein elf, angel, and random. They've been that way since the conception of the novel, so I'm really dead-set on them looking that way, even though there isn't really a reason. So…I made one up. I wouldn't call it contrived, but the logic is pretty weak, because at the base of it is, "because they look COOL." So, since "that's the way it is" in my head, that's they way I'm keeping it, and to get away with it, I need to make the reader believe "that's the way it is," too.

If I happen to be in a department store when I’m feeling down (or if I’m feeling blue enough I’ll just go to one), there is an almost sure-fire way to get me in a good mood; even if it pisses off nearly everyone else around (Oops). I love – like, LOVE it – going down the toy aisles and pressing every button, pulling every string and/or flipping every switch on every single talking, laughing, dancing, burping, crying (you get the picture) toy in sight. This is doubly awesome at Christmas time in the seasonal section because a billion and one cutesy-cartoonish characters shaking their rears while singing a cacophony of carols is about the funniest thing in the world (to me). I’ll go from one end of an aisle to the other trying to get all the toys going in unison – this is much harder to do than it might sound – and before long, I’m usually laughing like a fool.
I've been away for awhile. I have been so ambivalent of time as of late that I didn't even realize months had gone by since I last posted. Months . . . lifetimes, really.
And Christmas snuck out early on Saturday. This tool bench had been riding around in my car for weeks from a snag at a yard sale.

But there are some things that I really do like: super-fresh produce, awesome thrift stores, and most of all the fact that I never feel in a rush to go anywhere. Living in New York City, there were so many people around all the time that I always felt in a hurry and my day-to-day stress level was high enough to feel like I was having a panic attack sometimes.

When I was in high school, I had it in my head that I wanted a yellow mountain bike. I was watching Seinfeld episodes at the time, and Jerry had a mint green bike hanging up on a back wall of his apartment. And I thought, I want a happy-colored bike. Why did I want a mountain bike? No idea. Why yellow? Anyone's guess. But I wouldn't let it go, until a yellow mountain bike, which my parents searched the ends of the earth for, appeared in my living room one Christmas Eve. I eyed it longingly for several more months until the black ice cleared and I could actually ride it.

Finally, here is Cyndi Reeves, an expert on the novella form and a professor at Rosemont College. She invited some of us to celebrate the author and professor Michael Martone, and that was where I was Tuesday evening, after hugging my students goodbye.

Finally at 26 years, she decided to commit to dance and joined the hippodrome in Birmingham. With exposure to Dance Xchange and other dance groups and people she has built a healthy support system and network for herself.

Ideally, I would like to see the region’s local research societies get together and take an active part in administering the system. They would be responsible for the publicity, for facilitating access, and helping to tailor the course to their market. One issue with the Georgia University course, from my experience, is that it is by nature somewhat US-orientated. They also could help in the translation into local languages, ideally by co-opting a couple of the senior industry figures from their market, many of whom would be semi-retired, but would have enjoyed thorough research training. There are plenty of ex-SRG, ex-Frank Small, and the like directors around who could ably handle the task. And translation is important; from my experience in Japan, exam grades were at times more correlated to English ability than inherent research skill.

Okay, so avoiding the grammar snark, which is very hard to do (but it would take me an extra thousand words just to get through the first sentence, let alone the paragraph), lets get to the meat of the matter (okay, couldn’t resist one small one). Not only does the paragraph make no sense, it completely minimalizes the stress and emotion a teenager is going through at the time this situation might occur. She has no facts or statistics to back up her oddly chosen reasons of marriage for a young military couple, and she again generalizes a huge number of people, insulting many. One of whom proudly and rightly states: YOU DON’T KNOW ME. It’s true. She doesn’t.
So, to those of you with early January birthdays, I salute you. You must find some way to get back to the grind on your special day in a month that can be the dreariest of the entire calendar.

This was the third time I’d spotted him in the last few days, and he explained to me that the kite surfers have been waiting six months for conditions like these. His name is Russell and he shared with me his secret weapon – the thick neoprene gloves that keep his hands warm are fine for the control bar that steers his power source but would presumably be too thick to hold the larger boom used to steer when windsurfing.

We are troubled by saved people. In Matthew, a woman came to Jesus and began to wash His feet with a precious ointment. The disciples didn't like the "waste", and they criticized the woman. Jesus said, "Why trouble ye the woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon me" (Mt. 26:10). In the Book of Acts, the new converts were troubled because the saved people were trying to put them under the Law that was not meant for them (Acts 15:24). Saved people cause us trouble.
Okay, that's it for Onam. Oh, actually, that wasn't it for Onam itself, but my camera battery died during our meal. After we ate, we played traditional games (SO FUN) and that took a few hours. It would have been cool to have pictures, but at the same time, it was awesome not lugging that big camera around and instead just hanging out with the Bandhavi girls (and learning the words for ear, eye, nose, mouth, teeth, tongue, lip, chin, etc. in Kannada) and enjoying the games.

Well, the big news this week is that of the 36 eggs I had in my incubator (from my own chickens) 27 of them hatched. I wrote a post about baby chicks last year, so I won’t go into great detail on how it all works. But I started the eggs warming on March 12th, and by March 30th (two days early, which means my incubator was running a bit warm – even with two new thermometers to monitor the temp.) the first chick had hatched. By the morning of April 2nd, the last one was out of the shell.
Despite widespread, vocal opposition, Obamacare was forced upon an unwilling America and now we are learning it will increase costs and deny care, just as we knew it would.
I decided to break out of my comfort zone and use tape to create a sharp outer wing. I never wing out my eyeshadow because I can't usually figure out the right angle for my eye shape. Some people can do their crease colour and then use makeup remover and a cotton bud to create a wing, but that doesn't work for the rounded colour placement I usually do. The tape was uncomfortable as hell but I guess I finally figured it out! I also ventured out of my comfort zone by using eyeshadows wet, which I usually try to avoid at all costs because I'm lazy as fuck XD
The yellow flame of a brass lamp on the wall next to the bolted door suddenly lit itself. Johan looked out the window again. He no longer felt quite sure if it should be dark outside, or light. He could not seem to remember what time of day it should be. It was, in fact, dark outside. The wind in the room swirled leaves across the floor as the cobwebs in the corners billowed strangely. The window was closed. Johan shuddered involuntarily.
One can hide one's true self from others - for the benefit of not having to allow them to deal with the variances within one's own sense of self - but one cannot hide from themselves forever either. Like matter and anti-matter colliding, where these two meet is not the question, it is a matter of when... and then how the new order in one's universe then reshapes as a result.

Anyway, I’m a huge fan of the hilarious video movie reviews over at RedLetterMedia.com and often share many of the thoughts and opinions of Mike and Jay from their review show “Half in the Bag”. They posted their review of “The Avengers” today and after watching it I realized that most of my review would seem like i was just plagiarizing their critique if I wrote it all here. So rather than write an uninspired review of the movie that would basically just repeat many of their view points I’ve decided to just upload their review for your viewing pleasure. If you’ve never seen any of their stuff you’re in for a treat, but be forewarned; ”Half in the Bag” is not your standard movie review show. So check out the latest antics of Mike and Jay, and I’ll be back with part 2 of my “Avengers” review once I get the chance to see the movie again.

Haye didn't like this and argued that the Klitschko team had agreed terms with him and were now backing out. Chisora got involved in a slanging match, found that he didn't have the brains to come up with anything more interesting than "How's your toe?" and decided to square off. He approached Haye, gave him a little shove and Haye hit Chisora with a left then a right with the bottle in his hand. A melee ensued and Chisora's trainer got caught with a shot:

I’m a champion for the flipped classroom model (at least for my version of it). But I don’t want to see teacher-led discussions fall out of favour altogether. A skilled classroom teacher can make a live “talk” inspiring for students. I still explain some topics to students in class. The critical thing is to purposefully discern which topics lend themselves to being automated in a podcast or vodcast, and which will be more enchanting if explained ‘live’.

I sometimes cover an entire iced cake with fondant icing like the Star Wars cake and the Rapunzel cake. Think of fondant as pie crust. You roll it out to about 1/8 inch thick, or less if you can manage it, and lay it over the cake. Avoid touching it with your fingernails as it will leave a mark that is hard to remove.

Slice the chunk of steak across grain into long, thin strips. Combine the fish sauce, soy sauce, oil, Sriracha, brown sugar, cilantro, garlic, and remaining seasonings in a small bowl. Place the steaks in a large sealable container (or Ziploc bag), pour in the marinade, seal and toss to evenly distribute. Let marinate in the refrigerator overnight. When ready to cook, weave meat onto individual skewers and lay flat in shallow container. Heat a grill pan over high heat. Place the skewers on the grill pan and cook until the meat is cooked through, about 7 minutes, flipping them over halfway through grilling. Transfer to a platter, sprinkle with cilantro, and serve.

The dreaded c-word.
Secondly, the idea that the 360 exercises should all be perfect is to deny the trainees the opportunity to explore how they affect those around them, their impact on other team members, and how they appear to the outside world. Instead of being a tool for revealing attributes which might require consideration, reflection and development, the tool becomes one which reinforces the status quo and fails to fulfil its intended role. Instead of being a tool for revealing aspects of ones personality and behaviour, it becomes a whitewash, masquerading as a genuine assessment, but in truth being only a paper exercise. ( and to keep on with the greek quotes – Socrates pointed out that “The unexamined life is not worth living”)
Everything about Christianity can be justified within the context of Christian belief. That is, if you accept its terms. . . . That is why you can never reason true Christians out of the faith. It’s not, as the adage has it, because they were never reasoned into it – many were – it’s that faith is a logical door which locks behind you. (30)

Because it isn't a day spa at all (silly Californian). It's an authentic hammam (Turkish bath), just like the name says. So instead of soft lighting, aromatherapy and discretion, you get colorful Moroccan tiles, a large soaking pool and treatment stalls complete with hoses and squeegees to tidy up between clients.
Many seekers are put off by the idea of confronting their darkness. We like to imagine spiritual life as sweetness, kindness, the loving parent we never had. Our own darkness is like a guardian of the threshold, separating those who have the courage and conviction to make this journey from those who are spiritual window-shoppers, or seekers looking for a “quick fix.” Once I was giving a dream workshop and a woman asked me why she never dreamed. I said, “Maybe you are so balanced and so much in touch with your inner nature that you don’t need to dream?” “No,” she honestly replied. “Then maybe you don’t want to deal with what your dreams will tell you?” She protested that she wanted to know what her dreams could reveal. “Well then, are you prepared to spend the next three to five years discovering what an unpleasant person you are?” I will always admire the honesty with which she replied, “Oh no!”

I imagine you’ve watched the video above before arriving at these words. I don’t blame you. The last discussion I attended was a mix of fuck robots, sex worker and queer technologies talk. Whilst this was panning out, we watched Liad Hussein Kantorowicz as she worked. She was on one side of the stage, set up her webcam and received her clients whilst we gawped. The initial 20 minutes was distracting on all levels. This settled and what was shown was the reality of the client’s ‘view’ of a beautiful woman’s body – performing on screen. What we saw was the live version, whilst she ate pizza out of shot and applauded the speakers that were continuing their discussion.

But that was not all. These wonderful volunteers came laden with gifts. Toys for the little ones and a huge purse meant to purchase what was needed. Thanks to their generosity and the generosity of their institution and friends project why was able to purchase much needed coolers and fans to beat the summer heat, oodles of mats to replace the tattered ones, stationery and much more, and even repair the roof of the women centre. But still the purse remained heavy and it was decided that we would keep the money and use it as and when needed.

We had a LOT of candy canes left over from the holidays (secretly I bought more than we needed with the hopes that I could make these this year). It also helps that my husband LOVES candy canes so I had excuse to buy boxes and boxes of candy canes, especially when they went on super clearance after the holidays.
If any of you have problems with chronic dry eye, you understand what I deal with every day. For those that don’t, just thinking about trying to explain the hassles and discomfort makes me want to crawl into bed all depressed and take a nap. But I’m not going to whine about it or get into treatment methods and such (Treatment methods. Ha! As if.) Today I’m on the hunt for sunglasses.

Morgan’s parents were devastated… and determined. Two years after their precious daughter died, Steven Adams and Joan Slaughter joined the Oncology Advisory Board at The Children’s Hospital in Denver to learn more about research and treatment options. They wanted to give directly to an incredible team of doctors in Denver who would put the funds immediately into leading-edge research and treatments. Joan and Steven asked a small group of friends to help host a fundraiser. On a cold night in February, 2001, artma (art for Morgan Adams) artmaonline.org was born. Hundreds of regional and national artists donated and hundreds of art-lovers showed up. The night was nothing short of magical, and the Morgan Adams Foundation was officially launched. www.morganadamsfoundation.org artma became a bi-annual event, and in 2003 they added a second benefit event, the Morgan Adams Concours d’Elegance (a fancy car and airplane show that has been very successful). Last year, the Morgan Adams Foundation celebrated its $1 million milestone in donations to Pediatric Oncology Research.
So I've had the last few weeks to process this information and get ready for the next phase of tackling it. Later this week I'll be getting a continuous glucose monitor to use in tracking my blood sugar levels at all times. It requires inserting something under the skin of my stomach, and I'll be wearing a device that resembles a pager to track it all. It's actually a really cool technology, and should help give me better information to modulate my medications as needed. And it comes in a purple case, so you can't beat that. I'm doing insulin shots with meals in addition to my long-acting nighttime insulin, and depending on how things go with the monitor, I will consider the possibility of adding an insulin pump. But one thing at a time - this one change is overwhelming enough. But as my friend Stephanie said, today it seems like a mountain. Soon, it will just seem like a blip on the radar.
We entered the library eager to hear his stories but I felt a little unprepared. I hadn't read his books. I didn't discuss his visit with the children beforehand. We hadn't created a list of questions. We went in cold.
I've always had difficulty being genuinely creative, and a big part of that is because I have always approached the study of art with a preoccupation on mimicry. Of course, this is natural, as many if not most artists early in their careers produce work that has been inspired by the work of another. This tendency manifests itself across the board, whether in painting, writing, music, or of course, dance. Eventually, should the artist persevere, he has a tendency to evolve, and one of the earmarks of evolution is the finding of one's own voice. Perhaps I haven't endured long enough in my pursuits of different artistic avenues to get to that point.
I know I'll have people tell me that I shouldn't write this here. This isn't the place for family problems. But I'm writing it anyway. I'm writing mostly because I know there are people out there with children who have difficult behavior problems and I know that those parents probably feel like failures. If Jackson was my only child, I'd feel certain that his problems were 100% my fault and I was a complete failure as a parent. That's the thing about ADHD, depression, and other mental illnesses. They're treated like something bad. If your child had diabetes, you wouldn't try to hide the condition. You wouldn't think you were a horrible parent if your child had diabetes. But it's different with mental illness. Since I have five other children who don't act like Jackson does, I can see that it isn't just poor parenting on my part. But my heart breaks for parents going through similar situations and believing that it's all their fault.

Jesus says that he is the good shepherd; he knows his sheep and his sheep know him, and he will lay down his life to protect them. He says he has other sheep, which are not of this sheep pen, and he must go and get them. There shall be one flock and one shepherd. Jesus obliquely tells the crowd that he will eventually be killed, and raised back to life: “I lay down my life for the sheep. … only to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it back up again. This command I received from my Father.” The Jews are divided hearing this. Some of them accuse Jesus of being both demon-possessed and raving mad, but others remember Jesus miraculously healing a man who had been blind from birth only the day before, and say that no person possessed by a demon could have done such a miraculous thing.

Most of us know the great Sugar Ray Robinson. Known for his amazing speed, power, and boxing ability. He finished his career 173-19 with 103 knockouts. He was only stopped one time in his career out of 19 loses, and it was an outdoors fight that was being fought in 105 Degree heat. He retired on his stool before the 14th round started. But possibly the most amazing and also tragic story about Ray Robinson is that on June 24, 1947 in his fight with Jimmie Doyle. It was reportedly a clean fight, with the two boxing it out. Ray Robinson was winning the fight convincingly, but in the 8th round Jimmie Doyle was caught with a lead left hook from Sugar Ray Robinson and crashed to the canvas immediately. He was rushed to the hospital after he didn't regain consciousness and was later pronounced dead. Ray reports that he tried to back out prior to the fight because he had a dream that he killed someone in a boxing match.
If you don’t know, the Vatican Museum ends within the Sistine Chapel, which is where Michelangelo’s painting of the hand of God giving life to Adam can be found on the ceiling. This painting, like all the paintings in the museum, is extremely old, dating back to the early 1500s. Since everything is so old in the Sistine Chapel and because it is a holy church, you are not allowed to talk more than a whisper. There are religious officials and security everywhere who continuously ask people to keep quite. You also aren’t supposed to take photographs of anything because the flash can wear away at the paint. Well, I accidentally forgot about this rule, raised my camera to get a picture of Michelangelo’s iconic painting, and all of a sudden, as if the entire building around us would crumble to the ground if my flash went off, the religious officials and security guards started yelling and screaming in Italian. This instantly caught my attention, especially because I couldn’t understand what they were saying, so I turned and saw all of them staring back at me, and I knew enough to put the camera down. Embarrassing, right? Part of me still wishes I had gotten the photograph. Oh well…

I've never used a computer other than a Mac since then, and it makes me sad to think that the man behind all of the genius that is Apple is no longer here. The company will go on, of course, but without the spark and creativity and passion that encouraged all of us to Think Different.
It is hard to think of another culture which has become quite as diminished as ours has and which has done so quite so rapidly. With our culture, our once rich language has been reduced to dumbed down politically correct mush. Words and phrases which tripped off the tongues of our mother's generation, and many before, have been condemned and silenced for fear that they might offend cultures which a hundred years ago struggled to master the wheel.
Well, in honor of the upcoming groundhog event, I thought I should do a little tutorial on creating realistic shadows for those of us who don't consider ourselves illustrators.
But all concerns aside - be they related to safety or intimacy - our decision was based on what we thought was best for the entire family, including our little dudes. Again, our babies need us close---they need us to comfort them to help them, to teach them, to show them through our actions, even from a young age, that the world can be place that soothes and enables and provides. I cannot wrap my head around how to do that by putting my baby, who needs me desperately, in a crib, or in another room. Intellectually, I get the idea behind this; "teaching" a baby independence, getting mommy some rest, etc. But---I don't know, somehow it seems so unnatural to me. As a new parent, you have to accept the fact that a baby changes your life, not that you change the baby's life. You cannot simply go on living exactly the same way that you did pre-parenting, with the same deadlines, milestones, expectations, and needs. Your baby is not an addendum, an appendix, an appendage, or a pet. It is a human being, and needful and helpless one at that, who needs you to adjust a bit to help them get off to a solid start in the world. Many parents want, and perhaps think that they need, their babies to sleep through the night and gain independence as soon as possible. Sometimes, that is a legitimate need; all families are different and no one way works for everyone. But leaving a baby alone at night to cry it out - to figure it out for themselves - ignores the fact that babies do not cry because they are lonely, they cry because they are hungry, thirsty, afraid, uncertain, in pain, or uncomfortable. They have no other means to communicate these needs, and no means to meet these needs without you. When left alone to try to figure it out, they really only learn two things: how to deal with a need that is unmet, and that their expression of needs will often go ignored.

Why is it that we remain silent about the other injustices in the world, but only speak to the things that directly concern us? I’m not suggesting that the government is right to promote such actions, but when we only activate our political fervor over a few issues that affect our self interests, we diminish other areas where we were meant to be an influence as well. This reveals the selfishness of our sin nature – to only consider the policies that relate to us. This paints a negative picture of what it means to be considerate of our neighbor. It certainly is not behavior that is worthy of the gospel.

Now that I’ve gotten that off my chest, I can comment on the actual episode. I felt that “Undead Again” was all about one person knowing better than another and pulling the wool over their eyes. This plays out in the zombie storyline, but also more significantly in Castle and Beckett’s relationship. In terms of the zombies, we (or the characters) are fooled into believing that they might actually be the walking undead. When that theory is debunked, we see the case of one “zombie” being manipulated into committing a crime against his will and without his knowledge. See: pulling the wool over his eyes. As for Castle and Beckett, they simply can’t keep up their charade any longer, and there are many layers of the charade: first and foremost is the fact that they’re in love with each other and not acting on it, second is Beckett hiding from Castle that she heard him say he loved her last year, third is Castle hiding his knowledge that she heard him, and fourth is Castle hiding info about Johanna Beckett’s murder and Kate’s shooting (which will most certainly come up in the finale next week).

The house is messy. The cats are sleepy. The boyfriend went to bed. The click of my computer keys and the clock are all the only conversations I am holding. All this beautiful quiet time and I am wasting it being pissy. I can’t bear to look at my novel right now. I can’t think of picking up a brush and painting either. This strange frustration began this morning waking up too late to do any writing. I like to do my writing in the morning. At the library, with a contraband cup of coffee. Where there are no phones, no cats and no neighbors with tumbling babies to distract me. But I got up too late and now, when i got oodles of time, I'm irked.
This doesn't mean that I don't love you. I don't delay the release of a book to piss you off. In fact, I try to never set particular release dates for books so I can't disappoint you, yet somehow, for reasons I don't know, I hear things like, "Hollowmen was supposed to be out on October 19th! Where is it?!" When I have never, ever, ever issued an exact release date for that novel. Never. So I don't know where people heard that date, but then they were mad at me because I hadn't delivered on something I'd never even promised.
Does this ever happen to you, where you think about a particular thing, and suddenly lots of things related to that thing appear in your path? For example, an image of a former colleague will bubble up to my consciousness, and suddenly, out of the blue, she'll email me. That has been happening to me a lot lately. In fact, a discussion not too long ago about my finding my best foundation resulted in a request to talk about my experience with laser treatments, which then made me think about how my face looked before I had the laser done, and then years before the mild rosacea made an appearance. All these thoughts about skin and aging skin, and wouldn't you know it. I flipped a page in a magazine and there was Christy with flawless skin, albeit with an extremely off-putting visual of her skin being tugged off her face by a wee bottle, as though it were a taffy-pulling contest.

So I was excited to find this book by Priscilla Shirer. Discerning the Voice of God offers practical advice for God-glorifying decision-making. Shirer takes a complex and sometimes confusing issue — “Is it God?” “Or me?” “Or the Enemy?” — and breaks it down into simple pieces. Will it bring glory to God? Is it consistent with His truth? Is it confirmed by external circumstances? Do you have a sense of peace, even if the decision is challenging? These “tests” make hearing from God accessible to all believers, not just a chosen few.

Rocky IV is entertaining if not taken too seriously. The film is an interesting picture of how we viewed the Cold War in Ronald Reagan’s ’80’s. It is clearly defined good guys verses purely evil bad guys whose hearts are thawed out in the end by clearly defined good guy’s clearly defined goodness. It works on most levels, but itr is by no means a masterpiece.

Paradox Springbank delivers a slightly more peaty note, and feels a little sharper than its Arran sister. A little liquorice, a little more bitter and with light phenolic notes alongside the expected chocolate-caramel goodness. But somehow it has less impact than the softer Arran, and of the three was my least favourite.

In all of this I’d have to have some sort of guarantee that the content I was about to pay for would be worth the money – it’s not (usually) like music files, I don’t want to read the same story again and again.

All four legislators made their inquiries within a few months of receiving significant campaign contributions from ReGen, which is based in New Jersey, but all said they had acted appropriately and were not influenced by the money.

Clearly, one disadvantage we mammals have when comparing our noggins with birds and fishes are those conspicuous ear flaps screwing up the headscape, about as attractive as dried apricots. If your a fan of clean, aerodynamic lines it is a deal breaker. Many times I have seen humans try to hide their ears by sweeping their hair back over them as if an Irish setter were sitting on their head with those furry hind legs pressed to each side. Even earring displays as flashy as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon don't hide the essential truth.
There has been speculation that Kucinich may try to gain a seat from Washington state after losing in a redistricted election in Ohio.

The situations and pressures that cause stress are known as stressors. We usually think of stressors as being negative, such as an exhausting work schedule or a rocky relationship. However, anything that puts high demands on you or forces you to adjust can be stressful. This includes positive events such as getting married, buying a house, going to college, or receiving a promotion.

The years 1919-1925 have been years of struggle in the Export Markets. The Indian markets, in bulk, are now coming back to normal; the West Indian markets are recovering slowly. The biggest market, the Straits Settlements, is now, however, in 1925 only just beginning to show welcome signs of recovery from the trade slump which overtook it after the War; a slump not dissimilar in magnitude from the trade boom it enjoyed 14 years previously.

The problem with The Fog and what it keeps it firmly on the B-tier of Carpenter’s work is that its internal logic doesn’t quite manage to hang together. The film was extensively reshot and sometimes does seem like two films, or at least the mythos of two films, stapled together. Sometimes the victims of the ghost pirates rise from the dead to wreck their own brand of havoc, sometimes they don’t. Sometimes the ghosts are after the descendants of the six people who betrayed them; sometimes they’ll go after whoever happens to be around. It might seem silly to quibble about this kind of thing, but the inconsistencies do add up. I mentioned James earlier and if there was one thing he was damn sure of it was that his spirits played by the rules.

He writes about emotions because those don’t change – although he will research stuff which is current for teens, like texting.

Now, these are fine sentiments, especially the "fables should be taught as fables" part, which is advice Amenábar could perhaps have taken before he made this film. But the "quote" is a fabrication. It was invented by the American writer, soap-salesman and eccentric Elbert Hubbard in a 1908 book entitled Little Journeys to the Homes of the Great Teachers. Hubbard chose Hypatia as one of his "great teachers" but was stymied by the awkward fact that we have virtually nothing of Hypatia's writings or teachings, making it a bit hard to present her as "great". He solved this problem by simply making some up, including the wise words above.
Of course, there are some who certainly would return, so great is their pride in their homeland.

That being said, there is a recent Gallup poll that shows that stay at home moms tend to have lower family incomes and lean toward political independence, rather than either liberal or conservative. Both of these are not surprising to me, since I’ve seen the economics of the “work/raise kids” dichotomy. I also think that it’s fairly obvious that, since they live the reality of the situation (as opposed to an idealized view like Anne Romney has), most moms who stay at home would tend to be more moderate and pragmatic. Anne Romney has had a better-than-average family situation, especially after her husband started bringing in 6 figures per year or more.

Thus intrigued, we read further to find out that this little boy turns into a man that is so fixated with material things that they become his only joy. He continues not to share and we watch what his selfishness does in return. As an old man, all of his possessions leave him and he is left all alone in his bubble. The story ends with this same little boy seemingly waking up from a dream and discovers the valuable lesson about the pleasures of sharing.

Diane Keaton isn’t really given much as his wife, Nina, but it’s still great to see her around as well; Kimberly Williams is good as the daughter, Annie, and has a lot of good emotional moments as a girl who’s basically coming to cope with the fact that she’s not a little kiddy anymore; it was also great to see Martin Short in an extended cameo role as Franck, the wedding planner, and has some goofy accent the whole time but still very very funny in his own way. Such a shame that he and Martin are kind of stuck to doing nothing now.
That being said, the book I’m reading now is a good one. In my opinion as a reader (and a writer), it was just published several drafts too early. I intend to finish it as it’s a good story, and pretty fast paced when I skip over all the internal drama stuff.
The HTC One X is encased in a polycarbonate unibody (Gray or Black), which is matte in appearance and pleasant to the touch. The Samsung Galaxy S III is covered in glossy plastic (with Blue brushed metal look or pure white), which is durable, but not quite as nice to hold. We’re not impressed by its looks either.
random store sobs and giant campfires.
Anyway, I think I will just have a walk around and panic a bit more and then decide to change and look more formal and then change back into my jeans but a smart jacket then a hoody then a long frock which might drag in a puddle so long boots but they need a clean so short boots and smart trousers that need ironing so ...

However, in the recent year or so something similar opened in Hongdae. Snow Spoon. (above) And even more recently another location opened here in Ilsan. And another yogurt place opened called Yogurberry. (below) I’m so happy! This weekend I ate at both. Yogurberry is better in that they offer fresh fruit options whereas Snow Spoon does not. But Snow Spoon does have awesome neon spoons.
The thing I really want to address, though, is the idea permissive parents. As defined in the article:

4. The Kiss of Death by Marcus Sedgwick, which I reviewed here. Sedgwick is possibly my favourite YA author and this was the first book I read by him. It’s set at the end of the 18thC during Carnevale (approaching Lent) and features proper vampires – the real monstrous ones of Eastern European tradition. It’s a great adventure, and the dankness of Venice in winter really comes through.

For first time I took three days to read his book (Thanks to my Office and my phone). The story starts slowly (read boring) but then it ends like “Shawshank Redemption“. One who has seen the movie knows why the movie still tops Imdb list.
My one mini project on the horizon during this challenge is figuring out how to make a batch of chicken liver pâté. While my sourcing of food has overall improved a lot - since last fall we've bought half a grassfed cow and a third of a naturally raised GMO-free soy-free pig - the pack of chicken livers waiting in my fridge isn't from chichi chickens. In fact, they're from (gasp!) conventionally raised chickens. Probably an OK thing as a stop-gap though; I'd rather get a feel for making pate using cheaper materials - and determine whether I like it enough in general! - before I'd invest serious time and money into sourcing quality livers.

St Mary’s not long ago commissioned a feasibility study to see how the church could be altered or extended to make it more useful for community related activities. If the study comes up with a viable plan, the proposed VAT regime would add considerably to the costs of implementing it; perhaps so much so that the whole scheme would need to be abandoned…

Definitely, there are things to look forward to on the next visit to the Philippines (February/March 2013 with either Condura Skyway Marathon or BDM102km as a small part of the vacation). I wish it would be a lot earlier but it’s difficult with vacation time right now. Definitely, meeting the family, Kilometer Zero, Rizal Park, A Runner’s Circle and more are top priorities. In the meantime, continuing to communicate, encourage, inspire and share will be this runner-blogger’s focus. Exchanging posts on Facebook with Phillip BF, Glenda, Ronald, Icar, Jared, Benedict, Shan, Jose, Ian, Edrick, Rhine and many more have been fun. Thanks so much OK-OK family for welcoming me.

Whoever you are, slandering me, or anyone else, I strongly advise you to fear the displeasure of Allah, make repentance, privately & publicly, and never set your feet upon that evil path again. And, you had better do that really soon, because I have my eyes & ears to the ground, looking for you, and you had better pray to Allah that you seek forgiveness & seek repentance, both publicly & privately, before I find out who you are; you’re officially on my shit-list, and for the record, you have to be a real douche-bag, in order to make it to that list. There’s a powerful proverb in Mongolian, which is the following, “Do not scorn a weak cub. He may become the brutal tiger.”. I usually try my very best to be the cool-guy. But, now, I see that I have to revert to bein’ a Nigga bout mines. And, honestly, that’s fine with me, if you wanna play dirty, hell…I invented playin’-dirty. Now, you’ve really fucked-up, because you’ve taken my good-nature for weakness, as though I’m a weak cub. You’ve made a big mistake. I’m Muslim, first. But, then, after that, I’m a Real-Nigga, and a Real-Nigga is gonna do whatever a Real-Nigga’s gotta do, ya dig?!!!

I decided to write about Tudor women because they didn’t have many choices in life: they were often forced to marry (like Lady Jane Grey); executed to make way for a new wife and hopefully a son (Anne Boleyn); or expected to marry and produce an heir (Elizabeth 1). It was also the time when explorers first brought sugar back to England and only rich people could afford it.

I attended a friend’s bridal shower on Sunday, and there was no lack of yummy homemade food and drinks. So, naturally, I had some of everything! But before I could get to that, I had to start of the day with a good breakfast. I really wanted cereal, but I was almost out of everything, so I ended up with a mixed bowl of Kashi Autumn Wheat, Kashi GoLean Crunch (Honey Almond) and some muesli from the Wegman’s bulk bins. I topped that all off with some chopped strawberries and finished up with a glass of Simply Orange-Mango juice. (Even better than regular orange juice!)Then, the bridal shower! We had lots of little snacks and hors d’oeuvres, like pita chips and hummus, bruschetta, chips and such. There was also a little bar set up with both regular and grown-up (ahem, spiked) lemonade, wine and fun Italian sodas. Then, for lunch, a great spread of finger sandwiches (ham and cheese and cucumber and cream cheese), curry chicken salad, coleslaw and macaroni salad and a big Italian salad with grape tomatoes and mozzarella.Of course, some seconds were had. (And a few cocktails!)

Asides from Lola getting on my nerves occasionally, I really did love this novel. There's a huge presence of Anna and St. Clair, and that was charming and wonderful to read about. Lola's family played a huge role in her life, which is always refreshing in YA, and Perkins did a great job with making the dynamic authentic and entertaining. There's a brand new cast of entertaining and unique characters brought to life in Lola and the Boy Next Door. And of course, there's Perkins' ever present, adorable sense of humour.

JW: I didn’t know Dedrick had died. The first radio station I can remember listening to fanatically was CKLW from Windsor, Ontario, Canada. We lived in Toledo, Ohio, from 1965 to 1969 and that station was close to Detroit— it easily reached us. I have three brothers and four sisters, but my older brother and sister were buying 45s regularly in ’66 & ’67. We weren’t buying albums; the first 45 I can remember buying was The Rolling Stones “Ruby Tuesday.”

Gene Howington, a guest blogger on law professor Jonathan Turley’s blog, contends that the government deliberately made the language of H.R. 347 vague and overly broad. Howington writes that “it seems to be a trend that vague or overly broad language could be fairly described as being purposefully adopted allowing ‘wiggle room’ for Federal authorities to potentially abuse civil and human rights under the color of authority.”
The type B collector is someone who may not have a list of certain cards he or she wants, but rather a more general requirement (i.e. Barry Larkin cards rather than 1987 Topps #648).

I have felt for ages that children's picture books lag far behind children's reality in depicting the wide range of what constitutes a definition of "family". And reflecting children's own experience is one of the two most important things a book can do (the other of course being to introduce them to ideas way beyond their experience).

That brings up an interesting dichotomy that happens often to me, both in real life and through this blog. I will take a photo of a wildflower or other interesting plant and I don’t have a clue as to what it is. Some one will identify it and say something to the effect that those plants are rather rare, and ask where I found them. I thank them for identifying the plant in question, then say that those plants aren’t rare to me, I see them all the time at such and such a place. To me, it has always been the finding that has been the most important aspect of being out in nature, correct scientific names has always been secondary, a huge failing on my part.

I thoroughly enjoyed the Avengers. It was better than I had expected which was a pleasant surprise. The cast really came together well, with Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) being the glue that kept them together. Director Josh Wedon outdid himself. Seriously. I'm a huge fan of Firefly, but didn't enjoy as much of his post-Firefly efforts, so I was a bit concerned. Those concerns were put to rest rather quickly. Each member of the Avengers gets a solid amount of storytime and development, even the supporting characters, like Nick Fury, Agent Coulson, and Maria Hill.

Creed and Zelda are now in Kindergarten. They miss their beloved Ecole of 3 years and their friends that they made there, but are adapting very well to Kindergarten. They have dedicated and attentive teachers and classrooms full of new friends.

Of course, we'll invite their old "amis" from Ecole as we try to sift through 22 kids in each of their new classes and find out who each of the twins calls a friend in only week #2 of school.
The band released a demo in 1981 which was heard by members of the band Flux of Pink Indians after being sent to them by Graham Burnett of New Crimes fanzine, who were so impressed that they offered the Subhumans a chance to put out a record on their newly formed Spiderleg label. Shortly afterwards the Subhumans began to release material on their own Bluurg Records label. After the Subhumans split up Lucas formed the bands Culture Shock and Citizen Fish. The Subhumans occasionally reform for live performances, including at least two major tours of North America in the 21st Century, (Live in a Dive is a product of the first) and they continue to command a strong following. Subhumans are known for their thought provoking lyrics.

Dealing with the specifics you mention, some of the matters you raise are commonplace. Courtroom mud-slinging is almost obligatory (!), although in the Sheridan case the personal nature of the disputes seems to have boiled over from time to time. Deletions from the indictment are common in a High Court case and indeed the prosecutor has a duty to the court to remove matters which he thinks can no longer be proved. In addition, in serious cases such as murder, there might be a variety of charges accompanying the main charge, and these are left in the indictment to allow evidence to be led about them, but often, just before the case goes to the jury, the prosecutor will drop all but the murder charge, so as to “simplify” matters for the jury. After all, if the accused is convicted of murder any additional conviction for breach of the peace will make no difference to their sentence.
*Took my first shower today since Friday morning. The hot water felt heavenly. Yesterday I washed my hair in the sink before church. Doug had to help so I could keep the towel wrapped tightly around my shoulders (it was still freezing cold in the house at that point.). First I got my hair wet with the frigid tap water and quickly shampooed. There may have been very loud shrieking. Then Doug rinsed it for me with warm water we heated on the camp stove. Ahhhhh....sweet warmth! Although the clean hair was nice, cleanliness really isn't THAT important when it's that cold. Turns out I might rather be stinky and warm. I'm kind of a wuss that way.

I'm thinking about offering outdoor board as an option at the facility we're building. I'm curious about how people do this when the turn out isn't attached to a barn. I know that run in shelters are required, but how about water? I guess it would be necessary to run electricity for heated water tubs? And I wonder if it's standard to give free choice hay to horses kept outside 24/7? This would work for Dan, but Savanah can't have free choice hay. We tried it one winter and she ate steady and blew up like a beach ball - decidedly unhealthy. Also, we put our horses in when it rains or is below -15 or so (depending on the wind). Do some people leave them out regardless of the temperature? What about blankets? Savanah is like a wooly mammoth, hates blankets and they would be counter productive. Dan doesn't get nearly as thick a coat and loves his blanket - he gets in a snit if we're late getting it on him and then is happy and sweet once it's on. If they're out 24/7 how could you be sure they were dry under their blankets, that they weren't over-heating, etc.? I wonder if it would end up being more work than keeping them in a barn at night, because you'd still need to carefully monitor and check their needs, but it would be harder to do.
You would expect the Leopards to disappear as they now have thick cover and plenty of baby Impala to keep them busy and out of sight, yet since Saturday we have seen, Rockfig Jnr and Ntombela on a baby Impala kill, Kuhanya, Vyeboom Male, an unknown relaxed male and Mbali. My pick of these sightings was Mbali. She has returned to a very old territory of hers in the Central section on the Western side around Lily Pan. This is where she was found on this occasion with a baby Impala kill that she had hoisted into a Marula Tree, this is the first time that I have ever seen her with a kill in a tree, truely a rare sighting.
The second is the Round House Brewery. I don't know much about it other than it will be locally owned and the brewer will be Brian Peters who helped start Live Oak and was brewing at the Bitter End.
