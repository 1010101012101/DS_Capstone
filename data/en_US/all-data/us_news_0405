It showcases the riches of the wine country, a region that yields much more than grapes. Inside the market, which sits on the banks of the Napa River and began its soft opening late last year, upscale offerings include a charcuterie, a fish market and wine merchants. There's also an outpost of Taylor's Automatic Refresher. Hog Island Oyster Co. plans to open in September.

Vermouths, sweet and dry, also belong on the aperitif bar, and most liquor stores offer several brands. Dubonnet, Cinzano and Martini & Rossi are all vermouth manufacturers, offering both sweet (red) and dry (white) styles. The exact contents are proprietary, but the base is fortified wine.

As President Obama makes his final decision on a schedule for drawing down the number of troops in Afghanistan, members of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, meeting in Baltimore, voted overwhelmingly on Monday to urge him to end the wars there and in Iraq as quickly as possible. Although the resolution was backed by the anti-war group Code Pink and others, the reason it got such widespread support was not an expression of pacifism but of priorities. The mayors urged President Obama to bring the troops home as quickly as possible – and to reinvest the billions we are spending overseas to “meet vital human needs, promote job creation, rebuild our infrastructure, aid municipal and state governments, and develop a new economy based upon renewable, sustainable energy and reduce the federal debt.”

As rough as California taxpayers have it today, it was even worse before Prop. 218, written by the HJTA in response to cities and counties around the state imposing new taxes without consulting the public, and imposing new or increased assessments on property owners – often without their knowledge.

"I went over to Brian," Ryan said. "Brian was going to make the call. I said, 'No, let’s take the clock down, and use all the clock and then call a time out.' I think Matt Cavanaugh said, 'What's going on? Are we gong to take a time out?' We said, 'Yes.' I think that’s what happened there. You’ll have to ask Mark, but I think that’s what he heard, is, 'We are going to take a time out.' Mark heard that, he never heard the full conversation that I had with Brian."

MTS Contracting brought multiple systems and several vendors to the table. "We analyzed the different programs and went through various demonstrations," said Jacobs. "The electronic barrier management program (eBMP™) from STI was the only system that exceeded my expectations and criteria.

Some were missing components of information that we wanted to have as part of the database. Others were more cumbersome to use. The eBMP™ seemed to be very comprehensive. It captured all the pertinent data and we have had the ability to roll out an above ceiling permit program through the eBMP™ system as well as document other regulatory and compliance requirements and track those in the system as well." The system is maintained by MTS Contracting. "It does not require an individual to monitor it," added Jacobs. "It is a stand-alone system that doesn't require a lot of maintenance or upkeep."
Editor - I attended my first Pride Parade in 1973, so imagine how many memorable moments I can recall through the decades since. But the one I remember above all others didn't happen at the parade, but the day after, when, back at the office on Monday, a bewildered co-worker reading The Chronicle's coverage of the festivities rhetorically asked why the government felt it was necessary to spend thousands of dollars and employ myriad city resources for such a vapid, trivial display of hedonism and exhibitionism. It was 1999. I had two words for her: Matthew Shepard.

Milla Handley tells stories of her first years here that are as twisty as the road leading into the valley. And in this, her 25th year in the business, she's accumulated all manner of tales. She's been here long enough to see how dramatically it has changed: how it has evolved from a region considered inhospitable to grapes and thus to winemakers into one that is producing world-class Pinots, Rieslings and Sauvignon Blancs. After coffee on the porch of the ranch house, I make my way down the dirt path to the winery's sunny tasting room. It's already busy, but Handley is gracious enough to clear off a chair in her small office so we can talk awhile.

I can say, with honest conviction, that this was Alex's moment on the show this season. His leaps looked effortless and for once he connected with both the music and the audience.

MY rendezvous with the Patent Motorwagen comes courtesy of the Mercedes-Benz company. This replica is one of 150 built in 2003 and 2004. So, yes, this isn't literally the world's first car, but absolutely faithful, right down to the German oak slats on the floorboards. The only practical concession is the use of a modern spark plug instead of the dinner candle-sized ceramic device that Benz invented for the purpose. The ersatz Motorwagen thus offers the identical experience that Benz and his early customers had when they climbed aboard, and occasionally the same Gott-im-Himmel aggravation.

When traveling in this manner, you are constantly hot, sweaty, and carrying everything you need on your back.

The Nets were always just there for most of us, an occasional night out if somebody had free tickets — and somebody always had free tickets. Blame that on the echo-chamber of an arena they called home all those years in the Meadowlands, or the entrenched rooting interest in the franchise across the Hudson, or the procession of bad teams and worse luck.
I hope Miller gets some rest soon. When we spoke, it was a quiet morning, just a couple of hours before a press conference at the west suburban hospital where she was staying.

A survey of Hopper's art came to San Francisco in 1980. A 2007 version, tightly focused on the painter's greatest mid- to late-career works, had a startling power to visitors accustomed to seeing Hopper's art so frequently in reproduction.

“This year we should be pretty close to turning a profit,” Miller said. “Once the new collective bargaining agreement is fully in place, the new revenue sharing is fully in place, we think we’ll be at a point where this organization can consistently be competitive and turn a profit. That’s really the key. You can turn a profit and not compete — just lower salaries by not signing players and not trying to put a competitive team out on the court. That’s never been an approach that (owner) Paul Allen or this organization has taken.”

I can't keep up with all the posts under my four recent "Housewives" columns - what has been deleted by readers and what hasn't - but I do remember some.
