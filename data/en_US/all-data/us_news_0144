At the NFL level, though, a kickoff return sort of looks like an atom smasher, with big men taking running starts and creating huge collisions, hits which the NFL glorified until that concussion thing became too big to ignore. Now, under the guise of increasing player safety, the NFL has removed much of the excitement from kickoff returns with a new rule.
District Attorney Tony Rackauckas announced earlier this month that the refocused investigation linked Ocampo to the Estrada/Juan Herrera killings. Ocampo lived about a mile from where the mother and son were stabbed to death, he had been inside their house before as a friend of Eder Herrera's, and the wounds were similar to those inflicted on the four homeless victims. Rackauckas also said that Estrada's and Juan Herrera's DNA were found on an item of clothing in Ocampo's home.
Martin Scorsese's first foray into both 3D and family films has netted him a Golden Globe for best director. The film, based on New Jersey native Brian Selznick's children's novel, follows the adventures of a young Parisian oprhan (Asa Butterfield) in the 1930s who tries to unlock the mystery of a mechanical man left behind by his father while simultaneously rediscovering a giant of early cinema (Ben Kingsley).
Lasn and White are professional rabble-rousers of sorts, skilled in the art of public protest. They saw and grabbed an opportunity to turn widespread economic disillusionment into a national movement. "World wars, revolutions  from time to time, big things actually happen," Schwartz quotes Lasn as saying. "When the moment is right, all it takes is a spark."
A: I do a lot observational humor. I’d like to say it’s because I pay attention, but the truth is it’s because I’m nosy, and I’m always minding everyone else’s business. And I think that I see things that other people don’t see that are funny. The example I always use is one time I was in the checkout line at Target on Valentine’s Day. The guy in front of me had chocolates and a Valentine’s Day card. And he also had a massive bottle of vodka and an even larger bottle of Kaopectate anti-diarrheal medicine. I was looking at the conveyor belt and crying, because it was so funny. My thoughts were “Oh, somebody’s a lucky girl today.” And nobody else thought it was funny or was paying attention to it.
The gearing keeps the engine in the right speed for optimal performance, but it seriously needs a 6th gear for 60-mph-and-above cruising. The GSR's mileage is rated 17/23 mpg city/highway. That's roughly the same as the Chevrolet Traverse - a full-size, seven-seat crossover. The GSR isn't alone, however, because its main competitor, the Subaru Impreza WRX STI, is rated the same.

India Parker, 35, of Cleveland: Sentencing Thursday by Judge Timothy McCormick for leaving her dead 5-year-old daughter, Kaliyah Parker, in her bed for about a week in late 2006, then putting the body in a trash bag and can, which was emptied by Cleveland sanitation workers. Parker pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and offenses against a human corpse. Parker had told her mother that Kaliyah was living with her paternal grandmother. The charges were filed after she told the father of her 8-year-old son that Kaliyah died when a bookcase fell on her. He called children services.

Unlike slang, regionalisms have staying power. And their origins can be traced to a particular geographic area. Author Tom Wolfe consulted DARE when writing about the Blue Ridge Mountains in I am Charlotte Simmons. Doctors have used it to diagnose illnesses. Detectives in a child abduction case narrowed their suspect list based on a ransom note demanding money be dropped on a devil strip. That's how folks from northeast Ohio describe that strip of grass between the sidewalk and the street.

"The first CD still had my hip-hop roots on it, and this one drives more toward an electronic synth-pop sound comparable to Depeche Mode, a little bit of Cure and even modern artists like Chromeo. It's poppy-electronic music, but there's still an element of darkness to it." The trio hopes the new album, which includes the anthemic title track and the melancholic "Missing Balfour," opens doors for more regional touring, including a possible trip to Austin, Texas' South by Southwest music conference.

The film then goes in a pretty disturbing direction, with images of the Berlin Wall and tanks turning to images of Adolf Hitler and his scientists exterminating the physically or mentally handicapped. Stein meets with the author of "From Darwin to Hitler" and then discusses how Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger and other Americans were leading proponents of eugenics. Next thing you know, Stein is at Dachau, where he says, "Evil can sometimes be rationalized by science," and strongly implies all this could happen again -- I guess if we don't reject Darwinism?

One in four girls and one in six boys will become victims of sexual abuse before their 18th birthday. As adults, we must not allow our children, our greatest and most cherished asset, to become victims of predators or of our inaction. We must arm ourselves with the knowledge of how to recognize the signs that our children might be victims of sexual abuse. We must provide for them an environment where they feel safe to disclose when they have been inappropriately touched. And we need to educate ourselves about how to speak to our children about body safety.

You'll also need a nimble mind while reading this volume, as you may be confused by the curious habit of naming hundreds of popes through 2,000 years from a handful of names, mostly John, Paul, Gregory, Leo, Pius, Benedict and Innocent. It's a European history stuffed with the seemingly same swirling cast of characters: French, Spanish, English and Italian monarchs from whom each newly elected pope must re-wrench control.

The “Harry Potter” tale, however, is a far dirtier. By which I mean to say, the entire cast is incredibly filthy the entire 125 minutes. This was a distraction, proven by how arresting it was — during a dream sequence — to see how young Harry looks when bathed and shaven.
Mr. Netzley, from Miami County, north of Dayton, died in July. He was a state representative from January 1961 through December 2000, elected from a district as conservative as he was. Every odd-numbered year, when the Ohio House wrote a state budget, Mr. Netzley generally voted "no." But first, he'd give other legislators, Republicans and Democrats alike, what I called "The Speech."

Essentially, as a group, the Wings flunked. They couldn't succeed offensively against Predators goaltender Pekka Rinne, and failed defensively because of some doozy mistakes. The stars didn't deliver, and neither did the role players.

Born in Brooklyn in 1964, Yauch formed the Beastie Boys in the late '70s with several teenage friends, including Michael "Mike D" Diamond. (Adam "Ad-Rock" Horovitz joined the group a few years later.) At first, the trio played scruffy hardcore punk. But by the mid-'80s, the Beasties had embraced hip-hop, and developed distinctive deliveries, none of which have ever been successfully emulated. Horovitz's was high, whiny, insinuating; Diamond was eager, playful, boyish. Yauch played the tough guy, and he delivered many of the group's famous boasts. In early Beastie Boys’ songs, Yauch was mythologized as the wildest of the bunch, the hardest partier and the truest ladies man: “Your girlfriend screams when MCA’s in the place,” the three memorably rhymed on “Time to Get Ill, “ He stumbles in the room with the Chivas in his hand/ Cold chillin’ on the spot at the microphone stand.”

In Kent this past spring, I could see and feel a great intertwining of humans and nature. The cultivated, arable land comes right up to the yew hedges that line the roads; the birdsong seems louder and closer, the scale of farms and roads and vistas suited to human wandering and thought. It is restful and made me want to grow things. April is daffodil season; in May come the bluebells carpeting the woods beneath hazel and cherry trees. In June, the roses, and into a summer of peonies and clematis and on and on.

One caveat: Rauner's recipe calls for soaking the matzo in water before using. There are varying opinions about eating "gebrokts," fully-baked matzo that has come in contact with water, during Passover. Follow the rules and traditions of your particular faith community.

Along with Harrison's vivid writing ("Italics are nostalgic for the movements of hands that can no longer make them."), Larsen made the arcana of the subject absolutely fascinating, while giving her professor character a sense of slightly batty precision and combativeness.

The emergence of Gaslamp mega-clubs inspired a change in local style sensibility. The days of flip flops and sundresses are shadowed by nights of glitz, glam and high drama. Romantic florals are tucked away to make room for dazzling sequins. And as a result, our repressed inner hippies must wait for the return of spring to embark on a sweet desert escape.
Deborah MacInnis is the vice dean for research and strategy, and a professor of business administration and marketing at the University of Southern California.

It sounds so promising: If you chew sugar-free gum for 20 minutes three times during the morning, you'll naturally eat almost 70 fewer calories at lunch and won't compensate for it later in the day.

In fact, one of the women said the university laid out her options and urged her to tell police first.

All around this country in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street there are sister movements springing up as a broad cross-section of Americans have chosen to lend their collective voices in opposition to business as usual on Wall Street as well as in Washington. Occupy Wall Street includes Democrats, Republicans, tea partiers, unions, students, and both the employed and the unemployed. We don't need more coverage from the media on the dysfunctional antics of Congress or President Obama. We need more reporters paying attention to the citizens of our country that are trying in the best way they know to speak out that they are suffering from a system that has essentially abandoned them, as it continues to coddle to corporations and the wealthy.

So when the opportunity came to move to public broadcasting, Douglas was ready. His found his first job, on “Oregon Field Guide,” to be a rewarding experience as well as an opportunity to break down some of the stereotypes that different parts of the state have about each other.

Even that lightheadedness may be a sort of flavor-induced placebo effect, says Robert Pandina, director of the Center of Alcohol Studies at Rutgers University in New Jersey. And, in case you inventors out there are thinking of working on your own instant-drunkenness sprays, forget it, Pandina says: "It is nonsense... It is patently, physiologically impossible" to get intoxicated without sufficient alcohol getting to your bloodstream -- something that would never happen with a bit a spray. Even if you held a whole shot of 100-proof liquor in your mouth and waited for it to be absorbed, you'd wait for hours, he says.

Perhaps I might help pacify his irrational “eradication” paranoia. As avid supporters of the Declaration and Constitution, Tea Party members are vigorous defenders of the inalienable “right to life.” Actually, it’s the pro-abortion liberal racists who tenaciously strive for eradication.

Ms. Rosen beat a hasty retreat, saying: "As a mom, I know that raising children is the hardest job there is. As a pundit, I know my words on CNN last night were poorly chosen." So, indeed, was her self-description as a pundit, which my dictionary describes as "an expert or authority, a person who makes comments or judgments in a solemnly authoritative manner." Some solemn. Some authoritative.

The U-T characterizes Harry Reid's budgetary inaction as "government irresponsibility." I disagree. It is despicable, if not criminal. Further, the noted political back-and-forth is both childish and intellectually insulting. While our current financial quagmire has well-documented roots under the previous administration, it is also true the debt and deficits have exploded to unprecedented levels under President Obama and his willing accomplices in the House and Senate. However, solutions are forward looking and not mired in the past.

There’s one every year. Last autumn, I was doing a show and so I missed Joanna Newsom at Carnegie Hall. I expect to regret that for the rest of my life. This year I have no excuse: St. Vincent was performing with her band in New York, and I guess I was busy playing Katamari Damacy or something. Footage from the show made my lack of judgment manifest. It hurts to watch, but I can’t stop watching. Maybe Annie Clark will bring St. Vincent to Northern New Jersey sometime? Seems unlikely – there’s no room that quite suits a mid-level touring act. Perhaps the Wellmont fits. Report to the Wellmont Theater at once, Annie Clark.

There's one other significant factor. Manning is represented by Tom Condon, the guiding force of the Creative Artists Agency's football division and a former Chiefs offensive guard. He recently partnered with Jimmy Sexton, who brought with him Tebow. Condon, Sexton and their associates handle about half the NFL's starting quarterbacks. I don't see how they and Manning will agree to go to a franchise that already has a CAA client as a starter, unless that QB is traded to another team where he will start.

But Fox and Todd couldn't afford to buy a license in Towson. Frustrated with the existing system, they lobbied state and local representatives, and in 2010, an initiative to ease liquor licensing restrictions in Towson passed the state legislature.

The Browns' No. 4 pick is rumored to be in great demand from a few teams outside the Top 10. Philadelphia is one. The Eagles pick 15th. They have two choices in the second round from dealing quarterback Kevin Kolb to Arizona.

You barely break a sweat, especially with the chill on the Mogollon Rim. If you come early, bring a sweatshirt, if not pants. The trail never strays far from the shore, so it is impossible to get lost if you keep the water in sight.

That the finale featured minimal scoring made sense, given the goalie matchup. Lake Erie's Cedrick Desjardins and Toronto's Ben Scrivens are two of the AHL's best. Scrivens had a combined 36 saves in regulation and overtime, then was superb in the shootout. Four Lake Erie shooters did nothing against him while Toronto shooters beat Desjardins twice in three attempts.

Our economy is starting to come around, but Lansing is not.”

Cutting ties with the club would have hurt the city financially, Cyril Kleem said, but it would have been necessary in order for the city to operate "at the highest level of integrity" and with the full confidence of the public.

Instead, the Jags drafted no-name defensive tackle Tyson Alualu in 2010 and he's helped the team compile an 11-19 record. So far this season, Alualu has 32 tackles, 1.5 sacks and has likely accounted for zero tickets being sold. To make matters worse, the Jaguars then took quarterback Blaine Gabbert in the first round of last year's draft.

At least one DeKalb parent applauded the effort to search out problems. Latasha Walker, a leader of the anti-bullying group Advocates on Behalf of Children, said she considered hazing just another form of bullying. "Maybe that's one less child that may be injured or lose their life," she said.
The Illini made a move in the second half behind center Meyers Leonard, who had 21 points on 10-of-12 shooting and nine rebounds. But while they shot 54 percent for the game, they couldn't stop Northwestern, which scored on 16 of its final 20 possessions.

Hey, Tony: Let's compare this year's Jets with last year's Browns and ultimately Shurmur vs. Mangini. Last year the Browns had the one of the toughest schedules in the league and almost beat three (Jets is the almost team) playoff teams. This year the Jets with their franchise QB Sanchez are now 2-3 (they should be 1-4 but the Cowboys gave them a game). Mangini gave them that franchise QB and on paper the Jets seem to be a much more talented team than the Browns. Fast forward to this year and the Mangini-less Browns have a very easy schedule for the first eight games. Can you still look at the big picture and say Mangini wasn't "The Browns' Next Bill Belichick?" -- Rick DelPrado, Middletown, Conn.
