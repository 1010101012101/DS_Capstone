It’s been awhile since St. Francis Prep has been pushed in CHSAA Brooklyn/Queens. The Terriers lost their first league match since 2005 to rival Archbishop Molloy, only to come back stronger. SFP won a fifth straight league title, coming back to beat Molloy in a five-set final in which Colucci pushed all the right buttons. Then the squad went to Buffalo and reached its first state championship match since 1999.

Sturm said the way Edwards carried herself in the circle and the way she went about her business had a calming and even energizing effect on her teammates all season. And that was amplified when the lights were at their brightest.
For some Californians, Boxer's reliably liberal voting record may be reason enough to give her another six years in office. But we believe Californians deserve more than a usually correct vote on issues they care about. They deserve a senator who is accessible, effective and willing and able to reach across party lines to achieve progress on the great issues of our times. Boxer falls short on those counts.

These arrangements, called special improvement districts, are funded by property owners and designed to supplement city services. They've met with success in downtown Cleveland and other markets. But the fees, often tacked onto property-tax bills, can be a harder sell in institutional districts where nonprofits don't pay real estate taxes.
Marine debris is trash that is found in the ocean or along our beaches. It's basically anything that is foreign to the marine ecosystem, something that mother nature never intended. It was the dumping of debris into the harbor that started all the conflict in the book Flush. There are two major factors that effect what debris will end up in the ocean -- buoyancy and whether an item can be carried by the wind.

Guitarist Nina Diaz has the perfect voice for rock and roll. It's just quirky enough, just assertive enough, just versatile enough to pull off any mood she happens to be working. Backed by sister Phanie Diaz on drums and Jenn Alva on bass, Diaz snarls and sneers her way through "Exits & All the Rest" with a swagger and pop sensibility that leave you wondering why she isn't playing bigger rooms. They're signed to Joan Jett's Blackheart records, by the way.

By the time Hoosiers went to the polls Tuesday, just about everybody except Lugar expected a Mourdock win. Only 90 minutes after the polls closed, Mourdock was declared the winner. With 98 percent of the vote counted, Mourdock had pounded Lugar, 61 percent to 39 percent.
If, after all that visual and auditory stimulation, you feel hungry, grab a quick bite in the café just outside the gift shop or walk directly across the parking lot to La Terrasse Restaurant & Bar. La Terrasse offers bistro-style French food from light (try the beet salad with goat cheese or duck confit and frisée salad) to heavy (escargots in garlic butter or foie gras). If you're a French fry fan, the roasted garlic and rosemary home fries will not disappoint.

By getting the Third Frontier Commission to put $14.8 million in the hands of six economic development nonprofits around Ohio, the administration harks back to an old approach that never made economic sense and that makes political sense only when money is plentiful: distributing dollars like fertilizer from a broadcast spreader, then hoping some grass will grow somewhere.

LaMichael James was hired to be an all-purpose threat.
I've spent a lot of time in the area. My family used to pile in the car for fall color drives along the parkway, and I even went to summer camp here. In fact, I met a boy here when I was 13, and even though our families made the annual pilgrimage to see the change of seasons, our paths didn't cross again until we were well into our 30s. In fact, 27 years to the day we met, we married.

"If there was no Adele or Norah, what would they play in coffee shops and hotels?" one prominent jazz musician playfully asked on Twitter last month, pairing two runaway Grammy winners of the last 10 years.

In "The Tourist," Johnny Depp is asked to play a bland American everyman, in the fashion of Cary Grant in "North by Northwest" or Jimmy Stewart in "The Man Who Knew Too Much." That's a bit like asking Michael Bolton to play death metal or Jackson Pollock to paint inside the lines. Depp adopts an affected, unplaceable accent and contorts his face into whimsical expressions.

Because Carmel Mission is still an active parish, there's more time to linger in the sanctuary on Saturdays than on Sundays, and visitors should be aware that it's also a popular site for field trips during the school year. Yet even when tour groups are on site, it's fairly easy to find a quiet corner for reflection — the five-foot-thick walls might have something to do with that.

"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo" is a sharp departure from Mr. Fincher's previous film, "The Social Network," in the preface of which Ms. Mara's Erica fought a spirited verbal duel with Jesse Eisenberg's Mark. The new film's plot centers on an antisocial network, a Swedish family with a history of Fascist leanings that holds the secret to the fate of a young woman who disappeared 40 years ago. Daniel Craig is Mikael Blomkvist, the disgraced journalist who teams up with Lisbeth to investigate the extremely cold case, and uncovers more corruption than either of them bargained for. A cool actor turned chilly in the Scandinavian winter, Mr. Craig nonetheless finds welcome humor in Mikael's impassive affect. Christopher Plummer is the family's smoothly expansive plutocrat. Stellan Skarsgård puts another construction on smoothness as one of its least savory members.

This in one way is the eternal story of Los Angeles, the city of self-invention. But it is also strange and unique to Chandler. He was too old for this youthful city; he was too different, in his English tweeds and with his fragile wife. He was difficult: When they were working on "Double Indemnity," he complained that Wilder adjusted the blinds in their office without first asking his permission. Chandler's path from failed ex-oilman to great writer is one that is almost impossible to fathom, nonetheless follow.

This idea has bobbed along for quite a while -- for good reason. It could be a huge boon to Cleveland area businesses and the port.

A: The short answer: No. It's invisible to the store clerk whether you're using a debit card as "credit" or using your credit card. Both require only a signature (and sometimes not even that). I would argue that any debit card that can be used as credit - meaning no personal identification number is required - is more dangerous than a debit card that can be used only with a PIN.

Today, the Congressional Black Caucus lost a beloved and tremendous member in the passing of Congressman and past CBC Chairman Donald M. Payne. As the first African American Representative from the state of New Jersey, Donald Payne was a shining example of what hard work, determination, and intellect can accomplish in public service.

He most recently served as the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation Chair where he worked diligently to improve the socioeconomic circumstances of African Americans through research and education.

I grew up in Old Brooklyn. . . . On the corner of State and Bader was The Gray Wolf Bar and Grille. It was a small, family-owned bar that was actually built by my great-grandfather in the 1920s, who then sold it in 1958 to the family who owned it when I was growing up. They had the BEST -- I mean the ABSOLUTE BEST -- fish fry on Fridays. You could smell it all the way down the street. And the line would be out the door and around the corner. I would go to my great aunt's house, and she would call over and order a few dinners for everyone. Then in about 20 minutes they would call her back to say it's about ready, meet us at the fence! -- Joe Dylyn, North Olmsted

She stands just over 5 feet tall and weighs right at 100 pounds. So small growing up that her parents wanted her in karate so she could protect herself. Her sister took karate, too. We are small, and people like to step on small people, says Candace Villanueva, 17, a certified brown belt. Growing up shy and reserved, Candace was the girl in dance class who came alive on the floor but kept to herself in a crowd. So often, Candace felt as small as her stature: until sophomore year at Sumner Academy in Kansas City, Kan. That's when she tried to enroll in dance class at the high school and it was full. She would have to take debate. At first, she admits, she wasn't very good. Then she got it.

Zinfandel: It's not about whether it works; it's about what style of Zin you choose.

Tsao's chicken featuring crispy flat bits of meat in a cloying gloppy "teriyaki" sauce. General Tsao's chicken isn't particularly authentic (it was invented in New York City in the '70s - it should be noted, as was disco, and we know how that turned out), but by employing teriyaki, which is Japanese, Red Violet's is an odd, pan-Asian fusion gimmick. Even if the sauce were the nectar of the gods, at $18 - almost twice the price of a good takeout version - I expect juicy hunks of organic, local farm chicken, not some compressed, unrecognizable commodity poultry.

Bizou's new incarnation, Coco500, opened last week with a menu that showcases Keller's telltale rustic style and lusty Mediterranean bent that she developed first at Stars and then at Bizou.

I am writing in response to your Editorial, published on Sunday, April 29, titled, "The question for Nathan Fletcher: What does ‘move to the middle' mean?" I am a registered Republican who supports Nathan Fletcher's campaign. I have also supported Democratic candidates and contributed more to the Democratic Party than I have Republicans over the past four years. Why? Because I care more about the intentions, principles and intelligence of candidates than I do affiliations. Like many Democrats and Republicans supporting Nathan Fletcher, I did not recently "move to the middle"; I was already there.

Smith's mother, two sisters and brother spoke on the defendant’s behalf.
There are other allusions—to waterboarding, during a scene in which Lawrence is subjected to the primitive therapies of an asylum quack; to religious extremism, when the local preacher ascribes the crimes of the Wolfman to divine retribution for unspecified sins. Emily Blunt, who ought to be perplexed finding herself in a movie so unhinged, is the only human element here that's remotely convincing, plausible or attractive; she's sexier than ever as the dead brother's fiancée, and gives a subtle performance amid a din of dramatic braying. Ultimately, though, "The Wolfman" is a horror thriller that couldn't have been made any worse by the addition of Abbott & Costello. "Sometimes, the way of fate is a cruel one," mutters "The Wolfman's" standard-issue, Maria Ouspenskaya-inspired creepy gypsy woman (a befossiled Geraldine Chaplin). No kidding, lady. Despite a solid conceit, a rather Brontë-esque Ms. Blunt, and sufficient computer effects to amuse James Cameron, this "Wolfman" is enough to make your hair fall out.

The league plays its regular-season games at the Midwest Sports Complex in Queeny Park. However, the Skatium is its regular practice site. The facility is a no-nonsense place for skating.

Chris and I sit at one of the outside tables at Bar Eden and order spremute, a very tart drink made of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, sugar and water, and watch the sky change color as the sun sets behind us.

As an added bonus, these wines remain affordable, for the most part. Many of the bottles here hit that sweet spot under $30, where you'd be proud to bring it to a dinner party but not afraid to uncork it now - and at that price, these wines certainly compete with their Old World counterparts in the Rhone. (Spain, too, figured out that this was a grape it could use to compete with its neighbor to the north.) Indeed, it's rare to have a lineup of California reds that don't tip above the $50 mark.

Nick Provo, Syracuse, TE: Provo was projected as a fifth or sixth-round pick so it was a little surprising that the Ravens were able to get him as a undrafted free agent. Provo, who is 6-foot-3, 250 pounds, had 51 catches for 537 yards and nine touchdowns in his Syracuse career. He is a smart player with good hands though his ability to make the Ravens will likely depend on how much improvement he shows as a blocker. The Ravens already have two receiving tight ends and they need a good blocker at the No.3 tight end spot.

On the surface, this Italian dramedy about a troubled cardinal reluctant to accept his election to the papacy is a likable, understated farce. Look closer and you'll see that it has serious issues on its mind. The opening scene has the church leadership literally bumbling around in the dark thanks to a Vatican power outage, while boisterously insisting everything is under control. The venerable French actor Michel Piccoli (who has played more villains than heroes for the likes of Chabrol and Buñuel) is heartbreakingly authentic as the reluctant pontiff. In a walkabout in Rome reminiscent of Jesus' and Moses' desert wandering, he drinks in the chaotic beauty of life beyond the cloisters. Faced with that Babel of competing needs he faces a dilemma. As Pope, he's theologically infallible, but he disagrees with God's decision that he should lead the church. -COLIN COVERT

I took great care to keep them in "mint" condition in viewable display cases. I purchased and exchanged them as prized possessions. And I would pour over their values in my favorite collectibles magazines. There was indeed an economy to my collection of relics. Even today, I revere them as a valuable treasure of my childhood, both in emotional and financial terms.

Building such workplace cultures often starts at the top with executives who set good examples. The survey identified three CEOs as top leaders. So we asked the trio — Tom James from the 7,000-plus-employee Raymond James Financial, John Auer from 167-employee ASI, and Barry Shevlin from 110-employee Vology Data Systems (formerly called Network Liquidators) — to come together and share their ideas on what makes a good leader. Each runs a business of very different size.

Her departure has been a sprint to the end. In just the past two weeks, she has been wrapping up work on significant issues that may well drive education in the state for years to come. A committee she co-chaired just released the first evaluation system for teachers tied to student progress.

This week 150 years ago in the Civil War opens with Confederate Gen. P.G.T. Beuregard ordering his troops to abandon Fort Pillow in Tennessee and, soon after, nearby Memphis. Federal forces have recently seized the nearby northeast Mississippi rail junction of Corinth, prompting Beauregard's move. His forces remove guns and supplies from Fort Pillow as they begin their withdrawal. Union forces occupying Corinth essentially control a key railroad line, several rail links between Memphis and other points in the South. On June 6, 1862, Union gunboats and rams on the Mississippi River open up the naval battle of Memphis before dawn, approaching from just north of that city. In an hour and a half of fighting, the Union sinks or captures all but one of the Confederate vessels — mostly converted river steamers — that are seeking to defend Memphis. Spectators line the riverbanks, watching the battle that opens with long-range volleys from the federal attackers. The fight descends into shooting and chaotic attempts at close range by opposing ships to ram rival vessels. The Confederate fleet is defeated. Soon after, the Union flag is raised in Memphis as the city surrenders. A vital Southern city and trading center on the Mississippi has fallen into Union hands. The Associated Press, in a dispatch June 13, 1862, reports the destruction is great around Corinth as the Union takes control there. "The Confederate army has stripped, for food, the whole country north of Corinth, and many of the inhabitants are in a starving condition," AP reports. It adds Confederate forces retreating from the Union forces left behind "half burned locomotives" and spies and deserters report the Confederate army there to be "greatly disorganized, mutinous and deserting."

Maybe Kelly's short answers on Tuesday came out of frustration. He looked fed up. Maybe he's simply over people telling him what to do, and requesting his cellphone records, and prying into his UO email with records requests. Maybe he's irked that the NCAA has circled back multiple times to examine his recruiting-service issue, and that the coach has essentially been gagged from explaining himself by attorneys.
We became very close during this time in Valdelavilla, far from Philadelphia, from Madrid, and from the world. The conversations never lagged. We talked, we laughed, we cried. We spoke of families, friends, how to live and how to die. We explored mother-daughter and father-son relationships, and we compared growing up in different countries. We talked cooking, banking, art, music, science, government, politics, history, geography, medicine, law, ethics, religion, even - guardedly - sex.

He's entering the conversation of the best point guards in school history. There's simply no way around it. Forget for a second about what he's doing offensively, what he's doing assist-wise, hasn't been seen since the Andre Barrett years. In 15 games, he has 109 assists — he had 137 all of last season. And he still has (at least) 16 more games to play. Consider for a second, that Seton Hall hasn't had a point guard with more than 175 assists in a season since Barrett's senior year of 2003-04, when he had 183 in 31 games. Through the first 15 games of that season, Barrett had 102 assists — Theodore is already seven ahead of that pace. That year, Barrett only had two double-digit assist games. Theodore? He already has five. We could be witnessing one of the special Pirate seasons. Even if the Bob Cousy Award committee doesn't think so.

Local, state and federal taxes: With new positions come taxes for local, state and federal agencies. There's regional taxes, such as TriMet's transit fee, and state-specific ones, such as the workers benefit assessment. All payroll taxes, such as unemployment insurance, depend on a company's total wages -- which means employers are required to report new hires. There are services that specialize in taking care of the document maze for other companies.

But how many Americans woke up on Wednesday thinking Mr. Santorum will now go on to face President Barack Obama this fall? Surely the most shocked by the results in Iowa must be the voters of Pennsylvania who kicked Mr. Santorum out of the U.S. Senate six years ago. Polls conducted over the past two months show him trailing both Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich for the GOP nomination in his own state. What does that say about him?
I don't hear Oregon State giggling with relief at the thought of Kelly possibly going to the NFL. I don't see USC or anyone else declaring the Ducks toast. Why?

Last fall, an e-mail friend in England provided me with the perfect solution: the Soren Larsen, a brigantine based in Auckland, New Zealand, that sails nine months of the year in the South Pacific. The Soren Web site, www.sorenlarsen.co.nz, described a trip that seemed to satisfy my dreams of the last 50 years - a five-week voyage from Auckland to Easter Island. Within days, I had signed on as a 65-year-old training-crew member to supplement the paid crew, and from March 25 to May 1, the Soren Larsen was my home. In all, we sailed 4,566 nautical miles (the same distance as Philadelphia to Buenos Aires), and had a truly authentic experience.

A: Arizona is a relatively new wine industry. A lot of the folks making wine here are still paying new mortgages and equipment. Everything costs a little bit more here. Whereas in Napa, you have mobile bottling lines; here they don't have that luxury yet. Yields are also another factor. Most wine-growing regions in the world yield 5 to 6 tons of fruit per acre. In Arizona, they are lucky if they get 3 tons. In terms of perceived value, if you buy an Arizona wine for $15, I think they stand up to similarly priced wines.

In 1992, Ward had 22 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. In 1993, he had 27 touchdowns and four interceptions. His improvement, as well as the national title may have been a credit to the coaching staff, Shiver said (not to mention a stout defense that barely allowed opponents to see the goal line), but it was also a credit to Ward himself.

Now it is time to find a replacement for Sanu’s production. First off, it must be understood that no one player will be able to do this. Sanu was a playmaker, possession receiver and athlete all rolled up into one. Rutgers will still have a very talented receiving corp next year. With the pending arrival of 2012 Army All-American WR Leonte Carroo of Don Bosco Prep, this may be one of the deepest receiving units ever at Rutgers. But depth, talent and potential can not be confused for experience and production. Remember the struggles of Brandon Coleman and Mark Harrison early this year. Coleman does look he is coming around, but he is still a long way from being a consistent playmaker.

Shattenkirk and Pietrangelo are "good players," Weber said. "Coming into the league, you don't know what to expect from them and now that we play against them six times a year, you get to know them a little bit.

ACD is a delayed allergic response, resulting from a substance that causes an immune system response in the skin, that lasts for days to weeks. It can take upwards of three to seven days after the person encounters the allergen before visible signs of an allergic reaction emerge, making it difficult for an employee to locate the source of their rash.

"I think there are some markets where they're actively out selling it (jersey rights) and they're not able to close deals. For us, it's a growing business, and one that we've said in the quote that was in the New York Times today (Thursday), that for us it's not trying to convince the sports fan that a sponsor should be on the jersey; it's trying to convince the soccer fan that we, like the Premier League, have corporate sponsors on our jerseys as part of our connection and identification with the international soccer community. And the vast majority, all but two or three of our clubs, have jersey sponsorship deals  and they're multiple-million-dollar deals. So over a very short period of time, it's generated nearly $100 million in revenue for the league. That's a significant amount of money for our league based on the size of our business."

Toole's mother, Thelma, a study for Ignatius' mother in the novel, was a character in her own right. When she first visited Percy, she dressed in a pillbox hat and white gloves and persuaded her brother to pose as her chauffeur. Appearing on the "Tomorrow Show," the ancient lady flirtatiously asked the host "I ain't something the cat dragged in, am I?" She blamed Gottlieb for her son's suicide and darkly hinted at a Jewish conspiracy in publishing that kept the novel from being published. She was interviewed everywhere, courted by Hollywood, named a Queen Mother in the Mardi Gras parade, and given an honorary degree.

Thumbs down. College football is all about tradition. Young people may like the flashier look, but schools like Missouri rely heavily on boosters to pay the bills.
