You used the homebuyer tax credit. On this one it all boils down to timing and when the home was purchased. Homes bought in 2009 and 2010, with later versions of the credit, don't need to pay it back unless the property has been sold or it's no longer used as a principal residence. Those who purchased homes in 2008 and claimed the first-time buyer credit aren't so lucky. The credit is treated as a no-interest loan to be repaid in 15 equal installments, starting with the 2010 return. In February, the Internal Revenue Service set up an online tool to help taxpayers in this group. Find it at tinyurl.com/irshomecredit.

Rather, the Netherlands' problem is the ongoing bust in real estate, which has saddled households with mortgage debt exceeding 100% of GDP. Total household debt stands at 249% of GDP, the highest in the euro zone.

Woodson doesn't know who's going to start for his team tonight. Depending on whether Chris Bosh plays (his wife gave birth to their child in Florida, but he's expected to make it to New York for tonight's game), Steve Novak or J.R. Smith could wind up in the starting lineup. Woodson believes in having a strong scorer like Smith on the bench to give some vitality to the second unit. Of course, New York barely has a first unit these days, so it's not like saving Smith is going to throw this series in the Knicks' favor.

Permanent brain damage, hearing loss, learning disability, limb amputation, kidney failure, or death can result from the infection.

Certain college students, particularly freshmen who live or plan to live in residence halls, have a 6-fold increased risk of disease.

Messy take-off: John Wayne Airport's Terminal C. A petty, messy government argument delayed the food court opening beyond the Thanksgiving rush, a baggage security snafu turned the departures area into a ghost town on the grand opening day, and everything from valet parking hiccups to distant walks to get around construction made the start-up of the $543 million project a chore instead of a joy. Now, though, it's mostly up and running

It doesn't simply help him in the batting order, but Fielder's easygoing charisma in the clubhouse and eager willingness in becoming the "face" of the Tigers' franchise takes a lot of that pressure off Cabrera. They have grown very close in such a short time. Fielder occupies Magglio Ordoñez's former locker next to Cabrera's cubicle. They're constantly joking with each other. Keeping Cabrera mentally loose is going to be very important as he potentially struggles adapting to a new defensive position.
The restaurant was conceived by Thomas Schnetz and Dona Savitsky, who opened Dona Tomas farther up Telegraph and Tacubaya on Fourth Street in Berkeley. They have abandoned the Mexican theme for this venture. The menu is straightforward, but far from boring. A few unusual combinations and ingredients raise the interest level, including items such as puntarelle ($9), chicory served with roasted fennel, pancetta, lemon-anchovy vinaigrette and shaved Pepato cheese. This serrated-leaf chicory has a distinct peppery flavor that stands up to the anchovy and cheese.

This year's pace should be very contentious, so the front runners will be heavily burdened to endure and the eventual winner should come from off the pace. Trinninberg is this year's silly speed. He has no chance but he will blaze hot fractions for six furlongs and get his name called at least twice. The anticipated pace collapse brings Dullahan into the picture because he is one of the most consistent late-running horses in the field. Expect him to trail comfortably for the first six furlongs. His post position is perfect for a rail-hugging trip, so if he can avoid trouble should be firing late.

UCLA's reimbursements from Blue Shield have almost doubled in the last five years alone, the insurer says.

All rules must give way before the simple need to communicate. Sometimes my characters use terms that are wholly modern. The really important thing is that they shouldn't express ideas they couldn't have had and feelings they wouldn't have had. They weren't democrats. They weren't feminists.

MH: Yes, as it happens, I am writing a biography of Lawrence Durrell, who, as you say, runs the Templars as a theme through his "Avignon Quintet." There is an element of economy in this: informing myself about Durrell's interest in the Templars by writing a book about the Templars! Durrell's interest in the Templars, which goes hand in glove with his interest in the Cathars and Gnosticism (also discussed in my book), is one that is widely shared -- for the Templars have enjoyed an afterlife that goes well beyond their destruction in 1312 and continues to this day. Which is why I deal not only with the history of the Templars, which lasted only two centuries, but also with the myth of the Templars, which is rooted in the foundation of Solomon's Temple 3,000 years ago and remains alive in various forms in the present day.

Now on to time. We expect time to move forward, the so-called arrow of time. Past, present, and future constitute the normal progression of events. For the same reason, cause precedes effect.

In the quantum world, however, certain phenomena have arisen known as retro causation, and exactly as it sounds, a future measurement appears as if it is affecting a past event. This would be a form of entanglement that reaches backward in time, a new form of spookiness.

One jail monitor broke down as she recounted being intimidated by a deputy whom she said saw beat an unconscious inmate. A weeping jail chaplain described deputies calling him a rat after he reported another beating."
The top six finalists were also paired for duets of King classics. Abrams and Reinhart brought their growling chemistry to "I Feel the Earth Move," while McCreery successfully backed up a soaring Alaina during "Up on the Roof." Durbin and Lusk's awkward attempt to out-wail each other on "I'm Into Something Good" was deemed something bad.

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Mich., said he appreciated the administration's plan, though it set a corporate tax rate that is higher than the 25% he has proposed.

However, the beef is still excellent. The fist-size 10-ounce chunk of dry aged sirloin ($34) is poached in butter before being grilled, then served on an oversize plate, more like a platter, with a swirl of creamy sauce and a half dozen leaves of chard; the garnish was so far away from the meat that it seemed more like a mistake rather than something designed to enhance the appeal of the main event.

The prospects are better for the other 75 percent, but most experts advise those who have jobs that pay well to work another two to three years.

And, yet, that $2.5 million jubilee symbolizes the Marlins' revival and so many of their questions: Will the new ballpark draw fans, and will the players keep them coming back? Will the night club in left field always be rocking, or will it lose its rhythm if the team gets beat? If there's a kaleidoscopic display of spinning fish for every homer, does it matter if no one is there to see it?

"Even if his family—that is, his wife, mother and children—were able to travel with him to the U.S., there would be no one to pursue those past injustices. In other words, the abuse and persecution he suffered would have been for nothing. Those criminal government officials would continue to act in an unfettered way, above the law. They would not have to shoulder any responsibility for their crimes. I feel that the Chen Guangcheng incident should be seen as an important opportunity, so I think there should be no rush, he should not hastily go to the United States, because from what I understand from meeting with him, I think that that is also not his personal desire and it's not what we think is the best way for him either."

FARM REPORT (9): Allen Craig had singles in his first three at-bats for High-A Palm Beach. There is a slight clarification on his schedule, one cleared up this morning. Craig is set to play DH again today, not in the field as a Cardinals official originally said Monday afternoon.

The S-Cards mustered four hits, one of which was a double from Oscar Taveras. … Kolten Wong had only his third hitless game in his past 10.

Studios say fans force that solution because they want to see every word of their favorites on-screen; I say that if Hollywood can craft single films out of massive works by Shakespeare and Dickens, they should manage to abridge a young-adult book about Northwest vampires or English wizards.
We're also running into cases where wrestler 'A' beat wrestler 'B' on Tuesday, and wrestler 'B' beat wrestler 'C', but wrestler 'C' beat wrestler 'A' earlier this season. I'm not sure how to tackle that, but I think you're supposed to give the most recent results the most weight.

And because North Carolina farmers are no longer allowed to expand unless they convert lagoon-and-sprayfield systems to waste management systems -- after Hurricane Floyd ruptured hog lagoons in North Carolina in 1999 -- the new model offers a way to expand their farms and profits.
"In Judaism, grace is automatic. We were all created in God's image (b'tzelem elohim)," Rabbi Spiegel said. "We all merit God's grace. But God's grace doesn't negate poor behavior.

MY: Most of the world either knows me for my gallery or for my porn. There is a margin of the population that knows me for both, but usually people are pretty sex-positive in San Francisco and supportive. Sometimes people will come up to me after an event or opening and tell me how much they loved one of my videos, which is a really great feeling. I try to bring a lot of empowerment to the porn I do and anyone who listens to the interviews or what I'm saying before or after the scene realizes that this is a woman who is in control of her sexuality, who is an exhibitionist and is exploring her sexuality in a healthy way. I do sometimes get into "discussions" with feminists who don't understand BDSM and the work that I do in that realm. Some people see abuse and BDSM as the same thing when they aren't even in the same ballpark. That's like saying sex and rape are the same thing. BDSM and sex should be about consent, consensual pleasure, and consensual pain.
"Even the quote-unquote 'Moneyball' people believe in scouting and development because it will always come down to that," Kasten said. That's how the Dodgers got Matt Kemp and Clayton Kershaw.

Tully added that it was particularly hard to estimate the value of this work in advance because it doesn't fit familiar blue-chip criteria. “It's an Expressionist work and it's colorful, and those are two things that are very desirable in the current trophy market.

Though the science for these new tools is promising, the funding base is flat, despite large investments of stimulus dollars by the United States government. The United States deserves praise for financing the lion's share of both HIV treatment in Africa and HIV prevention research internationally. Other donor countries that are contributing to HIV treatment globally should also make simultaneous and significant investments in new prevention methods to ensure that their HIV costs won't rise indefinitely. Governments of developing countries can also play their part, first by instituting proven HIV prevention efforts while being accountable for results as measured by reductions in new infections. Second, they can demand the development of new HIV prevention tools as passionately as they have demanded universal access to HIV treatment.

Why: The De Moors, Chablis masters based in Courgis, deserve equal credit for their deep-flavored Aligote, a grape typically neutral enough that its historic use was in a Kir cocktail. No neutrality here; the De Moor is packed with granite and apple blossom, with tons of acid and Aligote's characteristic citrus-pith bite. The 2009 adds a riper pear-like texture, but it's still as beautiful and precise. (Importer: Louis/Dressner Selections)

Jason Segel, co-star of both the TV show and the movie, and his "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" team, feed us two hours-plus of recycled gags from the show (e.g. Segel's "Big Foot" impersonation) and bits that might have been in the sitcom, but were too expensive for it.
