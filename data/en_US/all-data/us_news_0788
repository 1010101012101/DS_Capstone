"The new exception to the rule that's got everybody hung up is the exception refers to if a wind or an outside agency, like a bee or a fly on the green, had caused the ball to move, we can get him out if it he's virtually certain that he didn't cause it," Rintoul said. "But in this case, we've got no wind. We've got nothing else down there, and the decision specifically refers to gravity. If a ball moves because of gravity, that's just part of the game."
I sent Ernie a letter about a month in advance, and on game day Sunday we got to the park extra early and hung out between the elevator and the press box. About an hour before game time, the elevator opened, and out strolled Ernie. He was greeted by other fans, presented with some mementoes that a man had made for him as a retirement gift, and then we greeted him and asked if he would pose for a photo with the birthday girl. Ernie was his typical gracious self and tickled Aimee's arm as the picture was snapped. And at the start of the third inning, he came back from a commercial break to extend warm Tiger Birthday greetings to Aimee Cooper of Fairfield, Conn. We cheered from behind home plate as we heard it on our transistor radio! My Dad recorded it from his radio in Kalamazoo.
"You can't sugarcoat it -- situational hitting is critical for us, and not only with runners in scoring position," Scioscia said. "We had a chance to move a couple runners and didn't. When you're playing close games, those little things are really going to count."
Perhaps the most interesting reaction has been from conservative supporters. In an article online, L. Brent Bozell III defended Mr. Limbaugh by noting the Left's failure to decry their own who refer to women in such manner. In particular, Mr. Bozell cites the lack of outcry by the denizens of women's rights when talk show host and comedian Bill Maher and comedian Louis C.K. referred to Sarah Palin in similar terms. In many ways, their tone regarding Mrs. Palin is even more offensive than Mr. Limbaugh. Interestingly, Mrs. Palin has also defended Limbaugh, stating in an interview with CNN that outrage over degrading terms is "never.. applied to the leftist radicals who say such horrible things about… women…." I agree with Bozell and Palin, and others, who note the duplicity of the outrage.

A partial renovation in 2006 gave it an outdoor pool and spruced-up guest bathrooms with white beadboard walls and gold-colored fixtures. But the inn still offers a few humble shared-bath chambers; in-room espresso machines, sound systems and other chichi touches that drive rates high — and make the country inn experience like staying at a Hilton with ruffles — have been avoided. After all, Mrs. Plumb would have looked dimly on such contrivances.
Most of the boost in energy drinks comes from two things -- sugar and caffeine -- and the effect is short-term. Then it lets you down. That's why people get addicted to them. Overloading on caffeine also could backfire for you by throwing your nightly sleep to the wind.

Did it have meaning? It's silly to think it didn't. Miami has been playing poorly of late, and if you didn't think the Heat was in need of a victory here, its tenacity should have told you otherwise. If it weren't a big game, LeBron James wouldn't have been playing with extra ferocity.

Actually, Romney comes across like a guy who has a tin ear when it comes to America's economic divide. It was Romney who said that his $360,000 in speaking fees was not a lot of dough. He's the guy who tried to make a $10,000 bet at a presidential debate. He says "corporations are people." And he likes "being able to fire people who provide services to me."

Not at all. There was a line at the box office, and the film started 15 minutes late so everyone could be seated. Even more striking was the crowd -- largely seniors and middle-aged women.

Chronowski traveled south to Fox Baja Studios where director James Cameron and his crew had re-created the massive ship. Because she possessed a "classic European look" and, she was told, resembled an actual passenger, Chronowski was assigned as an extra in the "core group," about 75 people chosen to act as familiar faces for the audience to loosely follow. The plum role - as a first-class passenger, no less-- came with a six-month stay in a studio at the Grand Baja Resort and a chance to be a part of cinematic history.

Back when the Texans probably needed to take more chances because if they didn't score a load of points they were likely to lose. That isn't the case anymore.
But Schmoke is among those who would say, essentially, no guts, no glory: The risks in turning over Baltimore's prime tourist area to a new-to-these-parts street race are immense, especially under the watchful eyes of more than 800 credentialed members of the media. But so too are the potential rewards — from the hope of full hotels, bars and restaurants to broadcasts showing spirited crowds cheering racecars as they speed around Baltimore's tourist showcases.

Pinot Noir and Syrah: These work when they're deeply aromatic, as good ones should be. Syrah should smell like a more peppery version of the holiday feast - warm spice, roasted meat. Pinot goes somewhere else. I've long had a tradition of taking a Thanksgiving walk, preferably through the woods, and to me Pinot should mimic that experience, providing what we often shorthand in tasting notes as "forest floor": moss, leaves, pine needles and earth. There's something haunting about that echo.

That's a fair question since there's no way to know yet, but the one thing that's different is that the Orioles started out like gangbusters last year and then quickly collapsed.

An obvious departure from the lagoon show of the past (Universal 360) is the way guests will see the images. Trashed are 360's globes in favor of three large water screens anchored in the lagoon. Each has base with oversized "UNIVERSAL" on it, but I didn't find that distracting during the show.
He remembered no special talent—his brother, Jack, was the chosen one. But he absorbed his father's stories and he loved to dream and to create, like the time he and his brother built a model of the 1939 World's Fair out of clay and wax. At the movies, he surrendered to the magic of "Fantasia," and later escaped into "Pinocchio," a guilty pleasure during darkened times. The Nazi cancer was spreading overseas and the U.S. entered the war. Sendak's brother joined the military, relatives overseas were captured and killed. Storytelling, after the Holocaust, became something more than play.

One of the bigger mistakes of President Obama's term was his failure to take on energy and climate change as a higher priority when he first took office.

The author, though he plainly states he is a nonbeliever, nonetheless paints a picture of a typical atheist that seems more like the figment of a religious fundamentalist's imagination. In this one-dimensional portrait, atheists are incapable or unwilling to acknowledge that religion has ever served a useful role, promoted any positive behavior, or provided any solace for its adherents. This is just as insulting as the stereotype of all Christians as moralistic, repressed softheads.

Bulls and bears alike generally agree that for stocks to post a significant rally during the second half will require convincing evidence not only that the U.S. economy's decline has slowed but that activity will begin to turn higher by year-end.

At the Sundance Film Festival in January, two dozen entries were snapped up by film distributors before the curtains fell. So far, only one film has been picked up out of the Tribeca Film Festival, which wrapped its 11th edition on Sunday.

Sixty percent of the budget right now is entitlements. Defense used to be 60% of the budget. When I was born, it was 60% of the budget. Its now 17% of the budget.

I led the charge on welfare reform, and we need to use the same thing we used on welfare reform  which is cap it, cut it, freeze it, block-grant it to the states. For Medicaid, for food stamps, a whole host of other means-tested entitlement programs which are already run by the states. And give them the flexibility to be able to go out and design programs that meet the needs of their particular constituencies.

Jason Pruger and Kenji Ota of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank represented the Goldman Estate in this deal, which had an asking rent of $500 a square foot.
America's relationship with Egypt is likewise defined by contradictions. Egypt was a one-time Cold War foe turned strategic partner, a dictatorship with which we did business, even as we sought to forge ties directly with its people. America has given considerable military aid to Egypt, but it has also spent more than $28 billion in non-military aid in Egypt since 1975, including critical investments in health care, education, infrastructure and democracy promotion. These contradictions have continued since the Tahrir revolution, as the Obama administration both unreservedly supports Egypt's democratization, yet must also engage with Egypt's current nondemocratic government.

The first hurdle will be the county authority, which meets Tuesday to consider the plan’s viability. If the ECIA gives the nod, the city and county have to agree on a price.

"Unfortunately, a handful of other victims have taken advantage of the mistake and are refusing to return the extra money that they received," Zayed said. "What they must understand is that by keeping the extra money that does not rightfully belong to them they are now victimizing other victims. The holdouts should also understand that the United States Treasury Department will collect the money back from them one way or another -- and that is not an outcome that will be good for anybody."

It's hard to believe it's been a full 10 years since "Inishmore" premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Company, because it all feels so current. The particular paramilitary organization that Padraic and his pursuers belong to is the Irish National Liberation Army, which is too soft for Padraic, who wants to form a splinter group. But when it comes to focus and methods, you could fill in the blank with any number of groups in any number of countries. Part of what McDonagh's on about, without turning it into a sermon, is the pathology of terrorism – how extremist organizations attract outcasts and nut cases, and what that means to everyone else.

When Portland claimed the forward off waivers, it is safe to say that nobody within the organization predicted he would produce the way he did.

Hickson can serve as a reliable backup to Aldridge, or play alongside him if LA moves to the 5. In fact, after the trade deadline, the Blazers were most effective when both were on the court at the same time.

It's always good to see fresh blood at the Oscars -- Chris Rock included. But it's easy to forget that the expectations are different for comics like Stewart and Rock, whose comedy, to use a trite entertainment phrase, is more cutting-edge. Stewart, like Rock before him, was not afraid to singe egos, going after Angelina Jolie, Scientology, the Baldwin brothers, etc. It might not bring him back, he might not have been the end-all for his die-hards, but he didn't do a face-plant either.

Teenagers can’t get credit cards unless they have a co-signer or show they have the income to cover their charges.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers have been playing hyperkinetically funky alt-rock since the ’80s, although the group’s highest-charting single to date was a ballad: “Under the Bridge.” After building a buzz on the L.A. club scene (where they occasionally shared bills with fellow 2012 Rock Hall inductees Guns N' Roses), the Chili Peppers released a self-titled debut in 1984.

As the "Raw Deal" host for the World Poker Tour, I was a "shooting star" at the event, meaning I had $1,500 deducted from my entry fee and a $5,000 bounty placed on my head that would go to whichever player knocked me out.

While relatively few voters are on Twitter a study by the Pew Research Center found that about 13 percent of American adults have joined the site  it's become an essential tool for campaigns to test-drive themes and make news with a group of politically wired "influencers" who process and share those messages with the broader world.

That's because House Bill 920 requires that voted operating millage be adjusted downward on a continuing basis so the money paid to schools cannot go up when property values or other inflationary factors enter in -- unlike other taxes that homeowners pay. This is the main reason schools must return to voters so often, hat in hand, driving up the costs of securing new money and creating an impression among voters that schools can't live within their means.

The problem: Kennedy had defied military censors to get the story out. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman had agreed to suppress news of the capitulation for a day, in order to allow Stalin to stage a second surrender ceremony in Berlin.

"The worst part about the storms is about the first two or three days after it happens," said John Sinclair, general manager of Dave Sinclair. "We are kind of paralyzed because we have people coming in looking to get discounts, but we can't sell anything until we clean and line up all the cars and wait for an adjustor to come up with estimates on the repairs. After that's taken care of, and the deals set off, business kind of goes crazy after that."

Colbert, who was the chief fiscal officer at JFS, could last fewer than three months in the interim position unless Kasich gives him the job permanently.

Defenders of the Academy say its membership reflects a combination of legacy (memberships are for life) and achievement. But the sad reality is that the membership reflects hiring patterns that are equally skewed.

"I want to turn it into an event. This is the first time I'm doing this show at the Team, because I'm thinking if I do it at the Team, I'll ultimately be able to get some sponsorship and be able to offer prize money. I can't do that at home with a small show," said Leoni.
Impetus toward a resolution in San Diego, however, is practically invisible. Time Warner spokeswoman Maureen Huff declined to speak in specifics, but described her company's total of defecting customers as "insignificant." Fox spokesman Chris Bellitti said Tuesday he "had no progress to report" regarding either Time Warner or AT&T U-Verse, but called discussions with Dish Network "a little more active." Darren Pudgil, spokesman for San Diego Mayor Jerry Sanders, did not return a call concerning the possibilities of political influence.

Still, even the harshest critics who believe the Texans will collapse or limp to the AFC South title with something like a 9-7 record have to admit Smith and Kubiak have procured a lot of talent. Those players must keep producing, because the schedule gets tougher, with three of the next four opponents competing for the playoffs. It's during that stretch when the Texans will need the running game and defense the most.
But finding illegal immigrants who, like El Khalifi, came to the United States before biometric data was collected and records were computerized around 2004—and who overstayed visas but haven't committed a crime—can be difficult, if not impossible.
"Our defense has played fantastic," Strauss said. "Don Baldwin is our defensive coordinator. He comes up with a great game plan every week. Kevin Bohnert does most of our special teams and he has those guys fired up and flying around out there. The offense has been pretty solid most of the time. We've been able to mix in a pass with a pretty good. It has been nice because there's been a week or two when our defense hasn't been as great and the offense has picked it up."

The California Teachers Association says about 17 school districts in a five-county region – Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Imperial – are at impasse in contract negotiations.
The Browns and Steelers easily had the best drafts in the division. I am so happy that the Browns did not reach for needs like the Bengals. Yes, they could have taken someone like Reuben Randle at 37, but the Browns stuck to their guns and didn't pick a receiver just to pick one after the 3 they liked were off the board. This is how franchises are built."
Scenario: Two men in a telecommunications company vehicle are pulled over for excessive speeding while on their way to a customer's home. The driver is a U.S. citizen, but knows his passenger and co-worker is in the country illegally. During the conversation, the officer develops a reasonable suspicion the passenger is in the country illegally, and confirms that fact with federal immigration officers. (The law states that the penalty for transporting nine or fewer illegal immigrants is a Class 1 misdemeanor and fine of at least $1,000.)
Want to make the world a better place and give yourself a health boost at the same time? You don't have to singlehandedly stop global warming or discover a cure for the common cold -- not if you're belting out a couple of heartfelt "thank you's" every day.

“I knew I wanted to do a Beatles song, but I didn’t want to do an obvious one that everyone’s tired of, so we did ‘Cry, Baby, Cry’ from The White Album,” Barone recalled. “I wanted to cover an early T-Rex song, so we did ‘The Visit,’ and I always wanted to cover Bowie’s ‘The Man Who Sold The World.’ The Bowie version was pretty heavy metal , so I wondered how that would translate to cello.” (Barone’s version presaged the acoustic version of the song that Nirvana would perform several years later on MTV’s Unplugged.)

My passion was showing to others the identification marks of real birds I had seen. Sometimes I wanted to show the legs or belly or tail in detail -- not something that field guides generally show in detail. It is such a thrill to obtain a really great photo of a bird I had not previously photographed, or get a great shot of one where I had only a marginal photo previously. I now have photos of over 300 species of Oregon birds.

You try to hit balls out of here, and you can hit one 500-feet and they blow back in, so what good is that.

But Banas gave them no solace that day. In a recent interview, he said Mason's fatal injuries remain suspicious. But there were no other witnesses older than 4 in the unlicensed home day care. And beyond medical opinions, there was probably not enough evidence to convince a jury that the 18-month-old died from an inflicted injury and not from an accidental fall down carpeted stairs, as the provider claimed.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta says the required cuts of up to $454 billion to the Pentagon would be "devastating" and leave a "hollow force."

"I don't make unconventional stories, I don't make non-linear stories. I like linear storytelling a lot. Chris Nolan is brilliant at non-linear storytelling, between his two great masterworks ("Memento" and "Inception"), really. That was non-linear storytelling. I appreciate non-linear storytelling and I go to a lot of movies that have that, but I don't do it. I haven't done that myself. And so I'm much more traditional in how a story should lay out, although there's no law or rule about telling a story."

In recent months, he had said he was working on a project about noses and he endorsed -- against his best judgment -- Stephen Colbert's "I am a Pole (And So Can You!)", a children's story calculated to offend the master.
The flusher is the single fanciest toilet I've seen on the trip, with a marble seat and tiled floor. I don't understand how it flushes, though.

For example, he said, it's easy to tell a kid from West Baltimore to eat more nutritiously and exercise more. But what if the child lives in a neighborhood where it's not safe to play outside for two hours every day? What if the family is stuck in a "food desert," one of the large swaths of downtown where it's hard to find a corner market that sells fresh fruit and vegetables?

Mohamud shuffled into the courtroom of U.S. Magistrate Judge John V. Acosta at 1:45 p.m. under the watchful eye of U.S. marshals. The teen wore a light-blue button down shirt and ankle chains into a court brimming with security seldom seen at the daily magistrate's arraignment.
Flooding in 2009 rendered more than 460,000 acres unsuitable for planting in the North Dakota and Minnesota counties along the Red River, said Doug Hagel, regional director of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Risk Management Agency in Billings, Mont. The floods then gave way to a cool summer and rainy fall, leaving the ground unusually moist even before this winter's snow began. In some places, up to 25 percent of last year's corn couldn't be harvested because of soaked fields.

The heart of the museum is its galleries on the third floor of the building, elevated above the 100-year flood plane and tested to withstand a Category 5 storm. Along with the storage vault and climate-control systems, they are windowless rectangles on the north and south sides that can be sealed by metal roll-down shutters. But the galleries aren't dark, grim caves. They spread over about 9,000 square feet on one side and 6,000 square feet on the other and soar 18 feet, connected by an open, oval walkway.

When she steps outside the pop-music realm, Lil' Mo says that her professional attitude helps her.
He stops, takes a breath.
Perhaps Santorum ought to read the speech again. Nowhere did Kennedy say that he wouldn't listen to faith-based arguments or that he'd freeze church leaders out of the White House. What he said was that the president shouldn't be beholden to the dictates of his denomination's leaders. That's fully consistent with the 1st Amendment, which not only assures the free exercise of religion but also bars Congress from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion."

He did conjure some revealing scenes, none better than the one of him watching Neil Armstrong's landing on the moon on a tiny TV. Shatner was divorced and lonely at the time. His musing on Capt. Kirk's possible tiny role in the space program was a mordantly funny reflection on the tangency of fantasy and reality. Had the show ventured farther and deeper into such realms, "Shatner's World" might have been a much worthier voyage
Only New Jersey residents who think Christie is doing an excellent job as governor want him to travel. Most of those who think he’s doing a good, fair or poor job want him to stay in-state.

“You go way back and you had water-filled helmets that had bladders inside of them with water,” Beckmann said. “You had suspension helmets which just had a little harness inside and the helmet sat on top of the harness and there actually was air between your head and the helmet.

If the Internet was down, the entire phone system would crash.

It's possible for superfit, hard-core backpackers to make it from the South Rim to the Clear Creek camping area - your base camp for the hike to the falls - in one day. It's only 16 miles, but along the way you'll lose almost 4,800 feet of elevation, gain back more than 1,500 and finally lose an additional 550. That's why most hikers prefer to take two days - one to hike the seven miles from the rim to Bright Angel Campground another to hike the nine miles across the Tonto Plateau to Clear Creek.

Those attending the sold-out show were greeted with a warning posted at the door that "tonight's performance includes adult graphic and violent content that some audience members may find objectionable."
