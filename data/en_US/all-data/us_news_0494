For what's ostensibly a comedy, "The Merchant of Venice" has a dark heart and leaves a bitter aftertaste. Loyalty, generosity and mercy are the goods it advertises, but they come laced with bigotry and deceit.

We can already predict that Grace will survive, for psychological as well as structural (she's the narrator) reasons. She's an unhysterical pragmatist who sharply rebukes some of the other women for their praying and crying.

Arnie Gundersen, a nuclear expert who recently wrote a report on the steam generator failures at the plant, came from Vermont to speak at Tuesday's meeting.

Because the downtown site where the proposed project would be built is located within the boundaries of the San Diego enterprise zone, there are several key tax and financing incentives that wouldn't necessarily be available in another location.

This low-key, and at times downbeat, relationship movie isn't for those who like meet-cutes and neat resolutions. Doremus isn't a "peak moments" kind of filmmaker, a purveyor of ecstatic exchanges such as first kisses and hot sex. He's more the sidelong-glances type, a filmmaker who conveys microclimates of mood without characters declaring their feelings. His characters may shy at uncertainty and ambiguity. Doremus does not. He keeps his camera trained on that smudgy line between loyalty and love.
Jim Johnson, who converted all seven save opportunities in September, said he hasn't been told he will open the season as the team's closer, but in all likelihood, he will.

One student on a team would drop the egg crate, while another would time the fall and a third prepare to spring into action to unload the egg -- there was a 15-second time limit to get the egg out of the package. Cracked eggs didn't pass muster, they were disqualified from the roof drop. Eggs had to be perfect to qualify for the next drop and, if an egg broke in transit to the inspector, it was also disqualified -- it could have had a crack in it. One egg even popped right out of its packaging as it landed.

But because Kevin Nashan's résumé included several of the great restaurants of the world - Commander's Palace, Le Français, Restaurant Daniel, Martín Berasategui and the legendary elBulli - we guessed that he wouldn't be content merely as the caretaker of a legacy.
"Wherever we lived, we had beautiful places," she said. "They were beautiful because he made them so. We once lived in a dumpy apartment in San Diego, but he made it beautiful.

The section of nonpressurized sewer line adjacent to the Capistrano Home Center at 31896 Plaza Drive apparently was damaged during pile-driving work by Caltrans contractor Beador Construction, Lavelle said.
What makes this even more maddening is that you are a frequent guest. The A-Club should have been empowered to fix this problem on your behalf instead of passing you off to the main help line. But even when it did send you to another department, the reservationists with whom you spoke should have been able to see your status and to fix the problem -- even if it meant they would have to place several calls to the hotel.

Though Marley speaks for himself in a bit of Q&A footage, there is apparently not a lot of this kind of material, so much of the sense of the man that we get comes from interviews done specifically for this project, and it's a tribute to the strength of the impression Marley left that people still talk about him with vividness and involvement.

Overall, though, the tolerance for excess becomes more elastic all the time. As the construction boom in pro sports blankets all but a handful of franchises, the revenue upside to new stadiums is approaching its peak.

Stead also points out that the more people who visit Zimbabwe's legendary parks like Hwange and Mana Pools (another UNESCO World Heritage Site), the more funding those parks will have for desperately needed infrastructure, and also that tourist dollars help pay and feed the desperately underfunded antipoaching units. Their continued presence is absolutely vital to the survival of critically endangered species like the black rhino.
If the reduction is approved, it would decrease that portion of the property tax bill by $10 per $100,000 of assessed value and the owner of the "average" $482,680 home would pay $241 instead of $290 for that tax.

The North Carolina point guard stepped in late last season and became the catalyst for the offensive juggernaut. A year later, he continues to pace a Tar Heel offense that, for a less heady player, could possess too much talent to satisfy.

This dressing goes well with roast chicken or turkey dinners. You can start saving and drying tortillas and biscuits or bread the week before.

This becomes a substantial vegetarian dish if you use mushroom stock and leave out the bacon.
Bryzgalov stood tall with 13 saves in the first period and another 12 in a bizarre second period that saw the Flyers outshot 12-0 until they registered their first with 1:26 to go.

Smith has asked the Portland Association of Teachers to consider reopening the contract to allow for furlough days, because each day chopped from the school calendar would save $1.4 million. We are loath to support furlough days, because Oregon already has one of the nation's shortest school years.

They had also contemplated replacing the existing staircase with a more open structure, but decided against the change because it would involve moving load-bearing walls, a costly undertaking.

The other issue is whether the entire law should be struck down if the individual mandate to buy coverage were held unconstitutional. It may be more than just a hypothetical at this point, Justice Antonin Scalia suggested in comments from the bench Wednesday: “[T]here is no way that this court's decision is not going to distort the congressional process. Whether we strike it all down or leave some of it in place, the congressional process will never be the same. One way or another, Congress is going to have to reconsider this, and why isn't it better to have them reconsider it … in toto, rather than having some things already in the law which you have to eliminate before you can move on to consider everything on balance?”

Michigan's David Molk, Georgia's Ben Jones, Baylor's Philip Blake and Ohio State's David Brewster are all potential options today.
Walker's two chief Democratic opponents, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk, have promised to close the ideological gap. They've been vague about how they would do it.

The GSA paid $75,000 for a team-building exercise and $58,000 for audio-visual services (to play embarrassingly juvenile music videos starring GSA employees). To give it all a patina of high-mindedness, employees built 24 bikes to give to the local Boys' and Girls' Club. Except the GSA had to finesse its own red tape to do it.

Address safety efficiently. Safety is a critical concern voiced by bridge proponents, largely because of the "hump" in the existing span, bridge lifts and the overly close spacing of interchanges close to the river. The "hump" and the lifts will be solved by the construction of a new bridge. Both the Hayden Island and Vancouver City Center exits bracketing the bridge should be closed, with new arterial bridges connecting Hayden Island to the Oregon side of the river. Overengineering in response to safety concerns has gotten us into this mess. We can untangle it by addressing safety more creatively and by adhering to accepted design standards for the spacing of interchanges.

And the tax bill that passed at session’s end rejected the reckless tax cuts of the last few years for a more balanced approach to meeting Georgia’s fiscal needs.
