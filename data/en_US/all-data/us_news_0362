7. Cardinals sinkerballer Jake Westbrook was added to the World Series roster because, and I quote, "his turbo sinker can play a factor in this series." (From Tony La Russa.) Westbrook has been in dry dock for the previous two series, though he has maintained his stamina with bullpen work and long tosses. He recently had a bullpen session that he and coaches said went well. The thing is: this season has not been a good one for his signature sinker, the pitch that grounded a thousand hitters and led the majors in groundball outs for the better part of three seasons. FanGraphs not only measures average velocity, but also measures the effectiveness of specific pitches in creating outs. Here is the runs saved on his sinker in recent years, including at his height as a groundball pitcher:

Days earlier, Romney made scant effort to defend one of his aides, Richard Grenell, who had been hired only weeks before to serve as a foreign policy spokesman. Conservative groups complained noisily because Grenell is openly gay. Romney declined to push back publicly against the conservatives, and Grenell resigned.

My guess is 20. It started when I was a single mother and I was afraid to go to any foreign country with two young girls, so I felt a ship was safe. One, they couldn't get off it, and if something happened, there was someone in charge. So I felt it was safe.
Federal authorities in New York had sought to cut off support for the group by arresting sympathizers in their East Coast immigrant communities in 2006 and 2007 on charges of conspiring to provide material aid to a terrorist organization.

Dijon vs. Auxerre, postponed due to waterlogged field
Media images of excess and easy credit inflated consumers' expectations of what middle-class life should be like. Sprawling suburban homes and high-tech toys were viewed as entitlements during boom times, but historically, middle-class life was more modest. In the early post-World War II era, families had one car and homes were about 950 square feet, Bridges said.
In the early years of the club, there were annual dinners. As members died, their places would be represented by overturned plates. When the overturned plates began to outnumber the survivors, the dinners became less joyful and were finally canceled.

In October, Hooked took over the cozy eight-table space in U. City's Jeffrey Plaza that had formerly been occupied by Pho Long, which moved a few doors west into larger quarters. The restaurants both have the same ownership, and Hooked's menu stayed in experimental mode for its first two months until landing on its current format, which includes seven seafood entrees and three pastas all at or below the $13.95 price point, plus a fish of the day for $16.95, and lobster and crab for appropriately higher prices.

It is this faith that the U.S. and others are banking on as they seek to revive Haiti's post-earthquake shattered economy by helping the nation's garment industry take better advantage of U.S.-Congress approved duty-free trade legislation benefiting the industry. Once boasting 100,000 jobs, the industry has just 28,000. About 9,000 of those were created because of the removal of tariffs.
At least one of the two persons I dealt with, both of whom are very close to Modell, urged him to do the interview. And, for a time, Modell was apparently inclined to talk. The inter view would be in Baltimore, with no conditions.

Pettitte said the urge to play picked up when he heard that general manager Brian Cashman, on a radio interview, said the team would keep the door open if he wanted to come out of retirement. Pettitte reached out and Cashman upped the ante, offering the lefty a contract worth $10 million. But Pettitte couldn't commit to the Yankees because he wasn't sure how much time he'd need to prepare.
Not my mission, but it is the mission of all bros in Baltimore to come together and make this a more "Bro-ish" city. Because a city full of bros will work hard, play hard and will improve the city's finances. We are the ones who celebrate life with $100 bar tabs at Mother's and dinners in Harbor East.

The loosely organized group has called for a popular strike, a goal that isn't supported by its allies in labor, which must comply with a host of laws and internal rules governing walkouts. New York unions have marched for the past several years on May Day.
Now, though, even carefully managed figures like James are weighing in on national controversies. Such moves exemplify both personal courage and, as important, an America that has suddenly become politically engaged. Indeed, fans now expect their sports deities to embrace that new normal -- and, as James shows, those deities are increasingly responding to the call.
But Michigan's open primary system makes us a wild card. Older voters who remember George Romney and women angered by Santorum's comments normally comprise a big chunk of primary electorates, and will likely vote Romney.

"The only plan they offered to save the plant was a one year trial experiment which was grounded in the reduction of wages by 35 percent - from $12.80 an hour to $8.30 an hour," Workers United said in its rally flier.
“The plan?” he asked repeating a question. “It was nothing. I didn’t have any strategy. My plan was to get in and see what happened.”
For the first time in three years, Infield tickets and Mug Club prices have increased by $10, due to the “elevated” music acts, Chuckas said.

We've built mall after mall, big box upon big box. Chopped up empty warehouses into $300,000 loft condominiums. Rehabbed tired office buildings in the hope that someone will fill them. We've paved acres of parking lots and carved suburbia from the paths of our rivers.
That may be, but Kander and Ebb took a particularly aggressive line in telling the story. Much of it is played out in the form of a minstrel show. The idea here, as Stroman told her dancers, is that they are taking this racist art form "and flipping it on its head." They are in control, using chairs to build a train, courtrooms, jail cells. They double as the young women, their own Jewish defense attorney, and various judges and cops.
"Lord, today I would like to ask for all those who find themselves all alone in a hospital bed. I ask you to please reach to them and bring some support, comfort and over all love to their heart. So they can feel your presence near them and give them the patience, strength to get through such hard times. May your healing touch cure them from all sickness. Amen!"

A woman had approached the desk 20 minutes earlier, saying she wanted to make a shawl for her daughter. She wanted the piece to represent the family's Sioux heritage, she said. Ostlund headed for the Native American history section. The woman was looking for something that detailed the meaning of seven tepee symbols. Her only living relative is an alcoholic, so he can't guide her as she creates it, she confessed.
As executive director of Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS from 1989 to 1994, McFarlane oversaw the merger of two theater-industry groups and their transformation into a prominent grant-making and fundraising organization.

The county plans to solicit proposals in April from property owners and developers interested in buying county buildings or housing county offices.
Doctor shortages could be especially bad for millions who will become eligible for Medicaid, the public insurance program for the poor. In many states, few doctors are willing to take Medicaid patients because the reimbursement rates are too low. For example, a survey of California physicians found that 90 percent were willing to take new patients, but just 57 percent willing to take new Medicaid patients. Nationally, one survey found just 53 percent of physicians willing to take Medicaid patients.
This year's events began with Shingler facing a lawsuit stemming from last year's show, alleging that he hadn't paid Colortone $4,239 for work done in 2008.

A portion of that money goes for the plaque and installation; the remainder will go to fund future induction ceremonies in Cleveland, an event that occurs every three years, said Stewart.
He says his decision to keep putting forth the effort in practice and games is "day by day," which sounds both childish and confusing.
When first promoted out of the scouting role, Snead was named director of pro personnel. He didn't become director of player personnel - which puts a lot of emphasis on the college side - until three years ago.

Marianne Gingrich's claims came on the same day that Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropped out of the race and endorsed Gingrich.
"Our house is an eclectic mix of woods and style; nothing matches. A lot of it is salvage." She folds a crazy quilt made by her great-grandmother from her great-grandfather's ties across the master bed, hangs clocks, tucks baskets atop wardrobes and displays French, English and other pieces throughout. Mary repeats as many as six items, such as botanical prints, in identical frames, or trios of topiaries for balance and order. To avoid clutter she groups and edits collections of Flow Blue and majolica pottery and bisque porcelain figurines. She hangs vintage purses from unusual glass knobs inserted into a guest bedroom wall. To avoid overcrowding, she rotates pieces from the house to the sales cottage and back, laughing that there are price tags on many furnishings in the family home.
Another entrant, Alex Herz, said he's been making films since about age 6. The freshman at Larkspur's Redwood High School, who co-created another festival film, "Spell Tome," made "Need Gas." The idea, he said, came from a New York Times Magazine story he read last year, about a stranded traveler. He gets help from a family of Mexican farm laborers who return the money he tries to offer in thanks.
But my night at the Hotelito was the wrong night. In the wee hours of the morning, a chorus of crowing roosters piped up — probably the offspring of the birds that serenaded Pat Cope back in 1994. They never quite settled down, and neither did I.

Occupy Oakland participants, elected officials and business leaders expressed optimism that the widely anticipated "general strike" would be a peaceful event for a city that last week became a rallying point after police used tear gas to clear an encampment outside City Hall and then clashed with protesters in the street. An Iraq War veteran was injured in the melee.
It's energy efficient, embraces the latest thinking in elderly care, will win design awards and will become a national model, they tell me. The 150 rooms, bigger and nicer than in many hotels, boast flat-screen TVs and roll-in bathrooms. My personal favorite feature: instead of a name tag next to each door, there's a memory box where residents can display medals, photos and other mementos.

On Sunday, seven months after she became homeless, O'Grady will lace up with the U.S women's team in the Homeless World Cup in Rio de Janeiro. When she takes the field at the event, which features 16 teams of homeless women from throughout the world playing "street soccer," it will mark a nearly miraculous turnaround for a woman who, six months ago, was wandering the streets of Portland.
You need to appreciate Windows Phone as a terrific solution to inadequacies that Microsoft saw in existing phones. You can't really put Windows Phone and another OS into a table of features and fill the grid with green checkmarks and red crosses. That approach kind of works when you compare iOS to Android; you're comparing NFL football to Canadian league football. Comparing Windows Phone to iOS is like comparing baseball to hockey. You can't possibly determine that one is better than the other. You can only figure out which of these appeals to you, personally. You're the person who's going to be using it. If Windows Phone is the right phone for you, what does it matter that it isn't the right phone for other people?
"We are not saying people shouldn't be smoking it or eating it. The people have spoken, and that's legal," Perry said. "We are simply trying to organize it a little bit so our law enforcement officers won't have to arrest people who can legally have it and won't have to confiscate their legally grown marijuana plants when there is a lot of crime and a lot of criminals they need to be going after."
Officers were able to arrest the men as they made yet another pass in front of the house.

A. Not at all. The next movie I'm doing is a comedy. It might just be that there's seven or eight years between "Van Wilder" and "Buried." It speaks more to the fact that people in our industry have a very short-term memory.

And finally, for our fourth and fifth suggestions, consider dropping the meat altogether. Make a burger out of fish - a tuna burger, for example - or take advantage of the fact that a portobello mushroom cap cooked on the grill looks a lot like burger patty.
"I am looking in television, but I'm also looking for other things in the communications field because I'd love to keep my family here," he said.

A: It’s certainly part of the way we carry on, particularly in the country. I think it’s those long winter nights you know, you have to do something. My mother’s from Dublin, but my father was from Tipperary, and when she was there they would tell her the most outrageous stories, pokerfaced. And it took her a while to realize they were having a bit of fun. But there is a sense of mischief, and a bit of confrontation. It just makes the day go round, you know.
When it comes to handling broad-headed arrows, McFadden said he can't stress safety enough. He said broad-headed arrows are more dangerous than bullets.
We're braising in a tangy blend of balsamic vinegar and seasoned stock. A lot of the flavor comes from the caramelizing of the meat and the vegetables, so don't skimp on the browning. After the meat is tender, we boil the liquid down to a glaze. Serve the short ribs and their glaze over mashed potatoes, creamy polenta or egg noodles.
Based on Romney's prior wishy-washy commentary, it's a reasonable argument to make.

For many visitors, the crucial lure is the region's well-deserved reputation for trout fishing. Brook, rainbow and cutthroat trout rise to the surface of hundreds of streams, all snapping hungrily at colorful flies on the end of a line or snagging shiny spinning lures beneath the water. For those headed to the high mountain lakes, the best catch of any day is the spectacular golden trout. They may be California's state fish, but they have been transplanted to Idaho's icy mountain lakes, where they grow larger and seemingly more hungry.
A spokesman for Senate President Tom Niehaus said Seitz was "giving consideration" to a substitute version of the pension reform bill without consulting the bill's sponsor, Republican Sen. Keith Faber, of Celina.

Every neighborhood had a five and dime. We called them a dime store. There was a huge Woolworth's on Grand between Arsenal and Hartford. Woolworth's was the big guy, but there was another chain called Kresge. Probably the biggest Woolworth's was at Grand and Olive. When we moved to Grace and Eiler, the dime store was a Ben Franklin. This was part of a national chain. It was on Grand between Eiler and Bates.

I'm going with Matchbox cars, simply because they were the kind I first started buying from Astro Hobby on Chippewa back in the mid-1960s. They were 50 cents (my weekly allowance was a quarter, so it took some saving), came in those cool little matchboxes and would take heaps of toy-playing abuse.

It will be interesting to see how Baltimore looks against Houston in two weeks, especially if they have Jimmy Smith back, because Matt Schaub can handle pressure and the Texans have a good offensive line. I'd still blitz like hell if I were Pagano. (Especially if Andre Johnson's hamstring isn't 100 percent.) Schaub might burn you a few times, but he'll be woozy by the 4th quarter.

The sound of “Album of the Year” isn’t quite as intoxicating as “Tronic,” which was one of the best releases of 2008. That album was a celebration of the city, cut during a better time for the artist — one when his imagination was unfettered. Forced to cope with tough realities, he’s pared the music back a bit, but he’s compensated by rhyming harder than ever. He’s got an all-star crew to call on, too, and Motor City emcees Elzhi and Royce da 5’9” enliven “Deadly Medley.”

ø•The Cardinals' fast start is hiding the fact the team hasn't found a clear-cut starter at second base. The estimated arrival of Kolten Wong- their first-round pick in the 2011 draft - was thought by some analysts to be 2014. But Wong might be on a faster track. After three years of college, Wong raked in his initial minor league exposure in 2011 at Class A. He posted a .335 batting average/.400 on-base percentage/.510 slugging percentage line in 194 at-bats. And Wong hasn't missed a beat at Class AA this season with a .329/.413/.557 performance. It's conceivable Wong could arrive in St. Louis by the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline.

Consider that recent distasteful spectacle in which politicians drove the nation to the edge of a cliff, threatening to send the country into default.

With its low ceiling and entrance via a side door, Thir13en has that feel of a charming hideaway. The room is cozy and lively, but the intrusive noise one busy night showed the acoustics need work. The outdoor patio is lovely and could be even more charming with a few decorative touches beyond the basic tables and chairs.
All of that put stress on outfits not designed to take the beating of everyday wear and tear.
Schettino was parked in a lifeboat, where, he now claims, he inadvertently landed after stumbling on the tilting deck in the melee of passengers scrambling for safety.
WASHINGTON - When J. David Goldin saw the recorded interview of baseball great Babe Ruth for sale on eBay he knew something was wrong.

To help me update my new and temporary digs, I called on Amy Hughes, features editor for This Old House magazine, for moral support. "Just because you live in an old house doesn't mean you have to live in a bygone era," she says. "I grew up in a Victorian house, which my mom slavishly kept furnished in the period."
"He made big shots and made great reads," the coach said. "We had a scramble situation in the open floor. We had a very dynamic scorer and a guy with great vision and good decision making. You can call a time out and let the defense get set or you can try to make a play. Throughout his career he's shown he's capable of making big plays."
Since the 1980s, bloodsuckers are far likelier to be biker trash (“Near Dark”) or beach bums (“The Lost Boys”) than witty charmers; for every “Interview With the Vampire” there are far too many like “Bloodrayne,” “Blade,” “Thirty Days of Night” and “Priest” in which the bloodsuckers are, like Nosferatu’s rats, simply vermin in need of extermination.

K-12 education: Provides $80 million more to school districts than Kasich's proposal and caps a district's loss in basic state aid at 20 percent. Schools still would lose about $3 billion in cuts, loss of federal stimulus dollars and the phase-out of tax reimbursements.

Children who do not get enough sleep often fall asleep in school, have low school grades, have difficulty focusing, and get in trouble for bad behavior at school and home. Slowed responses and concentration from lack of sleep can negatively affect school or sports performance.

"He had this reputation as being this ruthless guy. Even Richard Nixon thought he was ruthless," said Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, who compared Colson to Buckley. "That is so different than the Chuck Colson I knew. He was the least ego-driven and one of the most friendly, kind people I've ever known."
Less real are some of the American scenes. Fred Ward, for example, is a very good character actor, but he never convinces as Ronald Reagan, and the movie’s crude skewering of the C.I.A. is unfair. (To say exactly how would spoil the film’s end — but suffice it to say that the double agent was no angel, either.)

The pair came out with the Apple II in 1977, a computer that was relatively affordable and designed for the mass market rather than for hobbyists. It went on to become one of the first commercially successful PCs, making the company $117 million in annual sales by the time of Apple's initial public offering in 1980. The IPO instantly made Mr. Jobs a multimillionaire.

Marino compared the contract to a severance package. "Most companies that pay severance to their high-level executives include their previous benefits to keep them whole," she said. "This is a standard industry practice, and we have received advice on this from our salary consultant and executive recruiters."
A solid defense built back to front around underrated cornerbacks Jabari Greer and Tracy Porter relies more on mixing up coverages than heavy blitzing. Whatever, it works. The Saints held the Falcons to 215 total yards on Dec. 27.

Bigger, deadlier disasters followed, but they all borrowed from the storylines — morality plays, really — established by the Titanic's sinking: The high-profile investigations ... wall-to-wall news coverage ... issues of blame, technological hubris, ignored warnings and economic fairness — all were themes that played out in the BP oil spill, the space shuttle disasters, Hurricane Katrina, the Exxon Valdez and the recent grounding of the Costa Concordia.

"When Nixon rolls up his shirt sleeves, his arms look like road maps, scars tracing a history of his career in motorcycle racing," wrote McKee.

NV Renardat-Fache Cerdon du Bugey Rosé ($20) Alain Renardat-Fache uses the methode ancestrale for this slightly off-dry petillant (semi-sparkling) wine that's a perennial hit with lovers of the obscure. The latest shipment (from the 2006 vintage) is more forceful and better than ever, with bright citrus accents hovering the layered strawberry and mint leaf. There's a mineral leanness, with unusual nuances from the mix of Gamay and Poulsard.

Dear Carolyn - My 26-year-old married daughter just told me, through tears, that she has been trying to have a baby for a year and eight months. She said she was going to get tested if they aren't pregnant by the end of the year. My only advice was to just relax, stop putting pressure on herself and have fun. That seemed pretty shallow. Any thoughts? - Dad
The look: Some say if you've been to one Ritz-Carlton, you've been to them all. They're luxurious, to be sure, but a bit stuffy, with swags of shimmering drapes and a kaleidoscope of red-hued patterns on the floor, chairs and banquettes. An attempt has been made to lighten the mood with more contemporary art on the light wood walls, but the room still isn't the best environment to showcase this chef's exciting, cutting-edge cuisine.

The folks at Lisse Leggings are a bit controlling when they design their mix-and-match stretch leggings and tank tops. The cotton/spandex leggings, which come in a choice of lengths and leg styles, incorporate a sewn-in polyester/spandex front panel that tightens the belly and smoothes hips, without feeling super binding. Available in regular and plus sizes, the leggings have a 5-inch, high-rise waistband that helps reduce the belly-roll effect common with waistbands that sit at waist level. Tank tops also employ a gently controlling cotton/spandex blend and contoured cut, as do the company's new dress and skirt styles. A new Travel Set packs a pair of black tight-ankle leggings and a black or white tank top into a 10-by-6-by-6-inch faux-alligator train case with double zippers and a sewn-in handle. The set can be ordered with the leggings in one size and the tank in another. Makes a nice underlayer for travel, or wear solo for an exercise session.

Instead, it appears that President Obama viewed his law as a compromise that at least offered the pretense of preserving the role of private insurance markets, albeit under much heavier regulation by the federal government. This led to the mandate to buy a privately sold product, instead of a mandate to pay taxes. For this compromise - or perhaps more accurately a one-sided compromise, but a compromise nonetheless - the entire law is now in jeopardy.
Cotto was never down, though he seemed hurt several times during the fight, particularly in the 12th round.

Still, just because Marriott could downgrade the certificates and not tell you doesn't mean it should. Hotels are in the hospitality business, and no one wants an unhappy guest.

The results of three MLS matches were determined by stoppage-time goals on Saturday, while an additional three games were decided by goals in the closing 20 minutes. The San Jose Earthquakes and D.C. United continued their surprising climb, the L.A. Galaxy barely escaped FC Dallas with a draw, Real Salt Lake called on its super-sub once again, and the Seattle Sounders and Chicago Fire played a heated rematch of last year's U.S. Open Cup final.

Frenchy's Rockaway Grill: Grouper has resoundingly stayed front and center at Frenchy's Rockaway Grill in Clearwater Beach. Part of a small seafood empire, it benefits from the owner's foresight in buying his own production fishing dock and fishing boats.

In Lake Brantley's 20-0 win over Wekiva, it was not so much about who emerged, but what. In fact, George Clayton is in his 15th season as coach at Lake Brantley High, and something tells me this has never happened before — three TD passes in one game, and none on the ground. Although RB Ti'on Green did have a 97-yarder called back.

The atmosphere at City Hall has improved markedly over the past year, which is due in no small part to the deft work of interim Mayor Ed Lee, the longtime city administrator. The city owes him a debt of gratitude for the way he employed his collegial style and knowledge of government to get the often-warring factions focused on key issues. Lee can rightly point to a pension reform deal, a balanced budget and a tax break to keep Twitter in San Francisco as evidence of his effectiveness.
Dunham's daughter, Marie-Christine Dunham Pratt, who lives in Paris, last visited the home in July. She was appalled that weeds had taken over the yard and that the interior was still a scattered mess from previous break-ins.
Yet the chef, who doesn't speak English, still doesn't print a menu. It's up to the customers to tell the waiter how much they're willing to spend.

Many organizations train one or more kinds of service dogs, and in general their programs follow a pattern set by the early guide dog training organizations: careful breeding followed by puppy-raising by volunteers who begin the basics of obedience and socialization, and finally intensive training by professionals. (Potential human recipients also are carefully screened, trained and matched to dogs.)

Fire Extinguisher: We're paid to be in the background. Snack Machine or Water Fountain, they get a lot of attention, but a Fire Extinguisher, you only need me in an emergency. At most, I'll get a polite nod from a player or a coach, something that says, "I'm happy you're here, Fire Extinguisher."

A recent report from State Comptroller Matt Boxer highlighted the weakness of the so-called “fair and open” process used by most municipalities and counties, a paper-thin and easily manipulated set of general rules that result in contract selection procedures that are neither “fair” nor “open” and designed so that local politicians can pick the politically-favored contractor.
Workers in blue helmets are shown on scaffolding preparing the missile, which is emblazoned with the North Korean flag and the name "Unha 3," meaning "Galaxy."

While the apology is good news for the Kennedy family – and a vindication for working reporters – the sad news is that censorship, even self-censorship, is as American as apple pie, especially during war.
This is the type of heartfelt yet suspenseful premise that has the makings of a sensational two-hour movie. Repeating it every week? Well, after Wednesday night's sneak preview of the pilot episode, you'll probably be won over by Sutherland but not totally convinced by the program built around him and young David Mazouz.

In a decade, California will have the first operating high-speed rail passenger service in the United States. This will keep California on the cutting edge of the 21st-century global economy. Because of the system's reliance on 100 percent renewable energy, and its ability to lessen dependence on automobile or air travel, billions of vehicle miles will not be traveled, hundreds of millions of hours will not be spent sitting on congested freeways and millions of tons of carbon emissions will not be spewed from tailpipes.

Meals at Noisette will not be the lengthy affairs that were Couvron's specialty. Demes expects most of his customers to pick and choose from a small collection of small plates. A first glance shows Demes' intriguing sample menu roughly divided into cold plates -- a celery root hummus with black truffles, parsley salad, verjus vinaigrette and lacey potatoes; fluke ceviche with roasted walnuts, capers, breadcrumbs, dried currants and Sicilian chili -- and hot -- braised short ribs with a Yukon Gold potato "sauce," breadcrumb spaetzle and wilted greens with red wine sauce; seared duck breast and confit leg with ancient grain salad, rutabaga purée and port wine sauce.

I love the connections: how this aesthetic thing is caused by this biological thing, which leads to it becoming a vehicle for capital.

The play, which opened Wednesday at Manhattan Theatre Club's Samuel J. Friedman Theatre on Broadway in a production expertly directed by Daniel Sullivan, is more engrossing as creative biography than drama. (Factual events are fictionally processed and supplemented.)

Next, we paired off with our dates for a little mano-a-mano (lipo-a-lipo?) combat. As per our enthusiastic instructor's rules, each partner took turns trying five minutes of techniques on the "passive" partner, who had to remain still and then constructively critique the active kisser's moves. Then the switch, where active became passive and hoped for the best. We were instructed to use hands only, lips only, face only, teeth only -- like the Hokey Pokey with your face. The next thing I knew, the room had gone from students in rows of chairs to couples making gleeful smacking noises, especially when Bartlett brought out the ice, the grapes, the chocolate.

In a dramatic 911 he made before the crash, Mr. Medunjanin is heard screaming, "We love death more than you love your life!" Prosecutors said the call proved that he was committed to carrying out a suicide mission.
“There might be a lot of guys that get to it but not necessarily run a good route and be there on time,” he said. “It was a great play, a really good play.

øNovak Djokovic will win the French Open. Remember, we did say bold. A year ago we predicted that Djokovic would break the Nadal-Federer duopoly and win a hardcourt Slam title. That prediction, though not wrong, looks positively feeble in the wake of Djokovic's epic 2011 (including three Slam titles). The one he didn't win was Roland Garros- and now it's the only one he doesn't have - but he was oh-so-close. Djokovic lost, narrowly, in the semifinals to an at-his-best Roger Federer. A final showdown against Rafael Nadal would have been no easy task, of course, but he had just whipped Rafa in straight sets in consecutive clay-court finals (Madrid, Rome) and he had most definitely, to borrow a phrase, Occupied Nadal (Rafa's head, anyway). Unless Nadal truly has exorcised Djokovic, he is vulnerable again.
