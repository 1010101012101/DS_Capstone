Still, "Heritage" has charted higher than any album the band has done in its 22 years on earth. One of its tracks, "I Feel the Dark," recently found a new life as a meme when a fan used it as a makeshift soundtrack to the little-seen "Destino," a short film Salvador Dali made for Walt Disney. It's a mind-bender-"Fantasia" on even more drugs. "It just happened to fit the song perfectly," says Akerfeldt, who swears the band had nothing to do with it. "It's a beautiful piece of work, I think."

For my stop near Charlotte airport, Priceline worked flawlessly, and I got a $95 a night room for $80. But Priceline didn't give me a good enough deal at my final stop, Warrenton Va., to offset the inflexibility, so I went with the measly 10 percent AARP discount. This time, Priceline scored on only one of three, and Hotwire didn't score at all. But that's not typical of my experience, which has generally been good with both.

That's me, attempting to live up to one of my favorite quotes: "In essentials unity; in non-essentials liberty; in all things, charity."

So who is telling the truth? It easily could be that both are. I believe my source is telling the truth, otherwise I would not have printed what they said. I also believe that James might be wrestling with some aspects of the decision. He loves his teammates. He loves his coaches. He's said numerous times how much he loves the fans and being an Oregon Duck. All of this creates a plausible denial that a decision has been made. That said, based on my source, it is obvious that a decision has been made in part because it is so obviously the right decision.

Rams and Saints fans are complaining that Belichick and the Patriots got off easy. Obviously, the New Orleans penalties were extreme. By comparison, the New England penalties were relatively minor.

"I think what I'm going to bring that Andre really didn't do towards the end of his career ... is really just push the ball every time," he said. "I'm going to pick up full court on defense, I'm going to pressure the ball. That's just the type of player I am. I'm going to play on both ends. Not to say that Dre didn't. But we're two different guys. I've got a big 'ol foot to step into right now, some big shoes to fill.

Lowe didn't finish that thought, but added: "I think the only difference I've noticed is that he's swinging at more pitches that he normally doesn't swing at.

Next, I would list the things that require an effective communal effort: schools, roads, gigantic water projects, recreation facilities, and so on. The schools, in my opinion, are the best in the country. I find three States ranked ahead of California, —Nevada, New York,and Wyoming, —in the amount of money expended per unit of attendance, or population, or whatever it is that they measure by; but I say that money is not the only thing that counts in education. My brief for the California schools rests on the simple fact that our two children did terribly in the East, whereas here they do fine. They like school, learn their lessons, take an interest in what the school does; and so they get a great deal more out of their time than I got when I was their age. Also, they are treated with the utmost consideration, not only by their teachers, but by their colleagues in bondage.

Those of us familiar with NCAA's investigative protocol saw this whimpering end coming back when Tressel first revealed himself as a liar. The NCAA would prove itself gutless.

Buff up the bathroom: Leave out extra rolls of tissue so that guests don't have to go rummaging through your cabinets. Wipe all surfaces with an all-purpose cleaner, then sanitize with disposable wipes. "If you can, invest in a trash can with a lid so no one has to see what's in there," Raymond says. Minimize cleaning: Don't waste time with compulsive tidiness. If you're a pack rat, just get a large trash bag and collect junk mail and other clutter. Raymond says the bag can go into the garage or a closet until you are ready to toss or shred. It is unlikely that anyone will be wearing white gloves, so dust only as high as your tallest guest.

But I sense that some readers suspect there's a real story in the shadows behind almost every news event. As a teenager in the Kansas City area, I often heard whispers that the Country Club Plaza is actually a hotbed of rape and robbery, but The Kansas City Star and TV stations had reached an agreement with police and Plaza management not to publicize the crimes, lest shoppers be scared away.

I'm not too sure what to say about Josh's performance of the Stevie Wonder classic. I'm not sure there is much to say. It was probably the best cover of the popular tune I've ever heard, I'll give it that. His voice was strong and fit the song well. With that, I'd bet Josh would have little trouble with any Stevie song - his voice just sort of works with that sound. But other than that, it was nothing new. The song is fun, but doesn't allow for much range or originality. Josh seems better suited for the ballads where he can wail, growl, scream and cry by the end of it.

The Northern California garden game of chance begins in June. Typically, as the Central Valley heats up, it inhales cooler ocean air, pulling it through mountain gaps and creating a sun-shielding layer of high fog in San Francisco and other coastal areas. But some summers see little fog. Coastal gardeners never know whether this is the year the tomatoes will ripen. More dependable is that mass of cool heavy air sitting about 1,000 miles offshore. Known as the Pacific High, it almost always blocks rainstorms from entering the Bay Area during the summer. So the No. 1 job for gardeners is to see that plants receive the water they need.

There is a lot of luck involved in a presidency; it wasn’t because of Jimmy Carter’s personal incompetence that the 1980 Operation Eagle Claw helicopter mission to rescue the hostages in Iran failed. Similarly, it’s not mainly President Obama’s fault that the economic recovery is so weak — but he is hardly the one to make this argument after blaming President Bush for the 2008 financial crisis. Presidential decisions aren’t always at the core of everything.

Certainly, my gun represents protection for my loved ones and I have no interest in any stats to the contrary. A wonderful, elderly neighbor of mine was sexually assaulted in her home late one night.

The negative interpretation would be that Brown can never quite be counted on to stay in the same place, physically or philosophically.
Sometimes smug and often earnest, Kelly uses multiple examples in the first two-thirds of the book to emphasize his message -- that smart people live below their means and foolish people spend more than they earn. His last few chapters focus on how to achieve what he refers to as financial freedom, emphasizing restraint in spending and discipline in saving. This book offers few specific tips on how to cut corners or find bargains, but does profile people who have succeeded in living his philosophy.
Martin Durante, whose grandfather started Ratto's delicatessen in Oakland in 1896, happened to be on strike from his job as a car salesman when his father asked him to join the business in the 1950s.

For sure the Flounders take the cake. We intensely dislike them and their plastic, bandwagon fans who all showed up after they went up to the MLS. They think because they have numbers and a winning team that they are better than anyone else in the MLS. We'll see how they support the team when times are rough -- that's the measure of a true fan. Vancouver, we are rivals, but we are respectful rivals.

Two shots of rum. A splash of Curacao. And a set of puckered lips. As legend has it, that's what happened when saloon mogul "Trader Vic" Bergeron designed the mai tai in 1944. The drink turned the Trader Vic's bar chain into a smash and marked the explosion of the summer cocktail culture. More than six decades later, tiki culture is a drink some would say has been watered down to resemble anything "islandy" -- in other words, too much Jimmy Buffett and not enough Polynesia. Well, Bahama Breeze manages to make that new "tiki" concoction tasty, thanks to the drinks it serves. The joint has the casual Caribbean-meets-Hawaii-and-other-island-getaways vibe. But it's the drinks that pucker lips. Sure, it does a nifty Mojita Cubano. But the Bahamarita is a must -- especially if you love fermented fruit salads. Imagine gulping down the mix of kiwi, mango, strawberry, other fruits, tequila and schnapps. I'm usually not into these kinds of potions. But somehow, the Bahamarita -- chased by an Ultimate Pina Colada (Captain Morgan's Original spiced rum and Coco Lopez swirled with strawberry ice and topped with Myers's dark rum) -- made me see palm trees and hear steel drums. Oh, wait, that's the decor and guy in the corner playing Caribbean versions of rock tunes.

Passengers on these vessels find themselves being transferred to the new White Star liner for their voyage to America.
However, I want to emphasize the Blues' parsimonious, tightfisted ways. We know about the 12 shutouts already this season. We know that goaltenders Brian Elliott and Jaroslav Halak prevent goals the way Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright prevent runs. The Blues are so steadfast in denying goals, they're moving into rich and rare territory.
"One of the things she said to me was, 'After the war (in the 1990s), we forgot how to dance.' That really moved me, and I wanted to learn more about the Bosnian community," West said. "This was just a group of people that I really didn't know anything about."

The two men fought each other to a standoff, and Titanic turned to his real goal, the fleecing of the Mexican moguls who had backed Trevino. "They were flush, happy — ready to cut the cards," Cook records, and Titanic had arranged a crooked hold 'em session in an underground card room in Juarez, Mexico. But the scam produced no gushing El Dorado, and Titanic's last stand was a bust. He died broke, like most gamblers. In his life he went through at least $10 million yet as an old man he had no investments, no insurance, no checking or savings account.

But while the power generated by waste-to-energy facilities is modest (typically between 50 and 200 megawatts), it's far from cost-free. The public pays in air pollution and greenhouse gases.

That pretty well describes "Dark Shadows," Tim Burton's take on the '60s Gothic soap opera, which features Johnny Depp as a bleached-out Barnabas Collins.

Soderberg is an examiner, a populist and just plain interesting. But who will see "Magic Mike"? It's hard to imagine men willingly accompanying their girlfriends and wives to this skin-fest. June 29

Under the current system, the immigrants who qualify for a visa, and ultimately a green card, must return to their homeland to pick it up.

Some immigrants can secure a special waiver to return, but they must demonstrate that their absences will create extreme hardship to a U.S. citizen parent or spouse.
