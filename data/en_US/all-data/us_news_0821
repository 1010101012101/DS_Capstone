NEW YORK—The slick, anniversary trailer for Dance on Camera says it all.
Fast-forward six months and now this friend and the cheater are of course getting back together. And my girlfriend is ticked because her friend is distancing herself because of the advice I gave, and it's all my fault that her social group is falling apart. So what should I do now? - Am I a Horse's Patoot?
"I enjoyed the people on my unit that I worked with, until they all started to quit."
"You get down 5-1 early and it's an uphill battle," he said. "At that point you're talking about having to score six runs off a pretty good pitching staff. If you did that, I think everybody gets a (discounted soda). That's not something you do every night when you have all your horses. It's just that we have not played well, that's the bottom line."
EJ Shoes is moving into a 9,500 square foot space -- about the same size of its University City store. The building was formerly occupied by a Blockbuster and has been used more recently by seasonal Halloween stores.

Top chamber of commerce and Civic Council officials often decry some of the spending priorities at City Hall. Yet one of the most essential ways to oversee the use of tax dollars is to have a seat at the table in running the huge Police Department.
After telling my friend about the pinot noir, I decided to try it myself, so I went to the Brentwood Pointe store and picked up a bottle for $13.98.

While Andrews was earning all-conference honors at Cordova, Monarchs video coordinator Doug Cornelius was doubling as the Yuba College men's basketball coach. He recruited Andrews to Yuba City and, a year later, contacted former Monarchs assistant Jim Les, who had been named head coach at Bradley University. Les, the new UC Davis coach, was impressed enough by Andrews' exceptional raw athleticism to offer a scholarship.

Goi muc ($7.95), La Vie's version of calamari salad, also tastes just-plucked fresh, but the pieces of calamari were few and far between, and the dressing could have used more punch.
A car window was broken and a GPS unit stolen April 22 in the 16000 block of Chesterfield Airport Road.
Every translation conveys the author's point of view of what the text says. King James set the guidelines and approved the translation. When the King of England is in charge of the translation, the goal is to serve the state. One way to see this is to search for the world "tyrant." It appears in many Bible translations but not in the King James version.
And if a player is going to cheat at the end of his career, why is it a stretch to think he didn't cheat at the outset or middle? We're supposed to believe, as a glaring example, Alex Rodriguez when he tells us he only did 'roids with the Texas Rangers? Proven or admitted cheaters lose all benefit of the doubt.
Warming up for spring
This is in response to the letter from the man who has a love affair with cigars. And let me say kudos to the Tribune for allowing his voice to be heard. I, myself, would never blow my cigar smoke into anyone's face intentionally, so when you pass by my front porch, dispense with the cheap theatrics of hand waving and such. The world is not going to end if you get a brief whiff of cigar smoke.
Stout Rebellion is populated by a mix of musicians with very nontraditional backgrounds for Irish music. Weller himself started out in a Simon and Garfunkel tribute band. His wife, Linda Easton, spent two years learning to play music in order to be in the band ("She began by ordering the 'Davy Jones Easy Tambourine Method' DVD.") Eve Huffner comes from playing with the Zydepunks. James Wilson is a veteran of many Sacramento-area bands, including Whiskey and Stitches, and is adept with a multitude of instruments such as tin whistle and mandolin. Chuck Jamison's ties with Northern California's Irish community are strong (Caledonian Club, Clan Gunn, St. Andrews Society) and he plays bagpipes at military funerals. "Groovy Greg" Cox, an anesthesiologist by day, comes from Sacramento's Off Celter.
The specialty of the truck is the chicken-and-waffle combo ($9.50), and waffles and chicken all by themselves. You can get waffle plain ($6) or topped with strawberry or blueberry ($7.75). Orders of chicken wings begin at $2.60 for two and end at $10.40 for 10.
Jokela and her husband, Mike, owe $188,000 on their mortgage, she said in an interview. Other debts total about $15,000; of that, about $7,000 is a car loan, and the rest is credit card debt, of which $4,000 is related to veterinarian bills accrued when a pet cat became sick. It died in January.
Now for the surprise: In all three categories, A, B, and C are descriptions of the same treatment, just framed in different ways. The A descriptions state the benefit in terms of relative risk reduction. The B descriptions state it in terms of absolute risk reduction. And the C descriptions give a measure known as number-needed-to-treat, which is especially useful for thinking about the cumulative impact of side effects. If a thousand people have to face side effects for 10 years to benefit one person, a screening test might not be worth it.
In this version of the film, which has gone from editing room to courtroom and back again, the narrative jumps from heated confrontation to corrosive encounter. These are punctuated by lyrical panoramas of the New York skyline that provide breathing room between confrontations, but otherwise are vestigial.
The five-year plan will make sure all county roads -- the major thoroughfares that are not state or U.S. highways -- are rated at least fair.
It's getting easier to find agave nectar, a natural sugar substitute made from the same plant as tequila. Similar to honey, it's passable in most cocktail recipes that call for sugar, with about half the calories (and claimed to have carbs that are more complex, meaning a lower glycemic index). Experiment with about half the amount of sugar called for in a mojito or margarita and adjust to taste.
If you want to find the absolute center in American politics, you could do worse than look at the nation's Catholic vote.
Is Citi's valuation fair? No, it isn't. Citi calculates its 1099 amounts at 2-1/2 cents a mile, supposedly based on an average price of $625 for a domestic coach ticket -- a trip that you can get for 25,000 miles. This valuation is, of course, ridiculously overpriced:
Obviously, the news is often serious business. Death and disease are unavoidable parts of life, and the struggles against strife and poverty have always been with us. I don't think I've ever heard a voice arguing seriously that The Star should avoid a piece of news simply because its subject matter isn't appropriate for young eyes.
This is considerably higher than the NCAA study’s claim that 22.6 percent of athletes smoke marijuana.
"It is regrettable, but we know the people of Misrata understand," said Shamsiddin Abdulmolah, a press liaison with the transitional council who confirmed the rebel deaths. "We know NATO didn't do this on purpose."

It is unclear how close Howard is to deciding whether to ask the grand jury to hand up indictments in the APS case. It also remains to be seen whether racketeering charges will be sought and, if so, who would be the possible targets. But bringing Floyd into the case shows the charges must be under consideration.

Novus was spun off Monsanto in 1991. I had never heard of it. That's not surprising. In the newspaper business, I tend to hear about companies and people who are in trouble of one sort or another. Thriving, growing companies are often below my radar.
Early in the morning, we scrambled down the rocks to see what the current had brought in. Faceted bergs and whale flukes lighted up in the rising sun. When we grew tired of squinting at the distance, we tramped around the island, every step lofted by springy ground cover that invites napping. The only sounds were those of the surf, whales and seabirds.
Also expected back is Demaryius Thomas, who's been sidelined all year. He missed training camp while rehabbing from a torn right Achilles tendon, and the Broncos made the surprising move of keeping him on their 53-man roster rather than placing him on the PUP list to start the season.
The law will give the government new powers to break up companies that threaten the economy, create a new agency to guard consumers in their financial transactions and shine a light into shadow financial markets that escaped the oversight of regulators. The vote came on the same day that Goldman Sachs & Co. agreed to pay a record $550 million to settle charges that it misled buyers of mortgage-related investments.
"There is this thing that exists in the business where actors, once they feel like they've accomplished something, they say, 'I'd really like to take on O'Neill,'" Dennehy said. "He's our Shakespeare."
Fashion giants have scurried in the past year to open stores in China's lesser known cities, such as Hohhot, in Inner Mongolia, and Kunming, in Yunnan province, where few Western retail outlets had ventured before and mom-and-pop shops dominate the landscape.

Peggy continued to be very ill and she died a couple months ago. I talked to my ex, expressing my sympathy for his loss. He told me that over the years she had told him that she hoped we would become friends again. Even though she was already dead my thought was, "That will never happen."
Plum's list also tends to circumvent well-known producers. In sparkling, for example there's a brut from the Jural, a Prosecco from Italy and selections from four smaller Champagne houses: Piere Peters Blanc de Blancs ($88), Ployez Jacquemart Brut ($16 glass/$66 bottle) and Vilmart Rose Cuvee Rubis ($140).
Jon Shenk’s documentary “The Island President” chronicles efforts to save the islands by the charismatic Mohamed Nasheed, who in 2008 became the Muslim nation’s first democratically elected president. He took over from the dictator Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, under whose reign Nasheed was jailed and tortured.
There’s really no better way to take in Newark’s particular aesthetic in one weekend than the Open Doors Studio Tour.
The book also shows why good accounting really matters. It is easy to mock finicky people with green eyeshades who worry about financial footnotes. But reliable numbers are essential if capital is to be allocated properly in our economy. Otherwise good projects starve and foolish ones burn up money.
Said Garcia: “I was all over the place.”
The affluent homes are down by the lake, where boating, cruises and water sports are the main pursuits. The hill overlooking the lake is crowned by downtown Valle de Bravo, where narrow cobbled streets lead to small restaurants, hotels and shops surrounding a traditional zócalo. Yes, Valle has been discovered by the Travel + Leisure contingent, but budget travelers who don't require resort-style pampering will find plenty of affordable places to lay their heads within walking distance of the square. This is where I'm most content.
The Big Ten Conference is not looking at another expansion -- for now.
Clearly fans of both LSU and Alabama will be into tonight's event. But given that the rest of the country remains torn regarding whether or not Alabama deserves to be in the game, does it truly have that championship feel?
​The lines can often be out the door at this simple, spare storefront a block from Penn Station, but not to worry, the guys behind the counter don’t mess around. Subs, sandwiches, and for the adventurous eater, something called the Bigfoot, jammed with every meat and cheese available.

"I weighed both ends of this," Centrowitz said when reached by phone. "It took me a couple months to decide. ... I had to make the decision based on what would keep me progressing, and keep me hungry."
Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne paid Filppula about as high a compliment as there is for a hockey forward, saying, "He looks a little bit like ( Pavel) Datsyuk. He's so smooth with the puck. Great skater. Strong on the puck. Protects the puck really well. He always seems to find his linemates. This year he's been also scoring a lot more. That's a dangerous combination, when you can dish the puck and also score some goals. Whenever Val is on the ice, you have to be aware of him."
The other three members are Tilton Police Chief Robert Cormier, retired Hudson Police Captain William Pease and Portsmouth attorney Steven Roberts, a former district court special justice, will serve on the review committee.
I leap-frog. I have a very short attention span. I don’t think I could do four or five movies in a row, and I don’t think I could go on the road for a year. My Broadway thing, when June comes, I’ll have had seven or eight months there. Then I’ll need to do something else.

Similar stories are playing out across the country as veterans return from Iraq and Afghanistan with psychological and physical wounds. Younger vets may never have lived on their own prior to enlisting in the military, much less managed a mortgage. Disability payments may be their only income, and their job prospects limited.

“It’s a terrible business decision, a terrible planning decision, and, I believe, a terrible health and safety problem,” South Post Road resident Rich Campbell said of the solar project.
The most Elvis-y Christmas song of rock and roll's first decade was not, as it turns out, done by Elvis, but by Brenda Lee. A laid-back rockabilly gem with lead guitar that's pretty much exactly what Elvis guitarist Scotty Moore would play, it even boasts an Elvis-worthy stutter on the line about "mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop." Of course, the sax break places this one closer to a Coasters song, but either way, the end result is timeless.
Needham swam competitively in high school but stopped in college. He didn’t return to the water until he was looking for a way to keep active after injuring a knee while at the University of Oregon School of Law.
Munger's initiative would raise income taxes on nearly all wage earners, with the wealthiest seeing the greatest boost. It is estimated to raise $10 billion to $12 billion annually for 12 years. That money would flow directly to public schools, and lawmakers would have no control over the funds.
Some states, such as Oregon and New York, ban the sale of stop-loss policies to employers with fewer than 50 people enrolled, making self-insurance unappealing.

Jason Cole, Yahoo! Sports: "As the NFL picked the first day of free agency to continue its glorification of wide receivers, the Chicago Bears on Tuesday pulled off what might have been the steal of the market by getting Brandon Marshall for two third-round draft picks. On the flipside, this better mean Peyton Manning is going to Marshall's former team, the Miami Dolphins. Or else. How desperate are teams for wideouts? Josh Morgan, who barely played last season (15 catches for 220 yards and one TD in five games) and has never had one 700-yard year in four seasons, got $12 million over two years. Or how about the fact that a 35-year-old, fading diva who didn't even play last season (Randy Moss, come on down) got a deal with a serious contender (San Francisco) on Monday."
Modern chocolate-making begins with breaking the pods open, fermenting the contents and separating the pulp and beans. The seeds are dried in the sun, washed, roasted, shelled and broken into nibs. Grinding the nibs generates heat that melts the cocoa butter, which makes up about 53 percent of the chocolate liquor, creating a dark, fragrant paste that is kneaded and formed into cakes; part of the cocoa butter is removed to make cocoa powder. Add extra cocoa butter, and you have baking chocolate; sugar or sugar and milk are added to make sweet chocolate.

The margin for error was indeed razor-thin again. The Angels have put the poor starts of the season's first 10 days behind them and are now getting the kind of starting pitching they expected this season. Over the past seven games, Angels starters have an ERA of 2.74 with only Ervin Santana giving up more than three runs in a start.
The Plain Dealer recently ran two pieces questioning both the legality and the wisdom of federally prosecuting local corruption cases as well as hate crimes. An op-ed posited that federal prosecutors relied on creative legal gymnastics to bring the Cuyahoga County corruption case under a law that does not really fit ("Feds overreach with fraud charges," March 16). A news story ("Amish case hinges on hate law, commerce," Monday) implied that the pending hate crimes prosecution of a group who allegedly planned and carried out numerous attacks on Amish people based on the victims' religion rests solely on where a pair of scissors was made.

Years, in this case, is relative. Sweatt's racing career goes back only a few years. The 15-year-old Edwardsville sophomore grew up in a running family, but racing still is a fairly new for the youngest of four Sweatts to run for the Tigers.
What Dean Johnson and Tysie McDowell-Ray, the co-founders of Crossroads Academy, have in mind is a school for students from families of all incomes and ethnic backgrounds who want to provide their children with an education that has an urban edge.

Andre Miller had 16 points, 11 assists, six rebounds and about 20 pump fakes on the night. His pump fake under the basket got Serge Ibaka airborne with 18.4 seconds left, allowing Miller to score a layup to give the Blazers a 100-98 lead.
"There's always going to be pressure in major league baseball; there's no way we're going to be able to get away from that," manager Ron Gardenhire said. "He has to be able to handle those things. Taking a step back sometimes is a really good thing. We'll see how he does."
The showdown happened at the North Jersey Country Club, where the gals were attending a fashion show put on Kim DePaola of Posche. Jacqueline and Teresa were at Kim D.'s table, while Danielle accompanied Kim Granatell. As Danielle was leaving, Teresa positioned herself in the lobby and tried to engage, nay incite Danielle into a confrontation. Danielle resisted at first, but Teresa was working overtime to turn it into Table Flip 2.0. And speaking of the table flip, Teresa was trying to convince Danielle that really, she's all sweetness and light, and that Danielle turned her into a furniture-toppling hellion, honey. When Danielle coolly tell her not to call her honey, Teresa snaps and calls her a bitch.
Jones noted that some of the slogans yelled by anti-fur activists, such as "Thousands of animals died in pain; Horst Grimm is to blame," clearly fall within the bounds of legal political protest. At the same time, the pattern of profane language fired at point-blank range crosses a legal boundary, Jones said.

Team doctors ruled out the possibility that Rattie sustained a concussion when he was driven head-first into the boards by Kamloops J.C. Lipon at about the 12-minute mark of Wednesday’s first period.

The Syrian revolution is going to spiral into something awful. The longer it lasts, the more people die and the greater the chance of it spilling across borders.

As you might imagine, Lemmy’s Krakatoa Surprise gave Seabury’s recipe tester pause, but, as Seabury explained to the pro, "It’s Lemmy, so he can do whatever he wants."

Earlier studies are pretty convincing that structural changes in the St. Clair River have partially contributed to the lower Michigan-Huron water level. But the Georgian Bay area also has been dealt a geologic problem, in that its land mass is slowly rising -- a long-term rebound from the glaciers that once covered the land. There are no solutions for that, and it does not pay to compensate for it if the fix leads to flooding Chicago.

Van Riemsdyk was not credited with the overtime goal, though it was reviewed a few times by the official scorers, since it seemed to change direction before clearing Brodeur's unguarded five-hole.

Desserts were also a surprise - for their price, if nothing else. I still can't figure out why the yogurt was $12. Four rounds of olive oil cake, each a little bigger than a quarter, were interspersed with little rosettes of thick Greek yogurt, honey and cubes of gelee.

For the next decade, American politics will turn on this truth: Slowing the growth of the entitlement state is absolutely necessary and intensely unpopular.

"Gov. Romney's predictions of a living dead? We have now living proof: a million jobs saved, 200,000 new jobs created," Biden said, to cheers. With Romney trying to sell himself as a better steward of the economy than Obama, his demonstrably wrong conclusions about the bailouts are grist for the Obama attack mill (the other GOP presidential contenders also opposed the bailouts, but the Obama campaign is focusing its criticisms on Romney). In 2008, Romney wrote an op-ed for the New York Times that began, "If General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye." Not only has the industry failed to vanish, but GM has reported record profits and regained its crown as the world's biggest automaker.

Why should the United States keep forces in Afghanistan while withdrawing them from Iraq? Some argue, cogently, that if the greatest threat to U.S. national security comes from terrorist havens in failed states, then we have more to fear from a failed Iraq, with its huge population, strategic location and oil wealth, than from a failed Afghanistan, an impoverished backwater. If Al Qaeda were to dominate Iraq, it would pose a terrible security threat to the West -- but that outcome appears unlikely. Sunni tribal leaders are cooperating with U.S. forces to fight the foreign Al Qaeda; Shiites have been the primary victims of its barbaric attacks. The United States does have an interest in a stable Iraq, but its troops cannot impose peace without a committed Iraqi partner.

Because Infiniti is Nissan's luxury nameplate, the JX will share a platform with Nissan's upcoming 2013 Pathfinder SUV. The size of the JX puts it above Infiniti's sporty FX crossover and below its elephantine and stupendously ugly full-size SUV, the QX.

The bulk of the job cuts proposed in the mayor's new $7.2-billion budget would affect civilian employees at the Los Angeles Police Department, where 159 clerks, secretaries and other administrators would be put out of work.

Oregon will lose senior left tackle Darrion Weems and right guard Mark Asper, two anchors of the 2011 Oregon line. Add them to the losses of C.E. Kaiser, Jordan Holmes and Bo Thran from the 2010 team and that’s quite the loss of talent over a two-year stretch.

Judging by this research, high rates of joblessness among working-class and poor men are likely to harm the quality and stability of married life among lower-income couples over the long term, as men's economic contributions to their families become more marginal in working-class communities. Some men may embrace their new role at home and take up more child care and housework. But job loss and instability can be a big blow to a man's sense of self-worth, can undercut his wife's faith in him and cause considerable financial stress for the couple. Men's unemployment can lead to a vicious cycle of conflict, recrimination and withdrawal that ends in divorce.
Then she explained that the garlic for the pomodoro sauce had to be sliced. I didn't know why until I tasted her pomodoro sauce. It blew me away.

Some people, not familiar with the team, claim there's no accountability in the Royals' organization. I pointed out that Bob McClure might disagree  but the point was made even better by Doug Sisson. I told him I was there in spring training, I sat and watched drills for two weeks and I know he told these guys the right things to do on the base paths. Doug said that didn't make any difference. He wasn't going to put the blame on a player. Even if he told them what to do and they ignored those instructions five pitches later, it's his fault. He has to make them understand and if they don't there's something wrong with the instruction.
