I have no idea why this cat complains so much. He lives a life of being fed and pampered, but no, that is just somehow not enough. He wants more and he makes it known. If he had it his way…either me or my daughter would be permanently in place to feed and love him all day long. Then I think he would be truly content, though I really think the little lion would still find something to complain about.

The story flips between two perspectives which are both uniquely idiosyncratic and well developed in their own right. The stars are airship captain and escaped slave Croggon Hainey and former confederate spy and patriot Maria "Belle" Boyd. Both are something of a living legend or menace in this world depending on what side of the fence your are viewing from. Neither take crap from anyone.

The girls hailed from Marion, Iowa. They started performing to raise funds so that they could attend the Chicago World’s Fair in 1893. An enterprising and cynical genius spotted them and realized he could make an act out of it. As such, it was way ahead of its time. It was another 90 years, for example, before David Letterman would present Larry “Bud” Melman. The Cherry Sisters began to be booked throughout the mid-west. Oscar Hammerstein, having read about them in reviews like the one above quoted, brought them to the Victoria, knowing that a sophisticated and, well, cruel New York audience would especially relish this sort of entertainment.

Last night I sat outside, enjoying the mild weather, and ordered Sizzling Chicken Fajitas, then settled in to read a book I picked up from the Houston Library. In less an 5 minutes my dinner arrived! Now, granted, they weren’t very busy when I got there, but I was really surprised at just how fast my dinner was served.
The walk was not an arduous one, with no hills to climb and no stiles to clamber over. Fearing we would arrive at the pub ahead of opening time, Dick was forced to add an extra loop to our route in order to ensure we arrived bang on midday. As the sun was shining and it was quite warm when sheltered from the wind, most of us opted to sit outside on the patio at the rear of the pub, This was also conveniently sited for the barn, just the other side of the car park, where the majority of the festival beers were to be found. Payment for the beers was by means of tokens, with all beers priced at £3.00 a pint; £1.50 per half. The pub itself had Harvey's Best, and Taylors Landlord on sale, alongside Kent Brewery Cobnut. I started though with Spring Top 4.0%, a well-hopped, pale bitter from Ed's excellent Old Dairy Brewery, down at Rolvenden. Then, nipping into the pub to order my food, I opted for a glass of the aforementioned Cobnut. Described, quite correctly, as a "ruby ale" this 4.2% offering was perhaps not the best introduction to Kent Brewery beers, but then I have never been much of a fan of this style of beer. Ruby Ales tend to be synonymous with Irish "Red Ales" and always seem to me to have an overdose of crystal malt and roasted barley. This one was no exception, although it was probably amongst the more drinkable examples.

If they're not filtered out, hops will often cloud a beer, and so it was promising to find a murky golden-orange beer pour from the bottle. I expect the beer has some aroma at warmer temperatures, but I could detect but a hint of citrus in my refrigerator-temperature bottle.
Humans who want to pet their primate cousins should try their luck with orang-utans rather than gorillas or chimps. Scientists have discovered that they and humans share genetic traits which other primates don’t have. Presumably these include red hair and sexual perversion. Do you remember Clyde, the man-friendly orang-utan who starred alongside Clint Eastwood in Every Which Way But Loose? That saucy ape was always sticking his paw in places it didn’t belong. And he lived with Clint’s mother too. There is no way an orang-utan would shack up with an elderly woman unless something devilishly kinky was going on.
That stack of books at the top are books that talk about spindling, from my shelves -- some purchased new, some second-hand, some searched for high-and-low to buy at a reasonable price. They appear in Productive Spindling, in the Spindler's Bibliography -- also available here on Ask The Bellwether. Someday my weaving may have a similar focus and depth on a particular topic, right now it's still pretty wide-ranging though I see a definite interest in twills developing (happy grin).

The mosque was a huge red stone complex set on a rise overlooking the Red Fort and the streets below. It is the largest in India and can hold 25,000 worshipers! In order to enter the mosque all foreign women had to wear a long colourful moo-moo.

Those are virtual locks for completion in the next six months, and are on the front burners, along with the blognovel Fallen Earring. That's going to be appearing on my website proper after nanowrimo. I've decided to do a complete rewrite, from scratch, and am doing it as my nanonovel. As soon as I can apply a decent edit, I'm going to put it up in sections. "It" being the version I'm happier with afterward. I'd like to put that novel to bed and get on with the next one in the series, Vermilion Dawn, which I've decided not to do for Nano this year.

Pad the resume for college applications, get a first look at the gossip column, spend some time ogling the paper’s brooding bad-boy editor, Chase Erikson.

Electrocuted while Tweeting. Now, in addition to developing a reputation as HHH’s resident body finder, I’m stuck trying to prove that Sydney’s death wasn’t suicide.

Usenet is a "worldwide distributed internet discussion system". In NewsBin 1 (Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and others v Newzbin Ltd [2010] EWHC 608 (Ch)) Fox, together with other film makers and distributors, sued NewzBin, "a British Usenet indexing website notable for its introduction of new technologies and search techniques that aid users by facilitating access to content on Usenet" (per Wikipedia), for copyright infringement. According to the claimants, NewzBin was focused on piracy in that it located and categorised unlawful copies of films and then (i) displayed the titles of these copies in its indices, (ii) provided a facility for its users to search for particular unlawful copies, (iii) displayed their search results and (iv) provided a simple one-click mechanism for users to acquire the unlawful copies of their choice.
The truth is that everyone is a theologian. The title is not reserved for the religious elite. Everyone has an idea about God, even atheist. The problem is that most people have a shallow, silly, or down-right wrong impression of who God actually is. When we say we’re not a theologian, what we’re really saying is that we already know enough about God and we’re not interested in learning anything more. At least not as a result of our own study.

Hylan battled the train companies for most of his two terms. He was re-elected in 1921 by effectively thwarting the fare increase and creating a transit commission to refigure a transportation system under city control. By the end Hylan had effectively retooled New York's transportation industry by creating his own city-run operation, christening the new Independent Subway System (ISS), in his last year of office, on March 14, 1925.

I love new things and would very much enjoy shopping, if I had the money to purchase what I want.

It's uncanny. They look exactly like Rosie! So now I have to read up on harriers. The only thing I know about harriers is that they look a lot like beagles, only bigger.

It prefers life in a pack with people or dogs or both."
Once again, enough about me, this is about you . . . Okay, maybe a little bit me too, but I’m going to start with a supposition: Without taking full responsibility for the harm that one has done to another, just as it clouds one’s connection to something bigger if one cannot find a way to let go of the pain caused by someone else, so too it clouds one’s connection to the divine if they lie to themselves about the pain they have caused others, and do not try to correct the problem existent in one’s self that allowed them to hurt someone else.

We still do not know the cause of Sawyer’s death. His heart just stopped. He is currently in a study at the Mayo Clinic for Long QT. His autopsy did not determine that it was SIDS.

However, I hope that his death will help to provide the research which could prevent other children from dying.

David Cameron of course doe snot deserve any type of commendation for the revelation that, as many thought, the Conservative party sells gongs. This ‘revelation’ does nothing for his claims that 2012 will be Britains year because we are all going to “go for it” together. Apart from taking action on public services and social issues, which does seem rather vague, he offered no details as to how we might achieve this together.
And so, from the dark headiness of the spice alleys we re-emerged into the bright sunshine and the larger streets and caught a water taxi across the Creek to the oldest part of town beyond. The water was bustling with small vessels and on the short journey across we spotted a traditional looking restaurant with large wooden balcony overlooking the watery scene, so this was where we headed once we'd disembarked. A relaxed lunch ensued with a large selection of mezze, salads and breads washed down by an avocado smoothie (no alcohol here).

Amber- In December 2008, unbeknownst to each other, we were both reading the same business book at the same time (The Boss of You written by Vancouver web designers Lauren Bacon and Emira Mears), with the other in mind as the perfect business partner. We met for coffee, each with the ulterior motive of proposing a partnership. Our conversation went a little something like this…
“Why, you say?” The officer chuckled unpleasantly and shook her head. “Who knows? I would say that the Empress is just a kind-hearted soul, but that certainly doesn’t mesh with anything I’ve ever heard about her. My guess is she figures you and your pals have been beaten down so bad that you’re not gonna try anything ever again.” She chuckled a little more, and then her expression turned to stone. “Just be happy that the decision wasn’t up to me. My parents and my little brother died in the war. If it were my choice, you and your buddies would have been thrown out of the airlock as soon as you got on board.” With that, she left and the door slid shut behind her.

Late tonight, Chris and I will eat rice and beans yet again. Nonetheless, like last year, in a lovely coincidence, I’ll spend Thanksgiving with Native Americans – Amerindians, as we say in South America. I’ll still be giving thanks for the bounty of the rainy season – our ‘summer’ – as ground provisions, bananas, and fruits are currently plentiful. And, as a personal exercise, I decided to make an articulated effort at ‘giving thanks’. So, here are the things I am thankful for this year:

How to get rid of the lice environment only lead to additional anger and frustration. But over time these types of treatment have become increasingly less effective as lice have assembled up a resistance to many of the constituents they are manufactured of. Nits are white creamy colored, regarding the size of a pinhead and are mostly over 2 to 3 cm in the hair shaft. In order to totally clear away every the eggs demands a careful combination of minutes and methodical examination of the hair and scalp while combing your hair with a fine comb lice right.

Based on a novel by prolific author Elspeth Huxley, Flame Trees documents the difficulties of an immigrant family adapting to a harsh African region, albeit one controlled by the British Empire. The dramatic struggles and hard-ships of the occupying population should be taken with a grain of salt and especially so in the film version. Much of the drama comes from what people today call First World Problems. Elspeth Huxley, taking from her own experiences growing up in Thika (pronounced Tee-ka), documented the negative effects of colonialism caused by various invading or meddling foreign countries. Perhaps given perceived audience sensibilities and time constraints the horrible social inequalities between cultures is somewhat thin, something the book explored in richer detail.

Now, some people have said Obama looks like he’s trying to figure out what he’s gonna wear on the golf course later. But, no. Obama has this habit of looking up and looking up above everyone and Bush is bowing his head. Obama’s eyes are closed looking up. That’s quite striking. I think it’s quite, quite telling.

The Commonwealth appears to be arguing that this common understanding of the nature and purpose of a trade mark is simply wrong. According to the Commonwealth argument, the only exclusive “right” a trade mark confers is the right to prevent others from using it, and therefore the fact that the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011 (Cth) effectively prohibits any meaningful use at all of the tobacco companies’ trade marks on or about their products and packaging is of no constitutional significance whatever.

When I was growing up, I stayed with my grandparents a week or two every summer. They lived on a street that dead-ended into some railroad tracks. I would often awaken several times on my first night as the box cars rumbled by or when an engineer blew the train whistle. By the end of my visit, however, I had grown so accustomed to the noise that I could sleep straight through the night without interruption. I had tuned out the sounds.

As great as the concept of the show was and everything else I mentioned before about what made 24 so special, perhaps what has given the show its heart is Kiefer Sutherland's portrayal of Jack Bauer.
It is unclear whether or not HSBC notified the authorities as they closed the account. However, they then proceeded authorise the release of the contents of the account. which came to the enormous sum of SG$13.4million and US$7.19 million.

To paraphrase a song lyric, “Everything old is news again.” Here I’ve been sitting on some fine performance footage of The SteelDrivers that I recorded last summer, when along comes an announcement at Christmastime: Mike Henderson, the group’s mandolin and steel guitar player, is decamping. How much you care about this development no doubt depends on how you feel about The SteelDrivers in general. For any of you fence-sitters, have a look and a listen as the group tears through “Cry No Mississippi,” a foot-stompin’ anthem at the 2011 Grey Fox Bluegrass Festival:
So, what you want to look for is a TRADING guru, who also happens to teach. Those are hard to find, but with a little digging, you can discover them. The key is to find someone with independently documented success, not a self proclaimed guru. For instance, hedge funds and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) have documented track records, there are worldwide trading contests with verified results, and independent trade auditing websites that rank the best traders.
Digital and traditional each held their own ground for a few years. Traditional was the lead dog, and digital was just there to translate (read: resize) the creative and ideas from TV and print into acceptable formats for the web. Digital was seen as the extension of something like direct mail, not broadcast. In some ways, this is a correct view, and in others, it's just wrong.
A cappella takes a tremendous amount of skill, which I could never reach despite years of voice lessons and choirs. You must possess a flawless ear: so you can pick up your own part in an arrangement and also so you can tune out the seven singers around you who are all blaring different things. No divas, please--you must be able to blend. Beatboxing helps. It's intense.

Everyone has to go through valleys of loss sometime. That’s just a fact of life. Some fight it, try to go around the valley, or think they can avoid it. They may even suppress their grief, their loss, thinking they can keep it away.

Thankfully the storm was short-lived, and the only damage we sustained was the damaged rack of solar panels on the roof hitting our water tank and cracking one panel. Our neighbors and co-workers, the Williams, lost their car when a huge branch crushed it. Of course there were leaves and branches everywhere, but it was NOTHING compared to the five who lost their lives and the damage sustained by some in the tent cities who literally lost everything…..again. Yet, when we drove to the airport to pick up Todd the very next day most of the tents we saw already had their tarps or other covering lashed back on snugly.

Bartee was originally scheduled to be executed on February 28, 2012, even though DNA evidence collected at the crime scene had not been tested as ordered on at least two occasions by District Judge Mary Román. He received a reprieve on February 23, 2012 when Judge Román withdrew the execution warrant so that additional DNA testing could be conducted on strands of hair found in the hands of the victim, David Cook. She also ordered the forensic lab to provide a detailed and comprehensive report to the court with an analysis of the results. Yet, before the testing occurred, Judge Román inexplicably set another execution date, for May 2, 2012.

I've had my eye open for a new job for a long time and finally one came along that was too good to be true (financially) and I got it! I put in my notice at my current job yesterday. I will start the new job on May 24, working for a church as an administrative assistant. I WILL BE MAKING ENOUGH MONEY TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND START A SAVINGS ACCOUNT!
Beer in the glass.
Where will you be flying in to? I will try to meet you at the airport in order to help reduce the amount of time I have to wait to get my money. Seeing as I’ll have enough money to do so, I’ll hire a local celebrity (likely the man who pays a king eating meat off the bone in the local theater) to drive us. Just try not to talk to him too often. He’s a Hyperpolysyllabicsesquipedalianist and I swear he does it just to show off sometimes. What a geekburger with cheese. But we can have him drive us to Punxsutawney, PA where I heard they have the ultimate fist pump party down on Beaver Creek. The last time I went to a good fist pumping party, I ended up getting punched right in the jaw and it broke in two different places. Talk about your jaw dropping to the floor. It took 4 years of reconstructive surgery to get everything back to normal.
A growl came from somewhere deep inside him. My body ignited before his mouth even touched mine. When he pulled back, I gasped at the wicked smile playing on his lips. “Only you, Eri.”
The fall was painful. He sprawled on the grass, wondering if he had twisted his ankle. He was reassured when he got to his feet. His ankle hurt, but it functioned. Limping only slightly, he traversed the lawn, stepped over a low iron railing, and with increasing ease walked east away from the Joliet courthouse.

Arguably the most resourceful of all of the Death Angels’ (in this case, Jesse Lee Cooks, Larry Green, and Anthony Cornelius Harris’) intended victims were the first whom they targeted on October 20, 1973 — Michele Denise Carrasco, and Marie and Frank Stewart. When the Death Angels attempted to kidnap them with a van, in order to murder them, all three ran away. Plucky Michele Denise Carrasco was but 11 years old, Marie Stewart was 12, and Frank was 15.

As I said on a previous post, If you already have an online business then it’s a must that you start here. The FREE training alone is worth the time spent. I have never seen a group so dedicated and unbiased as this one. Regardless of what your primary company is, they are here to help. Are you sick of chasing around your friends and family? Are you sick of buying leads that have been circulated to 20 other people who are out there promoting their company? Wouldn’t you like to have your own lead source?

I wrote yesterday about a potential job that I've been working to get over the last month and a half. It's really hard to get into this place and it would be such a blessing for our family (hello! better benefits means we get to have another baby!!!) for me to go back to work, especially here, especially doing something I love.

This is what happened with today's recipe. I was happily chatting away on an online forum about saffron. I don't use saffron much. I don't make paella (too much fish!) so the only dish I use saffron in is risotto milanese. I considered what else I could make with saffron, but I kept thinking about how much I really like my risotto milanese.
Pretty much everybody thinks Rupert Murdoch isn’t fit to run a media company. And, hell, we know that. But when Parliament thinks Rupert Murdoch isn’t fit to run a media company, well, that could have real-life, tangible, bottom-line consequences. Because the UK doesn’t let just any old thieving, lying, wiretapping raper of the hopes of the parents of kidnapped children own a media company the way the U.S. does. No, News Corp. could have to actually divest itself of its 40% share of BSkyB. Ouch.

Nora Allison sees the coldness in the eyes of her fiancee when he slaps his young son, recognizes the man for what he is and calls of the wedding. This is followed by receiving threats by mail and being roped by the ex-wife of her ex-fiancee in the custody battle of their son. This bimbette is stupid enough to be framed in a murder case. Enter the suave Perry Mason with his intelligent secretary Della Street and the dependable sleuth Paul Drake – the real culprits are caught in court, the police are made to look stupid and the client goes scot-free.

Don't worry about the title, and whether it's working or final or whatever. Publishers have final say in the title of books and at least half the books I've sold have undergone title changes. In other words, don't get too attached to the "perfect title"--just like washing your car is a sure fire way to make it rain, loving your title too much means it's Gone In 60 Seconds.
Hmm... Yes. I have to admit, I don't get the "more" or the "sea", but perhaps in comparison to normal German beers, there is a "sea change" here. But please, lets not fracture the already apparently infinitesimally divided "beer style" list by creating a "German DIPA"!

Before moving on with the details of our second day in Lima, I must give my compliments to the O’Ryans. One of the responsibilities of being a Work Sponsor is that they came to our house before we arrived and prepared the home with various items so that we would not enter a completely empty abode. Before our shopping adventure with the O’Ryans yesterday, we were able to enjoy a breakfast of eggs and cereal with the food and kitchen equipment they brought in. I give my profound thanks to the O’Ryans for making us feel welcome.

This is only a 170 mile drive but it took us over 4 hours because at least half of our route was along two-lane country roads. It was a very pretty drive... and I now understand why Montana is often referred to as Big Sky Country. Its hard to put into words, but as imposing as the countryside is, the sky dominates with amazing cloud formations and a gradiated azure that is simply beautiful. I was fascinated by that Montana sky but, sadly, we have no photos that even come close to "representing".

Questions can be asked in humility and with a soft heart, by His grace He may choose to give us Revelation through His Holy Spirit. One thing I pray I will always steer clear of is questioning God Himself. God is God and I am man, I can only see apart of the picture He is painting. I pray I always remember when I do not have understanding, who I am and who He is.

A couple of months ago, I posted on my complaint that Time Magazine thinks the American public doesn't care about world issues (and may well be right). This week Time garnered a lot of attention when it released a cover of a mother breast feeding her 4 year old child. The cover is certainly startling, but I was more interested in how it compared to the covers of the European, Asian, and South Pacific versions of the magazine.
Feeling relieved and delighted today as we heard that Katie has been given a place at the school we all wanted her to go to. It is our catchment school but I'm now hearing of children in our area not getting into their catchment schools so we are doubly pleased (although when did my little girl get big enough for Big School?).

She and I both agree that we don’t hate this. Perhaps we just can’t pull it off. I do recall Lou wearing something similar years ago when we ventured to Silverado, Portland’s dick flopping male strip club. Pretty sure she was wearing a negligee (speaking of which, I had no idea that’s how you spelled that, it looks wrong and weird), some cut offs and stockings attached to the negligee. I had on a leopard print bustier and cowboy boots. Obviously we win at life. Why the fuck don’t we have pictures of that??
My whole life I’ve been on the path to find the person I love the most – the person I could spend my life with.

If you’re not really into the person, the relationship is dead almost immediately.”

Up until the end of Apartheid 1994, Barnard was able to bask in the glory alone. Yet in the new democratic South Africa, the traumatic past was reopened from various sides and prominent events and achievements came under renewed scrutiny. Suddenly the name Hamilton Naki popped up in connection with the operation. National and international media latched onto the story of Naki, who fit the bill perfectly as an example of an unsung hero. Naki, moreover, gave us an entirely new version of the historic transplant operation. He claimed to have been present in the operating theatre. Barnard had allowed this, Naki explained, under the condition that he not tell a soul.

There’s one tree especially that I keep noticing for some reason. It draws me toward it every time I pass by it on the road leading northward to our street. It’s an ordinary tree, and I have no cause to notice it. It’s not standing alone, nor is it outwardly unique. It’s just a wide-spreading maple at the top of a small hill near the road. Regardless, something about it has caught my eye repeatedly for well over a week now.
I bake it up, slice it into slices, then put it back together with pieces of parchment paper between the slices and then I freeze it in an airtight plastic container. That way all I have to do is to grab out as many slices as I am wanting to serve and the rest stays safe in the freezer ready to indulge in at another time.

At work we sell a lot of stuff plastered with brand names - the biggest culprit for this is Ben 10. His face appears on everything from water guns to Ben 10's Fine Bone China Tea Set. The latter isn't true but there's a lot of shite that doesn't really need his face on it, like laundry pop-up bags because that's what all kids like to do. I know as a kid the most fun I had wasn't exploring Dura Den or playing SNES games but in fact was putting clothes into my very own Animals Of Farthing Wood laundry pop-up bag.
The new recipe goes about it differently: you melt and slightly cool the chocolate, then beat it together with softened butter. (If you don't cool the chocolate a bit, it'll melt the butter.) Then you add the vanilla, a little cocoa powder (which amps up the chocolate flavors), and the powdered sugar. At this point, it's thick, dry, and crumbly, and you beat in about a third of a cup of buttermilk - a little more, if needed. For some reason, by inverting the process, you end up with a perfectly spreadable, lightened frosting that's thick enough to hold its shape when piped. And I like the hint of tang from the buttermilk. It's not quite enough to call attention to itself, but it's just enough to cut down on the sweetness of the chocolate. For what it's worth, the original recipe called for semi-sweet chocolate, but with five cups of powdered sugar, I didn't think the extra sugar in the chocolate was needed, so I used unsweetened.

In a very large bowl with a large and wide wooden spoon, cream butter and sugar until smooth and fluffy as frosting. Beat in vanilla extract. Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl until spices are well blended. Add 1/4 dry ingredients into butter mixture, beating and working it in until it is full incorporated and smooth. Continue this process 3 more times. You will find that the dough will be very stiff and harder to work by the last addition, but patience and extra elbow grease will get it to the right consistency. The dough will ultimately be very moist and pliable, working up easily into a ball.

Although my parents have had a big impact on my savoring skills, having CF has no doubt taught me to do the same. After being in the hospital for 2 HUGE snow storms, and never getting to see the 3 feet of snow on the ground, snow is something that I savor. I'll walk extra slowly to admire the way it flutters to the ground, I'll take a minute to be in awe of its sheer volume after a blizzard. I'll get all excited to feel the way my skis glide through the powder after a snowy day. Where snow is something that just slows down and inconveniences the every day life of New Englanders, for me, it's something special.

It’s true that there are limits to how much control you can exert over your employees’ social media activity. You can block access on their work computers, but they can still use their smartphones while sitting at their desks. And of course you can’t really control what employees tweet or blog about your company outside of work. That being said, by adopting, disseminating and enforcing a comprehensive social media policy, you let employees know what the rules are and what is expected of them. That gives them—and your organization—the opportunity to make social media a net plus rather than a potential source of disaster.

18. Cinderella Man (Russell Crowe) – Combination of underdog plus romance equals perfection.
When we returned I had to make a start on another cake. I was asked to make it for a friends husband for his 50th, this one I was even being paid for. I was very nervous that I was getting payment, so I added alot of extra pressure on myself to make sure it was perfect. It was a 'travel' themed party so I thought what better than to do a suitcase. I decorated it with 'flag/stickers' of places he had been and lived, and added a special touch with a shirt he used to wear apparently ALL the time whilst travelling. Sometimes I really am not that confident of the things I make & create regardless of any praise, but I dont think this turned out too badly, do you?
I told hubby that all of his clothes needed to fit either in his drawers or the closet. He agrees and is trying to "figure it out". I also gently reminded him of my deadline and how I have Tuesday night blocked out to decorate and put the finishing touches on the room.

Honestly, I don’t remember too much about that event in the life of our family, but I do recall getting a huge package that year under the tree. Have you ever had a big package? I can only imagine my eyes as a nine year old, unwrapping a three foot tall very fashionable Go Go girl doll. It seemed so extravagant.

This year my Lenten journey has been different from any year that I can recall. It’s not just because I’m living in England (although that has something to do with it); it’s that I’ve made a conscious effort to find God in all things – even the shitty stuff.
It all started here, on Easter. It was a good day. Family, food, fun traditions, and best of all, remembering the greatest thing ever: being reconciled to God.
Later today, Andy Grammer will be in the Atrium for an interview on the hospital's radio station. And later still, "Sam" and "Emily" from Twilight: Breaking Dawn will also be here - pretty exciting stuff! I am truly impressed by how many stars are willing to put in a free visit to a children's hospital when they are in town. Selena Gomez has been here twice, apparently.
W.A. Bonger, in his detailed 1943 comparative study Race and Crime, claims to be unable to find elevated criminal activity in Chinese populations in North America. On the contrary, N.S. Hayner in 1937 reports that:

President Obama has his sights set on raising $1 billion for his reelection campaign. Raising that money won’t be easy. But if you can hand out other people’s money to friends, it must get a whole lot easier. This crony capitalism and government waste is at the heart of our economic problems. It will destroy us if we don’t root it out. It’s not just a Democrat problem or a Republican problem. It’s a problem of our permanent political class. This won’t stop until “we the people” say enough is enough, and we retire the permanent political class that votes for this.
Researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota have done a retrospective study on children who had been exposed to anesthesia at an early age. They found that for those children who were given anesthetics two or more times before the age of three, their risk of developing ADHD more than doubled.
I wont say it's like the good old days, as things have defiantly changed since the floods but for me the change has been for the better and I cant wait to see how things develop further. On that note this will be my last blog entry for the next week or so as I head on leave as of today, yippee! I do however have the great news that Chad will be taking over after returning from his two month sabbatical. He is not returning straight to drive but I'm sure he will keep you posted of the sightings and a recount of the days adventures until he comes onto drive in the next couple of days. I want to thank you for all the support and comments over the past
I did indeed make a card in honor of World Card Making Day. That's it, over on the left. I think its pretty. Not only did I make this card for a cyber friend, but I wanted to enter it in a couple of challenges. Being the procrastinator that I am, I didn't get it entered into any of them. I enjoyed making the card, I measured, printed, colored, cut, pasted and stamped. A labor of love.

For a series that focused on the “fake” aspects of life, it certainly captured being a “fake” of it’s prequel. It’s somewhat interesting how the same group of characters can feel so different in another series. I’m not a huge fan of Shaft and their productions, but I felt Bakemonogatari had an interesting story behind it and enjoyed it in 2009-2010. Unfortunately, the focus on the intimacy between Koyomi and his sisters couldn’t capture that same enjoyment. The final two episodes were amazingly strong and felt like they were part of the original story, but everything else was relatively weak.
Later on a couple of officers hand over several brown paper evidence bags containing clothes taken from the body of a dead man. His neighbour had rung complaining about a smell coming from his flat and the officers found him dead on his kitchen floor. The attending doctor was happy that it was natural causes, nothing suspicious so the system took over and everything was bagged and tagged.
Even though I don't have anything to blame it on, I've been feeling gritchy, so maybe you can imagine my delight when I walked downtown to the bank and the post office and, standing in line at the latter, looked out the front window and saw this:

In this article, Prof. Desiraju laments at the slow progress of Indian science; on how India has not produced a single Nobel laureate since C. V. Raman, on how there have been no radical breakthroughs to ‘rival the telephone’ and how India lacks any postdoctoral system worth its name. He reasons that lack of funding is only one of the problems and definitely not the core problem facing Indian science. The core problems according to Prof. Desiraju are a feudal mindset, lack of dissent and lack of institutional autonomy.

The noblest calling in the world is motherhood. True motherhood is the most beautiful of all arts, the greatest of all professions. She who can paint a masterpiece, or who can write a book that will influence millions, deserve the plaudits and admiration of mankind; but she who rears successfully a family of healthy, beautiful sons and daughters whose immortal souls will exert influence throughout the ages long after paintings shall have faded, and books and statues shall have decayed or been destroyed, deserves the highest honor that man can give, and the choicest blessings of God. ― David O.

We've come for the bar menu of course, and are dismayed to find that even at 6pm, every table is taken. There's no waiting list, a waitress tells us, so we're forced to hover around the dining area until we eventually pounce on a departing table. You can make reservations for tables if you call in advance - we're definitely doing that the next time we visit.
The times are huge for our women. Personal bests for Johnson, Uceny and Beckwith. Johnson’s mark moves her into the all time top 10 American women at #9. Most importantly it continues the improvement US women have been showing in the middle distances over the past two seasons. It’s a big race for Johnson who has shown talent in the past but just hasn’t been able to break through. Perhaps this will be her race. Uceny has been improving like crazy in both the 800/1500 this season, and looks ready to step up and be a major competitor.

I feel like the grocery dollar amount is what I would expect. In fact, I think I expected it to be higher considering the amount of time I spend at the grocery store! However, I think this figure can be lower. I do the bulk of my grocery shopping at Target (one stop shopping, lol! plus now I get 5% off my purchases so it's a done deal!) but it's easy to get drawn into buying non-necessities while there (such as clothing for the girls...or me...maybe shoes....or props....shall I go on? lol). If I stick to the "buy only what's on the list" method, I can bring this cost down by at least hundred or so.

The baby has a visit scheduled with her mom tomorrow. The worker is meeting the mom before the visit to go through the letter from the dermatologist and do her best to ascertain whether or not the mom has completed everything she needs to do. The worker is pretty no-nonsense about these things and the mom's not a great liar, so I'm not-so-secretly hoping the worker doesn't let her have the visit. If she does have the visit and the baby gets infected AGAIN, it looks really bad for the mom in court, so hopefully the worker can get that through to her.

Back in the mists of time a British Pro Cyclist was as rare as bees knees - however there have been some famous names that have come from these isles. (Please note I’m going to include Ireland throughout this blog - this is because I don’t understand politics and so (in my head) they count). Mention the names; Tom Simpson, Sean Kelly, Robert Millar, Sean Yates, Chris Boardman or Stephen Roche, and most cycling fans will know who they are. However these big names were few and far between.

Schools have long lists of things everyone "needs to know." They spend a lot of time teaching about the things on the list. They certainly do not succeed in teaching everyone all of these things. Think about the process of teaching a concept in school. Teacher spends a certain number of hours presenting and explaining concept. Teacher assigns homework for students to practice concept. When teacher feels like she has explained enough, teacher tests students on concept. Some students do well on test. Others fail. Some clearly still do not understand concept. Teacher moves on to next concept.

As a way of doing things, this is not exactly rocket science and has been around for a long time. However, in the past this approach has generally been Plan B, when the preferred option of growing, protecting and monopolising one's own innovation needs to the point of self-sufficiency could not be achieved. The importance of Chesburgh's contribution is in the paradigm shift in corporate thinking: open innovation is portrayed as Plan A, the ideal option which both reduces R&D costs and focuses them more efficiently, which leads to improved quality and more consumer choice, and which is not merely open in the inward-outward sense but which encourages greater transparency of licensed technology itself.
In terms of what I think, I don't mind admitting that I love the interior of the Bath Hotel so much that I don't even want the colours to change! I know this seems a little weird, but its important to appreciate just how rare a survival the pub is in South Yorkshire. Sheffield, in particular, has always seemed to have had had ignorant, ill-informed, blinkered and disinterested future fanboys for councillors, so almost no old buildings of significance have escaped the wrecking ball. Maybe this skews my outlook, but it adds weight to the gravity of any threat to the Bath's design and architectural integrity.

Entrepreneurs are well-known danger takers within the field of enterprise but before taking any risk, they calculate all the things first and see if the risk is price taking.

and by P.I.M.P., I mean writer. Seriously y’all… I’m not sure how many of my readers know, but I love magazines. In fact, before realizing that being completely into the culture of magazines meant moving to NY, living off $29,000 a year and searching for a cardboard box to live in in Harlem, I really wanted to work for a magazine full time. That wasn’t always the case. I went to Howard with aspirations to do print and broadcast journalism, but after realizing that I didn’t like the newspaper grind and I didn’t like not writing in the broadcast realm, I learned more about magazines.

It is funny for someone who fears the beach I have managed to rack up visits to some of the most famous over the last few years such as Ipanema, Copacabana, Bondi and now I find myself in Daytona Beach. I went down to the reception desk in my hotel this morning to ask where the best places would be to go if say one wanted to do some shopping and this didn’t really illicit the response I was looking for in that apparentley there doesn’t seem to be any shops to visit and when I was foolish enough to suggest I might be able to walk to some of the places mentioned I was advised that may not be a good idea. It really scares me when I go somewhere that has such dependance on cars, you really can’t go anywhere without them. Anyway I decided to take a chance and go and visit a mall suggested.

Worst case scenario, it would seem Ray Shero should be looking to alleviate Salary Cap pressure by moving Martin off the roster and going with Despres, possibly using the Cap space to reinforce depth across the roster.
The illusion will always lead to disappointment; that is its nature, and because you have spent so much time in it you have come to expect that. But you are divinely created beings of enormous power, which means that you have the power to change the illusion and to awaken from it. Collectively, humanity is always changing the illusion by the very act of thinking about what is going on within it, although, because your thought processes are so conditioned by the illusion, what occurs often seems to be the complete opposite of what you hoped for and intended. Many of you, while hoping for the best, expect the worst and consequently, that is what it delivers.

Given that I would not use toxic chemicals in our house, or yard why would I use them on our pets? The same pets that climb into bed with my kids. Most commercial flea and tick remedies use pesticides, yes you read that right. The same pesticides that have labels warning of their hazards to humans, have instructions telling you to soak a flea-infected dog or cat thoroughly..These chemicals, especially in liquid form, can be absorbed through the animal's skin and taken up by the blood.What makes us think that this is good for our households and pet? It is especially important to remember when you use a powder that it may spread where ever the animals lies, again – the kids’ beds. Even in the midst of a flea invasion, it's important not to let the urgency of your need to get rid of the pests override concern for the safety of your pets and household.

My thinking of this changed after one writers’ meeting I attended. The speaker shared how God launched her career only after she relinquished her writing desires to God. That sounded like a great idea to me, so the next morning I got on my knees. The only problem was even as I prayed words that sounded good, I knew they didn’t come from my heart. If I was going to do this, I had to give Jesus everything—my hopes, my dreams, my longings. More than that, I needed to give Him access to myself. All of me.

This is a massive wasted opportunity. Rather than differentiating itself from the government and gaining credibility as a more reasoned and objective voice for reform, it seems Labour has chosen to adopt an almost identical path to that of the government.

And yet I know she never has been alone really. Yes, Mei had a life before we even knew her name. And it was a difficult... very difficult life. But there is One who has always known her name... who formed her in her mother's womb. Long before Mei was ours, she was HIS. And she still is. The same God who was her only consistent source of comfort during those 122 days in the hospital in her early life will be with us in Ohio. When I look at the child that Mei is now, there can be no doubt that there is a God who has walked with her, comforted her, healed her and redeemed her in the midst of all her suffering.

I felt betrayed. I felt like God had abandoned her. I felt like he had abandoned me. And Katie. And all the others who prayed for her. The God I knew would never do that. He would never let that happen. He had the power to fix her, so why wouldn't he use it? He had the power to end her suffering, so why wouldn't he use it? He had the power to do something - anything - so why wouldn't he use it? And the only answer I could come up with was that I was wrong about God. Either he wasn't who I thought he was, or he didn't exist at all. Both choices sucked, but the blind faith I had clung to for most of my life wasn't an option anymore.

Having misspellings or any grammar flaws will quickly lose credibility with your prospects. If you can’t get the presentation right, how are they to trust you to do work for them? It can be easy to rely on spellcheck, but that doesn’t mean spell check will catch everything, especially if sentences don’t make sense.

Our Guild's quilt show was this weekend. Yep, the one I busted my butt finishing quilts for. As I suspected, the Bloomin' Challenge quilt gained no recognition (and never in a million years did I expect that it would). Criminally, neither did the beautiful applique and beaded quilt I saw prior to finishing mine....you remember, the one that made me want to just chuck everything I had done into the dustbin. While the winners of this challenge were nice little quilts, they weren't stellar...just generic little quilts...not something you could describe in a conversation the next day (unlike this beaded beauty). I've pretty much concluded that judging in this contest has somewhat of a political skew to it. When I mentioned this to a fellow guild member, they laughed and congratulated me on figuring that out so quickly (my second challenge). Do you think she was being sarcastic?
So, thinking caps on, answers in the comments section please.
I like to use lace in different ways, whether as an actual base layer on which to build up stamped images, etc or to use lace as accents. When working with vintage images, stamped or printed, lace, to my mind, brings that extra something. The majority of the lace I use is new, that is primarily borne out of necessity as it is difficult for me to source vintage lace. Any vintage lace I do have is classed as "precious" so when using it I tend to use only the smallest of pieces. In most instances I mix new lace with a touch of vintage. I use one glue, UHU. As the art is not wearable art I find that UHU is a wonderful all purpose glue.
My mom never really sang my virtues. No positive traits here. I remember when I ran for all-school treasurer for my senior year in high school. I was sitting on the floor, making posters, when my mom looked at me sadly, and said,
We have a lot going on at Punky Sprouts. We are preparing for CHA and have lots going on. You are SOON going to see something that has been in the works!!!!
So much feels out of my control, but I cling to the idea that if something starts going wrong and I catch it quickly enough, maybe the worst can be averted.

Rescue Pegs are simple clip-on footpeg extensions for off-road motorcycles, designed to provide passengers a safe and easy place to position their feet. Most off-road motorcycles are not equipped with passenger footpegs, leaving nowhere for passengers to place their feet. Rescue Pegs offer a simple solution by clipping onto the existing footpegs providing twice the amount of footpeg space without permanent installation or modification of the bike.

You'll notice that this raw cupcake manual has me written all over it. Since I did it myself (instead of going with a big time book deal), I was able to do it on my terms, with my designs, photos, etc. Although I'll admit that I'm not the most experienced computer chic, I somehow managed to lay out each and every page in a fun, Rawdorable way.

Oh, and P.S. Is it un-PC of me (or Betty, for that matter) to be calling this “Oriental” Pork Soup? I was always taught that objects can be referred to as “Oriental,” but it just feels kinda wrong. I’ll blame it on Betty. Old bitty.
There are times when I wish I was an accomplished artist or a fantastic photographer, but alas, I am not. At times I struggle to find the right words to convey not only the sights but the sounds and the feeling of a town I visit, or a place that exists only in my mind.

Then, the most exciting news of all, on August 19th our sweet baby Jane joined our family! She was born at 1:59 am after 7 hours of labor (which was so much better than Annabelle's 16 hours of labor) and was 7lb 6oz 20 in long. Jane looks a lot like Annabelle when she was a baby but they definitely have their own personalities. We are so happy this sweet baby girl could join our family and Annabelle loves her new little sister! Jane is such a little live wire. Right when Jane was born she could lift her head and was always moving. She isn't my cuddly baby like Annabelle was but still a sweet, happy little one. She moves so much she learned to roll over at 3 1/2 months! Now at 5 months she is army crawling everywhere!!! Crazy huh! She is just a little determined one and is probably going to walk soon I swear!!! Jane just had her 4 month Dr appointment and she weighed 12 lb 2 oz which makes her only in the 10th percentile . She is just a little one and it's probably because she moves all the time. Annabelle is such a good big sister and loves to make her laugh. If she is sad she gives her toys and tries everything to make her happy. But there are those moments when I hear Jane cry and I see Annabelle trying to ride on her back like she does with daddy, but I guess that is just what big sisters do. :) It gets kind of crazy being a mom of two now but I love it and it is always an adventure!

Here’s why: After hours of stylists getting your hair and makeup just right, you don’t want – and in some cases may not be able to – pull your shirt over your head. It’ll be easier and mess-free to unbutton or unzip something. I’ve heard many stories of brides you had to be cut out of t-shirts and tank tops because pulling them off was not an option.
To be perfectly frank, Gentle Readers, I went into Matthias Goerne's Tuesday night recital with some doubts as to how a program constructed using selections from the Rückert-Lieder, Des Knaben Wunderhorn, and the Kindertotenlieder, as well as Shostakovich's settings of Michaelangelo sonnets (Op. 145,) would work. In the event, Goerne and pianist Leif Ove Andsnes gave a bold, gripping, and ultimately haunting performance. Whether hallucinatory or bitterly realistic, these meditations on the transformations of death were beautifully realized by pianist and singer. I was repeatedly astonished--and fascinated--by Goerne's powerful and flexible instrument, and the variety of emotional colors found by Andsnes in the piano part. The Mahler selections I know relatively well; the Shostakovich I knew not at all; interwoven, they proved emotionally powerful and philosophically stimulating.
And you know what? You are all right. Why don't we speak French to each other? Well there are many reasons why and the main ones being that by the time Sir Lancelot gets home at night he's exhausted and annoyed with the world (because let's all remember, he thinks he's running it) and for us to continue to have an adult relationship for the two to three hours a day that we see each other, it's counter-productive to attempt communication with my pitiful French. I can only go on about my day or the dinner I made in three, maybe four tenses with limited vocab.
I opened the report immediately and printed it out. I read it, but wasn’t at all sure of what I was reading. As I’ve always done, I was over-thinking – the results were so obvious that I just couldn’t trust the answer. So I went online and researched the numbers on the results. Full-Sibship = 5.84 and Half-Sibship 72.25. It seemed obvious enough that we were only half-siblings, but is that just what I WANTED to hear? I had to make certain. I researched an entire day, still shaky about what it all meant. Then I decided to call the lab. The lab tech pulled up my results and I asked her, “So, if I’m reading this correctly, there is a slight chance that my sister and I are full siblings? This doesn’t look conclusive.” She replied, “Oh this is absolutely conclusive. It shows that you and Sibling #2 are only half-siblings and could not possibly be full-siblings. There is no question based on the results of your tests.” YES!!!! Her words were spoken like the Angels in Heaven, reassuring me that the door to TRUTH had opened and the path I sought was now safe to travel – my journey had begun!

Charlene M. Proctor: Filtering life through “old programming” is a widespread experience that many people feel they are living life unconsciously. Their reaction to current day situations stems from past behaviors or experiences that prevent them from living a full life. Old programming is the carryover of emotional patterns. We inherit these patterns from culture and our families. Negative statements such as “you are not good enough” are examples. Religion is responsible for a lot of societal conditioning, as well as old traumas, dramas, or stories. This becomes a ‘knee jerk reaction to living’ and results in a person living on autopilot where every experience is filtered through old programming. Many people empty, automated, and “without life.” Like machines, people are meeting their needs by focusing on task lists, logic, achievement, materialism, doing and not being.

It’s been a rough day for us which is evidenced by the fact that we’re still here in the hospital. We did have a nice afternoon with a sweet visit from Sophie. I can’t begin to explain what a neat thing it is to see these two precious lives right before my very eyes. These two lives, that by the very grace of God I said YES to, despite their possible “inconveniences” of being “unplanned” or “imperfect”. These two individuals were both very planned and very perfect!!

Naming was hard, as usual. The last cat we had didn't really ever get a proper name. We just called her several things, the main one being Baby, so this time I spent a good amount brainstorming things to call her. It's hard, everything seems either too twee, or prim, or too lady-like for her. At first I thought I'd name her 'Cake' because it seemed like it sort of fit, but after a few days it just didn't really seem to be working.
I've been doing my best to ride it all out, but I'm finding that I'm getting spread a bit thin.

DS asks about dealing with the competition: I was trying to find an older post, but none of my search phrases netted what I was looking for. I was recently out with a girl and she mentioned "this guy she's dating," and none of the things were very positive. I remember a post that talked about how to handle situations like that, if I should talk bad about the guy or encourage a break up. I couldn't remember what the course of attack should be, so I tried to remain neutral. Any tips on where that post might be found, or maybe just a brief refresher? No clue about the post, but my recommendation, assuming that her involvement with the other guy isn't a dealbreaker at this stage, is to simply ignore his existence and make it clear that you have zero interest in discussing him or anyone else interested in her. This is where Deltas and Gammas tend to make their mistake and either a) leap at the chance to sing, dance, and look like the Potentially Better Boyfriend, or b) leap into the Friend Zone by providing a shoulder upon which she can cry. If she brings the other guy up again after the first time, simply raise your eyebrows and say something like "I had no idea you were still hitting that... interesting."

I just watched the "Superheroes" documentary, made my Michael Barnett, for the second time. And again, I finished watching it with an odd feeling of hope and inspiration. For anyone who hasn't seen it, the film follows small groups of civilians, and in all honesty, nerds...who dress up like their own unique superhero and attempt to stop crime and injustice in their cities. Everything from confronting drug dealers in a park, putting up flyers to raise awareness about a local "groper", and a lot of community outreach to the homeless...giving food/water/hygienic products and most importantly, a connection to people who don't look at them like second class human beings.

The Wisconsin trio captures nearly two decades of post-punk smarminess with Viva Wisconsin, a live retrospective recorded during a one-week tour of their home state in October 1998 that boasts a depth of song choices and performances. Whether playing their best-known hits or lesser-known classics, the band delivers great live performances with largely nothing more than the acoustic bass, drums, and guitar they are known for. The alternative radio staples "Blister in the Sun," "Gone Daddy Gone," and "Kiss Off" are here, of course, but longtime fans and new initiates will love the variety of songs spanning the band's career. Dark gems like the twisted sagas "Country Death Song," "Gimme the Car," and "Hallowed Ground" showcase singer/songwriter Gordon Gano's capacity for spinning haunting tales. Creepy anthems of alienation like "Prove My Love" and "Confessions" show off the trio's musical virtuosity. Fans love the Femmes for their ability to merge punk, rockabilly, and roots rock with pain-ridden lyrics and pissed-off vibes. Their best anthems, like "American Music," "Black Girls," and the sublime "Add It Up," are played here with crackling intensity. This collection is a must for Femmes fans and a great way to introduce casual fans to the band's body of work.

Rather than a tutorial, the rest of this article will hit the high-points of the exercise itself. The instructions break the exercise into 7 sessions preceded by a pre-stage and approximate about 16 hours to complete the work. Each session is separated from one another by drying time. Since I mastered some wet-on-wet skills in my still-life exercise, I actually followed a few of the sessions in relatively close succession to gain a more of a plein-aire (working on the scene outdoors) feel to my workflow. In fact, sessions 1, 2, 3, and 4 were closely spaced. The drying period is essential between sessions 4 and 5, and 5 and 6.
For the last three weeks or so, I went to the dr. each week and when she would check my cervix, I was not appearing to be dilating at all. Finally at 39 weeks, we talked about some things we could do to "ripen" my cervix to see if we could get me going. So, 2 weeks ago, I went to the hospital to have some gels inserted to ripen my cervix (yes, it's just as fun and comfortable as it sounds!!!) Went back to Dr. on Friday and still nothing.. we made a plan to have me go in on Wednesday, 7/13, evening, have Cervidil (another ripening albeit more strong gel) inserted and then the following morning, we'd check me and if I had made progress, we'd induce and if not, we'd go for a c-section. Honestly, was totally fine with that option. I went again on Tuesday morning to check things out and still nothing at all. So, I asked, "why would we even do cervidil if nothing else has worked, why wouldn't we just go ahead with a c-section".. she said it was my choice so I opted for a c-section, scheduled for Thursday, the 14th at 1:30...WELL, things did not go as planned b/c the next day, after we dropped my dad off for his dialysis (yes, my parents arrived almost a week early and just had to hang out and wait with me!! ) we headed to Target. In the car, I felt as if I might be peeing on myself and was like "you have got to be kidding me!!". So we got to Target, and I went to the bathroom, realized that I was not peeing, but my water had broken and came out to tell my mom. I called Tim to come get me while my mom finished up what she needed to do and then go get my dad. WE arrived at the hospital and determined that since I had just eaten (In N Out burger!!), I had to wait for 8 hours until we could go into surgery... so, that's what we did. Just wait and wait and wait!!! I was surprisingly calm until they came in to prep me and tell me what was going to go down.. then the nerves kicked in. I was wheeled into the operating room around 9ish and at 9:29, Mac came right out!!! Tim was very emotional, and I was just relieved!! Everyone kept saying how cute he was so I was anxious to see him!! When Tim brought him over to me, I just melted. It really is a miracle that he's here! If you know my story, we never thought this would ever happen for us and everything just went text book and perfect and now we have the most beautiful addition to our family.

Schreiber's book is loaded with color photos and each page is devoted to a different edible flower. Organized alphabetically, the book gives descriptions of how to grow, harvest and prepare each plant and also gives cautionary advice about some of their health impacts (i.e., don't consume chamomile if you are taking blood thinners). A recipe section at the back lists many scrumptious and unusual dishes that will appeal to all five senses, including Fresh Salsa with Pineapple and Nasturtiums, Watermelon and Feta Salad and Lemon Verbena Salmon.

By the end of the decade, I personally had white bell bottoms, a large chrome buckle, and an vivid orange turtleneck. Yes, and I wore a peace symbol necklace. And I was one of the conservative dressers. It was a “colorful era” to say the least. My parents felt toward me as I now feel toward droopy pants and tattered jeans.

The research into the impact of microfinance that has emerged over the last five years offers some encouraging results. There is evidence from a number of studies (using a variety of methodologies across different settings) suggesting that microfinance is good for microbusinesses. This result is observed across different microfinance services, including microcredit and microsavings instruments. Based on the studies in this survey, the overall effect on the incomes and poverty rates of microfinance clients is less clear, as are the effects of microfinance on measures of social well-being, such as education, health, and women’s empowerment. Hopefully, the next wave of research will provide further insights into these critical questions.

We would not expect a Negro Spiritual to mean anything in a Catholic liturgy any more than we would expect the Salve Regina to mean anything in a black church is rural Mississippi. We understand this when we talk about other traditions or religions; anyone would acknowledge that Gregorian chant would be out of place in a Mennonite gathering hall or that a genuflection inside a Mosque would be highly improper; why are Catholics alone not able to exercise this same sort of reasoning when it comes to foreign customs transplanted into our own tradition?
So, I did what any self-respecting American expat would do - I bought a Herald Tribune (to hell with French newspapers) and a big cup of American coffee from Starbucks (forget about tiny little espressos) and settled into my seat on the TGV. No doubt about it, I was in an expat funk. Fortunately, I had such a good time chatting with Gwan that I completely forgot about French politics. Or at least I put them out of my mind until I received a message from my daughter asking if I had read the Op-Ed in the New York Times written by Rosecrans Baldwin, the author of Paris, I Love You but You're Bringing Me Down. When Sara added that she found it strange that I hadn't blogged about the elections, I responded like a rebellious teenager, "It's not my country - I only live here. The French can do whatever they want!".

During the war, Libya was only producing a small proportion of its pre-war crude oil output making the rebels eager to obtain deals that involved providing crude oil and getting oil products in return. Vitol, who are primarily a physical distribution energybusiness, were one of the few energy companies who took on the challenge ofsupplying the Libyan rebels with much needed oil products during the civil unrest. According to The Financial Times, the risk of this operation was ‘heightened because it (Vitol) supplied most of the fuel without upfront payment’. In September 2011, Reuters reported that the Libyan oil firm Agoco had promised togive half its early crude oil production to Vitol as payment for fuel provided to the rebels. The information manager at Libya’s Arabian Gulf Oil Company, Mr Abdeljalil Mayouf, commented that the ‘fuel from Vitol was very important for the military’.

You could start with "Flashforward." Are you watching the TV show? Well. The book is nothing like it. In the novel, there is an event that causes everyone in the world to black out - and see a vision of their future. In the tv show, that future takes place in 6 months. In the book - 20 years. What makes the book so very good is the philosophical angle. Do we control our own destiny? Is the future fixed? Is it malleable?

But, that black cloud over our shoulders decided to provide some drama. The first raindrops fell, harmless at first. Then, a clap of thunder. Chairs got picked up and taken inside the gym, which somehow had breathed a bit and was not quite so claustrophobic. Rain began to pelt down on the metal roof. We still couldn't hear each other. But, we worked past that, too, and got through a complicated agenda. Turns out, that old gym was a good place to be on a rainy Thursday night.

We ran her into the bathroom and opened the toilet and she spewed blood! I immediately put on my clothes and shoes preparing to head to the ER as we awaited our on-call doctor to call us back. This time they called ahead to the ER and they said they would just admit us when we got there. Once we were there they started an IV, took more urine, took more blood and sent us upstairs to our room. They wore gloves and gowns anytime they came in the room, and they were great! The doctors were really nice and examined her from head to foot!! They discovered she didn't just have strep but she had tonsillitis as well! They believed the blood was from a tear in her esophagus from vomiting, or a result of not eating or drinking for so long and it caused acid build-up in her stomach.

My whole thing is, I have learned from all of my trials and tribulations that I don’t want for anything. I have more love given to me than any man has a right to have, but I have it, and I am grateful to all who are there providing it for me. I’m grateful that I was resourceful enough to find food and shelter when I seemingly had nowhere to go. I’m even grateful for all those people that provided free drugs so I wasn’t bored out of mind when I was uninspired to do anything else. In other words, I am thankful for everything I have, or had, that helped me get to where I am right now, which is OK. Happy, Beloved, Alive, and Able to express my gratitude to all those living here with me, in body or in spirit.
My friends were fed up with you. Halos masuka na nga sila sa pagsasawa sayo at sa mga kwento ko tungkol sayo. Pero ako hindi nagsawa. Tinatanong nila ko dati, bakit ikaw? Though I didn’t have an answer, it didn’t matter. Everyone thought we were forever. And everyone was wrong. Apat na taon na ang nakakaraan, pero minsan tinatanong ko pa rin kung san ako nagkamali, nagkulang. Hindi pa rin siguro sapat ang dalawang taon para mapalitan ko siya sa puso mo.

I am one week away from finishing my second year of college. It feels so surreal, I still can’t get my head around it. I finished my last class this morning and finals start tomorrow and I’m completely done on Monday. So much has been happening the past few weeks, everything is such a blur. I also haven’t written any posts in a while and that has been nagging at me.

My one friend left before Peter arrived. Then Peter arrived, I introduced everyone to him and I began to serve a few appetizers. Everyone had a drink, Peter didn’t drink so had a soft drink and was doing very well. He knew quite a bit about each person there as I’d discussed them all with him during our life coaching sessions. He handled himself well, as did my guests. We sat down to dinner, I was very focused on getting everyone served. The wine was flowing, everyone was eating, dinner turned out fine.

Studying the shoes and their chronological sequence is an interesting peek into my shoe psyche. Although I clearly show a frivolous side early on (lime green pumps), I stick to mostly brown, black, and, the classic, red for the first few years. (Not pictured here are two pairs of black pumps, a pair of khaki pumps, and one pair each of black and khaki slingbacks that I wore to death.) As I progressed through the Maslow hierarchy of needs (red, black, and brown shoes = the physiological needs and safety), brightly colored shoes met my requirements for love, belonging, and esteem, until I finally reach self-actualization with a pair of freakin rad plaid pumps.

All of this hasn’t changed much as I’ve gotten older. I do have an appreciation for nature, but hiking and bird watching aren’t my thing. That being said, we have gotten to live in some amazing places when it comes to nature. Our last home was in Monterey Bay, California. We saw whales, otters, sea stars, and more in the wild. Sri Lanka is really determined to one up that. We have seen monkeys and monitor lizards in the wild. My kids have held newly hatched sea turtles. Gertrude Bell even got to take one fresh from the sand to the tank. The International Man of Intrigue and I saw a giant saltwater crocodile swimming down a river once when we were driving. It still makes my stomach turn, as I’m not entirely sure it wasn’t this guy, although I do think the one we saw was bigger.
This is a low-magic setting for sure. Magic exists of course (Excalibur, Merlin, - duh!), but it tends to be more epic in nature, more rare, and truly sought after stuff. You might base a quest of a couple years on finding a rare magic sword, for instance. And no player Knights can cast spells. But there are plenty of monsters to deal with. :)

I didn’t get all of the bells and whistles that come with a new camera – it’s better than that: I already have a memory card and USB cords, and when I looked for an updated version of Kodak Easyshare software, I found out you can get it for free from Kodak’s website. Love it.

When he got rich, he inevitably bought a boat and even tried to give that class by naming it ‘Get ‘em Off’ – but in Latin. His girlfriend Fiona Richmond’s mother was, at the time, a teacher in a convent and got the nuns to translate the words into Latin, though quite how she managed this without suspicions being aroused remains a complete mystery to me.

Every hotel now has a huge mall attached. The ones that don’t are O-U-T, not cool and too far away to get to except by expensive cab. Every mall has the exact same stores, and all those stores can be seen in Sex and the City episodes. I’m talking Tiffany’s, Gucci, Armani, Prada, etc. These are stores that only the infamous 1% (OK, maybe the 5%, too) can afford to shop in. That must be why they had no one in them. Seriously, I only saw a handful of stores with anyone in them. These stores charge so much for their merchandise that they must stay in business on one or two sales a day. Can you imagine? It’s like evil. I’m not sure I saw a single Gap (already overpriced), and forget Target or Walmart (not that they’re not evil, with their sweatshops and country-sized economies). The two or three Walgreens sell used casino dice for $4 a pair.

But Katie is a survivor. Since then, she has grown from the sad and broken little girl we took into our home that day, into an amazing and beautiful and talented young lady with a heart of pure gold. She has her mother's eyes. She has her mother's heart. She has her mother's spirit, and her mother's voice. Not a day goes by that I don't think of Jill and thank her for giving us this amazing gift. Katie still has days when she feels her loss. She still has moments when the grief sneaks up on her and knocks her flat. She still wakes up sometimes crying for her mother after a bad dream. But she goes on. She has thrived in spite of it all.

For the three I got from the same seller I thought I had been shilled. The opening bid for those three were just 99¢ (one of them might have been a little more). On all three of them the same bidder with a large feedback number had bid, but my max had them outbid. One of them a second person bid on it bringing the total number of bids up to 5. Now that I study the bid history and bid times it looks like that first bidder was trying to snipe me unsuccessfully. Probably a seller trying to get something for real cheap and then turn it around for an insanely inflated profit. They were 3 day auctions and the later bids were on the final day. Even if I was "shilled" I got them for nice prices so it is OK.

I had the privilege of being present at a baby shower last weekend, and the joy of a wonderful Cape vacation this weekend…and all I constantly found myself thinking about was the spiritual discipline of joy.

I am not going to blast Roddenberry much more in this review, save to say he was not a very good writer. Like George Lucas, he can create wonderful universes, but he has to hand them over to others for them to shine. Roddenberry also made a mistake by using a script from the scrapped Star Trek: Phase II series as the script for TMP. One of the biggest problems with TMP is a slow paced, padded story that does not merit being a major motion picture. It is just not big enough.
We jump right into the first team challenge of the season. The cooks are taken to a busy office building in Los Angeles where they get to feed over 300 people in the cafeteria during the lunch rush.

Max and Derrick, as the winners of the last challenge, get to choose their teams.

But what it also did was cause me to think of the spiritual principle our dogs illustrated. Their food bowls were empty and had been empty for quite some time. Both Buddy and Duke are strays we rescued, so they had been on their own before, yet they stayed. Why did they stay and not go wandering to at least look for food? Because of loyalty and also a form of faith deep inside them, faith that we loved them and would always take care of them. Now I know they are only dogs and don’t display the higher cognitive thinking abilities we humans have, but there is a core deep inside them, a trust and faithfulness that we should all make note of.

So if the W02 has a forward biased aero balance, this would move the car closer towards corner entry oversteer. We’ve also seen the mid season wing upgrade displays some flexibility, as with many teams front wings. This would have the effect of moving the front wing in yet closer proximity to the track and create even more front downforce at higher speeds.

Tico Rico by Hank Crawford: Hank Crawford recorded many albums for the Atlantic, Kudu and Milestone labels during his career, but very few on any label that had more than one or two great tunes. This is one that is terrific from start to finish, with Crawford in perfectly bluesy and swinging form, driven by Matthews's superb, yet simplified, electrifying charts. If a soloist is only as good as his arranger, then Matthews is probably the best Crawford ever had (and Crawford was the guy who arranged for Ray Charles!). Tico Rico - which has never been issued on CD - is undoubtedly their best work together. There is a high quotient of Matthews originals here, all quite good too: "Tico Rico," "Lady Soul," the late-night blues of "Lament" and the grooving drive of "Funky Rooster." Eric Gale, a perfect compliment to many a Hank Crawford record, solos magnificently on the title track, the sensational take on the Beatles' "I've Just Seen A Face," "Lament," "Funky Rooster" and pretty much throughout the rest of the record. Cliff Carter is on keyboards here, but sounds an awful like Gale's Stuff-mate Richard Tee. Flautist Jeremy Steig is featured on the title track and the invigoratingly funky, yet too-silly titled "Funky Rooster" (a follow-up to the pair's earlier "Funky Pigeon," but probably meant to have some corollary with the era's "Disco Duck"). Matthews and Crawford deliver two terrific covers here, a lovely reggae take on The Beatles' "I've Just Seen A Face," which must have seemed an odd choice to cover in 1977, and one of the least corny takes of "Teach Me Tonight" ever heard. Matthews provides an alluring, romantic underscore that Crawford simply sets alight. A fine achievement for both Hank Crawford and David Matthews.

I'd assumed I would make this classic bread, taste it for nostalgia's sake, and that would be it before moving on to something more exotic and delicious.

The thirties are one of my favourite vintage periods so I am always excited to see looks inspired by this era come back around in fashion. Most of the ones on offer on the high street do have a very convincing vintage feel to them but how I'd love to find an original one! My favourite version is the Marks and Spencer one pictured with its cropped cut, nipped in waist and the way the soft folds of its luxuriously large, stand up shawl collar frames the neck and face of the wearer. The size of the collar and its shape was a key feature of the most popular Burberry Prorsum model and which most other high street versions have failed to capture as successfully.
There’s just two little problems: The alleged shooter, Jake England, 19, doesn’t look mighty white to me (but I guess that, like George Zimmerman, he’s white enough for their purposes—“white-Native Indian”?), and the shootings were not random. England looks Injun to some of my readers, and I concur. And the shootings were targeted. Friday was the two-year anniversary of the racist murder of England’s father by blacks, and either the shooter decided to target any black man, the way racist blacks will target “random” whites, or he was targeting men who had murdered, or been accomplices in his father’s murder.

This would make a blown rear wing (BRW), the added flow from the exhaust aiding the wing in creating downforce at lower speeds.

The class has reinforced the knowledge that I serve the Lord with my mind; therefore, I must think correctly, renew my mind, and stay focused on the things of God. Until now, I had thought that it was all about my spirit. With my mind I serve the Lord (Romans 7:25) and with the spirit I worship Him (John 4:23). I will serve Him with my intellect and all the gifts and talents He has bestowed upon me, in helping writers and authors get started. In the process of serving him with my mind, I will constantly renew my mind with the Word of God, so that my spirit is aligned with the Holy Spirit, allowing me to worship Him in spirit and in truth.

With all the chaos, the singing and shouting, and the live cast doing there thing it was at times hard to know what to pay attention to. The live performers were fantastic and featured some inspired casting choices (for example, Rocky was played by a rather attractive red-headed girl in a gold bikini) that made for some extra hilarious moments. By the time the credits rolled it was clear that I had gotten the total Rocky Horror experience, but there had been so much going on that I knew I would have to watch the movie itself again. So a few days later I got a copy from Netflix and watched the movie at home. The songs have now been stuck in my head for over a week and I can honestly say I’m hooked. I watched a “making of” special and interview with the show’s creator, Richard O’Brien, on youtube and caught the Rocky Horror episode of “Glee” on Netflix Instant. I can’t wait to take friends who have never gone to a midnight screening so that they can lose there “virginity” and have as much fun as I did, and if a stage production hits any of the live theatres in the area any time soon I’m tempted to go audition. It’s a bit surprising that it took me so long to finally see the movie after first hearing those songs at Fiesta Texas all those years ago, but it’s safe to say I’ll be a life long fan now that I’ve discovered it. Now I guess it’s time for me to get around to watching another classic musical movie I’ve never seen: “Grease”.

Like I said . . . a sobering thought. There are a million reasons standing in our lives TODAY to be happy. We all have families, friends, life around us. What a tragedy if we miss it because we're waiting for some life defining event that we can't guarantee will come. I was so worried about writing life, I forgot to live.

I now firmly believe that weight, health, physical fitness, all that stuff that fits into wellness, it starts in your heart and in your mind. Since I have begun to make small changes, and taken the time to plan, prepare, and work at following the blueprint, I have seen tremendous changes in my life. I’ve manage to tame the office nut, my marriage has done a complete 180, my kids are suddenly a little more well-behaved, and I am finally seeing the physical results I have longed for.
Meanwhile, I’ve put the script in ‘the vault’ where those in the know can read it and wallow in the misery of another poorly written script.

There’s one particular day that I remember spending in this atmosphere that I want to talk about. Prior to going anywhere different than home I knew for sure one thing- that I’d grown up with a compassionate heart and my one goal in life was to simply help people, I didn’t care who or how, just that I wanted to help. So going into a poverty stricken nation, where trafficking of all sorts was prominent, coming out of it I don’t know how my heart was kept together except the fact that I know God walked with me through those streets.

Redefining the role of ‘token old legend’ Gladys Knight took the stage and the audience by storm! She moves extremely well, has charm and personality for days and nothing to lose. Her career doesnt hinge on winning or losing. She’s here simply to edify her own interests and satisfaction. She may not win, but she wont be a shrinking, shriveling old violet that withers and lets age become an issue.
I urgently needed quick and easy dessert to make with things I already have in my kitchen, so that I don't have to run to the grocery store in the famous afternoon KL traffic.

That points of course to antagonists, but also to others. My friend Josephine pointed out the character of William Randolph Hearst in The Aviator as someone who was fascinating because of the extent of his suffering, even when his behavior in general was off the charts and hard to relate to. My own character Nekantor from "The Eminence's Match" is a "twisted piece of work" to quote my author friend Lillian Csernica (she notes that she meant this in a positive way!). He does cruel and evil things but is motivated at least partially by his own obsessive-compulsive disorder.
1. Make sure that on the Friday before they are met with some unexpected surprises. I started by taking him to lunch on Friday. (And even though my Granny and my mom showed up at the exact same restaurant at the exact same time and even though they waved at us and had the waiter seat them at our table, I was not undeterred. It just meant I had to come up with extra bonuses later in the day.)

As I walked, I was thinking the day was lost. I just wanted to get home and take a bath and eat a salad (to balance out those potato chips) and watch the opening ceremonies of the Olympics and consider it a not-significant day at all.

And yes, stay-at-home moms do work. Most of them. But the ones who have a squadron of nannies and domestic "help?" maybe not so much. And yes, cooking, cleaning and rearing children is definitely hard work, but you know what? Working mothers do all those jobs, too. In addition to their salary-earning jobs, so maybe let's knock off the martyr act?
Now, greedy soldiers toss out dice to see who gets the bragging rights of owning the traditional garment she lovingly created for her son when he left home. The garment saturated with the perfumed oil of spikenard from the broken alabaster passion box.
“Charon rarely draws or paints figures – largely because they are a bit more difficult than sticking fake jewellery on badly drawn sharks…but he has made an exception with this dancer based on a fashion designer style. Charon was having lunch, as he does most Sundays, at a local pub the weekend before Christmas. The team at the pub are great – they ensure that Charon can have roast chicken each Sunday even when it is not on the official ‘menu’. One of the waitresses, Amy, who is doing Chemistry at university (Charon did Geophysics and Geochemistry for one short year many years ago) asked him what he was doing for Christmas. ‘Drinking and painting’ was Charon’s reply. When it became clear that Charon was not planning some orgy of DIY decorating and wallpapering over the festive season, Amy asked if Charon could do a painting for her. While Charon was enthusiastic about the possibility of painting a roast chicken he did feel that Amy might not be so enthusiastic about such a subject…. a RED dancer seemed an appropriate theme!”
Enrique Gil as Troy
Gregory Peck, star of such classic films as Moby Dick, To Kill a Mockingbird and The Guns of Navarone, portrayed Lincoln for this 1982 miniseries. Although a relatively minor role in the series, Peck once again shines out above the rest of the cast, giving a truly memorable performance as Lincoln (His recitation of the Gettysburg Address is truly memorable). Peck felt himself too old to portray the character, but that did not stop him from turning in a fantastic performance.

Who gave kids permission to watch porn anyway? Shouldn’t they be studying? The sign of the times shows many young boys and girls are glued to their wifi and broadband connects drowning in a sea of porn. It’s no wonder that Tera was spotted. After all, who could forget a face? All that loud noise and positions and…well you get the point. Haven’t you always wondered about how the Porn stars moved about their lives after making such a movie?

I plan to blog every Monday about where I am to keep me accountable. So, here we go
It's good to be back in control again, of myself that is. I'm finally feeling better, moving more and making healthier choices, again! I can honestly say that I'm so glad to see November gone, it was a sick month and I mean that in almost everyway. Good things still happened, it was just hard to embrace them whilst I was clinging to my barf bucket. :)
So silent has the media been about the killing of Kris Donald, that in all likelihood were you to ask ten randomly chosen members of the public who he was, you would be lucky if one out of the ten had ever heard of him. Yet ask the same ten who the most famous victim of racial violence in the UK, and almost certainly they will all say Stephen Lawrence.
I’ve always loved music – unbeknown to me at the time – I liked a few DnB tracks too! The Shy FX tune ‘Shake Your Body’ came out when I was 12 in 2001 and I loved it, I remember loving it every time the video came on MTV and dancing in my living room to it. I didn’t know what Drum and Bass was at the time but I know I liked it! When I was younger I used to write songs and sing, I remember trying to produce electronic music to go with the lyrics on my keyboard or on crappy software but I’d get frustrated because it was very limited what I had to work with. I used to love going raving and to the parties back home and would always want to be the one performing.

So, the challenge I issue today to you and to myself is to make an intentional effort to love someone you disagree with. Find someone who has harmed you and make an effort to forgive them. Make every effort to reconcile with them. And even if you can’t, make every effort to let go of the hate. Make every effort to be the sort of person who others will look at and say, “Wow! Look how that person loves!”

I always say that you cannot play football if you do not know the rules. What is penalties, what is of side, direct and indirect kicks, the list is endless. The players, the referee, the fans everybody who is involved in one way or another must know these rules, otherwise they will fall out of place. In the same say, ensuring that communication across border is effective and that business transactions are successful it is important to understand cultural differences and promoting cultural sensitivity. If you are observant, you will notice that each country has its own cultural standards of being, thinking and acting. Their cultural differences strongly influence their business setups, values and naturally business communication. What you may consider as perfectly acceptable and natural in your own country, can be considered as confusing or even offensive in business setups of other country.

I will skip track again tonight and try again. Another short, easy route. I will stretch and foam roll. Maybe run just a tad more and see if the soreness gets worked out. I’ll keep this up, slowly adding more miles, then try for one more ten mile run next weekend. If it’s terrible I will have to skip the race, but if it’s not, I’ll go for it!

GREENBELT, Md. -- Researchers and flight crew with NASA's Operation IceBridge, an airborne mission to study changes in polar ice, began another season of science activity with the start of the 2012 Arctic campaign on March 13. From mid-March through mid-May, a modified P-3 from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Wallops Island, Va., will conduct daily missions out of Thule and Kangerlussuaq, Greenland —with one flight to Fairbanks, Alaska and back—to measure sea and land ice. The campaign will also feature instrument tests, continued international collaboration and educational activities.

We saw the stage play “Pornographic Angel” while in New York. But I had yet to dive into the actual short stories that the play was based on until day 115. (Ok, I have a copy in English, I’ll admit it.) I can definitely say that you will see the less pleasant side of Brazilian cultural within these stories.

So the experiment to place “Good Morning America” at 3 p.m. — yes, the time slot that “General Hospital” holds — and move “GH” to 2 p.m. could mean that “Katie” — yes, that Katie — could have an hourlong “Good Morning America” as a lead-in.
When Chickie was three we bought a front porch. It was a glorious Southern porch complete with a wicker swing and a ceiling fan, hanging ferns and azalea bushes. English Ivy creeped up the sides and it looked out on a magnolia tree and a Bradford pear. The front walk was lined with monkey grass and the two corners hosted bushes that erupted into a profusion of white blooms every spring. The porch was a cheerful sight to neighbors walking dogs and kids on bikes.

As one who tries to keep up with what’s going on in the world, especially the world of humans as they interact with the environment, I check out the Sierra Club’s monthly magazine column “Up To Speed” from time to time. In that column they list some of the more notable things going on around the world that affect us all. Let’s start with the bad news in the latest edition of the magazine.
Mum was a middle class Anglican and Dad a working class Catholic, so the relationship wasn’t particularly welcomed in either family. But the week following their meeting, the couple arranged to go to the Premier Cinema in Cheetham Hill. My mother was a Junior swimming champion who had damaged her ears diving, and so was already a little hard of hearing . Her condition was described as a ‘perforation of the inner ear’. As usual when they took their seats in the cinema, there was one of those wartime Mr Chumleigh-Warner information films on before the main movie.
I was too cool for D&D.
Which part of the story was special, you ask: the dinner or the concert? They both were special, in the sense that I felt a connection. I felt a connection with my Dad, with the staff at Walker’s Grille, with Arlo and the band, and with the audience (the majority of which have been loyal fans of the Guthrie family even before Woodstock). Feeling connected is the most awe-inspiring experience you could ever give to yourself; it is the best gift on Earth.

If you are in doubt about how bad blogs can be, check out this little gem, which I found by hitting that "Next blog" button. They discuss an "anti-semantic" (sic) chain letter from MySpace. That's right, they are slagging off anti-semantics, when in fact, they are anti-semantic themselves. If only they were pro-semantic, they would know that what they mean to say, of course, is "anti-Semitic." The unintentional irony is killing me.

Being straight, white, male, upper-class, able-bodied, etc., is not a default state for human existence. It’s therefore unreasonable to expect people who do not meet those criteria (or at least several of them) to experience creative works solely or primarily through characters who do. There is no such thing as an Everyman who has experiences that are truly universal. Attempts at boosting equality that attempt to genericize people to a standard set by a privileged ruling class are at best, misguided, and do nothing to actually improve things for people in marginalized groups.
In comparison to my more recent posts, this is not a breakthrough in design, simply a chance to see the teams playing with packaging to achieve similar aims.

Because we see things through Andy's eyes, the reader first encounters Vietnam as "the other" and "strange". Here is Andy, observing a street scene: "a skinny woman squatting over a charcoal fire or a few sticks of burning wood -- right there on the roadside, amid all the dust and refuse and traffic fumes. Andy was shocked. Where where the health inspectors?" Andy's thinking is very much that of an eleven year old, especially an eleven year old experiencing culture shock. Andy's attitude softens as he learns more about the cultural and economic differences between Vietnam and Australia. His attitude and reaction is balanced by occasionally seeing things through the eyes of his cousin, Minh. Andy may start by seeing Vietnam as "the other," but as the story progresses he matures past that, just like the reader will.

So here’s one thing I know about church singing: the people who do it well aren’t much interested in the people who don’t. But it didn’t matter. Taize chanting was not about the perfection of any given voice, but the joining of all voices in prayer. And when those voices rose up from kneeling souls, they were the most beautiful sound on earth. And the blessing of singing them was why I had come, not to learn to sing them better. I smiled and thought of the author John Updike who claimed that the reason he went to church every Sunday was that it was the only place on earth where no one would stop him from singing. If you’re like me and John, we welcome you into the pews.

We had better success the second day with a huge slice of pizza each at a little place near the Brooklyn Bridge ($20 for 4 big slices and 4 drinks). For dinner that night we chose Lasagna, an Italian restaurant near our hotel in Chelsea. You don't even want to know how much our meal cost, but it was totally worth it. The food was excellent and the service spectacular, and we got to eat outside on the sidewalk, watching the passersby. Again, we chalked that cost up to experiencing New York.

One of the best ways of retaining moisture in your borders is to add a 2 inch layer of mulch on top of wet (and weed-free) borders (without suffocating your plants in the process). This also has the benefit of keeping weeds to a minimum, and if you are using organic material, in time worms will work the mulch down into the soil adding goodness. There are numerous materials you could use – well-rotted manure, garden compost, mushroom compost (but not for acid soils), hop manure, cocoa shell, bracken….
I left home at one in the morning. After much thought I’d figured this was a good time to leave since I would avoid any late evening traffic leaving the city and yet be able to ride a good six to seven hours before it started to get really hot. The beginning of summer is not the best time of the year to go riding and I’d been warned that the highway to Tumkur was the busiest one leaving Bangalore and so I wanted to make the most of the early hours. The day had been spent taking the cycle over to the mechanic for one last look, printing out the altitudinal profile of the route in roughly 100k sections and collecting all the equipment and some food. I had two saddle bags, one was my jhola tied to the side which carried a tooth-paste, tooth-brush etc; on the other side was my small trail pack with a compact pump, spare tube, basic set of wrenches, puncture-repair kit, swiss-knife, thread, torch, headlamp, phone charger, wallet etc. And the handle-bag had my hydration pack and some packets of juice. I carried, along with the one liter hydration pack, two liter-bottles of water. The cycle seemed rather heavy with all this on. It’s a rather heavy cycle to begin with actually, but I love it all the same. It is a Hero Hawk, the cheapest hybrid bike I know of which I’ve fitted with Fomas brake handles, a Rockrider seat and B-twin handle bar tape.

In my playthrough, I met the minimum requirements and got Illusive Man to kill himself and save Anderson. There’s a nice scene between Shepard and Anderson after the Catalyst has been activated. The scene is very poignant and bittersweet. The way the scene plays out feels as if the game should have ended there. It’s after this moment that the ending gets really confusing and has become the full blown controversy it has been.

Many people do not notice they are a parasite, which has been around 30000-100000 ages, which continues to thrive worldwide. Head lice home remedies have proven significantly popular substitute to the insecticide of the shampoo. One complaint Ive heard come out again and again is how schools deal with attacks. Although lice are as a rule disposed of by mixing the color of the hair and scalp, these creatures are still quite easy to detect. Continue this process at least 3 to 4 times for two weeks time.
There is a romance, and one that I enjoyed a lot. The guy and Jasmine just get off to a really bad start, and first impressions make quite the impression.

They had great chemistry; they're safely one of my top 5 fave couples for this year. Realistic - no insta-love going on ANYWHERE in here.
Unless we succeed in blowing up the core of the planet or our Sun becomes a red dwarf which isn’t going to happen for a few million years, we need to get a grip and especially as pagans to make the changes we want to see and we need to persuade others that what we do IS good for the planet.

It’s sad to think that children are ending their lives because they don’t want to face the torment of a bully any longer. The young man who ended his life two weeks ago must have thought the same thing. Trying to “fit in” is bad enough without people making fun or you or chastising you for being yourself.
Long story short - how did the religious family end up? My brother’s friend moved to Tennessee and joined a cult that steam-cleans carpets, his older sister was pregnant at 17 and dropped out of high school, his brother is gay and teaches aerobics in Dupont Circle (not that there’s anything wrong with that), and his baby sister started smoking meth and has been in and out of rehab and prison for the past 15 years. See what happens when you don’t let your kids trick-or-treat?

Isn't it rather odd that publishers consider the people who produce the main component of their product to be doing something else most of the time? Isn't it rather dodgy to build a multi-million dollar industry on a bunch of people whose attention is usually somewhere else? And is there any other industry that is so dismissive of its suppliers?

I knew I wanted to take a picture of it. I figured I would have to wait till it had risen high enough in the sky to clear the trees surrounding my house and neighborhood. I'm kind of in a low spot. Last year when the super moon appeared in March 2011, I could see how spectacular it was as it rose just barely peeking through the trees but by the time I could get a clear shot at it, it had lost it's bright red color and was a bit smaller.
Even at that age I remember not expecting that particular answer since it would have been so much more fun to have gotten him into trouble.

I was mulling over all this today while watching the latest NCIS episode, “Recruited”, on my DVR. As is my way, I managed to find some “parable-like” reflections of my own situation in the story. It was about a murdered Navy recruiter who happened to be gay and was trying to help a possible recruit with long standing “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” issues. Bob Newhart (another “old friend”) guest starred as an Ex-NCIS Medical Examiner suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and looking to recapture his memories. I couldn’t help but be reminded of all the things I wish had never happened, and how often I’ve wished for something that could just make all those memories go away. Of course, hiding the truth from both myself and others, and then resorting to “mind-altering substances” when that didn’t work, is why I’m where I am today.

Got seen? No problem. This is when factors beyond your control come into play. Transportation is the best route. Own a car? It's winter. "My starter wouldn't turn over for a bit. I flooded the engine and had to wait awhile till it turned" or "My car wouldn't start and I had to wait for a friend to drive over and give me a jump". Using public transit? Even better. "Traffic was terrible", "The bus just kept going and I can't afford a taxi", "My friend/family who drives me sent me a text message canceling 5 minutes before I was to leave", "The bus didn't count my change correctly and the driver said I couldn't go on even though I KNOW I had the right amount! So I had to convince the next driver to let me on".

Overall the band has a very melodic sound and is perfect for easy listening. Tape The Radio have made an exceptional debut album and are a band worth keeping an ear open for.
A lazy novel, the fast pace is provided by characters that exist for no other reason than to propel the plot. There's Corday's chatty Russian housekeeper, a talkative cop with an encyclopedic knowledge of Montreal's underworld and a rural hashslinger who likes nothing more than to listen to the police waveband. As for Yates, he's not so much Mike Garfin under a different name as a pale imitation. There's not much to him, and yet every woman, bar none, throws herself at him.
Flaxseed is chockablock full of fiber, antioxidants called lignans, and alpha-linolenic acid—an omega-3 fatty acid—one of the good fats to counteract the omega-6 fatty acids in the corn-based foods that most of us eat. (According to journalist Michael Pollan, 25 percent of the foods in the average grocery store contain corn in one form or another, such as corn syrup or corn starch.)

I came to realise that Adrienne was quite ruthless in her relationships. Before joining the Ministry she had been an Area Sales Manager for a commercial firm and I thought now that she was taking a managerial position with me. It was as if I was one of her Reps who had performed badly in his given territory and was now to be allocated a much smaller one and if I didn't like that arrangement there was always the door.

I’m now sitting on a bus stop bench near Red’s Savoy Pizza. A bus is approaching. I shake my head to politely indicate that I am not interested in the bus. I see her and her mom at the stoplight in her red Jaguar. They drive away. I fall asleep.
He held her hands in hers .”I gave you her wedding ring because I hoped you love me the way she loved me.

The 2011 car switched to a blade style roll hoop on the grounds of less weight and better airflow to the rear wing. This year the design has switched back to a deeply undercut shape, with the metal inner structure exposed beneath appearing as the four supporting struts for the engine inlet snorkel. Technical Director Andy Green explained that they were able to make this structure even lighter than the blade design. Adding that with raised nose and sidepods, losing weight high up kept the cars Centre of Gravity nice and low.

Now on to this fun challenge, As stated before this Simply Sunday Challenge Theme is Fantasy. We were asked to interpret this however we wanted, my mind immediately went to Mermaids, Unicorns and Fairies (maybe because Crew Member 2 Loves all of the Above so that's all we hear about around here). I immediately wanted to use a stamp set of Kristal's that I hadn't gotten a chance to use yet and it fit in with the theme PERFECTLY!
We are only a few days into the New Year and already we have our first case of “that b*tch done stole my song”. The good news is that for once (at least this time) it’s not Beyonce; I love her but y’all know she say’s jackin’ someone elses sh*t.
I love her so much and I hope to be with her 4ever.

“Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means; for that day shall NOT come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition.”
I read a study about children of the digital age. Some psychologists theorize that they have an inflated sense of self-image because all the "bad" pictures are deleted and they don't end up with the class pictures with the goofy grins or one eye closed. Do you keep all the digital pics of your kids or do you delete the "bad" ones?? The study said that the children of the 70's (our age) have a more realistic sense of self image because we know we can look goofy sometimes and we've grown from that. Whaddya think?

Except for a few visual and free wonders like the gorgeous flower sculptures of the Bellagio conservatory and the dancing fountains, Las Vegas serves only as a cash cow for people who itch to ditch their money. At least that’s the only head and tails I can make of it. Why would you travel to the middle of the desert otherwise, strand yourself, spend all your time in a smokey casino except for occasional breaks eating mediocre, overpriced food and downing watery $12 drinks? It sucks. I don’t see the fun part, except seeing the sheer spectacle of the it all if you happen to poke your head out of doors—which smell of alcohol and cigars even with the wind and are filled with hooded, underprivileged minorities throwing cards advertising prostitutes at you (brothels are legal there). The cards literally litter every inch of the sidewalk and I slipped on them twice.
In the morning when everybody in the world heads immediately for the toilet, The Tomboy insists that she does not need a wee. This enrages The Husband, not because she doesn't do anything, but because I ask and ask and ask "Has she done a wee yet? Has she done a wee?"

And it got me thinking about the range of possibilities for this brave new world of stem cell technology. I mean, would it be possible to coat the hats of bald men and then, when they got home and took off their hat and said, “Hi Honey, I’m home!”would he look like high-achieving entrepreneurial go-getter, Homer Simpson in the Dimoxinil episode? Or would his wife stab him with a kitchen knife thinking that he was a homicidal intruder? I don’t think science ever really considers all the possible consequences.

I'm one of those readers who needs to jump around in not only style, but temperament. Too many melancholy or dark books can often push me in to dark place so some levity needs to be injected every now and again. Jasper Fforde can always delivery the laughs with his trademark wit and turn of phrase and while Shades of Grey is not as light-hearted as his past books there is still plenty to snicker at. Gail Carriger's Alexia always seems to get herself in outlandish situations, but it is her dialogue both internal and external that brings the wit to no end. If you can get through a Parasol Protectorate novel without laughing you've got issues. Martinez is getting to be known as the American Pratchett. While I still wouldn't put him at the same level he sure can create some odd circumstances placed in a reality close to our own and fill them with amusing and breezy language.

Marcel was a great neighbor and I hope he felt the same way about me. He was kind, generous, smart, loving and full of life. He had a terrific sense of humor and a nice sense of style. He would have been a wonderful father and I’m sure he was a great husband. I feel blessed to have had him in my life for the nine years I’ve been in St. Remy.

My family is very grateful for the donor who saved mine, and I can now live a full, healthy life because of that single gift.

I was up until one last night planning out my day. I blame it on the pregnancy. There's this thing called nesting that we childbearing women go through where we have an overwhelming need to get things ready for the baby's arrival. Which is still about 18 weeks away. But here's the thing, I have NEVER been a very organized person. I've always admired the woman (or man) that can fit every detail of their life into carefully labeled plastic bins. I don't function like that. Apparently I need chaos in order to function. I have at least five spiral notebooks laying around the house with different variations of Fire and Ice (along with my other story ideas). Sometimes (if I'm lucky) I'll stumble upon one of these magic notes and figure writing stuff out, other times (more often than not) I'll spend a good hour tearing my house apart searching for the elusive cure to my writer's block. This is wasteful time, people. And if you have kids, you know that an hour of searching can easily turn into an all day thing.

And after all the effort made the past three days, and the lives lost in service to the planet, the nuclear weapons removed from Santa Monica Bay and Osaka, the destroyed base in Oaxaca, the battles over Turkey and Mexico, and between Mercury and Venus, people still say, “Well, when is it going to happen?” after many good aliens, White Hats, White Dragons, Brethren and Sisters of the White Robe, eliminated many threats…you people still want horror to gratify a base thirst.
“There are all kind of body types. Some are obsessed to lose weight, but some are naturally thin and it’s not easy for them to put on weight. I am naturally lean,” she told adding that she eats constantly.
Each one of these products are made with all natural oils and butters making these products different then anything else you will find on the shelf. When I visited The Homestead Company site I decided to read the testimonials from their customers and found that everyone loved the products and had such great results. I have added a few of the testimonials for each of the products.
There were moments that brought a lump to my throat (but no, I didn't cry, in case you're wondering). And I sat grinning like the sad little fool that I am for the last ten minutes. You know the feeling when you see David Tennant sprint with such purpose, vault over things to get to what he needs to do, and slowly spread his Tom-Baker-esque grin out for all to admire, that something brilliant is happening. And in this case, I don't see how people couldn't have enjoyed this - it was a very Doctor Who ending - he couldn't let everyone die. No matter what happened, everyone still had to be saved.

Rather, they believe they have adapted her description of the Chinese parenting style – to protect their children “by preparing them for the future, letting them see what they’re capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits and inner confidence that no one can ever take away.”
DISCLAIMER: I am not saying I have proven anything here about which parenting style is best. I'm just saying the studies like this one are faulty. I would love to see a real study done with a group of actual permissive parents. Here is an article with a list that seems to support permissive parenting (but don't bother taking the quiz).
The Belgians treated me kindly and took me all over the immediate area. We visited Antwerp, and under the statue of the hero Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant Antigoon‘s hand and threw it into the Scheldt River, we ate chocolates molded in the form of hands. We tiptoed around Madurodam, a miniature model of a Dutch town in The Hague. We drank many, many cups of cappuccino and countless pints of framboise (Belgian lambic raspberry beer) and we ate numerous plates of steak frites and croque-monsieurs. We trudged through pouring summer rain in southeast Belgium to visit Reuland Castle (on that particular day, I was wearing jeans and Capezio flats with suede soles. I was not a happy camper). We dropped in on The Family Grandma, somewhere in the Belgian outback; to my consternation I discovered that she kept ferrets. We drove out to a neighbor’s farm — he raised sheep and in the dark cloudy afternoon he caught one and wrestled it to the ground just so I could dig my fingers in the wool and feel the lanolin.

3 3/4 out of 5 – Ease of read – Crown of Horns is just as good as it is full of issues. It has trouble making fluid transitions between scenes, and there are some parts of the book that feel just plain stale on paper. On its better half, though, book nine is a reasonably entertaining finale for the saga, with enough violence, enough humor, and enough role modeling and positive messages to make for a good bang. On its worse half, we all think we could’ve gotten a better finale.
Many of you have asked how the process is going on the house facelift. Far from being done but I thought it might be fun to share the process so far. I hope you won't get bored with all the pictures but they show just how much needed to be done.

To make whiskey, the distillers mash grains with with hops and allow it to ferment. The distillers then distill the beer into whiskey. I suspect that Sour Mash Beer was made from this mash.
And in the midst of all this inactivity and aloe vera face-painting (one of the home remedies for facial scars I found on a site I googled this morning), I made cookie batter. I folded laundry that I purposely scorched in the dryer so I could bury myself under a hot pile of it. And I spent an hour and a half standing over the stove making caramels while I listened to Coldplay's "Paradise" on repeat.

As a preschooler I can remember being taken into town to The Shrine of Remembrance on St Kilda Road rugged up in tartan dressing gown and Grosby slippers. As a schoolboy I can recall learning about the birth of the ANZAC legend and the forging of the Nation’s identity in fire on the shores at Gallipoli. I remember learning of my Poppa’s exploits in Papua New Guinea during WWII and how he made a good earn putting his Melbourne City Council skills to good use recycling military leftovers into souvenirs.

The Book Spot is an amazing indy bookstore in Round Rock. They're the kind of cozy bookstore where you can hang out and read, talk books with the owners and other customers, or even just pet their adorable dogs who wander around the store.

You can pay by credit card, PayPal or Google wallet.

This woman had lost her companions. They were jogging up the mountain ahead of us. It was too fast for the woman to follow. We discovered that she had asthma. The woman came up from Phoenix and she was not used to hiking at this elevation. She held two ski poles to assist her on the terrain. The woman was in good physical shape and stopped a lot on the trail. I usually like to call these stops, “admiring the view,” rather than admit that my chest is heaving and my legs hurt.
After that was settled we reviewed the CPS paperwork and are forced to find someone to take the children. There was also two older child in the house as well.

The pairing is the first in a what the publisher has dubbed a “major” new series, in which it will team modern authors with Austen’s six novels, asking them to reimagine the books in a contemporary setting. The project is the latest addition to the current vogue for Austen remixes, which have ranged over recent years from the unexpected success of Seth Grahame-Smith’s zombie mash-up Pride and Prejudice and Zombies to erotic fiction author Mitzi Szereto’s X-rated Pride and Prejudice: Hidden Lusts.

But it was only when I started planning that I realised every decent B&B was indeed occupied or they all needed a minimum of 3 days stay on a long weekend (Bank holidays as we call it here). It still didn't stop me, and I spent my entire time researching and sending out emails to such extent that when I received replies, I was thoroughly confused as to which B&B it was and where, which- thanks to my poor organisational skills- I hadn't bothered to document. So it was double the job, going back and figuring out where it was etc etc.

When I read that there are conservative mucketymucks (FEMALE mucketymucks to boot!) who are claiming that funding for anti-domestic violence education, shelters for battered women, or any of the other provisions covered by the Violence Against Women Act were a ploy to put money in “feminist coffers” and to boost hatred of men, I was flabbergasted.

It reminds me of when I studied here in ’93: running from a bar at the end of the night to try to catch the last train before 1 a.m. Taking the train to my literature or feminism class. One night, a guy I knew and I sat on the platform, swigging rum from a flask, until we were drunk enough to make out for hours. (Classy, I know.) Amazing that certain smells can conjure such memories.

That would be poor people your Ken doll of a husband Willard made poor by buying up corporations then putting them out of work, usually just before Christmas, while outsourcing their jobs to China or liquidating the company. Poor people sometimes work, sometimes two or more jobs (when there were jobs, not that you'd have any insight into that), just to keep a roof over their heads and food on the table. They usually don't have rich industrialist/Governors/HUD directors as fathers to bail them out when their stock portfolio gets a little thin.

Yesterday with our 4-H group we took a cold winter walk at a nearby park. At the park we stopped at the playground which has a really cool log cabin structure for kids to climb. Aiden, who is my daredevil, was walking across the beams without a care in the world. I on the other hand was bracing myself because only a few days before we had to take him to the ER to get 9 stitches on a 2cm gash in his cheek. Despite my worries he was having a good time.
These "beds within the border region" are managed with Wal-Mart-like efficiency. Indeed, making beds "available quickly is considered an advantage in the industry since the government’s need for prison space is often immediate and unpredictable. Decisions about where to detain an immigrant are based on what is nearby and available. Immigration officials consider the logistics and cost of transportation to the detention center and out of the country."

Definitely in a consolidation phase. After two years I've a fair amount painted up and while I do have plenty more minis and terrain to paint up I intend to take a break from the most of it. I will get the Colours sorted on all of my painted units before setting it aside completely. I think next year Gharak and I will come back to gaming Napoleonics and I'll be enthused to pick up the brushes again.
So I busted out my new bright denim pants and wore it by an outfit inspired by this post. I can't tell you enough how much I love these pants and want to wear them all the time, however, bright aqua pants are pretty obvious and people will notice if I wear them twice a week. LOL. I'm still on the hunt for some hot pink ones, they'll be fabulous for summer!

These are big bulky items. I purposely advertised that they were "buyer collect" only. When I checked my emails I saw that I'd received an email from Paypal saying that they'd received £800. The email text says quite clearly that I could send the items. I arranged with ny buyer that he would send a courier to collect the speakers the next day, and sure enough I had a call to say they were on their way, so I left work and met the courier at home.

This is true. However, the left-wing establishment tends – willfully or otherwise – to conflate tory collectivism with socialism. This is because they interpret Canada’s traditionally conservative political culture through the prism of post-1960s Canadian identity.

Amongst the fancy cakes lie a great number of sweet breads, fluffy and yeasty like a nice brioche. Keep digging a little further...and you just might end up with my favorite of all desserts: the bean-filled cake. I suspect these are more widely available in the North, where bean cakes are a specialty. Would you believe me if I said that these were so good we went back three times? Does that even surprise you coming from me? Probably not, seeing as that I also eat chocolate about four times a day.

We start out as a sum of our life experiences, which continues until we recapitulate our lives, come up with our life stories and then start out consciously on a path of awakening. It is said by psychiatrists and psychologists, sociologists and others charged with understanding the human mind, intention and causality, that our early life is important and the things that happen to us then often stay with us for the rest of our lives. If they are negative events then they can affect us negatively as we seek to find some resolution or way to reconcile them in our minds and experiences.
