Michael Haag: I already had a pretty good knowledge of the history, the landscape and the architecture of the Crusader period; writing about the Templars brought things into sharp focus. I have traveled widely throughout the Middle East and have visited every Crusader and Arab castle of significance, including the Templars' last redoubt at Sidon in Lebanon, their fortified city of Tortosa and their castle at Safita. I've also been to the Hospitaller's great castle of Krak de Chevaliers and the Assassins' eyrie at Masyaf, all in Syria, not to mention the Temple Mount in Jerusalem where the Templars had their headquarters, the mount itself giving the knights their popular name (properly they were the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon).

Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who visited Venezuela last week, announced that five of Russia's biggest oil companies are looking to form a consortium to increase Latin American operations and to build a $6.5 billion refinery to process Venezuela's tar-like heavy crude.

You can figure them out. But there are certain guys. Like Phil Hughes. I said publicly I wouldn’t want to trade Phil Hughes. I stopped trade discussion on Hughes on (Johan) Santana because he was a rare, special guy. And he’s proven that out. He’s helped us win a World Series in the bullpen, he won 18 games last year, and we have certain guys we think are potentially even better than he is. That excites us.

At the end of summer, when we packed up for them to return to college, I picked up the nice pair of scissors one friend had brought (and we had all used) and packed it with my belongings. The other friend noticed and said, "Aren't those L.S.'s scissors?" I ignored her.

The ability of extremists in Pakistan to undermine Afghanistan is proven, while insurgency in Afghanistan feeds instability in Pakistan. The threat that al Qaeda poses to the United States and our allies in Pakistan - including the possibility of extremists obtaining fissile material - is all too real. Without more effective action against these groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan will face continuing instability.
Books on my shelves are signed by Tobias Wolff, Charles Neider, Wallace Terry, Joe Paterno, Joe Nick Patoski, Bill Broyles, Chuck Patterson and Paul Woodruff. Their signatures convey strong memories of who they are or were as human beings, and what the books say about their hearts and minds. In Paterno's case, I remember us talking about a mutual friend who was an inspirational high school teacher of JoePa's and later a Jesuit colleague of mine at Fordham University: the Rev. Tom Bermingham, S.J., a truly saintly man, worldly wise. Holding that book in my hands at the height of the Penn State University/Jerry Sandusky scandal that led to Paterno's firing, well . . .

The first Timbers game I went to was actually in 2002, and among old-time Timbers fans it's a notorious game. My friend Aram was big into the Timbers and brought us to a playoff game vs. Vancouver. I spent most of the game in the beer garden, oblivious to the action on the pitch. Around the 75-minute mark we wandered over to the North End to hear what all the drums and noise were about.

Now just about every dish is influenced by the South. During a recent visit I was surprised at how bold and delicious the menu has become, starting with an appetizer that should cause a national sensation: cornmeal-crusted oysters ($13). By themselves, they would win over the most headstrong loyalist, but Rosenthal sets them on a puddle of Herbsaint-scented pureed spinach nestled in the bottom of the shell and tops them with a precise zest of preserved lemon and a square of crisp-fried bacon. It's a symphony of tastes and textures - the crunch of cornmeal, the gush of oyster liquor, the kiss of citrus, the licorice-infused spinach and the salty meatiness of the bacon.

7. JACKSONVILLE (5-11)
He died weeks before his 81st birthday in 1938, a gadfly to the last. "Funeral service?" said one childhood acquaintance. "I thought they'd just toss him off a cliff." It would have been a fitting end for a man who took pleasure in outraging "the good people" whose opinion he disdained. In order to wrest from reluctant juries acknowledgment of their kinship with the social and political pariahs who were his preferred clients, Darrow employed bare-knuckle tactics, and even close friends sometimes suspected that he was motivated as much by love of publicity as by passion for justice.

But in some quarters, the “civil rights” meme trumps everything, including self-preservation. It’s hardly “racist” to prudently note that Islamic religiosity characterized the 9/11 hijackers, Maj. Hasan and others and is used as a motivational tool by jihadis.
Prices: Appetizers/salads, $5.50 to $10.50. Entrees: $13.50 to $29.50. Desserts: $6 to $7.

dai-gle. (day'gul) v. daigled, daigling. 1. To throw one's weight around, especially a public official. 2. Especially when combined with a threat to bring in I.C.E. 3. Especially when uttered within a 15-mile radius of the Costa Mesa Jail.
Most of what scientists know about the brain and chronic stress comes from studies of rodents, whose response systems are very much like ours (perhaps disconcertingly so) and who therefore make good stand-ins for us. But rodents rarely pack their bags and head for the beach when summer rolls around, so it's harder to use them as models for vacationers.

The effort began in late 2008 when Daimler, which owns Detroit Diesel, invested $275 million in a variety of projects designed to achieve the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Challenge for Industry. The EPA certification is given to manufacturers who reduce their energy use by 10% or more within five years.
Shortly afterward, TSA personnel realized the child had not been checked individually.
Well, I wouldn't go as far as "hottie." But let's just say that Romney's creaky, off-key attempt reminds me of a much bigger problem for the GOP. When it comes to the haves vs. the have-nots, Mitt Romney is tone-deaf.
There have been some questions about the legitimacy of such telephone surveys, which rely on automated "robocalls," a method that is "untested at the very least," said pollster Mike O'Neil, head of O'Neil Associates Inc., a Tempe-based research firm.
The City Council was positive, too: It named her to the position without even considering other applicants for the job.
While I completely agree with the concept of eliminating the dollar bill in favor of $1 and $2 coins, the idea of getting rid of the penny is just plain stupid (Editorial, April 4). If one goes to the grocery store, and the total comes to $93.02, should the grocery store collect an extra 3 cents, or should it round down the price for a cash customer?
The neighborhood: Glenville and St. Clair-Superior on the East Side.

The Portland-based gas utility said it earned $29.2 million, or $1.09 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to $29.6 million or $1.11 per share in the same period last year. The company said added staffing and other cost increases drove the decline. The consenus estimate of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters was $1.05 per share for the quarter.
He worked with police to crack down on gang violence and drug dealing in the 1980s and '90s. He retired in 1995 as manager of the King (neighborhood) Facility but remains active in the community.
Retailers long have depended on electronic gadgets to drive sales during the holiday period. (Think: smartphones last year and flat-screen TVs the Christmas before.) New products during the holidays can build buzz and drive traffic to stores, which can lead to higher sales during the two-month period in which retailers can make up to a third of their annual revenue.
The crowd began chanting "We Are the 99 Percent," before switching to "You Are the 99 percent!"

Researchers collected data from another study that tracked 84,136 women, ages 30 to 55, over 26 years. They found that women who ate the highest amount of red meat were at the highest risk for heart disease.
Although made decades earlier, her images of gaunt children crying for "Brot!" (bread) and desperate workers plotting in a dark tavern echoed Depression-era bread lines. The Nazis labeled her work "degenerate" even though it ironically anticipated many of the horrors they were to inflict upon Germany; her skeletal figures are all too similar to the bony, hollow-eyed survivors of the death camps.
Goodell has said he would be fine with Parcells stepping in. Thomas liked the idea, too.

House hunters: A local couple just finished filming their star turn on HGTV's popular "House Hunters" program. Clare and Mike Cottrill had been staying in a mother-in-law suite in Stow owned by Mike's parents. They searched for their first house in Cleveland's Western suburbs, though we don't want to ruin the show's surprise by saying which one they picked.

E-mail records and other materials were obtained through open-public-records requests submitted to the governor’s office, the Office of Legislative Services, and several state agencies. Sen. Steven Oroho and Assemblyman Jay Webber voluntarily submitted e-mail records and reference materials.
After intermission came Arnold Schoenberg's symphonic adaptation of Johannes Brahms's Piano Quartet No. 1. At once scrupulously faithful and wildly imaginative, the orchestral version retains Brahms's notes but distributes them such that the original vanishes in a blaze of color.

Chancellor George Pernsteiner of the Oregon University System thinks higher education did reasonably well in this session, although it did take a $29million add-back to its budget last week. Part of why legislators had some idea of the system's importance was that other people had already figured it out: "The fact that people are enrolling in record numbers," Pernsteiner said, "had a great deal to do with the Legislature's attitude."
The outage was reported at 2:47 p.m. Response crews were able to restore power to 2,800 customers after about 50 minutes by using an alternate power circuit, and the remaining 100 customers had their power back on as of 4 p.m., said spokesman Joe Molica.
Prevailing Regrettable Theme Or Trend Of 2010
His name may be unfamiliar, but his food isn't. The 42-year-old from Upper Darby took over the restaurant chef's job a year ago, but has been with the hotel for 23 years, the latest lifer in a long line (after David Jansen and Martin Hamann) to run this thoroughbred kitchen brigade, where there are no shortcuts, and the world's best ingredients are limited only by the imagination.
The Cougars scored 27 runs in the four games, with freshman Alex McDavid (Suwanee, Ga.) and sophomore Chelsea Yankolovich (Phoenix, Ariz.) each hitting .471. Senior Lindsey Barron (Urbaba, Ill.) was right behind at .467.
I can in some ways see her point, but I do not consider it begging. Her children are grown, with children of their own, and all of these kids are now the same way.
The new policy also would allow individual schools to vary from the districtwide rules as long as teachers and parents were involved in the decision to do so. This makes good on Deasy's vow that under his administration, schools will be given the flexibility to do what works for their particular mission and their particular students.
The student was headed to her dormitory around 11 p.m. Tuesday when a man approached her near the campus parking garage and tried to convince her to walk with him to a nearby lot, school officials said.

OLYMPIA -- Gov. Chris Gregoire approved a measure this week that she expects will create thousands of jobs throughout Washington.
This beautiful building once housed an ugly newspaper printing press in a not so- genteel section of New Brunswick. Which perhaps explains why it’s such a great place to go on a first date — for inspiration, for giddy hope, for realizing future potential. Another reason is the bar, with inventive and ever-changing cocktails and its more-than-impressive wine list. To say that husband-and-wife team Betsy Alger and Jim Black have vision is to understate. Since 1983, this restaurant has been home to great expectations, and its kitchen home to many great New Jersey chefs. Today the chef is Bruce Lefebvre, who includes on his menu East Coast oysters in a lime vodka vinaigrette, black truffle ricotta gnocchi, grilled Long Island duck breast with dirty rice. For added romance, dine in the garden.

Schimek learned the retailing trade while working for such big national chains as Urban Outfitters and L'Occitane as well as the independent specialty store Composition, now closed. I Heart Denver started two years ago as a pop-up shop during Create Denver Week, selling products made by 24 artists. The store, which has been operating in donated space, now features 122 artists, who get 70 percent of the purchase price of each item sold. Sales were up 59 percent last year. Lately, Schimek has been developing more products himself, including tourist items he gets a lot of requests for, like T-shirts, shot glasses and coffee mugs.
Jim Brown, owner of Riverside Sweets, said his livelihood depends on the success of Christmas Traditions, and the Sugar Plum Fairy has been one of the big draws.

Commissioners voted unanimously in April 2008 to promote Linda Rybak in the human resources department, increasing her $48,000 salary to nearly $54,000, as part of a reorganization. The change, according to a memo to commissioners, would save nearly $20,000 because of a position vacated by a secretary.

The sundae challenge was part of the school's "Spring Fling" event to raise money for supplies, student services, equipment, books and more library hours. It was put on by the school's Student Teacher Parent Organization. The world record attempt was part of a day of family events at the Lake Forest campus from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.
To say that Akron has performed well against the MAC would be putting it lightly. Since joining the conference in 1993, the Zips have posted an overall mark of 109-18-10 (.832) against the league, including postseason play, while capturing 13 regular season titles and seven tournament championships.
Who knows why they stopped there to play in the fresh snow. Maybe it was the open glade between Oregon 46 and the river, a break in the fog, a summer memory, a first-grader's curiosity. At some point, Sgt. James Rhodes, a Clackamas County sheriff's spokesman says, Vinesa's father "turned and had a conversation with the mom. When he looked back -- boom! -- she was going down the river.
Kings defenseman Willie Mitchell, who once played with the Sedin twins, Henrik and Daniel, said the Kings need to be more aware of what the Sedins can do on the power play, a key part of the loss in Game 4. The Kings had been flawless killing penalties in the series up until that point, but Vancouver managed to score twice with the man advantage in Game 4, with Daniel Sedin making a particularly deft play on Henrik's third-period insurance goal.
The Rangers hadn't hosted a Game 7 since their Stanley Cup victory over the Vancouver Canucks in 1994, but they stayed perfect at home in deciding games — winning their fourth. New York is 4-5 overall in Game 7, and the Senators fell to 0-5.

øFTC time share resale complaints went from 819 in 2009 to more than 5,000 in 2011. Time share resale fraud is the top subject of complaints received by the Florida Attorney General's office, which saw complaints quadruple from 2009 through 2011.
But each time the Blazers responded. LaMarcus Aldridge played the role of go-to player to perfection, finishing with 26 points, and Roy and Wesley Matthews hit dagger three-pointers -- Roy with 3:26 left and Matthews with 1:34 left -- that gave the Blazers a 103-94 lead.

"We've got to play harder, play together and come out with a sense of urgency," McMillan said. "We've dropped four out of the last five, but we didn't play like we had dropped those games. ... In order for us to give ourselves a chance to win ball games, we've got to work harder."
Some folks birthdays are part of the New Year festivities, including Edmund Oudin (Jan. 2); Barbara Pollitt (Jan. 3); Robin Burke and Laura Starkey (Jan. 4). Happy birthday wishes to all!

Superior Court Judge James Hurley Monday issued a 23-page opinion on the original lawsuit filed in December by Empower Our Neighborhoods. The judge found that a petition of 347 residents' signatures collected last fall in support of the ward system was valid and sufficient to put a question on the ballot. The judge rejected the city's desired action to instead ask voters in November whether a five-member panel should decide to change the council structure.

Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who along with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton headed up the U.S. side for the annual discussions, said at the conclusion of the talks Friday that China had made "important steps" that would translate "into greater opportunities for U.S. workers and companies."
I further hope that the council looks long-term before turning to a private contractor. We are often led to believe privatization is a cure-all and that publicly run utilities are inefficient and more costly. I feel this mentality is the true reason management chose this path, and because it alleviates them of responsibility. Professionally competent management of the plant would remedy concerns over "liability."
"We knew we had to return to California," she said. San Jose is where she studied interior design from San Jose State University and when she was 23, opened Casa Casa with her mother. Her sister joined later. When children came along for the sisters, the trio decided to sell the business. Picanco stayed on as a buyer for the new owners for a year before moving to Idaho in 2006.

Steve Carroll, a former state representative hired to lobby for Zig-Zag, said he cautioned other lawmakers that the bill was not an anti-drug crusade, as it may have seemed. "This is nothing more than a market share grab," Carroll said. "It's about the almighty dollar, and not anything illegal that's going on."
And we have a more evolved beasties, too. But, of course, this is the city, so our animals are sightly different than you will find in the wilderness. The squirrels have taken over, especially near our park. They have attitudes, sullenly watching you walk by and not even stirring as you get close. We keep our distance as they have a look in their eye, the cold stare of a prison-hardened thug that says, "What you lookin' at? Try somethin', I dare you. I ain't cut someone all day and that sounds fun." If anyone was going to carjack us, it would be these guys.
Airlines have opposed the tax and fee disclosure requirements, arguing that car dealers and other businesses don't have to make similar disclosures.
Anthony opened with an 11-shot quarter—the last time someone took more in the first 12 minutes of a playoff game was May 15, 2006, when Richard Hamilton got 12 shots off for Detroit against Cleveland. Anthony missed all seven of the jumpers he took in Game 1 when guarded by James, then got his first one to fall on the game's first possession Monday.
He does not tell these stories to me. I get them secondhand. Mostly from Caesar, one of the pugs. Lucy is more egotistical and talks mostly about herself.
They settled their grievances in 2009. As part of that deal, Navistar took over 75 percent of Blue Diamond. Navistar continued to supply Ford with F-650 and F-750 trucks, but it controlled the pace of deliveries, dealers said.
"Many of these companies we've already had contact with," Team NEO Chief Executive Tom Waltermire said while traveling in Europe on Thursday. "The orchestra is an attraction.

The 14 percent rise in the U.S. trade deficit from February to March was the sharpest one-month increase since a 16 percent jump last May.
Protecting the poor is not a partisan issue, and balancing the budget does not have to be either. Our nation has a long, bipartisan commitment to protecting low-income safety net programs like SNAP in past deficit reduction agreements. Congress should put the nation's interests first and meet in the middle to craft policies that spur economic recovery, ensure broad and sustainable opportunity, and protect families when opportunity remains out of reach, including making sure that SNAP and food pantries are here to put food on the table until struggling Americans are back on their feet.
TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie says he has "one very solid lead" as a result of his trip to Chicago last week to try to lure businesses back to New Jersey.
"He's getting comfortable with the game," said Abdul-Jabbar, who played four years in high school and four in college while Bynum played only two years of high school basketball before going pro. "I was a seasoned veteran compared to him. All the success you see him have comes about with him consolidating his knowledge of the game and gifts of the game."
But his cart bears no cookies. No juice, either. These days the cookie man brings baked wheat crackers, Goldfish and Teddy Grahams, plus milk, water and coffee. Treats for parents and staff, but mostly for the patients.
For their part, many students say they don't mind working without pay—at least, for the moment. "The experiential learning is more valuable than the money at this point," says Nicole Quesada, a McCombs student with a chemical-engineering background who is working on Yoo-hoo.

AKRON, Ohio -- Former Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora asked a federal judge Wednesday to consolidate two corruption cases pending against him, and to give him more time to prepare for the trial.
Feliz followers will note, of course, that Domingo is one of Spinner’s best plates from the Cantina. But consider it a sign: of a chef who’s found his own voice, and even a few greatest hits. As the city crowd gets to rediscover this notable young talent once again, now well out from his mentor’s shadow, the spotlight should only grow brighter.
Goodell all but posted a five-point plan for Williams to follow to gain re-admittance to the NFL before the 2013 season. Goodell clearly wants Williams to take a positive and proactive role in speaking to high school players and coaches, college players and coaches, and youth football players and coaches.
Opener: Davy Knowles.
Like the persona Frankel reveals on her reality TV shows and in her books, Faith has a tough exterior but reveals sensitivity and insecurity underneath the bravado. At some points it seems Frankel is using Faith to work through her own personal issues.
McBean, Arena said, will not go into residency with the U-17 team in Bradenton, Fla. Once the tournament in Montego Bay is over, McBean will return to Newport Beach and train with the Galaxy.

Economic development? Brown replied that he favors investing in infrastructure and cited the January power failure at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, which is run by the city.
Travel companies are constantly innovating and pushing the boundaries, and if they can figure out a way to nudge you into making an online purchase while not breaking the law, they'll try. I can't see what's behind the firewalls of the usual suspects - the discount airlines and tour operators whose business models depend on deception - but I wouldn't put anything past them.
More than just the sense of touch issues (the stickiness of sweat, itching of bug bites and pain of sunburn), summer is an assault to all my senses.
And often, if not always, the amiably priced cuisine provides its own bursts of color, explaining why Cabezon tends to fill up even on weekdays.
Pictures of the baker and his creations line the walls, his family argues on monitors, but for customers in search of a memory not a cannoli to take home, there's an autographed, life-sized cardboard cutout in the corner. And seven hours a day, seven days a week, he's not going anywhere.
That's the hallmark of Longworth's sterling production. It's very traditional - no updates, no gimmicks, no "concepts." The director and his excellent design team (all theater artists based in St. Louis) seem to be working from two reasonable assumptions about the most important group in the theater, the audience. One: People have not seen this play so often that a traditional approach will seem old hat. Two: People can understand the play on its own, 16th-century terms, without bending over backwards for relevance.
JaVale McGee added 16 points, 15 rebounds and three blocks for the Nuggets, who lost forward Al Harrington to a fractured nose in the third quarter. Danilo Gallinari and Andre Miller both scored 13 and Kenneth Faried finished with 12 points and 15 rebounds.
Salmon salad ($15) is a misnomer because it's mostly salmon and very little salad. The star is a log of smoked salmon rolled pinwheel fashion around cream cheese, arranged next to dressed herbs that mimic the shape of the salmon. Above the roll are a salmon cake and two little bagel wedges smeared with salmon salad. It's another example of a creative treatment of a steak house standard.

According to our unscientific study, the entrant with the most on the line Saturday is Went the Day Well. When its owners paid $850,000 to buy the horse, they knew what they were doing: They include the syndicate Team Valor, which won the Derby last year with Animal Kingdom. But so far, Went the Day Well has only won a little over $315,000—barely enough to qualify for the Derby field. Even if the horse wins Saturday, it still may need to win more this summer to recoup its investment—or to get a start on its stud career. "I stuck my neck out on this one. I think it's worth it," said Team Valor president Barry Irwin.

Reister had five years earlier mistakenly fired a loaded riot-suppression launcher during training, striking an officer posing as a protestor with a smoke round. Reister was a "grenadier" training as part of the Police Bureau's Rapid Response Team in October 2006 when he fired a less-lethal TL-1 launcher loaded with a smoke round at an officer posing as a rioter who threw a projectile at Reister's unit. Reister pulled the trigger of his gun to simulate firing, but his firearm was loaded with a smoke round that struck Officer Zach Kenney in the leg, causing a minor bruise. Reister had forgotten he had loaded a live smoke round in the chamber and admitted he had made a mistake, court papers show. The bureau gave Reister a letter of reprimand for the 2006 error.

And then there are the cap-strapped Steelers, who took care of some big needs they aren't able to address in free agency. They watched two talented linemen in guard David DeCastro and tackle Mike Adams fall into their laps in the first two rounds. Linebacker Sean Spence will be a nice fit in their stable of linebackers. Chris Rainey bring explosiveness to the return game. And Alameda Ta'amu could be the successor to Casey Hampton as nose tackle.

The way Crawford sees it, Saturday figures to be the first of many positive impressions he leaves on Portland. But he wasn't talking about zip-passes, three-pointers or spin moves.

Changes this large impose consequences. Since prehistoric times, up to 250,000 walrus have moved northward each summer into the Chukchi Sea, following retreating sea ice. There, off the northern coast of Alaska, walrus feed on clams in the seabed, resting on ice between their dives. Female walrus nurse their young on the ice floes. When the ice rapidly disappeared there during the summer of 2007, thousands of walrus were forced onto land where they risked trampling deaths, predation by bears and depletion of food sources.

For me, it was very, very simple with this. This movie is about this guy and this girl. That's what it's about. Anything that services that will be in the movie. Anything that doesn't I know will end up being cut.
Sharon and Bill Reuter moved to Ridgely's Delight in 1986, before Ravens perched a few blocks away and before Camden Yards evoked anything more than a faded industrial past.
We thought the week before the holiday would be a fine time to tour the park -- but did not anticipate a winter that produced twice as much snow as normal. The road through Dunraven Pass, buried under 20 feet of snow, was not cleared until June 8, and some campgrounds and trails were not accessible until the end of June.

The Clippers, who held the Thunder to 25 points in the second half, earned a playoff berth earlier in the evening when Houston lost to Denver and will make their first postseason appearance since the 2005-06 season.
He’s no prize, either. Although Noah tells Adam how much he admires teachers, he then says, "I could never do it" — in a way that minimizes the profession. The more Deena comes to know Noah, the more appalled she is. And while Skoff may not realize it, the Noah and Deena that he’s created deserve each other. They match each other in insensitivity.
The Gresham City Council will vote April 6 on the company's application, its second since 2007, when the company won a property tax abatement for an $82 million investment.

Day 17. Getting your AARP card and a gout diagnosis—that is one bad quarter-hour. Jane came back without a word, around half past four. For a time we were excited to be together again. We would cross the park hand in hand. Now she feels "lost," mutters about "irreconcilable differences," appears to have come unglued. "How am I going to have my career while living in Minnesota?" she cries out. I wouldn't worry about it, I say, unless and until we are living in Minnesota. Terrible screams and the tearing of hair, our own and each other's. At night, shuddering, sibilant recriminations.

Two days after Julian's body was found, police discovered a .45-caliber gun nearby that would later be tied to the slayings. Balfour's girlfriend told authorities she saw a gun in Balfour's possession that looked like the murder weapon. Police found no prints on the weapon's magazine but were still testing the gun's grip, according to sources. Police are also testing gloves found in one of Balfour's pockets for gunshot residue.
WASHINGTON -- Within the last week, authorities say, Amine El Khalifi's plan was proceeding: An al-Qaida associate handed him an automatic weapon to kill security officers inside the U.S. Capitol. A bomb-laden vest would detonate in the building. He would die as a martyr.
Though he is far from a lock to reach the Hall of Fame, Posada’s career has been strong enough to warrant consideration, which will generate plenty of conversation about his credentials. He hit .273 with 275 home runs and 1,065 RBI, all while slugging .848.After splitting time with future manager Joe Girardi, Posada, a swith-hitter, eventually took control of the Yankees’ catching job in 1999, a position he kept until the Yankees pushed him into a designated hitter role last season.
Despite a rough beginning to the season that included a 0-8 start on the road and an air of ongoing tension between Skiles and Stephen Jackson — which finally ended when Jackson was included in the trade with the Warriors, who subsequently sent him to San Antonio — the Bucks were beginning to play well just before the Bogut trade. Then they went on a run, winning four straight at the beginning of April to run their record to .500 and making the playoffs look like a realistic possibility.

Likewise, the suggested bias against “American Idol” contestants kicks in long before the nominees are established. Performers from “Idol” don’t get the opportunity to compete in the top categories because none of the voters will list them. I don’t think that the show has been blackballed. I think we’re seeing another instance of the Grammy Awards’ distaste for pure pop.
"Our role focuses on how the money was raised, spent and managed," said the official. Officials at the planning agency, Chongqing Development and Reform Commission, couldn't be reached to comment.

If the rematch between the arch-rivals in the House of Pane was, say, on Saturday the two teams would not only fill the stadium to overflowing and have people dangling from nearby rooftops but they could probably split a pretty good Pay-Per-View gate as well with a closed-circuit telecast at local theaters.

There are pockets with hardscrabble neighborhoods, but, close to South Mountain, goats and horses graze a few blocks from luxury homes.
Many companies are hesitant to pass along the added costs to the consumer, who is coping with 8.8 percent unemployment and slow job growth. Instead, the higher prices are squeezing profit margins.

"We stand today with only one choice: Pay the ransom now or pay more ransom later," said Rep. Brad Sherman of California. "This is not a place Democrats want to be.

The deejay hosted a question and answer session with Clemons after the April 2011 Asbury Park premiere of “Who Do I Think I Am?,” a documentary concerning Clemons’ life. Cunningham recalls that Clemons, although in pain, kept on smiling. “He stood there with some help from his crutches and answered every question and signed everything he could,” said Cunningham. “He fed off the crowd’s energy. And as much of a struggle as it was for him, he did it all graciously.

Stock-futures erased losses after a report showed that claims for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S. unexpectedly fell last week, signaling the recent slowdown in payroll gains is due to a lack of hiring rather than more firings. Applications for jobless benefits decreased 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April, the Labor Department said. Economists forecast 405,000 claims, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.

When he announces that he plans to do Usher's "U Got It Bad," my first thought: What is he thinking? But when he starts singing, soulful and moody, it's just revelatory. He completely owns the song and makes you forget the original. Think of what David Cook did with "Billie Jean," and you've got an idea of just how good Phillip is here. The judges all agree.

Metro East school officials are trying to figure out how they'll meet the terms of proposed state legislation that would change personal health courses.
Though employers have run more than 2.2 million checks, the number of verified employees is smaller because of the likelihood of multiple checks.

Maybe Mr. Zimmerman had no business following Trayvon or asking him what he was doing — although, arguably, that's what neighborhood watch volunteers are supposed to do — but that would not justify Trayvon physically attacking Mr. Zimmerman.

The Army is slated to shrink by 80,000 troops, more than any other service. But Odierno points out that the Army also grew more than any other branch of the armed forces during the last decade.

Tustin residents LeRoy and Winona Katnik visited TJ Maxx/HomeGoods on opening day.
The results are astonishingly good, and, like that spectacular branzino, it's a showman's dish, which explains why the 27-year-old chef -- mature beyond his years -- was tapped to compete last year on the Food Network's "Iron Chef America" (he lost to perennial favorite Masaharu Morimoto, and he was robbed). Since the too-brief sweet corn season is already drawing to a conclusion, you'd better hurry in. Fast.
The Giants cannot address Umenyiora's situation until the lockout is over, at which point they'll decide whether to retain him while also attempting to re-sign fellow defensive end Mathias Kiwanuka, who is scheduled to be a free agent.
