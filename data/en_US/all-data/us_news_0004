The Baltimore region not only has a number of outstanding parks and the internationally known Inner Harbor, with its outstanding public walkway, but also a system of protected open space, both public and private, that is arguably more impressive than that in Boston, Chicago and most other major metropolitan areas. Yet, it is not generally recognized, appreciated or marketed as a regional resource. The area to which I refer needs a name; I would call it the Baltimore Greenbelt. A greenbelt is defined by the Webster's dictionary as a belt of parks or farmland around an existing community.
Get life support, stat!: If "Pushing Daisies" was a pleasant surprise, "Private Practice" was the opposite. This "Grey's Anatomy" spin-off came with great expectations, considering it featured a stellar member of the "Grey's" ensemble, Kate Walsh (as Dr. Addison Montgomery). But Addison's adventures as a doc at an L.A. clinic were a conpendium of cliches about Southern Cal. Plus, Dr. Montgomery seemed to have left her chops in Seattle. See for yourself on this first season collection. The writers' strike also called an early halt to this one, so maybe season two will be an improvement. Not rated; 394 min.

Mr. Obama was different. He had that cool name. He was black. He'd never done much that was important, save give some fun speeches, but that was OK; neither had most college students, and that didn't keep them from being special either.

The author's personal engagement with this material gives punch to his conclusion: "Carnegie's presuppositions also point to depressing aspects of the American system, which values success over sincerity, individualism over community. . . . Carnegie just assumes (unconsciously) that he is dealing with a world of pathological narcissists" -- a regrettably apt description of modern America at its worst.

Whenever I get the chance to show love to a Diplomats member — whether it's a lowly alum like Un Kasa or the king of kings himself, Cam'ron — I'm going to do it. This is because the Diplomats (better known as Dipset) will go down as one of the best rap cliques of all time, a distinction that, at least for me, requires no second-guessing. It was the Dips' timeless hits, outsized personalities and the insane Harlem flair they brought to everything they did that made them rap's hottest crew for a few years. Before rappers were yelling "Swag!" every 15 seconds, the Diplomats did it without the tiresome reminding. It was just always there.

One breakdown by Collinsworth I didn’t like was when he questioned S Kenny Phillips on Robinson’s 34-yard touchdown in the third quarter. It was against a Cover-2 look and Phillips had two receivers coming at him. One was WR Miles Austin in the slot, who wasn’t rerouted by Rolle. Phillips had to honor Austin, which is why he was late to get to Robinson. I wouldn’t blame him there. If I had to point to where the coverage could improve, I’d say Rolle could’ve influenced Austin a bit more and CB Corey Webster could’ve sunk deeper and more quickly because there was no threat in the flat. However, it’s also a great throw and catch as well.

In addition to preparing ourselves, we need to prepare our children. It's a difficult conversation to have, and it is one we must learn to undertake. One of the better suggestions I've heard in the wake of the Penn State scandal is that children shouldn't just have one or two parents they feel safe going to for help. They should have five "safe adults," and if one does not help, they can go to the next.
Add complex brightness. Acidity gets the attention of your taste buds, which is why we like things like mustard, pickles and even ketchup. Regular yellow mustard can be brash without being interesting. Try one that brings more to the party. A dijon brings heat, honey mustard brings sweetness, whole grain brings texture. Pickles come in many varieties, too, and try other vegetables pickled like fennel or onions.

By contrast, on the Continent, where many constitutions date all the way back to the disco era (Greece, 1975; Portugal, 1976; Spain, 1978), if the establishment wants to invent a new "right" – i.e., yet another intrusion by government – it goes ahead and does so. If it happens to conflict with this year's constitution, they rewrite it. The United States is the only Western nation in which our rulers invoke the Constitution for the purpose of overriding it – or, at any rate, torturing its language beyond repair.

And everyone can find medical care in an emergency. This is not enough. But it is a set of blessings not available to half the people in the world. We must count our blessings.

I'm a little disappointed. Like most Cardinal fans, I would've loved to see Albert finish his career as a Cardinal. But how can anybody criticize a player for doing what's best for him and his family? In the long run, this is probably better for all concerned; like most, I was really worried about how much a huge 10-year contract was going to hamstring the organization going forward. Should make for a real interesting 2012.

This represents a breakthrough in the long-simmering animosity between conservative and liberal Catholics over how much the church should have changed in the wake of Vatican II.

When the clerical sex-abuse scandals surfaced in 2002, conservative Catholics blamed a woozy post-Vatican II mind-set that signaled that anything was permissible, while liberals pointed the finger at a hidebound hierarchy desirous of sweeping unpleasant truths under the rug.

Mayor Bing has talked about achieving that but never acted on it.

Cocoa powder is dusted on top, and atop that comes a generous layer of the "sawdust" -- pulverized English-style tea biscuits. It's fattening and fabulous.

Those duck confit sandwiches begin with salted legs cooked overnight until tender. When Bittner, 31, mingles earthy meat with her delicate apricot sauce and homemade onions, you taste her feel for balance and nuance. Ham and cheese vaults beyond the ordinary here with lean, flavor-popping meat, sharp gruyere and creamy Oregon butter. But the real find may be the house riff on Spanish bread and chocolate: a toasted baguette oozing dark, melted Scharrfen Berger, the piercing crunch of fleur de sel and a sauve hint of olive oil.
But there is plenty of music in Marley, including exquisite alternative takes of early, essential songs. What also comes across is how, while life in the Marley camp was chaotic and ganja-fogged, he held to his core beliefs. His songs espoused freedom, love, and equality, and so, too, did his actions. Marley became a wealthy man in the last years of his life, but he gave much of his money away - people would queue up at the gates of his Kingston compound, and they would leave with cash.
Long delays should turn even loooonger over the coming weeks as crews start a project to install a new traffic signal system at the highway exit area along the border of Willowick and Wickliffe.

She noted the Food and Drug Administration has said it has prevented more than 100 new shortages in 2011.

That's apparently how too many NBA players feel about playing against World Peace. Talk about someone's who's acted erratically. And needs anger management courses. Remember, he drew that whopping 86-game suspension back in 2004 for his role in the wild brawl in the Palace at Auburn Hills during that Indiana Pacers-Detroit Pistons game. And all told, he's been suspended 13 times for 111 games during his NBA career.

However, career counseling can lower those numbers. In fact, it's not a bad idea to start looking at career options as early as your junior or senior year in high school. Check with your guidance counselor about career assessment tools and job shadowing opportunities that can help you narrow your degree focus before you even set foot on a college campus. And, when you get to campus be sure to engage the services of the university's career counseling staff.

Its registered voters make up just 2.2 percent of the 10-county region, less than any other county. There’s a stopgap in place, however, with the regional roundtable, which will craft the final project list.

A: Oh yeah, absolutely. I'm not worried about results so much anymore. I was going through that slump there for a while and worrying about results and pressing and wanting to stay in the lineup and thinking I could only stay in the lineup if I could hit. All that negative thought process just buries you even more. I quit worrying about that about a week ago and the results came. I got a few hits in a game, a few RBIs and stuff. In the grand scheme of things looking back, I don't even worry about that anymore. The numbers are going to be what they are at the end of the year. They're not going to be terrible, they're not going to be the best in the league. I'm not worrying about it, I'm just trying to get a routine down and stick with it.

In general, low-budget films stand to benefit the most proportionately by winning because they have received less hype and exposure, the report said. Last year’s winner, "The Hurt Locker," reaped $17 million in box office receipts and cost just $11 million to make.

The Knicks could have brought their best game to Miami, but they still would have lost Game 2, because they are hopelessly overmatched. The Heaters were sharp Monday night. They moved the ball brilliantly. Dwyane Wade had his legs, that flubbed dunk notwithstanding. Mario Chalmers hit game-busters. Chris Bosh was remarkably efficient. LeBron James had an And-One party.

Mr. Rodricks also notes the Social Security contributions and taxes illegal aliens pay and subsequently don't collect. Since they are working in low-paying jobs, I doubt much money goes into the U.S. Treasury.

SHEA McCLELLIN: ‘‘Marginal weight-room strength - managed only 19 reps of 225 pounds on the bench press at the Combine.

Questionable Calls: Kendricks was a worthy pick, but his short stature may not be ideal to playing as a SAM linebacker that often has to cover much taller tight ends.

There are particles of less than 10 microns in size and diameter (PM10), which are inhalable. But those are considered coarse and pretty big particles in terms of what you can breathe in.

The passage of SB 1070 may have been inevitable. Arizonans are fed up over the federal government's foot-dragging in bringing about the kind of immigration reform that secures the southern border, deals with those individuals who are already in the country illegally and gets serious about how to handle those immigrants who will come here in the future.

With a statewide unemployment rate hovering just south of 10 percent, our state's leaders need to regain focus at this critical time. Arizona has to get back to work.
