This is disturbing, though not in the way Beinart intends. Many people form their views of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on snapshot impressions, often shorn of the most basic context. That's a shame, but at least most of these people don't go on to write books on the subject.

Entrees sampled included perfectly crisp and moist fried chicken glazed with honey, not-too-spicy blackened catfish, moist and meaty pork chops and a shrimp-and-grits dish studded with bits of onion, red pepper and black beans swimming in a satisfying Creole country gravy.

Johnson did, however, know how to use the presidency. Almost half the book covers the 47 days between the assassination and Johnson's Jan. 8 State of the Union address. In that span he began breaking the congressional logjam against liberal legislation that had existed since 1938 when the nation, recoiling against Franklin Roosevelt's plan to "pack" the Supreme Court, produced a durable congressional coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats.

Damon, Johansson, and Fanning are such naturals that for long passages the contrivances of the screenplay by Crowe and Aline Brosh McKenna are not apparent. But the filmmakers insufficiently stir the lumpy metaphors, chief among them that for animals, as for humans, there is a difference between cages and enclosures. A cage inhibits movement and growth, not so an enclosure, which has boundaries but permits circulation and interaction with others.
Cozumel may be inundated with cruise ships and tacky souvenir shops, but it's still my favorite destination for diving, snorkeling and people-watching in the plaza at sunset. Just 12 miles east of the Yucatán Peninsula, the 290-square-mile island has the feel of a small Mexican-Mayan town once the day trippers sail away. Its underwater marine park (one of Mexico's first underwater parks) incorporates part of the Great Mesoamerican Reef, the second-longest barrier reef on the planet.
A: Growth in overall health care costs, including spending on the huge Medicare and Medicaid programs, is out of control, said Robert Laszewski, president of consultants Health Policy and Strategy Associates.

A: Oh, it's still very confusing. Fortunately, we have some pretty great organizations that can guide you. Autism Speaks is one of them. They have 100-day kits for the first 100 days after a diagnosis for what you can do. And they have a lot of community resources and a database on their web site. You have organizations like ours, HollyRod, which gives compassionate care to families. We're working really hard to erect a compassionate care center where families can go. Hopefully that will be the model that can spread across the country. The one I look at as the Holy Grail is St. Jude, where families can go and deal with their children's cancer without having to worry about paying for it. Where is the St. Jude for autism? That's in my sights, doing something like that.

Met first is Rachael, an ambitious artist who is Adam's girlfriend. Beautifully portrayed by Howard (who similarly devoured the part of the evil Hilly Holbrook in "The Help"), Rachael does not seem the "through sickness and health" type, but she insists she is, and even presents Adam with a canine companion (a greyhound named Skeletor who looks like death warmed over) as a sign that she has his best interests at heart.

A: Well, I think it's a very positive sign that companies like Merck and Johnson & Johnson have chosen to create early-stage technology incubators or accelerators here in the last few months. It further supports the fact that we are strong in the establishment of young companies with a base in the intellectual property that is coming out of the universities and research institutes. Merck's translational accelerator is focused specifically on moving very early technology to a level where it can be an attractive drug development candidate, either internally through Merck or as a spinoff company. Novartis has had great success here with its genomics institute creating and spinning off companies.

Let's imagine the things we assume were happening in those first three or four years. It was then that developmentally critical milestones were taking place, ones about which we remember so little.

Here, too, the hero, Walter Vale, is a blocked and lovelorn academic -- and, yes, a widower -- who teaches only one economics class at a Connecticut college, obsesses over a book he may never finish writing, and sleepwalks through his life. So much for similarities.

Freed called it "The Moondog Coronation Ball." At the concert, he said, he would be crowned officially as King of the Moondoggers.

Bear Republic Brewing Co. Red Rocket Ale ($10/six-pack, 6.8 percent): The heaviest malt of the bunch, this tastes like more of a strong ale with a creaminess approaching, dare I say, Guinness in the bottle. The malt notes are more toasty and suggestive than sweet - cocoa, roasted almond and burnt sugar, as opposed to straight-up caramel. The hops are prevalent and evenly matched, from sniff to swallow. From Healdsburg.

Early this year, the union that represents Boeing employees in Seattle and Portland, Ore., filed a complaint with the NLRB claiming that Boeing was shifting production of some its 787 Dreamliner airplanes to a factory in South Carolina.

Romney has spent the last couple of days courting moderate voters in Ohio, whose electoral votes are indispensible to any realistic prospect for his election, and Democratic-leaning Michigan, which Republicans hope to put back into play by November.

“Barney’s Version” is adapted from a novel by Mordecai Richler, and some things seem to be lost in the adaptation. For example, that murder case never really comes to anything. Barney’s loudest, liveliest wife storms off the scene — and is never heard again.

The pair performed in the round on a slowly rotating stage. It was a democratic gesture, but also a frustrating one: for half of the performance, whatever it was that you most wanted to see was in eclipse. At times, it felt like King and Taylor were riding an extremely poky tilt-a-whirl. The best seats in the house were the ones right up against the stage; alas, they were also the most expensive. But they were priced that way for a good reason -- they were offered to the public through Tickets For Charity (ticketsforcharity.com), an organization that pairs with artists to set aside hard-to-find seats at concerts. All proceeds from ticket sales go to the artist's charity of choice. Tickets For Charity will be making those seats available at the King and James show at Prudential Center on June 25.

Bin Laden's inner circle also was frustrated when, in 2010, attention in the U.S. shifted to the weak economy without apparently crediting al-Qaida for the economic damage that terrorist attacks had caused.

Even so, at the start of a new school year, the district would add more sick leave - 10 days in most recent years. Those that went unused would accumulate with no limit, and when Meisch, 66, retired this year, he had accrued 471 days at a value of more than $100,600.

Promises aside, within six months Zeaman is the sole walker. "Suburban vagabonds" Pete and John explore the wild fringes of their neighborhood. Walking the dog is a way to really see the neighborhood; and a way to meet neighbors. It grounds Zeaman, whose marriage is in a slump; it brings him closer to nature than he would ever get on his own. (Zeaman confesses that he doesn't always pick up the poop.) "If you want to know a place, find a dog and walk it," Zeaman writes. Pete never fails to lift the author's spirits: Each walk is an adventure, each return home has the level of emotion "of Odysseus catching sight of Ithaca on the horizon."

About the Blazers: The Blazers endured their worst defeat of the season Sunday, falling 121-96 to the Los Angeles Lakers. The two-time reigning champions ran circles around the Blazers as Pau Gasol finished with a triple double, seven players reached double figures in scoring and the Lakers led by as many as 29 points. Roy was held to a season-low eight points on 1-of-6 shooting in a performance that had players in the Lakers locker room wondering if he played with an injury.

Pier 1's Liliana armchair has an ironwork pattern that's recurring in textiles and furniture detail this season. The Annie Black Bird wingback chair features a dramatic black and white nature motif that would pop against dark or white walls and wood floors. And a hanging lamp in caramel with leaves rendered in gold is the perfect addition to a restful room filled with tawny hues.

For this regulars love him in return, whisper to you that they have never met anyone kinder, memorize details about him, ask after his hunting trips, even, in one case, draw him pictures. "This is for the person who drives the bus," says a little boy, his hair so blond it looks white, who has come aboard with six of his siblings while their mother waits outside -- strikingly beautiful children who eat lustily, but so politely, and yet, if you look closely there are dark circles under all of their eyes. "Thank you for the luncches," it says.
Ingram had four interceptions, 10 sacks and 15 tackles for loss in 2011. He returned two of the picks for touchdowns.

What did they discuss? And what of those questions about his campaign from recent weeks?
Wait. How is Leif being blamed for all of this mess? Now they’re going to vote him out instead of Bill? Won’t that piss off Colton? Jay is as confused as I am. Have the men forgotten that they’re playing a game? They agree that the vote must be unanimous, and hopefully some of them (not Tarzan or Colton, because they be cray-cray) will see the light.

The St. Louis caucus was relatively orderly and took fewer than two hours in the cafeteria at St. Louis Community College at Forest Park.

Police also arrested two Paul supporters during that caucus.

There is a saying: Don't judge a man until you've walked a mile in his shoes. Mr. Bales will have to live with these memories for the rest of his life, as will his family. For another American to say he should have been turned over to the Afghans is outrageous.
Maybe more of a wish than a "guarantee," but what the heck, let's have some fun. Last year, it was such a welcome breath of fresh air when JR replaced Michael Cole after Cole's match. When simply a lead announcer Cole is great, but when infused with a steady dose of villain commentary, it's a unanimous wish for silence from the WWE Universe. This doesn't need to be said, but in my opinion (and with great respect to the late Gordon Solie and the late Gorilla Monsoon), JR is the greatest wrestling commentator of all time and it would be a unanimous "welcome!" to the lead announce chair, even if it's for one match. Perhaps it would be fitting that he call the "end of an era" Hell in a Cell match. Speaking of that match ...

This is not a contest. Republicans effectively ceded the position to Lockyer when they nominated Claude Parrish, an affable and stoutly conservative member of the state Board of Equalization who has proved to be way over his head in statewide politics. Parrish is not raising much money, does not have a campaign Web site and has declined every offer to debate Lockyer -- including one from our editorial board, which we would have posted on the Internet for voters to see. Republicans missed an opportunity to compete for this office when Assemblyman Keith Richman, a moderate with a forceful presence and a determination to tackle the state's long-term fiscal issues, was defeated in the primary.

It has become clear that treatment for HIV, though still crucially important, can't solve the problem. That will only happen through preventing transmission of the virus in the first place. The goal of the prevention revolution that is finally taking off is to end the devastation of AIDS once and for all. In order for governments to have the confidence to continue making the enormous investment required to provide access to treatment to all those living with HIV, they must have reasonable assurance that one day the bill will be paid in full. That will require having ways to reliably prevent new infections.

These ideas underlie America's greatness in unspoken ways. The Scout Oath requires adherents "to do my best to do my duty to God and my country," "to help other people at all times," "to keep physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight."

My next 50 columns could be taken up with political analysis surrounding this 2,300-page monstrosity.

McMillian can't stress this enough: Leftovers are your friends. That's why a huge theme in her book is providing recipes that rely on leftovers — small amounts that might not seem like a lot but are plenty for a grade-schooler's appetite. "It's important to use those little bits and pieces; it adds up to a whole lunch for a child," she says. Her veggie sushi rolls recipe, for instance, was tested with rice from leftover Chinese takeout. Or think about that flank steak from last night's barbecue. Tuck a couple slices into a whole-wheat tortilla and send along some salsa in a plastic container.
Ed Darrow, who is developing The Cove, a residential-commercial project near the landfill, said he would not have spent the initial $2 million needed to jump-start the project had if he faced voter-approved financing. If the measure passes, Darrow warned, "you're going to push developers away."

Taking his turn to question Barnett, Clemens' lawyer Rusty Hardin tried in several ways to raise doubts about the validity of the hearing, but many of his questions were met with objections by the government or by an attorney from the House of Representatives, leading to several private conferences at the judge's bench and one debate that took place with the jury out of the room.

Once again, director Jon Favreau has surrounded Downey with really good actors. Mickey Rourke jumps on board as crazed Russian inventor Ivan Vanko (apparently allowed only one facial expression -- dour -- for the duration of the film).

An occupational therapist can also work in the schools, which I did throughout the Bay Area for 10 years. Our primary role is to provide children full access to their academic program.

In some cases kindergartners are writing in journals and expected to sit still for extended periods of time. So, my passion right now is to work with children on functional fine motor skills and self-help skills so they can fully participate in the classroom.

RB Ahmad Bradshaw. He had 659 yards rushing during an injury-plagued regular season, but had 200 yards in three playoff games. The Giants want to have offensive balance in the Super Bowl.

Turk said he doesn't see any end in sight to the regular price increases the tire makers have been charging him and other retailers.
Nathanson rejected that argument, however, saying there was no case law to support such a theory. She wrote that it "would be an absurd result to allow violent force against a sleeping individual just because the defendant perceived that individual to be a part of a larger conspiracy against him."

The production, as smoothly executed as Sullivan's lauded staging of "Proof," finds the humanity in even the smallest of roles.

There's a feeling that these flat, diagramlike structures could unfold, following the fluorescent tubes into the actual space of the viewer.

Fitting that the lowest remaining seed in the tournament gets to play a virtual home game against the second-overall No. 1-seed. But for as good as the Crimson's frontline is, Syracuse's is better.

The state will also have to work out how this agreement -- which gives no one the powers of an emergency manager or a bankruptcy court -- can possibly wrestle down Detroit's onerous debt and legacy costs. There's no way to fix the city's finances without figuring out how to make those obligations more manageable, and the solution may require big-picture thinking about how to address the issue for all local governments. Snyder hasn't wanted to deal with that before; he will have no choice in Detroit.
The City Council had tried to muscle in on the process of fixing the city's chaotic finances, which had been run by Thompson, who is backed by the state and Gov. Tom Corbett. The council had argued that filing for bankruptcy would be fairer to the city's taxpayers, as it would give the city more control over how it pays off its creditors.

Ogden maintains that his personal layovers have not cost the city extra. He frequently submits a printout from the travel website Orbitz.com as an expense quote or provides other estimates for his travel. However, no one verifies that those estimates are the lowest cost available at the time of the trip.
City officials have suggested offsetting budget shortfalls partially by asking workers to forgo these raises but the union bosses are crying foul. Councilwoman Jan Perry, via phone, said the raise issue will come down to a simple question for the unions: "Do you want to save jobs for more people or raises for fewer people?" If the union is unwilling to give up the raises, layoffs appear imminent, diminishing the city's workforce.

Two experienced conservative appellate judges, Lawrence Silberman and Jeffrey Sutton, cited those recent precedents in upholding the Obama health law.
So I did what countless travelers do every day. I hid my questionable purchase in my carry-on tote and "forgot" to mention it on the customs declaration form. But I fretted over my contraband the entire flight home and sweated through the customs line at the airport in San Francisco. In the end, the customs agent waved me through with hardly a glance. My beans and I were home free.

So the fact that "Grimm" -- an NBC series coming to Friday nights this fall -- is filming on location in Portland isn't groundbreaking news. The concept, on the other hand, is off the beaten track -- it's about a Portland homicide detective who's descended from a long line of "Grimms."
It remains to be seen how Rosenblum's unflinching support of Oregon's medical marijuana law will play with voters. The candidates each released some polling data Tuesday that showed themselves in the lead.

After all this medieval and prehistoric architecture, I was ready for the seashore. Walking to Dwerja, on Gozo's west coast, I found the road suddenly open onto the wide bay and then swerve down to its rocky beach, where waves washed through the Azure Window, a crowd-pleasing and oft-photographed stone arch that juts out into the sea.
"It showed that he clearly had no idea of the devastation and the levees ruined up and down the river," she added.
No, what I like is a jumble of the tangible and the intangible, of beauty and ugliness, that somehow sets me a-tingle: the sinister proximity of big things, and the smokestacks on hinges, pulled down as the boats go under the bridges; the glimpse of a medieval street, the way a boy chants "Matin, le Temps, Echo de Paris!"; the glow of lights behind the awnings as the gathering dark brings out the lettering, the captain in the Café de la Paix who looks like Otto Kahn; the patina on the arch and the Etoile, the salesman who says he has led Camel, les Chesterfield, et les Licky Streak; the bronze statues in the park behind the Louvre, the fake artist painting the wrong bridge down by the river; the great façade of Notre Dame, the shiny faced nuns hawking souvenirs beneath it; the fish market, and the discovery that they tie a lobster's claws here, instead of pegging them, as we do, and an ancient peasant, bending beneath a rack that fits him with the terrible precision of a polished yoke on the neck of oxen; the meal I had in the Avenue Victor Hugo, the meal I had in the Rue de la Pepiniere, the meal I had in the Rue Royale, the meal I had—wherever it was. In other words, a perpetual invitation to explore, to linger, to enjoy.
He was among those who responded to the riots, and learned from LAPD officers that the department often created special pins to commemorate major events. Several years after the riots, he noticed that friends retiring from the LAPD had commemorative "92" pins. He saw some officers wearing them at a reception following the 2010 funeral of Marine Lance Cpl. Rick J. Centanni, a casualty of the war in Afghanistan and the son of a Santa Ana police sergeant. He asked Chief Walters about the ribbons, as well as LAPD brass who were there.

What the optimists are missing is that the House remains the linchpin of all their future ambitions. A Republican presidency will mean little with Speaker Nancy Pelosi redux. Mr. Obama may well win re-election. What leverage will a Republican-run Senate have in the face of that, and a Democratic House? Or consider the possibility that Republicans botch both the Oval Office and the Senate.
This allowed for a range of only 390 miles on a single, 15.8-gallon tank. Drivers really need highway travel to boost the mileage.
School district officials often accuse public charter schools of cherry-picking high-performing students, leaving conventional school districts to educate the most difficult students.

Because I know they are going through some tough times."
