The whole environment is just cruddy for the Democrats. On top of the national problems, there was that big state income tax increase back in January, which has stuck in everybody's craw.

The Republicans refused to lend a hand this time around, and the Democrats are getting all the blame.

I'm not necessarily making the case for heavy doses of pain medication for childbirth. I will just say that for all four of mine I was what I called "an epidural waiting to happen." While many women will not plan to do so ahead of time, most in the U.S. will end up getting some medication for pain relief when they have their babies. So what?

Still, even my friends who have chosen to go through childbirth with no pain medication don't recount the screaming or the expletives that are inevitably the stuff of Hollywood childbirth portrayals.

Two suspects were fatally shot, one of them in a car while he was fleeing, and six suspects have been detained, police said. One suspect suffered a minor gunshot wound. Police have not released the names of the suspects, who were booked by 2 a.m. Thursday.
Lee's attention to the unspoken carries over into the domestic scenes, of the men with their respective wives. As with the men, there are things the wives don't dare say out loud, as well, but we can read their thoughts and see the toll the years take. Anne Hathaway, the star of the innocuous "Princess Diaries" movies, plays Jack's wife, in a committed portrait of a woman getting blonder and blonder, and more bitter and pinched, over the course of some 15 years. It's a brilliant and insightful performance, a time-lapse photography demonstration of what happens to someone who expected to be loved, but wasn't.
NCAA prospects: The selection committee didn't do the Cardinals any favors by sticking them with a No. 16 seed in one of the first four games played Tuesday and Wednesday. Lamar was the No. 3 seed heading into the Southland Conference Tournament, but emerged with the league's automatic berth in the NCAA's 68-team field after knocking of No. 4 McNeese State 70-49 in Saturday's championship final. Lamar counts on James for his offense and has gone 10-3 in the games when he has scored 20 or more points.
As of Wednesday, Slocum had seven announced opponents. That's encouraging. Things are getting much too cozy.
The numbers didn't immediately leap off his bat in spring training, but he stayed with the stance that worked last season, held fast to the approach and eventually squeezed the Grapefruit League for more of the same numbers he had in 2011. He hit .340, slugged .489, and he drove in 10 runs, the second-most on the team. That success carried right into April as he had three extra-base hits and a walk in his first nine plate appearances.
The river absorbed as much as 7 inches of rain that fell January 1 on the coastal range. If this week's storm drifts a little bit south of its projected axis, the county could receive the worst of it, Wilde said.
The title for "The Voice" came from the New Testament Gospel of John and from the Greek word logos. It's usually translated as "word" in verses such as John 1:1, which reads: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" in the New International Version, one of the most popular English translations.
No, it wasn't words but deeds that roused the beast. The poorly crafted, deeply partisan stimulus was like a sharp stick to the bear's belly. But it was "Obamacare" that ended the hibernation.

In releasing the list Friday, the foundation didn't identify individual contributors' employers, nationalities or any other details. It gave only cumulative ranges rather than precise donations, and didn't provide a fundraising total. But it did say that more than 90 percent of the gifts it received last year were in donations of $250 or less. The foundation has raised hundreds of millions of dollars over the years.

That trend troubles Sue Hunt LeMay, of Novato, who became an anti-alcohol marketing advocate after her 19-year-old son and his best friend died in an alcohol-fueled car crash. After his death in 2005, LeMay found a Budweiser T-shirt and hat hidden under her son's bed. "Our kids are dying in greater numbers because of this advertising," she said.
Some big changes occurred during Mr. Fleeman’s six years in office.

"To be mentioned with those guys and put in that category is almost indescribable," Brewer said. "It's been such hard work - the mornings, the afternoons, everything. It's about being in better shape and doing so much more than everyone else. It's hard to do but in the end it paid off."
The basics haven't changed much in all those years, but this is one of those places that surprises you with the quality of the food.

South Euclid has deployed only one mobile speed camera, which is placed on neighborhood streets where residents complain of speeders. The city began its program in May. Police Chief Kevin Nietert said a decrease in speeding violations over the first few months showed that drivers had begun slowing down.
The government only counts people as unemployed if they're looking for work. And 340,000 Americans stopped looking and dropped out of the labor force in April, which is why the unemployment rate fell slightly. The dropouts mean just 63.6 percent of working-age Americans were working or looking for work, the lowest since 1981.
Brendan Finn, Saltzman's chief of staff, said his boss had been cleared by both the city attorney's office and state ethics director.
Such an observation is telling, both because of what it means for Willis ("It was seeing Janis Joplin," she admits, "that made me resolve, once and for all, not to get my hair straightened") and because by sharing it, she opens herself, and us, to Joplin's vulnerability. "After the split with Big Brother," she writes, "Janis retrenched considerably, perhaps because she simply couldn't maintain that level of intensity, perhaps for other reasons that would have become clear if she had lived. My uncertainty on this point makes me hesitate to be too dogmatic about my conviction that leaving Big Brother was a mistake."
The bottom line is that whatever might have been the case in the past, it can't be the case now. It's do-or-die time. No excuses now, because no one will care. Scores are scores.
And, in this era of ever more polished menus, the fact that Snockey’s is celebrating a century in business is even more improbable given its old-school menu of fish house classics like deep-fried filet of flounder, fish cakes, deviled clams, and broiled bluefish.
"It's about time they recognize something that was known about 14 years ago and was first identified in 1982 when DuPont said it was a problem," Hill said. "For all this time, they didn't do anything about it."
“(Meyer) lost the team’s respect,” Thomas said. “That kind of stuff spreads through the players. They see what they can get away with, and they push it. Even the star players; they liked him because they were in the Circle of Trust. But it backfired on him. They didn’t respect him.”
THE FUTURE OF TOLLING
PORTLAND, Ore. -- The NBA lockout isn't really posing any challenges for Brian Grant's big fundraiser to fight Parkinson's disease, contrary to widespread reports and Internet buzz.
He told Mealer about Winter and invited him to see the dolphin if he got to Florida.
That's especially timely, given that Barack Obama's White House almost seems to want Santorum as its November opponent, given the Obama administration's war with the Roman Catholic Church. The White House either hasn't thought that conflict through or -- more characteristically -- arrogantly calculates it can win it.
Hammonton fire and police are continuing their investigation this afternoon.
Most come from cultures where teachers are highly respected, where education is a rare commodity not to be taken for granted.
"Reading that PR announcement made me want to bulk-buy Häagen-Dazs," wrote Will Heaven, a columnist for The Telegraph. "Why? Not because I'm a crazed homophobe, but because I'm so irritated by my food telling me what I should believe."
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — My favorite line about hockey fans and hockey playoffs comes from John Madden, the ex-Devil who always kept enough of the fan he used to be growing up in the Parma Court housing projects in Toronto to understand what he saw and what he heard every April.
The Consumer Electronics Show will kick off in Las Vegas on Wednesday night. The trade show gives tech companies an opportunity to present new products, and that often can send their shares higher.
Deanna Young grew up in an iconic central-hallway New England Colonial, but her mother had a taste for Danish modern furnishings, and those clean lines have informed Young's design aesthetic ever since.
Lawmakers will propose thousands of bills to meet those promises, but their success will depend on the legislative committees to which they are assigned and the Republican who oversees that committee.
These types of wounds, if formed at an early age, are literally hardwired into our brains. If they are from a trauma later in life, often Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) sets in. The flashbacks, pain and memories that are literally felt -- “psychic pain” one theology book I read years ago called them -- and cannot be let go of. Thus, the individual suffers at a profound level.
For Beckman's players, the victory was an opportunity to validate their hard work this season.
Sure, it bothers me now and then, says Cameron, frowning as he gathers his thoughts. I've been called gay. Some of my relatives tried to talk me out of it.

The situation has other implications.
Police leaders said local organizations have discussed offering an undisclosed amount of money to help provide a higher reward for information that could help detectives solve the case.
The jabs at capitalism hit the mark. Divka takes possession of the house and, without skipping a beat, helps himself to the dinner that's simmering on the stove. Glimpses of rising nationalism register in a lower, more ominous key: A military officer dons the Serbian insignia, villagers murmur about Croatia's secession. Hope and dread arise simultaneously, if not with equal urgency; for many of the characters, the upheaval that awaits them is beyond imagining.

I couldn't tell if this was a question or a statement. Standing there in jeans and a striped T-shirt as patrons in suits and gowns dined on the meal of a lifetime, I panicked. I wanted to explain that I hadn't been prepared to meet him, the only American-born chef awarded multiple three-star Michelin ratings simultaneously.
"All designed to create an environment where we can begin to win the battle against unemployment and poverty," Kasich said. "It's all designed to create a platform for economic growth, job creation."

Brooke: I think it’s helped instead of being three-sport athletes having the winter off to train for lacrosse. I think it’s hard on your body to do that every season especially at the level of varsity. It really helps to take the winter off.
They do it because it's fun and they can incorporate it into their daily lives, so working out doesn't feel like work. Even in the winter, they ride their bikes at home on trainers -- equipment that turns the bikes into stationary bikes.
In fact, the reverse has been true, especially during the frequent meetings between ExxonMobil then-Chief Executive Officer Lee Raymond and his friend former Vice President Dick Cheney. Pile on the millions the corporation has coughed up in lobbying, millions more in contributions to the GOP, and as, Coll notes, for the last two decades "Exxon was America's energy policy."
Temporary hiring by the Census Bureau added another 411,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 9.7 percent from 9.9 percent.
Monte Cook has fond memories of Trevor. "I know growing up he did something every year. He made a hockey rink in our back yard. He made a ski jump. He made a golf course. It was really fun growing up with him," Monte said. But he said they grew apart as adults. Until recently, "my brother Trevor hadn't came over to my house in 14 years," he said.
The official campaigning period has been limited to a brief three weeks, and the election process has been marred with legal pitfalls, violence and even threats of postponing of the vote due to begin May 23.

Officials have had much to celebrate since the base opened in April 2010. More than 3,400 seaplanes have visited, more than what had been predicted. Located at Wooton Park, the base has become a regular haunt for Florida pilots and a rest stop for planes trekking from as far as Mexico, Italy and France, officials said.
In a spring–themed lunch, a big overflowing serving bowls — perhaps two of them, depending on the crowd — is naturally the centerpiece of a long dining table. We chose a wide wooden salad bowl and a pedestal salad bowl for a casual variety of classic shapes. Smaller dishes make up the salad bar, filled with sides and toppings. Have plenty of these on hand in an eclectic blend of shapes and colors. Complementary colors and materials turn the table into a garden of visual delights.
Coincidentally, Blake will be the second player from Toronto on Denver's offensive line. Orlando Franklin, a full-time Broncos starter in 2011 as a rookie, was born in Jamaica but grew up in Toronto.

“There’s a wonderful connection between service and caring,” she said of emergency services. “You do not make any analysis of who deserves to be served or who should be saved...You simply respond when called.
There is an unsavory side to any of these festive observances, being that the drink part of eat, drink and be merry sometimes gets out of hand. This is a problem on many levels, but especially when a reveler who has had too much gets behind the wheel of a car. As has become something of a law enforcement custom on St. Patrick Day, New Year's Eve, Labor Day and Memorial Day, police are promising to be out in force Saturday — and Friday — to tackle the problem of lifting too many pints before turning a key. If you find yourself in the situation having celebrated a bit too much, do yourself, and everyone around you, a favor and don't drive.

And then there was Playboy, which was born here and endured here for many years, perhaps because, with its bunny outfits and pipe-smoking "Mad Men"-era founder Hugh Hefner, it softened sex just a bit for this city. Hefner put together the first edition of Playboy magazine on a table in his Hyde Park apartment in 1953.
Now that the National Park Service has opened a new visitor center above Lands End ("Lands End Lookout gets own rugged look," April 29), isn't it time it cleaned up the mess at Sutro Baths?

Williams. I’m still trying to find the key block on Jacobs’ 73-yard run. I can’t really say it was pulverizing blocking by the Giants across the board, though Diehl did have a nice combo block and Boothe helped get a good push. I think it was more a matter of the play being poorly defended by the Vikings. Three guys should have probably slowed Jacobs down at or near the line of scrimmage. Williams was one of them but he took a horrendous angle – the second time in the game he had done so by that point.
Richard Grenell announced he had decided to leave Romney's campaign shortly after he was hired in late April. Grenell, who is openly gay, previously worked for neoconservative former United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, as well as other foreign policy hawks.

The salmon and the ham broth, explains Lightner, share the healthy elements called omega-3 fatty acids, giving the two ingredients an interspecies affinity that connects on the plate. It's the kind of fundamental thinking about food he developed in a year and a half at the great Spanish restaurant Mugaritz (Tree on the Frontier, in the Basque language Euskera). He recalls that the legendary chef there, Andoni Luis Aduriz, worked on the development of a liver dish by spending time at the country's liver transplant center.
I thought Kate Winslet singing the national anthem while perched on a cruise ship bow in Lake Erie was a nice touch.
The Barber of Seville is also the last opera to be performed by the Lyric Opera under general director Evan Luskin, who is retiring at the end of June.

Except that when you peer past the usual suspects -- strawberry, raspberry, grape, apricot -- you find some seriously wonderful hidden jam gems that belong as much at the dinner table as they do slathered between slices of bread.
Bahrain still has an opportunity to become a success story for reformers. Hopefully, the government and royal family will work with the demonstrators to deliver on that great potential.
But it's not St.-Pierre's prowess as a mixed martial artist -- in fact, he's among the world's best -- that appeals to me. No, I like him as the force behind "Rushfit," one of the most thorough and practical video exercise series I've seen in some time.
They went to dinner and she read the menu.
Those are the teams that don't trade too much to move up and select a particular player who may not actually carry the grade worthy of the pick, but that the team simply wanted on the roster.
