Romney is running at Perry from the reassuring center. Both are harshly critical of Obama's economic policies. But unlike Perry, Romney refuses to hurl the accusation of "socialism." Romney argues that an overbroad condemnation of Social Security would leave Republicans "obliterated as a party."

But Romney's timidness on some issues is his main tactic against Perry. With the economy suffering a series of complex maladies, who wants a surgeon who only performs amputations?

Even as Corzine’s transition office was functioning full-time, the ex-governor had largely removed himself from the process, opting to immerse himself in his new position as CEO at Manhattan-based finance firm MF Global. As soon as Corzine entered into serious negotiations for his new job during the winter, he discontinued his State Police security and driving detail, Zeitz said. Former governors are typically accompanied by troopers for six months after they leave office.

The anger directed at James was reduced from the hate-a-thon of last year, however, both because of an actual victory in the previous meeting of the Cavs and Heat here in 2011 and because of Dallas' upset victory in the NBA Finals.

Golway conceded that question is very different from the one being debated in Washington, which focuses on whether employees have a right to a health insurance plan that covers contraception regardless of the employer’s moral or religious objections.

Still, there's a fatal flaw. The lack of direct flights, especially from the West Coast, makes the city a less-than-desirable destination for some convention planners. Fixing that falls on the Airport Authority and the city but also the local business community, which can help persuade airlines to invest in direct flights to and from the city by committing to regular use of the service. The benefits would go well beyond another big game.

It would increase the debt limit in two stages. The first would be a stopgap that would last through early next year. The plan would require $1.2 trillion in spending cuts in the first phase and up to $1.8 trillion in the second step.

A relatively small elderly population sustained these fictions. Now, this is no longer possible. Contrary to the Obama administration's posture, Social Security does affect our larger budget problem. Annual benefits already exceed payroll taxes. The gap will grow. The trust fund holds Treasury bonds; when these are redeemed, the needed cash can be raised only by borrowing, taxing or cutting other programs. The connection between Social Security and the rest of the budget is brutally direct. The arcane accounting of the trust fund obscures what's happening. As important, how we treat Social Security will affect how we treat Medicare and, to a lesser extent, Medicaid.

The son disappoints — he can't play cricket and he's slow-witted. He remembers his mother, Vi, and tries to reconstruct his parents' happy marriage. He remembers the sounds of bombs at night in 1944, when he was 11, and his mother's death soon after the war. Frayn blinks at each new detail of his father's life and even his own — the way we feel looking back at our own lives with wonder. So that's why we did that! So that's how we really felt! His father's frugality, his life as an asbestos salesman, his patience and his grief all merge. And with these memories, a little guilt — why can't we feel more, express more when the people we love are still living?

There is a challenge to believing in this kind of God. We just look around us and we see a very imperfect world. We see that we are surrounded by tragedy, by pain and suffering and by evil. Many people pray for an end to suffering for themselves or for others and find the prayers are not answered. Why? Is God unable or unwilling to act in this world at this time? Perhaps God is saving all of these actions for some Messianic time, or maybe we will only see the justice and benevolence of God after we die, in the life after death. If this is your belief, choose Option 2: I believe that God will establish a just world at a later time.

The reason for that is simple: A good team engaging Marquette in a halfcourt game shouldn’t have huge trouble scoring. The Golden Eagles are surprisingly vulnerable to the drive.

Many of the 24 essays here are elegies to a freewheeling, innocent time, or portraits of grief, obituaries of friends withered by the disease.

A number of these hypotheses and others were examined in a conference on the subject of current account sustainability held at UW-Madison last April.

Here is a seriously elegant locker room. Almost spalike, it has vaulted ceilings, new lockers, colorful tiles and a light-filled atrium for the showers. There are two lovely pools, both recently painted. One has eight 25-meter lanes. The second has five lanes, but they're short — beware of waterboarding during flip turns! Like Burgess, it's a little pricey, but worth it. While parking is limited, street parking is available along the curb.

DONG HOI, Vietnam — The National Geographic special screamed "World's Biggest Cave" found in Vietnam. Both my husband and I sat up.

The vibe: This French bohemian bistro has a delightful knickknack wall and friendly staff. This spot has the urbane feel of fine restaurants in major cities. If you go a few streets over on either side, you will feel the hustle and bustle of downtown Sacramento, but on this street, it's almost as if time has stood still and everything moves at a slower pace. Pets are welcome on the patio, and a water bowl and dog treats are kept on hand.

Lawmakers are likely thinking, why not defer it a few years more? It's no secret that the gas tax doesn't poll well, and Mr. O'Malley's initial goal of applying the 6 percent sales tax to gas purchases hasn't exactly won over the public. It's just too easy to demagogue on the subject. Just ask Newt Gingrich, who was in Annapolis just long enough to mock the idea (although it didn't seem to do him much good in Tuesday's primary).
"I'm in the quarterback fraternity. I've hated that about all the teams I visited, whether it was Matt Hasselbeck (in Tennessee) or Alex Smith (in San Francisco). I just didn't know how to do this.

Right at the start, Skippy, a 14-year-old second-year student at Dublin's Seabrook College, collapses in a doughnut shop and dies from an overdose of tranquilizers. What follows traces what led up to the death. There are all kinds of strands to the story but in the broadest sense what Murray has written about is the lethal consequences a world of corrupt adult authority can hold for its adolescent charges, themselves a wonderfully drawn mix of innocence and incipient corruption. In a narrower sense, it is also a tale that involves pedophile abuse by two teachers — a priest and a layman.
The Magic brass will not let this become another Shaquille O'Neal situation. Howard has made it clear he wants out. Where doesn't matter. Send him to Los Angeles, Chicago, New Jersey or anywhere else Howard has hinted he wants to play.

The silly plot is negligible — at the show I saw, George (Kurtz, the playwright) becomes a male prostitute, with his grotesque landlady as one of his clients. Adding to the low-rent vibe is a ramshackle set featuring a large air mattress, its inflation and deflation bookending the proceedings, with cardboard cutouts (“Laptop,” “Noose,” “Crack Pipe”) functioning as props.

Restore your sleep. Daytime stress can steal hours of deep sleep from you at night. It's a nasty feedback loop, because bad sleep makes tomorrow more stressful. Use sleep-friendly strategies. After lunch, sip herb tea, not caffeine. Tonight, relax with a good book and some deep breathing before bed, not a couple of beers and hours of TV or Web surfing -- alcohol and glowy electronic lights disrupt sleep.

NASA's Aqua satellite captured an unusually vivid image on Monday of twin coastal eddies cycling clouds ashore and thickening the marine layer in Southern California and Baja California. The large comma at the bottom of the photo is an eddy that formed over the past 48 hours. It is roughly 200-230 miles in diameter, and it is linked to the smaller eddy visible at the top left of the photo, outside the Channel Islands. That eddy is about 50 miles in diameter. Alex Tardy, a forecaster at the National Weather Service in Rancho Bernardo, said the clouds offshore are about 4,000 feet thick, and will get thicker going into Tuesday. The onshore flow will push and deepen the clouds that drift to San Diego County's inland valleys. Expect drizzle west of the mountains. Some has already fallen in La Jolla and Del Mar. These clouds will keep Tuesday's daytime high temperatures 2-5 degrees below average in many areas. The marine layer isn't expected to greatly weaken along the coast until Thursday.

So is Fiona Apple: Perhaps as a way to calm down during her Wednesday night gig in the backyard of Stubb's BBQ, reclusive Los Angeles singer Apple closed her eyes between songs and said to the capacity crowd, "You're imaginary, you're not real." It was her first full live performance in advance of her new album, "The Idler Wheel...," and Apple seemed to be wishing us away so that she could concentrate. The more she wished, the more urgent her delivery became. She pushed her contralto to the edge, where her voice went gruff and crackled.

Their new Thistle is scheduled to open Tuesday in McMinnville.
I'm not in favor of more marches and rallies that make us feel good but haven't changed the dynamics on the ground. I believe in the power of prayer -- don't get me wrong. But prayer without action is fruitless. We've played that charade too long. It's really about what we do when the cameras aren't around.
Matthew 25 "is about making sure you multiply the good you do," Ms. Hancock said. "That is why the guy who didn't use his given talent to multiply his talents was shunned."

Did government mandate this subprime surge to aid less-than-wealthy borrowers? No. And it would seem bizarre to think that the government forced Bear Stearns and other Wall Street investment banks to pocket billions in historically high profits by bundling millions of these "innovative products" into pools laxly given the highest credit ratings for sale to investors worldwide -- yet many conservative commentators would have you believe this.

Now, of course, prison recidivism has a measurable cost to the government.

Here's what I see and some advice: Keep plugging away, try to play as many Denver teams as possible to keep up the competition and, in football, work on line play. Frequently, the Springs' teams get beat up up front, just like those in the Denver Prep League.
The theory that marriage initiatives exist to turn out Republican voters in presidential elections is simply baseless. The marriage measures in the states of Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin all appeared on ballots that did not contain a presidential general election. Eleven state constitutional amendments banning gay marriage did succeed on the November ballot in 2004 -- the same year Massachusetts began granting marriage licenses to same sex-couples and politicians like Newsom started performing illegal marriages that were heavily covered by the media. Those events scared a lot of people who prefer the man-woman definition of marriage into taking political action.

Throw in post-game fireworks and how could it get any better? Well, a walk off home run by Derrek Lee was an added bonus. Whether an Orioles fan or not, it's nice to see the home team win when you're in attendance. If nothing else, it makes the walk back to the car a bit more pleasant.

Voter participation in primary elections is far from stellar. In 2008, the recent high-water mark, turnout was 40 percent. In 2004, however, turnout was 21 percent and in 2000 it was 20 percent; in at least six counties it was 16 percent or less.

Wayne State University law professor Peter Henning, a former federal prosecutor and coauthor of "The Prosecution and Defense of Public Corruption: The Law and Legal Strategies," said: "If the campaign official was directing funds to a friend or a colleague, or perhaps into his or her own pocket by running it through fictitious vendors or fictitious companies, then certainly you'd have the possibility of embezzlement or fraud."
Today, we have Republican presidential candidates attacking the free market, private enterprise and the capitalists who invest in America. One demands a halt to immigration. Others spent years on Capitol Hill or as K Street lobbyists while portraying fellow candidates as "career politicians." All of them claim to be the true heirs to Ronald Reagan's legacy, even as they violate Reagan's "11th Commandment": "Thou shalt not speak ill of a fellow Republican."

Van service, carpools or Metro bus passes for high school students are options. Reimbursing parents for transporting their children, or for forming carpools, also is a possibility being explored.

A: Yes, they do. Jackie, our older alpha male, I first met him in 1997, when he'd been in a cage at a hotel since the 1960s. At the time I couldn't even come close to him. I was told he should be euthanized, that he was just too dangerous, that he could never be socialized. I wasn't ready to believe that, and I took him out to the center.
I’ve been seeing a guy infrequently (mostly for the sex), even though he is one of the worst kissers I’ve ever experienced. It sort of feels like he’s chunneling for Paris, what with the roughness and all the tongue-drilling action. We’re not serious, so I don’t feel the need to correct his ways, and in doing so, possibly hurt his feelings. But should I give him a heads-up for all those other girls out there?
