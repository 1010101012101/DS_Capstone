I got to meet girls who didn't even know what I did and thought it was funny. "Oh, that's cute. That's what you do? Cool, anyway." To be honest with you, I kind of like it.

"Photography hadn't yet developed the broad, deep collecting public that exists for it now, and he wasn't even using the usual prepared chemicals. He was using direct sunlight.

That's when the show isn't a screwball comedy -- kudos to Yetta Gottesman for her turn as a daffy, high-strung dinner guest -- a political pamphlet or a coming-of-age parable.

Charlotte is a young French woman with freckles and an innocence that make her look like the girl next door. Alicja is from Poland, about the same age, but harder-looking. Both are college students in Paris — and both are paying tuition by selling their bodies.

"Montauk" seems more in keeping with Wainwright's previous material. It could have been taken straight from "Want One" or "Want Two." The song is an ode to his daughter Viva, and Wainwright dreams of the day when she will visit his house in Montauk. The song is touchingly personal, mentioning the quirks of Wainwright and his fiancée Jorn Weisbrodt.
“We completely rerouted the bus,” said Taylor. “Others were put out, others' needs and concerns were pushed aside. Adrian was well taken care of. The district did every thing they could.”
The theme of the day, structured around football lingo like "pre-game" and "charge the field," was spreading the word on healthy eating and physical exercise to vanquish the enemy: childhood obesity.

Take the plunge: Maybe you like snorkeling, but you don't scuba dive, and don't have the time to get certified. Or maybe you're just one of those people who doesn't like to get their face wet. On three of the major islands — Maui, O'ahu and Hawai'i — Atlantis Adventures allows visitors to take a really deep look at underwater life via submarine. It helps not to be claustrophobic, but the captain's comic patter and large portholes helps avoid any "Das Boot" drama as you descend 100-plus feet below the surface.
Jonathan Maus, publisher of bikeportland.org, has documented the public process and made his own suggestions about road improvements. Maus doesn't think race and gentrification belong in the safety discussion.
Merrill Lynch, another investment bank laid low by the crisis that was triggered by rising mortgage defaults and plunging home values in the U.S., agreed to be acquired by Bank of America for $29 a share, according to the Wall Street Journal.

A non-starter in his first two seasons who became an All-American this season, Robinson is a big reason Kansas is here. So is 7-foot junior center Jeff Withey, a onetime project who has become a solid shot blocker. So is senior guard Conner Teahan, a former walk-on.
"You know like he says the turnovers start with him?" Scott said. "The defense starts with him as well. He's the head of the snake and I know it's a lot of responsibility for a 19-year-old but it is what it is and he's got to do a better job and he's aware of it."

Using the size of the diners' heads as a basis for comparison and with computers to help them, the Wansinks compared the sizes of the plates in front of the apostles, the food servings on those plates and the bread on the table.

But Christmas Eve night, as we were getting everyone to finally go sleep, my wife was getting Big Bits to lie down on my brother-in-law's couch. Their basement was a touch chilly, and Big Bits was trying hard to get his now-much-too-small-for-him Yellow-Red to cover his body from head to toe. It just wasn't going to happen.
Employees at the Capitol came to work Monday to find that vandals had smeared swastikas on the windows. And protesters gathered for a second straight day to speak out against a law they say will lead to rampant racial profiling of anyone who looks Hispanic.

Why opt for plain or blueberry pancakes (although you can), when there is a carrot cake option? Or a bacon and cheddar version?

Today as a father of three, I look into the eyes of my own 3rd grader and receive the inspiration that I need to forge on as an educator against the relentless budgetary headwinds. Our kids are so important, the work that school staff do with kids is so vital. I can only hope that the future state funding projections are wrong or that the state can find a way to better fund school districts to appropriately support our staff that serve to protect and support our most vulnerable and precious commodity, our children.
Giroux has had a frustrating time so far in this series. He is minus-3 through three games, with only a goal to show for his immense amount of ice time. It was visible on his face after the game and even more obvious when he said, "I have to be a better player," through pursed lips.

Barcelona's effortlessness on the pitch is deceiving, of course. It's the result of discipline and hard work in training, just as the laid-back build-up to the final is a direct function of the team ethic: Guardiola trusts his players precisely because they're not the kind to party to excess or do anything else embarrassing.

Which brings us to another aspect of government that Obama apparently finds a frightful bore: budgets. In free societies, the executive is subject to the creative tensions of popular restraint, legislative restraint, judicial restraint and fiscal restraint. All these the president has artfully sidestepped. In the past three years, the United States has ceased to have any meaningful budgeting at the national level, with the consequence that Washington piles on roughly a trillion dollars of new debt every seven or eight months. This week, before the fawning toadies at the Associated Press luncheon, Obama attacked Congressman Paul Ryan's plan to prevent America plunging into the debt abyss and at least keep its fingernails clawing at the clumps on the cliff edge for a couple more decades. Don't believe him, sneered the president. "Hundreds of national parks" will close. Parts of the country will see "complete elimination of air traffic control." We will be unable to "combat violent crime." Two million mothers and young children will wind up without "access to healthy food". Anything else? You bet. The Ryan plan will doom everything everywhere – "the air we breathe, the water we drink, the food that we eat."

Americans pay the highest prices in the world for health care -- for doctors, drugs, medical equipment, everything.

The museum Harrison creates is a sterile and vaguely sinister place where species are trapped -- and seek, even in their decidedly unanimated states, to escape. It's a concept that is not only satisfyingly surreal but theatrically promising.

Again, the idea is to reinforce smart behavior, not create libertarian martyrs.
Unlike other divisions, 4A-II opened with doubles play, and Arcadia held a 2-1 lead heading into singles after victories from its top-seeded team of Sacks and Hoselton (8-1 over Cordova and Hogan) and its No. 2 team of Joel Rose-Kamprath and Caleb Rose-Kamprath (8-4 over Bo Olkers and Lubold).

We are told the Gaddafi regime has been illegitimate for four decades. But we were not told that in 2003 the U.S. dropped sanctions against Libya. We were not told that Gaddafi, in an effort to ingratiate himself with the West in general and with America in particular, accepted a market-based economic program led by the very harsh structural adjustment remedies of the IMF and the World Bank. This led to the wholesale privatization of his state enterprises, contributing to unemployment in Libya rising above 20%. CNN reported on December 19, 2003 that Libya acknowledged having a nuclear program, pledged to destroy weapons of mass destruction and pledged to allow international inspections.

But since the 1970s, all additional income from productivity increases has gone to the nation's wealthiest 10 percent, according to economists Robert Gordon and Ian Dew-Becker.

This being New Orleans, you might think that a representative of that city's other rich, venerable religious tradition, Roman Catholicism, would be called on.

("I know I'm forgetting something . . . ah geez. The hammer! I gotta start leaving that right next to my keys.") You rank your Avengers for super-powers and cool, and Thor has to be ahead of the Black Widow, right?

Schwarzenegger's veto messages, which explain why he rejects particular bills, showed he is willing at times to stand up to outside interests.

There are songs that I look up and see what's popular so more people will look at the video, and that's the most obvious way. I do a lot of songs that I really like, like Ryan Adams. I was feeling lonely on the road, missing my mom a lot, so I covered "Oh My Sweet Carolina," and that's about missing your family. I felt really connected to that song. [Covers] make me like the artist more. I've never been a huge Taylor Swift fan, not because she's not talented but it's just never been my thing. Listening and playing a lot of her songs, I've been thinking she's a very good songwriter. I'm thinking about doing a Dawes cover sometime because they're not as popular as they should be.

And Love? After everything that he’s already accomplished – from being a first-team All-American at UCLA and now a two-time All-Star Game pick – he’s probably transcended his Lake Oswego roots.

But even with its modern touches, "Sherlock" remains commendably loyal to the essentials of the brand. Holmes, for example, still hangs out at 221B Baker Street, where he plays the violin in a meditative effort to shut out life's static. In Sunday's opener, "A Scandal in Belgravia," he even briefly rocks a deerstalker hat, if only as a means to disguise himself from the paparazzi.
“Yes. First of all, I did lots of research. Also, I grew up reading his work. I loved his poems. I was fascinated by them. I even have a very old body of his writings. It was a gift from someone. He was a complicated person. This shoot was also complicated. We did it nights in Serbia.

"It's a strain in the elbow," said Tomlin. "They're saying seven to 10 days (without throwing). Getting the MRI results back and finding it was a moderate strain was encouraging.

By turns funny and sobering, sweeping and intimate, the consistently entertaining "Inside Deep Throat" plays like a giddy prance through the minefield of the last three decades of American sex and politics. It's a timeless story, really. Bawdy, can-do upstarts raise the vengeful ire of the cynically pious. Swap the X-rated 1972 comedy with a clever 18th century foundling and you'd have "Tom Jones." Minus the happy ending, of course.
