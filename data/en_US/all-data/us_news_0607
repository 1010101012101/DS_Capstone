Perhaps you get a little weary Monday, then the excitement of heading to a new place Tuesday picks you up. No one spoke of jet lag. The fact that we were traveling with the sun, east to west, helped.

A new production of "Swan Lake" – stripped-down, primal, "real" – is on the season's slate, and the company's artistic director, Thomas Leroy (French actor Vincent Cassel), is looking for a new Odette/Odile to fill the pointe shoes left by his retiring prima ballerina, Beth MacIntyre (a just-this-side-of-camp Winona Ryder).

St. Louis has come as far back as we have. The only reason we're here is not because of our talent level . . . it's because of our spirit.

"Intruders" comes from a very personal side. It is based on some very disturbing thoughts that I had when I was a kid, especially connected to my family environment. I put the focus on some things that when you're a kid you think are very important, like the way your parents are sometimes trying to protect you, not telling you special things or family secrets. Then those secrets become nightmares, because on some level you absorb things from your parents in a very unconscious way. Those secrets can create monsters in your imaginary world. "Intruders" is about that and the way fear is a legacy. Fear is constructed and developed from that parental protection.

Public broadcasting has served an important role in our nation's media landscape.

As a dancer showcase, "Lost Dance" delivers some epiphanies, bringing out the sparkling elegance of Makino Hayashi, equally ebullient in the closing "Lambarena," and providing Javier Ubell, Michael Linsmeier and Lucas Threefoot with terrific syncopated pyrotechnics to perform. Marred by some distractingly busy hand movements, "Lost Dance" with its Tharpian mix of ballroom, classical and modern dance, is clearly a keeper.
Gov. Robert Bentley praised Hammon's work and said, "The essence of the bill will not change: Anyone living and working in Alabama must be here legally." It would have to be approved by the legislature.
Hundreds of the 649 Argentine and 255 British soldiers who were killed, along with three elderly islanders whose house was hit by friendly British fire, were buried on the island in separate cemeteries. Because many Argentine soldiers lacked dogtags, nearly half of their graves are inscribed with the words: "known only to God."
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) spokesman Doug Hecox said the mandate is part of an ongoing effort to standardize traffic signs and set safety standards nationwide, which has been going on since 1920. Many cities neglect traffic signs, but signs that are perfectly visible during the day could be practically invisible at night, and that is a safety issue, he said.

GERD can be a serious condition because it can often lead to other health problems such as bleeding ulcers and Barrett's esophagus if left untreated. In certain people, GERD causes Barrett's esophagus if the leaked stomach contents damage the lining of the esophagus.

"What a game. I'll bet as a fan it was a fun game to watch," Eagles coach Chris McCabe said. "I think (the original feeling) was just a hangover. You could tell we were worried about the snowball effect a little bit."
"It's a propaganda tactic to pit teachers against parents," said Vicki Soderberg, president of Capistrano's teachers union. "The board is just looking to blame someone. That's an attack on all teachers."
“I went to go block Beasley’s shot and kind of landed on (his left knee),’’ Camby said as he was leaving the Rose Garden. “I got up and tried to run it off, limp it off. I went up (the court) a few times and it just didn’t feel right when I put weight on it, so I went out of the ball game.’’

The edge going into The Players Championship belongs to McIlroy, the U.S. Open champion, based on consistency. Not only did he win the Honda Classic in early March to reach No. 1 for the first time, he has finished out of the top five only once this year. That was at the Masters, where he was one shot behind going into the weekend, closed with 77-76 and tied for 40th.
The Moose had one final charge playing six-on-four after pulling their goalie when Mark Olver was forced into the penalty box during the closing minutes, but Bascashihua stood tall and the game would be sealed when Julian Talbot would score an empty net goal in 15 seconds to go.
He reveled in his underdog status, reminding supporters that his campaign lacked the money and slickness of Romney's effort and that he spoke from the heart rather than prepared notes. At times, though, he appeared to talk himself into unnecessary controversies, as when he said the economy wasn't the race's top issue and that unemployment didn't concern him as much as the federal government's threat against individual freedom.
One pleasant result of the poll: Only 14 percent of respondents said they got their pets from pet stores. Since many pet stores get their animals from puppy and kitten mills (not places you'd want to visit; trust me), I'm heartened to know they weren't seen as the best source for animals.
Mr. Currie has been accused of playing dumb (the "stupidity defense") and we have seen an impressive list of associates willing to step up and verify that he is, as former Prince George's County delegate Tim Maloney testified, "right at the bottom of the smart scale."

There is no mention of the July 1973 coup led by Mohammad Daud Khan, nor of his death when he was overthrown by Communist forces in 1978. Absent, too, are the 1979 Soviet invasion, the ensuing mujahedin war, the brutal civil conflict of the early 1990s and the Taliban takeover.

And that's a shame, because the movie reunites Segel with Nicholas Stoller; the two also co-wrote 2008's "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," one of the more well-balanced Apatow productions, with Stoller once again directing and Segel starring as the doughy everyman. (Stoller also wrote and directed "Get Him to the Greek," which was hilarious but also overstayed its welcome just a tad.)

Even as a developmental quarterback, Pryor, inaccurate because of inconsistent mechanics, is a bad idea.

Whenever I see the pink ribbon, I see the purity of white tainted with red blood. Is this yet another case where hard-core feminists will do anything to preserve legalized abortion? Do they really care about women or is it just a money making scheme which plays on the heartstrings of America?

"At a time when so many Americans struggle to put a healthy, nutritious meal on their family's dinner table, the unfounded mischaracterization of Lean Finely Textured Beef as 'pink slime' is unconscionable," Barry Carpenter, chief executive officer of the National Meat Association, said in a Monday statement.

Deschanel's own adorableness was much discussed, much to her adorable embarrassment.
Erica Nowak from New York, who predicted that Steven Tyler would be her ex-husband. She was rewarded with a hug from the Aerosmith frontman. But alas, a hug was not enough. Erica went in for the butt-grab as well. And you know what? Might as well hug the other male judge and touch his butt after the audition. Anything to get a golden ticket, right? Except she didn't get one.

Schaefer's enrichment class is the type of program Indianapolis Public Schools envisioned when it decided last year to follow a new year-round "balanced" calendar that provides two-week breaks in the fall and spring.
We then learned that she had never had a birthday party. Our daughters could not imagine that-who didn't have birthday parties? This wasn't because of religious reasons, but because she had been born on New Year's Day. "Who wants to have a party on New Year's Day?" she was always told. That was the script Ruby carried with her throughout her life, and I believe it kept her from appreciating God's greatest in her life.

Sometimes a group of us from the apartment - a mix of Brits, Americans and New Zealanders - would get together on a Friday night for a stroll in the warm evening breeze all the way along the seawall to Le Kiosk Restaurant on tiny Shelly Beach.

Repealing the law would eliminate some of the benefits that the exchanges could deliver, most notably the subsidies that make coverage affordable to the working poor and the ban on insurers cherry-picking customers based on their preexisting conditions. Yet state-sponsored exchanges could still push insurers to demand improvements in the way medical care is delivered and paid for — for example, by providing incentives for hospitals to cut readmission rates. At the very least, they would bring much-needed convenience and simplicity to the market for individual and small-group policies. After all, the problems in that market will still be here even if the Affordable Care Act goes away.

The situation was further complicated by the emergence of the Creole community, direct descendants of the 18th-century settlers, some of them European in ancestry but many others of mixed race.

The two deals left the Blazers with 17 players. To get below the 15-player maximum, Portland waived injured center Greg Oden and second-year big man Chris Johnson.

As value-added analysis is adopted — if not embraced — across the country, much of the debate has focused on its underlying mathematical formulas and their daunting complexity.
The action picked up in this week's episode after a pretty slow showing last week, when only one zombie was eradicated. In "Save the Last One," there were around 10 zombies popped before the first commercial break. Shane and Otis were getting after it at the high school, home of the Fighting Cougars, accounting for about 90 percent of the zombie murders. At one point those zombies were really piling up against that chain link fence. It was like teenagers clamoring to get into a Spin Doctors concert in 1992.

Adding to the confusion, United made other, unrelated policy changes at about the same time. Those included tightening several rules for its frequent fliers, who also tend to be its most vocal customers. Lower-tier, elite-level passengers could no longer get upgraded to United's premium economy class when they reserved their tickets; they had to wait until the day of their flight to secure their Economy Plus seat assignments. Their free-checked-baggage allowance was also cut from two bags to one, generating more complaints to United's call centers and straining the airline's resources.

Toler started 13 games in 2010 and experienced the normal growing pains for a young player. He missed all of last season after suffering a torn ACL in the preseason.

Now I'm seeing him as the leader of a franchise, and I really liked what he had to say."

"Not only would mandatory school lunches worsen the dietary quality of most kids' lunches at Nettelhorst, but it would also cost more out of pocket to most parents! There is no chance the parents would stand for that."

“But they gave it to us pretty good. We didn’t have much to come back with. Obviously, it hurts when you’re playing from behind early, like we have the past few days. And then, we just couldn’t seem to mount much offensively. And way too many mental errors.”
"The Stanley Cup is on the line. That's your motivation right there," Olsen said. "You can't afford to be goofing around just because you might not play the next day.

Americans are obviously very good at growing apples and creating ways to enjoy them, so why do we have juice from China? It bothers me to think I might need to pay a premium for home-grown apple products, and it's just as troubling to be supporting U.S. farmers' competitors.

The end of Modell's ownership, at least regarding the on-field performance of his franchise, was the reverse of that of Davis.

The Ravens beat Davis' Raiders in the AFC Championship Game.
Release of the photos in 2004 fostered international condemnation. It complicated international relations for the U.S. and provoked debate about whether harsh interrogation techniques approved by the Pentagon amounted to torture.

The Bobcats entered the game with history and the hot hand on their side. They beat the Tar Heels in the team's last meeting, 86-78, on Feb. 19, 2002, in Chapel Hill, N.C. And they relied on dead-eye accuracy in victories over No. 4 seed Michigan and No. 12 South Florida in the opening weekend of the tournament, when the Bobcats shot 45 percent from the field and 44 percent beyond the arc. In the first half Friday, they shot just 23 percent from the field. Even though Nick Kellogg made all three of his attempts beyond the arc, Ohio was just four of 15 from 3-point range.

France finally threw up its hands and in 1762 turned over the colony to Spain, a process that took years and kept the city squirming on tenterhooks. When the Spanish did take over, they proved in some ways more benign rulers than their predecessors  their policy on the emancipation of slaves bordered on the liberal. But essentially, New Orleans was impervious to governance.
While many other cartoonists angled for whimsy or the easy one-off, Conrad "specialized in hair shirts and jeremiads and harpoons to the heart," former Times Editor Shelby Coffey III once wrote.

That's the stretch where I see him. I don't really know where he gets on the highway, or off. He's never in view for long. Not long enough for me to get his license number in any of the score or more times he's flown by about 9 a.m. on weekday mornings.

On Thursday, the Vikings and the University of Minnesota announced they have reached preliminary agreement on the Vikings' use of TCF Bank Stadium during construction of a new Vikings stadium. Under the agreement, the Vikings will pay the university a fixed fee of $250,000 per game. The combined rent and expected concessions and sponsorship revenue that the Vikings would share with the university would amount to $300,000 per game, or $3 million per regular NFL season. The Board of Regents takes up the agreement Friday, and university President Eric Kaler could sign the letter of intent in the next few days.

Kelly recruited quarterback Ryan Katz, now at Oregon State, once upon a time. He lost that bid, too.

On board, one sits back with 30 others for a cruise that lasts about 30 minutes, during which your boat driver/tour guide demonstrates his or her extensive knowledge of the river. No factoid is too remote or trivial for the telling. I learned, among other things, that the Coahuiltecan Indians who used to live along it called the river Yanaguana, which roughly means "refreshing waters." I also learned that Michael Nesmith of the '60's rock group the Monkees attended San Antonio College, which is about two miles from the River Walk, and that his mother invented Liquid Paper.

The Blazers had just defeated the Phoenix Suns 106-99 Tuesday night and Mills had played a significant, if not starring, role.

So at the risk of sounding like I'm out of touch with the latest trends, I'll confess something: I recently purchased not one, but two, digital cameras. Neither was for me; I bought a digital SLR for my wife and a point-and-shoot for my young son. But I've been using the new cameras as much or more than their intended owners and -- to my surprise -- much more than my camera phone.

"She isn't consciously saying 'I want to dress like a tomboy,' but children imitate what they see and perhaps Shiloh wants to be like her older brothers," Jenner adds.

Traditional finger painting with diluted cow dung — a natural bug repellent, Petrus said — is thought to go back to the mid-19th century, when Ndebele housing transitioned from grass huts to mud-brick buildings. Wavy designs known as "tire tracks" are still sometimes applied to walls and also appear on floors. Although the more recent geometric designs are purely decorative, some Ndebele believe these older dung markings protect the house not only from bugs but also from evil spirits.

Here's the simple soup science: The more often you eat soup, the more likely you are to shrink your waist, lose weight and lower your total body fat -- your body mass index, or BMI. That's all according to new research confirming previous soup-slimming studies. And it means you'll also cut your risk of heart disease, diabetes and other unpleasantness that come with big bellies and excess weight. All because soup makes you feel fuller on fewer calories.

The panel is sputtering to a close after two months of talks in which they were never able to get close to bridging a fundamental divide over how much to raise taxes to address a budget deficit that forced the government to borrow 36 cents of every dollar it spent last year.
The accountability provision that includes an "independent citizens' oversight committee" is hogwash. School oversight committees are nothing more than "rubber stampers." They have no say of how or where the funds will be expended. The committees have no authority. The stated intent and purpose of Citizens Oversight Committees (COC) is to be an "oversight" committee. The term oversight could be misleading to public expectations since it may imply erroneously that oversight is exercised in advance of expenditures. The COC cannot ensure that money is spent effectively, or ensure that fraudulent practices or mismanagement of funds does not occur since it is not involved in planning or approving of school expenditures (source 2009 - 2010 San Mateo County Civil Grand Jury report School Bond Citizens Oversight Committees, Prop 39).
At least some of Padilla's treatment may well constitute torture under current standards, the appeals court said.

I had arrived two days before, when the official fair was already in full swing. Though it is commonplace to describe Miami as a nightlife capital, the day is the time to explore the hodgepodge of excellent galleries and cheap restaurants — there's the Rubell Family Collection, in Wynwood, a former Drug Enforcement Agency warehouse that used to be filled with property seized during the city's drug wars in the '80s and is now a temple of Andy Warhols, Richard Princes, and Keith Harings. Until the summer, it's showing an exhibit of mostly new work by young artists called American Exuberance.

Freshman Cierra Porter is a 6-foot-4 dynamite post that has plenty of polish. Her sister, Bri, is a 6-2 sophomore forward. Both are being chased by major college basketball programs, but both verbally committed to play for Mizzou. Unfortunately, both have been through season-ending ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) tears. Cierra tore hers as an eighth grader. Bri had her freshman season cut short by the devastating injury. Just last week, Bri suffered the same injury to the same leg and is out for the remainder of this season.

When the stakes of a conversation are high, many of us clam up or blow up. A recent survey by Al Switzler, Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny and Ron McMillan, co-authors of "Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High" (McGraw-Hill), found that the person most people struggle to hold difficult, life-changing conversations with is their boss. Spouses are second. In the survey, 525 respondents identified a single conversation that had life-altering consequences. More than half said the effects of this one conversation lasted forever. Nearly two-thirds permanently damaged a relationship. One in seven harmed a career.

ø"It'd be great, if not for the fact that a planet of Sith believers is always a disaster waiting to happen," the writer says.

SECOND TRY - Let's take the conservative approach from above and add in defense cuts: Draw down Iraq/Afghanistan troops to 45,000 by 2015, replace the F-35 with cheaper F-16s and F/A-18s, and shrink the U.S. Navy to 230 ships from 287, among other cuts. Result: still $1.69 trillion short, with debt flat at the ominous 67 percent of GDP.

James: Indeed, we are Coloradans and we don't get many D-I guys. I don't enjoy writing that sentence, but it's the way it is. Now, here comes the difficult part — the kids who have been lucky enough to commit early so far this school year aren't exactly going to Duke or Kansas. I'm not insulting anyone here; I'm all for kids going where they can. Take that for what it's worth.
This year, India and Pakistan approved a most-favored-nation agreement, lowering taxes that impede trade. Although India had offered this benefit to Pakistan in 1996, it wasn't reciprocated until recently. Official two-way trade of about $2.6 billion is heavily weighted in India's favor.

Tetzlaff found a good balance in the technically challenging first movement and the beautifully lyrical second. In the exceptionally virtuosic third movement, the tempo was on the overly zippy side, so that technique overshadowed everything else, and any sense of air or of irony was largely lost. Technically, however, it was stunning.
All of the millions of things that comprise a nurse’s job can be summarized in the term patient advocate. Immediately, nurses form the primary system of support for patients. From logistical issues -- such as smoothing a patient’s transition from registration and treatment in the Emergency Department through being admitted to the hospital unit -- to the medical aspect of triaging and assessing the patient's health condition, to providing emotional support to both the patient and any frightened family members, nurses must cover all bases of advocating for their patients with excellence and ease.

But Eric had a plan, which he shared with Bill. He knows that, since Sookie is only part fairy, the immunity to sunlight lasts only a few minutes. The ever-wary Russell wanted a demonstration, so after he and Eric drained Sookie to the point of death, Eric walked into the sunlight. Convinced, Russell followed him, only to have Eric capture him with silver handcuffs. Together, they will face the true death. Or will they?

But there is so much more, to Campbell's career and to Hartman's book. My enthusiasm for it may not be matched by those who aren't fascinated with how the Association rejected Webb's masterpiece "Macarthur Park" before actor Richard Harris had a most unlikely hit with it.
