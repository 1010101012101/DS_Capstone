Reaching many of the greens offers little solace because of steep contours. There are few flat putting surfaces. The course is a classic "out and in" design, with the opening holes on both nines playing downhill and with the wind and the incoming holes playing uphill and into the wind. The fairways are narrow and the Cleveland Metroparks woods lurk as stealers of errant shots.

Ryan Williams, RB, Cardinals: Tim Hightower is in Washington now and Beanie Wells has failed to seize the workhorse role envisioned when he was drafted in 2009. Enter Williams, a big-play threat with the potential to jumpstart the league's worst rushing attack. Look for the rookie from Virginia Tech to share carries with Wells early on, with the balance shifting Williams' way as the season wears on, especially if the veteran succumbs to yet another injury.

On the Saturday afternoon we dropped in, I counted at least seven children on the 18 lanes. And the rest of the place was mostly empty. We paid $4.95 per pair of shoes and $6.95 per person per game. (Yes, that's high, even for Los Angeles, even if you don't fill in the "gratuities" line on the shoe-rental-and-bowling bill.) But it was free to arrange a gutter guard to keep Grace's tosses in play—a crucial element, because this was her first trip to a bowling alley. And it was nice to settle onto on a comfortable couch instead of the usual bowling-alley molded seating unit. While a waitress brought tasty, unhealthy food (Exhibit A: golden brown nuggets of fried macaroni and cheese), we had a blast.

It means a lot to the franchise, which once enjoyed hearing its starting QB referred to as the "Sanchize." Yes, Sanchez has gotten the Jets to two AFC title games, but last year's flameout, his issues with wide receiver Santonio Holmes and a fractured locker room erased the glow. Sanchez received a three-year, $40.5 million contract extension two weeks ago, but, well, that's old news, too.

"It was just one night," Braun said. "There's no doubt this is one of the more challenging if not the most challenging place to hit home runs in the league. I think for fans, you want to see offense.

What hasn't been lost are the impressive dynamic qualities that the G37 - and before it the G35 - has had for years. It's why the G should be on your must-drive list if you're shopping for a luxury sedan that's engaging to drive. There's that connection to the road when you're in the driver's seat that's difficult for automakers to create, but which is instantly recognizable. A combination of minimal body roll, a rear-wheel-drive platform, and nicely weighted, responsive steering deserve much of the credit. Even with all-wheel drive, the G25x retains the feel of a rear-drive sedan.

I just stopped by a store in rural central Oregon and the storeowner had to get off the phone to run my credit card. This is substantial in a few ways: 1) broadband would allow simultaneous use of voice and data, 2) credit cards authorized over dial-up are prone to additional fees (on low-margin and small-ticket items, such as my snack, this could mean a loss) and 3) cellular service is inadequate to augment landline voice or provide "pseudo-broadband" through 3G services.

THE INDIANAPOLIS COLTS have been the case example of a good team that doesn't learn from New England. The Colts play the Patriots all the time without understanding that they're better than the Patriots and could prove it any year they steal or borrow the Patriot offense. If Brady is the league's great quarterback, Peyton Manning of the Colts is the league's great passer. But for years, Manning has beaten himself with the play-action game he loves so dearly. Extensive play-action means, among other things, that you respect running plays more than pass plays; and as a play-caller, Manning has that backwards.

McCarty’s atonement came in the 22nd minute. Dane Richards out-jostled Salinas for a high-bouncing ball along the right sideline then scampered past Baca and around the sliding tackle of Earthquakes captain Ramiro Corrales.

I'd rather spend my money on greens fees than gas and I don't need 7,000 yards of golf course to challenge me.

What can we do about it? Differences in genetic makeup, metabolism and even bacteria levels in the gut explain why some people gain weight and others don't. But obesity experts are quick to add that just because you've inherited a tendency to put on pounds doesn't mean you have to feed that tendency. Everyone can build lean-muscle mass through exercise, especially weight training, to boost metabolism. That will help you burn more calories even at rest. Exercise also may give brown fat a boost. Pregnant moms need to be especially mindful of excess weight gain, sugar consumption and controlling blood-sugar levels through diet and exercise so they don't pass on problems to future generations. Losing baby weight between pregnancies also would help. While Americans do their part, scientists will continue to look at ways to manipulate gut bacteria and hormone levels to help prevent weight gain — and weight regain.

In the other direction the fire was creeping toward Chinatown, at once the plague spot and the wonderland of San Francisco. When the flames reached this district, it ignited like kindling wood. It covered over seven or eight blocks, but ten thousand people were packed in it. It was said to be fairly honey-combed with human habitations underneath.

It was from Chinatown that most of the dead bodies were taken, and no doubt untold numbers are still lying under the debris. Probably, many of them were opium fiends, who were too stupified to make their escape from these underground death-traps.

Moreover, there is no need to "back up" wind output as he claims. How is this possible? The output of wind plants is aggregated with all of the other changes in electricity supply and demand on a massive interstate power grid. Even though many of those sources of supply and demand are changing unpredictably (think of factories coming on and offline, people turning air conditioners on and off, fossil-fired power plants breaking down unexpectedly), together their combined output is stable and manageable.

The reason for the peak of the heat this week? Credit what is called an "upper ridge." Think of it as high pressure in the upper part of the atmosphere. It will strengthen over us today, and that should result in drier conditions, keeping that cloud count down and also lowering the dew point slightly from the mugginess Wednesday. Dew point temperatures reflect the amount of moisture in the air, independent of the temperature. Those two elements are combined to come up with the relative humidity, or moisture in relation to the temperature. When the dew point gets above 60 degrees, people start noticing. Start moving into the mid 60s and they really notice. More than 70, and you're talking tropical The dew point in Indianapolis was 65 degrees or higher from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday. Workin' 9-5!

The matchup everyone has wanted to November 1. Two teams, about a dozens pros combined. Anthony Davis and Tyler Zeller. Harrison Barnes and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. Terrence Jones and John Henson. Every individual matchup as juicy as the overall one. But here's where the difference is: Kentucky's defense. It's been one of the best all season long, with its length and ability to guard the perimeter. That's where Carolina lives. And where it will see its hope of a sixth national title come to an end. After two tries, John Calipari finally gets to cut down the nets in the Big East. Kentucky, 73-68.

Gov.Martin O'Malley's effort to cut back on tax loopholes is a necessary step to reduce the state's income tax, and eliminating the mortgage interest income tax deduction is a good place to start ("Realtors to rally against proposed change affecting Md. mortgage interest deduction," Feb 28). While supporters of the deduction say it is an incentive to homeownership and crucial to maintain the housing market, the deduction has done very little to increase homeownership rates and is an unnecessary government subsidy of the housing market.
In Shanksville, Pa., where United Flight 93 crashed in a field with a force so great it shook the school three miles away, the memories of 9/11 have never faded, even though textbooks there don't mention the attacks because they are about a decade old.
