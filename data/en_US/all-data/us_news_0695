Why it doesn’t: Former Packer Matt Flynn, now the second-most attractive free-agent quarterback on the market, already knows Philbin’s offense. With Manning, there are plenty of questions — health and durability leading the way — but Flynn’s comfort level with the head coach could really mean something here.

He came out on Tuesday night and tried to tell people the Knicks weren't winning because of him, but because of the way they had come together. He didn't want to talk about his shot, his heroics, his incredible, indelible mark on the history of the game."

"The thing about Oscar is that we know about his life," Bolen says. "He's as well known for his dresses as for the way he conducts himself every day." Yet every day, at the office at least, it is the dresses that remain de la Renta's focus.

By licking it's parents lips the action causes the adult to regurgitate food it had gathered to feed its pups. Not a very romantic notion to think about when your dog is licking your mouth.

One day, the bitter, super-heated debate over SB 1070 will be recalled as an enormous waste of time, energy and human potential. How our nation regulates immigration is important. Far more significant, however, are the daily-life wants we all share (immigrants and non-immigrants alike): good jobs, quality schools and health care, public safety, a clean environment and the countless other matters that deserve our attention over whether hardworking and desperate people have trekked hundreds or thousands of miles to pick our crops, mow our lawns or clean our toilets. In truth, the greater threat to our American ideals is narrow-mindedness, not immigration.
There are lots of details to come, but I can tell you with certainty that our plan will be built around three priorities:
McCain's rhetoric has shifted so drastically in the past five years that advocates say they find him unrecognizable.

The only other time Ohio State coach Thad Matta reached the Final Four, in 2007, the most emotional game the Buckeyes played was not against Tennessee. It was in the previous round against Xavier.

Rob: Caron Butler's injury was a significant loss, the magnitude of which I don't think many people (myself included) fully realized at the time. Not only was Butler a reliable source of semi-efficient scoring, but he was actually one of Dallas' top perimeter defenders this season. Throw in the fact that the Mavs really had/have no way to replace his production, and you can begin to see the kind of impact his injury has had for Dallas.
And then she focuses on pretty drama like gossip and tabloids. Here's the upshot:
"You are going to find Portland a little different," he warned. The streetcars had all gone away -- then come back. Grant High School, where Wyman graduated, is still there --10 times larger. "And there are a lot of new Wymans you don't know.

The reference to cutting Medicare is based on provisions in Obama’s healthcare plan that reduce the expected growth in spending by $500 billion over 10 years, much of it by reducing payments to the private insurance program Medicare Advantage.

In a letter to Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer and additional city officials signed by presidents Matthew Markey of Local 1078 and Jason Cassesa of Local 1076, the unions wrote that the currently level of staffing at the department is “unacceptable” and that currently staffing levels make it “impossible to effectively perform fire-fighting operations.”
Some artists look to nature for inspiration. Nina Vivian Huryn finds that discarded man-made objects can replicate nature. Her piece "Hive" -- now part of the exhibition "The Hive, the Rose and the Baby" at the River Gallery in Rocky River -- approximates a giant beehive, 8 feet wide and 6 feet high, made out of, among other things, the rusted and crushed covers of 32 catalytic converters and heat-shields that fell off cars.

ø"Across the board, there weren't a lot of guys that were complaining about temperatures, but it's because we never really were in a big pack like we will be (Sunday).

I had developed this notion that there are five ways to write about liberty – or maybe anything: the letter to the editor, the column, the magazine piece, the scholarly journal paper and the book. Over the years I have attempted to make the case for freedom in each of these forums both in America and abroad.

The visuals are spectacular, and while 3D once again makes things look a little dark and dingy, both the Antarctic panoramas and the undersea bits with krill as far as the eye can see (or as much as the screen can allow) are stunning. Miller, the man behind the "Mad Max" movies all those years ago, is a smart filmmaker and knows how to use 3D to tell his story.

Tampa Bay's defense struggled mightily in 2011, as evidenced by its No. 24 ranking in pass defense and sitting 31st in run defense. It is also 30th in total yards surrendered and dead last in points allowed (29.2 ppg). It has given up 30-plus points seven times this season, and it could get even worse Sunday.

Santorum plans to spend most of the weeks before that primary in Pennsylvania - he has no other choice - freeing Romney to concede a home state advantage and focus on Delaware, New York and Rhode Island, states that also have April 24 votes.

With the centennial anniversary of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake just a shade more than two months off, the defining event of the city's history rests uneasily on a collective psychic fault line. Obsession and avoidance, immersion and aversion sit side by side, like tectonic plates oblivious of the other's presence and pressure. We think about the day the Earth shook the city into submission and we don't think about it, shun it and see it wherever we look.
Sad to say, students, whether in elementary school or college, no longer routinely discover the Marx Brothers and Laurel & Hardy as a kind of pop-culture rite of passage. Most wouldn't even be able to identify the once-universally familiar faces of Stan and Ollie.

When my grandparents emigrated from Poland to New York around 1905, they left behind nine brothers and sisters, as well as many other relatives. None of them survived the Holocaust. So I always suspected that I'd one day research what happened to them. Writing about the kinds of experiences they would have had in the Jewish ghettos was perfect for me because my passion is stimulated by exploring the lives of people who have been largely forgotten or whose voices have been systematically silenced. It was "The Last Kabbalist of Lisbon" that taught me that about myself. That novel is about a Jewish family that survives the Lisbon Massacre of 1506, a largely forgotten pogrom in which 2,000 Jews were murdered.

We followed the coast north, gradually leaving behind the urban sprawl that is rapidly filling in the empty spaces between Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, turning central Israel into one big metropolis. It felt good to be on the road, and I quenched my yearning for classic biblical vistas of rocky hills where shepherds kept watch over their flocks.
Traveling to Puerto Rico is like going anywhere within the United States. Visitors need to travel with a current driver’s license or other valid form of photo ID. Puerto Rico is one of only two destinations in the Caribbean (the other is the U.S. Virgin Islands) that do not require U.S. citizens to carry a passport.
Ziegler almost shouted his response. "But I know you're a person of, shall we say, limited means. How can you afford to ignore these outrageous Obama pump prices?"
Barrels and cones block one of two lanes on the off ramp, pinching traffic leaving the highway. The city closed the left lane after grates popped off of the in-the-pavement trench drains. Officials are in the process of determining whether the problem can be solved with a simple repair or if a complete reconstruction is required.
It seems that just about everyone in the food world is showing up at the door of this quirky, imaginative spot. One Sunday night I recognized Laurence Jossel from Nopa, Mitchell Rosenthal from Town Hall and Staffan Terje from Perbacco. It's the type of place that makes chefs stand up and take notice: the food, and the entire concept, are original.
Several real estate groups, including the California Mortgage Association, say the proposed measures could stall the foreclosure process, further damaging an already weak housing market, and make way for frivolous legal claims, said Mike Belote, a spokesman for the statewide mortgage organization.

For starters, Bork would battle against decades of Supreme Court precedent, which holds that the equal protection clause closely guards against gender discrimination. He was outraged by the Supreme Court's 1996 ruling telling the Virginia Military Institute it had to stop discriminating and admit women to its all-male program. Bork wrote in a diatribe against feminism: "VMI is only one example of a feminized court transforming the Constitution."

Councilmembers Armando Gomez and Althea Polanski, who drafted a version of such a law after hearings by their Campaign Finance Task Force Subcommittee, had to rescind it after an attack on its constitutionality. This costly effort at a referendum on the law was engineered by a Sacramento lawyer most likely recruited by an Omaha-based campaign consultant and lobbyist named Victor Ajlouny, who seems to have made Milpitas his very special target. One of his clients from out of town paid for the referendum signature-gathering effort.

Efforts to limit use of tanning beds by minors has been a topic of political debate, including in California, which became the first state to forbid the use of UV indoor tanning beds for anyone under 18.

The balanced budget constitutional amendment merely establishes a goal that future political leadership would have to reach. There are no penalties for failing to do so. In other words, between now and the day the amendment took effect, Congress and the executive branch would have to figure out what spending to cut and/or what revenues to raise in order to reduce the deficit to zero — and what sanctions to impose for failing to do so. The inability to agree on these policy changes, and sanctions, is the problem we already have today. There is nothing about the balanced budget amendment that helps us solve that problem.

In the past decade, moose have declined by half on the island, likely as a result of warmer summers and winters, researchers say. That, combined with more disease and perhaps unidentified problems related to inbreeding, again pushed wolf numbers down to 21 by 2007, then 16 in 2011. And now nine.

This is a classic tale of Irresistible Force meets Immovable Object. In this case, the force was the young, indomitable Theodore Roosevelt; the object was the storied vice of New York City and the rampant corruption of the police force. And what a story it is. New York always has loomed larger than life in the American consciousness, but few people today realize how astonishingly corrupt the place was in the late 1800s. More than 40,000 prostitutes plied their trade in an area no larger than two dozen square miles.

The global movement began in New York's Zuccotti Park, which Mayor Mike Bloomberg finally cleared out last week after nearly two months of a tent city even the police feared to enter.

Reached by phone, Passano said he didn't know about the credit on the Bellona-Gittings home, bought in 2007 for $750,000. He said his daughter and son-in-law live there and are part-owners. But because the deed is just in Passano's name, he shouldn't get the credit, according to the state.
The strategy behind the movie's June 22 opening is called counter-programming. Despite the big box-office numbers expected for movies like "The Dark Knight Rises," "Men in Black 3" and "The Amazing Spider-Man," there will be room for smaller movies to find an audience. Adults like to go to the movies in the summer, too.
"Although the data currently shows Ohio to be winnable for the president, there are many -- including some top Democrats -- who think it will be a tough job because the state is home to large numbers of blue-collar whites among whom Obama has always had problems," said Brown. "This week's voter repeal of the state law curbing collective bargaining, and the negative 36 to 51 percent job approval rating for Republican Gov. John Kasich, however, give the White House hope that the Buckeye State may not be out of reach."

øAnother reason kids will find this game fun to play is that it makes good use of the Kinect's ability to detect motion. Kids as young as age 7 need only stand in front of the TV to play. There is no need for a button-pushing controller. Players will lean, jump, move their arms and squat to control the penguins' actions on the screen. Most of the game has the penguins moving forward automatically, as if they were a riding on a rail. Kids control which side of a path the character will traverse, focusing on picking up collectibles such as snow cones, candy and beverages. Players will also need to punch with their arms and kick with their feet to knock things out of the way, strike a pose to sneak through tight areas and balance to cross over narrow bridges.

Unions call the changes a modest fix that would limit corporate stalling tactics, which they say can delay elections for months or years in the most egregious cases. Most union elections currently take place 45 days to 60 days after a union gathers enough signatures to file a petition to hold a formal election. Business groups claim the new rules could shorten that time to as few as 14 days.
