I'm not sure why the sand dabs ($23) were on the healthy side of the menu, because they were sauteed in brown butter for a rich flavor and caramelized exterior.

A: At the time the tree was cut down, your best bet would have been to make several deep cuts across the stump and paint it with Roundup. You can still try making a fresh cut and trying that method. You can also try making a fresh cut and covering the stump and surrounding area with plastic or a plastic bag to suffocate the roots.

On a busy Friday night, we were welcomed to our table at least twice, but feared getting lost in the shuffle with two large parties near us. After several minutes, however, our server was able to attend to us, and the rest of the meal went smoothly -- faster than lunch, even. One server recited a list of five specials -- a lot to take in. It might be more efficient to have a written specials menu.

Their back stories you know by now: One is the farm girl from Tennessee who found better competition against her brothers than in those archaic six-on-six games they played in Tennessee high schools. The other is from an Appalachian coal-mining town in western Pennsylvania, where girls basketball didn’t even make the radar, so she had to settle for being a cheerleader.

I love my mom and I love my brother, but I'd like to get through the last year of high school in peace. - Utah

Quinn's recent flirtation with realism -- a plan to raise the retirement age to 67 and cap pension cost-of-living adjustments -- is less significant than the continuing unrealistic expectation that some Illinois' pension investments will grow 8.5 percent annually. Although the state Constitution mandates balancing the budget, this is almost meaningless while the state sells bonds to pay for operating expenses, underfunds pensions and other liabilities, and makes vendors wait (they are owed $5.6 billion).

For those of us who value social and cultural diversity in schools, these misleading "grades" have had a devastating impact.

Apple's influence helped prompt the U.S. Justice Department in April to sue the device maker and a handful of book publishers for allegedly conspiring to fix prices for e-books.

So Pestano had the ball for the eighth with the Royals' offense overloaded on momentum.

Stents and related heart procedures generated an average of $81 million in annual charges for St. Joseph over that five-year period. Dr. Mark Midei, who ran the cardiac catheterization lab at St. Joseph until last year, lost his privileges to practice medicine there amid accusations that he had implanted unneeded stents.

The student who delivers it, Alice, is played to perfection by Sophie Nélisse, who had not acted before. What makes Alice's speech astonishing is that it slices through the cone of silence surrounding the death of the kids' much-loved teacher, who hanged herself in their classroom. What makes the film enthralling is the wisdom and grace with which it addresses the twin subjects of grief and healing, and the quiet beauty of Mohamed Fellag's performance in the title role.

One example he cites (and let's face it, it's the one many of us in the Portland area were thinking about Sunday) is Game 4 of last season's Portland-Dallas series in which the Mavs blew a 23-point lead.

Vitaly: Portland has a ways to go. We are not as international and I'm not sure we will ever be as international as Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Chicago. You eat in high-end and even not so high-end restaurants in any of those cities and you will hear all sorts of languages being spoken. Partly we are driven by locale, but mostly we are driven by local consumer demand, and the demand for international-level dining -- the very top end, the glamour -- is not here. Instead we have the grunge, cement-floor industrial thing.

Following his rookie season, when he was a backup, Pickett started the next four seasons for the Rams at defensive tackle and played well. He was a very active player for the position, averaging 96 tackles a season from 2002 through 2005. But in one of several personnel blunders by the Rams during those days, the team made next to no effort to re-sign Pickett when his original contract expired after the '05 season. They spent the next several years looking for replacements.

When she sings the part about fireworks in the final verse, actual fireworks go off. This makes Prudential Center smell like sulfur for a little while, which clashes with the ballerina onstage, but it's all worth it for Swift's performance. She acts her way through the power ballad, delivering terrific line readings, and accompanying each with an appropriate facial expression. Her best vocal performance of the night. She's really gutting her way through the show, and she wins points from me for refusing to wave the white flag.

øOne of the day's highlights was local pianist Jon Cleary, backed on Saturday with the three-member Absolute Monster Gentlemen. It was fitting that Cleary played under a colorful mural of Professor Longhair, the legendary New Orleans piano virtuoso who died in 1980.

For Mosley, the fight was strikingly similar to his bout a year ago against Floyd Mayweather Jr. -- except this time he didn't even land a big punch like he did early on against Mayweather.

Both wines come from Bordeaux's primary appellation of the same name in southwestern France. That means the grapes can come from anywhere in that region. Both are blends made from the three varietals of white grapes allowed for a Bordeaux classification: sauvignon blanc, sémillon and muscadelle. They contain different proportions of these varietals, but the differences in flavor and body are small. Both wines would go well with appetizers or a variety of lighter entrees, such as fish, chicken or dinner salads.

Today's topic: Richard Poplawski, the alleged gunman in the April 4 Pittsburgh shootings, reportedly obtained his weapons legally. Jiverly Wong, who killed 13 people in New York state on April 4, also bought his guns legally, having passed background checks. Does this suggest the gun control measures in place across the country are inadequate, or that they aren't being carried out properly?

This plot summary may sound silly, but I didn't mean to use it as a tool of ridicule. The problem with discussing the film is the problem with watching the film. It's all over the place -- two dysfunctional families, two betrayals, several transformations. Everything makes sense if you parse the plot, but the proceedings remain remote, notwithstanding Benoît Delhomme's vivid photography.

So, my take on this is that while Mac users must be careful where they surf, and Apple will have to step up its game against these attacks, an unprotected Macintosh is still, in daily use, far less likely to become infected than an unprotected Windows PC. How users handle this depends on their habits and their tolerance, both for risk, and for the downsides of constantly running security software, which can sap resources and be annoying. I advise all Windows users to run such software. But I see it as optional for Mac users, at least today. Time will tell if that changes.

In the summer of 1989, the Bolshoi Ballet Academy of Moscow had three performances at the Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater in Vail, and Donna Giordano was at each of them. Impressed, she called the sponsoring Vail Valley Foundation to see when they might return, not knowing that the foundation had begun negotiations to establish the academy's first satellite school. One thing led to another, and by December, Donna and her late husband, Gil, had become the underwriters of the new Bolshoi Ballet Academy at Vail, now the Vail International Dance Festival.

Employees soon learned the man at the top was no standoffish boss. He trained with the department's tactical team, including taking its physical tests.

Considering the grim condition my bracket is in, there's really no reason for me to be consistent, but that's what I'm going to do. I'll go with form in today's game, North Carolina over Ohio, Kansas over North Carolina State. Seems simple enough. Had it not been for the injury to UNC's Kendall Marshall, I'd have called an audible and gone with the Tar Heels. But with his status in doubt, I'll go with Thomas Robinson and Kansas. Sure they're young and they barely beat Purdue, but teams that reach the Final Four seem to have one close call along the way. And they can't possibly shoot as poorly as they did in the Purdue game. Rooted on by their fans, who should be the dominant presences in the building, I'm picking the Jayhawks. Carolina fans, you can thank me later.

2007 Alberto Tedeschi Spungola Bellaria Emilia Pignoletto ($20): Most skin-fermented efforts tend to be on the spendy side (think Josko Gravner) but Tedeschi's take on the indigenous Emilia grape Pignoletto, found outside Bologna, is a remarkably affordable expression - with the weight and texture of an orange wine but a slightly lighter touch that can take you all through a holiday affair. Grown inside a national park, this is packed with opulent flavors of blanched hazelnut, mineral and lemon confit. Consider it a counterpart to the much-loved Coenobium wines from Lazio.
