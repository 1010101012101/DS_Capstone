And his control drove Apple's business model. No screws to open up his devices. Those (patent protected) high margins from aesthetics allow Apple to break a lot of rules. Both the personal-computer industry and the Internet evolved as horizontal industries, layers of companies, each with a sliver of expertise (operating systems, processors, computers), that upended slow moving and formerly ridiculously profitable giants IBM and AT&T. Steve Jobs went horizontal just owning the online delivery layer to transform the music industry. He's trying to do it again to book publishing and TVs and games, and movies.
The 25 megawatts of renewable energy the companies offered to build is more a token than a real contribution to Maryland's overall power supply portfolio, and even 250 megawatts wouldn't make a tremendous difference in a state that has more than 13,000 megawatts of electric generation capacity. But the Maryland Energy Administration's proposal needs to be considered in context of the state law requiring power companies to get 20 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2022. What the O'Malley administration is seeking is simply a guarantee that a larger portion of that power come from facilities Exelon builds in Maryland, rather than from sources in other states. Given that another nuclear reactor at Calvert Cliffs appears unlikely and that new transmission lines to bring power from other states are uncertain, building more clean energy generation in Maryland — as opposed to getting it elsewhere — contributes to the adequacy of our electric supply.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Thursday that it wants to add debt collectors and credit bureaus to the list of industries that agency officials can supervise in person.

At first, Stowell found it necessary to reorient his feelings about dance. "It was challenging coming from San Francisco, where support for the arts is on a different level," he says. "Here, you have to please an entire community, rather than a segment who likes the classics, and to reflect the personality of that community. You need to remind them that ballet is egalitarian. There's nothing scary about it."

CHAPARRAL 47, DAKOTA RIDGE 36
Derrick Rose's speed, explosiveness and leaping ability are what separate him from all but the elite NBA players. None of his strengths was at his disposal when he returned Saturday in the 93-83 victory over the Mavericks at the United Center, so he passed instead of penetrating. The Bulls' leading man deferred to teammates and was effective in a complementary role.

Horsing around
Hannahan, who made a nifty diving stop near the line in the second inning, may not have homered in Goodyear, Ariz., but he pretty much hit everything else.

In the novel, he calls Ivar Street "Lysol Alley" and says the rooming house was "mainly inhabited by hustlers, their managers, trainers and advance agents."

We're now in that third phase, with the casino, the medical mart, the Flats East Bank project. We have entrepreneurs investing on East Fourth. We have a new form of county government that's committed to investing their tax windfall from the casino into the urban area. I think that we can thoughtfully make investments as a community that will keep this third phase going, without a decade stop in between. I don't think we can afford another decade, after we get these current investments open, without ongoing investment.
While that might be cause for a guaranteed night off, Matheny wasn't so sure. The manager said he would check with the righty during batting practice, gauge the liveliness of his arm, and likely hope for another reason to use him in the ninth inning. Matheny said there might be some relievers that he would hold back after a lengthy and stressful inning like Motte had on Monday night in the 3-2 loss to the Cubs, but it's unlikely that he would take that approach with the closer.

Clooney's not in the movie that much -- he was busy with other things, after all -- but his Morris is fascinating. The candidate comes off a bit like Clooney does: devil-may-care, comfortable in his own skin, willing to say what he thinks. But that's the public candidate. Behind the scenes he's much more aloof, even with his most-trusted advisers. He gives them what they need and then he's gone -- just like real life. These guys aren't best friends. They're people doing their jobs, and whatever it takes to get them done.

The type of thickener can also affect the flavor and harmony of the overall pie. When I first tried that sweet cherry pie, I used flour. Though it worked fine to thicken the filling, I found that the flour muted the more delicate flavor of the sweet cherries; cornstarch was a better choice, as it allowed the cherry flavor to shine and gave the filling a nice gloss.

In other health news this week, a blog called Small Bites took on the popular “Eat This, Not That!” book series, based on a popular monthly feature in Men’s Health magazine. The author/blogger/dietitian-to-be Andy Bellatti explains: “My main gripe with 'Eat This, Not That!' is that it operates within a paradigm where highly-processed fast food is the norm. Most of the books simply recommend one processed food over another. It even it fosters the illusion that one could feasibly eat at Subway, Applebee’s, and Chipotle in a regular manner and 'be healthy.'” Sobering thought: Bellatti notes that its iPhone app achieved half a million downloads in two weeks.

Moderate Republicans from suburban districts don't want transportation spending cut and have complained about the bill's treatment of transit programs.

-- Collinsworth said he didn’t know how Manning got the ball to Nicks for 12 yards on third-and-2 in the fourth quarter. I’ll tell you how. He knew where he was going with the ball so he took one long stride to his left to give him a better angle on the ball. Spikes was drifting toward the middle of the field and just missed it by a fingertip because of that slide Manning made, which also allowed him to get away from pressure and get a clean look at the throw. We’ve talked about Manning’s arm and awareness this season, but I’d argue his feet, aided by QBs coach Mike Sullivan’s drills, are the biggest reason for his improved play.

The latest interior project Tim and Susan completed is the wall-to-wall loft beds for both children. One of Tim's favorite inventions was orange ratchet straps he substituted for rails.

Here in Roland Park, we had minimal damage. Some large, old trees came down, but I’ve not heard that any hit a house. A few cars were damaged, and fallen trees on Sunday morning blocked portions of Roland Avenue, University Parkway and Falls Road. The city did an excellent job clearing those roads fast, and residents cleared most of the limbs blocking side streets.

Why do Clevelanders always compare their city to New York? People from Pittsburgh and Detroit don't do that. If its residents gave up their "little guy" envy and started strutting their stuff, Cleveland could become the country's next "cool city." It could become one of those scruffy, offbeat places that suddenly starts attracting creative, dynamic people who think outside the box. Can we summon up some attitude? I'm tired of people thinking of my hometown as a place that houses a museum.

Whether increased tax revenue could be a part of that final agreement is somewhat unclear. The White House and congressional Democrats seem to think so; House Speaker John Boehner seems to think the opposite. That very lack of clarity may be crucial to the deal's chances of passage. But it doesn't bode well for the prospect of a simplification of the tax code that lowers rates but, through the elimination of deductions and loopholes, actually raises more revenue, along the lines of the proposals by the Bowles/Simpson fiscal commission last year or the Gang of Six deal negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators.
3) De-clutter bathroom countertops: Buy a big lidded box for the countertop to store the unsightly bottles like contact lens solution and hand lotion. A series of small glass vessels on a tray can make a nice arrangement to display cotton swabs, cotton balls, and facial wipes. Buy them in graduated sizes for interest, and don't be afraid to try some modern shapes like square vessels in a traditional bathroom. Add an orchid to the tray (my favorite because they last so long) and your room will look like a photo stylist worked her magic.

Susan Walsh, APPresident Barack Obama and Budget Director Jack Lew will roll out their Fiscal 2012 spending plan on Monday.Day of reckoning: When President Barack Obama unveils his fiscal 2012 budget proposal Monday, voters will get their first hint of what his new-found rhetoric about fiscal restraint really means. Even the five-year freeze in domestic discretionary spending promised by Budget Director Jack Lew will require reductions somewhere if Obama wants to add the "investments" he mentioned in the State of the Union speech.

Hard-core conservatives, including many freshmen, want immediate big cuts, but veterans around Speaker John Boehner warn that could provoke a political backlash.

Nicasio doesn't walk anyone, so if his slider develops he will reach 180 innings and reach double figures in victories. Pomeranz could win NL rookie of the year honors, even with the club determined to cap him at 170 innings. Pomeranz knows the skepticism surrounding the rotation, and he relishes proving people wrong.

Of course, we reporters don’t know what we don’t know. We have no way of verifying that an agency properly held back information. That means we basically have to trust the agency to follow the law. The only other option is to ask a judge to review both the original and redacted documents and then determine whether the law was followed. But such judicial review can be time-consuming and expensive.

Yet there are those too who dismiss Christie simply because she was so prolific, because her books eschew the epic or deeply psychological in favor of a story best told quickly and with deceptive ease.
