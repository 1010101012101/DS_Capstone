We recently continued the hardwood floors in the kitchen (yea!), it looks so much better and now the floor isn’t so cold. Plus, that tile showed everything! Very frustrating from a cleaning perspective. Although I’m a pretty decisive person in general, I cannot decide on whether to do a rug in here or not. I love the look of the Persian rug in a kitchen like what Jenny has, but this area gets trashed and I’m afraid I would get sick of trying to keep the rug clean and free of debris. Maybe just a small one in front of the sink area?

"Given that we all have a limited amount of money, questions about what you spend your money on are also questions about what you don't spend your money on, or what you don't use your money to achieve. A lot of people, I think, forget that. They just say, "Oh well, I'm not harming anyone if I go and spend $1000 on a new suit." But, in fact, given the opportunities that we have to help and given the way the world is, I think that quite often you are actually failing to benefit someone, which you could be doing. I think we have moral obligations to help, just as we have moral obligations not to harm."
I saw an item in the paper that 5.2 billion liters of water were sold in France last year, 80 liters per person. That's a decline of 7.5 percent compared with 2007. Consumption of fizzy water like Badoit declined less -- only 1.8 percent. Is it the impact of the economic crisis, a change in taste, or both?

Maybe it’s because I come from a small family that I have this burning desire to fill my home with people. I like to entertain largely for selfish reasons; it’s a creative outlet, an opportunity to experiment with new recipes, a chance to bring people together, make connections, the best way to get to know your children’s friends, and I just have a knack for it. My philosophy is that every event, big or small, should be celebrated (or at the very least acknowledged).
I heard a choir of angels sing and a bright light appeared above one particular pair of shoes. I slowly walked over and there on the shelf was a pair of 1960’s Salvadore Farragamo reptile skin pumps. My breath caught in my chest, everything else in the room went blurry as I reached out to touch the holy grail of shoes. Then from out of no where a hand reached out and snatched them from the shelf. I fell to my knees and screamed “NOOOOOO!!!!!! I wasn’t done petting them.” Then just as the little boy in the final scenes of the movie Shane I screamed out “Come BACKKK!” sniffle, sniffle “PLEASE COME BACK!!!!!”

The story begins in 1760, with the arrival of the Collins family in America and their establishing a fishing empire in the town of Collinsport, Maine. The heir of the family is Barnabas Collins (Johnny Depp) who, after spurning the love of Angelique (Eva Green), a servant who also happens to be a powerful witch, loses both his parents and his fiancee Josette (Bella Heathcote) and then finds himself cursed and transformed into a vampire. Shortly thereafter he's locked into a coffin and burried, forced to spend two centuries in darkness. He's accidentally released in 1972 and returns to the family home, which he finds in disrepair, the family business having gone bust and the family itself in shambles. The great Collinwood Manor is now occupied by Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer), her teenage daughter Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz), brother Roger (Jonny Lee Miller), his son David (Gulliver McGrath), David's perpetually drunk psychiatrist Julia (Helena Bonham Carter) and governess Victoria (Bella Heathcote), and the mansion's caretaker Willie (Jackie Earle Haley). When he sees the desolate state of the Collins family, and learns that Angelique is the CEO of a rival fishing company, Barnabas decides to restore the family to its former glory.

I finished up my beer day -- not quite, but you'll see -- with a small glass of Allagash Saison Mihm, and it was delicate, sweet, spicy, and altogether soothing after the excitement of My Day With Pliny the Younger!!!! And you know the funny/sad thing, dear Diary? I was so excited about Pliny the Younger that I completely forgot that Kathryn had put on one of the very last kegs of the Sierra Nevada Exportation Sour Baltic Porter that I'd helped to make, a truly exceptional and one-off beer that was great, and delicious, and unique, and innovative (and aged in wine barrels for a year at Russian River...). How funny! How sad.
Well...Alex is officially six years old! He kicked off the celebration of his sixth birthday with an ARMY themed birthday party. The week before had been warm and beautiful...then the weekend hit and the weather took a nose-dive. It was chilly (50s) and misting, but we made the best of it. Alex had tons of fun as did his guests...I can honestly say that I didn't hear one kid whine, at least not about the weather!
I was very happy to hear all this. And he felt a sense of great fulfilment when he could feel that I understood. He asked me what I would do know that I knew. I said I would be happy!
Do you cry for the unsheltered women and children of the earth, who will be left for monsters to devour? Or because priests will speak only words, while their behavior is fraudulent; abandoning spirituality in an attempt to gain political power? Or because the so-called kings, bewildered by bickering, will allow civilization to decline into a mob of creatures who wildly eat, drink, live, bathe, and have sex with anything, anywhere?
That’s a very interesting question. It’s back to the credibility thing. I wanted to see if I could write a car chase in a realistic and believable way. We all like car chases, from Bullitt to the Bourne films and most of us drive, but I wanted to see if I could describe what it would really feel like to be in that. To be right on the knife edge of controlling that vehicle. I tried to write it as I would have driven it, if that makes sense. So yes, it was a conscious decision to write it that way, hopefully taking the reader along with the characters, but at the same time, that’s the way it came out. It’s then a question of whether it reads right to me, whether the gut reaction which I’m looking for in the reader is there in me as well. In that respect, it was a little like the unlicensed boxing scene in my second book, where I wanted to write a fight more or less in real time and as it would happen and feel. Then you’re into the re-writing stages, but trying to keep the natural flow of what is going on, which if you’re not careful you can lose when you’re on the second or third draft. If it works, it’s good, if it misses, it misses by a mile!

Acting on the complaint, the Court required respondent to comment thereon within ten (10) days from notice. In a letter, dated 26 September 2000, complainant asked that the complaint be now considered submitted for resolution in view of the failure of Atty.

In a resolution, dated 06 December 2000, the Court noted the letter of complainant, and it directed that the complaint be thereby referred to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.
And, in fact, the very title of Lenin's famous essay, "Left-wing Communism, an infantile disorder" shows that Lenin himself shared the judgement that he was a Right-wing sort of Marxist.

—The World in 2050: Four Forces Shaping Civilization's Northern Future by Laurence C. Smith (Dutton). Smith's book is a virtuoso example of what I would call political science fiction, extrapolating from existing trends in demography, natural-resource depletion, globalization, and climate change to see what will happen to the eight nations of the Arctic Rim—what Smith alternately calls the New North and the Northern Rim. "I loosely define this 'New North,'" Smith writes, "as all land and oceans lying 45º N latitude or higher currently held by the United States, Canada, Iceland, Greenland (Denmark), Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia."

But, we made it in decent time. They said that they had WONDERFUL days at school. The kids were SO nice and friendly. When we lived in Joliet Illinois (Chicago), our school was 70% hispanic. But those kids weren't really friendly to my kids. They only wanted to hang out with the other hispanic kids. But it wasn't the case here. Everyone seemed interested in making friends with them, and my kids were SO excited about it. Thats the way it should be :) My kids are DEFINITLY in the minority. I think our school here is about 95% hispanic. Eme was the only white kid in her class, and I think there was on other in Joe's. Hehehehe. It's good for them.

My mom used to work as an occupational therapist. When I ask her about it, she tells me, “Everyone can do something.” My dad used to be a Marxist; he is fond of quoting “From each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs.” Disabled people have a lot of needs. We also have a lot of abilities. So here’s my idea: disabled people living together as each other’s support staff. Get a group together, and see if everyone giving what they can means everyone gets what they need.
Also, do not go to an outlet store for your first pair of shoes or if you are changing brands like I did. Another hard lesson that I pass on to you: an outlet store is an outlet store. It is not a running store. I assumed the outlet store right next to New Balance corporate headquarters would be staffed by runners who knew about running shoes. Au Contraire, these stores are staffed by sales people who may know nothing about running or running shoes.

Two biggies – practise and play. When you’re not earning, you should be learning, as they say. Technique and experience are really important when things go wrong or something doesn’t work.

I was smarter than I let on, but I didn't want to be singled out - I simply didn't know how to handle the recognition. Hence, I didn't try too hard and didn't do anything to draw attention to myself. Even when swimming, which I excelled at, when I did win races I would be embarrassed. When we moved to NZ from Fiji, I was stunned (as was my teacher) to top my first year in Science class, with the highest mark in the internal end-of-year exams, and then had to endure walking up to receive a reward at the Prize-giving ceremony. I made sure that I never did that again!

Tunisia’s separate path has also been due to the much more moderate inclinations of its leaders.

Unencumbered by ultra-conservative political parties in the government – such as Salafi parties – the coalition has taken many moderate stances, including the announcement last month that Ennahdha would not endorse inclusion of sharia law in the new constitution.

And, last but not least is posture. Everything you’re doing caring for your baby at the moment involves you hunching forwards eg feeding baby, lifting baby, pushing your buggy etc. Good posture in seated and in standing is essential. If you didn’t do Pilates during pregnancy and you’re concerned that your posture is worsening now that you’re no longer pregnant, I’d strongly suggest that you find a Postnatal Pilates teacher locally who can a) assess your posture and b) set you a program of pelvic and shoulder stabilisation exercises that will help tone your abdominals and pelvic floor, and get you thinking seriously about how to conduct yourself in normal day-to-day activities like lifting, carrying and feeding baby. Having good posture when it comes to exercise is essential, hence the reason I’ve mentioned it here. In my classes for new mums, I’m constantly listing teaching points eg feet hip distance, knees soft, shoulders back and down, abdominals connected etc, to ensure that my clients are in the most optimum and supportive position when they’re exercising. Because I remind them so frequently, these tips then start to transfer into their daily lives too, which can only help improve their posture, mindset and well-being. So, have a think about how you’re sitting reading this now? Are your shoulders lifted? Is your back in a supportive position?

The other thing I've been thinking about is how all that makes me feel. Of course I believe its human nature to feel low when we are low and high when we are high... seems simple doesn't it? It's amazing how grim the future looked when I felt so poorly and yet how hopeful it seems when I feel better. I remind myself of a yo-yo going from one extreme to the other... I keep telling myself that I need to remember that so far things do get better and that sometimes it does take longer or even seems like it won't get better at all, but it will.

The story is absolutely brilliant, there were so many twists, turns and surprises that left my jaw hanging and left me in shock. The way Fleur Beale has weaved together the plot was incredible. What at first seemed to be a fairly neat, predictable plot soon grew into something much more complicated and action-packed than expected. It was really refreshing to read because the plot was not only layered, it made me *think*. The society Juno lives in reminds me of a communist society. Everybody does the same things, works the same sorts of jobs, has to get selected for ridiculous things like have a child and the “qualities” the chosen parents choose for their children all bare the same sort of resemblance. I loved how this topic was explored in addition to the regular dystopian government.

Hi Dear Blog!
There are many different kinds of people that share the beautiful planet you live upon, and each one has their own personality and character traits. You have learned for the most part how to identify someone who is boisterous, you can figure out someone who is withdrawn or possibly shy by simple observations. The personality types are varied and complex and each one requires fluid understanding and acceptance. Each type has something worthwhile to contribute. It is important to learn how to co-relate to all people without causing harm to their emotional and mental health. And you do this with the pure love that is inside your heart. You act with love in all you do. You not only show kindness, you are kind. Everything you do, you do with the pure purpose of loving unconditionally and accepting everyone as equal and important. It is the way of God and it is your way also; to act, to think to feel and to be as God. Living purely and simply within your heart throughout all parts of your life.

Most would assume that orphanages in China are set up to care for abandoned children found scattered around the countryside. What is usually overlooked is that with the introduction of international adoption in 1992, fees paid by foreign families has become a substantial source of revenue for China's social welfare program, revenue that is used to build lavish and impressive orphanages and Old Folk's Homes, used to "benefit" local and Provincial authorities, and used to pay the salaries of an entire bureaucratic structure dedicated to international adoptions. Everyone involved in China's international adoption program has an incentive to keep the program going. The payoff is obvious -- for every child adopted by a foreign family, the orphanage receives $5,000 (35,000 yuan) in "donations".

Quite honestly, it's a very easy way to test, in the privacy of your own home, to see if you have a low sperm count. Just collect a sample in the provided cup, mix it with the testing solution, and put a few drops in the tester. A few minutes later, you read the test. My result was a normal sperm count. While this was comforting, we still don't know what's preventing us from becoming pregnant.

Well I took it out of the box & put it in our 1/2 bath downstairs. He took immediate interest. I showed him that he sits on it and closes the top then we wash our hands. So now if I go in I tell him "Mommy has to go potty, do you want to sit on your potty?" *the things we do for our children - I have never been a pee in front of ANYONE kinda girl...* Well it is fun and new so he is enjoying it. He is starting to acknowledge more about when he makes us a "prize" he puts his hands behind his back and says "stinky" sometimes he means it sometimes he is trying to be funny. Then this morning out of nowhere he says "potty" he tends to repeat it when I say it but volunteered it. So I said let's go to the potty and then I was like then he sat with his pants on. Well I decided to actually try the real potty setting. When I pulled his diaper off it was hot like he had just wet them! I'm taking this as a step forward :)

I much prefer clothes that flow and move with me, but this ill-fitting suit is entirely my own fault. I have gained so much weight since being laid off that my suit just doesn't fit me all that well anymore. In fact, I feel like a stuffed sausage. Even my feet feel like they're stuffed in my shoes. Which is no way to walk into an interview.
But it probably won’t.
I have the foundation. I kept the faith. Now I only have to continue to forgive. I have to do this for me. So I don’t become a prisoner of my own hate. So I can truly be free from my past. And while I know I have a choice in the matter sometimes I don’t feel like I do. Because when I chose to have children I gave up the right to screw up my own life. I am the most important person to my children. They look to me for now as their filter for how they make sense of the world around them. I know they are growing up and that influence will diminish quickly as the years progress. But for now I have an obligation to show them how to do this right. And lets face it…I AM a survivor. So I will choose to forgive again today, tomorrow, and the next day.
Last summer I heard of children being sold into slavery. I can’t sit by. Several months ago while praying, I felt I was to pray for the children in Cambodia, I have been waiting and watching. I received an email about serving kids in Cambodia and chose to be involved. I believe this is what I am to do, so I am. I want to get more involved. This is a step! I hope to make connections with others and join in to help these children and women; as well as getting others involved upon my return.
Anyway, the way I feel is that, the Bersih movement has really changed how I feel about my home country. The democracy is dying, so to speak. Hence, we must defend it, to allow the voices of the people determine the true shape of the country. I love Malaysia. It’s where I was born, and it’s definitely where I’ll exhale my last breathe. I want it to look good, in the international arena, not just for now, but in the future too, and with that, I can proudly say that I am a Malaysian.
I've noticed, as I come to know more and more writers personally, and as other writers make more public appearances, that I now often hear the author's 'real' voice in my head as I read. I first noticed it reading The Woman Who Thought Too Much, a brilliant memoir by my friend the poet Joanne Limburg, perhaps because it was such a personal book. I read slowly, hearing every word as spoken by her. I was reading Margaret Atwood's Negotiating with the Dead the other day, and that was in her voice, too. It happens less with fiction, probably because most good fiction has its own voice, but it's still there to a degree.

The Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2005, Pinksy responded, “assumed tax-exempt financing, provided through the state.” (So did the General Project Plan approved in 2006.) “In terms of additional assistance, we all know that we’re operating in a difficult economic and financial environment. The Nets—Forest City Ratner has made clear to us that that’s having impacts on their project. They have not made specific requests for additional financial assistance.”

10:00am. While hurriedly taking public transportation to the main terminal to catch a bus to catch a train, the downtown traffic stopped, swallowed its own tail, and pondered its predicament. It just folded up itself, pouting like a toddler who didn’t want to eat its oatmeal. Metal boxed me in from all sides. Honks punctuated the standstill like a thousand modern gunslingers bent on justice. We simmered in exhaust fumes that seemed to have every advantage over the thin mountain air, that in all actuality, barely exists in the first place. Most passengers accepted this fate and settled in for the long haul, but one elderly woman insulted the driver—as if all the world’s problems sprouted from his very seed—, humiliating him in a voice more appropriate for a construction zone, then stepped off in a flurry of swear words and disappeared into the sidewalk masses. I was happy to hear other passengers console the driver. “Don’t pay her any mind, she’s crazy” and “Continue sir, we’re with you” were voiced from the twenty some rows inside the blue-painted school bus.
I took her to the doctor yesterday morning, to see the Awesome Nurse of Love, who took one look at her snotty face and listened to her phlegmy cough and felt her hot little head and gave me drugs. Oh, drugs. The only way they could have been more welcome was if they had been for me.

I do not think that I will be walking the same after today. There is something about pulling the groin muscle that just messing everything up. I nearly crawled into the kitchen to where the beloved family with hearing problems were. No comments like, “sorry, we didn’t hear you” or “are you OK”. All I got was laughter. It haunted my ears as I am sure it did my mothers years ago. Why did I even tell them. Everything you do as a teen comes back to haunt you as a parent. At least I was within the privacy of four walls and my pants were stretchy.
The flame of liberty’s torch is no longer just slowly being extinguished. Each day brings new Executive Orders, new laws, new regulations, each more ominous than the last. Corruption in our government and our financial markets is rampant. The disease of dependency is infecting every layer of society. America is dying. We need an army of citizens, motivated and committed, to restore liberty in America, to breathe new life, new vibrancy into a nation on life support. We will not return our nation’s vitality with lawyers. We will not be prescribed the cures for our ailments by opportunistic politicians pedaling the latest edition of What Will It Take to Buy Your Vote. We simply will not. America is on the brink of flatlining.

A humorous followup to some prosperity candle work I did with Sekhmet about a month ago: A couple of the people in my spell group reported some nice financial windfalls and I was wondering why my spellwork seems to be more effective for others rather than for myself. Anne and I have been struggling a bit financially and I was hit pretty hard with a major dental bill early in March. We won’t get paid for our art show sales until mid-May. So a few days ago at dinner I was complaining a bit about my spell results (which was not cool of me in light of the art sales). After dinner, when I went online to check my email messages, I was surprised to see a PayPal notification that a friend of mine had prepaid for a commission that I haven’t even started yet.

But 40. Forty is also a time to exploit your withering hormones and tell everyone exactly into which dark crevice(s) they can stick their, uh, demands. Forty is a time to do the things you were too afraid or too broke to do when you were younger. It's a time to re-live some of your glory days or live them the way you would have if you hadn't been busy with building that career and family. It's a time to reacquaint yourself with your partner now that the kids aren't sleeping between you. It's a time to eat at decent restaurants instead of cheap, family-friendly ones.
The politically correct in favor of ethnic privilege in turn were followed by the avaricious and pompously self-righteous UN, which proclaimed the lands of America, including Mount Rushmore, should be restored to native tribes, who are now to be heirs because of their ancestors' previous occupancy. Should the UN's wishes prevail, one can only imagine the ethnic Gold Rush as platinum blondes and pale redheads stampede to stake out claims to Native American ethnicity.

I had the pleasure of visiting his booth at the Austin Bridal Extravaganza show that my mother-in-law, future sister-in-law, and I attended last weekend. We've chatted a couple times previously because we're both in the Austin area cake club and we both work in the video game industry. I congratulated him on his work in Sony's DC Universe Online that just launched and, of course, on his work on TLC. So far in the series he's still in the competition and we're all rooting for him. Here are the display cakes that he had at the bridal show.

The energy that is being visited upon this earth has been expected. The Ancients predicted it and we have given you recent channellings, even the channeling given in that country which you would call Peru, about the shift of what we would call the movement of the feathered serpent [first presented in Kryon, Book 8 in 2000]. There’s an actual polarity shift happening between the male and female energy of the planet. The Northern Hemisphere, which has always been masculine-heavy, is changing. The Southern Hemisphere, which has not been biased in that way, is changing. The wisdom of the Ancients in the Southern Hemisphere is beginning to replace the wisdom of the Ancients in the North. And you’re starting to see a softer Human Being.

However, I think increasing worker power through the empowering of unions is probably the most crucial and indispensable step. The experience of the British Labour Party during the Blair and Brown years have shown that without counter-acting the “undertow” of neoliberal political economy, income transfers are extremely limited in their effectiveness. A combination of direct job creation in order to counter-effect this undertow and labor law reform to give unions space to run is needed to allow income transfers to live up to their potential.
We may use that verse regarding salvation when we speak of the many religions and gospels that man dreams up. They think they are right but find, in the end, eternal damnation. But we can also use this in the life of a believer. God has a plan for your life and if you reject that plan you cannot expect His blessing but rather an unfruitful life. Had Paul stayed in Jerusalem he not only would be out of the will of God but also experience an unfruitful ministry.

The truth of the matter is that many local congregations of both Christian (incl. Catholic) and Jewish designation have lost themselves somewhere between the issues of this life and those of the next. While many congregations have established some sort of help for those less fortunate, a soup kitchen or clothing closet, the majority of congregants either do not participate or do so legalistically – it’s the thing to do! For such a huge “organization,” it remains virtually ineffective in re-directing society. Have you noticed?
Remember all those times when your hand hovered over a perfectly smart shirt while shopping, and you hesitated just because it was pink? Or that look you got every time you told someone you didn’t know how to cook? “You’re a man, you can’t wear pink!” and “You’re a woman, how will you serve your family and be a good housewife if you can’t cook?!”. These might be the more exaggerated forms of gender stereotyping that exists all around us, today. But love it or hate it, you can’t deny it.

They were momentarily bemused by this but then decided that they needed to find the crystal and fast; some probing of the walls on the north side of the room revealed an area where a draft was coming from a gap in the stone. Elysia stood back and fired a brace of Magic Missiles at the stone, which slowly swung open to reveal a passage beyond. They started up it but they had only got half way when the creature reappeared behind them and attacked again. Elysia’s attacks caused it some damage but it seemed to be shrugging off some of the missile attacks this time and a Sunburst failed to have any impact whatsoever. She was struck by its huge bone hook and neatly grabbed, whereupon the scorpion tail reached up and over and stung her; she felt a strange weakness passing through her.

Residents of Hope didn’t simply give up and accept their fate. Instead, they circulated petitions and attended meetings and voiced their opinions and filed an appeal. To no avail.

The stories, and television reenactments, of Edgar Allan Poe’s works fascinated me as a young reader. At the time, I am sure there was much I did not understand. Recently, I reread his trilogy of murder mysteries, The Murders in the Rue Morgue (1841); The Mystery of Marie Roget (1842-1843); and The Purloined Letter (1844). There were phrases, on rereading, that I still had to break down to comprehend. (...in furtherance of the impression...)
Because the Ramos Gin Fizz requires eggs and there were none behind the bar and the kitchen was closed, Ugo offered to "climb into" the closed room service somehow to procure the needed ingredient. We waited for sometime, until he returned: egg in one hand, other hand held gingerly against his chest and a curious expression. Apparently, during the egg-hunt Ugo broke his hand (in two places we found out later) and had to close the bar for the night to newcomers.
Australia is a nation with a variety of education services to cater for a large influx of migrants.

This plane actually has USB charging station at your seat, the biggest seat TVs I have ever seen on an airplane and so on and so forth. It is not like I thought I was in first-class while it coach or anything. But when you are in an airplane for 8 hours, I think that little things can make a big difference. For example, I usually spend a fair bit of time waiting for an available restroom, well not this time. Are there more towelettes on the A380? I don't know. Maybe. I didn't take a tour of the "up-stairs", but I did hear that it was very nice. Another "fun" feature was that we got to see ourselves taking off and landing. There was plenty of room for my luggage and the kids could easily sleep with their seat belts fastened.
I've learned that what we do in this world really does matter - the lives we touch, the moments we share, the love we give to others. Because those are the things that the people we leave behind will always remember after we're gone.

At night the smoke of the first fire taints that air - pollution I know, but so closely linked to this time of year as to be essential. In the past, as a kid, it would have meant the slow smouldering of piles of leaves, raked together in the corner of the garden and committed to the fire. The ash was spread on the vegetable beds. Leaves to ashes and ashes back to leaves. But now such things are frowned upon. The first frost would have knocked back the weeds in Embrough Pond and my thoughts would have turned to roach - wonderful fish, never very big, but each looking as if it had been newly minted that day.

I did the same thing, dandelion and obligation words. I noticed an old brick sitting by the porch; it was small, old and basically the same size of the mouse. I picked it up and put it as a tombstone. I was sad at the death of creatures of this world, and for my love of mice and rats-domesticated-. I silently said these words “You foraged for life and food; you are honored by my heart and love. May you rest in peace.”

Thank you for sending them to me.
I liked the name Green Willow Pastures but no one else did. I like names that have to do with birds or trees - mostly trees. I like the name Ravenscroft or Ravenstoft but both of those are names of farms I know. Names of other farms I like are Daisyhill, Rainshadow, Green Croft Gardens, Tideview, Pineridge... I do not like the name 'Andrea's Farm'...heh
However, it seems that both genus names are invalid. 'Cimoliasaurus' has been described as a 'garbage taxon' and several nondescript fossils from Europe and Australia have also been ascribed to this genus, much in the same way as the early tendency to call all early canivorous dinosaur finds 'Megalosaurus'

All the narratives about war and disasters in Africa enable more “humanitarian” intervention. The intervention is “justified” by a disasterous situation. But the intervention is not designed to alleviate the situation, but rather, take advantage of it, allowing the “humanitarians” to acquire land and resources. Only the surface of the intervention is designed to appear humanitarian to the people outside the affected countries, who are generally not knowledgeable, and not particularly interested. For examples see the land acquisitions of Jarch in Sudan, or the US sponsored invasion of Somalia Dec 2006 and Jan 2007, or the military assistance provided to the Nigerian government to help put down the violence in the Niger Delta.
The ending was less than climatic which was a little disappointing but I’m not sure how I expected it to end. It seemed like, after all the destruction and murder the killer had done, his death should have been a bit more colorful and inventive.
While I was there, I picked up my painting. This is an early birthday present from my Mom (with a little help from me). They are so great there, they have lay-a-way. I think everyone should have something beautiful in their house.

An irony here is that it is precisely nationalism that German capitalists and their corporate media outlets wield to maintain the policies that have worked out so well for them. The German newspaper Bild — the equivalent of a Murdoch tabloid — is fond of screaming headlines such as “Now they want more!” in response to further loans to Greece. Never mind that the Greek government is merely a pass-through; the loans are going straight to the banks, bond traders and hedge funds that hold Greek debt, and it is Greek workers, not German workers, who will be paying the price. A terrible price it is: During 2011, Greek public- and private-sector salaries were cut by one-third and pensions reduced, while many employees and pensioners have ceased being paid at all. This month (February 2012), the Greek parliament, literally on the orders of the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, voted to cut the minimum wage a further 20 percent, unilaterally end job security and begin to lay off 150,000 government workers.

It is FXDD’s current plan to continue to offer our U.S. based traders the opportunity to trade Gold and Silver, however, on a 1:1 non-leveraged basis, which will require substantially more margin. If you do not have sufficient margin to cover your open metal positions on a 1:1 basis, you will need to reduce your exposure before 4 P.M. on July 15, or risk all remaining open positions in Gold or Silver being closed out automatically and the remaining balances deposited back into your trading account.

Masha and the sequel, The Youngest Lady in Waiting are inexplicably out of print - and copies are now highly sought by collectors. The hardback that my parents bought for me on my tenth birthday (after I'd borrowed Masha from the library week after week) must be worth about £300 by now. But I’d never sell it. My favourite school story is actually my favourite book of all.
Not so for me. Sometimes home-construction tasks will turn the trick, but these can also become so demanding that they take up too much of my all-too-limited brainpower. Gardening works well sometimes, but not always, and that old standby, the shower, sometimes produces results--but one can only spend so long in the shower.

Unfortunately, sitting with my back to the cityscape that is exactly like the cityscape in your local-international-chain coffee shop makes it nearly impossible for me not to stare in disbelief. Honestly, I get the the cappuccino thing. There a plenty of places that only serve espresso, and if you don't know the lingo you may well think that cappuccino is the easiest way to obtain something white coffee like (ask for an americano with warm milk or cold). And really the prices are higher than the grocery store, but you're rather getting a different product and you're paying over the odds because you choose to. And really, I've yet to identify someone who was actually confused by the queue location rather than being unwilling to admit that they were trying to jump the queue altogether.

Have you ever heard that joke that Final Fantasy games are generic stories that revolve around protecting crystals, orbs, or whatever. Well, Its my belief that Final Fantasy 5 started this joke. This is the simpliest story i’ve ever played in all the time i’ve spent on RPG’s. The Story begins with the Wind crystal in danger. You play Bartz, a young lad that is pulled into an adventure to protect the crystals by Lenna, princess of the land and Galuf, an old man found next to a meteorite with amnesia. Venturing forward, you meet a pirate captain, Faris, that joins your party and you set off to protect the crystals.
You will build up confidence and resilience. You will start to know yourself as someone who takes risks and challenges themselves. And it is just amazing how the illusion of fear can disintegrate when we push through and stare it in the face!
The role of international and domestic media will be to exacerbate these trends by airing arguments, concerns and confusions that will encourage insurgents and alarm Afghan and international domestic populations. In October 2008, US Defence Secretary Robert Gates correctly points out that:
It wasn’t just about Trev today, I think I felt more emotional because 17 years ago I went to my first ever funeral, never knowing what to expect, my auntie June had passed away on the 23rd April that year, 1995, she too had the songs “Morning has broken”, she too had chosen ‘All things bright and beautiful”, so it brought back the memory of her loss, also the family had chosen R.E.Ms ‘Everybody hurts‘ another song that I used to listen to as I had been in college at the time and I was a big R.E.M fan. Trev made sure I never forgot her, she was more important to me as an inspirational person than anybody other than my parents of course.
In response to Captain Alex Alexander’s allegations of corruption and his suspension as a means to gag him following his discovery of corruption within the department, spokesman Senior Superintendent Marinda Mills yesterday confirmed that Capt Alexander was suspended without salary, but not for the reasons he had given.
This is the song I sang to my husband Alex yesterday as he was working on some project on the computer. Now, I also did a little hula dance for him at the same time. If you don't know the song, the name "Pupule" is pronounced "Poo Poo Ly". So it is more lyrical than it would be if it was pronounced "Poo Pool", isn't it?
The cause of collapse is a virus with an additional mix of elements from the medieval black death. If you note that one of her favorite writers listed is Connie Willis, and one of Ms. Willis' better books is Dooms Day Book, which involves a time traveling historian who (somewhat accidentally) gets trapped in Medieval England during a breakout of the plague, that admixture is likely not accidental.

The other morning, I received an email from one of my readers. It began, “I just read your novel Into The Wilderness and I absolutely loved it as I really connected with it.” This reader explained how she grew up in New York City and was now married to a man from New Zealand, where they’d just spent the last year. They were back in the states with their four children, but she was in a quandary: the New Zealand lifestyle was better, she thought, but her children had better educational opportunities here. She signed off asking me what she should do: “Would love your advice if you have a chance to give it!”

﻿I have a deep drawer full of kitchen towels. When I find cute ones on clearance or at a yard sale I can't pass them up. There are a handful of towels though that get more use than any others - my linen ones. They don't leave lint and they're great for just about anything except drying. I slide my homemade pizza off the screen and onto one of these towels for cutting; they're lightweight enough to cover dough when it's rising; and they work great for squeezing juice out of berries or grapes when making jelly.
That’s all I think about after sampling this forgettable lager. I have to confess that I was drawn in by the neck label that reads, “Celebrating the repeal of prohibition 1933.”
I don’t remember who the Sox were playing that night. I think it was the Texas Rangers because I remember Jose Canseco was in right field. When the game was over, we went back to my friend’s house and watched SportsCenter. And when the Sox highlights came up, there we were, my son and I, right behind home plate. I’m sure that during the game, someone saw my son bust my lip, when, in a bit of 3-year-old craziness, he lurched back and drove his head into my mouth.

My project consists of a print made from a collage of digital photographs framed behind a door. It is displayed juxtaposed over a video projected onto a screen door showing each layer of that same print being added to it. The video is over 16 minutes long incorporating twelve different layers. The changes between layers is slow so that at first it doesn’t appear that anything is happening but if the viewer waits long enough or comes back after leaving the piece, they will find that the image has changed.

1. A Thai-New Zealand family adapted to the heat visited Dokmai Garden yesterday (those of you who stay indoors now do not know what you miss). They bought many plants and thanks to the sharp eyes of the eldest son we registered the 12th snake species at Dokmai Garden: the golden tree snake (Chrysopelea ornata). This is a gliding snake which can flatten itself and glide from one tree to another. It showed us its agility by swiftly slither through a golden dew drop bush and then almost straight up into our entrance mango. Just the other day I remarked it would be so great to have this snake in the garden. It is not venomous, beautiful, large (130 cm), it can ‘fly’ and it kills rodents. How do you separate it from other green snakes, some of which are poisonous? The head, body and tail is black and green. Other green snakes may have a red tail and/or a uniformly green head. If there is a photographer who is not afraid of the heat, most welcome to take a picture of this snake!

Ponder these first few points for a while, then I'll talk about how to get good results on glossy. For my comparison today I used the stamp Dr. Pea-Nut from Our Craft Lounge. I colored him first on glossy paper, the second time I colored him on some regular absorbent paper. Notice how very different each color looks between the two images and how layering the same color shows up so much more on the glossy than it does on the other paper. Stamped with Memento Tuxedo black ink (let it dry well on glossy).
The room smelled like disinfectant it permeated the walls, the floors it clung to the bed linings and saturated the air with its heavy scent. One lone window illuminated the tiny room a metal cage covering it prevented the occupant from dispelling the sharp odor. Soft sobs carried through the wall from the room next door. Down the hall, someone screamed a long tortured cry. A never-ending confusion of noise echoed along the dimly lit corridors of Danvers State Insane Asylum. Established in 1878 the State Lunatic Hospital at Danvers was situated in a rural out of the way location North of Boston. Sitting atop Hawthorn Hill it’s sprawling 500 hundred acres of brick and mortar housed close to two thousand patients.

Teal: Miles 1-6, I felt awesome. The rain was bad but not too bad, I was cold but not too cold and my feet were still relatively dry and we were both hanging with the 4:15 pacer, which I know now was WAY too fast for at least me. About the end of 6 maybe sooner my feet were officially crazy soaked from running through puddles. The theory of “you are already wet, it doesn’t matter” is bogus. It does matter, it adds so much more weight when you step in a pile than from just running. My feet were starting to get heavy.

There are of course exceptions. CalPERS, CalSTRS, MOSERS, and a few others stand out in my mind but the bulk of U.S. pension funds are poorly governed. For example, Chris Tobe sent me an article on Maryland paying excessive fees for currency management to reduce volatility. For pure currency hedging, they are better off using Montreal's Fjord Capital. I guarantee you they wouldn't have gotten raped on fees and they would have received much better results.

All of this to say that I can't ever order anything with pesto in it when I go out to eat. More than likely it will be made with pine nuts. However, nothing can stop me from having pesto at home.

Other demands on my time have made posting here rather spotty, but I have always tried to keep notes on possible posts for when some time appears.

I am complying with yesterday’s request from Miss G for a van for V week at preschool. It didn’t seem all that exciting to me, but if she’ll eat it I’m in.

I have seen these many different places on the internet and liked the idea so I checked some out and found out the size is about 5 X 7. This one is exactly that size, I used muslin layered over a cotton batting, just turning the top over to give me somewhere to put it on the flag holder out front. The fabric in the middle is some that I sun dyed last summer, then I added embroidery to it.

Poetry is about expressing something, not about making sure every line or every other line rhymes and adheres to a scheme. Schemes are great for practise but don’t allow yourself to be too restrained by them as a concept. Similarly if you prefer to rhyme don’t feel that you have to write free verse. What works for you is what works for you, just remember to consider the rhythm when writing poetry.

Sometimes, we are like those disciples. Jesus told us exactly what is going to happen. He said we would have trouble in this world (John 16:33), but he also told us not to let our hearts be troubled (John 14:1). Living in a world of sin, we will experience sorrow and grief. But living in faith in Jesus Christ, those sorrows and griefs are not the final word. They are not as real as the great reality that is coming for those who trust Jesus. The pain and severe disappointment experienced by those disciples walking along the road was real. But the man walking beside them was real too, and he had already overcome their grief, even before they were aware of it. The reality of his resurrection was greater than the reality of their sorrow, whether they knew it or not.

The Result
I remember one day as I was pulling up and parking behind my duck blind, I noticed the aforementioned CHP motor, El Guapo stopped on the offramp giving some unlucky motorist a ticket. So you'd think that with a CHP motor cop on the offramp giving someone a ticket you'd see no violations being committed at this particular spot right? Wrong.

As I tie my shoes and put on a faded baseball cap I can hear my boat calling to me from the shed. “Let’s go out on the lake” my boat calls to me like the Sirens calling Homer in the Iliad. “I can’t, I have to mow the lawn” I reply. My boat also senses my desire to go fishing so it makes suggestions such as spraying Roundup all over the yard so I won’t have mow ever again. I think it is a great idea but I decide against it. It is amazing how a boat can corrupt your way of thinking and lead you astray.

And another thing: In addition to saying this would be a “tough” game, Pardew described it as a “key, key game.” This linguistic device has hitherto tended to be used in the football community chiefly to describe players as being “top, top”. Can any linguistics experts out there confirm that what we are witnessing is an emerging epidemic of epizeuxis?
I recently stumbled upon this book while researching educational concepts for young children. This book was highly recommended to me by a number of parents. Ideal for children ages 2-5; this book is reminiscent of the old classic Chicka Chicka Boom Boom, by Bill Martin Jr.

The point is, receiving and acting on a complaint or suggestion and making things right with that customer, if needed, is only part of the process. Demonstrating that you are transparent, honest, open to criticism and actually responsive is the other part of the process – and it’s the part that can help you to gain ground with not just one customer, but many.

Canon EOS 40D Digital Camera Review – One Workhorse of a Camera
Though Riot Grrls at Evergreen State no doubt took political stances, these came through music, community, and style more than formal political protest. When Hanna and members of Bikini Kill and Bratmobile decamped for Washington D.C., one might argue the nation’s capital provided the ideal space for diffusion of their burgeoning political message. Once in town, the Pac NW Riot Grrrls fell in with a collection of punks connected to the legendary Nation of Ulysses, Fugazi, and Positive Force. Rather than universities, the Embassy, a local group house in the D.C. neighborhood of Mt. Pleasant and the Positive Force House in Arlington, VA provided spaces for politicization.
After all the sunny weather we had in April and May, it's not so easy to go back to the typical Parisian weather -- cool and gray being the order of the day, pretty much any time of year. But after being cooped up in the house much of last week, I didn't care what the weather was when Friday rolled around. My friend had promised to take me on a tour of street art and how could I say no to that?

Both again coloured using inks. The one one the right has been covered in Versamark ink and triple embossed with clear embossing powder and edge with a gold Krylon pen. All of the shapes have been cut with nestabilities and layered. The main card has been cut using the largest of the shapes. Because these have been printed off small you could have a colouring evening and get a load done ready for matting and layering and that’s your Christmas cards done. When colouring any image choose your papers first and choose colours to go with the papers, its alot easier than trying to rummage through your paper stash to find a papers to go with the colours you have used.
It was a strange diversion for the band to record a novelty song considering how serious they were about their music overall. I can't imagine anyone in the group was really good natured about the Reagan's, but humor is the greatest way lampoon the powerful.

Zach's styling of each cocktail was impressive. He even surprised us by changing the beer ingredient in the French 75, which was supposed to be Sun King Sunlight Cream Ale but was instead New Albanian's Elsa Von Horizon Imperial Pilsner. While the cream ale version that Gina and I tested before the event was delicious, the hop zing of the Elsa added extra sass to the drink's citrus and sugar notes.

This year, 10,000 Bosniaks from North America and Bosnia and Herzegovina will gather in Bowling Green between May 25 and May 27. The convention will feature a variety of social, music, culinary, religious and athletic events coupled with the dedication of the new Bosnian Islamic Center on Blue Level Road in Bowling Green.

It would be erroneous to think that the displays of heightened sagacity from which we have derived the taxonomic appellation for our species (Homo sapiens sapiens) is not only holistically capable of the fullest articulation in each of us by virtue of our birth. Logically only something living can die, but what of someone imprisoned in the depth of a captivating somnolence where the appearance of living supplants in believability the actual experience of living
So, as I was sitting chatting with a friend, this young man comes up and asks me to dance. I've never seen him before, I had not seem him dance yet (it was the beginning of the night), and he was not wearing dance shoes. hum. I very politely said "Thank you, but not right now." He then nodded towards my friend, who was now involved in a conversation with the person on the other side of her, and said "How about your friend?"
Okay, I've to warn you all to be ready for the next picture because it was taken right after I got out of bed and before applying makeup. I'm gonna show you the differences on my face - with and without the product.
Anyway, from there I started writing my speech. I had never in the 20 years since my sis died actually wrote "the story" of what our family went thru. No one had ever really heard what it was like for us in our community. A great amount of tears came with writing my speech, but it was good tears. Ones that I probably had held back for many years. I was able to take my anger and put it to use in a positive way. I then gave my speech to Chad to read. I couldn't even read it to him, because of how vulnerable I felt. It took me many times reading it on my own before I was able to read it out loud. I gave the speech to my friend and we setup the 1st class I would come to speak for.
And I had such a lovely time. It was perfect. Almost.

Yesterday a lovely young lady came in excited because she had gotten a job after a long search. She'd just been hired as a waitress and needed white tops to wear for her uniform. She brought her darling little three year old daughter who was wearing great big white bug-eye sunglasses and a smile which matched the size of her glasses. How fun it was to help them scour the racks for white tops - - - we found 7. She's off and running on her way to being able to support herself once again.

The first section on ENGA1 is called Language and Mode, so you'd have to be a mug not to mention it, but what is it? At its simplest, mode is basically the way language passes from text producer to text receiver. So, that can be via the visual channel in the form of written texts, or the aural channel in the form of spoken texts.Simples, no?

Normally, this is where I might summon a manager for assistance. But I wasn’t sure that’s what they called them anymore. What if they were now called “shift captains”? Or “team leaders”? Or “Purveyors and Expediters of an Exquisite Customer Experience”?
I had to change gears, but it all came back really quickly, and we started off with the things I’d done well, before moving to the things I could work on in the next draft. She loved Ellie as a character, and said I’d gotten her voice just right for a 12-year-old girl. She also loved Teddy the stuffed dog as a character, because I’d infused him with all the personality that he has in Ellie’s eyes. And some of my imagery was unique and well done, to boot, so apparently I am off to a good start.
Next we visited the Mine Action Visitor Center that has the dual purpose of educating outsiders about the problems of UXOs, and the more important task as a field-trip destination for every school child in Quang Tri Province to educate them about the dangers of UXOs in the hood.
My Daily 5 reading plans haven't really worked out like I had hoped. I honestly haven't even attempted to build any reading stamina or do much independent reading. I have several students with autism that have a very, very hard time focusing and paying attention. They have a hard time focusing during guided reading and direct instruction. I'm spending a lot of time redirecting and prompting them to stay on task even when we're at the small group table, and I can't imagine them being able to focus enough for independent reading. I guess I've been afraid that it would be an impossibility for these students. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions? Should I try it anyway? If you have ANY tips for helping keep these students on task or focused, I would greatly appreciate it!

Journalists would have you believe they’re all Woodward and Bernstein–championing what’s right, inveighing against corruption and injustice, always seeking to break that earth-shattering news story–when in fact most are lazy and unimaginative, and prefer just repeating the same old thing all their colleagues are doing. They like nothing better than digging some old story out of their archives, dusting it off, and slapping on a new title, confident that the public’s collective attention span barely stretches back into the last news cycle.
Even more astounding than the view that there might be some kind of artificial structures on the moon, is the theory that the moon itself might actually be an artificial structure. That’s right. There are people who believe that the moon itself is some kind of giant spaceship. This view was first expounded by two Soviet scientists in the 1970s then later picked up and expanded on by Don Wilson in his book Our Mysterious Spaceship Moon.

Clearly Derek Clark is not just a corrupt, disloyal odious and cowardly waste of money but it seems from his record he is a total waste of space but holding public office when he clearly has no skills or ability to offer is hardly sensible as he approaches 80 - especially a job that is so physically demanding if he tries to acquit his duty in view of the travel and hours!

MP3s work for me. And I like listening to music on YouTube or any other convenient cloud-based service that places as much data as possible within easy, unfettered reach. I dislike the fetishizing of the past – this displaced lamenting of the loss of physical media because it’s easier than lamenting the loss of youth… I see culture as the primary medium for the communication of complicated ideas between people. Milton couldn’t communicate the content of Paradise Lost without referring extensively to the Greek myths that constituted the allusory framework that he shared with his audience. Today, we can’t assume that everyone’s familiar with the canon of world literature but, by referring to the music (among other things) that we have a shared experience of listening to we can communicate better and more efficiently. Using the cloud as a record collection most enables that process so I like that. Something like mobile Spotify (with more consistent mobile internet) would be my ideal – but not actually Spotify because it takes far too long to get non-traditional releases onto it – which I assume was a compromise they made with the labels, but which seems wholly counterintuitive to me, and means there’s rarely anything I want to listen to on it that I couldn’t have found faster in my browser.

Roll the ball until it's about the size of A4 paper. Again, handle it as lightly as you can. Roll confidently and don't overwork. Don't see-saw the rolling pin back and forth; that develops the gluten again and makes things chewy and sticky. Fold the dough into thirds, like you were folding a letter to go in an envelope. Turn it ninety degrees. Roll out to the same size again, fold in thirds, and repeat this process two more times.
In an echo of what the lepers might have cried to God, we read the Psalmist’s plea: “I cried to you for help, and you have healed me” (30:2). In both of today’s stories, recovery marks the end of God’s wrath and acknowledges that God’s favor endures for a lifetime. Weeping in the night has been transformed into joy in the morning. The sackcloth of mourning has been replaced with clothes of joy.

Hydrogenated/Partially Hydrogenated Fats: during food processing, some fats go through a chemical alteration know in the industry as hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is basically where hydrogen is chemically injected into the fat oils at high temperatures. Food companies add hydrogenated fats to foods to make them more stable in order to increase their shelf lives. A twinkie’s shelf life is reported to be 27 years! That’s ridiculous! And probably an urban myth, Hostess (the makers of Twinkies) say the shelf life is more around 25 days, but others say they’ve seen Twinkies that are 25 years old and could very possibly still be eaten! Hydrogenated oils are proven to raise levels of your LDL cholesterol (the bad type!) and leads to an increased risk

By way of a further explanation, the term cooking lager derives from the term cooking sherry. Sherry is a delightful drink of wine and brandy from the Jerez region of Spain that was once popular and arguably deserves to be again. It suffers from an image problem. It’s an old ladies drink, and what keeps many old ladies going is cooking sherry. Cheap sherry from Cyprus or even Blighty, nominally bought for cooking, but often necked. Thus “cooking” mean cheap, and occasionally nasty.

To top it off I proceed to blog about it with a post titled, "Pimp My Locker". Wow.

We went on an excursion to a bog close to where we live. We had never heard of it before and it doesn't seem to be a very well visited place, since there wasn't even a parking lot, you just had to park at the side of the gravel road that went by the path. The bog doesn't really fit into the surroundings, since it's mostly farm lands. That made it extra special, since it was like coming to the north of Sweden for a little while. The weather was stunning.

You keep significantly more property in your RV than you do in your car, some of which can be valuable like laptops, televisions, and other equipment. When your house on wheels is parked at a campsite, the area around it can be considered your “yard” which makes you liable for things that happen there. There isn’t really a situation where your car could be thought to have its own yard. If your RV is damaged while you are on the road, you will need somewhere else to stay just like you would if your house was damaged.

Don´t think I ever traded this one back in the day, so this is a bit of a premiere. Hope you all will enjoy this nice little piece of music history. And please don´t share this one in any lossy format.

Some believe that the wedding band originated in ancient Egypt along with the belief that the fourth finger (counting the thumb) on the left hand contained a vein that is connected directly to the heart. Therefore, that finger became the ring finger, the finger connected to love and marriage. This is still known as the ring finger in most parts of the world. However, in Norway and Russia the wedding band is worn on the same finger though on the right hand instead of the left.

The crisis in Greece has a very strong psychological component – all classes of the society were irritated by the unscrupulous tolerance by the state to corruption and disloyalty to the state. This situation cannot be overcome with revolutionary means, which is very characteristic for the current political culture in Greece. Only by establishing and respecting the principles of a state of law can save Greece, and not a policy of Breaking Dawns or Golden Dawns…
Pop was the most organized person I knew. He loved books, crosswords and the morning paper. In later years he connected to the internet. He never really stopped learning.
Ballad Of A Thin Man
Sunday was wonderful to all attend church as a family. And it was really nice to have 2 adults to keep the boys in line! William enjoyed seeing many of his friends again and showing off his just-barely-long-enough-to-comb hair. He's counting down the days until school starts and even has his clothes picked out for the day. Recently, he has commented several times that he wished the summer was over so school would start. Perhaps I need to record that one on camera!

You can purchase Epitaphs, the first anthology created by the NEHW, which includes only stories by members. Longo’s story, “Private Beach,” which is reminiscent of Stephen King’s story, “The Raft,” is in this inaugural collection. This anthology also includes a story by Christopher Golden, who has written a number of Buffy the Vampire Slayer books, and Rick Hautala, the recent recipient of the Horror Writers Association’s 2012 Bram Stoker Award for Lifetime Achievement.

All this is to show how easily YOU, or any of us can find ourselves or someone we care about in prison. Once there, wouldn’t you want your friend, husband, daughter or parent to be treated with the decency that you know they deserve? Because once that face in the Daily Mail is not just a rough looking stranger, once it’s your dad, your girlfriend, your son, you might begin to see that many rough looking strangers are someone’s loved one too – and all of them are someone’s child.

The traditional post museum reward – ice cream sundaes – out of the way, we headed to the Cathedral area for more exciting noodle/dumpling/soup dishes and phenomenal coffee. Both of us are complete coffee addicts and while the coffee so far has been pretty good we haven’t managed to find anything to rival the creamy flat whites at Battambang’s fave café Kinyei. The coffee in Hanoi was out of this world amazing – the two specialities – iced coffee with yoghurt, and coffee with egg white were both a million times better than they sound. We drank cups and cups of these in various tiny cafes hidden high above the streets of Vietnam, overlooking the lake, with cats purring by our side – bliss.

N- detects in ‘community values’ or ‘the utility of the herd’, a situation at once self-contradictory and absurd. He does not think that one can have a genuine situation of ‘neighbor love’ in a communal situation, as love is one of the ‘strong drives’ and can only be embodied by a ‘high and independent’ spirit. Opposed to this, N- thinks, is the society which values community, as this can only be founded in a system of ‘neighbor fear’, fear that one’s neighbor might do something: either become ‘criminal’ or conversely, do something to ‘rise above’ the herd; both of which are considered ‘immoral’ to a communal society. I think he sees this as the way most people run most (modern) societies most of the time, and his chief critique of these types of living arrangements are that it stultifies. That it considers that which he values (will to power, etc.) as criminal, as ‘branded and slandered most’. ‘Everything that elevates and individual above teh herd and intimidates the neighbor is henceforth called evil.’ That they co-opt and abuse moral rhetoric to enforce their ‘peaceful conditions’, and above all their ‘mediocrity‘. In such a society, only a ‘sheep, gains in respect’. These societies seem to N- to consider as their imperitive ‘”we want that some day there should be nothing any more to be afraid of!”…is now called “progress”.’ N-’s tastes appear to run counter.
This year’s theme “Hawaii Calls” with the hapa haole songs of the first half of the 20th century was particularly refreshing. The opening song “Hawaiian Lullaby” gave me chicken skin as the children and staff surrounding me sang of the exact reasons that Hawaii calls to me every day. What a pleasure to feel that call today from these children.

Life was not meant to be lived on autopilot. Heighten your sensitivity to the plight of the lost. View almost every conversation as a possible opportunity for ministry, especially when dealing with the unsaved. Your anger or unkind disposition will never achieve God’s righteous purpose, so keep defensive attitudes at bay. Human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires. James 1:20 (NLT) Inspire someone today by caring enough to take time to attentively listen.

She and I spent 2 weeks in Cincinnati. The first week was spent trying to figure her out. What was her problem when she was born? What is her problem now? What can we do for her? After a few tests that were not much fun, it was determined that Gracie was born with hirschsprung's disease. Here's my version of what that is: The nerve endings in Gracie's colon did not completely form, therefore there was a portion of Gracie's colon that could not function. In China, they did surgery to take out the affected portion of colon. The surgery was successful and although there are a couple of things that could cause some issues later (scar tissue, etc.), it's nothing we have to worry about now. Her diagnosis right now is a hyper-motile colon. Her colon works too fast, especially when you eat fruit, etc. Our second week in Cincinnati was spent in bowel management...trying to come up with the right cocktail of drugs to get her colon to slow down. They put her on Citrucel to bulk up her stool and Immodium to slow her colon down. MIRACLE!! I don't think the child had ever had a formed stool...ever! She now goes about 3 times a day, and we don't have the "emergencies" that we used to deal with. It's not perfect. She has days that things don't go quite right, but those are very manageable. I think as she gets older, that part will get easier and easier.

“We’re experienced at accommodating lawful protests and responding appropriately to anyone who engages in unlawful activity, and we’re prepared to do both,” he said in an interview.
It is easy to live a life in New York City with virtually no interaction with children at all. Childless individuals and couples are common and easy to befriend. Some may feel that this is an impoverished life. Others see it as a merely a lifestyle choice and a realization that not everyone is cut out to be a parent. We should be capable of rational, calm dialogue about the subject without character assaults. It should not be the last taboo...
A bit about me- daughter, wife, mom, breast feeding, natural curl having, thinking about naturopathing, licensed social working woman. I am surrounded by love at all times and I smile when I think about it. Four of my loves! (my husband doesn't like to take pictures but there are a couple of him buried somewhere in my posts!) ;)
They say that behind every great man there’s a great woman. It sounds like an outmoded sentiment of stodgy sexists, but even in the 21st-century tech world, it is still true.
Bear in mind that your home should be a place for relaxation and leisure and a safety place for the entire family. If you continue using tap water for washing clothes and your kitchenware, bathing and drinking, then you are keeping your family constantly exposed to health risks. After you have determined the advantages of using a home water filtration system, you can now decide on whether to buy one or not. Be sure to weigh your options well. Although having a water filtration system in your home could indeed be costly upfront, you will be able to benefit a lot from it for many years, thus you are indeed making the most of your investment.
Lesson learned, if you want something --- care about it enough to say YES when if's offered to you. You never know if it will be offered again.

Our lovely Thanksgiving hostess, two years in a row (see last year here). Terri was one of my bosses at AT, and she and her family have been so good to Matt and I since we've been in Chicago. They have hosted us for almost every holiday since we've been here, including two Thanksgivings, Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve, and Easter. I told you they were wonderful. And Terri's cooking? Oh my goodness, it's insane.

Our families of origin, the ones who raised us up or came along for us to raise, are the ones who have roots entwined within our hearts. This week I connected with each of them in some way – talked via Skype, mailed a birthday card, paid bills for some, listened some, and got some good things back. At times we get stuck in a tangle of emotions, shared history and role-playing, but ultimately we love each other fiercely. During a recent family crisis I took charge (as the oldest daughter usually does), but everyone came together to share their strengths and gifts. I’m so proud of how we each worked through our personal expressions of fear and loss to bond together with humor, compassion, and support. Compared to those TV families, we may look unpolished, but each is a family jewel.
FUN SCHOOL – We LOVE our Fun School. It’s probably the best homeschooling decision I’ve made in a long while. It is working so well for us! Here’s the fun we had this week…

But the bitchiness I have experienced from her over the last two years means that I won’t feel bad. I can then move onto a new – hopefully happier – chapter of my life, in a job where I won’t be reminded of my past problems caused by alcohol on a daily basis nor have them used to belittle me and bring me down.
“Well, other people are selling her heroin in higher quantities, so it doesn’t really matter if I stop.”
Gil's song builds rapidly due to its short duration. Still, even after having heard it countless times that second verse is probably one of the more distressing ones I've ever heard in my life: "Did you hear what they said/Did you hear what they said/Did you hear what they said/They said,they shot him in his head/a shot in the head to save his country/a shot in the head to save his country/Come on, come on,come on,come on/this can't be real." Involuntarily, as I listened to these lines, I somehow created an internal debate where on one side I had Scott-Heron's harsh, poetic reality playing against Karen Armstrong's explanation of Nirvana on the other side: "We are told that Nirvana is a permanent, stable, imperishable, immoveable, ageless, deathless, unborn, and unbecome, that it is power, bliss and happiness, the secure refuge, the shelter and the place of unassailable security..." Well, no, it isn't, if you get shot in the head and then can't be buried.
I’m sure I’m not the only one that thinks this. How many projects have you worked on where you thought to yourself “If I only had a little more time I would…?” I always told myself I’d go back and redo the projects that didn’t meet my expectations but of course that hasn’t happened yet. This thought has crept up more frequently as the opportunity for grad school has become a real option in the next couple of years. Is it a misrepresentation to redo a project from college? Shouldn’t a portfolio show a progression of your work or merely a collection of your most successful projects? Would it be better to include new projects I’ve just made up to work on instead of fixing the old ones? These are questions I have been asking myself lately. No matter which direction I go, I need to have the time outside of work to do them.
In 1952, the Government approved the development of Gatwick into a direct alternative airport to Heathrow with a significant investment programme and in 1956 Gatwick closed as building began on ‘the new London Airport.’ The airport cost £7.8 million to build and was officially opened by HM The Queen on 9 June 1958. The ‘new’ Gatwick was the world’s first single facility airport accessible by all modes of transport – air, rail and road.

Today I welcome Ada Brownell, who shares about handling the sting of criticism. While her focus is on what she's learned from critiques and rejections of her writing projects, the principles certainly apply to any types of criticism.
Just to refresh your memory, last week I put up a post bringing back my breakup song contest. The first time I barely got three suggestions. This time, it was an avalanche. Apparently a lot of bad memories have come flooding back to all of you since the first effort.

10. Fade Away
This is kind of a stupid story and it hardly makes any sense. The point is that for whatever reason some folks can’t give up their possessions and the only time they get sold off is after the primary person dies.
And so I sucked it in, mustered the courage to enter the netherworld of the internet. And there they were, oodles of tom-dick-and-harries, awaiting their turn for a come-hither wink from a lonesome, crotchety old woman who may or may not give it up after a nervous respite to include perhaps three dinners, two movies and a hand-holding session on the couch. Short ones tall ones black ones brown ones…mostly glassy-eyed white pricks rubbing their well-oiled bottoms on their banana-seated harleys, tickling their big doggy tummies, exposing their wolfy teeth to the women of the netherworld.

They even partook of the Holy Communion strictly meant only for Catholics, which adherents of the faith treat with utmost reverence.

Darkthrone released one more complete black metal album in 2004 called Sardonic Wrath. In 06 they released a seminal album entitled The Cult is Alive. This was produced and recorded in Peaceville Records. This new album also came with some new style, a black punk type of style. This is a stylistic change that would well suit the band and continue on to this day. Darkthrone has released three more albums since the change of musical style. All the albums have been very similar, but they all have small differences in style.

The most popular cultural idols dominating Mexican movies, television and music, romanticize the narco lifestyle while depicting thugs as heroes. Young people who’ve known only poverty see working for the cartels as a golden opportunity. It’s the only possible way to acquire fame, fortune, prestige, power and respect. It’s the only way open to them to escape privation and live in huge fancy houses, drive huge fancy vehicles, wear huge fancy jewelry, and live huge fancy lives like the glamorous ricos they see swaggering and preening on Mexican T.V. and in the movies.Imitating the narco lifestyle has spread from Mexico and Latin America throughout the Hispanic communities of the U.S. and Canada.
After Dan, Brandon took the stage. He used Dan’s amp (vintage Princeton Reverb) which made his sax playing sound a heck of a lot warmer. Brandon is a good player, and used a lot of delay and loops.

We strongly consider it, as we wing our way north, dodging summer storms all the way home to Nashville. Each time we journey to Cedar Key, we stay a day or two longer than we’d planned: Unpredictable coastal weather usually provides a worthy excuse to wait another day. Besides, the treasures of this place take time to discover, unlike showier destinations with more obvious attractions. After a few days here, you’ll adjust to a new pace. Maybe you’ll decide you don’t have to be back on Monday morning after all.
The master suite is on the second floor and consists of a huge bath with custom shower, two sinks, and an enormous walk in closet and skylights which flood the stairwell leading up with natural light.

Acreage, Farm/Ranch (All MLS Counties) - The total number of properties categorized as Farm/Ranch sold in the 2nd quarter of 2009 declined 30.95% (42 in '08 vs. 29 in '09). Average prices and DOM tend to be less significant in this category as the properties offered and sold vary tremendously. Most notably, total sales volume has decreased by 45.6% from 2nd quarter 2008 vs. 2nd quarter 2009.

As the chart above shows, September 30 would be a great time to look for this comet because it will be so near the Alpha star of Cassiopeia – the “W.” Each day it continues in a generally eastward direction. The red circle is a 5-degree field, typical for 10X50 binoculars. (Your binoculars may show a larger field of view.) The comet enters near the top of the circle on October 6, is at the position shown on October 7, and will be exiting the circle at the bottom (eastern side) on October 8. On October 12 it will be about four degrees north of Mirfak. Remember – to find north in the sky just draw a line between a star and Polaris – in this case between Mirfak and Polaris – Comet Hartley should be pretty close to such an imaginary line on October 12.
If Bolt's 9.69 classified him as an alien, then the 5' 11" Gay must also have alien DNA as only Bolt's 9.58 in Berlin is faster than today's dash down the track by Gay. With Bolt himself having shut his season down, today's 100 was another showdown between the #'s 2 & 3 fastest sprinters in history - Tyson Gay (9.71) and Asafa Powell (9.72) - and the race did not disappoint.
I don’t know how to change this. The neighbors who surround me are strangers. They speak the same language as me but for some reason this makes it all the more difficult. I am not good at loving these people. It has been easier to stereotype them, to “tut, tut” under my breath, to walk quickly into the apartment and not engage in what is taking place in the doorways around me.
One friend didn't show up but sent an apologetic text explaining how a rather unpleasant stomach bug made it imperative for her to be within 10 feet of a toilet at all times, and also demanding a full description of Wolverine's bum (and preferably his "meat and two veg") when we got to that glorious part of the film. I sent her a text back suggesting it would be detrimental to her recovery to get too excited and therefore refused to meet her demands, good friend that I was and having only her welfare in mind. I won't say what she sent back, it wasn't terribly polite.

There was no wall to tear down in Moscow, but symbolic acts abounded: Russian flags replaced the Soviet; Dzerzhinsky and Stalin fell from their pedestals and gathered in a park, a garden of ghostly stone. (Someone had painted red fangs on Papa Joe.) Streets, parks, and metro stations lost their old names—Gorky fell out of favor once again and lost his namesakes. Imagine the comedy of Russian students trying to grasp directions to places undergoing a politio-linguistic transformation that didn’t always match the current signage.
I thought about just working in specific kitchens for a bit, but I was worried that knowing the addictiveness of the kitchen – I understand that any promises of 8 hour days are essentially lies. Being thrown in a role of responsibility basically means that there are no days that are less than 12 hours – whether you’re paid for 8 or not. And, knowing my junkie nature with working, I was sure to be hooked on for 6 day weeks at 12+ hour clips once again. Something that would not be helpful with my current disposition. A new kitchen would also mean that I would likely have no time to develop new concepts, leads and ideas for Dux (on break but in the works) and other things I still wanted to do.

I love my husband and my beautiful children dearly. They are smart, obedient, caring and compassionate. I do not regret the choices that I have made. I have realized that we have been brought together for a very important reason. I just don’t know what it is yet, but I am learning. My life has been turned upside down with the truth, and I am trying to read and learn all I can. I used to blame my liberal white friends for living in the expensive suburbs and worrying about “safe schools”, but now I have great compassion for them. I too long for a safe and friendly place to raise my children.
i woke to find a wonderful text from my friend jana. just a beautiful affirmation kind of out of the blue text. it helped me to wake up from the freakiness of that dream and i wrote back to simply say thanks but found myself in a halfsleep telling her about what i've been feeling: "i have been in a very isolated space lately and most everything i do right now is obligation. i am trying to heal something deep and learning to take the time to do it is hard. i am blessed with amazing women like you in my life who accept me for just me. trying not to feel like i have to be more than that is hard. thank you for reminding me of what IS." the thing is, nothing about my life right now is hard, but there are things that i try to work through while also navigating this amazing, very full and happy life and that can be daunting.

So OGE and I are on a work road trip with NAE and we’ve ended up in Canton, Mississippi. There isn’t much going on here by the way. We’re at a Hampton Inn that is right down the road from a ghetto looking Mexican place. We decided to go there for dinner tonight because we both love Mexican food and margaritas. This place was so close that we put the baby in the stroller and walked. It took about two minutes.

Georgian architectural styles eventually evolved into other styles – Gothic, Victorian Gothic, Richardson Romanesque, Colonial, Georgian, Neo-Classical, Greek Revival, Victorian, etc. But regardless of the architectural forms and decorative details, one overriding recognizable element of the church building remained…the steeple. The steeple establishes the church as an important visual focus of the community, and it literally draws the eye upwards to heaven. But the importance of the church steeple was not limited to visibility. The tall steeple was often used to house a large bell in its “belfry”. Bells were located high in the steeple, as a call to the community for worship, to ring the time of day, as a wedding peal, and as a solemn funeral toll.

And another thing, why blame the media for ‘leaking their tactics’ when the police could have opted to say nothing whenever interviewed? Why let the media in on their plans? The thing lacking here is procedure as Santiago mentioned in his statement.

I would like to endorse Caryl’s position (disclosure: Caryl spoke to me when he was writing the piece) and offer my own personal view that NATO’s intervention in Libya was a mistake (Caryl does not state this view and my views on that point are mine alone). I felt at the time of the intervention that it was a bad move and I believe subsequent events have added weight to that perspective. It is important to assess the outcome of the intervention in Libya both for an understanding of events in North Africa and the Sahel but also because future interventions will be debated, and undertaken, some of them on the premise that Libya represents a success.

This film really deserves to be distributed and shown widely as it offers a sympathetic vision of a truly innovative artist. If you get to see it, you will have a rare treat.
My husband and I took a research trip to England, where we visited the different places where Catherine lived, the halls where she danced, the palace where she was arrested, and the Tower where she awaited her execution. We searched for her ghost at Hampton Court, where she supposedly haunts a particular gallery shrieking Henry’s name. I didn’t have any ghostly encounters (this is probably for the best, for both of us) but I did visit her grave at the Tower of London, which was a powerful experience. Anne Boleyn gets many visitors and many flowers; Catherine Howard does not. But we were there for her, and we like to feel that her spirit appreciated our efforts.

The worst days of these colds have been on weekends so far, and I'm also sending her back sooner this time. Last year I think I may have kept her home longer than necessary - or maybe this year I'm sending her back too soon - but I'm sending her when she's got her energy and hasn't had a fever for 24+ hours, etc. It's all good. I'm hoping for a better winter but it looks like she will probably get the diagnosis this winter of mild asthma. The last pediatrician we saw (last week - not her doctor - we had to see whoever had an open appointment that morning) pretty much said it sounds like she's mildly asthmatic.
Now I'm just getting silly. . .

Tension between Mkhwanazi and Mdluli, who attended some of the sessions, was palpable as the acting commissioner seemed reluctant to allow the CID boss a turn to speak in the committee. It has been suggested that Mkhwanazi was angered by the political interference in police matters – and is believed to have threatened to resign if Mdluli returned to work.

Wednesday, July 13th 2011, 4:00 a.m. We are in the truck and ready to go. Mike comes inside to do one last check only to find Braelyn sobbing like crazy at the bottom of the stairs. It took a minute to get out of the door, but we did. We left our sad little girl with mom at 4:00 a.m. and there was no turning back! Kristie gave us the genius idea of grabbing the blankets from the airplane and using them for the beach. So we did, and it worked perfect for us! (No, I didn't feel at all bad or guilty, after all if I had checked in any bags it would have cost me an extra $30). Our flights were just about perfect and we landed in Kauai at 11:00 a.m. We went to the car rental and switched our convertible to a Jeep Wrangler (I forgot how fun those are!) Neither of us could wipe the smiles off of our faces. The drive to Kauai Beach Resort was just minutes away so we checked right in and were so excited about the view (I'm posting all pictures later.) With no itinerary or places to be, we just got in the car and drove. We ate some pizza (was not that good) and then drove down to Poi Pu Beach and hung out. We were in complete awe with that drive. Little did we know that it would only get better and better as the week went on. After the beach we drove to Spouting Horn and watched as the waves crashed into the rocks. Then we found ourselves watching the sunset at Salt Pond Beach. Both of us were pretty tired so we came back to our room and went to bed.

And finish up the school year here. Oh, and I am signed up to teach a summer class, ending June 29th, and have a story draft due for a Christmas anthology by May 24. How long does the story need to be? About 20,000 words. How much is written? About 4,000 words. How much time do I have to write these days? Not so much.
I have said this before but the moment that I found out I was pregnant my life, my world changed. Nothing in the world could ever compare to the love I have for my son, and the love that I have for my family. I cant for a minute imagine what I would do or how I would feel if they were taken away form me.
In one reported instance, a pilot died because he was flying with the chin strap loosened on his helmet. When the plane got into trouble and he had to exit it, the loose chin strap enabled his head to snap back so hard and so far that it broke his neck. Whether or not the parachute deployed thereafter was immaterial. Does life and death come down to this—a loose chin strap? What’s the big picture?

And, I’m going to have my say about Rome’s hit on Horton. It was not a dirty hit. It was a hard hit. And it was awful to watch Horton laying on the ice with his arms straight out in the air before him, signalling that he had taken a severe injury to his brain. But Rome’s intent was not to injure, it was simply to finish his check. It was open ice and both players were skating very fast and very hard. When Horton hit the ice, his head took one hell of a knock. Thank God for helmets.
I walked through the kitchen this morning and what do I see laying on the table??? This cookbook. I asked Erik, "Are you kidding me?" Why does he need this cookbook? He told me that there is a recipe for Possum stew in there I want to try. WHAT?! I informed him that I am never eating anything he cooks again. Ew.

For until my late teens, my mother did not insist on a wet grinder - a heavy duty appliance for tough grinding! She had a domestic help who did the grinding on the traditional mortor, we call attukkal or kallural. We were asked to lend a hand sometimes too. In fact, during holidays in our grand parents home, these were considered fun activities for girls and boys alike!

All of us have, I think, a little bit of the crow in us, the greedy raven. A little part that is attracted to shiny things, sparkling in the light.

Hard to resist all of these beautiful shiny things from Redemption Art, Absolutely Kismet and GMaEllen Crochet Gifts.

The boys chased and jostled each other through the wrecks, ignoring the decrepit and rusted shells in favor of examining the more intact ones. Soon they came upon the ghost of a red Camero. The engine was gutted, the wheels gone but, except for the gaping hole where the radio used to be, the interior was still cherry; at least it was cherry enough for them. Broken glass and empty crack vials crunched under their feet as they settled into the seats.

Baked Chicken Breast Strips with Steamed Vegetables for dinner tonight. It would be hard to find an easier dinner to make than this. I used Pilgrim’s Southern Style Breast Strips that I baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. I love these Chicken Strips not only are they easy to prepare but delicious also! At only 190 calories and 17 carbs per serving you can a bit extra and still not have a lot of calories and carbs. i prefer these over Tyson or any other brand of frozen chicken. These taste better than any other brand in my opinion. I served them with a side of JB’S Fat Boy Sticky Stuff BBQ Sauce.

Even when the spider is finally vanquished, its legacy lasts far too long. Gunderson and Solis are wracked by its poison, despite administration of antitoxin and healing magics.

Last night I was reading John 6:60-69 from the Wordstrong schedule my church is reading for Lent. I love this passage of John, in fact the whole of John 6 is a wonderful glimpse into Jesus’ ministry and the reactions of the people to what He did and said. Chapter 6 is where Jesus feeds the 5,000, walks on water, and refers to Himself as the bread of life saying that anyone who seeks eternal life must eat His flesh and drink His blood. It is also, in the last section, where some of His disciples walk away because His teaching is too hard. John 6:60.
During the month of April, I am participating in the Blogging From A-Z April 2012 Challenge, where we post everyday except for Sundays. I have decided to make flashcards for the letter of the day out of my photos, and then use the picture as a writing prompt. I am using my Thesaurus to make a story out of words beginning with the letter "N", and to have it make sense. I have no idea of the twists and turns that it will take and usually crack myself up when I am all through. Hope these little ditties make you laugh too. The whole list of my A-Z posts are all listed on the top
The most important thing is to keep busy and to make sure there are not too many boring moments. It helps to sit behind the computer and to pretend I'm doing all sorts of interesting things. A lot of times I do, but sometimes I'm just sitting here day dreaming. As long as I keep my hand on the mouse it feels like I'm engaged in an activity.
But surely there's more to it than that? I'm tempted to say not really, but actually I do have a few tips and tricks too. Sticks are excellent, and for all that retractable walking poles have become overly technified, they do make a difference (though fallen branches are almost as good) - they also make excellent swords for young boys to fight with. Cyclists use body-warmers to ward off wind-chill and they're excellent for walking too - just make sure you find ones with pockets. On the subject of which most people don't have enough and use rucksacks that are far too small - the extra weight of a larger sack is minuscule but if it means you can carry your kid's waterproofs and stuff in a bigger picnic and flask, it makes all the difference to your day. Alpkit gourdon sacs are cheap, light and very cleverly designed - they're a great online retailer too.

After reaching the top of the tower we would nearly always spend the first several minutes silently taking in the view around us-- the shadowy majesty of the Great Smoky Mountains silhouetted against the night sky, a glimmering peek of Chilhowee Lake behind the foothills, the darkness of the valleys, and the expansive spread of the constellation of lights between us and Knoxville and beyond. We could see the lights of the Knoxville McGhee-Tyson Airport and watch the coming of going of the air traffic. There was the continous movement of the lights of the ground traffic flowing the streets below. The world of the night time spread out all about us as we watched in a sort of awestruck silence.
Of course, I've been concentrating on some of the crime fiction-related sessions, and authors - but I've been so impressed by everything at the festival. Something that will stay with me for a long time is the excitement and exuberance of the many kids who have been attending - meeting authors like Oliver Jeffers, Eoin Colfer, and Emily Rodda (pictured above with me, and her recent crime novel LOVE, HONOUR, AND O'BRIEN - written under her real name Jennifer Rowe - after her extremely popular session with Eoin Colfer on Friday evening). It's great to see so many young people really excited about books and reading. And some of the authors have definitely been treated like rock stars by their young fans. How awesome is that?
Sitting on a train always has me thinking the worst case scenario. I’m a survivor, or so I’d like to think, and I watch my world with a suspicious eye but would natural instinct go down the drain once a screaming MTA employee burst on the intercom telling its riders to vacate… only to have them walk into the real trouble without anyone knowing?

Decide to follow Jesus in every part of your life. Rather than limiting your faith only to the times you spend praying or worshiping in church, extend it to every aspect of your life – from your family life to your job. Seek Jesus’ guidance for everything that you say and do, and choose to follow His guidance.

A foreign doctor seemingly at the centre of the disturbances appears right on cue. They want him to explain what’s going on, he wants to explain what’s going on, they give him a microphone, and…they keep getting distracted. The speed of incoming fragments makes them feel urgent, even though they only give information we already know (something contagious is making people behave incomprehensibly), while the doctor is offering solid intel on how the affected act, and how to hide from them. But noise is news; noise gets priority.

Two Irish Lads is also scheduled to be released in e-book format in July. Amazon has quoted me a price of $350 – $375 to convert the ms to Kindle format. Why, I don`t know. It`s their exclusive format, and so it means more sales for them. However, Maple Creek Media has a price of $149 which includes a Nook formating as well. It also includes sumitting the finished product to both Amazon and Barnes & Noble. They also have a very good publishing offer, so you might be interested in checking them out.

There was a new handbag, since the last one literally fell to bits. Pretty much identical to the last 3 or more I've made because this design really meets my needs.

As an addendum to my past few posts, I've had several people comment to me over the past several weeks since I lost my previous job that I should've applied for food stamps after I lost my job, since I'd obviously paid into the system and was now in need. A few people I know only in online forums (primarily preparation/food storage-related sites) have said that while it's great that my family has enough food for several months, this might not be the ultimate "stuff hits the fan" scenario for me, so instead of depleting my deep pantry, they said, I should apply for all possible aid that I was eligible for, since I'd "earned" it.

With the Circuit getting under way following the various national championships, Monaco became the site of the first truly fast race of the year as Rudisha (following a win at Kenyan Nationals) would blaze a new WL of 1:42.61, leading Kiprop (1:43.15), Symmonds (1:43.83) and Mutua (1:43.99) under 1:44 – and signaling that Rudisha was over his earlier physical issues. London would provide the final hot race of the year before the World Championships as Rudisha and Kaki would go head to head for the first time in 2011 – with Kaki also coming off a huge run in Monaco having run a 1500 PR of 3:31.76. Kaki stayed close but could not overcome the long striding Kenyan as Rudisha won yet again 1:42.91 to 1:43.13. And so it was that they would head to Daegu.

The colonoscopy. Your doctors will call the colonoscopy “routine”. However, you will call it “obscene”. Around a certain age, everyone is supposed to get one. What they won’t tell you is that the procedure involves sticking a length of garden hose up your ass and then filling you with more air then a Thanksgiving Day parade float. They do not tell you about the hose until you are about to go under. Once you see it, you may, as your mom did – frantically try to negotiate the length of hose to go up your derriere. This is futile as you will be passed out and unable to gauge whether your doctor is a man of his word or not. The garden hose will take pictures of your yellow brick road and god willing, it will be pristine. You will leave this procedure feeling both violated and bloated.
It is true that Mr. Truc Ho did not meet the president on his visit to Washington, but the fact remains that he was invited to the White House. Because of his hard work and genuine dedication, Mr. Truc Ho had captured the attention of the White House. Besides human rights, there is a very prevalent reason that Truc Ho was invited to Washington. By rallying nearly 150,000 signatures to his petition, Truc Ho has shown that there is a strong group of potential voters out there. If there is one thing that a politician loves, it’s the vote.

Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel: So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand. He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.

Before I end this post, I like to sincerely thank everyone who left me with kind words at my previous posts.

FT.com reported on January 25, 2005 that "The World Health Organisation yesterday agreed a compromise resolution designed to allow countries to override patents in efforts to tackle a future flu pandemic while limiting the risk to intellectual property rights." This news follows from an earlier report from the SFGate.com that "A session of the 32-nation WHO executive board was bogged down on the issue of whether countries hit by an epidemic could override patents on anti-flu drugs, and the meeting was halted to let delegates call their governments for guidance."
So often, I find within myself a deep sense of sadness. I have no reason for sadness, but it’s there none the less. I can step back and look at the facts of my life–the fact that I have a happy marriage, a good job, a cozy home, loving friends and family, the hope of God–so much to be thankful for and to look forward to. And yet, even among the facts of my happy life, I find sadness. Unreasonable, inexplicable sadness. I have always felt this sadness something I need to change, to overcome; I have viewed it as a weakness and a flaw…until recently. I have lately started to wonder if this sadness actually has anything good to offer–if it is perhaps a good and important part of my nature rather than a part that need be weeded out.

I do know we're not even close to Halloween, but I was in the mood to play today. It's been an unispiring summer so I had to dig through a number of folders before I found something to "do."

After about two weeks of hearing this, I thought, “Maybe I do need to read the Bible.” So, I put in a request for a Bible and then returned to wallowing in my sorrow. By this time I considered myself pond scum – that’s what I thought I was. I had given up all hope of ever seeing my family again. I saw no hope of ever getting out of jail. I assumed I would spend the rest of my life there, and I felt I deserved to be there.

I wish I didn’t get so caught up in moments. I act on instinct. I don’t always think before I speak. I never used to be like this, everything used to feel so much more light-hearted and relaxed, I used to be the one cheering people up, making the most of a bad time, looking on the bright side. It feels like it’s just me, but I’m not sure it is, I think it’s a lot of people. I want to run far, far away from this place again and start a fresh. Maybe its just today. I just want everything to be OK.
Trust me it does not go to the very top…

Juliette hasn't touched anyone in exactly 264 days. The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal. As long as she doesn't hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don't fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.

I'm fine with people making mistakes (I've made my fair share of them over the years) and actually appreciate when someone can be open and honest about it. It's a breath of fresh air to hear someone say "I'm sorry...I made a mistake". It shows me that you are responsible enough to admit and take ownership of the error.
Atri found my blog, learned that I love interior design and we had a photo shoot of my house back in May this year. I was on cloud nine as you can imagine. This time, I worked with Atri to be a stylist for the photo shoot at KOI Kemang. I love the sound of it. Stylist. I’m not even close to be able to call myself as “stylist”, but I enjoyed the every moment of the styling experience working with Atri.

Whereas the first two books I encountered focus too much on technical aspects of poetry, Heaney tends to assume these things are in place, and moves on to demonstrate that there must be something beyond technique, and through exploring a poem as apparently simple as John Clare’s ‘The Thunder Mutters’ Heaney shows that sometimes a poet’s skill is doing more with less and making it look easy.

I don’t want my childhood to just be memories of the sexual abuse I suffered. I don’t want my only memories to be of him, my grandfather, S, and the other men. If I could have just one perfect memory of a moment without fear and pain, I would at least have something to think of fondly. But so far I’m just drawing a blank. Maybe my wishes for that memory is just a fool’s errand. Maybe I’m adding injury to my already painful past by wishing for something that I for some reason am unable to access.
Yet according to contemporary Muslim observer Muqtedar Khan, commenting on the several mosques in Oxford, England, and the Oxford Center for Islamic Studies, “Gibbon would have been surprised to learn the lesson that military defeats do not stop the advance of civilizations and the globalization of Islam is unimpeded by the material and military weaknesses of the Muslim world.”
Written in lines of 5 -7 – 5 – 7 – 7 syllabic poems expressing feelings . and emotions were dispatched by servants in a variety of mediums: paper containers, on flaps of folding fans, knotted on stems of blossoms in a myriad of fashions limited only by coy boundaries of writers imagination.
What follows is a powerful and clever drama that should have merited a UK cinema release, just when you think you know what’s going to happen it veers off in another direction whilst always maintaining its credibility.

I bought the bulb quickly and asked one of the guys if he could help me stick it in because everything that’s behind the hood of a car confuses me. Plus, I wanted a “cover”, so I could gawk at him a little more. The nice man behind the counter walked me outside and got busy under the hood. I looked out over his bent back towards the tent.

He realized that he was facing the type of problem he never permitted at Apple. His treatment was fragmented rather than integrated. Each of his myriad maladies was being treated by different specialists—oncologists, pain specialists, nutritionists, and hematologists—but they were not being coordinated in a cohesive approach.

It just seemed the summer holidays were here for ever, something the kids dream about. But this week the schools went back in Brasov.

Holy hell - it's non-stop. I sleep with a bottle of Tums beside the bed and there is a roll in my purse at all times. Considering all my organs are squished up, it doesn't surprise me but it's KILLER. It doesn't help that all I crave is spicy food...
The last move occurred when Frid, now the series’ superstar, demanded that he didn’t want to play Barnabas any more, and thus was indulged with a Wuthering Heights-ish plotline in which he became “Bramwell Collins.” The show unfortunately was cancelled during that flashback — with only a TV Guide article by one of the scripters (Sam Hall, married to the show’s “Dr. Julia Hoffman,” Grayson Hall) to explain where it would’ve gone after that.
Thanks for visiting my blog today. Keep well.
I think that I feel the need to see if something I had all those years ago is still there. Am I capable, was I capable, have I had it and lost it? Have I been wasting my time a bit over the years not getting on with it. If I’m honest, yes I have. There have been some valid excuses over the years, and some which were just excuses. A bit of growing up, and a bit of laziness perhaps? Yes, I would imagine so. Does this mean I lack the drive? Some writers have to write everyday, that is part of who they are. I don’t have that, or have not had that for a while. I used to I think, it seems a bit like a distant memory now, a little like I’m imagining it. In my mind, and somewhat written / typed out, I have plenty of projects that I can work on, in various stages of development. They were not progressing very well, or, as is really the case, just not very quickly.
This one was a wild order as I pointed at the Spanish sign and tried to converse with the person behind the meat counter. The result was me choosing beef and pork and four small rolls/burgers appearing on my plate. In essence, it was just a mini grilled snack with well cooked meat in a plain mini bun.
Last, we have a few changes here at Tiddly Inks:
Banks, for instance, have tools to help one crystallise individual, family and business needs and to map out quality financial solutions in line with one’s needs. The affluent value this approach. Our research shows that the average Asian affluent wants:

There are two Adhans for Friday Prayer. The first Athan is recited when the sun begins to decline and the second is recited just before the Imam stands up before the congregation to deliver his sermon.
Both of these sides of the coin – the ineffectiveness of our ‘correctional institutions’ and corruption in the juridical process combine to ensure there are more victims. Not just from people who offend a second time, but also people who cannot, or do not dare to seek help before they commit a crime. How can you ask for help when the system will simply mark you as dangerous and then systematically take your life apart?
AN OPEN LETTER TO SLAYER FANS AROUND THE WORLD:
The bells on his truck had a very distinctive ring too. They jingled like those on Santa’s sleigh. Full of music, full of life. Nothing at all like the cheap sound of the Good Humor man. No, Morris’s bells were probably made of sterling silver instead of tin.
Clarifying his original ruling that the plaintiffs did not have a fundamental right to possess, use, and enjoy their property, Judge Fiedler explained clearly that there are no fundamental rights to own and use a dairy cow or dairy herd, to consume the milk from one’s own cows, to board one’s cow at a farm, or to consume the food of one’s choice. In addition, Judge Fielder stated that the private contract between the Zinnikers and NbN falls within the scope of the State’s police power, that the government has the power to regulate the private conduct of growing and consuming food.
How many of you have wood decks? Oh, how i wish i could raise my hand as well. I just have grass. My table and chairs...just sittin' on some grass. Flower pots...plopped on the lawn. If i did one day get my low platform deck that i'm pining away for, i'd love it to be along these lines.
We loved the brand that we originally bought, but after a while, they just didn't seem to fit the way we had hoped.
However, I would like to concentrate on the news coverage following the discovery of Amar's body, particularly on the 24 hour rolling news broadcasts given by BBC News24 and Sky News, because it was very enlightening.

I repeated the seasoning process again and plan to do it once more before I use the pan for baking (especially if I can get my hands on some lard). After that, it's just hot water and a soft rag for this pan to preserve the seasoning. I'm hoping that's the end of the rust, but it if comes back, I'll have to repeat the whole scrubbing-seasoning process again! This slightly-gray pan should turn a classic cast-iron black with increased usage - guess I'd better get started on my Easter baking!

I hope you all enjoy this day & take time to relax & spend time with your loved ones. Today I have a guest, Oksana from Order Matters. She is going to challenge us to get organized!

“Do remember how mad you were when nobody asked you to go to the prom? What you didn’t know was I told everyone not to. I knew if anyone else asked you, you wouldn’t go with me. I couldn’t ask you, though. Back then you never took me seriously….actually I’m not sure you ever did, but especially not back then. You would have laughed at me and shot me down without even considering it. So, I made sure you had no other options. Mike Ruggers almost get a black a black eye over you but eventually he saw things my way, too. Maybe that wasn’t fair to you and I’m sure you’re probably pretty mad at me. I’m not going to lie though and say I’m sorry. Going to that prom with you was the best thing I’ve ever done.”
How it affects us… I have no clue yet, but am soooo incredibly excited to find out!! Maybe todays meditation will give birth to tomorrows understanding within this timeline.

“‘The Lover’s Dictionary’ is clever and poetic and, sigh, sad. . . The brief entries are like poetry; poetry with a gravitational pull back to the central narrative, which is two people falling in love. The fact that the pieces hold together so well is testament, not only to Levithan’s light hand and gracious writing but also to the power of this universal story.”
If you are interested mainly in running, here are a couple posts I’m really proud of.
I write the emails I send to well-known people and organisations, imagining very different reception scenarios. In the case of the Jim Beam email, for instance, I imagined a chimpanzee being slightly surprised by the noise of the email chime, making a little noise of distress, then (inexpertly) pressing the delete button with his long index finger, just like he’d been taught to.

In years that have three Friday the 13ths, we also have three Saturday the 14ths, three Sunday the 15ths, three Monday the 16ths, etc. Those years also have three Friday the 6ths, three Friday the 20ths, and three Friday the 27ths. However, nobody is concerned by the equivalent occurrence of all these dates.

She’s a sharp cookie and has also written a book by the same name (“Free Range Kids,” not “Sharp Cookie”).

The latest story in the Fighting for Gwen fundraising effort and subscriber incentive story series has been revealed! By donating to Gwen’s cause, you can set up yourself as a subscriber to this series, featuring stories written by an impressive list of authors (oh, and me), who’ve donated a story to this cause. From what I’ve been told, response so far to this initiative has been very positive, but they can always use a bit more help.
Take it from me, composing content material isn’t generally easy. You’ll find quite a few significant elements that have to be included in any good post and it might be very simple to make some incredibly fundamental blunders which can turn an excellent piece of content, which folks will wish to share, into anything which individuals will overlook and forget. You will actually benefit in case you stay away from making these blunders:

When I went on my shopping spree, I found only the Rochefort 8, the medial beer in the range. This puts Rochefort in a slight disadvantage, because with Chimay and Westmalle, I found the largest in their respective ranges. Rochefort 10 (which I've enjoyed in the past) is richer and creamier and hotter with alcohol, but not a radical departure, so I think my tasting of the 8 will suffice.

What better than a padded fabric covered cork board??? It was pretty simple to make. I had purchased this fabric at Hancock Fabrics for $4 a yard. I bought four yards because I wanted to make curtains for my office as well.

Proskurowski and study co-author Tobias Kukulka, University of Delaware, said that data collected from just the surface of the water commonly underestimates the total amount of plastic in the water by an average factor of 2.5. In high winds, the volume of plastic could be underestimated by a factor of 27.

Anyways, just in case you're worried that I'm bored with my new life, I'm here to tell you that I'm not. Yesterday, I lollygagged in my jammies until around 3PM, at which point I decided I couldn't live with the dust bunnies accumulating in the corners of my home for one more minute. For the time being, they've been banished. Today I'm knitting this beautiful shawl and reveling in the feel of the merino/bamboo blend yarn as it slips through my fingers. I was concerned that it would fall by the wayside when John Sandford's new book was released today, but I have found that it is possible to sit on the front porch with my iPad propped just so while reading Stolen Prey and simultaneously knitting a garter stitch project which needs barely any attention at all.
Okay, that’s it for now. I might look at other parts of Buchanan’s book on another occasion.

It wasn’t until I’d emigrated and we were living in the house we bought that I truly had a chance to get back under the stars. We moved into that house in late August, 2005 – our first day was actually the day after our first anniversary and the summer stars were still visible. I started to use the telescope almost immediately and within days (or more precisely, nights) I was finding some of the things I had always wished I could see. The Lagoon Nebula was one of the first. I also saw Uranus for the first time too, closely followed by Neptune – the last time I’d seen that distant blue world was twenty years previously with the Luton Astronomical Society.
I have deliberately avoided mention of the death-penalty for fear of stirring up heated emotions. The only time I ever debated the issue was when I was a young circus ape. We performers had been invited to tea at the home of Reginald Bullshot, a retired army colonel who had invested in the circus. I happened to mention that some appalling serial killer ought to be fed to the lions.

In the other seat sits Radhanath Swami, looking rather otherworldly with his shaved head and shining orange robes. Years ago, he was Richard Slavin, a Jewish kid from suburban Illinois, until in 1970 at the age of nineteen he left his normal life and hitch-hiked to India, where he soon found himself meditating in the Himalayas. After many years searching as a wandering monk, he found his guru in ISKCON founder Srila Prabhupada. And today he remains a Swami, serving the Lord in the renounced order of life, and leading the spiritual community of Radha Gopinath Ashram in Chowpatty, Mumbai.
You'd best beware Moogie the Magical, thieving scum, or I'll transform you into the literal slime that you are and deliver you up to Obama's algae-based energy experiments! At least there you'll be among your own kind, and potentially productive, instead of just another leeching wart on the nose of society.
By one who is skilled in goodness,
Aries, like these rams, is quite competitive. This is taken to the logical conclusion with Ares/Mars, god of war; war being, of course, an extremely large-scale and deadly competition. Aries energy, if out of balance, becomes dependent on external validation–whether that is mates, accolades, trophies, or others’ fear. Like fire, the element that rules this sign, Aries can be creative or destructive, and when it is destructive, it is the berserker of the Zodiac.

It doesn’t do any good to lie or cover up America’s uglier side, but refocusing our education at the expense of what makes the United States exceptional in the history of the world has cultural consequences. We’d be remiss not to reexamine how we teach our own history. This time, let’s leave Zinn’s victim politics out of it.

There are still enclaves in America that lack peace -- the inner city where gangs rule, for example -- but the vast majority of citizens can live the vast majority of their lives in peace. A yeoman in fourteenth-century England would have been on his knees thanking God in unabashed amazement had he the opportunity to experience the peace which is our routine and unearned condition.

Quite by chance, I read a version of Sister Carrie that was fairly different from the one I read in high school. When Dreiser published this in 1900, several people made cuts for different reasons: a friend of his cut a lot of the Naturalist philosophizing in the interest of selling it to a wider audience; his wife made editorial changes for readability; his editor cut out some of the more scandalous bits. The version I read is a “restored” version published by Penguin Classics, with an introduction by Alfred Kazin, and it brings back all the lost material. I found it more tragic, more shocking, and far more interesting than I’d remembered — though of course most of that is me, as a reader, getting better over the years, not Dreiser.
