Oak casks can add considerable complexity to wine, but when it goes over the top, we may feel like we're chewing on a tree branch instead of drinking a grape. This is where the choice of what kind of oak casks - new or old? French or American? - greatly affects the quality and cost of the final product. Casks are not cheap and have a limited lifespan. Winemakers will often put part of their grapes into new barrels and part into old barrels to modulate the amount of oak flavoring they want to achieve.

The irony of Kodak's decline, however, lies in the fact that the company's own researchers had invented the first digital camera way back in 1976. That should have put Kodak in a position to dominate the industry with a stream of new products — cameras, printers, printer papers and inks — just as it had in the old days. But that never happened, mostly because the company's leaders simply couldn't imagine a world in which pictures weren't shot on film. The unraveling of the house of Eastman came about not because the company didn't have the technology to compete in the new era that was unfolding but because it lacked the vision to use it.

Veteran center Matt Birk said last week that he was still mulling a decision on whether to retire or return for another season. Birk has also said since the season ended that if he returns, it will be with the Ravens. I’m sure Birk is weighing numerous factors, but this week could add some clarity to his decision. Birk’s agent is Joe Linta, who will meet with team officials at the combine to begin discussions about a contract extension for another one of his clients, quarterback Joe Flacco. I’m going to assume that Birk comes up at some point in the conversation. Birk had a tough go of it in the two playoff games, but otherwise he had another solid season. However, I don’t believe it is a foregone conclusion that the Ravens bring him back even if Birk decides that he’d prefer to push back retirement another year. General Manager Ozzie Newsome’s comment at the State of the Ravens address that the team will add another center to the roster for next season only reinforces the idea that team officials would like to get a little younger and more physical on the offensive line.

When I moved to Oregon in November 1991 from Chicago, two years after graduating from college, I figured it would be a nice change. Pacific Northwest rain didn't particularly concern me. Nor was I concerned the area had so few African Americans. Besides, Midwest winters are brutal and rough on cars. I never thought about weather-related car damage in Oregon like I had in Illinois. I also never thought driving my car would cause me to be in frequent contact with the police.

But perhaps it isa good thing to some extent. Because startlingly absent - or not so startlingly, if you've followed our judicial elections over the years - on this very early list is anyone from the civil or criminal-defense bars. That is because it is very hard to beat someone with "deputy district attorney" as their ballot designation in conservative, law-and-order Orange County. The necessary diversity of the bench, therefore, must rely on the gubernatorial appointment process, which is political, yes, but also involves stringent vetting by a bipartisan commission of lawyers.

Last year's vintage included mustards, relishes, apples, peaches, applesauce and salsa.
"We have 99.9 percent compliance, and we have great feedback from our hotels and our restaurants and our businesses," Goldstein said. "Pretty much everybody is happy. But there's always that 0.1 percent that could misunderstand the intent of the ordinance, so we'll go back and look at the language."
Yet Bastoni's bahn mi ($12) is also among the best I've had, the ciabatta loaded with a half dozen meatballs that manage to be both fluffy yet dense with flavor beneath their lightly browned crust. There's crunch in the shredded carrot, pickled bean sprouts and cilantro, and heat in the glistening swath of sriracha, and the whole thing is bundled in brown paper held tight with a rubber band.
Jonathan Winters, who worked with Henry on the 1976 special "Jonathan Winters Presents 200 Years of American Humor" and other shows, said Henry was good with comedy "because he would pretty much let you gamble with your material. He would let you do your thing."
I spoke with several travelers who are planning to visit Europe this summer, and for the most part they seem unfazed. John Rybczyk and his wife, Barbara, who are on their way to Hungary in early July, aren't worried about the exchange rate. Hungary, which doesn't use the euro as its currency, is still a deal compared with other European countries. Plus, it's politically stable. "I'm not concerned," he told me.

Wallace spent a season with the Blazers, helping them get into last season's playoffs, then was traded earlier this month at the deadline to New Jersey. It's hard to believed an 11th-year veteran can be happy on a team with the fourth-worst record in the league and a seemingly dim immediate outlook. In six games with the Nets, Wallace has been a part of one win.

Activists said a family that had fled from nearby Duma was killed in the building, and they blamed Assad's forces. A pro-regime TV station was on the scene in less than 15 minutes to film the wreckage, according to the Revolutionary Council in the Damascus Suburbs, an observation often made by opposition activists to suggest that the quick response indicates the explosion was the work of the government.

Next up were RIM and HP. I won't claim that the PlayBook and the Touchpad struck out. That'd be too charitable. Those two companies tried to bunt their way onto base by sticking their faces into the strike zone. And when the Apple fastball knocked them unconscious, they fell on top of the ball, thus tagging themselves out. It really wasn't pretty. Hysterically funny, yes . . . but not pretty.

Dr. Khrishnansu Tewari, a gynecologic oncologist at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center and associate professor at University of California Irvine, said the study's findings are in some ways reassuring, in that invasive ovarian cancer rates did not, on average, go up for women who underwent IVF. He added that borderline ovarian tumors are highly treatable. And he said that the Dutch study is not more revealing than the 2009 study which came to an opposite conclusion. "I don't think readers should make too much of this," Tewari said.

Obama has pushed tough sanctions on Iran. His hard-edged diplomacy has gotten Europeans to line up with him to demand that Iran refrain from building nukes. The president, showing his grimmest face, insists he is not bluffing when he says that military action is a real and ready option if Iran does not comply with the demands of the international community (at least the international community that does not include Russia and China, which, for obvious self-interested reasons, do not approve of military intervention in countries where the governments are corrupt and authoritarian).

Like all of us, people with "pre-diabetes" need to also pay particular attention to their intake over the holidays. Pre-diabetes is the state that occurs when a person's blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes. In other words, it is the very early stages of diabetes. Most people with "pre-diabetes" have an opportunity to slow their progression to diabetes by eating well, exercising and losing 5 percent of their body weight. Though it may not be realistic to lose weight during the holidays, certainly focusing on making healthy choices, cutting portion sizes and getting plenty of exercise can be steps in the right direction.

Things start out slowly (this really was a slow burn of an episode, ultimately fulfilling but still), Megan's mom is full of life and flirty with Don ("She touched you six times in an hour," Megan later notes, which Don simply dismisses as her being very French). Megan's dad is uber-professorial and does not enjoy the pair's home ("It's exquisitely decadent," dad says) or Don's profession ("He's a Communist or a Socialist or a Maoist or something that makes him hate me for what I do," Don tells Roger, apparently blind to the fact that hardcore advertising folks may turn people off).

He's repeatedly called for a more regional approach to schooling -- an idea central to the summer academy for rising ninth-graders from anywhere in Cuyahoga County that he started last year. He's talked about the need to see all schools -- public, charter, private and parochial -- as part of a single system.

A: It's definitely, umm ... some of the reactions are a bit different than what I expected, but I mean, look, you never know when you do something like this. I just made a conscious decision like I've probably got one shot at this and you're faced with a very important choice whether you tell everything in an unvarnished warts and all way or you make something more of a ... you sugarcoat things. I just decided this is my one shot, I'm going to tell it like it happened and we're going to do our best to nail down every little detail. So far no one's gone on record contradicting anything in the book but if they do and they're right, then certainly in the next edition ... I'm a stickler for detail and correctness and we would correct anything that wasn't accurate.

Regardless of the results, it seems to make sense for the Yankees to see what they could have in Nunez as an outfielder. It could get ugly at times, but with the infield stacked with what he called “heavy names,” there's no harm in seeing how Nunez fits away from the infield. At the very least, it could open a door for him down the line, especially since the Yankees appear to be so in love with what he brings to the table.

Unknown, however, to the millions of fans and alumni the integrity (read morality) part slipped away during the past nine years as Mr. Paterno turned a blind eye toward the allegations of sexual abuse of young boys by his assistant coach, Jerry Sandusky. He avoided taking responsibility for reporting Mr. Sandusky to the police after he was informed about the alleged rape of a 10-year-old boy by Mr. Sandusky and, instead, passed the buck to his athletic director, Tim Curley, after which the issue apparently disappeared from Happy Valley, thus keeping everyone, well, happy!

Some may question his lack of experience as a head coach, but none will question his desire and motives for the Rutgers Football program. One area Flood can be judged by was the success and failures of his offensive line units. There were highs and lows. The 2006 unit allowed a mere 8 sacks, good enough to lead the nation. The 2010 unit allowed 61 sacks, worst in the nation. The running game faced similar peaks and valleys, though of course, former Rutgers start Ray Rice may have had something to do with that. In 2011, the team reversed course and finished around the middle of the pack in the country in sacks, and while the running game did struggle at times, it did close out strong in two of the last three games of the season.

I really encourage my cooks to think about those things - why we use different wines and vinegars in building flavors."

I also think that the TSA has been spending too much time around airlines, which generally prefer imposing punitive fees to offering incentives.

To typical Israelis, theirs is a country of 6 million Jews faced with the ardent, sometimes fanatic, hostility of 350 million neighboring Arabs (to say nothing of another billion or so non-Arab Muslims) and the contested loyalty of one million of its own Arab citizens.

Iran has now enriched more than 5,000 kilograms of uranium.
