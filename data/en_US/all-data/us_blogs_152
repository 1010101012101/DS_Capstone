Boehm reviewed dozens of studies examining a positive outlook – as determined by various psychological measurements – on heart health. Optimism in particular seems key, as a number of studies found the most optimistic people had half the risk of a first heart attack when compared to the least optimistic, Boehm said.

In addition, Carter states that the major problem for the sectarian-synagogal reading is that there is little historical evidence outside the Gospel to support it. He examines the historical context—primarily that of Ephesus—to provide a plausible scenario for the use of the gospel and asserts that “John’s rhetoric of distance seeks in part to disturb the Jesus-believers’ general sense of at-homeness in late first-century Ephesus and impose greater distance.”[3]

Despite the fact that the brothers were black and all their victims white and in the face of the obvious hatred involved in their crime, the authorities laughably (should that be contemptibly?) declared that “race played no part” in the crime and the brothers did not face hate crimes charges. This was of course a charade, they could not have been charged with a hate crime because of the skin colour of their victims.
This post marks my last day of professional experience but to be honest, my experience still continues. Even though I had to do professional experience as part of my module, I plan to continue looking for more because it is a really good insight into the industry.

Sassoon died on 9 May 2012 at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles. Though his death was originally reported to be a result of natural causes, it was later reported to have been a result of his leukaemia. He died in the presence of his family and Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Kevin Maiberger said that when the police went to his residence at Mulholland Drive at 10:30 he was found to have died. A memorial service was planned for a later date.
Yes, Bond and Hubert share the same pedigree in many ways but they are different animals. Hubert has a Gallic joie de vivre that no British actor could ever hope to duplicate.

Basically, when such an outlier of a giant in a sport exists in an area there's hardly any reason to keep records on such things--everyone already knows who the King Bee is.

So, for the next two weeks we are to give him only one dose a day (as opposed to the two he's been getting). After that, if he's not retaining fluid or working too hard to breathe, we can stop them all together. Then, after that, we are to work on weaning him to the point of being off oxygen all waking hours. Now, we won't know for a while if he'll be able to handle all this or how long it will take, but at least the doctors think we are to that point. Once he's off all waking hours, we are to let them know so that they can set up a sleep study and see how he does at night. I'm not sure what all that involves but I believe it will just mean a machine that will track him as he sleeps. Once he passes that test, we are done with oxygen! I cannot wait!

Becker, a retired US Army Airborne Ranger, had his legs and most fingers blown off by an Iraqi suicide bomber. He used his over-five years rehabilitation to become fluent in Urdu and Pashto and understands Arabic. Becker is currently connected to the Special Activities Division of the CIA. His “special activities” include leaving his fancy prostheses in a locker in Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. It means living outside that compound in a cardboard shelter and practicing getting around on a padded furniture dolly built from materials scrounged in Pakistan for weeks, eating the diet of a poor Pakistani, bathing only occasionally, and reciting passionately the prayers of the Salafist Jihadi until he can pass himself off as a beggar in Abbottabad, Pakistan.

Most of us have jobs where we put in a lot of hours. We have responsibilities with our family and homes. We have some free time to relax and participate in hobbies and recreational activities. In all of these endeavors, we continue to represent Christ. Our Christian witness is not restricted to the church, or working with specific evangelism efforts. Our whole life is a witness. Are we seeking to let the light of Christ shine through our lives?
I might sound pompous but that's probably because he's one of my favorite players so I tend to get very subjective about him. In any case the compilation that I'm sharing is (as the title suggests) a bunch of songs he recorded in his "late"career. At those times ragtime (or hot jazz) was starting to settle down for a more orchestrated and organized way of playing - swing so what you get here is an interesting middle ground between the two types of jazz. Musically speaking this means that songs are much more relaxed, they swing but they still have some great improvised solos which makes this record so great. You'll notice a lot things that are way ahead of their times, especially the sax solos which often hint to the bebop way of playing. They are all instrumentals so we can fully enjoy the wondrous playing of a person that just had so little luck. So sit back and enjoy the swing.
Holocaust denial is a major industry today, and much of it is enthusiastically received ( and bankrolled) from the Islamic world, not only in the Middle East but at hundreds of mosques and madrassahs in the West, to the point where in Britain and elsewhere, educators avoid teaching about it so as not to make any waves or contradict what many Muslim youngsters are being taught at home or as part of their religious studies.

But the OKC fans are just loud. And proud. No other way to describe it. Some say the shirts they wear are somewhat premature (which I suppose they are) but that’s what makes being a fan so fun. You want your team to succeed. You believe, no matter what to any end, they will win. Being a self-proclaimed and at times published sports writer I’ve spent years continually studying teams, making predictions, looking at all possible outcomes, but sometimes all you want to say is, “I believe that we will win.”

Even how you reacted, perceived it, or perhaps, made it mean something about you, is your choosing.
The Turkish Premier was predictably vague about how it will all work. Eschewing any detail about how a presidential system in Turkey would function, Erdogan said that if forthcoming elections suggested a mandate to slim down the republic’s existing constitution, he would go ahead.

Ok, so maybe life-and-death scenarios do exist, but most of the time, making mistakes won’t mean the end of the world. Of course, there will be a time when you’re not supposed to screw up, but this doesn’t apply to all parts of your life. Expect to make a handful of mistakes along the way. Only through hands-on experience will you learn the right way to do things. You might think you have it all figured out – especially when you’re just getting started – but doing it in the real world will reveal unforeseen factors which you didn’t take into account. This is why trial and error is an essential part of the learning process. Remember, it’s not about the mistakes you make, but rather how you make use of the lessons you’ve learned from them. However, don’t think this is an excuse to be mediocre because the point is to always give it your best shot. If you miss the mark, take notes and do it again.

Last week, I talked about my search for more square footage in a small space (for my books). This hidden passage doorway is genius! What would be a waste of space, could be utilized to be purposeful and decorative at the same time. Right? I mean, you couldn't use the water heater space to store anything, right? My only question would be if the shelves would actually be able to withstand the weight of books. Wouldn't want it to fall off the hinges.
For a detailed study, I would suggest the Anchor Bible (AB) by John Reumann, NICNT by Gordon Fee, or NIGTC by Peter O’Brien. For an intermediate study, try Word (WBC) by Gerald Hawthrone, or Baker (BECNT) by Moises Silva. If you have time to read and sift through all the details, then that’s fine.

It was a no brainer, extremely popular and easy! How could I not make it?!?

Plant work and manufacturers created 120,000 jobs in the first three months of the year. Ford Motor is doing their part; the car company added 5,500 jobs this year that were previously outsourced.

But automakers aren’t the only ones bringing jobs back to the states; mega corporations and small private companies alike are reclaiming jobs.

On the non-knitting front, we had an unprecedented and totally unexpected visit from a pair of King Parrots a couple of weeks ago. DH was having a cuppa out on the back deck and quietly called me out to see these beautys. We kept our movements slow and quiet, and they didn’t seem at all fazed by us. At first glance, I thought they were Crimson Rosellas, but DH, the birdo of the family, assured me they were King Parrots. Coincidentally, B had just learnt about them at school, and wondered if this was a sign to make them her project subject. Up to then, I’d never seen a King Parrot either in captivity or in the wild. Quite a treat!

I, along with millions of others around the world, have come to realise the importance of the world’s environment, especially in the context of our health and economic well-being. Many have taken small steps to help in reversing the many results of all of us ignoring the consequences of our way of life. But, we need a new way of thinking in terms of taking action, as part of our journey together. One way of bringing this change about is to encourage you, as ‘guardians’ of our financial capital, to only invest in businesses which meet certain criteria with regard to the environment. I would suggest that these criteria are used as a basis for deciding whether to invest or make loans to businesses:

Pascal ran in after her and asked “Are you ok? Did Billy try anything with you?” Casey stopped the flow of tears and cracked a smile and said “Don’t be silly, Pac. Billy wouldn’t do that. I think you should leave now.” Puzzled about Casey behavior Pascal left and couldn’t shake the feeling that Casey wasn’t ok, and that she was lying. There was nothing he could do, since he didn’t know the truth. And he knew Casey well enough that when she told him something she never changed her story. Casey didn’t filed charges against the boys because of the public humiliation and harassment that accompany rape allegations. People treat rape victims like they asked for the violent behavior. That wasn’t anything anybody should ever have to go through. She, like thousands of other young women, had been through enough. So she suffered in silence.

Never one to sit around knowing she could help her community, Georgia formed a non-profit food pantry and future youth development program on the Cheyenne River Reservation last year, Okiciyap (we help) the Isabel Community. Again, with the help of bloggers, who were inspired by her fierce dedication to her community, we raised enough money to get a trailer that the Tribe had donated into place, skirt it, build a wheelchair ramp, and get a couple of deliveries of food to distribute. Over 100 families were helped within the past couple of months. That is Georgia's legacy to her community.

"I've noticed that everybody that is for abortion has already been born." ~Ronald Reagan
I come now to another idea that I’ve written on briefly before, which is the idea that syncretism is comparable to process theology, and which I’ve returned to briefly more recently as well when discussing the emergence of new deities. To just re-cap this issue briefly, process theology is the notion outlined by Alfred North Whitehead that the monotheistic deity isn’t perfect and all-knowing, and finds out more about itself as humanity likewise proceeds in history and finds out more about itself. My suggestion has been that syncretism in various religious cultures is a reflection of process theology in a polytheistic context. Deities develop over time and evolve as people get to know them more, and as they adapt to wider and wider cultural contacts and influences. It is a dual process, in other words: humans get to know more about the deities and thus their perceptions of the deities expand, while likewise deities see what is going on in history (and, occasionally, are involved in its developments directly!) and adapt themselves to the newer circumstances and cultural realities of humans in them as they do so. A few years ago at PantheaCon, Orion Foxwood said on a panel words to the effect of, “If you think that we’re the only ones having conventions to discuss these matters, you’re wrong–the deities are doing it as well!” This co-evolution of humans and deities together is a highly appealing notion, and one that I think a lot of modern polytheists, particularly those who are heavily involved in direct contact with and devotion to any number of deities, can understand on an instinctual level. Syncretism is a part of process theology, I think.
The first part of the article in the RecorD (mHeath in Action) talks about prenatal and neonatal care. From my understanding it is more of a triage or checkup function. I was actually surprised, though I know not why, at the percentages of the population that have cell or mobile coverage. Now I live out in the country and though we have cell phones they don’t always have coverage. So am I in that 80% regardless of the fact that when I am at home it only works 25% of the time??? And how reliable is that in the scheme of utilizing this technology as an emergency facilitator or an information source? Now one take on it has this technology being used in the facilities that lack technology typically found at health care providing facilities. So the triage and communication functions themselves are more feasible to me in this situation. A rural or third world clinic might not have sophisticated diagnostic equipment for a woman going into labor 2 months early but they may be able to call someone on that cell phone. Additionally, in those areas where care is primarily provided in the home rather than a clinic – at least the first level of care – then this makes sense as the communication tool.

This new content policy is the essence of censorship. While the examples of spam and identity theft constitute harm to others, “self-harm” blogs do not. Thus, when Tumblr eliminates this speech, Tumblr violates the very principles of free speech itself. Tumblr has pointed a finger at certain types of speech and has said “these things are unacceptable to us — they are banned.” That, Tumblr, does not constitute a deep commitment to freedom of speech.

For anyone not familiar, Provex City is my first novel, young adult fantasy, which I released only about a month ago in ebook format on Amazon. It is the first book in The Lorne Family Vault Series and a project I had been working on for almost three years. It was a hard decision to one day stop querying agents and commit to self-publishing. I was tired of waiting and wanted to continue telling my story. Now, I'm about 80% into my first draft of Book 2, writing before work and on my lunch breaks. My goal is to have it out by this fall.

The Bible everywhere speaks its praises of humility.
They are some of the most amazing, dedicated, talented, and wonderful people I have ever met in my life. I learn way more from them each year then what I teach in return. Through out the rehearsal process we discuss what the actor’s want to accomplish. This ranges from having fun, to learning new things, to hone their talents. And to show that we can do it to.

I looked into it a bit, and found out how to check my rank.
Vincenzo Peruggia it was, an Italian employee at the Louvre, who was finally discovered to be the Mona Lisa’s thief—more than two years after the lady’s disappearance. On that fateful Sunday night, Vincenzo completed his shift and hid in a room inside the museum. At some point in the early hours of Monday, he snuck out, walked up to where the Mona Lisa hung, took her down with the precision of an expert, hid her under his coat, and walked out.
A wave of such attacks in Chicago were reported, but not the race of the attackers or victims. Media outlets that do not report the race of people committing crimes nevertheless report racial disparities in imprisonment and write heated editorials blaming the criminal justice system.
I don't know why the space between the images was increased and all the posts I edited in the whole blog with images side by side were altered and look awful
We just couldn't do it yet. Our Herman was an unusual one. Instead of the normal black and grey he was brown and white...beautiful. We would let him in and out the back sliding glass door and he never messed in the house after he was older.
At first, it is hard to continue my life after last minute divorce and i don’t want to remind my memories or thinking how those things happen in my life. Forget, forgive and moved on. But the purpose about what i’m trying to convey to all of you is the separated between me and my lovely daughter (Samantha).
I’ve actually worn the same clothes – and shoes – for the last three meetings, just so there’s no difference in terms of my weight. I’ll probably keep doing that, till someone in the class asks me if those are the only clothes I own, or until the pants are so big they fall off me. (Wishful thinking!!)
This is it! The start of "the most wonderful time of year"! I love it!
Hat tip to Frances Bula for the link to the disclosure docs. If you’re a geek for city politics, you need to be reading her excellent blog.
The ego doesn’t realize that the hatred is a projection of the universal pain that you feel inside. The ego believes that this person is causing the pain. It doesn’t realize that the pain is the universal feeling of not being connected with the deeper level of your being – not being at one with yourself.The object of love is interchangeable, as interchangeable as the object of egoic wanting. Some people go through many relationships. They fall in love and out of love many times. They love a person for a while until it doesn’t work anymore, because no person can permanently cover up that pain.Only surrender can give you what you were looking for in the object of your love.
You’re way too young to have a girlfriend, but the sentiment is really sweet and I’m just happy that you’ve made such a good friend.
Our sketch this time was designed by Vicky with the added choice of popping embellishments wherever you wish, I decided to leave well alone as the papers are quite fussy, so my card is really simple.
On the other hand, one thing that I find difficult to style clothes in a hot weather is creating variation with limited items to use. I use layering and accessorizing as a tool to give variation to my wardrobe since I really don’t have many clothes. I miss using different kinds of scarves, being able to wear a winter hat, vest, jacket, coat, boots, socks, you name it. But, I try. I try to be creative.
Do you think that you were put on this earth to be a counselor? You should look into hypnotherapy certification. A lot of folks are considering jobs in the medical or counseling industry, but do not have the time or money to finish the years of school. Hypnotherapy is a really great alternative. Hypnotherapy is the use of hypnosis in a therapy setting to help people conquer the issues they have.
Then there is the movement of conversion to Orthodox Christianity which we see in many parts of the world. In Africa, for example, just in the last fifty years there has been a tremendous movement of conversion of people in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, the Congo (Zaire), and other countries. They are very, very pious and faithful to Orthodoxy. It is just such simple-hearted people that Christ wants, and it is such people who are coming into the Orthodox Church now.

Dani and I hadn't planned to run together, but ended up staying side by side the entire race. Even though we didn't say a word to each other (well I did say sorry when I practically swiped a cup of water out of her hands, whoops :o), it was so nice to just know she was there. Sometimes I wanted to slow down, but I didn't want to lose her, so I just kept on trucking along.

RELDATE… : Apr-21-2012
What makes me most concerned about this corporate structure of churches and why I mention it at all is this: the president of the Mormon Church (which is the president of the corporation that is the Mormon Church) has been known to have one-on-one, secretive (non-public) meetings with the President of the United States behind closed doors in the Oval Office. Shortly after one of these meetings, the noted Professor Steven Jones was fired from Brigham Young University. I can only assume that this was for his exposing the fact that uniquely military-grade Thermate demolition explosives were found in the World Trade Center dust, which is impossible without it have been used to implode those buildings. This is a power that should not be had by any member of any church, whether this particular event was coincidental or not.

The convents that sheltered and educated the women were closed. This increased the number of poor and unprotected women. Any effort to lend them moral and financial support was resisted by the men. Since there were no trained doctors around, people turned to the wise women who used herbs to cure their ailments. The common herbs used in medicines, brews, ointments and potions were mandrake, datura, monkshood, belladonna, henbane and hemlock.
After marinading, take chicken out of the bag and discard the marinade. Grill or broil the chicken 4-5 minutes per side--I used my indoor grill pan. Remove from pan and tent with foil to keep warm.

Physicists say that electrons spin. They don’t, and they can’t. There’s no surface on an electron, since they are energy. They don’t spin, but instead have an electronic potential. Every single particle on this planet, everything you can see, all things in this Universe, are created with polarity. This is new information now. All things are created with polarity, and they’re designed to be self-balancing. And because of the polarity of what you would call plus and minus, they move and try to balance themselves within a field – all things, both physical and other.

Ok, so I have been thinking what new things I can do to reduce my impact on the Earth. I was casually reading over at The Organic Sister and came across the idea of cloth bathroom wipes. Of course! When I had babies, they wore cloth diapers and I washed them. No problem and no trash. I use a Keeper instead of disposable feminine products. No trash created there. So why do I use toilet paper which get flushed, sits in the septic tank, and then goes to the landfill? Because I never thought about it. Now that I have, I am using cloth there too!

In the past few years, my family has been trying to make our lifestyle greener. It's all about the little ways of changing to reduce our carbon footprint - buying local/organic, using reusable shopping bags rather than plastic, consolidating errands so that we drive around less (though we do have 3 SUV's, so take that for what it's worth), and using a clothes line during the summer months rather than run the dryer.
Lastly, for fun, here's Toby Turner's "literal" version, which is very funny. He thinks the villain is actually smelling his sword, which makes even less sense than kissing it. I think I see his lips puckering a tiny bit so I vote for kissing it. Either way, it's weird, right? Anyway, enjoy!
“Everyone in my high school, including me, despised ‘April’ when I was a solo artist,” adds Hart. ”I would be on stage with my acoustic guitar and everyone in town listened to hardcore so you can’t actually make a band with anyone. At the time I was recording in my basement and that was the one song where I said fuck it. I turned up all the settings the opposite way and I just wrote this really pissed-off song. Also, I wrote it the week after the first high school party I ever went to where I wound up getting shit-faced and puking in this kid’s bushes, it was pretty sweet. But I definitely hated the song when I wrote it.”

I think it’s kind of funny, but if you told me I sucked, I would not be happy, but I wouldn’t disagree. If you told me I wasn’t needed, I would simply accept it and go somewhere else, so as to not bother you. If you told me that I wasn’t doing something right, I would not ask for a second chance, but would look for someone else to do it instead.

On Sunday, on my way to the market to buy a water pot, I noticed a flyer on a bulletin board on campus (Foshan University) that said “India Yoga” and lots of other stuff in Chinese that I don’t yet know how to read. It listed two numbers, I took down both, and asked a Chinese teacher at my school to call and translate for me.
Maarten Stekelenburg is the final candidate and is considered, from unnamed sources, the number one priority for United. Stekelenburg has worked with Van Der Sar at International level and has spoken admirably of him to Ferguson. The Ajax keeper shares similarities in that they both have played for the Amsterdam club and risen through their infamous academy, whilst also both have pulled on the orange jersey of Holland. Stekelenburg has the advantage that he has contested in a World Cup final and thus is used to big game scenarios.
I have been told that I am supposed to talk with Viarmo, the head of the college, about joining, and my name-discerning sixth sense has just spotted him. I wonder if he’ll want to hear my ballad now or after the coronation. Of course, I’d be happy to sing it twice, too. I just hope instrument proficiency isn’t part of the initiation because all of my skills in that department are self-taught. It should come as no surprise that there are not any Orc musicians to tutor young children interested in becoming a bard. Confidently, I stroll up to Viarmo and announce that I am interested in joining the college.

I also spent a few lovely hours on Saturday afternoon shopping on Newbury Street with my friend (and birthday girl!), Marina. We loved seeing the new spring clothes lighting up the window displays with splashes of bright colors. It made me yearn for spring/summer to hurry up and get here already!!! Even though it is supposed to get up to 60 this week, my toes are still enclosed in riding boots and my outfits are still dominated by sweaters and scarves.

Here they look a little red, but they are PINK! I hand cut my little branch for the owl to sit on.
The U.S. government and the politicians that run it are addicted to spending more money than the government takes in. If we look at it conservatively, and only look at the government’s “official” figures, by the end of this decade, our national debt will be about 150% of our GDP—about the same level it was after World War II.

While obviously they are only two examples out of a growing number in the local area, the Railway at Rose Hill now has a very smart elevated, covered area of wooden decking at the rear, while the beer garden at the Armoury in Edgeley, once little more than a patch of grass, now has two substantial separate shelters and bears a distinct resemblance to a grotto. More and more pubs now have a sign outside advertising, amongst other facilities, “Covered, heated smoking patio,” while another proclaims “Plasma Screen TV for smokers” – so it’s becoming an important point of differentiation.

There are several other plot lines that interweave with the main plot including the love-hate relationship between former childhood friends who went different paths throughout their lives. The smartest kid in school plots his revenge on the bully-jock, Mike, after years of torture. Amanda coping with her break-up on an identity-crisis level. Mike breaking up with Amanda to hook-up with college girls. The list goes on and on.

This has been on the table for a long while now—"no justice, no peace" as they put it, meaning social justice, the name injustice goes by, and there's been no backing down on their end. This, unwisely, is doubling down. It's always the same: short term clever, long term stupid. Mr. Frazier hasn't thought this through. Martin King was a violent man personally but he got it right when he told his more militant followers to keep the meaning of the word minority in mind. Being 13% of the population is not good odds should the check Mr. Frazier has written be cashed.

I met with somebody yesterday who spoke of his problems being so stubborn, no solution could turn things around. He said, “I’ve tried everything but the problem won’t go away.” When I asked why, it was clear to me that while the problem had gone away, he was still the same person, creating the same pattern of decisions that got him into trouble in the first place. I am not going to claim I know all the problems people have but I will say this; its probably because some people would love to have the problem around.

In these ‘post feminist’ times, we women spend a lot of time wondering why it is that we don’t yet share the complete set of privileges that our male counterparts do, whether it’s examining how we treat each other, how much money we spend on cosmetics and clothes or how our very genetic make-up, from brain and hormonal balances to our built-in ability to bear children, affects how we relate with the world.

People talk about denial as if it’s a bad thing. If I’d been able to deny grief and just go on living as if my mate of thirty-four years hadn’t died, I’d probably have done so. Grief is debilitating, disorienting, causes innumerable physical and emotional reactions, makes one susceptible to cancer, accidents, and other closer-to-death encounters and on top of that, it’s just downright painful.
Suddenly my hours drastically changed. I went from working 8:30 to 5:30 every day, to working as early as 7am to as late as 9pm. They would call me during my work day and say, "Hey listen there's a ball game we got last minute tickets for we need you to stay until 9. We will pay you extra and buy you some dinner!" I agreed because I loved the babies and for fear they would get upset if I didn't. What started out as one night every so often became multiple days a week. Eventually there was not a single week I worked under 50 hours, and most were getting up to 70 hours. I was there from the time the babies woke up til they went to bed. The dad was always the one who paid me, so I began asking nicely about my extra pay. He would always say oh yeah I'll just throw it in there on pay day. Then on pay day it wouldn't be there so I would say "What about my money for working late?" He would say "I forgot... I promise next time I will though." This happened over and over. They also promised me holidays off but began calling me in on holidays promising me extra pay and never following through. One holiday I came in the entire day, 12 hours, they promised to provide me my meals but never did so I worked and was starving all day. Anyways despite this I stayed because I loved the babies so much.
Half a decade ago, I read Sheila Walsh's excellent book on depression, The Heartache No One Sees. I had never heard of Sheila before (despite her fame as a singer, speaker, and writer), but I was quickly taken in by her transparency, hard-knocks wisdom, and obvious heart for encouragement. Her words were a lifeline to me, and I've admired her ever since. So when her latest book, God Loves Broken People, became available on Booksneeze, I snatched it up.

Okay, enough of this, let's wrestle with the plot now. Lincoln Hawk (Sly) is a struggling independent truck driver who's trying to rebuild his life after a divorce from his wife Christina (Susan Blakely). As she lay dying, her final wish is that she reclaims his son Michael (David Mendenhall), who has taken the last name of his grandfather Jason (Robert Loggia), a rich and powerful man who had been instrumental in keeping Lincoln and Christina apart. Lincoln does his best to mend fences but Michael is a stubborn military school-bred brat who doesn't think much of being abandoned for the open lure of the road.
Many of our friends who stayed were killed. One by one they disappeared in tragic deaths, either blown apart or slowly dying as a result of being wounded by weapons usually reserved for the destruction of physical structures and military vehicles. Snipers fired anti-aircraft bullets that ripped bodies into shreds and detached limbs and heads within a fraction of a second. Some of us witnessed these happenings and some of us heard about them from others. No matter how it was delivered, the information about our friends’ deaths echoed painfully through our hearts.
With the government's maternity reforms, time will tell if more midwives are able to sustain private practice.

According to former Mayor of Belfast Tom Hartley, who now organises tours of parts of West Belfast, as a child he used to run past the cemetery gates because of stories he heard about the devil appearing there one night. He had also read a pamphlet called ‘The Devil that Dances’, which was written by Father Gerald O’Carroll, a priest at Clonard monastery. It presumably condemned the fact that some of the ground in the cemetery was not consecrated and was therefore heretical. Naturally a youngsters’ imagination would conjure images of a cloven-hoofed devil prowling around such a place. Nowadays he attributes the uneasiness he felt going past the cemetery to the undercurrent of sectarianism and segregation at the time. As a Catholic he associated the cemetery with British-leaning Protestantism, and believed that the people buried in it were somehow ‘different’, as the majority of them weren’t Catholic. Throughout the 1970s a lot of vandalism occurred in the cemetery and Protestants wouldn’t visit it because of its location in West Belfast – a predominantly Catholic community. That has thankfully changed now, though the desecration of so many of the graves by hoodlums is still evident.

Catholic Charities has offices in many American cities, busily importing and planting wonderful diversity in the “immigrant nation.” They brought in the Rwandan “refugee” Beatrice Munyenyezi to Manchester, New Haven, where she is now on trial for her participation in genocide. They boast how “Kurds have changed Nashville”, as the Kurdish Pride Gang undoubtedly has. As the primary Tennessee fiduciary agency for the U.S. feds’ project of replacing America’s root stocks with alien barbarians, Catholic Charities probably plays down such predictable consequences as the 29 Somali Bantu gangbangers on trial in Nashville for trafficking Somali girls as young as 12 for sex in several American cities. More on such benefits of imported Wonderful Diversity — and that’s just in one state, Tennessee — here. All this is financed by the U.S. taxpayer, and implemented mostly by Christian charities. What could possibly go wrong for people of faith, the little Lambs?

Burke also hints at the fact that if ‘six million Muslims of France’ were really radicalised – then France would certainly know about it. Is it really that simple? The population of France is still, I think, around sixty million. It also has an army, a strong police force, a security service and all the rest. Taking into account all these things, even a sizable minority of six million Muslims would still think twice about an overwhelming show of force against the French Government or against the millions of non-Muslim French citizens. Radical Islamists know that because there are no mountains to hide in, as there are in Pakistan and Afghanistan, an overwhelming or systematic attack on the French Government, or the French people, would be pretty unwise, to say the least. It would quite simply be crushed. Thus small acts of terrorism and the rest is all the Islamists have to go on in France and indeed in the UK. Anything more than that would simply backfire. So what is Burke expecting these radicalised Muslims to do (even if we take them to be radicalised)? Even one million radicalised Muslims would not be foolish enough to take on a centralised government, with its army, police, etc. and a country of sixty million people. And, as I argued before, it could be the case that there is a million radicalised Muslims in France (or England), but even then only a few thousand or so would be actively radical.

But I am also looking forward to having one more “ball” in the air come down. With the Aussie’s departure, I will no longer have an ex-boyfriend that I feel compelled to entertain and include in my life, simply due to the fact that while he was here, he really didn’t have anybody.
I mean am I making this up? Could their policy really be so strict as to deny entrance to a woman with two small children on a Sunday afternoon? Please tell me that it is because the other reality is too ugly to imagine.

About 20 minutes drive along the coast towards Kuala Terengganu we found the Bukit Keluang Beach Resort. This is a nice place to stay, and the staff are very friendly. The only disappointment was the pool. The beaches nearby are very nice, so the pool is not so important. While waiting for the next day’s boat to Perhentian Island, I’d stay either here or at the T’Lodge, the latter costing about one half to one third of the former. Without a car, of course T’Lodge is far more convenient.

First, let's look at the difference between staffed legal assistance programs and volunteers. Staff, of course, are paid employees. Volunteers, though they may have their expenses covered, are donating their time. Staff are typically in career positions. Their country assignments last 2-3 years. They frequently work on contract and often move from employer to employer, sometimes working for a national government or an international body and sometimes working for an NGO. Their career arc depends on performance evaluations and references. Conversely, the volunteer is usually in country for a year or less, though many stay longer and often use the volunteer assignment as a springboard to a new career.

Since my last post, “Hello!”, where I voiced some personal concerns, I feel as though my poetry writing has taken another turn, and it’s certainly for the better. When I wrote “Hello!”, I was feeling a little put-out; I was lacking confidence and worrying a whole lot about meeting and exceeding my readers expectations. Now, things feel a little calmer; though that’s not to say I still remain — not so much anxious — but eager to make my writing better. I hope that comes across.

Verse 10 is an example of Hebrew poetry. The first line is explained by the second line. ‘Your kingdom comes’ = ‘your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.’ How is praying this portion of the Lord’s prayer an expression of love for God (see Matthew 26:36-39).

A word of warning though – Skyrim has been plagued with issues. Bugs, game crashes etc. I personally have experienced no issues whatsoever but a lot of people have so it would be remiss of me not to mention them. The game has been patched several times so hopefully these problems have now gone.
Wallace’s problem with Natural Selection having created humans as we now know them was that it was far too slow to have produced the multitude of the subtleties that distinguish the human mind from our cousin species. A single specific adaptation might proceed quickly like skin color of a human population that moved from a very sunny environment to a very dim one, but external climate events shouldn’t have any influence on such things as the ability to speak, sing, dance and make decisions about future events and responses to them based on thinking. All of these abilities and many more arose very quickly in humans and Wallace thought that some Overruling Intelligence was needed.

“So I tell you, don’t worry about everyday life — whether you have enough food, drink, and clothes. Doesn’t life consist of more than food and clothing? Look at the birds. They don’t need to plant or harvest or put food in barns because your heavenly Father feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than they are. Can all your worries add a single moment to your life? Of course not. And why worry about your clothes? Look at the lilies and how they grow. They don’t work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are. And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and gone tomorrow, won’t he more surely care for you? You have so little faith! So don’t worry about having enough food or drink or clothing. Why be like the pagans who are so deeply concerned about these things? Your heavenly Father already knows all your needs, and he will give you all you need from day-to-day if you live for him and make the Kingdom of God your primary concern. So don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today’s trouble is enough for today.” (Matthew 6:25-34)

So there are positive people (who has bad moments too), negative people (who has good moments too), fake positive people (who claimed they’re always positive), and then we have confused positive people.

I think, too, that Samantha Brown (from The Travel Channel) hit the nail on the head when she said that visiting England was, at least for Americans, Europe-light. It is exotic for us with the differences in food, accents, and dialects, but it’s not way outside our comfort zones. Traveling to London from the US seems kind of like visiting, say, Atlanta when you’re from Minneapolis—go with me on this one. Some accents are hard to manage, sure, but they still speak English and you can make yourself understood. Some of the food is decidedly different from what you’d find on your table at home, but it’s recognizable and you can find something you like. Your trip is full of new and exciting experiences, and you don’t have to worry about whether or not you can read the street signs.

When thoroughly dry add your stalk, twist and go to the next one.Want to remove the caulk ever? Again easy, slip a screw driver under it and pop them off.

Selling an EKG machine or a blood pressure gauge is obviously not as simple as marketing a t-shirt, food, or something that most people in the world have a need for. Initial thoughts into the topic may bring up the question – is there really a market for medical devices? Considering the success of the company I work for, I can definitely say yes to that. The problem becomes reaching out to the target audience, of which a significant portion are older people who think iPads and laptops are scary monstrosities.
Originally published for adults, the Muse thinks this classic fantasy book would make a good read for the young adult market (which did not exist back then, would you believe?) Despite the example above, don’t expect too much in the way of actual snogging. But there’s plenty of adventure, atmosphere, and wonderful dragons to keep you happy, and Anne McCaffrey's typically strong scientific background should appeal to the more inquiring reader. If you haven’t read any of her Dragonrider books yet, give them a try! They're the original and the best.

It’s easy to see how this applies to something like evolution. Organisms do increase in complexity and orderedness (which sounds like it should be a word) over time, but like the acorn growing into an oak tree, the rest of life on the planet takes in energy from various environmental sources, particularly the Sun. We’re more complex and less disordered than our ancestors, but increased entropy levels elsewhere mean that the thermodynamics police won’t be needing to make any arrests. Chaos in the universe overall is behaving as it should.

Here’s the thing, I know this sounds ridiculous, but the traveling life is EXHAUSTING. Especially if you’re on a tight budget. You never have privacy, because you’re sleeping in a room with 6 other people, but you also rarely have someone to see things with, since everyone is usually doing their own thing. And yes, you meet new friends, and it’s amazing to talk to all of these new people from new places and get new perspectives on life – but sometimes you just want to sleep without someone coming in at 2AM, or worry someone will steal your things in the night.

We had planned on cheese and biscuits followed by coffee, liqueurs and mints but as it was 1am before we hit the puds they fell by the wayside. All of us had wee ones to deal with in the morning so the 2.30am bedtime we eventually succumbed to was pushing all our boundaries. Ah, if you can't push it on NYE when can you? Eating your way to midnight is a sure sign that you've passed the first flush of youth is it not? But you know what, I like this second flush of youth, my friends are long term and my cooking has come on a treat. The wee ones gifted us an early night, all slept through without a murmur allowing us grown ups to slip into a more relaxed state as the night sped past.

Put the candy coating disks in a microwave-safe bowl and melt them. Bakerella recommends 30 seconds at 50% power, stirring and repeating until melted. Drop the balls, one at a time, into the candy coating (or put them on sticks and dip them). Use a teaspoon to lift the ball out, tap the excess coating off and place on a cookie sheet. THIS IS IMPORTANT: The coating dries quickly--If you're going to sprinkle stuff on it, now's the time to do it! If you're going to get all fancy like the book and make adorable faces, etc. on the cake balls, you'll have to follow the directions in the book.

Data presented at the 2004 annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology reaffirmed the “J-curve.”16 A study of 22,576 patients treated for hypertension showed that the death rate dropped until a nadir (lowest point) was reached at a diastolic pressure of 84 mmHg. When the diastolic pressure fell below 84 mmHg, then patient deaths and heart attacks rose again. For example, those with a diastolic of 70 mmHg had 20% greater risk, at 65 mmHg the risk was 80% greater, and at 55 mmHg the risk was four times higher than at 84 mmHg.

And Polly at eighteen months is not very far behind Pip. She follows him everywhere and mimics him relentlessly. In the process she has learned – and, I expect, will continue to learn - much of whatever he is into. For example, she is already grasping some of the things Pip and I are working on at home. She can count to four, recognize some letters, and identify a couple of shapes. She is also becoming more capable with writing instruments like crayons and markers. And she is quite skilled at managing interactions with people of all ages. Preschool can’t hold a candle to the education gained from having an older sibling.

Unholy Grave, are, on record, much better than they were on stage at this show. I can’t quite put my finger on it, but they lacked something essential during this performance. Maybe it was the sound? Maybe it was the fact I was expecting a Napalm Death style assault of pure old school grindcore? Whatever it was, I got bored pretty quickly and left about 20 minutes into the set. What I did see and hear was a mash of straight out death metal, and Terrorizer-esque sloppy grind, never moving into hyper-blasting, and actually only occasionally blasting in a way I’d have liked to have seen more of. Never mind, I like them when I put them on the player, and the fans were going ape shit for them, so everyone’s a winner. 2 FISTS.

Ken Brooks of Cengage Learning was all business. Publishers are caught in a vise, as less cash for operations meets lower profits from products. Efficiently managing process, vendors, and technology is key. If each new project requires a different flow of process, you’re dying the death of a thousand cuts. It’s better to determine one or two ways to work, and have the discipline to stick to them, “ruthless management of complexity and standards is more efficient.”

“Charon clearly has way too much time on his hands during this pre-Christmas period. This is largely because no-one wants to do any business with him because his clients are all attending Christmas parties or farting around on Twitter.

Really the biggest problem with this movie, other than really being nothing substantial, is how much of a lack of a link there is with the previous movies. There is something thrown in pretty ham fistedly, but other than this small tie there is nothing that the fans of the original can enjoy. Take away the one thing and give this movie another title and it would come off stronger as people wouldn’t be comparing this to the previous movies.
So what is the second surprise in the cake? Well, just keepin it real -in my haste to get 6 layers of cake in the proper order all frosted and perfect, I forgot to pull the parchment paper off the yellow layer of cake. I cut into the cake, everyone waiting for the big surprise, and I felt some resistance, then I felt a bit of embarrassment. I knew exactly what the problem was. I cut through the parchment to get the first piece out, then I gently pulled the entire piece of parchment out of the rest of the cake - voila! What a relief!
In responding to the prayer for renewal of Pope John XXIII (ca.1962), the Lord has, in His own sovereign power, initiated a work of spiritual renewal in His Church that permits us to reclaim the fullness of our legacy in Christ (cf., “The Charismatic Renewal”). By His Grace, I am a participant in this movement of His Grace and I am here to proclaim to you the Good News that the grace of God is here for you also – the Kingdom of God is here for you to enter into the fullness of His blessings and receive the Empowerment Gifts of the Spirit through the Baptism in the Holy Spirit, just as was prophesied by the Apostle Peter at Pentecost (cf., Acts 2:38-39). As the Apostle Paul once said, “As God’s fellow workers we urge you not to receive God’s grace in vain. For he says, ‘In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.’ I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation!” (2 Cor. 6:1-2)

Once you find that page from your dashboard, you can select the option to convert your pages to Mobile-friendly on mobile devices.

There are some bloggers who don’t realize that their text doesn’t show up on mobile devices because your backgrounds don’t show up. For one particular blog I attempted to visit on the mobile phone there is a white background and white text… makes it kind of difficult to read it.

Yet I decided we should finish up with these batches before moving on to make the next set of dosa recipes.

As her dying act, she devises an antidote so those who have to stop taking the cure may live on.

In F.L. Carsten’s The Rise of Fascism, the author examines the development of European fascism in several countries including Italy, Germany, Spain, Finland, Austria, Hungary, and others. The majority of the book focuses on narrating the development of fascist movements in each nation followed by a short chapter that seeks out similarities. By taking a comparative approach, Carsten presents factors he believes were important to the development of fascism into a viable political ideology. The narrative examines the years leading up to the First World War to the beginnings of the Second World War with a concluding chapter on neo- fascism. While the author has no explicit argument, his stated purpose is to explain how fascism developed, became a mass movement, and seized power in countries of ancient culture, high education, and “a tradition of civilized behavior.” (8) To achieve his objective, the author uses political speeches, newspapers, and diaries to narrate the rise of fascist political parties throughout interwar Europe.
There are several Western scholars who argue that the pyramid on the seabed may have been initially made on the mainland, after which a devastating earthquake struck and changed the landscape completely. Other scientists argue that a few hundred years ago the waters of the Bermuda Triangle area may have as one of the cornerstone activities of the people of Atlantis, and Pyramids on the sea floor may be a supply warehouse for them. Perhaps it is related to the underwater race of humanoids discovered in Washington State in 2004 – the so called “aquatic ape” beings?

It is interesting how late the pacifist tendency in Doctor Who came in. Back here in the Hartnell era, there was no attempt at a critique of violence in the stories. Here it is Vicky instigating a violent and bloody revolution that wins the day.
I’m still breathing
Several weeks passed, and the many voices seemed to be right. My ability to breathe declined. It is imperative to notice that the small still voice made me no promises, my only command was to “trust.” A well known man of God from the last century said this “Lord, may I be an ox on the altar or an ox in the field.” None of is really know our purpose here in life, what we do know is that we have been called to bring honor to the name of Jesus, regardless of our situation.

Stan G is not only a gentlemen, he is also a funny guy and still extremely prolific. At the con he was drawing sketch after sketch for fans, and we discussed his latest job. The funniest moment was when he told me: "You know, I was thinking of you guys (the Yancy Street Gang) when I was drawing the Three Stooges." Well, aside from getting poked in the eye from Stan G, what more could we ask for?

The manager of Otis Day & The Knights did stick to that plan though. To the extreme. Drafted all offense and relief pitchers until the 22nd round. Not knowing that you need 6 starting pitchers on your squad probably had a lot to do with that, however. He still wound up with some really good starting pitching and picked up a few more after the draft via free agency. That's the idea with this plan. Load up on offense and scavenge for pitching. It can really work if you stay diligent. And a team built around an offense with Troy Tulowitzki and Justin Upton is pretty daunting.
Now usually I would never thumbnail from a trailer because normally trailers aren't continuity....they're snippets from all over the film, not meant to work in context with each other. But this is different...this trailer is built like a piece of film and all the scenes are in continuity. First off, I have to say that it's done in a really over-dramatic style. It's super pushed, doing things I consider over-the-top....like, for example, the push in on the villain at 0:38 where he goes into slow motion (pretty cheesy!) and the moment where he draws his sword at 2:09 and then kisses it. At least I think he kissed it. His lips seemed to pucker a tiny bit. Anyway, again, pretty cheesy...but hey, that's just my opinion. I like it when people push the boundaries and go over-the-top, it helps you figure out where your own personal tastes lay, and makes you realize what you think is too much. Other than that, I really like the dynamic staging of this piece and I got a lot out of thumbnailing it.
Smoky oak notes, savoury bacon and spicy. Tight, but elegant, fine grain smoky tannins dominate the palate right now. Coffee flavours, touches of leather, deep rich plums and rich dried fruit. Lovely now, but could age well as tight tannins balance the fruit really well – 90/100 points.

Although I agreed it was a wonderful approach, this idea of “job- shadowing” each featured subject wasn’t going to be easy. Would these high-powered, important women deign to allow us that kind of access? Would they be able to impart the kind of wisdom that would resonate with our readers and truly make a difference in their lives? We looked at each other, both of us hooked on a crazy idea that we weren’t sure we could pull off.

As much as I am at peace with my decision to close the door on my friendship with my friend that named her baby Jack - I am feeling like this decision may have also cost me other friendships. I am not really sure why or how I would be the "bad" guy in this situation - and I momentarily felt bad for her - but then I remembered that she got to take her baby home and all this wouldn't have ever happened if she would have chosen a different name. The one thing that would crush me - she did....so I am not sure what I did wrong. I did what I had to do to deal with it and move forward.
We threw my sister a surprise party on November 20. A bunch of her friends and a lot of my family showed up to celebrate my little sis turning the big 3-0. We had a ball and she seriously had no clue. That night, as I attempted to sneak off to put Maeve to bed, I nursed her like usual. Got her in her pjs and then as I was walking to her room, she preceded to vomit all over me. She starting giggling and was happy instantaneously after and slept with no problems. The next night again, vomit after dinner. So that following Monday I took her to the pediatrician. I thought a stomach bug or strep throat. I never thought urinary tract infection, so when the ped mentioned something about the possibility of a catheter, I thought, "Hmm, strange!" I talked to my sis, the ped who said "Let them do the cath", so when the ped said we needed to do it, I agreed. After about 6-8 minutes with me holding my poor girl's legs while she screamed and Mo sat in her seat screaming "Don't touch my sis. Oh, poor Maevie" the doc finally got the catheter in, to find almost no urine. Luckily, she was able to get enough to run the test. I went home with a script and instructions which left me surprised. The doc recommended we take her to a get an ultrasound and a VCUG to rule out any issues with her anatomy.
So those who like kits will have a kit to purchase. Those who have been wanting instructions right away will also have instrucitons to purchase for a second project!

Where was I...right, the man wearing flip-flops. While waiting in line, I happened to glance down at his feet and was treated to the nastiest thing. Ugly toe nails. Now, before you get all hopped up, let me clarify that there is a difference between toe nails that aren't attractive and UGLY toe nails. These were ugly. I would even go so far as to say they were fugly. Fugly nails, people. They were a weird brownish-yellowish color and they looked like they could take a layer of skin off if they were to attack you. Needless to say I was not only traumatized by this but I was also unable to look away. It was like a train wreck, you don't want to look but you can't stop looking.
She initially put forward to Indian Govt. that she studied in Cambridge University which proved to be fake. She submitted an affidavit that she studied english in Bell Education trust at Cambridge. Even this was proven to be fake and was found she never got any education after class five.
The president’s grim pronouncements failed to reassure a US commitment to international law or to provide an analysis to justify a future of perpetual armed conflict and, as both Obama and Panetta postulated the pretense of victory in Iraq, neither acknowledged the 800-pound gorilla in the room that if the systematic destruction of Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of U.S. interventions was an example of providing for a ‘safer, more stable, prosperous world,’ then perhaps the world would be better off if the United States stayed at home and minded its own business..

My big boo got his wisdom teeth out and was quite loopy for hours! In fact that's were I was when I got the phone call that she was at the wrong bus stop. The oral surgeon's office. Not a great place to be at 8:15 a.m. on a Monday morning! But thankfully...he made it through...so far he's ok. One side is pretty bad...but the others are fine. The pain meds they gave him had the opposite effect on him. He was wired out....wouldn't sleep and wanted to play video games that were quite frankly giving me vertigo. Not to mention the fact that he was playing a racing one and kept hitting the walls. ( not the best time to play a race video!)

Do you know what bothers me? I'm bothered by what I call, "so-called karate experts." They're the guys that are always in bars, getting drunk and causing trouble. They bump into you, steal your drinks, and hit on your wife or girlfriend. They also strut around like they own the world and are always talking crap. They're always telling hot women, and everyone who will listen that they hold multiple degrees in Karate, Aikido, Taekwondo, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.

What happens when you engage in a conversation with someone in the car or on the telephone even when using a hands free device? Most of the time your brain is working over time to think of what you are going to say next or to listen to what they are saying. How many times have you missed your exit or missed your turn because you were engaged in a conversation? Worse yet, have you ever had the other person say to you, "Aren't you supposed to turn here?"

Example #1 - As we approached Mile 1, there was a volunteer announcing times and another traffic volunteer standing in the road with a 'slow' sign. Mr. Fix-It then proceeds to say, "Dude, I know we're slow, but do we REALLY need a sign telling the whole world?" It garnered many chuckles.
it was tolerated. Hasn’t this always been the case with Torchwood? People always seem to be so wronged by this series, as if it’s gone out of its way to attack them personally. Even Children of Earth, arguably the jewel in its crown, had its detractors – mostly those who couldn’t bear to see Ianto killed off. Russell T Davies allegedly got death threats over that one, the poor man. These are the same people who refer to the first two seasons as the “real” Torchwood, yet everything that comes after warrants no reference at all. Still others would argue that Children of Earth was the only decent thing ever produced under the franchise name. The real truth, it seems, is that there is no real Torchwood. The series is like Russell T Davies’ personal narrative playground, to do with as he pleases, with whomever he pleases, as the revolving talent roster (both in front of and behind the camera) seems to suggest. Miracle Day further proves that it’s an ongoing experimental work in progress, as it once again offers up storytelling that’s quite unlike all that’s come before.

Greybeard is not a novel to be read for its plot; there really is little to the story other than Greybeard's reflections on the changing scenery and how those changes were wrought. There is little overt conflict, unless one counts that inevitable conflict with that unbeaten champion of Death. Some readers might find this 239 page novel to be dull for these absences, but for those who are willing to consider the themes, especially that of aging and the reluctant acceptance of one's impending doom, Greybeard might prove to be one of the more quiet, yet powerful, masterpieces of post-apocalyptic literature produced during the past half-century.
Where I am born is far from where I am living
I’ve been back in the states for about five days now. Life seems to be in a whirlwind state getting settled back into the everyday norm. My body decided it doesn’t like jet lag. While dealing with the time difference my sinuses decided to rage a war in my head. I can’t really complain too much though because Ireland was well worth the visit. My fear of not fitting well into the plane seat was justified and I think that if I was not sitting next to my brother it would have been an issue. I still have a long way to go in my goal to lose weight. This just gives me more of a push to keep going on my journey. Hopefully next time I fly I will fit comfortably. The flight attendants on both flights were very nice. I asked the attendant who greets you as soon as you walk onto the plane if I could have a seatbelt extender. They discretely handed me one no questions asked. Everyone was friendly and I did not feel judged at all. Thank you United Airlines!

Fortunately, the great thing about golf gifts is the range — not the driving, range, the price range!

Sadly he tried to prepare himself for the inevitable and then a flash of inspiration entered his mind.

Back in October I experienced a severe depression. Over the last few days I could feel the same symptoms coming on again. I knew that the previous episode had been triggered by an argument with this colleague. I had thought I was over all the depression. But seeing it come back in identical form made me realise that drugs and CBT weren’t going to help me anymore. I’d seen the psychiatric nurse recently and I’m on a huge dose of anti-depressants. I needed something different. I was beginning to think the key to my healing was in this relationship with this person and the buttons she was pressing. I was in so much confusion and turmoil that I knew I couldn’t make sense of all this on my own. I knew I needed to talk to someone, and I knew exactly who to ring.
The Electrician and I turned off the computers, and then we closed the windows and then we went searching for Ms. Baby..pfft…she was under the bed.

Please see my article on the MediaPad to see how you should backup your device. In addition Google now has the feature to backup your apps and data. Do note though that when you enable this, you may have issues if you are running apps that you installed “personally”, so be cautious since Google ain’t very nice on the way they go about things. Recently they had removed over 50 apps that had violated their store policies (including apps that allow downloading youtube applications), and they have even gone ahead and removed it from all devices that had downloaded it from the store!

This disgusting and archaic war on women needs to stop before it really begins to steamroll forward. Old white men should have no say about what goes on between a woman and her doctor, or between a woman and her body.

Virgil, the trucker hat guy, runs Vbg-log, which is the site through which I became aware of Musings of a Smartass (see above). I think Vbg-log was one of the first beer blogs I encountered on the web and likely it was one reason I decided I’d like to try my hand at beer-blogging, too. To know that Virgil’s tire tracks can be found here at Beer Rant now and then is a reassuring thing to me somehow.
Yes, I am late to the party. I am aware that Earth day was last Friday not today. I had the best of intentions to post this last Friday but life got in the way. However I thought this was such a good thing that I am going to go ahead and share it with you now, even if it is late. What is it? Well by now I assume a lot of us are bringing our own reusable shopping bags with us to the grocery store, but what about all those plastic bags we use when buying our fruits and vegetables? I know most people are still using the plastic bags provided at the grocery store and if you are anything like we are, they just get thrown away, they aren't good for anything else that I know of. I felt bad that it was such a waste so I got to thinking of a way to make a reusable produce bag and here is what I came up with. This idea is so simply and an idea that I am sure others have thought of so I am a little embarrassed to show it to you but if I thought it was cool and something very useful to help us cut down on waste, I am sure someone else will to so here you go, Reusable Produce Bags.

The only Jack Vance work I have read to date is The Last Castle, which to be honest I don't remember all that well, so it must not have made a huge impression on me. I have Songs of the Dying Earth on my shelf to read, but have not yet read it. I guess the point I am trying to make is that I think I could have written a better review for this if I was familiar with the original short story in more depth. This graphic novel feels like a sketch of what the full story probably was.

Once again, injuries had trimmed our eighteen man squad down to twelve fit players. Many of us arrived in the new Burridge tracksuits which club manager, Paul Dyke, had bought for just over a £100. I too had worn mine. It's a navy blue two piece shell suit made by Jani, which no doubt alerted the suspicion of the security guard inside Tesco on Burgess Road, when I stopped in for a Lucozade. Back in my car I heard a nasty ripping sound coming from the stitching in the garment's shoulder when I reached over to my glove compartment. Fortunately, no damage appears to have been done.

Let me give you an example. Recently I was in the market for a new printer because the cartridge holder in the old one had broken. We’d managed to fix it with an elastic band but once the item was damaged, it was somehow easier to see how much we were spending on ink cartridges and how little we seemed to be getting from each one. So I was reluctant to replace like-for-like but couldn’t really see that I had many options for a home-office printer.

On the other hand, I’ve gotten a niece and have had such a tremendous wealth of love and support to get me through the horrible times. My life is so tremendously blessed. I shouldn’t have to compare my life to what’s happening abroad to gain perspective, but sometimes I do. I have more than enough food, more than enough first-world creature comforts, and a government that (while I may not always agree with them) won’t massacre my loved ones just because I disagree.
I also noticed that the Bonvita rice milk chocolate soaked into the biscuits because it was quite thin so then I melted some Tropical Source chocolate chips (not soy free) and I put that between a few biscuits.

Me: L: Here’s another claim: Santa Claus is imaginary. I am dismissing the claim that Santa exists, because no one has presented any evidence for his existence. In a sense (but still not really), I am making a claim, but my “claim” is accurate as far as our knowledge has progressed, so saying that Santa is imaginary or not real is not making a claim, it is simply a rebuttal to a statement that has no evidence. I don’t need evidence. That which has been presented without evidence can be just as easily dismissed without evidence.

Pseudo-Chrys.: It is one thing to be broken, and another to be ground to powder. Of what is broken there remains something; but what is ground to powder is as it were converted into dust. And what falls upon a stone is not broken by any power of the stone, but because it fell heavily, either by reason of its weight, or of its fall from a great height So a Christian in sinning, perishes, but not to the utmost that Christ can destroy; but only so far as he destroys himself, either by the greatness of his sin, or by his exalted rank. But the unbelievers perish to the utmost that Christ can destroy them.
I wish you would have chosen life, I wish I hadn’t of missed your phone call that night, maybe things would be different, maybe you would be here still. All these things they haunt me. I think about you when life gets hard, I talk of you when others are in need of council, I think of your mom, dad and sisters and the pain they must be in, the only thing I haven’t done is honestly tell people how much this hurts. How a year later I can’t forget, I can’t forgive, I can’t put stitches in a wound that doesn’t want to heal.

Arabic is written and read from right to left, the opposite of English. Something I find fascinating is that Arabic books which were written 1,500 years ago can be read and understood by any Arabic speaking person today. English didn’t even exist back then, and other languages that were in existence like Persian, Chinese and Greek have changed so much over time that older texts in those languages can only be read by scholars. Written Arabic is so beautiful it stands on its own as lovely artwork. Many Arabian homes display gorgeous artwork consisting of Arabic calligraphy made out of a variety of mediums such as metal or paint.

I want to take this opportunity to thank those who served our country in a way that nobody else can. The majority of those who serve do not come from wealth, they are not paid like senators or congress persons. They do not have the opportunity to give themselves pay raises or extended benefits but must struggle to live on the pay and benefits bestowed on them by those who, in most cases, have not served.

The thing about losing someone that you love is that you don't want to forget them, no matter how much better the latter would be for you. You want, at least for a while, to wallow in what it is that you've lost.
This just hit my inbox and what timing. I just cleaned Cassie's room, let me just say it was unbearable, it gets this way all the time. Everything is dumped out and you can't walk in the room without stepping on something. Yes I clean it when I *need* it clean, she usually starts to help once I get going, trust me I realize this is my issue. Anyway I just cleaned it after it being a disaster for some time, I can let it go a bit... unclench, pull that stick out, splinter by splinter...
Well hats seemed to get everybody going last week: it was one of our most popular themes ever. In commenting on Jinksy's post, Little Nell suggested a doll theme for Sepia Saturday. It seemed like a good idea to me, so here we are. This delightful 1937 picture was taken by the American photographer Nickolas Muray and is part of the George Eastman House Collection available via Flickr Commons. If you are following the theme - remember, you don't have to - all you need to do is to post your old image and your new reflections on or around Saturday the 21st January 2012 and link to the list below.

This epic Body of Works is exploring Crochet and the Aesthetic of Funk as an Inspirational alternative lifestyle of Deliverance into self sustainability. This concept of personally designing in the aesthetic of Funk, is suited for the sensibility of all creative communities and all those who feel the Tribe-Vibe call of Nature.

I know starburst mirrors are everywhere, but they were nowhere in my home, and I haven't tired of seeing them. I think the mirror is a good size for the space and I like how the star of the mirror breaks up all the straight lines of the TV, windows and frames.

I'm bad at keeping secrets. There. I said it.
On the review copy front I've been quite lucky. First up is Adam Christopher's debut Empire State, which will be read in short order. Did someone say Noir and bubble universe? Next is Theodora Goss' latest novella, The Thorn and the Blossom, which is actually a pair of novellas telling the same story for two points of view. And get this: it is an accordion binding with no spine. If you don't know what I mean go visit Goss' site for some pics. It also comes in a nice slipcase and I predict big things for the book come its January release. I was very happy to win a signed copy of Martha Wells' The Serpent Sea and that's another that will be read in short order. The Mirage is Matt Ruff's latest novel that definitely seems PKD inspired. Ruff's Fool on the Hill is still one of my all-time favorite novels. Winning Mars is technically Jason Stoddard's debut despite the book originally being a short story and then a longer version released for free via his site. Massive changes were undertaken for the Prime Books release that mergers Mars and reality TV in the future. From Prime is also Lightspeed: Year One edited by John Joseph Adams comprised of all the fiction the magazine published during its first year. Wide Open is Deborah Coates's ghostly debut though she has developed a good reputation in the short story market. That one just peeking out is Alex J. Cavanaugh's CassaFire his next action Sci-Fi. Brian Evenson's April release Immobility caught me immediately with its short blurb:
I also attached some solid metal castor wheels (as I had always originally intended). Along with the advantage of mobility the wheels also add enough height to give the cabinet perfect proportions for a coffee or deep side table.
A Cast Rite box truck is on the road the same time as I travel by car to walk. Cast Rite Metal is located in Birdsboro, from what my reading of the lettering on the vehicle tells me.
“My goal was to capture voices of all ages. I met a woman who'd been in one of Bob Hope's overseas Christmas shows and a man from Australia, who told me about going to the beach on Christmas day. I heard the story of a soldier in the middle of the Mekong Delta whose most poignant memory was of a helicopter blaring "Jingle Bell Rock" through the fury of a Christmas Eve firefight. I collected memories.”
This film truly has it all, and yet, I know many of you will say that it is not truly an Action-Comedy. To this I might have to agree as the film takes place in a Renaissance-era setting and therefore lacks the necessary explosions, car chases, and witty one-liners that abound in the Action-Comedy genre. Indeed, The Princess Bride would more appropriately fall under the Adventure-Romance-Comedy kind of flick. However this film is so damn funny and packed full of action. If you don't believe me, watch these two clips. The first is an epic sword duel between the Dread Pirate Roberts, played by Cary Elwes, and the Spaniard Inigo Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. And the second is a mash-up of Wallace Shawn as the evil Sicilian genuis, Vizzzini uttering his favorite catchphrase: inconceivable!

The government have the means to protect our borders as they police Iraq and Afghanistan. But they don’t want to. The media covers by telling us that the politicians have lost control of the orders. No, they have not. They want immigrants to flood in, which is why they advertise for them to come here in our overseas embassies. It is why the British Council trains young Africans in our ways and uproots them from their own villages and communities.
Now we’re back, we’re doing some more preparation for the baby. Ordered a few more items, and have begun to narrow down the list of baby names. I’ve also done a bit more sewing, and made two very cute hooded bath towels yesterday. I’ll post a pic of those once they’ve been washed.

Lots of dark dreary clouds rolled in on Friday and we had a brilliant downpour of rain which fell a little short of an inch of rain ... around 17 mm ... but was most welcome. While we are certainly at the beginning our 'dry' season here in the northern tropics, an April shower is not totally uncommon. It does happen, but it's not all that commonplace. In fact, the rain that fell on Friday was the only rain that's fallen all this month.
The ornate book plate is a Tim Holtz and the flowers were cut from colour core card with the PaperArtsy grunge flowers #2 and #3. One of the flowers was covered in music tissue tape. The pin was from Creative expressions and the centre of the flowers had ranger broken china stickles and a pearl sticky. The final flower was made by winding round some cotton lace/ braid and sewing a couple of stitches across the bottom. I think the "life is beautiful" stamp is from Stampin up.
We enjoyed looking at the Garden, but decided that all of that grass would be a bit too high maintenance for us ;o) I prefered the more natural looking areas with lots of plants, trees and, hopefully, wildlife. How on earth do they mow that mound?! The version at National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh is perfect, though, - just right for the setting.

The flower was coloured with my aquapainter and inks and I love the delicate look it gives. Naturals Ivory takes the ink beautifully but you may need to pop the card under a pile of magazines for a little while if the card stock warps slightly with the water. When the ink was dry, I used a marker to add the yellow stamens that characterise these gorgeous wild roses.
I am definitely impressed with the standard of the music coming out of Germany as it seems to have more passion and life than music we get within the United Kingdom and United States.

Back in my youthful days when I spent my weekends at the roller rink, going backwards was "totally rad." Heck you were even still considered cool if you could move backwards using the awkward Figure 8 motion, instead of the more sophisticated method of whipping one foot behind the other.

Well, luckily I sat next to a wonderful woman. This past week the woman (Toni who is originally from Zimbabwe emailed me). Seriously, she made the flight go as fast as it could go. .. considering I almost knocked her head off when trying to hold little A and get a suitcase (monster carryon--yes, I griped in the past about people who packed like that, but I could only take four HUGE containers back with me) out from an overhead bin. I did have to smile when she emailed to see if Little A would still, "only let his mom hold him". ;-) When Big A jumped a ride on the escalator in Washington D.C., she was the one to materialize at the bottom and yank him off. What is more amazing? She saw us get on and actually switched with someone to sit with the two of us to help.

Until recently it was believed that no recordings of this groundbreaking TV series existed, but recently a copy of the first episode came into my hands. I was particularly happy to see it because my father, Ken Sobol, was one of the hosts of Media Circus, along with Shelden Greenberg and David Hamblyn.
sometimes, i still feel it. apologetic. or even, dare i say, embarrassed, to knit in public (i should say this in response to perhaps making someone else feel uncomfortable). i've knit my way around the world (taking these feelings and wool, with me) and i've had various reactions to it, from delight, to disdain. the thing is, i'm not sure it's changed that much. i'm wondering what your feelings are? am i making too much of this book? do you sometimes feel uneasy while knitting outside your home, or feel you make others uncomfortable by doing so? and non-knitters, your feelings too? i know i'm biased, i think it's a beautiful craft, one of the arts. i've lately wished there were such a thing as yarn along town.

Your Values will guide you through life. (Consider it to be your Map) You will consult your Values when making tough decisions. Values are your compass. They will point you to the true north. Sticking to your Values does not mean things will be easier. There are some situations that will be made more difficult if you stick to your Core Values. But doing the right thing is not always doing the easiest thing is it? Values are not flexible. You do not follow them sometimes and forget them other times when it is inconvenient.
It's a ten. For sure. I'm very proud of it.
3: SHIRLEY & LEE - The Real Thing
The topic came up as the small group of guys I’m discipling was discussing the final chapters of the book we’ve been reading together: The Masculine Mandate: God’s Calling to Men, by Richard Phillips (my review). While the entire book speaks generally of God’s calling to all men, the penultimate chapter looks more specifically at discerning spiritual gifts for the purpose of serving the church. I really liked this quote:

Also! I found this really awesome goblet today, it’s perfect for some Ritualist in LARP, I wanted to have it right when I saw it. It’s a black goblet with three faces on it, one young woman’s one, one not-so-young woman’s one and an old woman’s one. Apparently it’s a Wiccan’s thing, but I just liked the idea of it, felt like sharing it with you:
If you visited here before, you know I can be a pretty selfish seamstress. I have, in the past, the very distant past, made clothes for my girls, but their level of enthusiasm didn't match my degree of effort, so I searched for a more appreciative clientele. And, where did I find said clientele. Well, she stared back at me every morning when I brushed my teeth.

Even atheists have Nature, all-powerful, destructive as a hurricane, gentle as a mother robin. Evolution is the plodding agent of Her will. Evolution holds the master plan that used to be the prerogative of Zeus and Jehovah, executing it through Natural Selection in an infinitely complex way over unimaginably long stretches of time. There’s a whimsical, perverse aspect to Evolution, a God with the most serious intentions who chooses merely to start the ball rolling and then sits back for billions of years to see how things pan out….

The age of communication, Internet, Media is moving so fast that trends, culture and we as human beings have completely transformed ourselves in past few decades. We are able to perceive generation gap within 1-2 years. We have gone from studying computers to studying from computers. From wanting to communicate to wanting to hide. The changes are just so many and they are at all the levels. For people who were born before 1970 the changes are much more difficult and visible. But the interesting part is that for kids born in this century, change is part of life.

I panicked a little about whether or not the frogs might be poisonous. Then he said this all took place two days before. Since no one died (aside from the frogs) I guess that rules out poison. So good to know.
Now that the highway between the voice of God and the heart of man has been compromised, we're left a little dazed and confused. The blinding light of, 'Whoa! I'm a self!' and 'Dude, life is, like, dangerous,' has left us staggering about for sources of income, shelter, mates, someone who knows how to give a decent haircut and the desire to secure the best possible option in each scenario. Fly in the ointment, though, is that we're prone to error. Sometimes, we take the wrong job, or decline the right one. Sometimes we fall in love with someone who makes a root canal seem like a twinkly ride on a yacht under a pink sugar moon. Sometimes what is disguised as a 'house' is actually a money pit.

I was feeling really good through the first six miles. My stomach had evened out, we were holding a good pace, really it was shaping up to be a good run. The all of a sudden the 1:55 pacer flew by us. It definitely surprised me a bit, not because I felt like I would be able to stay ahead of her, but for the longest time she was a good distance back. I knew if I wanted to stay under two hours I couldn't really slow down. Shortly after that was when we started in on the hills. Again, nothing major, but enough to make the pace a little tougher to hold.

Donatich defended his position on the printed book and examined a few of its appealing qualities. In the article’s first paragraph, he said, “You might see us in raptures over the grain of paper, the pacing of illustrations, the complement of typeface and design. We will bore you with the sensual pleasure of the book: its smell and feel, the way in which a fine book ages” (Donatich 329).
So off we went to the Nicolsons run Old Watling. This is a good pub and offered two light beers, though the Roosters True Grit went off as I ordered it. Our second choice of Jaipur was, well, just like Jaipur is these days. Below ordinary, but fortunately a new Roosters came on and was decent enough. Next up was the Cockpit and another pub that I liked. Absolutely crowded, but we found a corner to stand in the bottom of the pub. Beside us, a young couple sat on bench seats, spread out so that a space that would have fitted four or five, was theirs alone. Her coat and handbag took up two spaces and he took up the rest. I sipped my Adnams and observed. She read the Evening Standard, he was texting like mad. They didn't speak and their glasses were empty. After a while the girl glanced up and looked at us. She asked if we'd like to squeeze in. He didn't make any move or even look at us, so we declined. About 20 minutes later they left.
Gulf Brew is the annual beer tasting event held in downtown Lafayette that raises money for the Acadian Center for the Arts.

Perhaps I’m feeling reflective since I am five days away from walking in my own graduation ceremony. Yes, indeed. Five days. Kinda freaky if you ask me. Five years have gone by in the snap of my fingers. Seriously, it feels like it has gone by like a breeze, and I’m feeling appreciative of all the people I have met in those years. Whether they stayed my friend for years to follow, or if they were a buddy when we were in class together, if we dated or if we merely flirted, or if we made out like mad at that one party back in my sophomore year…however I met you, I’m thankful for knowing all these people.

I spent my long weekend catching up with my old friends zubrowka and piwo.. and a few other people. Ate all my favourite foods, went to my favourite places, and caught up with some of my favourite people. When I left Poland in June I had no idea when I'd go back and see everyone, but leaving this time was easier knowing it really isn't over. Being there too reminded me to keep on top of my Polish at home, after just a short time it's already degraded quite a lot, so must get on it and stop being so leniwa!

We then celebrated the end of '07 by popping the first Show your Hoppeeness IIPA. I must say that we did a pretty damn good job. Bitter with tons of hop flavor and aroma, with a surprisingly full body and just a hint of resiny sweetness. We may actually be learning after all.

The complex of Santa Maria Novella also includes three cloisters, open to the public as museum. The Chiostro Verde (Green cloister), is the best known and it is truly picturesque with its cypress-surrounded fountain. It is named for the greenish tint in the pigment used by Paolo Uccello in his frescoes, of which the most celebrated is the dramatic Diluvio Universale (The Flood) .
even a young child knows sweetly and innately to long to be in the presence of their parent...they desire and ache for you when you are away...are we that way with our heavenly Father? do we know him enough, have we spent enough sweet time with him to know what it is to miss him if we stray?
Sweet with just a hint of an edge, The Selection is a puzzle that initially feels familiar, the individual pieces all ones we’ve seen before in other stories, but yet Ms. Cass manages to guide our hands through a beautifully and artfully executed assembly where the familiarity quickly fades to a non-issue in the face a truly enjoyable tale. While there is certainly a level of predictability stemming from the presence of the aforementioned easily recognizable plot elements, Ms. Cass quickly reminds us why such elements are so popular, drawing us swiftly into America’s tale when a forbidden love is immediately put to the test as circumstance, opportunity, and pride force the taking of irreversible first steps toward a new fate.
So this the deal with ya
But there’s hope! Your spouse doesn’t have to deposit into your love bank for you to be able to love them with your whole heart. Pastor Kevin D. Young speaks of “Spirit-Powered, Gospel-Driven, Faith-Fueled Effort.” And I can’t think of a place where it is more necessary than in marriage.
And second, the definition of “choice” in this public dialogue seems quite limited. Yes, there are those who do or don’t have the liberty of choosing whether or not to work inside or away from the home. But I think we often overlook what the work itself means to us. I am grateful to do work that I love. I feel for my friends who feel stuck in a job, sometimes a life’s career, that they perceive as pure drudgery. They count down the hours until the workday ends and the years until the work ends altogether–they retire from a company or their children head off to fend for themselves.

Penguin is learning about the silent "e" at the end of words that make the vowel says its name. She's doing splendidly with it. Whenever the book adds an "s" onto the end of a word she squeals, "They're trying to trick me!" When she reads the words correctly she exclaims that she is so much smarter than the book because it can't trick her. It's pretty cute.
Of course, the intrinsic link to dreams makes it all the more fascinating. Dreams can be serene or scary, or to borrow Evelyn Waugh’s title, 'Beautiful and Damned'. But no matter what happens – whether we miss trains (my recurring theme), find ourselves inexplicably back at school with exams that have not been prepared for, or with marshmallows glued all over a favourite pair of shoes (yes, that was a recent dream – try analysing that) – we can always wake up again.

I've been pre-occupying myself in the last week or so with beer. Nothing new there, other than I've not been drinking the stuff. Instead, I've been reading about it. It's science and history, the brewing processes involved, the culture and customs and much more beside.

This has been a problem for sometime now. There’s been lots of warnings, lots of punishments, lots of talks about making good choices, in fact Saturday was the last day of her early nights that she’d been given for the very same reason. There was nothing more for it, she clearly needed a stronger message. We grounded her for 1 week. Not being allowed out to party with your friends at age 6 is inconsequential, so for now, being grounded means a complete lack of privileges and treats, we’ve also swapped the bunks about and she is now on the bottom bunk. Once we awarded her with her punishment she was told that we expected her to think about her behaviour and come to us with a proper apology.

Art in some form, has always been part of my life. I love teaching and have taught everything from faux finishing to polymer clay. I've been fortunate enough to have been published 8 times in Stampington & Co. magazines and have been on TV representing Home Depot and the South Florida Home show with Sherwin Williams Paint Co. I have worked in many art mediums. Eventually boredom drives me away. However visual journaling has remained constant for as long as I can remember. To me, art makes me laugh, gives me a reason to get up and get going, and many

President Moncef Marzouki visited El Ghriba synagogue at Passover – which this year also marked the tenth anniversary of an al-Qaida-related attack that killed 21 European tourists. Wearing a traditional Tunisian hat known as a kabbus, often used by Jewish men in Tunisia as a religious head covering, Marzouki emphasised that Tunisian Jews are an integral part of Tunisian society and "any vandalism or violence against the Tunisian Jewish people, their property or their holy sites is totally unacceptable".

It’s 15 minutes to close. And a family of three walk in the door. Everyone else is busy, so I have to deal with them. The lady (an established client, of course) says they don’t know if they should bring in their kitty. This client notoriously has no money, and waits too long to bring pets in, so when she does it’s a train wreck. I ask her what is going on. She says some stuff, and finishes with the cat hasn’t been eating. I ask how long. Two weeks. I ask if it’s eating at all. No. How long? 4 days. *ugh*. I tell her we need to see her cat right away, and she starts saying how the cat is fine, blah blah. So I’m explaining that cats NEED to eat or they can start having liver trouble. The gal is still arguing that the cat seems OK to her. I finally convince the owner to make an appointment, if she won’t take the cat to emergency.
This June my big boy turned 7!! We didn't do a big party or anything this year, he was happy with low key. He was so happy to go visiting family, that was his birthday celebration! He was excited to get some Phineas and Ferb toys from Nana as that is his current cartoon obsession.
Finding the history of the 100 Grand bar was a challenge. There were many stories about people suing radio stations for giveaways where they got the candy but not the money that they thought they'd get, but not a lot of facts. I believe the bar was first called the $100,000 bar in 1966 but the name as changed to what we know now in the 1980s. This comes in two pieces though the entire pack is one serving size just like the Oh Henry! also from Nestlé. Unlike it's sister bar Crunch this has more added sugars and a sweeter scent. The inside is very soft which the crispy rice is in the top coating only. What this does is let more of the chocolaty flavor (courtesy of cocoa butter and chocolate) out because there is simply more material that is chocolate here. This is necessary candy to include in this collection for this fact.
I hope you guys will have a nice weekend.
I started Crossfit back in 2009, almost exactly two months before I married Husband. This was thanks to my friend Cindy, one of my bridesmaids, whom I blame (in a positive way) for getting me started on this whole Crossfit journey. We were flying back to California from Arizona post my bachelorette weekend, and we were talking about how we had each heard of Crossfit from other people in our lives. She wanted to change up her fitness regimen, I wanted to feel strong mentally and physically heading into the wedding … and two days later, she called me to tell me that there were three possible Crossfit boxes in our area and which one would be my first choice location-wise. That was the beginning.

In any other sport these men would have the Lakers, Cowboys, Yankees, and other top teams bidding wildly for their services. When Mo Greene retired you would have thought that sprinters with the talent of Wallace Spearmon, Xavier Carter, Darvis Patton, Mike Rodgers, and Ivory Williams would be lined up doing what Mo Greene did in 1996 - asking Smith to teach him how to be a champion. I mean, wouldn't YOU take a chance on the coach of champions such as Steve Lewis (Olympic gold and silver), Quincy Watts (Olympic gold), and Mo Greene (Olympic gold and bronze, along with four World gold)? Yet, since Greene's retirement the top male sprinters have chosen to go elsewhere to learn their craft - only in track and field. Yet if there's any question that Smith still has "it" look no further than Carmelita Jeter who took advantage of that "opening" and this season became #2 all time in the women's 100!

At the end of March 1995 a friend of ours told us about a stray dog hanging around where he worked. She was a pit bull, and she seemed friendly; he was worried what might happen to her and he knew that we loved pitties. The Big Guy and I decided to go have a look at her — but I insisted we bring Buster along. If Buster didn’t like her, that would be that.

First, most Bay Area citizens don’t seem to understand that this is NOT the way it is in all major cities; other places simply do not have the same numbers of homeless roaming the streets. But because SF citizens seem to think that this is just the way it is everywhere and because there doesn’t seem to be any diversity of political thought, their solution is “more of the same,” which is to throw more money at social services and give the underbelly a dollar or two when walking by. I find it sadly amusing that the same people who will accuse Bush of intractability can have this same “stay the course” mentality in the face of abject failure.

Thus ends the tale of our Easter bunnies. My family of three left that evening to return to our beds at home, and we were so exhausted that our Easter was spent doing absolutely nothing but being together. I did miss going to church, dressing in the set-apart designated Easter outfit, and celebrating with others while singing the beloved Easter songs; however, Easter isn't just one day a year. Celebrate the hope of Easter every day, and remember the Cross.

Second, make the curriculum as narrow, rote, and regimented as you can. This makes it possible for low-skilled “teachers” to “teach.” All they need do is maintain order while drilling students in mindless memorization and robotic repetition. By all means avoid messy things like context, nuance, values, complexity, reflection, depth, ambiguity—all the things that actually make for true intelligence. It’s too hard to teach those things and, besides, you need intelligent, experienced people to be able to do it. Stick with the model: Profitable equals simplistic and formulaic. Go with it.

In part two of the full DVD, he critiques various disciplines, both mystical and psychotherapeutic, which are said to lead to states of enlightenment. He proposes that states of enlightenment, if they are to be attained, must be gained in spite of–not because of–meditation, devotion, prayer, acceptance, forgiveness, or compassion. Stripped of all our pretenses, facing the despair of the human condition, freed of the imaginary diseases from which “enlightenment” may save us, we can build realistic and practical lives.

If you've got a handed-down love for a type of food, then it might just be your duty to make everyone else around you love it as well. It started out pretty well for us: my aunt Mimi, not a huge fan of chestnuts, made her own candied chestnuts this year. Then again, that might have something to do with the fact that she's my Maman's sister. I suspect a hidden appreciation for chestnuts somewhere.

It’s also lucky for Ben that Ollie’s the kind of guy that sees beyond the bloated stomach and the catheter tube and the awkwardness that has kept Ben from living out loud for so long.

Even though poor black South Africans under the Black ANC government have (a) lower per capita income and educational levels than they did under the white apartheid government; (b) lower life expectancy than they did under apartheid goverment, and (c) higher infant mortality than they did under apartheid government, (d) have to compete with currently anything from 3 to six million African immigrants for jobs, and accordingly have massively higher unemployment rates, and poverty than during apartheid; Nelson Mandela has not considered such a massive reduction in their socio-economic status important enough to even launch a public debate ‘liberation struggle’ against the oppressive ANC black elite government of domination by a corrupt elite.

* While the journal's current panel of peer reviewers works hard to assess the legal content of articles submitted for review, they sometimes lack a sufficient degree of appreciation of the relevant legal and commercial culture which would enable them with confidence to recommend publication, amendment or rejection of submissions.JIPLP is always willing to enlarge its panel of peer reviewers. While the task of review is unpaid and sometimes onerous, it can be rewarding too, when a referee's helpful guidance and suggestions shapes an unpublishable manuscript into a publishable form or turns a good article into an excellent one.
Oh, and lest I forget to mention, the PIG PAC isn’t all that it claims to be. Just yesterday (May 1, 2012) the new LEED-IE PAC ad on page A8 of the Herald lists the citizens that reportedly support their candidates and who oppose the other candidates. Trouble is, that’s a false claim. Several of those listed have already denounced the ad on facebook and insisted they were misled about the ad and the candidates they reportedly were supporting. One such individual contacted the Herald directly and asked to have his family’s names removed from the list. Another is drafting a letter to the editor denouncing the ad and the use of his name. Several prominent personalities in the community have complained that Paul Gay is duping people so he can add their names to the list. Interesting isn’t it that the guy with a CLEAR conflict of interest (being the sole source for providing insurance and benefits for all public school employees) is the ringleader calling around to sign people up for the PIG PAC? Paul Gay and Lynn Smith and a number of other dishonest officials doing these calls should be ashamed of their misrepresentations. They are not worthy of serving on the BOE or receiving future contracts with the school system.

If we hadnt stopped for a bathroom break (the part after the break has some really long stop lights to wait for) we would have made it back in 2 hours. That is like a 20 minute mile which is pretty darn good. But we had to stop and they didn't have many bathrooms open - but we didnt realize they had another bathroom stop shortly after that. After that point it felt like we were at the back of the whole walk - but turns out we weren't.
We ran up and down the halls looking inside each door. “He’s not in D12!” “D15 is clear!” We looked for the stairs thinking we must be on the wrong floor. We knew he was headed to the roof so we climbed to the next level of the apartment building. Opening the door to the next floor we stumbled into ‘them’, they were after Chad. Hoping ‘they’ didn’t see us we ran as fast as we could back down the stairs and tried to hide in a storage closet, but it was too late. ‘They’ grabbed me by the arm and took me back to the stairs. “We don’t need you getting in our way Missy!” ‘they’ yelled while pushing me down to the next level.

Though I was tempted to wallow in oyster-hate for as long as I could bear it, I have very little resolve when it comes to things that aren’t fun, so that only lasted a few weeks. Then it was time to “figure things out” (I use the phrase loosely because I’m fairly certain I will never be able to use it tightly). So I considered my options–at first they had all seemed equally terrible and then, around the new year, they all seemed equally tolerable, which only made decision-making that much harder–and explored as many as I could.

I highly recommend anyone visiting Ho Chi Minh City to visit Reunification Palace if you were to pick one or a few places to visit in the city. The whole palace is preserved as it was during the war. It is a quite different way to learn about one aspect of the Vietnam War history.

In the first year of POD, Self-Publishing & Independent I began writing a series of long articles, using the quote or alternative of it - Publish or Be Damned - originally a quote attributed to Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, when the courtesan Harriette Wilson threatened to publish her memoirs and his letters. I tweaked the quote as Publish or Be Damned, in deference to the plight of self-published authors, frustrated with the difficulties of being published, and the fact that ultimately if they did not persevere and follow their calling, the worse damning voice would be their own and not their detractors. I suppose it was the clarion call of frustrated authors saying; 'to hell with it, I'm going to do it.'

This was my impulse buy – I couldn’t put it down. I mean, to think, 200 years ago Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm compiled all of the popular fairy and folk tales of their day into one of the most famous compilations of all time. And they still hold up.

It was an adventure because it was raining, but I had the store in mind that I knew would sell cards. However because I couldn´t remember exactly where I had seen it, I got off at the wrong metro stop. On top of that it was rainy and FREEZING. I wandered around downtown for a while, found a book store, and a pretty awesome church, both of which will be visited again sometime in the near future, preferably on a less rainy day. I got back on the metro, and got off on my stop for the uni (uni = university. now and forevermore) because I had class in 1 hour, went to a store that looked like it might sell cards, but they didn´t so the guy directed me to a bookstore (una libreria :D) that would sell them. I went there, looked around and found language guides I thought would be useful (Russian..mainly so I can still practice but with Spanish as a reference point (!!!), German -for Austria :D (and Germany); Italian -for Italy, duh. haha, and in case I can´t remember something after what, a year of not taking Italian, and Portuguese. :D)

Oh, damn. There goes the ** again. Okay, full disclosure. I missed one thing on my bucket list. I thought I wanted to go snorkeling when I was Hawaii. Let’s just say I slightly underestimated how cold the water would be in January. While it was warm enough for a quick swim, it never felt quite warm enough to go snorkeling for an extended period of time.
Scripture also warns us that people will listen to their false teaching:
Or, do they roll their eyes from the time the speeding kids took out our brick mailbox with Grandma's Cadillac--nah--that became a dot on the bridge for a few weeks later a car went airborne into the house on the huge hill at the end of the cove. No joke. The car crashed through the window, the dining room, and stopped on the back wall of the kitchen, where two drugged out teens stepped out unscathed and said, "Whoa!" Ironically, there were no tire marks on the grass.
Digression! But back to Fishing. For some reason, Fishing can be maxed out even with my lowly level of 64 (out of 85). So I’ve been fishing…in areas of the world that I have no business being in. Areas where I get one-shotted if anything even remotely sees me. I was sneaky last night and found a nice, quiet secluded beach to fish at, where I finally attained my 525/525 Fishing stat and got my achievement fix. Hooray.

I don't think it would be possible for anyone to walk in and drag off any of the bombs that are still scattered about. They are way too heavy for anyone to manage on their own. My concern is that they might be sabotaged in some way or that they could detonate somehow by accident. I hope they clean up this site soon. Everyday I drive down that road and I say a few prayers.
I slept all day Saturday and on Sunday I woke up thinking, “shit, did I really feel that bad because of caffeine?” It made me think about cutting back on the coffee, which would normally seem absurd, but now I think it just isn’t worth the withdrawal.
During discussions to review patent infringement remedies, US industry was increasingly divided in their views with respect to a grant of injunction and adequate damages to compensate infringement. With the development of case law to resolve the different views (see eBay Inc. v MercExchange, LLC, 126 S. Ct. 1837, 164 L. Ed. 2d 641, USPQ2d 1577 (US 2006), Lucent Techs. v Gateway, Inc., 580 F.3d 1301, 92 USPQ2d 1555 (Fed. Cir. 2009), the industry was finally able to reach an agreement for all controversial issues in patent reform and convince Congress to pass a reform bill (see HR 1249 (AIA), 112th Congress: 2011–2012 (here)). However, the terms of America Invents Act represent a lot of compromises between competing interests of different sectors of US industry, including large multinational firms, universities, and non-profit research labs and independent inventors, which will lead to a lot of uncertainty for US courts and the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as to how to interpret these terms.

Alvarez agrees, saying, “My major concern is that this effort to get that spent fuel out of there is not something you should be doing casually and taking your time on.”
Don’t ever give up. In Proverbs 2:6-8 it says, “God gives out wisdom free, its plainspoken in knowledge and understanding. He’s a rich mine of common sense for those who live well, a personal bodyguard to the candid and sincere. He keeps his eye on all who live honestly, and pays special attention to his loyal committed ones.”
The AMG division is all about the engine and mechanical engineering. Release the catch, raise the bonnet and marvel at the hand-assembled 6.2-litre V8 engine underneath. It’s time for some figures, starting with power output. 336kW and 600Nm are not exactly shy, are they? Coupled with the 7-Speed gearbox with paddles behind the steering wheel, this C63 is ferocious from the get go. The benchmark 0-100km/h sprint is eaten up in a staggering 4.4 seconds and it’ll carry on until it reaches a limited 250km/h. It has a great party trick too. Start the car up in the normal manner, but as you turn the key to start the ignition, give the accelerator pedal a nice hard jab. The resulting backfire and roar from the exhaust is ridiculously loud and extremely satisfying.
Four for four.
Treasonous spies operating within Governments and intelligence agencies resulting in murder of other loyal spies is a fact of history.

Grayson embraced her, holding her in an overblown display of emotion. He heaved a great sorrowful sigh, and she stepped back, grasping his arms to study his face in earnest. Grayson looked back and forth between them to let the tension build.
Within the few months the city ran out of food. Grocery stores were robbed of the last supplies of goods, and people’s personal supplies were not enough to sustain regular meal patterns. People began to empty out their fridges and freezers because all the food began to rot. The smell of roasted meat briefly permeated the air as Sarajevan’s were forced to use up all of the previously stored food. Neighbors shared copious amounts of meat, milk and eggs so that they would not be wasted. Olja,Adisa, Vedran and I , friends from kindergarten, sat and shared our knowledge of starvation picked up in numerous WWII movies.

The value of a service dog is that they give people freedom to live their lives more independently, and that value is priceless. As Austin is a very dog friendly city, it may be difficult to determine whether or not a dog is only a companion dog or a service dog. Here's a friendly guide for restaurants on some challenges and etiquette when serving a guest with a service dog. Please see Keep Austin Dog Friendly for etiquette that companion dog owners should follow when dining out with their dogs.

Our new friends, Bill and I can't remember her name but she looked like that chick from Dynasty who was hooked up with Yanni, could not wait to tell us that they had seen Sarah Jarosz play at the Telluride Bluegrass Festival. Which, you know, yay for you, bet that was quite a show, small talk small talk small talk please let me drink my wine now. But then, once the show started, every time they began a new song, one of them would lean over to the other and say something about fucking Telluride. Then they would begin a competition to see how many times they could say "Telluride" in the course of each song. So throughout the performance, one I had been breathlessly anticipating for months, I would hear: "mumblemumblemumbleTELLURIDEmumblemumblemumbleTELLURIDE." This is what I imagined they were saying:

I felt a bit sad for my pots though, hopefully they'll be ok there now. I still however failed to get a photo of the dress or in fact of anything that was in the show at all, too busy nattering.

Instead of trying to repeat myself the thirteenth time, I grabbed him by the hair and banged his head into the page twelve times in the hope that some of it would seep through his skull. The boys head passed the halfway point and reached the page a dozen times with force. Before Newton, this is how Zeno’s paradoxes were solved. Zeno’s Arrow Paradox was solved by men shooting arrows into other men. Even the indisputable logic of Greeks could not argue with a shaft in the torso. No matter what the arrows did at finite points of stopped time, no matter how still they were, they always found themselves in the spleens of other men.

Still going to the doctor every week for close monitoring. We're now getting an awesome test done each week that detects a certain protein that is predictive of pre-term labor. It's pretty accurate, it can tell whether you're at risk in the next two weeks. But, since everything looked great with me, my doc decided not to send the test off for results. Hoping this becomes the trend :)

Now I'm sitting on my makeshift bed staying up way too late on my last night in America for a little while. I'm bopping across a few oceans to spend just over a month back at Visthar. Obviously this reality has yet to hit me. I mean... yeah. I don't even know what to say. I get to go back to Visthar. After 30-something taxing hours of traveling alone (and those who know me know how I LOOOVE to fly...) I will once again be able to step onto the ground of beloved Visthar. I am so incredibly happy, but I also feel unworthy of this privilege. There are so many who have gone before and after me who would kill to get to go back to that oasis, so I feel like I don't deserve to be that person. However, I guess the best I can do is try to make something of this opportunity. I hope I can do that. (P.S. SJPD 09, I will be thinking of you all. How could I not be?)

Physician Assistant’s (PA) are licensed in the U.S. to assist in the practice of medicine under the direction of a physician. Entry-level education is a Bachelor’s degree. They are licensed through a national certifying exam and accredited by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant. They can perform examinations, diagnosis, treatments, and have prescriptive authority. To maintain their licenses, PA’s must undergo 100 hours of continuing education every two years, and recertify by exam every six years. To maintain their licenses, PA’s must undergo 100 hours of continuing education every two years and recertify, by exam, every six. While they work in association with physicians, they are not independent practitioners. Unlike physicians, PA’s cannot specialize and have no specialty boards. They work alongside MD’s in an autonomous relationship, which includes ordering tests, interpreting tests, and prescribing. They can staff clinics, assist in surgery, and work on call for the practice. PA’s can treat most primary care illnesses on their own, which means that they are responsible for the diagnosis and treatment options, they also do perform follow up examinations when necessary.

I mean, I never even thought of that. I wasn’t as deeply into physics games then (if that’s an excuse), so naturally I didn’t think of a different angle. But instantly that one outside my box perception opened everything up for me. My hero was now vulnerable. He’s wrestling with what he was, what he’s become, what he can’t change, and where this irrevocable transformation must lead, even as he’s bent on a warpath of revenge. And then the heroine pops up to derail all those plans …

Personally, I would have to agree with Zab Judah. At this point Devon Alexander has a lot to prove, and if he just so happens to get warn down by this strong fisted, pressure fighter, he maybe finding himself on ESPN Friday Night Fights. Because I think it would greatly derail his career. After one poor performance against Kotlenik, a loss to Bradley, and a potential loss to a Matthysee, I have my doubts HBO would still have interest in Alexander. At 24 years of age, I don't think Devon Alexander would have a fun time climbing back up the ladder. I have to question who is advising him to take this fight.
This just made him more fun to challenge.

On the other side of the coin is Atheism. I like to think that I’m a pretty rational person. I believe in science and I’ve heard many good cases against the existence of a God as well. Science is wonderful and it’s useful. It’s important to understanding ourselves and the world around us. There is so much beauty in the understanding and complexities in our world that it is almost religious in it’s extreme awe and wonder. I am positively astounded by the facts as giant as space down to something as incredible as the atom. And how they all come together to create this existence we call life. I can fully understand why people believe that there is no god and how we are nothing but a part of this swirling blue ball because of almost being ‘in the right place at the right time’.

Underneath the quieter façade, he’s the one with the confidence. He has a smile that will light up a room. He’s kind, loves animals, and is considerate. It’s a rare quality in one so young. Perhaps it’s my illness that has made him that way. And he has his own health issues to contend with. They think he may be showing signs of developing my Behcets disease. The tests have started. Only time will tell. When he has flare ups we lose our little ray of sunshine for a few days/weeks. His effervescence flattens like a bottle of pop left with the lid off.

From the sketch you can see that I used brads as an accent. While making my actual card an idea popped into my head that I should try using the Beautiful Wings embosslit so I used the little butterflies instead of brads. I added some sparkle to my butterflies and to the dots on the olive circle because I just can't make a card without adding some sort of sparkle or shimmer. The ribbon was layered because I didn't like the look of either of these alone. Don't you like the layered ribbon better?

June:Deputy Secretary of Treasury Samuel Bodman spotlights the risk posed by the GSEs and called for reform, saying “We do not have a world-class system of supervision of the housing government sponsored enterprises (GSEs), even though the importance of the housing financial system that the GSEs serve demands the best in supervision to ensure the long-term vitality of that system. Therefore, the Administration has called for a new, first class, regulatory supervisor for the three housing GSEs: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banking System.” (Samuel Bodman, House Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Testimony, 6/16/04)

A recent “tax the rich” scheme is the Buffett rule, which is a proposal to raise taxes on individuals who earn more than $1 million per year in income. Warren Buffett, the man who proposed it, devised his “rule” after observing that he paid a lower percentage of income taxes (19%) on his $48.1 million income in 2006 than his employees who earn less. That may sound like a wonderful and altruistic idea until one considers that Buffett’s wealth has been between about $37-62 billion in recent years. (To be fair to Buffett, he does contribute a significant portion of his money to charity, much like conservatives who donate more to charity than modern liberals — despite the fact that liberals have slightly higher incomes on average.) If Buffett really wanted to pay higher taxes to contribute more to the U.S. federal government (besides voluntarily sending a check to the U.S. Treasury) he’d propose a wealth tax: if he paid 19% of his wealth in tax he’d be contributing about $7 billion (using $37 billion as his wealth) in taxes. A wealth tax of just 1% on Buffett would generate $370 million in tax revenues, and a wealth tax of 0.025% would generate the same tax revenue as the 19% income tax rate on his $48.1 million income (about $9 million).
