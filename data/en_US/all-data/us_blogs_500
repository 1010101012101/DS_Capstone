I was intrigued to learn about the process that will be used to select Shenouda's successor. In some ways it's more open and democratic than the system used to choose the Archbishop of Canterbury (though even the Roman conclave is more democratic, if not necessarily more open, than that) but is also satisfyingly weird. The Synod of the Coptic Church (which corresponds to the House of Bishops in the Church of England General Synod) and a body representing the laity both take part in elections to discover three potential candidates. But the final choice is made by a boy who is led blindfold to the altar and invited to pull one of the names out of a hat. Well probably not a hat, but the same principle applies.

Thank you, Mary, for letting me invade your excellent blog today. I am honoured! You said you’d like me to talk about synaesthesia and because there’s so much to say about it, I’ve paired it with Lucy Coats’ blog. So, Part 1 – the facts and how to tell if you have the condition – was there and Part 2 – about what it means for writers – is here.
There are many ways to learn playing poker and build your bankroll. All online poker rooms offer multiple choices for the new players: Freerolls, No Deposit Bonuses, Deposit Bonuses, Rakeback, and other online poker promotions are all common ways to increase your bankroll. But what is the best way to establish your bankroll and become a profitable poker player in the long run?
At the beginning of the semester, we undertook Access to Information requests. An Access to Information request basically gives all Canadian citizens the ability to access information from federal government agencies. Although I had heard of access to information, I never knew what the process was and how to undertake it. The process of undertaking the request and the subsequent action required afterwards were the parts that I found most interesting about the process.
We're not told about what flavour is inside our dessert macarons, but one bite and it's a revelation of blue cheese. The filling has been made from gorgonzola dolce whipped with pepper, salt, a drizzle of honey and a small amount of butter for texture. The shells have been tinted green so beside the chilli pate de fruits they present a festival duo of red and green.
Don’t get confused now, what I’m trying to say is that there’s a zombie-ant fungus and an anti-zombie fungus.

Last note, this is an EXCELLENT way to hide veggies for the kids and adults alike. You can put them in the sauce and just blend it all up. Then add in enough meat and they’ll never know. I tried this on my friend’s 10-year-old son, and it worked like a charm. Also tried it on a guy I dated years ago who claimed to hate veggies. Worked on him too. Gotta love the sneaky.

I worked for hours with the Apps 2 SD program to move everything I could back to the phone from the SD Card and uninstall anything suspicious, but the reboots happened often faster than the actions I was taking. The processors on the phone got so hot, I couldn’t touch the phone from the midway point up. I removed the SD card but that wouldn’t move or uninstall the apps that were causing the problem.
The first call came a couple of days ago.
Thanks for stopping by! Your continued support is my best Christmas gift!!!
Given all of the foregoing, I suggest that even if 1/4 of the population were living and priests or religious, it would be -- far from an economic nighmare -- a stable economic situation and likely one that features a stronger economy than that which we are now "enjoying" in a climate when even among trads the percentage of vocations may be counted on one hand.
Anyway, my point is - you can't control kids and it's probably not a good idea to try. You can however, control yourself, teach your kids, and give them choices and consequences and that, in my opinion, is how you discipline.

Thank you for your suggestions to my previous post! I think I'll do 'a week in the life of an unschooler' type thing, following both Michele and Signe's suggestions (well, not the suggestion to talk about Signe, but the unschooling one ;-) ). But for now, I wanted to share this exert, which I very much like. I've written in the past about how misguided I find the whole "Green Living" thing (you can check out my past posts on it here and here), and since this excert says so simply why I dislike the whole "Green" thing, I figured I'd post it too.
I hope if you like it you will consider leaving a review, and/or a like on Amazon, and maybe even consider buying my other book, "Fractured Facade," which I have discounted to $3.99.

The debate over this issue started with a study published in 1997 by a research team led by Dr. Herman-Giddens. In the study, pediatricians around the country rated sexual maturation in 17,077 girls ages 3 to 12. The study found that breasts or pubic hair, or both, were far more common in 7- and 8-year-olds than medical textbooks had been reporting.

Now, this isn't the first time the evils of artificial sweeteners had crossed my mind. Aspartame has lots of (at least anecdotal) evidence of causing migraines. And back in the fall, I'd given up Diet Coke for a week without seeing any benefits, so I'd ruled that out as a cause. But, as it turns out, I didn't give it long enough. Reading up on the topic, it looks like it takes 30-60 days to get out of your system. Plus, I'd only really given up Diet Coke (both times), but being on a diet, I was consuming TONS of other stuff with different artificial sweeteners in it.
There has been a lot of buzz around the Purdue Baseball program lately. People are starting to figure out that this is a special team. I first noticed the extra attention by the large crowd for the game that never happened Wednesday. This weekend there was a large crowd for all of the games. It is good to see the kids getting some love even though the support could be greater. Today was one of those days that you have in baseball no matter how good you are. Things just don’t always go your way. The hits came at the right time for Michigan State, and our well struck balls went right to someone. All is not lost though. This is still a great team that has a lot of games left ahead of them.

I have recently started interval training. Normally, I'm a long distance meanderer / hiker, and I practice tai chi for hours on end. So the idea of doing short, super high intensity, repetitive bursts using all major muscle groups seems just a touch intimidating, if not downright cray-cray. I am used to having a certain precision control over how I move - that's what tai chi is all about - but in interval training, I'm spazzing all around my living room like someone who's been bitten by a hundred poisonous snakes. I am demonstrating to myself just how limited some of my physical capacities are as I fail to do certain kinds of push-ups (okay, any push-ups) and my legs feel like they're giving out.

My wish for the dance of tango, then, is that the shared intensity returns, in the soul. Not to stay in the surface, but to feel it inside. That the genre evolves from that intimacy. The essence of tango is in the embrace and the person you are dancing with.

Now while I understand that exams are one of the most stressful moments in a young adult’s life, especially at a level where you have been working towards this moment for almost three years, I will never truly comprehend why at the age of 21 we still have such a huge capability to procrastinate. Surely the skill to play with a piece of blue-tac for 45minutes while nothing but the title sits on your screen is nothing but detrimental to the learning process? The desire to do anything but work is a pointless emotion that leads on to strange behaviour and even stranger sleeping patterns. Don’t get me wrong, my clothes have never been cleaner and my room has never been so tidy, but do my DVDs need to be in order of genre and then arranged alphabetically? Never before have I considered sorting my socks into matching pairs in my draw simply to avoid tackling the work’s of Nietzsche. Perhaps this was how Descartes ended up sitting in a room with nothing in it for weeks on end meditating. There is no doubt that had there been a single thread sticking from his jacket, or a dust ball that moved when you blew on it, that his Discourse on Method would never have been written. Now to every first year literature student this does not seem such a bad thing, as without this work The Enlightenment module would be half the length, but to everyone else the concept of missing this great work simply through procrastination seems intolerable.
I have to say that when i figured out poetry was not really my form, it opened the world up. I was less inhibited and clumsy immediately. I don't know why. I felt like someone who had danced ballet realizing they were better at modern dance.. I jumped into flash with glee and haven't been able to leave it.
I can't even explain how I feel. Just purely overwhelmed with gratitude. These ladies took it upon themselves to make Mother's Day special for HUNDREDS of mothers all over the place, by making it possible for total strangers to perform a random act of kindness for someone they have never met but who needed a little extra love, support, and encouragement for whatever reason this particular Mother's Day. My reason, of course, is deployment.

-On 12.14.11 you had a few firsts! It was your first Christmas Cantata at church. You were a huge hit wearing your first pair of shoes (your furry, white boots). Your Grandma and Gee sang in the cantata...you decided you wanted your daddy to walk you around in the back of the church the entire time to make you happy. You also had your first bottle that evening given to you by Daddy! I shed a few tears because it hit me that you could "survive" without me. You were just okay with that bottle...we've switched bottles since and you are great at taking your bottle from Daddy...but you are one messy little eater when you take a bottle! This was also your first day in some cloth diapers.

We went to a nearby college town recently for filming of a kid’s show at a local PBS station. The younger two participated in the craft portion for three different shows. This week’s show features them making a tooth fairy mouse. We all had fun and it was neat to see how many people are involved in the filming of such a show. We’ve been invited back for another filming but I have not decided if we will do it. It is during our spring break week and I was hoping to not have to be anywhere that week so I can get some things done around here and relax.
Few have been raised over his captaincy. He has displayed leadership qualities which suggest this time Arsène may have got it right in handing the armband to the best player in the squad. In the case of Cesc, it was a sop too far for the young man whose temperament on the pitch was impacted by his unsettled personal circumstance. That desire to return home should have precluded the responsibility given to him. In defence of player and club, they had been badly let down by William Gallas and there were few alternatives. A brave decision would have been to give the captaincy to Thomas Vermaelen but it is understandable that the manager wanted someone who understood the ethos of the club and had it ingrained in his character. Even so, it seems that the decision had more to do with keeping him at the club.

Later, after the Spelling kids had grown up and moved out, and Aaron Spelling passed away in 2006, the Widow Spelling put all 56,500 square feet of the Manor up for sale in 2009. Since it was just her, it was really a bit more house than she needed. After more than two years on the market, the UK heiress, Paula Ecclestone, a 22 year former clothing designer, snatched it up. Candy Spelling didn’t get the listed price of $150,000,000. Instead, a deal was struck at the bargain price of $85,000,000 all cash. Why a 22 year old thought she needed a 123 room house is a question for which I’ve no answer.

"Reese was born Delloreese Patricia Early in the historic Black Bottom neighborhood of Detroit, Michigan to African American steelworker Richard Thaddeus Early and Nellie Mitchelle, a Native American (Cherokee) cook. Delloreese's mother also had several older children, before her birth, all of whom did not live with her, hence, she lived as an only child. At only six years old, Reese began singing in church. From this experience, she became an avid gospel singer. As a young lady of the 1940s, on the weekends, she and her mother would go to the movies, independently, to watch the likes of Joan Crawford, Bette Davis and Lena Horne portray glamorous lives on screen. Afterwards, Reese would act out the scenes from every single film. In 1944, she began her career directing the young people's choir, after she had nurtured acting plus her obvious musical talent. She was often chosen, on radio, as a regular singer. At the age of thirteen, she was hired to sing with Mahalia Jackson's gospel group. Delloreese entered Detroit's popular Cass Technical High School (where she attended the same year with an unknown star, Edna Rae Gillooly, later known as Ellen Burstyn). At Cass Tech, she was a brilliant, no-nonsense student. She also continued with her touring with Jackson. With higher grades, she was the first in her family to graduate from high school in 1947, at only 15. Afterwards, she formed her own gospel group, the Meditation Singers. However, due in part to the death of her mother, and her father's serious illness, Reese had to interrupt her schooling at Wayne State University to help support her family. Faithful to the memory of her mother, Deloreese also moved out of her father's house, due to her feuding with her father, who had a new girlfriend. She then took on odd jobs, such as truck driver, dental receptionist, and even elevator operator, after 1949.

I just spent the most wonderful weekend at London Fashion Week, where I saw fascinating shows, scribbled notes to my heart's content and met with good friends as well as interesting new people, all alongside getting rather blinded by camera flashes. I'll be covering much of this in a subsequent post. However, time is short and my teachers at college have decided that I should have no free hours this week, as I have been set several essays. Therefore, I thought it would be an appropriate time to post one of the articles that I submitted for the Vogue Talent Contest - particularly in light of some of the coverage that London Fashion Week and fashion in general recieves in the media. This was the polemic/ opinion piece:

I’ve known Nigel Savage for over twenty years. He is direct and to the point – but I have no hesitation in saying (even though he was a competitor when I was running BPP Law School in the early 1990s) that The College of Law was a bit of a ‘basket case’ before he took over: They lost the support of the Magic Circle firms in the LPC stakes (I know this – I did the report for the Magic Circle firms on the LPC review at the end of the 90s which led to a few changes) and I believe, whatever Savage’s salary, that he has been instrumental in bringing good people in and building up the College of Law’s reputation and range of courses. We have a horrible tendency in this country to build people up and then knock them down. I won’t be part of that thinking. I don’t always agree with Savage’s ideas. I am more than happy to be critical of his views when the need arises – This is what debate is about - but we need a few rough diamonds and people who think out of the box and who do not toe the line. Savage does not toe the line.
He refused. She insisted. He said, “Be careful.”

Methods of in vivo diagnosis and therapy and methods of surgery are also excluded from patentability in Europe. For diagnostic and therapeutic inventions it is normally possible to obtain patent protection using other claim types, such as diagnostic or medical use claims. Medical use claims are directed to use of a therapeutic substance in therapy. European practice allows such claims to be additionally limited in many different ways, for example by patient group, dosages, administration schedules or methods of administration, and so a wide range of inventions can be protected. However there are still problematic areas, such as new medical uses of known devices, particularly where an electrical impulse or electromagnetic radiation is delivered (instead of a substance). Other problematic areas are those where the invention is not restricted to use of a specific therapeutic substance or treatment of a specific condition, such as a new delivery system for example. This is because Examiners are reluctant to allow medical use claims which define substances functionally and which are not limited to treatment of a defined specific disease condition.

When we were checking in they said they needed to see the VISAS of all four of us. They didn’t only need the passports (I had copies of this page), they needed the VISAS as well!!! We didn’t have them. I had left Siena, Lucas and my passports safe at home in Gwalior.
‘Harps’ one could take to mean the time after treatment and before dying, when you are getting on with things in as much as you can: how you can still relate to life, even though life is leaving you. Having seen a recent documentary on the life and death of Irish writer, Nuala O’Faolain (who died very rapidly in 2008 from cancer), I am struck by how Chase really wants to enjoy and not number her final days, as ‘Candour’ shows:
No economic recovery for Greece is envisioned by the European Union plan, but only a bailout of international financial capital and a desperate attempt to stop the crisis from enveloping all of Europe. Some European leaders are calling for debt repayment to be the absolute priority for Greece’s treasury, even before such necessities as wages, healthcare, and food provision. Greeks have been fighting back with general strikes, huge demonstrations in cities all across the country, and occupations, which have moved from Syntagma Square in Athens to neighborhoods. (See “‘We Are All Greeks,’” March-April 2012 N&L.) At the same time, the economic crisis and disintegrative forces in the European Union have created openings for outright fascism. Not only is the neo-Nazi “Golden Dawn” gaining popularity in Greece, the fascist LAOS party was briefly part of the government, and even the Socialist Party is scapegoating immigrants.

PIGLET loves his friends, and his motto is “Even if you are rather small you can still have a very big heart.” Why not paint a Piglet style Easter egg, with huge hearts on it? First, draw seven hearts with a marker, and then use small pieces of sponge with different colors to paint the egg. You can paint the whole egg pale blue like the sky and then paint each of the hearts with one of the colors of the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Piglet would love this Easter egg because it’s small and cute, just like him!

One thing we learn from all this is that the "normalization" of the HM interior was probably not Davis's idea but should be attributed more to the influence of Claude Coats. It is he, after all, who always gets credit for the spooky atmosphere of the first part of the attraction. And much as I'd like to have seen some of these weirder interiors, in the end, what Coats had in mind worked very well indeed. With the Coats approach, the place looks normal enough, if a bit dark and ominous:

So that is what I have planned to start off with for the summer with my kids. They start out each day with a school work assignment and some household chores before they head outside to enjoy the sunshine. Helps them transition back into school a little easier in August too!
The Dene is a fairly narrow and steep sided wooded valley which is worth searching out and investigating. A semi-natural ancient woodland, site of nature conservation interest and proposed local nature reserve, is home to a surprising amount of wildlife and native woodland plants. Split in two by Neptune Road the northern and southern ends of the Dene are totally different.

After coming in from planting two rows of potatoes, 36 soon-to-be-hills of a variety of red and Yukon gold, I had me a little nap and then I started messing around on the computer. Next thing I know, here I am talking about it. Good grief. You'd think I'd have something better to do on a Saturday night. But, I don't. Hey, I have my potatoes planted. There's a super-moon tonight. And all is well with the world. Well, maybe not, but let's pretend, just for tonight, shall we? Even this Linda Pastan poem I found a short while ago seems to fit right into the scheme of things. I've read only a few poems by her thus far, but every one resonates in some fashion.
Dennis Maloney
“The philosophy of our service is that we open a house somewhere and, with the patience of a spider, we lay our web to wait for people to get caught in the web; and we teach those who do. We don’t lay the web to eat or consume them but to show them the way to their resurrection, to blow life into their dead bodies and souls, to give them a life.”

If memory serves, the copy on the back of this jacket was spot on and worthy of an extraordinary book with a great jacket. It helped that it was the author’s own words: “I am here, Master. Command me.” Perfect.

I highly recommend you check it out this weekend. I will always have Pearl Jam's "10" on my list of best albums of all time...but I forgot how really good it was until I saw this film. (Cameron Crow really did an awesome job with this film). And to see everything leading up to the way music changed during that time was like being a part of history you never knew you were part of.
“Oh, sure,” Claypool uttered with a bitter smirk. “The Megellan’s dirty little secret. Don’t wanna tarnish your Roger Ramjet image, do we, Captain?”
(There's also a little noticed rule about the monarch's permission that George III made up for his brothers, but that's hardly worth mentioning)
Sadly (well, for me anyhow) Gray considers Libertarianism to be a utopian creed and I see where he is coming from. As a strand of enlightenment Liberalism, Libertarianism can be conceived of as either radical or progressive - or both - depending on your viewpoint.
As far as vacation bible school...well, I really thought of 9:00 as more of a guideline, if you will - a kind of a ballpark time to shoot for.
“We are challenging Mohamed Razali to repeat what he has stated in the police report so that our legal adviser can take a look into it and for us to seek legal redress,” he told reporters at the party headquarters here on Saturday.
In fact Canadian toryism was in no way socialist in nature; to believe so is to fail to understand the British conservative tradition from which it sprang.
As in cooking, living requires that you taste, taste, taste as you go along--you can't wait until the dish of life is done. In my career, I always looked ahead to the place I wanted to go, the next rung on the ladder. It reminds me of "The Station" by Robert Hastings, a parable read at our wedding. The message is that while on a journey, we are sure the answer lies at the destination. But in reality, there is no station, no "place to arrive once and for all. The joy of life is in the trip, and the station is a dream that constantly outdistances us."
It’s Friday night so I decided since I’m in for the night, I’ll write what I’m feeling. Yesterday was my day to kind of reevaluate my life and what got me here. I cannot blame everything on one person, nor would I ever dream of blaming my faults and shortcomings on him. But after a fifteen minute argument with a mutual friend of the man I use to love, I realize I didn’t change until he changed. I’m not going to mention names so I’ll call him J.A. I’ll say this once and never mention it again but I loved/love him. Yet, sometimes love isn’t enough. In the end he loves drugs much more than he could ever love me and I clung to anything else that would give me a feeling of acceptance that I felt I lacked in and out of our relationship. Late last night after the argument, J.A. and I had a sort of confrontation where I realized he will always think I’m horrible and evil for not being able to deal with everything he dealt me. I was not and am not who he needs. It hurt to accept it but it was OK because everyone needs something different. So I let go for the last time. Today I woke up and felt new and refreshed. For the first time in a long time I feel OK that I’m alone and I’m OK that I will be for what I expect will be a long time.
I can really say this is the best camp i ever had! Hoping for next year!!!

She never made it back to the fourth quarter – was missing, presumed dead, but her former lover never stopped looking. Jonathon Feagul flew from rooftop to rooftop searching the sections of Speedway and finding nothing. He often sat across from the Conch Villaheights peering from the spires at the short balcony of the last place she had been seen alive. Then he would swoop down and away over the lake amongst the tall conifers.
I sat down and analyzed my storage needs. This was easy for me since I was really lacking and living without for a few months now, and living with piles of insanity. I knew exactly what I wanted to keep the area useful for me:

So Tuesday night, (still on the busy high) I took my busy-ness energy to a whole 'nother level and cleaned the laundryroom. Now that the male Golden's kennel is in the garage for the time being, I felt it was necessary to clean off the things that had gotten piled up on the counters in the last several months. Got a large garbage bag of junk to get rid of and a bag or two of Goodwill stuff. I can now see the places where I typically store the crock pots and other small appliances.
decent instincts of the poor are against these practices, and indeed they have used them less than any other class. But, owing to their poverty, lack of learning, and helplessness, the poor are the natural victims or those who wish to make experiments on their fellows. In the midst of London, a woman, who is a doctor of German philosophy (Munich) has opened a Birth Control Clinic where working women are instructed in a method of contraception described by Professor McIlroy as ‘the most harmful method of which I have had experience.’”
5.) An incident at Girl Scout camp with outdoor latrines. I noticed an enormous log of scout (Bear?) turd at the bottom of the hole, which gave me an idea. I brought in the other leader’s daughter, Sherri, as my accomplice. While the leaders overcame hangovers, we lined up all the scouts and told them we had a “surprise” for them.

Gravity was invented in 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton, who famously watched an apple fall from a tree to the ground and thought, “Huh – that’s weird.” Before this invention, people and objects would just drift off into space with nothing to hold them Earth-bound. Jesus ascended into heaven. Moses got the Red Sea to rise up so the Jews could escape from the pharaoh. Genghis Khan and his Mongol hordes were able to invade and defeat rival civilizations because they rode on flying horses.
Finally, it’s the ultimate list of ‘em all… one of the most important. Made famous by the movie of the same title (or was it the other way around?). After seeing the movie I immediately began a new list. It’s a list of things to do before I kick the bucket i.e. before I am deceased, departed, cold as a carp… gone to the great beyond.
Dear Kindle,

In multiple 10 team leagues, I just don’t have the roster space at the current time to gamble on an unproven player — even if that player dazzled in limited spring training appearances. Some gambles pay off, while others set you back. Mendoza has great talent as evidenced by his stuff but he appears to be going through rookie growing pains. And while he’s not completely off my radar, he’s just too inconsistent at the start of the season to warrant any roster space.
Have you read Warriors by Erin Hunter? If so, heres a really cool site that you can role play cats.
In some ways you can be more open to it as a solo performer, and might be able to hear it clearer and more directly. The audience is part of the show, the room is part of the show, the lighting, the noise in the room or outside, the time of day, season, EVERYTHING.
Guess who it was for? Well, obviously me, or I probably wouldn't find this story as hilarious. I asked the guy who it was from. "Maybe the card will say," he said cryptically.
Assuming Ottawa won’t do a Sarge-for-Martin trade, a true Power Play coach needs to be hired and a true Quarterback needs to be found. Even a defensive cypher or specialist like Tampa’s Marc-Andre Bergeron could be forgiven for defensive miscues if he could get the Power Play up to the Lemieux-approved mark of over 20%. Failure to convert Power Plays, almost as much as giving up Short-Handed Chances Against, murdered the Pens in the series against Philadelphia.
Again, the boy shrugged. Fuckington decided to give up with this simpleton. The nobleman who owned this territory had surely been lax in his role as patriarch. This was the very reason that his manual of instruction was so vital to the health of the kingdom. It was obvious that even the aristocracy needed guidance in the ways of administration. He thrust the reigns into the boy’s hands and made his way inside.

The illustration on the right is for the origin of everything in the database. You could spend all day with this database discovering the most fascinating facts.

Truth be told, part of this is probably my fault. Now that I have Wifesy, I find myself putting less and less into my friendships. Well, plainly, because I’m married. However, I know – down in the deepest parts of me – that this is a mistake. A human needs friends. When Wifesy and I were in Scotland, everyone at her school was younger than Wifesy. Way younger, since Wifesy went back to school at 32. So, we hung around with these youngsters, which was fine, but I’m telling you – a 22 year old and a 37 year old, just do NOT have the same philosophical perspective on life. They just don’t. They can have a beer together, but they can not go deep. And I’m one of these bar-talking, gathering-having individuals who likes to go deep with my conversations. When I’m socializing, it’s my raison d etre. I remember I had a bar conversation with a friend of a friend – a Chicago man – who swore to me he was Jesus and by the end of the conversation, he was crying. Now, I understand he was a bit nutty. I know he was a bit much. However, he was such a good conversationalist that by the end of the evening I thought he was one of the best people I’d ever met. I was glad I’d had that conversation. I was glad I had met him. That must’ve been ten years ago and I remember that conversation to this day. Now, I’m not saying I’d want Jesus-man around me everyday – a bit intense, in reality, BUT there was something in his banter that conveyed what he meant. He was trying to say that there was god in all of us, even as he explained it in the most convoluted, yet highly entertaining way. I love someone who can verbally tap dance like that. It’s one of the many reasons why I love comedians, but not comedians who are on all the time. I like the jokey philosophers. I like the Gayles.
As for me? While the current incarnation of the Doctor isn’t my favorite, I still think the crossover idea is fun all on its own. That said, I’m disappointed in the lack of mouth-frothing fan fits, as I tend to be greatly amused by such antics whenever something like this is announced. Ah, well.
The ST Clan were first to mark their intentions. They blasted their mighty battle trumpet which boomed over the rolling hills with the notes of light lemon grass, charred caramel and dried straw. It was an intimidating war cry - there was no doubt about that. The Myrcenary Battalion responded in kind however. A flood of dried apricots, orange pith and marshmallows reigned down upon the plains, scattering the faint of heart.

I enjoyed this book, as it’s not that long I finished it in one day. While the first two books for the most part revolved around Roskin and those around him, in this book there is a definite move to wrap up several smaller character’s back story and I think introduce them as major players in the upcoming story.
Exotic Patricia Medina, the British-born but half-Spanish actress whose eclectic credits include MGM’s big remake of The Three Musketeers (1948), Abbott and Costello in the Foreign Legion (1950), Orson Welles’s Mr. Arkadin (1955), Snow White and the Three Stooges (1962), and that loopiest of Japanese-American co-productions, Latitude Zero (1969), died last Saturday at the age of 92.

The woman survived, and Austin's friends turned on him, according to defense attorney Andrew Grimes. Now 17, Austin pleaded guilty Monday to five charges and faces 25 years in prison without parole. “He was trying to make money for clothes and, instead of getting a job, he took a shortcut,” Grimes said.
“This case is just unprecedented in a number of levels, including the public interest,” he said.
Utterly brilliant. I suspect that his act must involve the use of internet searching (of audience members), radio technology and props. Though he will deny it I think at least one of the participants was a stooge. There is no other way to explain the 'magic'. Some classic hypnotic techniques were used. I almost went under but as soon as he said "You're really clever..." I knew that he couldn't possibly mean me and so I snapped out of it.
Wonton is head down with spine on the right hand side. The feet are sticking out at the top left of my belly, just under my left breast. She showed us the perfect little feet (which looked SO SO SO CUTE – like little footprints) and I asked her how long they were. So she measured them for me. Wonton’s feet are about 6 cm long. Which seems GIGANTIC when you think about the baby being 15.5 inches long in total, and only 3.5 pounds. The feet are longer than 2 inches each!!!

President Bush is certainly entitled to ask for a big thank you for keeping this country safe from terrorists despite the efforts of Democrats, who will have only themselves to blame if there is another terrorist attack. And the American people certainly owe him some gratitude for what he's done for the economy, which has begun to falter not so coincidentally only since the election of a Democrat majority in Congress. Thanks to his policies a number of Americans got a chance to see what it would be like to live in homes they could not afford, memories they will always cherish long after the banks foreclose on them. And if it wasn't for President Bush, there might be no New Orleans at all. Thanks to his efforts, New Orleans has the first white majority city council in 22 years, which as James Joyner at Outside the Beltway points out, is a "good thing" because it means the city has shifted "away from race-based voting." This would not have been possible without President Bush's leadership. I hope that on this Thankstaking holiday, the President takes some credit for all that he has done for this country.

Happy book birthday to Elizabeth Norris! We're lucky to have an interview with her today, so read on to hear how this former high school English and history teacher wrote her first novel. As for the rest? She traded in the southern California beaches and sunshine for Manhattan's recent snowpocalyptic winter. She harbors dangerous addictions to guacamole, red velvet cupcakes, sushi, and Argo Tea, fortunately not all together. UNRAVELING, out today from Balzer & Bray, is the story of one girl's fight to save her family, her world, and the one boy she never saw coming. Find her at liznorris.blogspot.com or on twitter @liz_norris.
Earlier this week, you said Governor Romney, after he released his taxes, you said that you were satisfied with the level of transparency of his personal finances when it comes to this. And I just want to reiterate and ask you, are you satisfied right now with the level of transparency as far as his personal finances?
I am incredibly indecisive..

Her eclectic mix of art pop is back on top form. She hasn’t changed which is something I love about this artist. She doesn’t rely on her image, outlandish press stunts, crazy meat dresses or getting into twitter feuds with other celebrities to get her fame, she earns it. Not only is she the master of her make-believe, she’s the master of her image and her own genre. Words can’t describe what genre this record is. It’s just Santigold. What’s not to love?
This is, for once, not supposed to be insulting. It may sound insulting, but it’s not meant to be. You are unaware (a.k.a. ignorant) of the vast mountain of evidence in favour of evolution. You are unaware of the extreme amount of evidence and reasoning that debunks the bible and other assorted holy books. You are unaware that there is no evidence for your god or the gods of any other faith out there. You are unaware of these things, but your ignorance of the testable, natural world is why I may call you things like stupid and moronic. You yourself have even admitted that you are ignorant of a lot of things contained in the bible, so again this is not supposed to be insulting. Learn something. I used to be ignorant just like you, but I learned something. I took it upon myself to learn the other side, even if I disagreed with it, because I wanted to know things. I knew basically all I could know about the bible, and that wasn’t enough for me. I could keep learning about the bible, when it wouldn’t do me much, if any, good, because I already knew so much about it, so I sought out things that disagreed with me and challenged what I thought I knew was the truth. Yes, through my truth seeking, I came to a conclusion that you and my former self didn’t like, but that is why I no longer believe in the things you believe, because I became aware, and I became less ignorant of things; I filled the hole that was my ignorance of certain things with knowledge of them so that I could be more right. Being right is very nice. You think you are right within your scope of reality and knowledge, but you aren’t. Within the scope of the Israelites, they believed the Earth was the centre of the universe and that it was flat. To them, they were right. To us, they were demonstrably wrong. Sure, they were right about a few things back then, but they were still wrong about that and a lot more. That is what you are. You are Israelites challenging the modern world in the field of knowledge, almost literally.
This is the Book I read and highly recommend it as well as any book this lovely lady writes. I had loaned it out so I will have to get another one. Yes, you will want to read it more than once as it is so very interesting.
And that's how it's done! I know that sometimes the colors may seem intimidating, but if you REMOVE one of the colors from the combo and think of it strictly for accents, it often makes things a LOT easier, as you can see by the awesome Dollie talent above! So do you want to play?

The challenge starts with earning an A in Wines Class, which is touted as the hardest class on campus for culinary students. Candidates must also have a 3.5 grade point average at the time they apply for the scholarship. Along with the application, each student submits a resume and an essay. The essay must demonstrate the student’s vast knowledge of wine and relevant personal experience. Applicants must have a “compelling career interest in the culinary arts, hospitality, and wine,” according to Steven Kolpan, Professor of Wine Studies. The students with the best essays are then put through a rigorous interview process, and only then are the winners chosen. Even after Kopf Scholars are chosen, they must submit an essay to the scholarship provider on their experience.

One might term this group the forgotten 33%, because no special interest will speak for them. They have neither the numbers nor the financial wherewithal to decisively influence elections...

Some people will notice that some of their old negative ways of thinking will simply be gone and sometimes addictions fall away. Don't worry if you have scary dreams during the sessions. As one releases old repressed fear out of their energy system then the mind can give it a symbol. The symbols and fear are coming from your own mind. The energy work is not causing anything, only helping to release old stuck energy and emotions.

In Frey and Liese have known each other for a long time. He is faithful, supportive and tolerant (which I know might be annoying to some). He knows Liese like the back of his hand, and so does Liese. Frey has managed to hid his love for Liese for years, believing she was happy with her boyfriend, and later on husband. And the only time he reveals his love is when she is no longer attached to anyone. As his best friend and someone he cares deeply for, all he wants to do is heal her of whatever hurting she is going through. Once the best friend (beta) gets his girl and they decide to take their friendship to the lovers level, everything changes, and marks the beginning of a challenging relationship.

My previous post threw down the latex gauntlet announcing that, “My medical data should move with me as easily as my music or photo library…”, because, well, it sure doesn’t. And I blamed that problem partly on healthcare IT vendors’ current practice of requiring custom interfaces to be written for every application that wants to interoperate with them. How do other industries avoid this problem? Stay with me to learn the deep dark secret…

Now here is something a little off the wall (literally). Have you given any thought to the effect colour has on productivity? Well this painting company has. It seems painting the walls in your office blue may actually make the staff more productive. Pink on the other hand is tranquilizing and may make the staff want to fall asleep. Be careful with red as it is thought to make people more cautious and accurate but it also raises blood pressure and heart rate. And better stay away from yellow as people tend to lose their tempers most often in yellow rooms. Who knew?

For a few days, I felt hurt. And that didn't make much sense, since I believe - in my head, anyway - that people do what they can do. I haven't always been perfect at supporting people when they were going through hard times.

My shoes were sinful deceivers. I wore them to work and chased children all day. I did this several times. Would my shoes hold up? Would they be kind? Would my feet survive? They would and they did. This was excellent. I could take these shoes with me to the city so that my feet might withstand the walking.

While at first I was somewhat unimpressed, a few more times listening to the entire album and I began to appreciate some of the subtle nuances in KTL. Peter Rehberg, in my mind, is the star of the show. While O'Malley obviously provides the meat and potatoes in most of the songs, it is Rehberg's various electronic and industrial elements which provide that special flair to the songs. While sometimes they are more effective than others (comparing "Forestfloor 3" to "Forestfloor 2"), they always, somehow, perfectly complement the elements O'Malley is adding. Given the satisfactory nature of this album, I look forward to someday hearing "KTL 2". Although I am not the biggest fan of (what could be argued as) Stephen O'Malley's posturing on many of his more recent releases (such as that of the just-released Grave Temple Trio album: "Me and Greg and a few other guys played in Israel even though our families told us not to!"), it is the unavoidable truth that he (along with his collaborators) are slowly making waves within their respective subgenres, changing them radically (hopefully for the better).

The house we're blessed with is a nice Cape Cod style home with an attached garage, but no basement. When we purchased it from the previous owners, it had two bedrooms and two full bathrooms down stairs along with two bedrooms, a "bonus" room, and an unfinished bathroom upstairs. With just the three of us, the gals and I decided we didn't need to finish the third bathroom upstairs... hmmm, what to do with that eight by nine foot room? Why that could be our gun room.

As a result, going into the game Monday, I was not nearly as apprehensive as I had been before any game the previous two seasons. Add that I had to race home from work and then over to the field in order to just barely make it before the game started. Before I headed to the field, however, I had the forethought to grab a bottle of rosé and make sure it found its way into the fridge. As I mentioned, it was a hot day and I knew I would want something chilly when we got home after the game.

Obviously getting the best athletes together with the best coaches WORKS. Once upon a time, Maurice Greene sat in the stands of our Olympic Trials and watched as others made the team he felt he should have been on. He then moved half way across the country from Missouri to Los Angeles to be trained by John Smith. After four individual World Championships, an Olympic title and an Olympic bronze for good measure, Greene retired as the G.O.A.T. (Greatest of All Time) in the 100 meters. This past year, British distance runner Mo Farah decided that he too needed to find a coach and group that would take him to the top. So he came across the Atlantic Ocean and across the United States to Oregon to train with Salazar and his group. His reward, gold in the 5000 and silver in the 10000 in Daegu!
I shop twice a month. That’s it. Two trips a month. To be sure, it’s a big haul…and I don’t like going to the grocery store every other day (I know…how very suburban) so, as not to waste food, I make things according to what needs to be used before it goes bad. I really do loathe losing good produce, and I rarely do. I almost never throw anything out, and I’m really proud of that.
Oh Yay! I just thought of something totally unrelated to my own saga of TTCing. Now I will talk about one of my Rabbits who TTC'd a couple weeks ago. I confirmed pregnancy yesterday. I could feel her babies moving and rolling inside her. Yes, I AM living vicariously through my rabbit. LOL! So I will have cute baby bunnies to love on in about two weeks. I am very, very excited and looking forward to them. I just hope this doe is as good of a first time Mommy as her own Mother was.
Life cruised on . . . we were parenting two teens and a middle schooler, but someone was missing . . . two someones to be exact. And then along came Brogan, born two months after my 41st birthday. Such a miraculous blessing. Where would we be without our Brogie boy? Beloved little brother. God had already promised Teddi to my heart (though I hadn't found her yet) when Brogan entered our world-- just nine months and thirteen days ahead of his sister's birth in China. Three more prayerful years would pass before the Lord would reveal His promise, but she was oh so worth the wait . . .

Similarly, 3 ½ years is also defined as 42 months since seven years is the equivalent to 84 months. Therefore a “prophetic month” is 30 days long since 1260 days divided by 42 months equals 30 days/month.

My timer has gone off at least 6 times since I started writing this. Mister has rolled his eyes at me every time I stopped and came over to him and gave him a kiss. I’ve reassured him that I am not setting the timer for him, but for me. I don’t want to get so lost I can’t hear the kids when they call my name. What I’m doing is not so important that Mister has to wait for an hour and a half before asking me a question. I do this so I don’t forget that while writing makes me happy, I have people that make me happier. I want to be available to them. And… much like Mister, I love those little kisses!

To pitch to the score, Morris would give up only as many runs as warranted. If his team scored seven runs, hey, why not, he'd give up five or six. But if his team scored just one run (something Morris' teams rarely did since they were excellent offensively), he would bare his teeth and throw a shutout (like he did in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series). It was a comfortable theory and might have held except for two things:
There are some fiery pedantic arguments over the subject. I mean venomous exchanges between linguists and linguistical hobbyists. I'll bet some of those commenters angrily flared their nostrils while they pounded out their lively responses to the articles.

I am not saying that it has been a "happily married life" through out, because at times there were problems for us as well. Some times a living together did looked like a struggle together for a better living. And during these many years of our marriage, we resolved problems more than enjoying conjugal bliss...

With this exposure, her cure is initiated, and so is Chapter Three: Despair (Gynocide). It is during this part of the film that some of the most awful and appalling imagery appears. After announcing that her treatment has been successful, He comes to realize that the result is not what he had expected. Her defenses lowered, She comes into full contact with her inner nature, experiencing the sublime force and savagery of desire unleashed. She furiously copulates with her husband, and then masturbates madly before exploding in an uncontrolled rage because she fears that her husband will leave her. She crushes his testicles with a wooden beam, knocking him unconscious, rubs his penis until he ejaculates blood and drills a hole in his leg, to which she then attaches a heavy mill stone in order to keep him from leaving. She wanders away and He eventually regains consciousness, flees with difficulty and hides in a hole beneath a tree. (The hole, no doubt, represents a vagina, which in this film is both a danger and a lure to the male character. Throughout the film, the female lead is terrified of this particular tree hole; an indication that she fears her own nature.) While in the hole, He encounters a blackbird whose loud, cawing cries betray his hiding place, and so his wife finds him and drags him back to the cabin.

The Grateful Dead had such a loyal following that their fans not only came to a few shows, many of them followed the band all over the country on any given tour. What defines a band is its fans. Without fans, a band has nothing; no one to sing along with their songs or wait for them return to their town to pay for the next show. Some fans were so passionate about the Dead’s vision that they followed them for many years. These hardcore fans were dubbed “Deadheads” and represented the soul of the Grateful Dead.

A corollary of this is the anti-White version of history: Whites have always been stupid, crazy, evil haters, persecuting and oppressing everyone else, and specifically jews.
But yeah, goddamnit, you do have to deal with his presence in public spaces, even if he's acting like a little turd; you do have to recognize that because I have all that other stuff to do, I might be slightly less at the disposal of my employer for a few years (then again, no one should be at the disposal of their employer 24/7 anyway); you do need to deal with the times when I bring him into work because there is work I can't put off and there is no one else who can care for him on that day; and you do, I think, have an obligation to figure out social and economic policies that take into account the fact that this is not only my life, but the life of most adults at some point sooner or later. And in exchange, my friends, I and he have an obligation to deal with you when you have had a shitty day and are being a turd in a public space; or when you have to leave work early to pick up a friend at the airport or because you have opera tickets or a hot date; or when you have to call in sick; or when your illness turns out to be acute and far more expensive than any individual can afford; or when you get old and need to retire, and yadda yadda yadda.

HAPPY WEDDING ANNIVERSARY INDU
In the past fortnight I’ve lost 4 kg and have discovered a clarity of mind and a reassuring sense of calm. I’ve realised how often I was turning to grab a glass of wine or some chocolate when I felt stressed or upset, or a strong coffee to ‘pick me up’ when I felt tired. Somehow by turning to these little indulgences I was wrapping myself in cotton wool, a comforting layer which was shielding me from the pain which lay beneath. Particularly after losing Mum, the comfort of these ‘innocent addictions’ shielded me from the depths of my pain. Unfortunately, this emotional ‘cotton wool layer’ was translating into an ever-expanding physical layer as well.

We played some shower games, and then it was present time. Ok this is a long aside but stick with me. Have any of you heard of the five love languages? It's a concept by Gary Chapman which states that people give and receive love in five different ways: acts of service, physical touch, words of affirmation, quality time, and gifts. If you are in a relationship or even if you're not and just want to see how you receive love from friends and family, I highly suggest you read the book and take the quiz to figure out which language you speak. I've taken the quiz multiple times. My top love language is gifts, followed by words of affirmation. I say all of this to say that I felt extremely loved at my shower :)
OK so I am not sure they would agree on all the above.
Exterminate pests. Not only are pests kind of creepy and unwelcome in our homes, they can also leave behind an allergy triggering residue.

The Stopes vs Sutherland trial ended with criticism of Marie Stopes being heard in the highest court in the land and with at least one of her allegations against Sutherland being dismissed as ‘absurd.’ The enormous costs that she was made to pay were a setback to her work. Unfortunately the courts would not long remain places where human dignity was upheld yet Sutherland can remain for us a model of courage and tenacity in defence of human life.
The woman tried again.
As is common in most towns, the name of the town is incorporated into the names of many shops and other businesses. An example occurs in this Edwardian pub (bearing the date 1910) whose name is a pun on both the name and the meaning of “Kingston”. In modern parlance, a tun is a barrel or the amount of liquid contained in one, but here it can also allude to “tun”, the Anglo-Saxon word for a farm or estate. So the name can be both taken at its face value as “The King’s tun (barrel”) or as the archaic name of the town. A bit laboured perhaps, though not altogether unamusing.
I try to stick with as natural coloring as possible, so the bottom two layers are made completely with natural pandan extract pounded with a mortar and pestle whereas the final layer had a little help from a few drops of green coloring. I know the cream sandwiching the layers are very meagre, but that's really because my brother is not a fan of cream of any sorts, and would scrap off any cream he sees on a cake, so I decided to save him the trouble by putting minimal cream in between and very 'scrapable' whipped cream on the outside.
And yes, before some points out, back when mohammad actually thought he could fool Jews and Christians into accepting islam, he recited peaceful semi-remembered Christian and Jewish suras that he later replaced (or aborgated) with oppression and violence and murderous suras against all who will not accept islam. If only deceived muslims truly understood this. But, they are brainwashed from birth to believe so many lies that they truly do not know the truth when they hear and see it.

I hang up the key to the house where I grew up, and recall my childhood, running barefoot through the back alleys of Detroit. The little Polish dancer wears the same costume my dashing husband wore performing with his dance group Polanie. The glass pen celebrates the year my first book was published. A tiny guitar marks the year my husband broke his leg and, instead of sulking on the couch, taught himself to play guitar. It hangs near Eli’s tiny oboe, and Bea’s violin and clarinet. A small glass bottle contains ash from Mt. St. Helens, collected from my pants cuff in 1980, when I was caught bird watching in Eastern Washington during the eruption.
Instead of focusing on one image from a segment of the text (originally ‘The king of hearts called for the tarts and beat the knave full sore’) I decided to draw out a narrative. Hugely inspired by the book ‘Handmade Graphics’ artist Joe McClaren’s print work especially his castle image (below)

A big news item that has broken today is that teens are getting drunk off of hand sanitizer, with some apparently going into ER with alcohol poisoning. What in the world is up with that?! I’m obviously not geeking about anything here — except maybe the fact that I’m glad to be of legal drinking age and with more than half-a-brain to be trying anything so stupid. When I first heard this news item this morning, I instantly had that quote from Sheldon Cooper in mind. So I guess I’m paying some sort of warped homage to him.

She used a lot of buzzwords at staff meetings, but never really gave us anything concrete, or anything that told me she actually knew what she was talking about. Especially when she started quoting stats about how one of her tweets could reach 163,000 people (but she only had 147 followers). Then, she gave us a handout that she ‘designed to explain social media’ (I later found the same handout inexplicably designed by someone else on a .37 second google search):

Included on this volume is audio commentary by Ohana (CV Kanae Itou), Minko (CV Chiaki Omigawa) and Nako (CV Aki Toyosaki) on the final episode. They start out so happy to see each other again, crack jokes about Minko being a tsundere maid at a cafe after the series, but they end up in tears thinking about how they’ll part again soon. It’s a very sorrow commentary compared to the others. Also included are two staff commentaries: the first is on episode 25 by the episode directors Takefumi Anzai and Heo Jong as well as line producer Mitsuhito Tsuji while the second takes place over the final episode with Supervisor Masahiro Ando, producer Kenji Horikawa, and producer Takayuki Nagatani. Both talk about their favorite parts of the series and how happy they were to work on it.

Tilda Swinton was captivating to watch. She played a complex character that underwent several transitions in her lifetime. The part of the son was played by several different child/teen actors which they did a great job of casting. The only strange casting choice was John C. Reilly. The part called for a banal performance but once again his face and voice are way too funny and I didn’t feel like laughing while watching this movie.

A whole bunch of hundreds of websites can provide the opportunity to generate income from answering surveys, and even let you recognize when extra surveys are available. Oftentimes, signing up for the survey alerts comes free of charge. Some surveys may be extra up your alley than others, depending upon where you might be or who you are. To search out the most effective surveys, simply log onto the Internet, hearth up your search engine, and find these surveys by coming into search keywords equivalent to “paid on-line survey.” A lot of the surveys on sites you'll finally come throughout provide you with a small amount of cash per instance of finishing a survey. Others draw from a pool of people that have taken the survey, choose a variety of folks from your complete group, and award money to those chosen.
This photo of Wineglass Bay on Tasmania’s Freycinet Peninsula was taken using an extremely slow shutter-speed of 80 seconds. With most cameras you won’t be able to keep the shutter open for 80 seconds without a) ending up with stacks of motion blur and b) ending up with a completely white image (because too much light reached the sensor). In fact in broad daylight shooting at ISO100 and a normal 35mm (or digital equivalent) camera, you probably won’t be able to keep the shutter open for more than about 1/10th of a second without ending up with some serious overexposure issues; most of the time in sunlight I’m shooting at 1/250 and f/8, or thereabouts.
Moore comes across more as the leader behind this effort, the one pushing the “vision” of this effort the most, with his songwriting, vocals, keyboard textures, and the sampling that has become a big part of his songcrafting style. It doesn’t take long into the opening track before CBS News anchor Dan Rather’s recorded voice is featured in a meltdown panic over some “communications problem” and you realize how much sampling will play a part in this CD, but the sampling isn’t overdone anywhere. Moore’s keys and the overall engineering give this kind of a Pink Floydish feel. Then Matheos’ metalish guitar chimes in, Portnoy starts pounding the snot out of the kit, and Malone provides an understated but eloquent bass underpinning. You quickly realize, “Hey, this could be pretty darn interesting.”

Going back to the woman in IT talk, Whitney talked about what companies and individuals could do to ensure women could advance in IT. A subject I feel strongly about. Yet when listening to the talk, I kept feeling that I was left out - that Whitney wasn’t talking neither to nor about me. The reason was that I am not in a position to make company decisions, and that the individuals that Whitney was talking to, about what they could do, was the women. Not the men. All the recommendations didn’t relate to me and daily life.
In a large stock pot add drained soaked beans, onions, garlic, 1 tsp Herbs de Provence and the bay leaf. Pour just enough water to cover. Bring to boil and reduce to a simmer, adding more water as needed. When beans are almost finished add the chicken stock, diced carrots and celery and the remaining 1 tsp Herbs de Provence. Cook beans, celery and carrots until tender. Stir in the shredded chicken and the baby spinach. Salt and pepper, to taste.

A trip to the peaceful Village of Pateley Bridge is always good for my soul. I love going through to my Mum’s house, it’s a stunning little village in the Yorkshire Dales and is a perfect place to visit when in need of an escape from the daily routine that’s become my ‘comfort’ zone. This picture on the far left was taken last summer just down the road from her house. She’s got two amazing dogs, Jess is a black and white cross between a Boxer and a Collie and Meg is a brown Collie. More recently she’s got herself a pet Kune Kune Pig called squiggles.
Rogue's Winter Seasonal Brew. Although I do fancy the label on Santa's Private Reserve, I think that maybe Santa should keep his beer reserves to himself. It is a little overbearing with the cinnamon and spices which keeps me from enjoying this Ale. Maybe I just had high hopes since I enjoy the Dead Guy Ale so much. But to be fair I honestly shouldn't have gone in thinking it would be nearly the quality of a beer that is produced 12 months a year. There are plenty of better winter ales out there (see any of the Samuel Adams brews) that I would recommend over this one.

During the strongest gusts of wind, the split in the tree would open up quite a bit more, and the cone must have fallen into the split during one of those times, higher up where the split was wider. Then, when the wind died down between gusts, the split would close back up, crushing the cone a little more with each cycle of gust and calm, with the cone moving down a little more each time as well.

We learn that Grandpa's real name is Ernest Schedrach and that he is "the white son of a white coal miner in Ohio" who bought the land Swamplandia is on in 1932. Hilola Bigtree's maiden name was Owens and she, too, was born on the mainland. In one of the Swamplandia buildings is a display area that has family artifacts, including Schedrach's army medallions. "The Chief" works hard to make sure that nothing in the case sullies the manufactured Indian identity of the Bigtree family. He takes the medallions out, and makes sure there is no mention of the family's white roots.

My advice – avoid crossing all the bridges along Punggol Waterway or even the red bridge heading to Lorong Halus Wetland during the thunderstorms. There is no shelter on the bridges and they can be counted as some of the highest elevation among the surroundings.
I did have her Thundershirt on, and sometimes she thinks the world is coming to an end when that happens. It could be a factor. The runs didn’t go great, but I did experiment with a few things, she was better with her startline stay, she nailed in contacts (running too!!) and had fun. The most fun she had was when we ran FEO in a beginner’s run instead of intermediate. She’s technically an intermediate level but the courses weren’t too fun for her and so I dropped her down for FEO and she did fantastic!!
I know this is supposed to be a blog about unschooling. But, since all my angst is gone I've hardly mentioned it at all in the past year. So, today I'm going to start with two unschooly (but, brief) items. First off, my blog was included in a list of the top 8 unschooling blogs! Can you believe it!? Wait a minute–don't answer that. Anyway, it was quite an honor to be included on that list, so I just wanted to share it with you. But, now I feel obliged to write something about unschooling. So here goes:

Mlodinow is a fascinating character, having made forays into video game design, science fiction, collaborations with Stephen Hawking, and writing for Star Trek (as noted in the Los Angeles Times profile). That he is at Cal Tech makes me imagine another Leonard, Mr. Hofstadter of The Big Bang Theory. He's said to be just as funny also--perhaps there's inspiration here?

NAMA’s purchase price and development costs: Not disclosed. NAMA Chairman Frank Daly did say that NAMA’s purchase price and additional development costs were less than the sale price. And on that basis, NAMA claimed a profit from the sale. The purchase price of the loan should have reflected the value of the Montevetro development on 30th November 2009 (NAMA’s valuation date). In addition NAMA paid the banks a Long Term Economic Value premium which has averaged 10% for the first two tranches acquired by the agency in 2010.

There were two reasons for this scourging to stop; either of which were grounds for abstinence. He was a Roman citizen, which would certainly come as a shock to any and all. But, you will say, they whipped the Lord Jesus Christ and he was uncondemned. True, but He was a Jew, which meant that it was proper according to Roman law. Paul was more than a Jew. He was Roman. For Roman citizens to be whipped without trial was definitely unlawful.

I have very often talked about how we live in the Information Age and that means, to me, taking very seriously the information that is presented to us. It is to be checked, drafted, discarded, kept. Probably not really in that order but all those steps are vital to a healthy mind.
After 3 years of pleading with State officials who, rather than take any action at all, routinely defer their investigatory authority to one another, we were obligated as business owners to direct our concern to other entities that may have a less biased view regarding the seriousness of the allegations made. The U.S. Department of Justice declined to pursue the allegations citing the matter as a State level issue and suggested contacting the State Attorney General, which had already twice previously occurred.

Brulee looked about as they walked. Down in the central terrace a class of young draenei were being led about the holoprojectors depicting various types of agents of the Burning Legion. It was one of the more recent projects completed in The Exodar, the refurbishing of one of their most important teaching tools. Images of the Legion were familiar to all Draenei, whether they had faced them in combat before or not, as well as strategies to defeat them. Sometimes even their allies would come to learn from this presentation, to share with their students at their home.
Perhaps the U.S. should celebrate the day, too, at least in those states who were not in the old Confederacy. On May 5, 1862, Mexicans under the command of 33 year old Commander General Ignacio Zaragoza Seguín stopped the quick advance of superior French forces trying to invade Mexico to take it over, at the Battle of Puebla. While France did eventually defeat Mexican forces (after getting 30,000 men in reinforcements), the spirit of May 5 inspired Mexicans to continue to fight for freedom. And ultimately, Mexican forces overpowered and captured the French forces and Emperor Maximilian, who was executed.

“So then, what is the message I bring to you today? Is it our common future? It seems to me that we are living in a time of prophecy, a time of definitions and decisions. We are the generation with the responsibilities and the option to choose the the path of life for the future of our children, or the life and path which defies the Laws of Regeneration. Even though you and I are in different boats –you in your boat and we in our canoe — we share the same River of Life: what befalls me, befalls you. And downstream, downstream in this River of Life, our children will pay for our selfishness, for our greed, and for our lack of vision.

Now iconic symbols of Mexico, Saltillo sarapes, to paraphrase Hali, are a sort of Tlaxcalan (Northern Mexican) and Spanish hybrid -- what came about when the old cotton weaving traditions of the Tlaxcalans crossed paths with the wool-making methods of Spanish colonists.

I’ve written enough about the kinds of mental and physical strategies that I had to employ to get through this. For anyone contemplating doing this or taking on a major project of any kind I want to stress one thing – you must have the right support. First and foremost, I have been blessed to have the most amazing support from my wife, Ophelia. Having an MA in Classics herself, she was better equipped than most to bounce ideas around with at a high level. But more important than that was the fact that she believed in me on all those days, and there were an awful lot of them, when I struggled terribly to see a way forward, to believe that I could do it.

Jillian Grayson is a disillusioned divorcée and best-selling romance novelist who can't write a chapter without her hunky male heartthrob suffering ED, an STD, or even worse. Brian Nash is a tennis-obsessed, college senior who's unlucky in love and the roommate and best friend of Jillian's son, Rob. When Rob brings Brian home for spring break and he meets the surprisingly young and also tennis passionate Jillian, their shared interest quickly develops into an intense mutual attraction. After nearly giving in to their feelings, they hatch a plan, while under the influence (of something more than just the perfect Miami night), to be Friends With Partial Benefits complete with rules to define the boundaries. Will the lonely pair continue with this distinctive relationship, actually explore their desires or will they discover all of it is a really bad
By now the evening was almost dark. The house had descended into shadow and seemed profoundly empty. It no longer smelt like home but like the dust that settles on the top of an old box. It was a place of sadness and pain; a place where a man sat who had lost his children and didn't know what to do. A place where the owner didn't want to live there anymore. I let the letter box fall down and looked at Dan. “Come on, lets get outta here.” I said dejectedly, and without speaking a word of what we had seen we ran off and caught the bus back home.

People use Facebook in different ways, of course. And I don't mean people plugging their books on their professional Facebook pages - that's what those pages are for - but on their personal profiles, the pages for their friends and family. I have unfriended people in the past for using our 'friendship' as a means to try to sell me things (not books). It's not the occasional 'I have a new book out' - that's fine, it's news, it's an event to share with friends. It's the hardsell or the advertising with no news hook I don't like.

Somewhere a bit beyond the age of ten, I began to take more interest in my wardrobe, and the correlations of how this would affect what I thought my image was in public. Both of my younger sisters had begun doing this a long time ago, so perhaps girls start doing that sooner than boys. I think some begin as early as a year old, but perhaps a few of you might think it’s earlier than that.

I feel sometimes I am not doing my best to prove to them that they are just as important as Dustin, but they all have different needs right now. More time here means less time at home. But, I spent some time with them going to Landon's first soccer game of the season, playing mario party for a while (that was a new adventure for me), and I took them to dinner last night. It was difficult to drop them off because they are where some of my strength comes from. I know I am doing the best I can, so I try not to be too hard on myself.

My 3-year-old loves cars, trucks, trains, tractors- you name it. He is the only person I know who gets excited when we hit construction while driving (which seems to be everywhere in Utah County right now)! To me it's a little truck or a big truck but he corrects me on the specifics: pumper, grader, paver, roller etc. (I'm sure the fact that we are constantly renewing the Mighty Machines DVDs from the library has encouraged this fascination).

Kavita was growing in her grand father’s care but poverty and hunger obliged that old man to send her to Orphan’s Home.

So, she started working in houses as a maid servant. Her last schooling year was dissipated and she was very unhappy.

What’s happening in Wenzhou and Shiji is not an isolated exception. With CPI rising at 6.2-6.5%, and the regulated deposit rate at banks at 3.5%, China’s banks have recently seen a rush of withdrawals by savers seeking higher yields elsewhere. According to China Securities Journal, outstanding deposits at China’s “big four” banks fell by RMB 420 billion (US$ 65.7 billion) in the first 15 days of September. Most of that money, it reports, is being channeled straight into speculative assets, either directly or via “shadow” lending arrangements. I was asked by a reporter the other day what I thought about a Hong Kong-listed baby formula producer that was loading up on loans and relending the money to non-ferrous metals, tungsten, and highway companies. I replied: When companies neglect their core business and start speculating in “hot” sectors they know nothing about, especially with borrowed money, it’s a sure sign the market is out of whack. Sometimes it’s because companies themselves are caught up in the “irrational exuberance” of a speculative bubble. Other times, it’s because inflation, price controls, credit controls, or other factors are distorting normal incentives. In any case, it’s a big red flag that something is seriously wrong.

But Zawi turned up a few minutes later, and what a relief. Unfortunately, he had forgotten to bring along his Identity Card! He wanted to go back and get it. However, the court’s staff probably decided it was better to just be rid of me soonest; so they accepted his driving licence as proof enough of identity. My signature on that bond, and after receiving my IC, it was “Bye Bye, nice (and pretty) Mahkamah Syariah clerks!”.
"The etymology of Conservatism is straightforward. The term was first used as a description of a political party in a 50 page article, probably by John Wilson Croker, in the January 1830 Quarterly Review, a publication that generally supported the great Tory governments of 1783-1830, then in their last months of power before losing definitively to the Whigs in November of that year. The "Conservative" party was indeed the party that sought to preserve what was already there; in this case the specific constitution and policies of those Tory governments, which were by that time embattled.
* Continuing claims have also in a downtrend of late, but the road down has been bumpy. Last week they fell by 9,000 to 3.723 million. That is down 906,000 from a year ago. I would expect a further decline this week. The consensus is looking for a level of 3.700 million. Some of the longer-term decline due to people simply exhausting their regular state benefits which run out after 26 weeks. Those, however, don’t last forever either. Federally paid extended claims fell by 91,000 to 4.271 million, and are down by 1.467 million over the last year. Looking at just the regular continuing claims numbers is a serious mistake. They only include a little over half of the unemployed now given the unprecedentedly high duration of unemployment figures. A better measure is the total number of people getting unemployment benefits, currently at 8.524 million, which is down 296,000 from last week (there are some timing issues so the change in continuing and existing claims does not exactly match the change in the total). The total number of people getting benefits is now 2.543 million below year ago levels. What is not known is how many people have left the extended claims via the road to prosperity, finding a new job, and how many have left on the road to poverty, having simply exhausted even the extended benefits. Make sure to look at both sets of numbers! Many of the press reports will not, but we will here at Zacks.
LTTE sympathizers justify some of the assassinations by arguing that the people attacked were combatants or persons closely associated with Sri Lankan military intelligence.

"It's a difficult thing to have too many cooks in the kitchen, especially when all of them are iron chefs. Joel Phelps' semi-forced exit made a big difference. On one hand, it was bad: Phelps was an integral part of the band since its inception. And on the other, it was good: the pared-down sound fit the band well, and that's quite evident on the four-sided Firewater. Left to two voices, the band produces its most cohesive and precise set, despite it being their most broad; Firewater clocks in with 16 tracks at an hour long. Not a minute is wasted, and everything sounds more measured and relaxed. Lyrically, the themes of each song tie in with a couple concepts in mind, not suffering from the somewhat schizo topics of previous LPs. As the lone guitarist, Cohen spreads his wings, turning in some lengthy solos. At times, his scorchy leads seem twice as loud as the bass and drums, but it's called for each time. Midgett's thick bass becomes more of a centerpiece than an anchor, sounding its thickest yet. Stripped bare to the degree of sounding awkward on the first few listens, a couple songs rely mainly on light rhythms and little else. The record's themes of alienation and inebriation are balanced by spells of dark humor. Cohen is always reliable for the occasional zinger, and Midgett's woes-of-the-road "Miracle Mile" provides many yuks at the band's expense. Also, the occasional cathartic yelping and complex structures seem to be done away with, in favor of more classic influences (the Stones-y "Lure of Beauty") and decreasing tangential incidents. Though one hates to say it in the wake of Phelps, Firewater sounds like a band that's just lost its training wheels -- fuller yet less cluttered." - AMG
A hybrid between stealth, action, and puzzle, Warp is one of two currently-released titles from the Canadian indie developer Trapdoor Inc., the other being Fez for the rarely-known PlayStation-esque NES hardware clone, the PolyStation. Considering Trapdoor has clearly not had much taste in the more popular gaming culture, can Warp be their first success?…Well, kind of. GameSpot’s Jeremiah Johnson said that although the game had merits (enjoyable puzzles, charming balance of gore and cuteness, superb visuals, tough leaderboard challenge rooms), it also had its flaws, like clunky controls and some trial-and-error puzzles. On high, he said that it was an “entertaining top-down puzzler” that was still, however, weighed down. He gave the game a 6.5/10, which ranks as “fair” on the meter, an above-average level. Users were slightly more positive, upping the ranks to 7.2. IGN’s Daemon Hatfield was a lot more positive for the game, however. He called it “brainy and amusing”, and despite some hiccups around the final half of the game, he highly recommended it as a “rich, satisfying adventure.” He gave it an 8.5/10, which is not only “great” on the meter, but also received an Editor’s Choice award. So, yeah. IGN really likes this game. Joystiq gave it a 3/5-star score, saying that it wasn’t particularly memorable, and didn’t quite create an identity for itself, and pulled the inspiration from the many corners of gaming’s landscape, and for that reason, Warp got degraded a bit more. Game Informer gave the game a 6.75/10 score, saying that it was “promising at first, but it becomes more tedious as it progresses”. They said the simple factors of the game weren’t enough to make a standout in the Arcade, and that anyone looking to go deeper should choose a different game. Overall, Warp overall may have fatal flaws that push it back, but it does have its moments. Approach the game with caution.
Of course, Disney is an awesome place for any pirate fan. Not only is there the pirate voyage, but there's also the beloved Pirates of the Caribbean ride. That's always been a favorite of mine. I went on that ride when I was a baby at Disneyland, possibly right after it first opened. I honestly believe with all my heart, that that ride is my very first memory. I still remember seeing the skull & cross bones up on the wall above the tunnel. I couldn't have been more than a year old. Bizarre. Oddly, I didn't get into the movies when they first came out. I waited and saw the first two on DVD when they were released. By the time the third and fourth came out, I was hooked and went to the theaters to see them. Of course, the boys and I had to stop and get this picture while we were in Downtown Disney one night ...

No argument is necessary to convince us of the potency of home influence in shaping character. There are certain truths to which it is only necessary to call attention, and minds instinctively assent to them, and to this class, we believe, belong those general truths concerning home which we have mentioned. Indeed, they are recognized and taught in the trite maxims of every-day life. Napoleon understood well the nature of home and its mission when he said, “The great need of France is mothers.” An old Scotch proverb says, “An ounce of mother is worth a pound of clergy.” Mohammed said, “Paradise is at the feet of mothers.” Charles Edward Sargent, Our Home, or the Key to a Nobler Life Pg. 21-22

- I love being pregnant.
Friday night I went to FHE, where we played "Psychiatrist" (and had SUCH a blast at it too!), then I went and played the piano for a while. When I was heading out, I somehow got into this conversation with this lady, her name is Ana. She speaks such little English, and I speak such little Russian that the whole conversation took a super long time to figure out. Basically what I got after about ten minutes of talking is that her name is Ana, she’s Maxim’s mom, she teaches piano (and loves it!), and had some music for me if I want to have it. There was a lot more between, like how I absolutely love music - Ya (I) OCHEN (VERY) lyoublyou (love) musik! (music!), or how Maxim learned piano for three years, but then didn’t like it so quit. I really loved talking to Ana, I could tell she enjoyed the conversation too. Eventually someone came and asked if we needed a translator. I asked Ana, and I think she said that she didn’t; It was too fun trying to talk to her and recall the oh-so-few words that I even know in Russian. He translated a little anyways, saying that Ana didn’t know when she could get the music to me because she hardly ever sees me. We figured next Friday at FHE would work perfectly. We all headed out together and Ana and Maxim ended up walking me almost all the way home. Maxim didn't talk much, but Ana talked enough for the both of them :) We talked and laughed and learned words the whole way. My perception of the “gift of tongues” has definitely changed after my conversation with her. I in no way was able to fluently talk to her, but the “language barrier” between us seemed to be quite broken as I forged this new friendship even without understanding hardly a thing being said. That night, I had some great conversations with Lena and Sasha and George-o. We talked about how sometimes you can say something and people don’t understand it, but

There is no way to spin this. What she did was premeditated child neglect, child abuse and welfare fraud. And having 14 children while on disability for a “bad back” smacks of workman’s compensation fraud. It also speaks to her lack of any type of insight and judgment – maternal or otherwise.

This time, Pip told me that I was to act as each doll’s parent and that I should bring them into the examination room and explain to them what will happen during their visit with the doctor. He then handed me the first doll – a girl with stringy blond hair who we’ve named Olivia – and led us into the living room. As I walked in and sat down on the couch with Olivia on my knee, I was thinking ahead to naptime and how I needed to get a lasagna made for dinner, put a load of laundry in the wash, clean up the dishes from breakfast and lunch, and do some writing for the week’s blog post during that time. After waiting in silence for a few seconds, Pip impatiently prompted me to start explaining to Olivia what he and Polly were going to do. Stuttering a bit to get my words out, I quickly said, “Um, Olivia, this is, um, Dr. Pip and Nurse Polly…”

One of those is Brazilian singer Katia B, whose album Mais Uma/One More Shot has been playing on a loop on Killer Opening Songs' stereo. If you're looking for a cool chill-out record with plenty of soul and no lack of meaning, this is it. Mais Uma has a soft and funky groove that runs through each and every song, making the record grow on the listener slowly but surely. One of the main reasons for this is Killer Opening Song, Só Deixo Meu Coração Na Mão de Quem Pode.

It's a nation of black men nodding out on the opiates of white club pussy and juvenile braggadocio, conjuring up images like the ones in Mandingo to justify sagging pants and grills and thug badges worn proudly to the Church of Blame Whitey, while the poise and dignity of the Civil Rights Era shrinks in our rear-view mirror like Wile E. Coyote gone off the cliff. It's the big black dick that David Allan Coe whined about. It's a white-male ruling order that was destined, from day one, to push black males and white women together, rendering them strange bedfellows in the boudoir of mutual disenchantment.

I've gotten myself quite addicted to Pinterest lately. I always saw it around on other people's blogs and saw them saying how good it was and I always thought it was just all hype. I don't know why since I'd never properly looked! I thought it was all just a bunch of pictures. I didn't know you could find tutorials, recipes, printables...there's all kinds of stuff on there!! If you haven't done so already, go and check it out...seriously!

This batch had a 1:1 ratio of apples to sweet potatoes by volume because I had quite a few apples past their eating prime, making this soup the ideal hiding place.
I also think it’s a mistake for schools and parents to focus solely on the health benefits of good food. Food sits at the intersection of so many important things we all deal with on a daily basis—health, yes, but also the environment, community (what better way to connect with others than over a great meal?) and social justice. These are issues that older kids can really (groan) sink their teeth into. They may not reject daily hamburgers for their own waistline or heart health, but they might be interested in the impact of meat production on the environment and start to see the links between their own food choices and larger issues. Think of it as food education that doesn’t stop at the cafeteria door.
This is when Spock sacrifices himself to save the ship.

They talk aboit the unsinkable scenario and that spock sacrificed himself because the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. Or the one.

My guess is that this would be an entirely different beer had it rested for six months before bottling. I'll buy a couple to cellar, but the quality won't be the same--the beer will oxidize in the bottle (which aren't bottle-conditioned) and though the flavors should still come together, they'll be different that a matured batch would have been.
In the meantime, reduce the beer on the heat by 50%, before cooling it in the blast chiller.
It was co-written by a couple who believe that having good sex depends on verbal communication – before, after and during the lunging and writhing. Having found their argument persuasive, the manager’s wife now insists on briefing her husband before letting him off the leash, and giving him instructions while he’s chasing and retrieving the bone (so to speak). Worst of all, as far as the manager is concerned, is a section of the book which emphasizes the importance of laughter during love-making. In the words of co-author Rich Blomquist:

This year has been one of the better ones for us financially, thanks largely to that big out-of-town project Shane's been working on. We're very thankful Shane's been working steadily, but again, largely because of that job, this has also been one of the most chaotic years we've experienced. Some days it feels like all I can do to keep up with the all changes. I need some serious down-time to figure out where I am amidst the confusion and where I want to be in terms of family, projects and goals.

OTFT seeks to eradicate these root problems by providing vocational training, in tailoring, and providing jobs that pay fair wages that allow the women to support themselves. We are working to bring industry to the rural areas that have simply been ignored. More importantly, we are also working to create successful female role models that can become agents of change in their own villages. The women in our Kadapa unit have become strong, independent females and have caused their rural villages to reconsider the potential of a woman and ultimately the potential in educating a girl. Most girls in the area are pulled out of school at Grade 5. We are trying to change that mentality.

I have been so incredibly lucky that Musicman has been able to give me the time and support I needed to figure out what I wanted and to go after it.

I’m not sure where the fascination of being scared comes from. I guess I would compare it to the thrill you get of being on a roller coaster. You know that you are 99.9% safe, but there is that small possibility that the car could at any moment fly off the track. It is empowering to fight off your most primal instinct of self-preservation and step into that roller coaster car. Your heart pounds with anticipation as you jerk slowly to the top. Clack, Clack, Clack… You see everything from a different perspective, it is eerily quiet, the crowds below are not part of your world now. It is only you and the wind. Then, whooosh… you are dropping weightless, you would scream if you could catch your breath. One big gulp of air in and….AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH. You let it all out at the bottom, only to have a few seconds to adjust your grip on the safety bar before the next drop. It is a thrilling ride, nothing beats the euphoria of making it back alive. A little shaken, but no worse for the wear. This is exactly what a good ghost story does for me.

Taxi violence broke out again during the inquiry. A man was shot and killed by unknown gunmen. No one was willing to talk about the the killings. Perpetrators are rarely arrested because people refuse to come forward with information. The inquiry failed to solve the problems and the violence continued. A similar inquiry was established in Johannesburg and KwaZulu-Natal but nothing came of it.
Occupy has also brought the simple right to assemble peaceably into the spotlight. If cops in riot gear think they can bust up nonviolent groups of demonstrators for no good reason, we, the 99%, now have more work to do.

She also seems to be settling, in her soul. She has developed trust for us as her parents to respond when she needs us and to love her unconditionally, and she is slowly expanding her exploration comfort zone. She will happily cruise up and down our stairs, tossing shoes and filling them with surprises, for up to half an hour. She can feed herself 100% independently now, including utensils (even soup!). She is a fabulous eater, and eats anything. She LOVES meat and prefers it over anything else. She is petite and delicate in stature but ferocious in spirited personality. Sometimes we call her 'Angry Bird' because she really is light and tiny like a bird, and often enough she is sooooo angry about some thing or another. She can get angry because you smiled at her, took her photo, or tickled her when she didn't want you to. Or because she can't walk when she has MY shoes on because they are too big and heavy. Or because she wanted to walk up the stairs on her own and you didn't get her telepathic mind memo regarding it. She has a new noise for "I want that." Remarkably, the noise is polite and pleasant! It is just a noise and not a phonetic sound per se, but it is phrased like a question, rising at the end. She will point and make her noise, and hopefully someone tunes into what she wants rather soon, or she will hit the floor in frustration. We do baby sign language with her, but she's not that into it. She would really rather just communicate in her own way, which is fine! The one sign she consistently uses eleventymillion times a day is 'milk.' If you don't look at her when she's communicating with you, she slaps you. Hard. Open palm, to your chest if she can reach it, or your arm if she can't. If she can manage it, she will slap your face, but generally she can't reach. She also likes to slap me while she breastfeeds. She slaps the boys all the time, scratches their faces, and pulls their hair. But sometimes, she gives them hugs instead, and once in awhile she will back her sweet little bum onto their laps for a cuddle.

In all fairness, though, I should explain…Yes, I am posting the rejection letters for poems I have submitted (and letting you see what poems they rejected). But in my defense for this little defiance, one should know that I am an editor too. I decide what gets published in Poetry Breakfast. I send out those horrid rejection letters too. Preferring to use the un-opinionated “they’re not the right fit for our journal” sort of form letter. Which only means I didn’t love your poem. It’s an opinion. My opinion. It has absolutely nothing to do with how well the poem is written. I just love it or I don’t. I send rejection letters for the poems I don’t love.

I write about a gang of Harley-riding biker witches, and of course did a lot of research with real-life bikers. I had a signing coming up at Barnes & Noble and invited them along. A few of them showed up and parked their huge hogs right next to the "Angie Fox: here today" sign. I did the scheduled reading from The Accidental Demon Slayer, and then sat back and had a blast telling stories with my real-life research buddies. Readers loved it—so much so that we ended up selling out of The Accidental Demon Slayer.

My original idea was to find piano works that were composed around the same time as the works that we were performing on the series. The nice thing was that the series began with the Op. 18 String Sextet and ended with the Op. 115 Clarinet Quintet, so I had pretty much the entire Brahms piano repertoire to choose from. At one point, Paul pulled me aside and said, “if you’re going to transcribe something from the late piano works; like the Op. 118 or 119 piano pieces, you must do the A Major Intermezzo.” And that’s how it all started – Paul’s request for the A Major Intermezzo was what got me motivated to transcribe this particular piece for the ASQ.
As the nation-state is superceded by the market-state, Bobbitt explains, we are witnessing a clash of tactical responsibilities: "What is appropriate for the market-state – with its porous territorial concepts and its responsibility to preserve the opportunities for personal development, including, of course, access to a safe environment – seems to clash with the absolute sovereignty of a nation-state taking steps it alone can determine are necessary, within its territory, to protect the nation." Of course, this is exactly what we see today in the U.S. immigration debate: an argument for the economic necessity of immigrant labor, including financial opportunity for all, vs. an argument for national border security and the protection of legal citizens.

My friend Nita and I refer to this as spiritual bypass. People use spiritual practices and beliefs to excuse the harmful things they do to others and avoid or bypass who they truly are. Gurus and priests do this unconsciously to avoid the dark aspects of their personalities. This is how child abuse and sexual affairs can occur among religious leaders. They have not dared to look at their shadows. They can enjoy their sandwiches, but while they eat, the ceiling falls down on them. Ignorance is not always bliss.

It gives me piece of mind knowing that investments such as Apple will support me until I establish myself as an indie author.

Even today, he was not bothered about her. He wanted her back because He was not happy with that girl. He thought he’d be happier with her. Why? Because she wasn’t as demanding as others. She never complained about anything or wasn’t cranky like other girls. The only support their relationship ever got was her resignation. He never understood the fact that a relationship demanded compromises from both the sides, not just one. His obsession with his own-self blinded his heart. He never realized that narcissism had no place in Love. He would never be able to understand that.
Note the lack of a personal reference to me, the vagueness of everything but the problem. Note also the really poor grammar. I was this guy’s English teacher, for heaven’s sake. He’d be embarrassed to send me anything that poorly written.

However, Apple’s dominance will gradually be eroded. By 2016, tablets sales will have grown to about 369 million units. Apple will have a 46 percent of the market and the Android camp’s share will have grown to 37 percent, as the latter platform matures.
While I think she is a very good character in the LOTR saga and does a great job breaking up the otherwise sausage-fest of a cast, there was one thing about her character that seemed a bit odd to me. While she is a very strong female character, she seems to be lost without having a man to hit on. Seriously. She develops a crush on Aragorn, but he’s all like “Sorry, Liv Tyler‘s hotter and talks less, so I’m going to make out with her instead.” When Eowyn finally realizes that she can’t be with Aragorn, pretty much three scenes later she meets up with Faramir, and is like “I guess he’s kinda cute too” and gets cozy with him.

Some may say that such a film is terrible, for it destroys human subjectivity, reducing people to mere placeholders for emotions and thoughts and words which transect them. And yet, what if such a film is also exploring the potential for new forms of subjectivity? Might we simply be fearing change? Might there not be a way to make a film like Noriko’s Dinner Table, not themed around horror, but rather, around love?
A confession: I know I gave short shrift to rap in my inventory of American music above. Rappers appear to like rum, although not as much as Hennessy. But, seriously, some rapper somewhere surely must be able to improve upon rhyming “Bacardi” and “party”:
I had had enough rejection letters to fill a small room in a rather large house! Some came back with little comments, others were just blank slips. I had hawked the first book around to several adults and lots of children and they seemed to like it. I decided then that I wanted my book out there whatever the cost so looked into self-publishing.
As a matter of fairness, the specific details of this account have been challenged, but, “In the final analysis, Erasmus probably altered the text because of politico-theologico-economic concerns: He did not want his reputation ruined, nor his Novum Instrumentum to go unsold.”[11] According to A. T. Robertson, the Johannine Comma got, “…into the Textus Receptus by the stupidity of Erasmus.”[12] Since the KJV translators based their work upon Greek texts that were founded upon Erasmus’ text, the rest of the story is history.

Retrospectively the amount of sniffery and snears directed towards The Monkees as they took their place in sixties pop society, seems almost hard to believe now given the quality of the catalogue, the pedigree of their legacy and the roll call of heavy-hitters happy to sit in with them - Jack Nicholson, Dennis Hopper, Neil Diamond Goffin/King. Oh, and then there's Brixton's David Jones having to rebrand himself as David Bowie to avoid any confusement
As a concept, Brave New World is hands-down, no-holds-barred awesome. As a novel, it’s pretty okay. There are times when Huxley’s narrative style varies so much from chapter to chapter that you wonder if the man wasn’t himself on a little soma, if you know what I mean. His characters are intriguing, though I would argue not entirely developed, and the arc of the story leaves something to be desired.

Yesterday was probably the happiest birthday of my whole life :) Luckily it was also our P-day, because the whole day was spent with one party after another! I love love love Rio Pardo....I can´t believe how much I love this area after just 6 short weeks!! The members are wonderful and loving and fun and alw. Fernanda and Rúbia made Pudim for a birthday breakfast sang and danced a Brazilian happy birthday song, Irmã Marta taught us how to make cuca while Irmão Ernesto played gaúcho music on the guitar, Presidente Rogerio made a nega meluca (amaaaazing chocolate cake) and gave me a Rio Pardo 200 anniversary T-shirt and then we finished the night with a Noite Familiar with Kátia and Carlos and almost the whole ward...with, of course, pizza and more chocolate cake. Wow....I have never felt so loved in my entire life :) The best present of the entire day, though, came at 7:00 in the morning when the zone leaders called with news about the transfer........Sister Corrêa and I are both staying in Rio Pardo! :D I am very happy and excited for another transfer here in this amazing area with an amazing companion!!! We´re both ready for another transfer full of joy and miracles here in Rio Pardo. What a wonderful wonderful day!

A friend of mine who studied child psychology explained that the mind of a child is very delicate, hence the violence witnessed by children in 2008 may manifest later in the years. For example disruptions at grade 2 level can manifest at grade 7 and therefore it is very possible to get a 0% pass rate. It is fact that most of the violence took place in rural communities and it is no surprise that rural schools have the highest levels of failure rates. I do not want to under play other factors contributing to this failure but political violence remains a key factor.

Elizabeth: The Golden Age - I'm happy that this actually (finally) got made, and even if it doesn't hold up to the original, it should be pretty engrossing (and the Spanish Armada special effects look very cool). Maybe Blanchett will finally get the Oscar that Paltrow stole from her ten years ago!

I’m a bit torn on Yakuza: Dead Souls. On one hand, I love these characters. I’ve always been down with Kaz and his orphanage, and just got behind Akiyama in Yakuza 4, so I’m excited to see them tossed into an insane situation. On the other hand, the gunplay looked pretty stiff. It seemed like even the guy demoing it for me was having trouble turning and getting his gun in the perfect spot. I’m all for a Yakuza game with zombies, but I want to make sure it’s fun and easy to control.

Guitar learning has been really an empowering experience for me and helped me overcome depression. I’m no Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, Yngwie or any virtuoso to advice but guys don’t let the passion within you die. I might be oversaying it but I feel, The Death of Your Passion is annihilation of your existence. And as James Hetfield said a lifechanging quote for me, “Dream Big and Dare to Fail!” cherish your dreams, passion. Let the voice of true you become stronger and stronger.

And here is another owner's in-depth review.
But the emptiness didn't last long. The temporary furniture arrived two hours after the last of ours left. So don't feel sorry for us. We can stay in our own place until we leave. It's home but not, perhaps part of a bigger plan to help us cut the emotional cord.
So baptism was on my mind this weekend, but not particularly in a personal way. Then I got a lift back to London with a friend, who dropped me off at Gunnersbury station. Then I find that the tube is closed for the weekend, and there is the dreaded bus replacement service in its place. I try to ‘relax into’ the ordeal, as I’m in no rush to get back. The bus comes, and it drops everyone off at Turnham Green station to pick up the District Line. And there, directly opposite the station, is the Anglican church where I was baptised 45 years ago!

After years of living inWashington,DC, I have made it a point NEVER to use this as an opening question unless occupation became a part of the conversation. I refused to be the unoriginal young professional that could think of nothing else to open a conversation with “So, what do you do?”

The stories were ended prematurely by the management at the Radio Times. Originally they were planned to last for 60 issues with the fifth story to have the title Deceptions (and an unknown title for the final 10 parter). Instead, Coda was produced to tie up dangling plot elements, rather abruptly.
I found the section on determining your face shape pretty interesting. Once you learn what shape your face is - oval, square, triangle, etc. - you can figure out what 1950s hair styles, makeup techniques, etc. work for you. Although some of the information is a bit "dated" for today much of it is still very useful, especially for those who want to recreate the look of the 1950s.
And then…there are those property tax statements I mentioned.
I have been thinking a lot lately about identity. Specifically my identity as a writer. I rather stumbled upon writing, I am unlike many of my writer friends who have "always written". It started for me about 6 years ago. I can actually name the incident. My daughter was in kindergarten and we had been to see a local production of "The Wizard of Oz" with her class. It was quite an experience. I waved goodbye as she got on the bus to go back to school and headed to the parking deck to get in my minivan to go back home. Pulling out of my parking space I was suddenly hit with a compelling thought about the whole experience. I quickly jotted down a couple of phrases as I waited in line to leave. I went home and wrote my piece. I showed it to my husband who encouraged me to submit it to our local newspaper. I had previously written a letter to the editor concerning school budgets that had been published and gotten a fair amount of attention (including coffee with a then state senator), but I didn't consider that "writing". I wasn't sure about doing it, but I sent it off and amazingly it was published with no editing. Thus began my writing "career". Since that time I've written a couple more letters to the editor, had a faith piece published in same newspaper, joined a writers group, started writing two different novels (one middle grade book and one chick lit), and started this blog (not in this particular order). And yet, I rarely introduce myself as a writer.
To prove reasonable suspicion, the prosecution argued that the police detective who stopped Foster knew him, and knew he had a criminal record; that the detective saw Foster speaking with someone else in the car; and the detective saw Foster gesture with his hands in a "frenzied" manner.

When I think about the contents of my cup I am encouraged by the Father because He has filled it. The contents make up the life I live. There are times my cup overflows with sweetness and joy and I am filled with delight. Other times my cup is brimming with the trials of this world. The Lord allows it all. He pours into us what we are capable, in His strength, of handling. There is not one moment in my life that I do not trust that the Lord is perfect and sovereign. I may stumble in my thinking…I may pause in my trust. But, when it is all said and done, I trust the Lord.
Power Distance scores are high for Latin, Asian and African countries and smaller for Anglo and Germanic countries, and correlates with the use of violence in domestic politics and income inequality. Uncertainty Avoidance scores are higher in Latin countries, in Japan, and in German speaking countries, lower in Anglo, Nordic, and Chinese culture countries. UAI scores correlate with Roman Catholicism and with the legal obligation in developed countries for citizens to carry identity cards. Individualism scores are high in developed and Western countries, while collectivism prevails in less developed and Eastern countries; Japan takes a middle position on this dimension. Individualism is correlated with national wealth and mobility between social classes. Masculinity Index is high in Japan, in some European countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland, and moderately high in Anglo countries; it is low in Nordic countries and in the Netherlands and moderately low in some Latin and Asian countries like France, Spain and Thailand. Masculinity scores correlate negatively with the percent of women in democratically elected governments. Long-term orientation scores are highest in East Asia, moderate in Eastern and Western Europe, and low in the Anglo world, the Muslim world, Latin America and Africa. Long-term orientation is correlated with school results in international comparisons.

Understand that most voters and candidates are only minimally informed, or worse, misinformed about the criminal justice system. In particular, they do not understand that prison costs roughly $38/day for each of our 150,000 prison inmates and that this equation drives Texas' criminal justice budget. They do not know that nearly three times as many offenders currently are supervised on probation for around $1.50/day. If budget cuts weaken probation and thereby increase prison admissions, every new inmate added to a prison bed will cost taxpayers 25 times more than would have been spent to supervise him on probation.

In my nearly five years of being here in the seminary, I came to love what I have put myself into not the kind that is being forced into me. But I truly felt the love for what I wish to be and what I wish to do. I can say that I came to love our mission. The pangs of truth sank deep and then I saw myself, butterflies in stomach, that I am in love and I can say that I can do it. I can endure for my existence came with a meaning attached to it. It fueled my journey into the unknown. This is the lesson I can leave to all of you. I dare say, stay in love, explore what you love, love many if not all but stay truly in love not just for our mission but the trials and pleasure that comes along with it. Love the chance that you can make a difference, love the fact that you could be of help to the Apostolate. Love for it is what we are made for. Love for it will define who we are, what we are, and who we will become.

It had been a l-o-n-g week....hubby had been gone for work all week and Wee One had been sick (and I myself hadn't been feeling 100% and also completely uninspired) so I was really looking forward to Friday night and my curry feast that I was planning. Of course as is always the way for me when I make a curry, I find it absolutely impossible to only make a curry.....there is always rice (naturally) but I always have to make some other things to go along with it. This time I made one of my favourite side dishes to have with curries – my Spiced Green Beans. It had also been my intention to try and make my own Naan bread for this occasion but time got the better of me so thankfully I had a packet on standby which I had recently bought! Next time though.....

However, I want to end up with some critical notes. What I do not quite understand is why the title is not displayed in English and why the Dutch text in the book is only partially translated into English. But who cares, after all, the book is about seeing the pictures. Also I think that the price of € 29, – is a bit to high, considering the fact that the book was composed with the support of sponsors.
Once in a while, my parents would take us out for Chinese food and I would refuse to eat it. I remember looking at their plates of chow mein and chop suey and saying "you can't tell what's in there. It could still be alive, for all you know." So my parents would get me other take-out food and bring it with us to the Chinese restaurant. While they were eating their veggie dishes, I was dining on White Castle (although I did like the fried noodles but no duck sauce please).

Today I went out for a long-ish jog. I did one of my favorite loops where I run from my neighborhood to one of the others in the city and back. For those who have never been here, Pittsburgh is quite a hilly place. This run in particular has a pretty steady incline for over a mile. Today, it went so well! It's so easy to get tired and give up when you're running up a never ending hill, but today I just kept thinking "One foot in front of the other." Before I knew it, I was at the top, and I was lucky enough to spend the rest of the run going back down. Phew! Toward the end of the run, I even got the elusive runner's high where I really felt like I could go forever. It's almost like taking a step is effortless. Your body just does it without thinking and you could run faster and further than even before. Love that feeling!

An occupier’s right of residence can only be terminated if such termination is “just and equitable”. Further, the courts will not grant an eviction order unless the owner makes alternative accommodation available – Chapter IV, Section 9. What represents “suitable” accommodation is also set down in the Act, and in most cases the farmer is unable to find this “suitable” accommodation and he simply buys a piece of ground somewhere else and gives the occupier building materials with which to build a house.
The Queen’s Lover by Francine Du Plessix Gray is a beautiful story that blends historical detail with fiction telling the story of Marie Antoinette and her love affair with Count Axel von Fersen.

2003 is the year that the Iraq war started as well. It took about a year for the tax cuts and rules to settle into the economy, but you can see the results.

Until in walks old family friend Mitya (Oleg Menshikov), a flamboyant prankster and handsome young man who immediately triggers major alarm bells between Kotov and Marusia. With vague allusions and eerie shots of Marusia's scarred wrists, we learn that Mitya was more than a family friend - on the contrary, he once enjoyed Kotov's privileged position as Marusia's great love and beloved scion of the family clan. But after indeterminate misadventures during the revolution and civil war, Mitya lost that position. His return now is both unexpected and mildly threatening; his strained smiles hide an eerie malice and a deep self-loathing. Things take a turn for the worse when we learn that Mitya's arrival is not merely a personal visit.

The run was 7.15 miles in 55:59. Although I was stiff all day (especially my quads), things started to loosen up within the first mile. After using the first mile as a warm up, I was able to run the next six miles close to my target marathon pace, with the last mile well below my marathon pace.
Being a gardener, I can’t help but talk about the weather. Here in Kingston, it has been an unusually warm and dry spring so far, after an unusually warm and dry winter.

I am happy to see the Fawn Lily (Erythronium) blooming, and sad to say the Carolina Spring Beauty (Claytonia) doesn’t look like it will flower this year.

Being a father of such child of fifteen years old and a voluntarily social worker of AASRA SPECIAL SCHOOL AND REHABILITAION CENTRE, I have a bitter experience how this lot is neglected especially by our state and centre government.
I want to take this opportunity to welcome Bobbi Sheahan and Kathy DeOrnellas, Ph.D. to present a carefully prepared introduction on autism for the rest of us. This should come as a welcomed post to my followers, many of whom take an active interest in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Asperger. This is a cause I have taken an active interest in for several months. I consider this to be a special presentation.
The next book I wanted to read also came from that list, Karen Russell’s Swamplandia!. However, it was checked out and had a 7 person waiting list. I joined the list. This is risky because I could be in the middle of a book when it become available and then I have to decide, do I stop what I’m currently reading, and start that one or do I let it go, only to have to join a long waiting list again. Now I am number 2 on the list, which means, at the max I have 28 days until it is my turn, but those people could be speed readers or not even want it at all and I could have it much, much sooner. I decided to risk it, checked out another book, and will read like crazy. I figure I have at least 3 weeks.
Your right Jamie, I DO own a German made vehicle - I have no excuse except to plead insanity - by far THE WORST vehicle I have ever owned! Serves me right. If it counts for anything, I also bought it 4 years used and I DO own a Chevy s10 ss and a Saturn compact as well.
Classes will be held entirely in China and conducted in English. By visiting key institutions and facilities related to international trade, investment, and finance in and around Shanghai, students will gain a more detailed understanding of international economic issues as they connect with the most rapidly emerging economy in the world today. During the two weeks in Shanghai, students will meet with key policymakers in the government, specialists in international trade and finance issues and members of the Chinese business community.

I played through the entire Beta both in co-op and single player. Personally I will probably play through the game as solo player because I like the slow pace and taking my time. When I was in groups it seemed like we had the go-go-go attitude that was prevalent in early WoW Dungeon Finder groups. The faster pace of co-op does not lessen the experience of Diablo 3, though. This game is both unforgiving and quite rewarding. Just like in science, everything you do in D3 has a reaction. Those reactions form the experience you will receive from Diablo 3.

You can check out the religions of the world. Their gospel is not the simple gospel that Christ died for our sins. It is a mixture of demands from the Law of Moses. When they add one or more works to the preaching of the cross it nullifies that message of the cross and grace is no more grace.
The tale of Satyavan and Savitri is recited in the Mahabharata as a story of conjugal love conquering death. But this legend is, as shown by many features of the human tale, one of the many symbolic myths of the Vedic cycle. Satyavan is the soul carrying the divine truth of being within itself but descended into the grip of death and ignorance; Savitri is the Divine Word, daughter of the Sun, goddess of the supreme Truth who comes down and is born to save; Aswapati, the Lord of the Horse, her human father is the Lord of Tapasya, the concentrated energy of spiritual endeavor that helps us to rise from the mortal to the immortal planes; Dyumatsena, Lord of the Shining Hosts, father of Satavan, is the Divine Mind here fallen blind, losing its celestial kingdom of vision, and through

This past month I participated in a blogger pen pal program. You can read about it here. Pretty much it’s a fun little exchange of food gifts that helps bloggers connect with each other.
A week ago, I downgraded my Netflix account, dumping the streaming side of the service. There simply isn’t anything on there I want to watch anymore. Or rather, what there is I’ve either seen, could easily watch elsewhere, or am only vaguely interested in watching. And by “vaguely interested” I mean if I had literally nothing else to do. I’ll continue to be a disc subscriber to get the movies I can’t get at a Redbox, but it is amazing how completely worthless the streaming service has become.
“Go ahead.”
Now I was in the Ho-hum category actually. Writing 50,000 words in a month was to me no challenge and in fact I started the competition a week late and finished with 60 000 thousand words but it was really fun (thanks in a large part to the spontaneous group that sprung up on G+ of other NaNoWriMo participants) and I did write a novel (at 61 000 total finished word count after edit I’m going to say novel and not novella – Google the difference)

I’m 34 years old. It’s been 23 years since my grandfather died, since I saw my father cry and when I first realized the importance of outside role models and teachers. I didn’t always show it, but that sting in my stomach never went away when I played for Coach. My attitude got worse, he stayed the same and it would be years until I would fully realize his role in my inner development. Sometimes I wish I had understood the importance of learning lessons as an eleven year old, but only a few get to hear the echoes of those lessons decades later. Fewer actually listen. I can still hear that afternoon quite well. Sitting with me beside that tree are my father, my grandfather and my baseball coach. Call it an omni present pre-game pep talk.

She had bustled into the room somehow brightening it and bringing it to life merely by walking in. It really was that easy for her. She never believed him but he would have fallen in love with her even if she hadn’t had a breathtaking smile. There was something about her that he found soothing and exciting at the same time. Words failed him when he tried to explain it to her but it was as if he simply breathed easier when she was there.

The other day I was deveining shrimp because I’m an idiot. Most people realize that you can buy shrimp fully de-shelled and deveined. I suppose I did realize this, but then I saw the fully intact shrimp and the ultra cheap price attached to them and I lost all sense. I thought, “Oh, wow, all I have to do is take the shells off of these shrimp, in order to save an entire 3 dollars on this massive quantity of expensive little buggers.”

For instance, one of my patients, in computer graphics, kept hammering his wife with a poor-me attitude about how he always got stuck with boring projects at work. Instead of trying to improve the situation, he just kvetched. She started dreading those conversations, and diplomatically mentioned it to him. This motivated my patient to address the issue with his supervisor, which got him more stimulating assignments. Similarly, whenever I slip into vampire mode, I try to examine and alter my behavior or else discuss the particulars with a friend or a therapist so I can change. Don’t hesitate to seek assistance when you’re stumped.
Hunger Games? Well, a masterful job, the campaign was extremely well plotted. I am in awe. I can imaging the conversation here was more like, We are going to make this big, really Big, We can do this, and that. etc. I love the plan executed to perfection.
I was reading an article about ‘real things Portlanders do that are actually weird’. I had so much fun reading it! I should really look it up and share it!!!

Even for 10 minutes of sunshine! Hahaha

To all the people who say things like this:
In these lines, the narrow gap between the poor and the wealthy ones is clearly shown by the lucid images employed by Omigbodun. The unfriendly streets that harbor men of the underworld as they chase us around, asking us for the little pennies received after so many years of working under irresponsible leaders. The Issue of National cake that holds them in Abuja and the incognito promises from our leaders. Still, tears of loss and bloodshed manure our land as these men perpetrate their evil deeds. Also, we have the issue of the black men with howling sirens without any functional dreams of curbing these social vices. Yet, we are in the nation encapsulated with trepidation of tomorrow as there are no dreams to hold.
The article didn’t go to the logical conclusion - that outside is the biggest ceiling of all - but it did say that when we have scenery with greenery and nature we think better and differently. Research in 2000 followed some families who moved house, and looked at the attention ability of the children: those surrounded by more greenery after the move appeared to do better on a standard attention test. Other research showed that students had better mental focus when they had “natural” views, compared with those looking onto buildings.

Heat up 2 table spoons of vegetable oil in wok. Stir fry the onions until fragrant. Add in the French beans. Fry until the beans are cooked. Add the eggs and then the soya sauce. Remove the cooked dish from the wok and put in a bowl. Turn it over and put it onto a plate, so that the dish will take the shape of the bowl. Garnish with cilantro and serve with white rice.
This 7" is much better than the band photos would lead you to believe. The band comes across looking somewhat glam metal in these photos but in reality this is a nice thick rocking slab of catchy metal leaning towards the power metal side of things and reminding me of the 80's metal band Medieval or even Tyrant (CA) with the high pitched screams in the excellent "The Power".
One thing I do know about book fairs after four years of business and over a dozen book fairs under my belt is that book fairs are seldom predictable. Great sales one year can be followed by slow sales the next and then suddenly return to a level that I consider “good”. I’ve made profits on many more fairs than I’ve suffered losses, so I continue to do them. I will, in fact, be back at the Sacramento Antiquarian book fair when it is held again in September. Relative to larger fairs in larger cities, it is an inexpensive fair to do (i.e. if I take a loss at an inexpensive fair close to home like Sacramento, the loss is less than when I have paid more for a booth and travel at a larger fair) and there are usually good books to be found for resale there. Besides, I enjoy the company of my fellow booksellers and some of the regular fair-goers too much to skip it. We had two wonderful dinners on Friday and Saturday night, and the food and company definitely made the fair worthwhile.
What a great celebration! I will always be proud of my girls, how they have grown, from little kindergarten Daisy GS to high school senior Ambassador GS, and become such fine young responsible women! Good luck to them in all their endeavors, thanks to the devoted Moms. It’s been an amazing journey and a true pleasure!

Umno is owned by vested interest and to keep these interests in power, the only way is to continue on a path that is illogical, a path of racism, religious bigotry and backwardness totally out of sync with the rest of the world. The Malays know it. The thing is, will they still give Umno one more chance. It’s much like giving an addict another shot of heroin just because you feel sorry for him. But should you?
This year, I'd like to go to Bald Head Islands in the Outer Banks. (They have blue herons!!!) I wish to take my daughters there for a week so we can help with the turtle babies, climb the lighthouse, splash through the tidal pools and paint the sunrises and sunsets. That's my wish!

Straatligkinders, made what was already apparent and obvious – crystal clear. Music was the path Bouwer was meant to tread on. Regarding his journey with Straatligkinders, “Straatligkinders was an amazing time in my life. I learned so much about the music industry, the dynamics regarding friendship and everything that gets mixed – up in between, within a band. It was a journey full of highs and lows, good times and bad times. It was a journey driven by passion… that at times maybe drove you a bit too far.”
Those who fear the consequences of ‘tampering with nature’ object strenuously to such experimentation. On the other hand there are too many hungry mouths in the world for us to avoid such agricultural experimentation. Cross your fingers and hope that this new variety of good grain and vegetables will actually build muscles faster, make human beings live long. Who knows? GM may have bad effects but can good effects be ruled out. And if this new grain makes human beings sterile, is this entirely a bad thing? Can the planet not do with fewer homo sapiens? I wonder what the stance of the Catholic Church will be on this.
Sitting in the car park of a well known supermarket in Hexham one day during the Christmas holidays (supervising J whilst Francis and the 11 yo did a hit and run on said supermarket,) I took time to reflect on the collection of buildings surrounding us. From the garish late 20th century buildings immediately adjacent me to the clock tower of the Abbey peaking above the 18th and 19th century cluster of shops and homes. That led me on to wonder about the history of the town and I hit on the idea of this post.

These photos were all taken in my birthplace, London, and also around United Kingdom since my parents stayed there for more than 10 years to further their studies there.

He is one of those interesting people who are a just joy to meet, although I suspect living his life was considerably less enjoyable than sitting back and hearing about it. He is a dyslexic ex-con, who was smoking and selling hash from his bedroom when he was 12. By the time he was 16, he had moved on to ecstasy and became involved with local gangsters. He carried knives and guns, took steroids and worked out at the gym to build himself up. By 17, he was helping alleged gangsters collect debts – related to money-lending, drugs, anything.

The developers compound this by making the capital city of the Guardians protected and unable to be entered without a lot of deaths on the side of the Defiant. Yet the capital city of the Defiant is easy to walk right into. And many Guardians do so, picking off low-level characters. I have seen Guardians pull Quest Givers and kill them just to make it difficult to do Dailies. They kill Merchants and anyone not paying attention to what is going on. Now this being said, when tickets go in about the imbalance, the reply you get is a form letter that makes me feel that this is working as intended. This was reinforced with the last World Event Patch. They actually made ramp that brought people to the back of Meridian, taking away the small challenge it was to jump the hill.
Harriet Harman the, (in the circumstances) somewhat ludicrously titled “Equalities Secretary”, admits that her proposed Bill to enforce equality in the workplace will in fact lead to discrimination against white males saying “You don't get progress if there isn't a bit of a push forward.".

My dear Veronica, I am very aware of the depth of pain you are feeling as so many reports of the Great Deception come to you from so many different sources. I know that it is hard to understand how such people have been able to hoodwink so many for so long. The problem is that people only see what they want to see. Unfortunately, the time has come when they have no choice. It is time to see things as they are, not as they would like them to be.

There is one more interesting thing about dolcetto and the Italian mindset when it comes to best enjoying wines. In my previous post I wrote about nebbiolo, Italy’s equivalent to cabernet sauvignon. I wrote that most nebbiolos can only be truly appreciated after a long cellaring, which can be anywhere from 10 to 15 years. So what are the Italians to drink while their nebbiolos aged to perfection? In Piedmont, the inhabitants are spoiled to have dolcetto and barbera (another light, everyday red) as their table wines. I cannot begin to express how envious I am of the Piedmontese, and their utopian system for enjoying wine.
I would also like to challenge myself to have one Victorian author to focus on for each month of 2012. I will post something about that author each month and will read, listen, or watch something related to that author as well. Fellow challenge goers can join me if they would like, or can take the challenge in any direction that they choose. I had a poll in November to help pick the twelve Victorian authors readers of this blog were most interested in focusing on and the following authors were picked:
