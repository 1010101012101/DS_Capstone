øQB: Matthew Stafford, Lions - The last time the All-Joe team selected a player who passed for more than 5,000 yards and 40 TDs was never. Despite posting such numbers and leading Detroit into postseason for the first time this century, Stafford could not snap the Lions' 40-year streak of failing to send a quarterback to the Pro Bowl. But he'll fix that soon enough. Alex Smith, 49ers - He may never be as good as the man he was drafted way ahead of (Aaron Rodgers), but his team player longer this season largely thanks to Smith's playoff heroics.

Tim Tebow, Broncos - Love him or loathe the hype surrounding him, there's no denying he revitalized a team that was dead in the water into AFC West champs.

Yeah, I’m getting better. Yeah, I’m conditioning myself, but it’s a whole other story to be out there and working and sweating with the guys that we can consider family and brothers.

Sun columnist Dan Rodricks opines that pit bulls are inherently dangerous ("Pit bulls: Own them at your risk," May 1). Based on our extensive experience with the breed, however, we'd argue that your average pit bull makes a fun-loving, affectionate companion. The ASPCA Anti-Cruelty Behavior Team has evaluated dogs from many backgrounds, including a large number of pit bulls rescued in dog fighting cases. Analysis of our evaluation data shows that these pit bulls exhibited significantly less aggression toward people than other dogs.

L.A.’s offensive chemistry. The quadriceps injury, the bronchitis and the bad luck finally seem to be behind L.A. captain Landon Donovan, who scored for the second straight game in Saturday’s 2-1 win at Colorado.

ChefStable gets its credibility from the relationships built between us and chefs. Whether we succeed or not depends on how I get along with the chefs. All I can do is offer common-sense advice based on my experience. With new projects, I also make a point of bringing up the hard issues -- the "what-ifs" -- regarding the future that are easy to ignore. But each project is built on the chef's vision. The challenge is keeping the place relevant and the quality high. So far, every restaurant project we have worked on has been profitable. Each has made money in the first year.

Joey winds up on a French farm under the care of an old man (Niels Arestrup) and his sickly granddaughter (Celine Buckens), but German soldiers arrive and take the horse, enlisting him with other horses to drag weaponry up hills; the horses are treated as a disposable means of transportation, used as long as they're useful and shot as soon as they aren't.
It's well documented how poorly the Rams have done in the past on draft day. Forbes.com ranked the organization as the second-worst in draft proficiency between 2005 and 2009, and if you look back over the last decade, it's just as bad if not worse.

He divides people into "usual agers" -- those who passively succumb to encroaching enfeeblement -- and "successful agers," who strive to stay active, productive and socially engaged. His own life offers evidence that physical fitness, though no shield against ailment, can enhance whatever condition one happens to be in. He points out that when an illness or accident does occur, a person in good shape is better primed for successful treatment and healing. He likes to refer to his exercise programs as RxExercise and says, "if exercise is medicine, there appear to be no side effects."

Young's brewery, now closed, was in Wandsworth, a few miles from the Stag Brewery. I asked him for a few thoughts about the Stag Brewery and the British brewing scene 20 years ago, and he kindly assented.

Fifteen-ounce Pavina glasses and 1 1/2-ounce sake glasses from Bodum should be a hit gift for design lovers, and hopefully beer lovers won't notice the 15-ouncers are just short of a pint.

• Mike Acker, Rip City Project: But right now, the hardest part about watching the Blazers get eliminated in the first round in six games for now the third season in a row, is knowing that this team could have played better. Nicolas Batum and Rudy Fernandez were non-existent for all six games, Brandon Roy brought probably too much emotion for anybody to sanely deal with, Wesley Matthews was inconsistent, Andre Miller wasn’t on the floor at times when he probably should have been, Gerald Wallace failed to show up a few times and then we did show up he had his minutes cut short both times (more on that in a second), and LaMarcus Aldridge just wore himself out having to be the guy on offense and guard the un-guardable guy on defense.

This much is certain: The man some called "Mayor Annoyed" will be missed on the banks of the Patapsco River and far beyond. He was one of a kind — a Charm City original — both a master politician and a sometimes-difficult human being.

There's some idea that maybe a few more tough games, win or lose, might be doing the Buckeyes well at this point in the season. Last season, it was often easy.

"I know we are Arizona, but no, no, no," he said. "(The heifer) weighs a thousand pounds, and it's potentially dangerous."
In technology, size isn't always an asset, as HP is learning. One of the biggest challenges for Whitman will be to figure out how big HP needs to be. It's a key question that has tripped up a string of CEOs, from Carly Fiorina and her hard-fought battle to buy Compaq Computer, to Mark Hurd and his $20 billion acquisition spree and 50,000 job cuts, and Apotheker's poorly received plan to steer HP away from lower-margin areas of computer hardware.

In situations where the lives of others depend on your ability to lead, there is no time for bickering. Experience in making life-or-death decisions while serving in the Marine Corps has given Fletcher exactly the kind of leadership experience necessary to make difficult decisions like those that San Diego faces.

Evelyn (Judi Dench, pitch-perfect) is a vulnerable but plucky new widow who has never worked, who lost her home to her late husband's bad debts. Muriel (Maggie Smith, flintier than ever) is an ailing old racist who sniffs at a black doctor, "He can wash all he wants, that color's not coming off." Jean and Douglas (Penelope Wilton and Bill Nighy) refuse the meager lifestyle at a British rest home and buy into the luxurious promises of the "Best Exotic Marigold Hotel." Madge (Celia Imrie, funny) is on the lookout for one last (and hopefully wealthy) husband.

Ian Stuart, STM's dominant lineman, has had Padua on his list of potential high schools from the start. His older sister Margo is a junior there, so finding transportation wouldn't be difficult. He particularly likes that Padua has girls -- a benefit helping to balance out the fact that the high school has a less prominent football history than all-boys schools such as St. Ignatius or St. Edward.
Verizon Wireless had a net gain of 501,000 subscribers under contract-based plans in its first quarter, a bit above analyst expectations.

The business is still run entirely by family members. Kendele's grandmother, Florence Noto, helps in the kitchen, and Courtney Noto waits on customers behind the counter.
One recent posting advertised a private chef of 20 years named Katie, who would cater to any dietary need — and was willing to cook for vegans and carnivores alike: “Brazilian coconut dish that is just to die for! Stews, lasagna, meatballs!” With recession-chic prices — $120 for six hours and seven dishes — it appears anyone’s dietary dreams can come true.
The recession had not yet taken its toll when plans were drawn up and funding approved for the Dodgers/Chicago White Sox Camelback Ranch and Cleveland Indians/Cincinnati Reds in Goodyear Ballpark, which opened in 2009. (The Reds moved to the new facility in 2010.)

So it might be as economical (if perhaps less glamorous) to stay home and buy a Broadway Series subscription, which range from $149-$565 for all six shows. That's also the only way, for now, to get your choice of seats. Prices and on-sale dates for the individual shows have not been finalized.
“We had too many errors,” Riverdale head coach Sue Fleming said. “A team like Poly, you can’t give them that or they’re gonna capitalize and that’s what they did.”
"In 1934, he chose to play a black teenager, the son of a janitor who swept the floors at the local bank, whom he had known as a junior high school student," Smith wrote in his autobiography, "A Coach's Life."

Kasich hammered former Gov. Ted Strickland, 56 percent to 42 percent, among voters in the Rocky River School District despite losing by 10 percentage points overall in the heavily Democratic seven-county region.
The consultants recommend detectives interview officers immediately. A delay makes the bureau's policy of immediately separating officers after a critical incident potentially ineffectual and gives the appearance of allowing officers to collude, the report said.
Tannehill met with Holmgren and other members of the Browns staff at the NFL Scouting Combine in February, and Browns offensive coordinator Brad Childress and quarterbacks coach Mark Whipple attended his Pro Day last month.

John Madden might be pushing to give quarterbacks the same protection afforded punters and kickers -- namely that you can breathe in their direction, just not heavily. But until quarterbacks start wearing jerseys the color of a "Stop" sign or pass rushers record sacks only by pulling a flag out of the QB's pocket, handing the ball off has its place in the game. Handing it into the wheelhouse of a home-run hitter has even more benefits.

They also agreed on the grave danger posed by Iran's nuclear aspirations and that a policy of "containment," whereby the international community reconciles itself to an Iran capable of building nuclear weapons but seeks to limit its impact, is not an option. Both spoke of how nuclear capability would enable Iran not only to threaten Israel, but also to endanger the world's oil supply, propel a nuclear arms race in the region and supply nuclear weapons to radical factions that could be detonated anywhere, including Western countries. As President Obama said, "The entire world has an interest in preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon." And he fully understands that "No Israeli government can tolerate a nuclear weapon in the hands of a regime that denies the Holocaust, threatens to wipe Israel off the map and sponsors terrorist groups committed to Israel's destruction."

The vegetarian dolmades are excellent, with tender, creamy rice set off with just a hint of lemon and mint and the briny tang of their grape leaf wrappers.
