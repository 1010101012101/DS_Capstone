Steve Chapman is correct. Raising the minimum wage does not help the basic wage earners as the uninformed seem to think. People don't understand what happens when the government passes a law raising the pay. An employer has to raise the basic wages, but then the workers on the next level must have their pay raised to be fair, and so on. The employer then has to raise his prices. That means the cost of everything goes up. As a result, the people at the basic level of employment are worse off than before the wages were raised.

As a member of the House of Delegates 25 years ago, I sponsored legislation, which was enacted, that strengthened the maintenance of effort law, and I have long been aware of the spirit of the law that local government should use state dollars to supplement, not supplant, county funding.

Clearly, my administration has a responsibility to adequately fund all agencies of county government to ensure that the quality of all governmental services is maintained.

That’s not because the controversial emcee’s raps are outrageous, or profane, even though they are. It’s not because he’s got anything to say about the moment he’s living in: as silver-tongued as he can be (and he sure can be), when he tries to hold up a mirror to the times, he can’t see beyond his own sheepish reflection.

Voltron, who claims to be a defender of the universe, could only bend at the waist and wave his arms around somewhat. The massive costume, about 7 feet tall and built in Toronto for $10,000, had been commissioned for World Events Productions, the St. Louis-based animation company that owns rights to the cartoon robot. Voltron's handler, standing nearby to make sure Voltron didn't topple into anyone, explained that the guy in costume was "someone we work with named Wes. He's been told not to talk, just defend the universe." Wes could not go to the bathroom; he had to hold it in all day. When a reporter shouted into the costume, asking if Voltron, defender of the universe, has health insurance, Voltron shifted uncomfortably.

Soon the chum has formed an oily trail across the water. Sea gulls begin to dive into the water for bits of the fish, but they are the only life the crew spots. The reels are silent; the rods stiff, but not strained under the weight of a fresh catch.

The day after Jon was born, a doctor told Jon's parents that the first question for them was whether they intended to take Jon home from the hospital. Nonplussed, they said they thought that is what parents do with newborns. Not doing so was, however, still considered an acceptable choice for parents who might prefer to institutionalize or put up for adoption children thought to have necessarily bleak futures. Whether warehoused or just allowed to languish from lack of stimulation and attention, people with Down syndrome, not given early and continuing interventions, were generally thought to be incapable of living well, and hence usually did not live as long as they could have.

Norquistism, allied with the Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush administrations' lack of concern with spending and deficits, led to our present economic discontent. Tax limitation does not "starve the beast" if spending and borrowing are expanding it. Worse still, as Professor Martin Daunton of Cambridge has demonstrated, tax phobia impairs the ability of governments to borrow at reasonable rates. Britain, throughout most of its modern history, has carried debts that are huge in relation to national income without impairment of its ability to sell bonds. This is due to the willingness of chancellors and parliaments to raise taxes where necessary. When that becomes questioned, credit downgradings and enhanced borrowing costs swiftly follow.

Personally, I hope the Browns take Claiborne. Everyone keeps talking about how this is a passing league and what better way to play in a passing league is there than by having two top-notch corners? That would mean more turnovers, more three and outs, better field position, and more time for our offense to be on the field wearing out the competition's defense. Claiborne is rated HIGHER as a corner than Patrick Peterson and he won defensive rookie of the year last year!! "

One of the observations I hear most from those new to wine tasting is that they often detect aromas that are far removed from what they perceive a wine should taste like. If a red wine displays notes of coconut, grilled almonds, cloves, smoke, toast and sometimes bacon, they hesitate, not quite believing what they are smelling and certainly not trusting their own judgment. It is only when the expert identifies these flavors that they smile in recognition and agreement.

Yet is it conceivable that the unforgettable Stan the Man has been forgotten? Or shall we say neglected? Vecsey posits that it is so. That, in a vague, inexplicable way, Musial is not idealized in the same way as the game's greatest greats. That, somehow, his stature has shrunk like St. Louis itself, a metropolis of more than 850,000 back in 1950 when fans flocked to see the Man but as of the 2010 census a city with a population smaller than that of California communities like Santa Ana, Bakersfield or Fresno.
Reigning world champions get a free pass into the IAAF championships. That explains why decathlete Trey Hardee is competing only in selected individual events in Eugene, and why sprinter Allyson Felix, who won the 2009 World Championship in the 200, only will run the 400 here.

Instead, McCaskill is, at least, hoping her choice of scenery will convey voters that she shares their concern. Although if middle-class voters listened to her pitch, they'd hear it was more about others paying more, instead of drivers paying less. (That's why, astutely perhaps, she called her spring swing Fighting for Fairness, rather than, say, Battling for Lower Gas Prices.)
Another scenario to explain to him is that if he is not making the best grade he could in this specific class, doing well with the novel assignment would hopefully help him get a better one.

Hey, Al: It doesn't sound as if he was ready to compete coming off rotator cuff surgery last year with the Dodgers. I'm not saying this happened, but there are cases when a player will take a physical, fail to pass it and the parties quietly agree to go their separate ways.

It's the highly ritualized kiss that then-President Jacques Chirac places on Sciolino's hand when the longtime New York Times correspondent arrives to interview him at the Elysée Palace on the eve of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, a campaign the French were opposed to. It's the story line that Charles de Gaulle used to rally his people in the wake of World War II as he created an image of a gallant France rather than one that had collaborated with the Nazis. It is, equally, an engaging dinner party guest who "might be gifted at caressing with words, at drawing people close with a look, at forging alliances with flawless logic. The target of seduction — male or female — may experience the process as a shower of charm or a magnetic pull." No physical contact required.

Not every good story involved scary woods, but a novel about a family that quotes Shakespeare does have an inherent risk: putting your prose next to the Bard's dialogue could just serve to remind the reader that you're no Shakespeare.

"I'm not like the guys that you see in most bands," yelps Ezra Furman in his best Gordon Gano voice, "because I hate everyone and I don't want any fans." While Sheff spins a web of imagery and allusion around his characters, Furman sprays his poetry straight at the listener like a kid with a can of Silly String. His singing and writing is rambunctious and restless, but his mad desire to cause friction is a mark of how much he cares. His Judaism, which is as deadly sincere as his animus, manifests as a search for the numinous that "Mysterious Power" leaves unquenched. The album peaks with closer "Wild Feeling," one of the few songs of any year that genuinely deserves to be called Dylanesque.

Before we go there, though, an interesting note to share about the power players involved in Portland: While team president Larry Miller is the front man for owner Paul Allen, league sources say Allen's long-time confidant and member of the team's board of directors, Bert Kolde, is the Wizard of Oz in this process -- one of the most influential voices around who joined Allen and Miller in interviews the last time they tried to fill this job a year ago. • NBA.com's David Aldridge thinks the Wizards should hire Nate McMillan and wishes the Blazers "would just give their general manager's job to Chad Buchanan": The Blazers' collapse this season no doubt reflects poorly on Buchanan; Portland gambled and lost in trading Andre Miller for Ray Felton, and the team was rocked when Brandon Roy retired and Greg Oden suffered one last knee setback that led to his release. But those injuries weren't Buchanan's fault, and he was able to engineer the deal that got Portland a potential top-three pick in the 2012 Draft from New Jersey for Gerald Wallace. Nobody's a harder-working bird dog than Buchanan, and Portland is in need of front office stability, not another new face that has to prove himself to Allen and his people.

It was a great year if you love to be scared between the freaky/kinky "American Horror Story" and the lumbering ghoulishness of "The Walking Dead." Plus fantasy nerds finally got a place at the table with the outstanding "Game of Thrones."
The rules for the presidential election will be identical to those in place for the March primary, when HB 194's provisions were held in limbo due to a referendum campaign aimed at overturning the law.
Since hundreds of anti-greed protesters descended on a park a block from Wall Street this fall, they have faced arrest, sleep deprivation, no bathrooms and rainy weather. They've had their backpacks and iPods stolen and their food tent invaded by freeloaders and tourists. But a downpour Thursday night followed by frost Friday was a reminder to even the most dedicated occupiers of what many have said will be their greatest test — a New York winter.
Fine comic performances are registered by Robert Gibby Brand and Cathy Wood as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. He's a realist; she's obsessed with getting their daughters married. Todd Carlton Lanker's take on Mr. Darcy is carefully conceived and understated, and TJ Chasteen, as the absurdly loquacious Mr. Collins, is very broad and very funny.
Last month's victory was Foust's third in the highly competitive European series. He became the first American ever to win a race in the championship a year ago, at the Portugal round, and repeated in Sweden last July.
The Indians took a 7-3 lead in the fifth, and Blake's hustle set it up. Blake, on first base after forcing Travis Hafner at second, challenged Guerrero's arm on David Dellucci's single to right.

Among the day's earnings news, Ford Motor Co. announced a profit that was a huge improvement over the record $8.7 billion loss it reported a year earlier. Without one-time gains, the car maker would have lost $424 million, or 21 cents per share. That is still smaller than the loss of 50 cents per share analysts had been expecting. Ford rose 60 cents, or 9.4 percent, to $6.98.
On a recent Saturday night, I decided to leave my Groucho glasses at home, and I forgot to make a reservation under an assumed name. The cheerful young hostess at the Classic Cup smiled and explained that although the prime patio seats perfect for people-watching weren’t in play that night, coveted deck seats out back were still available. On a coolish May evening, the idea of sitting outdoors sent a shiver down my spine. Instead, we were led to a tiny table not far from the charming fireplace and facing the street windows.

No worries for Darron Thomas and the Ducks, though. Thomas took Oregon right down the field and scored on a keeper from five yards out that made it 42-24 and gave the Ducks all the cushion they needed the rest of the way. Thomas added another rushing touchdown late in the fourth quarter that iced it.
Moreover, his campaign bases its claims on recent employment figures at three companies — Staples, Domino's and Sports Authority — even though Romney's involvement with them ceased years ago.

Some argue the 25-foot rule's inclusion has hurt businesses needlessly, as smokers can't even realistically step outside for a smoke break. Another problem: When customers violate the 25-foot rule, employees don't want to play bad cop to the people who leave their tips.
Beekeepers have reported colony losses of 30 percent to 90 percent in some parts of the the country. A 10 percent winter death rate is normal.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The 10-year security compact that President Barack Obama signed with Afghan President Hamid Karzai contains promises the United States and Afghanistan cannot guarantee they will keep, and loopholes for both nations.
It was Kotsay's fourth career pinch homer and his first since Aug. 9, 2002, at Cincinnati during his first stint with the Padres. He was signed as a free agent in the offseason for his left-handed bat off the bench and a veteran presence in the clubhouse

A few weeks ago I came home to to find two boys in our yard, and my 12-year-old cowering along the side of the house. As soon as I pulled up the boys took off, so I guessed - correctly - that they were not there for a playdate. As soon as I asked my son who they were he burst into tears. The two boys had been slapping him, telling him to go back to his "black mom", that sort of thing.
"I am not involved in what happens here (Masisi), I am an officer in the army of the DRC (Congo) and I obey the orders of my superiors," Ntaganda told a journalist in Goma who works for Deutsche Welle. "My problem is between me and my superiors that I have promised to solve it."
Suspicious, security guards searched for the bag outside the station and found it in a garbage can, police said. An unloaded handgun was discovered inside, police were notified and the man was arrested.
Well, maybe not so suddenly. After all, it's been nearly 50 years since "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" made its quiet, though auspicious, debut. Most of us know the rest of "The French Chef" story -- if not by living through those decades when Julia Child regularly beamed from our TVs, then at least via "Julie & Julia," the cinematic romp that provided millions with a shorthand opener to her storied career.

Special-needs students and those attending magnet schools will not suffer from the transportation cuts, though that is not the case for some parochial school students. Under current state law, Jones explains, public school districts must provide transportation to parochial students living within 30 minutes of an existing bus route. With Euclid High School busing at an end, many pupils attending Lake Catholic and Villa Angela-St. Joseph High Schools must now explore alternatives to bus transportation.

Outlook: Houston took several hits in free agency, losing 2006 overall first draft pick DE Mario Williams, Pro Bowl LB DeMeco Ryans and veteran offensive linemen Mike Brisiel and Eric Winston. Texans would like to find WR to complement Andre Johnson, two-time All-Pro who missed much of last season with hamstring injuries. TE Owen Daniels was top receiver (54 catches, 677 yards) and Foster was No. 2 (53 catches, 617 yards). Also need to shore up right side of line, which helped set franchise records for yards rushing (2,448) in 2011.

Prosecutors, who will make the first opening statement, charge that Ravi was biased toward gay people, and that he invaded the privacy of his roommate, Tyler Clementi, when he allegedly watched Clementi in an intimate moment with another man through a webcam on the Busch Campus in Piscataway.
Those costs could total more than $2,000 a year for some individuals.
Patients and insurance companies pay the same for a Da Vinci assist as for a by-hand procedure; the hospital absorbs the extra expense. In return for their investment, hospitals can advertise their "cutting-edge" capabilities, Makary says, attracting not only surgical patients but also others who will assume it's the best place to get any kind of care.
"As crashes are reduced and we can demonstrate that crashes are reduced, it will translate into the potential for lower premiums," Windsor said.
When the leading candidates were not insulting organized labor (many of whose ranks, in this state, include GOPers) they were competing to see who could be more contemptuous of the federal auto rescue to which hundreds of thousands of Michiganders owe their continued livelihoods.
That campaign connection came back to haunt Mayor Mack Tuesday as a $50,000 legal contact between the city and Cooper Levenson was revoked after the city attorney found it violated Trenton’s pay-to-play laws. And members of the Trenton council continue to question why Mack pushes for city contracts to be awarded to firms from outside Mercer County.

Jersey will need more from its big stats than it got in the first round — Ilya Kovalchuk (three goals, two assists) and Zach Parise (two goals, two assists). And it would be optimistic for the Devils to count on getting such great production (five goals) from the fourth line against Florida.
Journal-Constitution. Thursday was Conrad's 62nd game in the majors, and the infielder is regularly described as a journeyman.

His book goes a long way in answering those questions for all of us.
Such moments of transcendence have been hard won, however. Smith's marriage broke up in 1968 and she lost custody of her children in an ugly court battle. (She remained connected to her son, the oldest, but went for 17 years without seeing her daughters. Her son died of AIDS complications in 1997.) Having forsaken the financial security of marriage and making little work that was salable, she floated between studios for years before buying her current house in 1985, where she lives on the ground floor and rents out the bedrooms. Distraught by her divorce and drained by her work, Smith immersed herself in Buddhism in the mid-1970s and developed a serious meditation practice, later supplemented with studies in Native American rituals and yoga. Much of her subsequent work has built upon these mystical strains.

Sometimes cities, like people, need to "chill." Relax, understand that stuff happens. This particular fairy does her part extremely well. She puts smiles on faces.

Superior Court judge candidate Greg Bowes, leader of the plaintiffs, has obtained information in the past and says he can lay all the concerns to rest. Clearly, the burden of proving otherwise should be on the government recordkeepers; and they need to act with dispatch, if not on their own then under court order.

Lightning strikes Sunday morning in Kansas City, Kan., caused several fires.
Created by some of the same people behind "Undercover Boss" and "Project Runway," "The Pitch" has a lot of the elements people have come to expect in reality competitions. There's no shortage of ego-clashing and boardroom bickering. We can find characters to cheer and jeer. Each episode ends with the drama of crowning a winner and disappointing a loser. (At press time, most voters in AMC's online poll disagreed with Subway's choice for winner, preferring the losing agency's pitch by two-to-one.)

Givens, instead of taking this information with a grain of the salt he was symbolically playing with a few minutes earlier, accepts it at face value. It turns out this season of "Justified" was all about fathers and sons. Who's your daddy now, Raylan? Arlo Givens, Raylan's father, is really more of a father to Boyd Crowder, whose own father was killed by an unknown sniper at the end of the first season. Boyd didn't seem to be looking for or needing a father figure, but he sure treated Arlo with kindness and the old man returned the favor by taking the rap for the murder of Devil, which allows Boyd to be freed into the waiting arms of Ava Crowder.

Lawmakers in Washington, meanwhile, have requested that the Justice Department launch an investigation into the foreclosure document mess.
Another time, Kendall, my daughter, and I stopped by for a quick lunch. Kendall had the sopa Azteca (tortilla soup), a mixture of roasted tomatoes blended with charbroiled chicken and vegetables, at $5.50. It was big enough to take some home, and tantalizing! I had the chicken enchiladas stuffed with chicken and melted cheese and topped with their homemade sauce, served with rice and beans. I said hold the rice, and bring me doubles on those beans. Served with three tortillas – kudos to Mama! Delicious, and twice too much – I took some home.
But mention that to O’Brien, and he goes back to all the third-down work he needed to do today. He did acknowledge this is a bittersweet time for him, something he’s discussed in what he called “meaningful conversations” with Belichick and owner Robert Kraft.

Wiley def. Springfield, 3-2
This is a punishing onslaught of rage and aggression, from the time the screaming vocals and guitar come crashing in to meet the drums on the opening track, "Serums of Liao." It's a concept album, naturally, involving H.P. Lovecraft, Jesus Christ and the guy who wrote "Psycho." But following along won't make those riffs hit any harder. And the riffs may be what ultimately matters here, especially when "Bloody Knuckles" locks into a riff Black Sabbath would be proud to call their own.
Investors have been keeping a close eye on the bonds market recently, concerned that a run-up in Treasury yields will lead to higher borrowing costs and potentially erode some of the economy's progress. Long-term Treasury yields are closely linked to interest rates on mortgages, which have been rising in recent weeks.

A new year means many things to many people. For some it is a time of quiet reflection, for others it is a time to hopefully look forward to a new year full of opportunity and for others still it is a time to make sure that all of your laundered drug money is secure in secret offshore accounts. (That last one is really only applicable in Central America, southern Florida and select presidential campaigns).

"We really think that these red-light cameras should be used a last resort," said Kim. "Not just revenue for cash-strapped cities."
Fuzzy wasn’t expecting his sons back until Wednesday morning. That gave him just enough time to drive home to Bayboro, N.C., run some errands and see his wife, Hazel. A few hours later he’d turn around and be back in Cape May in time for the Lady Mary’s arrival. There would be scallops to weigh and checks to cut for the crew.

There are times when I am out of work, and need some work, and I'll be getting a series of phone calls from him. For most actors, your heart would start to pump and you'd go, "Maybe this is it; maybe I've got a job." Well, when I get a phone call from my manager, my heart doesn't go pump, it goes, "Oh, s—, I'm about to have to go do something for Oceana," which I think is one of the best things that's ever happened to my career. I haven't had a lot of fear and worry in my career, because I put all my fear and worry into other things. It's a little healthier to be worried about oceans than about yourself.
That logic might make sense if the agency had a record of success in the past for Lake. It doesn't. A check of its claims of bringing new companies and helping local companies expand shows that the "successes" didn't happen. Of course, that's likely because the stool is still broken.
Under the proposal, visitors would pay admission and board vans at the B&O Museum, then be driven the half-mile to the Poe House, which they would tour in groups of 12 to 15. Part of the B&O Museum's gift shop would be dedicated to Poe-related merchandise.
The amendment waived the application of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for any state that signs into law a single-payer health care plan. My budget-neutral amendment was passed by a bipartisan vote of 27-19. The promise of single-payer health care reform in the states constituted a safety net, if the underlying bill otherwise failed to control costs.

Back in Beachwood, Wastequip had grown tremendously through acquisitions when Buckwell arrived. He was hired to centralize payments, benefits and policies for 1,800 employees in 28 states.

Daniels had filmed campaign commercials for Sen. Richard Lugar a few days before we talked, delivering remarks on camera that he'd written himself. The two men have a relationship that stretches back decades, back to when Daniels worked in then-Mayor Lugar's office.

If St. Louis has any hope of becoming a destination for equally enduring high-tech industries, including renewable energy manufacturing, it needs a highly skilled workforce to build and service it. We know this because our labor-management organization, the Electrical Connection, travels the country to recruit these industries to St. Louis.

Other local union construction trades and contractors make substantial investments as well.
