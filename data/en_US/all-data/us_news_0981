More often than not, ordering at a non-vegan restaurant goes something like, "Yeah, I'll take the salad with no cheese and no dressing and a glass of water." But later that night at Lakeside at Wynn, a plate of bread showed up, and the server told me which breads were vegan. Then he brought vegan butter. I started with an arugula salad ($14) topped with candied nuts and sherry vinaigrette that set a standard for the rest of my trip. At this moment, the combination of the salad and the room-service menu made me realize that when it came to vegan meals, Wynn meant business.

The dance instructor, Alison Crosby, 43, stressed that this program is not dance therapy, that the essential focus of the program is the joy of dance. Her director, Lucy Bowen McCauley, was trained and certified through the Morris Dance Center in New York and passed on her knowledge of the program to Alison. According to Alison, the effects of the dance program are not permanent but often symptoms will stop for a while. She employs all the regular parts of a dance routine: the warm up, an increase in movement and speed, a dance across the floor and then the cool down. She doesn't correct dancers if they don't get the moves right, and there is no intimidation. After class she solicits feedback from participants and then incorporates those ideas into her next session.

A. Agave is a pretty sweet deal. Because it's four times sweeter than sugar, you need far less of it. Just 1/4 teaspoon (4 calories) will taste like 1 teaspoon of sugar (16 calories) in coffee or tea. Agave's sweetness comes from fructose, which your body sends to your liver for extra processing before shipping it to your bloodstream. Glucose goes straight to your bloodstream and va-va-voom! Up zooms your blood sugar. Still, agave is a refined sweetener (you didn't think they just squeezed it out of agave cactus, did you?), and fructose may increase your risk of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. So like all sugar, go easy.

I remember the pack had a crown on it, I suppose to add to the air of English aristocracy suggested by the name. The first thing my father did every morning, sitting in bed, was light one up.

Muti still couldn’t get an Italian audience to let the silence linger at the Strauss piece’s hushed conclusion.

It's colorful and very L.A. noirish, but no conscientious mainstream journalist ever has substantiated any of it -- all the supposed police and FBI investigations notwithstanding. The only topic more exaggerated than the mob and its influence is the average man's sex life.

A twitchingly fresh oyster, garnished with bits of mushroom cooked to resemble seaweed, balances on pebbles at the bottom of a glass bowl. The waiter pours a little pitcher of liquid into the bowl, which is immediately enveloped in a thick, fragrant fog. The liquid is seawater, taken from a local inlet and enhanced; the cold sea mist brings you to the shore in a way no mere taste could. Atxa is renowned in gastronerd circles for his use of ultrasound in extracting scents, and this particular dish is supposed to have engaged the talents of half a university physics department, but the effect comes off less as a technical feat than as a triumph of naturalism.

The lack of fault placed on Obama, particularly in comparison to the blame directed at President George W. Bush during price spikes in 2004 and 2005, can be chalked up to the perception of other parties involved, but the percentage of Americans who see gas prices as a major burden also has dropped. During last year’s gas price increases, 71% saw it as a hardship. Currently, that number is down to 62%.
My first, and perhaps still fondest, memory of what was then Reading Municipal-Memorial Stadium is of essentially standing in the bullpen during a game -- there was a low fence out there, but you could just hang over it and talk to the players -- when one of the Reading Phillies' pitchers blurted, "Hold on, gotta run" before dashing onto the field to partake in a benches-clearing brawl. He returned with cuts and bruises on his fist, and as the players replayed their role in the fight, I learned every curse word.

"The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass" makes you cry. I couldn't go through the pages without weeping. I didn't go through anything like he did, not for my skin color.

Similar to a tree, corals grow a new band of skeleton each year. But the skeleton records much more than just the corals' age.

There were some other dishes that could have benefited from that restraint. It wasn't too troublesome that the Udon Noodles ($9 appetizer, $17 entree) were more like thin ramen rather than the usual thick hefty noodles we expected.

Just after the attacks of 9/11, Americans passionately sought answers about what had generated such anger and hatred. In the years since, that questioning has given way to hardened lines and ideology that focuses on conflict and apportions blame. Fuller's book is unlikely to alter that dynamic. But it is a needed corrective, a sober call not to settle for historical pabulum and instead recall a past and recognize a present that is far more complicated and layered than any polemic would have us believe.

At the "Scream" auction, Mr. Meyer went on instinct. During a long pause around $93 million, the auctioneer says just looking at expert Stephane Connery assured him that a client would bid more by phone, despite the silence. "Stephane's body language wasn't the one of somebody who had resigned to not bidding anymore—he was probably hearing no, but I knew that his own instinct was telling me" otherwise, he says. Finally, after several more minutes of back-and-forth bids, Mr. Meyer read Mr. Connery's eyes and realized the client had given up.

Mickey Rooney received a silver Telluride medallion, and he heard himself called, quite accurately, America's greatest living actor. At the age of 85, less a couple of weeks, he's a globular gnome with a healthy measure of his prodigious old vitality. But vitality was only part of what he and his characters were about. As young Andy Hardy in MGM's hugely successful family comedies of the 1930s and 1940s, Mickey Rooney helped define our national sense of who we were, mixed together with what we wanted to be -- good-hearted, unaffected, God-fearing, father-fearing (up to a point) and, in a time of economic distress followed by world war, endlessly optimistic.

She understands the obstacles that were placed in front of me, and she knows that I was able to achieve what I achieved only through hard work.

Mr. Campbell's op-ed is marred by numerous false statements and a serious misunderstanding of how the power grid operates. One only need to look to Iowa or Texas, which last year produced 15 percent and 8 percent of their electricity from wind respectively, to see that adding wind to the grid actually improves power system reliability.
Aldridge had privately complained of a sore right hip for at least the past week, dating back to the Jan. 17 home game against Minnesota. When asked directly about his ailment in the past week, including after Monday's game, Aldridge denied he was injured.

Kunal Kapoor, director of mutual fund analysis at Morningstar Inc., pointed out that Citigroup and Legg won't avoid all potential regulatory conflicts by swapping assets.

Art Moore, managing editor of the Bloomington (Ill.) Pantagraph, had heard of Washington U and I guess the clippings I sent him made an impression. They were stories I wrote for Student Life. I got the job and spent the next 33 years as a journalist, four years in Bloomington, four years at the old St. Louis Star-Times, and 33 years at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

The electric Andrew Davis-Tamar Hoffs film "Stony Island" (1978) reflects this gritty clarion spirit.
Bub is upset over an amendment that creates a new, separate license for auctions of construction equipment.

Unfortunately, Seau's death was a sad and sobering indication that the league's initiative on player safety also remains an ongoing fight.
What you should know: This is Long Beach State's ninth NCAA appearance but first since 2007. Head coach Dan Monson, the son of former Oregon coach Don Monson, is taking his third different team to the NCAAs: he led Gonzaga to the Elite Eight in 1999 and took Minnesota to the first round in 2005. The 49ers fit the description of a "dangerous" mid-major, having played a killer road schedule that included games at Pitt, Louisville, Kansas, and North Carolina. LBSU beat Pitt 86-76 and also beat Xavier 68-58 at a tournament in Hawaii.

Red, pink, purple and black radishes, red endive leaves, green romaine leaves, carrots of course, and slices of ivory green fennel, along with the ubiquitous broccoli and cauliflower florets make a bright display. If you can find them, add purple broccoli and chartreuse Romaneso broccoli to the mix.
We need rules less than we need guidelines, inflexibility less than we need judgment. The whole trick in editing is figuring out when it's OK to use ain't and when it ain't.
Robbins recalls wondering how he'd begin a book he planned to write about Oregon's history when, on a deliciously warm August afternoon, he and his wife visited Silver Falls State Park. Oregonians of all stripes, ages and ethnic backgrounds filled the crown jewel of the state park system that day. They wandered through lodges and over footbridges and down trails built in the '30s by CCC workers.
A: Working with the kids never gets old. They come here with this passion to perform. I really see it as similar to what (Motown founder) Berry Gordy was doing throughout the 1960s. We're working with rough talent, not polished or experienced talent. We're training and developing that talent, and that's a labor of love.
The victories were the first for Santorum since he eked out a 34-vote win in the lead-off Iowa caucuses a month ago, and he reveled in the moment. "I don't stand here to be the conservative alternative to Mitt Romney. I stand here to be the conservative alternative to Barack Obama," he told his supporters.

“Although test scores are a part of the evaluation system, it involves more than just test scores,” said O’Neil. “Teacher reflection, detailed teacher portfolios, district goals could all become a part of the process. The key, however, is to identify measurable goals and outputs.”
Some school district officials and education consultants have raised the issue of whether high student mobility would lead a district to be highlighted in our analysis even if they had no cheating problem.

For the next three or four days, you don't have to pretend you have access to proprietary statistical information that proves your general manager is an idiot. You can wait a few days into the season before coming to that conclusion.
WASHINGTON - At least 20 foreign women and as many Secret Service and military personnel met at a hotel in Colombia in an incident involving prostitution, and lawmakers are seeking information about any possible threat to the U.S. or to President Barack Obama who arrived for a conference soon after, congressional officials said Tuesday.
Wonder how Forbes would have valued the Dodgers a month ago before the bids were known?
The parts of the plan that call for pay freezes for all police officers retroactive to Jan. 1 and a $100 monthly payroll deduction retroactive to July are unlikely to pass a union vote, Dzurkoc said. Combine that with a request to the state for $750,000 to backfill positions partially paid for by grant money, and you have a smoke-and -mirrors approach designed to provide the mayor with political cover when it ultimately fails, he said.
"We had the experience of losing our dog a few years ago," Meg Kasdan says.

Mr. Akimoto says he chose to base the group in Akiba, as it is known for short, in order to tap into growing interest in escapist products like comics, anime films and videogames that have come to represent Japan's pop culture overseas. The group takes the AKB part of its name from Akiba; "48" was added to convey the idea of a somewhat secret, prototype project in development, Mr. Akimoto says.
First, he believes the county charter requires the sheriff to have custody of all inmates, whether in his jail or at the work-release facility. Second, he maintains that if he took control of the work-release center he would create efficiencies and save money in the system. How much, he's not sure.

Obama aides worked to manage any political fallout. They said the back-to-back remarks by two top administration officials represented personal viewpoints and were not part of a coordinated effort to lay groundwork for a shift in the president's position. Obama aides also tried to use the latest flare-up in the gay-marriage debate to shine a light on GOP rival Mitt Romney's history of equivocating on some gay-rights issues, an attempt to turn a potential political problem into an opportunity.

The filmmaker also takes viewers into the thicket of legal issues prompted by the myriad appropriations of Mitch and Eddie's tapes, which, in true punk spirit, they made available to well-intentioned artists. When more-cynical forces (and, inevitably, Hollywood) came into play, however, they had to confront their own fuzzy roles in Ray and Peter's exploitation, eventually copyrighting the arguments they taped.
I left my laptop at home, due to conflicting reports about the reliability of wi-fi on the Spanish Main. My cell phone was not a factor. I'm on the "stick' em up" plan, rate-wise, and a signal usually wasn't available, anyway.

As I dropped my daypack on an unclaimed bed, Maurer instructed me to pull out anything vaguely food-like — including sunscreen — and stow it in one of the heavy metal lockers scattered around the camp. Years ago the High Sierra camps were notorious bear magnets — you could expect two or three ursine visits a night — but greatly fortified storage for food and garbage has pretty much solved the problem. "We had one bear skulking around earlier this summer," Maurer told me, "and I don't want any repeats."
My fourth graders came out number one in English and number one in math, my eighth graders came out number one in English and number one in math. And so Massachusetts is a pretty good model.
Oh yeah, that happened last year.

Many turtles are caught by accident and killed in longline and gillnet fisheries for swordfish, shark and tuna, advocates say. Such fishing is currently largely banned in the California and Oregon waters during the summer and fall when leatherbacks are present.
But for now it appears that House Republicans, led by Medina's William G. Batchelder, haven't peeled off enough Democrats to avoid a referendum on the pro-Republican September map. So what the GOP needs is time.
Page 187: Chamberlin testified that police training is to use less-lethal force only when lethal cover is available. "You put yourself in a huge disadvantage to go less lethal with a person, have it not be effective and then have to transition to your handgun or lethal. By that time, it might be too late."

Another basket by Brammeier gave Okawville its biggest lead of the game, 44-16, with six seconds left in the third quarter.
At times, "The Five-Year Engagement" veers into absurdist shock comedy, with scenes involving frostbite, smearing faces with potato salad as foreplay, and a psych experiment incorporating chicken feathers, fake blood and a gun. Some of it is stupidly funny, some of it just stupid. We also get some moments of brave, pitch-perfect quirkiness, e.g., Pratt's Alex singing "Cucurucucu Paloma" to his bride in a way that's ridiculous and touching. And a scene in which Tom's parents (David Paymer and Mimi Kennedy) reveal a number of secrets about their true selves while urging him to get his stuff together is worthy of classic Woody Allen.
“It's just a political moment,” he said of Romney’s comments. “You know there's the quality of political debate, you know, about economic policy is really terrible. It's not surprising given it's a campaign, but we have to govern in facts and, you know, the debate we should be having is, again, what's the right policies to make the economy stronger?”
AUDIENCE: Booo --

"Up," a movie about an old man and his young neighbor who fly in a balloon-powered house to South America, includes some San Francisco Bay area landmarks, including the popular ice cream parlor, Fenton's Creamery, in Oakland. Fenton's master blender Scott Whidden came up with this recipe he says will take you "Up, up and away!"
"Wait for me."
The immigrants scampered off to do what rodents do best -- make more of themselves. Their descendents gradually spread southward, adapting to fit the varied habitats they encountered. Millennia later, the great-great-great-grandbabies of the original African colonists are the furry chinchillas, squeaky guinea pigs, spiny porcupines and hog-sized capybera -- the world's largest rodent – that populate South America.
The reforms were welcomed by the New Jersey School Boards Association and state League of Municipalities.

Great Lakes Brewing Co., ABC Tavern, Le Petit Triangle Cafe, Market Avenue Wine Bar and Light Bistro have made improvements or are expanding. And the Market Garden Brewery, a $2.1 million brewpub and beer garden, is under construction next to the West Side Market.

(05-08) 11:34 PDT Darlington, S.C. (AP) --
There was a lot of agreement among the mayors present (Tom McEnery was out of town), who all thought the "strong mayor" system has benefits but wouldn't necessarily make things work better in San Jose than the current system does. District elections, introduced in San Jose in 1982, also were a good thing because they fostered better representation. And they all felt sorry for Reed having to deal with budget problems they never had.
Ditto the advice to refrain from kissing on the cheek, which was among the earliest measures -- along with refraining from handshakes -- to be recommended by authorities in Mexico.
A year suspension suggests multiple violations of the same university rule. Citing issues of confidentiality, athletic department officials would not say what rule Stoglin violated. The only offense cited in the university’s “Policy on Conduct and Ethics for Student-Athletes” and the “Drug Policy for Student-Athletes” that specifically mandates a year-long suspension is a third violation of the drug policy.

"We had a full hotel last night and we would have had a full one tonight, too," said Don Marrandino, eastern division president of Caesars Entertainment, which owns four Atlantic City casinos.

Zea, 28, has been doing comedy since 2006 but hasn't gotten any professional gigs. "The only times I've performed are here, and at people's houses," he says. He practices a little at his job. "I'll ask a woman, who's like 80 years old, 'How you doing today, ma'am?' and she'll say, 'Oh, I'm fine,' and then I say, 'Well, you don't need to brag.'" That one usually gets a laugh, he says.

The 13 youths who hunted in Renville and Redwood counties Saturday and Sunday braved rain and wind but learned a lot, including just how difficult it is to go home with a wild turkey. Minnesota hunters overall have about a 30 percent success rate, meaning seven of 10 hunters go home empty-handed each spring.
I'm tired of hearing about Clooney's broken-hearted women. I'm tired of the same scenario being repeated endlessly in our culture. I suggest 2012 be the year of the clarifying terminology.

Dear Gene Millstein: Astaire and Kelly were dancers who wanted people to see what they were doing and that they were really doing it. They may even have wanted to preserve their work in its pure state. But with people who aren't dancers by profession, the editing can create the dance. So it's not really mindless; it's carefully considered. As for "Saturday Night Fever," the story sounds apocryphal, but you're right that that is a rare case of a dancer being showcased as a dancer. When Travolta takes over the floor during the song "You Should Be Dancing," we see his whole body in most of the shots. It's not a strictly classical treatment - they cut about 15 times, and here and there the dance seems put together from different versions. But it's definitely designed to let you know that Travolta can actually do this. I should say, though, that even Travolta benefits from camera work that was more aggressive than in any Astaire movie. For example, when he and Karen Gorney dance in the rehearsal hall to "More Than a Woman," half the effect comes from the movement of the camera, which creates the sense that you're moving with them.
Earlier this month, she said on NBC's "Today" show that she wouldn't do porn. This was after she posed topless -- with her arm across her chest -- for a British magazine for a reported $8,000.

On March 3, the school district will sell this property to The 1759 Vought House, A Revolutionary War Loyalist Homestead, Inc. for the historically significant sum of $17.76. In the spring of 1776, New Jersey's Governor William Franklin, recently estranged from his father Benjamin, did everything he could to quell the rebellion in this province. In June, with thousands of British troops about to land in New York, tensions ran high throughout the Jerseys. Christopher Vought – who built this house in 1759 – and his son John Vought were friends with their neighbor, militia captain Thomas Jones. But when the local militia company refused to turn out to prepare for the defense of New York, John Vought was blamed and New Jersey’s patriot Congress demanded that he appear before them and explain the company's refusal. Instead, John led a mob of two dozen club-wielding loyalists in an attack on his neighbor, Captain Thomas Jones. This angry mob chased Jones into his house, where he hid, and his wife and children out into the yard. These loyalists were later arrested. Militia marched from Whitehouse and surrounded the Vought house late one night. When the colonel rapped on the front door with the hilt of his sword, the man they sought slipped out a window in his nightshirt and was captured. The loyalists were fined and released in early July, just as the Declaration of Independence was being read in towns across the new State of New Jersey.

Romance and the apocalypse don't seem like obvious movie partners, which is precisely why Scafaria (who wrote "Nick and Norah's Infinite Play List") chose the end of days as the backdrop for her directorial debut. "It's about epic times," Scafaria said of her story. "But I wanted it to be the opposite of the end-of-the world films of the '90s, where people set out to save the world. This is really about characters."

In 2010, Gov. Jay Nixon commissioned a panel led by business leaders and legislators from all over the state to examine Missouri's 61 tax credit programs. These programs, which reduce the amount of revenue available to the state by several hundred million dollars per year, allow businesses or investors to apply for tax credits that can be applied to state income tax bills. It's estimated that the various programs - some for good causes, others of dubious value - will cost Missouri taxpayers around $800 million next year.

It is my understanding that "Save Gladstone" is not opposed to a new library and that a "yes" vote on Measures 3-394 and 3-395 will allow the public to weigh in on funding major projects, not halt the library as many have claimed.

HIGH POINTS: The Vapur makes it easy to be a more eco-friendly traveler wherever the tap water is good to drink. It takes the hassle out of wanting water on the plane or in the airport. I carry my empty Vapur either rolled up in a pocket or attached by its carabiner clip to my suitcase. Once I clear the security checkpoint, I fill it up at the nearest water fountain. For road trips, you can fill it, then freeze it, so you have cold water to drink while traveling.
We meet Zuckerberg, played brilliantly by Jesse Eisenberg, during a withering discussion at a bar with his girlfriend (Rooney Mara) that ends with her dumping him. Enraged, drunken, he spends the next four hours in his Harvard dorm room creating a website that allows viewers to choose between two pictures of female students, to vote on which one is hotter. To do this, he has to hack into various supposedly secure accounts; this takes about as long as it takes most of us to write an e-mail.

How do you know when its officially snow cone season? Just look for the cool mint-and-white Shasta trailer with Snowy on top. Snowy is the mascot for Fresher Than Fresh, a traveling snow cone business showcasing fresh, natural syrups, such as watermelon basil, blackberry lavender, espresso and Mexican sugarcane or pineapple and serrano pepper. Snowy is the invention of Lindsay Laricks, a former creative director with a local advertising agency. Hes a smiley guy who wears child-size flip-flops, and he has an LED bulb inside his head that changes colors when the sun goes down. Snowy has become so popular that Laricks has rendered Snowys cartoon likeness on buttons, available on her website for $7 for three images. Fans can get his image on custom T-shirts sold at the trailer. Laricks recently quit her job to devote herself full- time to her snow cone business. Shes busy with special events on most Saturdays, so you can often find Snowy hanging out from noon to 7 p.m. on Sunday afternoons from May to September  in the garden at 17th and Summit streets, west of downtown. Snowy also makes appearances in front of Hammerpress during First Fridays in the Crossroads.

I don't think it was perfect in the first round. It was good, but we need to be great in order to win the first series."

Day 6: I was heading back to the office with my sandwich when I saw two youngish white guys on the corner standing chest to chest and yelling at each other. Suddenly a mildly scruffy-looking middle-aged African American man walked up to the two guys and wedged himself between them. “Hey!” he said. “It’s a beautiful day! It’s much too nice to be fighting! You guys need to just walk away.” Amazingly, they did. I introduced myself and he said his name was Tony. Then I told him about honoring my mom and that I had something I wanted to give him.

I came out of a corporate culture and I've actually had someone say to me, 'You're the most uncorporate corporate person I know.' To me, that's a good thing. It was just sort of a compliment to us. I try to keep things as organized as I can. I try to create that structure because I have so many things going on. I have this other business, the other store and I just started teaching jewelry-making outside of the state, too. I think that my employees are incredibly good at what they do. They're taking ownership without my saying, 'Do this,' because I haven't had to. They've taken it upon themselves to do that.

Cool, sure. It’s also gimmicky. And that’s the problem with all of this new YouTube-driven music so far — it relies way too heavily on cleverness, postgraduate irreverence and idol-smashing. Pop should not be anywhere near this bitter, or this jaded. Listen to the Cee-Lo song again: It turns on the juxtaposition between the ’60s-pop arrangement and the swear word in the title.

Q: Ira, I was surprised by the Frank Vogel's public criticism of the Heat as intentional "floppers."

And then there's that dance performance, "What Means This Lady?," a riff on "Twelfth Night" from members of the Leopold Group, a modern dance troupe in Chicago. It is not exactly coincidental that my daughter, Jordan, is a member of the troupe. "What Means This Lady?" looks at two of my favorite women in Shakespeare, Viola and Olivia - but in dance.

I attended the last meeting, and was amazed at the many barriers and irrelevant arguments that were mounted by those associated with the Princeton Battlefield Society, especially given the institute’s carefully thought-out and accommodating proposal. The institute has been very mindful of minimizing the impact of the proposed housing on the Battlefield Park, and it has also diligently addressed preservation concerns by conducting archaeological surveys of the whole site. In fact, the Battlefield Society’s own historical witness, Lawrence Babits, conceded at the Feb. 2 planning board meeting (when properly informed of the institute’s plans to yet again survey the archaeology of the site before and monitor it during construction) that, with that commitment, the institute’s plan was something even he could accept.

14:15 -- INTERCEPTION -- And that's what happens when the Giants can get some pressure on the quarterback. Even Tom Brady can't handle it all the time. It doesn't hurt that it was a poor, arrogant throw across his body, but Brady saw Gronkowski being covered by Chase Blackburn and thought it was a good idea.

You don't have to look very far to find the U.S. government wasting money. Just a simple glance through a few results on a search engine will reveal some crazy projects that the government is investing in. More than $750,000 has been spent to study sheep grazing in order to control weeds, according to an Internet search. The government has also supplied $100,000 for a celebrity chef show in Indonesia. The list of unusual projects goes on and on and as these projects are funded, it leaves many wondering why such endeavors get financial support while areas such as education and social security are left under-funded. The citizens of the United States are funding the government through their taxes, and just as we try to spend our personal money wisely, we have every right to expect our taxes to be spent wisely. Learning of wasteful projects and programs is discouraging and disheartening. As we find ourselves in the middle of an important election season, voters should consider the spending habits of those running for public office and require more from our elected officials.

People who used Ivory Wave say it is several times stronger than cocaine when snorted and that it "provides profound stimulation and empathy, as well as mild, yet blissful, euphoria." This sensation diminishes rapidly, however, leaving the user with a strong urge to snort again. Users get a temporary sense of an amphetamine-like high by snorting, injecting, or smoking the bath salt. After the intense high, users are left with a painful hangover.

And the salary numbers exclude some alumni who aren't willing to report their wages, a group many believe earns less than those who do disclose their salaries.

Occupation: Lawyer at his Beachwood firm
The financial meltdown of late 2008 was almost entirely brought about by government interference in the marketplace, but most media observers and, perhaps, most Americans, still view it as a failure of capitalism. The housing bubble was precipitated by a variety of government policies, from the Community Reinvestment Act, which pushed financial institutions to write mortgages in areas where most potential borrowers were poor risks, to explicit pressure on banks to lend to more high-risk borrowers, to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buying complex financial instruments whose risks were concealed, to the Federal Reserve expanding the money supply to keep the bubble expanding, creating the impression that the party would never end, then quickly curtailing monetary growth.

What is it about chocolate? It's packed with flavonoids, a plant-based chemical that's a PRO at ANTI almost everything: antiviral, anti-allergic, anti-platelet, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and anti-Alzheimer's. It's also adept at affecting cell-signaling pathways that regulate the growth, proliferation and death of cells. Megasurveys show that folks who eat the most chocolate cut their risk for heart disease by 37 percent, diabetes by 31 percent and stroke by 29 percent. How much is enough? Our favorite is 70 percent cacao semi- or bittersweet. And no more than an ounce a day, or you'll wander into the dark side of dark chocolate -- too many calories and too much fat. (Make sure it takes the place of other calories, so it doesn't add to your total.) If you want to get some of the benefits and fewer calories, even as little as a quarter ounce a day will help make your heart and other muscles stronger and head smarter. How sweet it is!
