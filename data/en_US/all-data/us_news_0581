Disputes in economics used to be bounded by a shared understanding of the evidence, creating a broad range of agreement about economic policy. To take the most prominent example, Milton Friedman may have opposed fiscal activism, but he very much supported monetary activism to fight deep economic slumps, to an extent that would have put him well to the left of center in many current debates.
NOTES: The Twins gave CF Denard Span his first day off this season, so recent acquisition Komatsu played there and batted leadoff instead. ...

Twins RH Jared Burton pitched a perfect eighth, stretching his hitless streak to 10 1-3 innings. Opponents are in a 0-for-31 skid with 11 strikeouts against him.

Health care is such vital element in the overall security and prosperity of the United States that we can't afford to ignore it. Many people, under the leadership of President Obama, have come together to craft an important piece of legislation for the betterment of our nation. Flawed though it may be, it is worthy of the effort it would take to save it. The alternatives that have been presented to this date are ... nothing.

"The range of misconduct at issue -- most especially impairment on the bench on two occasions, inappropriate public behavior, misuse of the judicial office, abuse of the contempt power and repeated displays of intemperate conduct -- demonstrates a significant lack of integrity and probity, very poor judgment, questionable demeanor and temperament, and compromised objectivity and impartiality," the committee said in its recommendation to disqualify Sasso from the bench.
Grim, yes. But that is the finding of a study published recently in the Journal of Family Psychology, and conducted by researchers from the University of Southern California.

With a median age of 41, all couples had least one child between 8 and 10 years old living at home.

Sadly, too much of the action here moves in slo-mo instead of a finger-snapping blur. Caulfield and Robbins are particularly stiff, and never fully work up the necessary carefree energy.
A key issue was casting. Creators didn't go for carbon copies. To play Girl, a Czech, they chose Cristin Milioti of New Jersey, who has a spunkier vibe than Irglova and a powerful voice. To play Guy, an Irishman, they settled on Kentucky-born Steve Kazee, with matinee idol looks and singing chops to match. (Both are nominated for Tonys, as is Elizabeth A. David in a featured role.) Kazee said he immediately threw away thoughts of imitating Hansard.

AIDS in the '80s and '90s had already mimicked a full-scale war, with just as heavy a casualty count. Only in this case, its victims were blamed by many and misunderstood by more. In my activist work with ACT UP during its peak, friends and acquaintances fell away with each week's meetings. The only advantage: We had time to adjust to the unfolding carnage. It became an accepted part of our lives, a wound you learn to live with.

In the few well-to-do districts, children are trained from birth to compete, and there are many who volunteer for the games. They're known as "career tributes," or Careers. The poorer districts resort to a lottery, called the reaping, in which the names of the tributes are pulled randomly out of a bowl. The older those eligible are, the more times their names have been entered in the reaping. And in exchange for tesserae, or the equivalent of a year of grain and oil for one person, particularly desperate teenagers can submit their names again, increasing their odds of being picked but also ensuring survival for their families.

On the more technical side, manufacturers sometimes redistribute salt so that more crystals sit on the surface of a product and less lie inside. That provides a quick zing of salty flavor in the mouth. They may use smaller salt crystals, which has a similar effect because it increases the amount of salt that actually dissolves on the tongue. Some companies are working to formulate salt crystals that don't dissolve easily so that they provide flavor but then pass through the body without having ill health effects. Many of these developments are confidential.

43. Amini Silatolu, G, Midwestern State, 6-3, 311. Got derailed by some academic issues in 2009 or likely would have played at either Boise State or Nevada. He pulled a hamstring earlier this year and that kept him out of the Senior Bowl workouts and he certainly needs to smooth some rough edges in his game, but the power run teams are going to like his potential.
After a three-day marathon of oral arguments, the nine members of the Supreme Court met in conference Friday to cast preliminary votes on the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. "Obamacare." Some commentators regard the outcome as a foregone conclusion based on the skeptical questions posed to the government's lawyers by the two Republican-appointed justices considered most likely to uphold the law — Chief JusticeJohn G. Roberts Jr.and JusticeAnthony M. Kennedy— and on the supposedly lackluster advocacy of Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr. At the risk of being accused of wishful thinking, we believe reports of the death of the law may be greatly exaggerated.

What? Oh, the identity chip is implanted in all the zoo animals. It's like a computerized zoological Social Security number, programmed birth date, gender, genealogy, medical history, etc. With a special whiz-bang device that looks like a cross between a grocery store bar-code scanner, a bullhorn and a cop's radar gun, the folks at the zoo can tell in an instant just who it is they're dealing with.

There is no doubt that Carmona, 27, has stuff that can be almost electric as it dives through the strike zone. He has also had the composure and self-belief to weather a nearly disastrous attempt to make him a closer in 2006. In 2007, he won 19 games. In the bug game, Carmona fell behind, 1-0, to Andy Pettitte, went nine innings of an 11-inning 2-1 Tribe victory, pushing through the unseasonal heat, the rain forest humidity that evening, and the midges.

The fact that Colson was "born again" into evangelical Christianity as he was about to be charged in the Watergate scandal caused much snickering in the press.

Jennifer Laszlo Mizrahi's five steps for dealing with Iran are steps to confrontation disguised as an alternative to war ("Five steps to isolate Iran," Dec. 6). Sanctions are self-evidently counter-productive as a means to stop or alter Iran's nuclear research and development when the motive behind sanctions is punishment or regime change. The premise of the sanctions — that the problem is with Iran exclusively — ignores the nuclear neighborhood that Iran lives in and our own desire to dominate the region.

That question is only answered by watching the guy over the last decade. He pops up in NBA locker rooms, and at the Nike Hoop Summit, I once saw him walk around The Palace at Auburn Hills during a NBA Finals as if he owned the building. He didn't even wear a credential. Wesley was so at ease, he went into the Pistons locker room at halftime. Later, a NBA security staffer approached him, and I watched to see if Wesley might get asked for identification.

This is a tenaciously clingy sauce. You could complain that the sauce isn't as silky as you might expect in a rose cream, but that's nitpicking. Any pasta style would work with this Boscaiola, but stick with the cheese-stuffed tri-color tortellini — Pazani presents it al dente.
Democrats are nattering on about this phony war in a blatant bid to cement their advantage among women, particularly the college-educated women that are a key Democratic constituency. It is base politics in every sense, a lurid, bottom-of-the-barrel catchphrase meant to frighten and energize an indispensable part of the Democratic coalition.
Hemple has an idea, too.
D'Antoni finally turned to Lin on Feb. 4 and the Knicks took off, winning seven games in a row and looking like a threat to the top teams in the East. But it all came to a halt when Anthony returned, reinforcing the notion that his desire to get the ball in isolation didn't fit in D'Antoni's offense that focused on pick-and-rolls and quick ball movement.
NEWARK — For Ruben Quinteros the news keeps getting worse. Quinteros, an immigrant detainee sitting in Delaney Hall in Newark, was picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers seven days before he was due to get married last month. He had overstayed his visa. Today, his lawyer received a fax from ICE rejecting his request for a Stay of Removal.
The district will also save some money from 299 teachers taking an early retirement or resignation incentive from the district. The school board voted Tuesday to grant those incentive requests. The final savings will depend on costs to recall or hire a small number of teachers to fill a few positions.

Thursday, James gave everything but a complicated handshake and a bro hug to the fans here, saying just maybe he'd deign to play in Cleveland again when he becomes contractually available in two years, and yada-yada.

In 1974, a dispute between ABC and the organizers of the Grammys led to an opening that Clark recognized as new turf for his music and television expertise. ABC had balked at the plan to broadcast the Grammys from Nashville, so the network and the venerable gala divorced. Clark and ABC filled the void with the American Music Awards. The AMAs, unlike the Grammys, judges its winners based on sales data and public surveys, which seemed to suit Clark's old "Bandstand" tradition of letting the kids grade the songs.

If nothing else, "Bossypants" should make any profile of Fey unnecessary, since it provides, in abundance, everything readers want from a story about a performer and none of the "clever" observations about food intake/absence of makeup/appearance of child art upon which celebrity profiles are so dependent. In chapter after chapter, in a voice consistently recognizable as her own, Fey simply tells stories of her life: How a nerdy but self-confident half-Greek girl entered theatrical life (a wonderful community theater, lots of gay and lesbian friends), what Second City was like "back in the day" (cultish, hard, unbelievably fun), how "Saturday Night Live" works (a chemical compound of Harvard grads and Improv people), what it's like to be a woman in comedy (harder than you think but not as hard as coal mining) or to run your own show or to satirize a vice presidential candidate when she's standing right backstage.

The former professional wrestler continues his unlikely career as the star of action-based kids' movies with "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island," which is based on Jules Verne's writing in much the same way a Big Mac is based on a filet mignon.

No, Ron, not again.
I lead a supremely conventional life in unconventional surroundings. Except for the time I passed a tiger roaming gracefully in the West 50s, free and untrammeled, perhaps an escaped guest from the David Letterman show; or the time, walking to work, I suddenly found myself surrounded by male and female models wearing — well, never mind. Aside from the odd encounter, I can easily slip into routine, which is how I like it. What interests me is a curator's lecture on a portrait in the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum. Or the exhibit of Charles Dickens manuscripts in the Morgan Library. A quiet life.

Toward the back of the shop, I held an Abyss bath sized towel priced at $65. These towels are renowned for their super absorbency. I got to touch a $4,000 Polish goose down comforter that was unlike any comforter I ever felt.

In 1940, the pair chartered a sardine boat out of Monterey for a 4,000-mile voyage to collect thousands of marine invertebrates from the teeming wealth of tide pools.

Five speckled bananas near the cash register are the only fresh fruit the store offers.

This particular Grecian formula is one that relies equally on the kind of Greek food that Greek people like (lemony chargrilled octopus; $12, crispy fried smelts with a zippy pepperoncini sauce, $9) and the Greek food that non-Greeks like (moussaka, $10; pastitsio, $9; chicken pita, $8).

plant for me two years ago when it was flowering. I put it out on my deck for the summer, and it produced a few more flowers. I brought it inside for the winter - no flowers. I again put it outside for the summer and again, no flowers. I brought it inside many weeks ago before the weather got too cool.

Should I do that again this year? Did that keep the plant from flowering? What is this white, cottony, sticky stuff?

Q: I read somewhere recently that after the triple-digit temperatures dip in the Valley, one can thrust a sharp spade all around a plant about 4-5 inches from the stem to bring renewed vigor to the plant and increase its productive life span throughout the fall.

Tracy cited Jimenez's recent comments in The Denver Post about being unhappy in Colorado last season because of lack of a contract extension and other issues he refused to discuss.

Catalina swept through the 2A-4A tournament, never allowing a team score more than 22 points in a game.

I fell for a similar scenario, to my life-long regret.

Kids are not widgets. On an assembly line, relevant skills don't vary much. Nor, generally, is the quality of the work as critical as a teacher's.

Tymoshenko has been refusing food for nearly a week and her health is deteriorating, according to her spokeswoman Natasha Lysova. Prison officials said she may be force-fed.
Third, we could learn something about finesse (or, put another way, humility) from the wines of Europe. The other day I overheard someone say about a California chardonnay, "You need a spoon to eat this wine" because it sported 15 percent alcohol and was thick with extract. His companion added, "Or a buzz saw" about the wine's in-your-face oak.

So that was that. The kid from my neighborhood never played. Or played very little. By the time he was a senior and Griese was gone, the coaches must have thought it made little sense to play a senior with no experience. Why not play an underclassman?

So devoted, his son said, that even on the Columbus Day storm of 1962, he and his wife drove through wind gusts more than 100 miles an hour to the Southwest Portland hall where a single dance student, a young boy, was waiting. They drove the child home and returned to Northeast Portland as winds blew the plate glass windows out of a car dealership on Grand Avenue.

The Lakers stunned the Spurs, 98-84, in part by crushing them on the boards Wednesday by a bewildering 60-33 margin. "When I was in high school, we had a coach who always put emphasis on rebounding. Certainly you have to play defense, but if you outrebound an opponent by a great number, it creates a lot of opportunities and you'll win a lot of games," Baylor said.
"We do not want to steal your personal information or credit card numbers.

"The word 'millionaire' was like the clap—you didn't talk about it," says Evans, who at 81 still counts in his intimate circle vintage-make playboys like Jack Nicholson, Polanski and Warren Beatty. "When money is everything, charm goes out the window." Evans differentiates between style, a good thing, and fashion, a superficial thing. "Style preceded fashion for these guys." Helmut Newton, the German-Australian photographer who died in a 2004 car crash by the driveway of the Chateau Marmont, was to the film producer "the epitome of style. He was the only person you couldn't officially invite to a party because then too many people would try to crash it. He was that much of a wonderful charmer."

Soon Atom is rising through the ranks toward a showdown with the towering champion Zeus, who is owned by a Japanese gazillionaire and a Russian hottie who recall the multicultural villains in countless underdog movies.
The American people expect their Government to enhance security without undermining their privacy and civil liberties. Without clear legal protections and independent oversight, information sharing legislation will undermine the public's trust in the Government as well as in the Internet by undermining fundamental privacy, confidentiality, civil liberties, and consumer protections. The Administration's draft legislation, submitted last May, provided for information sharing with clear privacy protections and strong oversight by the independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board.

Manning's first offseason of preparation in Denver — minicamps and organized team activities — will come under a microscope. Of course, it's arguable that Manning is used to that, but is he? He no longer will be in Indianapolis. He is succeeding not just Elway, but the Disney-esque Tim Tebow, the quarterback Elway cheered while on camera, but never truly embraced. Manning is going to be subjected to a new level of attention.

A: The stop-start feature you mention is gaining popularity as car makers intensify their efforts to save fuel and increase fuel economy. Many drivers have turned their engines off manually during short halts for decades and the practice has long been common in Europe. It seems reasonable to assume that doing so will shorten the life of certain components, your starter in particular, because it simply increases the amount of work those parts must do. However, I haven't heard of a notable increase in starter failures among people who do this.
The shares jumped 83 percent to $25.06 at 9:39 a.m. in New York for the largest intraday gain since the company’s initial public offering in 1993. Barnes & Noble had declined 5.5 percent this year before today.

We all know that Romney is among that lucky 1 percent. Fair-minded Americans don't begrudge his wealth and success. We would all like to walk in his penny loafers.
What we like about our contractors is that they design it, they build it and they maintain it. We're part of that process, to avoid rework and change orders compared to the nonunion competition. If we're going to regain our strength, we have to get that message to our membership and the public. Our productivity is at an all-time high in the country. And I think organized labor is an important part of that.

The fried chicken was crisp and juicy with a nice pepper note from the seasoned flour in the batter.

A: Across all of the industry, we saw growth over the last three years that dwarfed the national average. In fact, it was more than 10 times the expected change. Breaking it down across subsectors, we have seen significant job growth in the areas of biopharmaceuticals, research and lab services, medical devices and biofuels/industrial biotechnology. In forecasting ahead over the next couple of years, we expect to see continued growth over all of the subsectors, but we see the greatest job growth occurring in the areas of research and lab services as well as in biopharmaceuticals.

"Method to the Madness," which opens with Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy and other comedians anointing Lewis as comedy royalty, is an unabashed valentine.
