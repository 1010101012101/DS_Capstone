Headed by Sudanese Gen. Mustafa al-Dabi (he of Darfur genocide fame), the mission spent its first day in Damascus on ceremonials including a two-hour pep talk by President Bashar al-Assad. Unable to leave his palace, the despot was visibly jubilant at finding a polite, if not deferential, audience.

As I set out to explore the city, with my dog-eared copy of "Europe on $5 a Day" (Yes, it was $5 a day back then) tucked in my backpack, I stumbled upon a wonderland of twinkling white lights, tempting aromas and holiday music. I had no idea what I had come across, but it was magical. Little wooden huts decorated with greenery and bursting with handcrafted holiday ornaments and gifts were clustered around the square, with the spire of St. Stephen's Cathedral looming in the background. People were mingling, drinking hot mulled wine, shopping, laughing, enjoying the season and one another. I was hooked.

That's Coldplay in a nutshell. More than anything else -- or, for that matter, pretty much anyone else -- vocalist Chris Martin and crew simply want to please their fans. It doesn't matter if others (i.e. critics) think the group is making some wrong moves, Coldplay is going to fire those confetti cannons early and often if that's what it takes to satisfy the crowd.

Whicher's excellent arrest record led to his eventual transfer to an elite group of plainclothes officers. Dickens was in awe of them, writing: "They are, one and all, respectable-looking men of perfectly good deportment and unusual intelligence . . . with an air of keen observation and quick perception when addressed. . . . They have all good eyes; and they all can, and they all do, look full at whomsoever they speak to." Dickens' emphasis on the powers of scrutiny that detectives possessed is significant, for, as Summerscale explains, it was usually the overlooked detail that revealed the criminal. "A very little key will open a very heavy door," Dickens wrote in his short story "Hunted Down."

As disappointing as that was, there was worse news buried in the government report. Another 164,000 Americans dropped out of the labor force last month. These join the 1.2 million reported in January who had quit looking for work, and consequently are no longer counted when bureaucrats calculate the official unemployment rate.
For that $10,990 you get a car that a driver from a generation ago would marvel at for being loaded with so many extras. Front and side airbags, child restraints, air conditioning, a rear window defroster and an auxiliary audio input jack. Together those might not be enough to dissuade today's discriminating Lexus driver, but they certainly go well beyond four wheels and a chassis. As recently as a decade ago, an automatic parking system was merely an engineering fantasy and a voice-activated iPhone dock was nothing more than a series of unrelated words. To the average car buyer, push-button starting sounded as exotic as vertical take-off and lift. Today, it's hard to imagine a time when electric windows or cupholders were "optional," and it's safe to assume the cars of the near future will be even more richly equipped.

There is no question that Mr. al-Awlaki was a traitor to his country and wished harm on Americans. He belonged to a fanatical group that had sworn to make war on the U.S. and considered the murder of innocent civilians a legitimate means of achieving its goals. But in order to judge whether it was appropriate to target him as an enemy combatant, it’s important to know whether he did more than to serve as an inspiration for those who have sought to attack us, and the administration needs to lay out a full accounting of the facts justifying its action. Killing a terrorist mastermind who orchestrates the murder of innocent people is one thing; assassinating a propagandist — however vile he may be — simply because we don’t like what he says is another thing entirely.

At the primary care home, a dedicated care coordinator acts as the point person for managing routine referrals and necessary follow-up for members recently discharged from the hospital. This latter service has been extremely important in Healthy Howard's success at reducing so-called "admission-readmission rates" (where recently hospitalized patients are readmitted, often due to lack of appropriate follow-up care). Additionally, our system of after-hours phone triage, combined with subsidized coverage of urgent care visits, has averted costly emergency room trips. Taken together, these facets of the Healthy Howard plan have resulted in a 50 percent reduction in hospitalization rates and a 35 percent reduction in emergency room visit rates among our members, compared to the same demographic group across the United States.

Today, the combined value of AOL, Time Warner and Time Warner's recently spun off cable business totals around $40 billion.

So far, local deals are restricted to larger metropolitan areas, and deals may be pretty scanty in the smaller of those. For example, Groupon has nothing in my hometown of Ashland, Ore., or even in our proximate larger metro center, Medford. In fact, Groupon covers only three areas in Oregon, and in the two smaller -- Eugene and Salem -- Groupon lists only two current local deals. Even in an area as large as Chicago, today's list includes no accommodations; the only travel-related offer is a highly restricted discount on a Lake Michigan sightseeing boat excursion; the mix of deals in Boston and New York is about the same.

As more and more candidates seek the help of zealots who want to live up to the maxim, "I want to do my job well, earn my keep and live up to my full potential as a vote hustler," the more fragile our democracy will become.

For many of them and their aides, losing and failure are not options.

Wineries and vineyards have become important ambassadors for New Jersey’s agritourism, but their fate has been in limbo since a federal appeals court decision in December 2010 found New Jersey’s laws and regulations for wine producers unconstitutional because in-state and out-of-state wineries don’t abide by the same set of rules. The judge’s ruling was simple: Either all vineyards, both in-state or out-of-state, get outlets, or none do.

During the 35 years since Genoa became one of Portland's first serious restaurants -- there's still an original calligraphy announcement hanging in the hallway advertising seven courses for $7, compared with $80 now -- its Italianness has varied, with the lure of the Northwest sometimes poking into the peninsula. Sprague maintains Italian roots -- especially from the Piedmont region -- while reaching out to some other traditions.

So, it is a very good niche, and most of the people living in North County are the upper, let's say businesses and upper-income stream of people. In the 1970s and '80s, we didn't have living in all of San Diego County as many people as we have living in North County today.

But the PSA test itself does not guarantee that you have the cancer. You have to investigate further. As a doctor, I am able to diagnose the cancer years before it becomes a clinical issue. It is somewhat like using mammography to look for breast cancer. You see things early.

Ask your doctor about exercises that are appropriate to your condition.

To accompany the charcuterie, we've chosen the Spanish goat and sheep's milk cheeses Garrotxa, Zamorano, Manchego and Idiazabal. These are carefully aged cheeses, delicate and intensely flavored, each with their own particular piquancy. Alberto Sollis recommends, as accompaniment, serving Marcona almonds (imported from Spain, these almonds are roasted with olive oil and have a particularly sweet flavor) and fresh sliced pears with quince paste. We like Bartlett pears best for this tasting. They turn a golden yellow when ripe, and their delicate tart–sweetness goes perfectly with goat and sheep's milk cheeses; d'anjou and red pears will work nicely too. Grapes and apples are also flavorful accompaniments. Fruit will provide a sharp, bright contrast to the rich meats and cheese. Serve fresh sliced bread or crackers on the side. Set out bowls of olives. Sollis recommends arbequinas (a small olive with a buttery, slightly peppery taste) and manzanillas (the popular green olives stuffed with a pimento) as two of the most ideal olives to pair with Spanish charcuterie and cheese.

Some have rallied behind this new policy. Others have protested and launched boycotts of the state. And everywhere, people have expressed frustration with a system that seems fundamentally broken.

Ballard defeated Melina Kennedy by the same 51-to-47 percent margin that he defeated incumbent Bart Peterson by in 2007. Some have not accepted his legitimacy, and others grumblingly acknowledged it while crying over their lost opportunity for victory. Likewise, some Republicans have not acknowledged their new and uncomfortable position in the minority on the City-County Council and made a point of passing as many lame-duck measures as they could, ranging from redistricting to public safety policies.
Last year, Jones reached career-highs in home runs (25), RBIs (83), stolen bases (12) and slugging percentage (.466) and won the Most Valuable Oriole Award. Matt Wieters and Jones are considered the club's two best players. Jones has hit five homers and stolen four bases this season.

P & P: Primarily, "Off The Set" unravels the assumption that all porn stars must be jaded, emotionally detached individuals who live in a hedonistic blur, void of any real intimate relationships. When we began photographing couples in the porn industry, we found that to a large extent the opposite was true. Far from being incapable of intimacy, the people we met thrived on the strength of their personal relationships. In spite of what the mainstream media chides as the "dehumanizing" or "degrading" sex in which they engage for a living, we were not confronted with empty, passionless individuals. Far from being the mindless automatons cynically portrayed through the loaded questions and shady editing of investigative news programs, the men and women we met were genuine, thoughtful and acutely self-aware.

"The theological resolution to these questions remains the same today," said one canon law professor at Catholic University of America. "Once a man is validly ordained, he remains a priest forever.

It was a time for popping the champagne corks and offering a toast — which was done in the visitors’ clubhouse after the game as a tribute to Showalter, who became the 58th big league manager to win 1,000 career games. He earned No. 1,000 in the same city where he got his first — on April 7, 1992, when he debuted as Yankees manager.

Friday, a piercing film called "Hunger" opened at the Regency theater. It recounts a prison protest, a hunger strike. This movie, too, could have been called "Hunger."
As they face layoffs and rejection, some older workers blame age discrimination. Others cite simple economics. Experienced workers tend to earn higher salaries, and stress the company health-care plan, making them fatter targets for downsizing employers.

One such animal is the Western snowy plover, a rare shorebird that is considered threatened and protected by the U.S. Endangered Species Act. In 2006, the GGNRA enforced an emergency rule to protect the birds, which currently number less than 100. It requires dogs to be kept on leash at Ocean Beach and Crissy Field for 10 months every year from July through May.
The formula -- interwoven vignettes following dozens of characters who occasionally cross paths on their way to a schmaltzy ending -- does have its advantages. Because each story adds up to only a few minutes of screen time, you can afford enough A-listers to turn the movie into a "Where's Waldo?" game of spot-a-celebrity. Better yet, the characters and their cookie-cutter quirks never have a chance to wear out their welcome, despite having the emotional depth of a Hallmark commercial.
Foreclosure sales are opened foreclosures that have proceeded through the full disclosure process to final sale at public auction.
The merger will be an all-stock swap, with Continental shareholders getting 1.05 United shares for each Continental share they own, the Chronicle reported. United's shareholders will own a 55 percent stake in the merged company with Continental's shareholders holding the remaining 45 percent.

Stock's reassignment came a few days after the Cardinals signed Yadier Molina to a five-year extension and the same day Stock was cut from major league camp. Manager Mike Matheny was one of several officials who told Stock that his best route to the majors was on the mound, not behind the plate. The timing may have been surprise. The solution shouldn't have been.

The 24-year-old left-hander scattered six hits and allowed only a solo homer by Curtis Granderson in the first inning as Baltimore snapped a four-game losing streak against the Yankees this season.
Benson: Our costs are quite low if you really want to compare what's going on. And we've increased our financial aid over the last, I think its eight years, and this is internally generated...it's not the state, its not federal government. Where we've gone from $38 million to $120 million through our private philanthropy and pieces of tuition that we've stuck into that.

Midway through his senior season at Atholton, Stephenson, who spent his first three years of high school at Mount St. Joseph, said that he began to explore the possibility of attending prep school next year. But thanks to a “very random” connection that finally put him on the Division I radar, Stephenson won’t have to look into post-grad options any more. On Monday, he accepted a scholarship offer from the Virginia Military Institute.

Despite leading, Fieldston was actually being no-hit until centerfielder Dawit Heck scorched a base hit to center field to break up the bid in the bottom of the fourth. The ball was misplayed in right field by Charlie Davis, allowing Heck to advance to second. Heck took third on a wild pitch and then scored on a bunt single by Zach Jaffe.
However, Sen. Keith Faber, a Celina Republican, noted that Ohio's current congressional delegation is composed of 13 Republicans and five Democrats. "Today in Congress, the ratio is roughly the same as it will be under these maps," he said. "In the end, it's a fair and balanced map." Statehouse Republicans have argued the map is constitutional and complaint with federal voting rights law.
"But most colleges just saw a big guy who was a good athlete and wanted me to play either defensive end or tight end or linebacker," Bajema said.

‘‘He's fiery,'' said Darlene, his mother.
Obama carried Indiana in 2008, partly because of his ties to the populous northwestern part of the state neighboring his hometown of Chicago. Democrats acknowledge it will be difficult to win Indiana again this year. Still, the state could become more hospitable to Obama if the Democrats, believing they have a better chance with Lugar out of the race, spend heavily to compete against Mourdock. The state now is on the Obama team's watch list.
Many of the players on both teams are friends and classmates. After the game, the teams gathered for a group picture with their trophies.

The Bells averaged 25 wins a season under Cunningham's direction, and set a Central Coast Section record for wins with 34 in 2005, then tied the mark in 2006. His clubs won nine West Catholic Athletic League championships and three Central Coast Section crowns.
The flip flop: You might be wondering why companies like Sands would be talking so confidently about coming to Florida. After all, it was only a few months ago that then-candidate Rick Scott promised GOP primary voters that he would not allow a gambling expansion. Not "of any kind," Scott vowed to the Florida Baptist Witness. But then Scott got elected — and needed the 700,000 new jobs he promised more than he needed conservative Christian voters. So, two weeks after he was elected governor, the St. Petersburg Times reported that Scott flew to Vegas to meet with the CEO of the Sands corporation and later said he'd look at gambling "going forward." After he took heat for that, Scott said he'd "not taken any position."
OR-7: And speaking of OR-7, as so many celebrities do these days, he has a Twitter account — or some sheep in wolf’s clothing does. Good thing, too, because it’s not so easy keeping up with his travels. Though he crossed the state line back into Oregon last week, the California Department of Fish and Game said Tuesday that tracking data from the GPS collar the wolf wears showed he’d moved back into the Golden State.

Gear shuttled from the bus into the ballpark, and Warden and Patterson were able to catch a glimpse of the emerald-green grass and the distinctive two-story pavilion that rose behind home plate. Tiger Stadium wasn't considered a pitcher's ballpark but on that late afternoon the two rookies couldn't have cared less. While the design of Tiger Stadium remained as iconic as any in the land, the ballpark sported plenty of obstructed seats, thanks to a plethora of support columns, and the bleacher seats were uncomfortable and often a distance from the action. "Watching a game in Detroit is a graduate course in capturing the magic of the old-time ballparks," Time magazine said decades later. "Unlike the ivy-clad perfection of Wrigley Field or the self-congratulatory ugliness of Fenway Park, Tiger Stadium represents the last remaining link with baseball before it became too self-conscious."
Reporting from New York -- The National Book Critics Circle gave its 2011 fiction prize to Edith Pearlman, an under-the-radar writer of short stories, at its annual awards ceremony Thursday evening at the New School.

"We had a lot of talks with their moms before shooting the scary stuff," concedes Joost.
Drum master Huang Chih-Chun is the central warrior, fearsome in a three-headed mask, virtuosic in an extended drum solo with his shirtless back to the audience. He's joined by the company's men – except for a gorgeous slow processional to the sound of muted gongs, the women are largely relegated to the roles of percussionists, vocalists or attendants – two of whom take on the roles of villain and fool. The scene is one of the show's few missteps: The abrupt shift from atmospheric tranquility to histrionic spoken word, cackles and caricatured facial gestures is jarring. Far more emotionally resonant is the scene of a cluster of dancers advancing to the edge of the stage, tapping gourds and slowly stretching flexed feet from under red-hued robes; it's vaguely menacing without being literal, a better theatrical fit for this nuanced company.
But Dodman said that according to research on the canine brain, with analog television, dogs could see only a flickering screen. New technologies like digital TV, high-definition cameras and enhanced production have changed the way dogs perceive the images, while big screens allow them to see from anywhere in a room, Neumann said.

The larger cities of the county eventually took turns hosting a countywide event, replacing celebrations by individual towns. Patriotic floats, open cars bearing proud heroes back in uniform with medals gleaming on their khaki tunics, American Legion groups, marching military units, soul-stirring bands, drum and bugle corps, all parading with the stars and stripes flying, brought lumps to the throats of some and aroused fierce patriotic pride in others.

Craig and Freese hit their homers in back-to-back at-bats against Arizona reliever Bryan Shaw. According to the tracker, Craig's bolt left his bat at 104.8 mph and Freese's left his at 106.3 mph. (The top exit speed for a homer so far this season is Travis Hafner's homer against Kansas City's Luis Mendoza on April 15. That left his bat at 117.2 mph.) The top height of Craig's homer was 111 feet, and the apex of Freese's homer was 84 feet. (Holliday's homer had an apex of 126 feet, which is 60 feet more than a home run he hit earlier this month at Busch.) That gives you a sense of the detail to which Hit Tracker has always calculated homers and, yes, it's a lot of numbers to describe a base hit that really results in the only number that matters: a run.
He hopes that this new movie will allow viewers to see chimps in a new light -- not as movie performers, or as pets to be put in cages, but as sensitive creatures that share the bulk of their DNA with humans.

Two months after his 2007 election, Sarkozy's then-wife Cecilia traveled to Libya and helped negotiate the release of Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor sentenced to death on charges of infecting children with HIV. Their case had strained Libya's relations with the international community.
Chen, a blind, self-taught lawyer, has emerged as a symbol of the Chinese civil rights movement after exposing forced abortions and sterilizations as part of China's one-child policy and then enduring almost seven years of prison and house arrest. His dramatic, nighttime escape last week from local authorities into the halls of the U.S. Embassy — just before Clinton and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner were to arrive for unrelated meetings — had all the ingredients for a diplomatic fiasco.

If you're putting in a smaller, one- or two-person tub, you'll actually use less water than a conventional tub. But a four-person version can hold a lot of water -- close to 250 gallons, compared to around 50 for a conventional tub. So floor joists need to be able to hold the weight of the water, not just the tub.
