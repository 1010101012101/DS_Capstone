After hearing of Brian Elliott's third straight shutout for the Blues, I can't help but wonder why he was so terrible for the Avs and why he's flourishing in St Louis. I understand The Tank stretch last year and a better overall team and D in front of him in St Louis makes a difference but is there more to that story? Did the Avs give up on him too quick? And how does the goalie situation for next year shape up? Both Varly and Jiggy in the plans?

"The Nightmare Before Christmas" (1993): Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, discovers Christmas Town and decides he wants to take over the holiday as well as the job of Santa Claus (or, to him, Sandy Claws).

Whale coach Ken Gernander said Tuesday. "That dynamic of it is a bit different. ... But you have a pretty good base knowledge of their personnel.

Although Progressive share much in common with CPUSA and DSA, they are shrewd enough to understand the terms "communist" or "socialist" are unpalatable for most Americans. Hence, the word "Progressive" was injected into American political verbiage.

By that he means executing what aides call a 50-state strategy — for a nomination contest that’s determined state by state. It’s a nontraditional path that other candidates have tried unsuccessfully.

Such disregard for life, such brutal allegiance to hatred of a particular class of people doesn't happen in a vacuum. Or maybe it does. Perhaps the people who killed these horses were never taught to respect life as children; perhaps they never knew anyone gay growing up. And as we know, demons fill the void for most of us -- demons and fear. It is only through the light of love and kindness that we emerge blinking and squinting into our humanity.

This isn't about fracking, as such, questionable and dirty though that technique may be. After all, many Ohio eco-crunchies who think fracking is the worst thing since bubonic plague also want Ohioans to burn natural gas, not, say, coal. And fracking aims to find natural gas.

If it wasn't for a human being at my local bank branch, who figured out something was very wrong and gave me a call, I would have been financially dead and buried and completely oblivious while overseas.

Elegance was largely the province of the program's first half, in which pianist Garrick Ohlsson was the soloist for Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 9 in E-Flat, the "Jeunehomme."

I would add that nothing quite replaces seeing the real faces of neighbors and neighborly strangers. Somehow those "Cartoon Yourself!" profile pics are less satisfying.

Did William Shakespeare truly pen those brilliant plays? That is the question.
"The Book of Mormon," a smash-hit Broadway musical made out of the unlikeliest of elements - unwavering faith, jokes about AIDS and lyrics so profane that many of its songs could not be televised - emerged as the runaway prizewinner at the Tony Awards on Sunday. Created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone of "South Park" fame, along with the composer Robert Lopez, "Mormon" won for best director, score, book and featured actress, among other categories.
Staging "The Tempest," Scott Palmer admits, wasn't his choice for the big summer production by Bag & Baggage, his venturesome Hillsboro theater company.

A new six-foot wide sidewalk will be built on the southbound side of the bridge.
“Defense and rebounding, that’s the whole key,” Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau said. “The big thing was they got into the open floor. They got easy baskets. You get easy baskets early in the game, you’re going to get confidence. When a team gets confidence, they’re much harder to shut down.”
In past years the Spring Celebration took place the last weekend in April. It was scheduled then to coincide with the neighborhood showcase of dogwood blooms that became the community logo.

The first single from Spektor's long-awaited return, "What We Saw from the Cheap Seats," "All the Rowboats" finds her speaking for the paintings hanging in an art museum with a misplaced sense of drama that makes this dark piano ballad all the more intriguing. "First there's lights out; then there's lockup," Spektor sings. "Masterpieces serving maximum sentences/It's their own fault for being timeless/There's a price to pay and a consequence." As consequences go, it's not a bad life for a painting. But Spektor's delivery definitely sells it with passion.

Detroit, sinking under massive debt from pension and benefits costs for its employees, risks appointment by Gov. Rick Snyder of an emergency manager to restore the citys finances.

øIn May of 2004, U.S. investigators weren't so sure either. They had information about al Qaeda plans to develop an anthrax program, the NRC report said.

Three samples tested positive for Ames strain anthrax in tests, conducted at the USAMRIID lab. They had been taken from "an unopened medicine dropper package, a sink, and a sink drain hose," according to a partly-declassified FBI report.

Anyway, after a lovely Japanese maple died of verticillium wilt, I replaced it with a chocolate mimosa (Albizia julibrissin). It's a delicate, lacy tree with fernlike leaves of mahogany. That first spring, to my dismay, DTWG pruned off the lower branches. We had one of those stimulating conversations with me ending up telling him that if the tree was dead, I'd have to kill him. When by late May there was no sign of leaves, I was preparing his obit. Fortunately, before I could reach for my shovel in June, it began leafing out.

"In Brooklyn I couldn't find anywhere to build, it was too retail oriented. The Bronx was way too commercial and unfriendly. Then we started looking into North Bergen and the Meadowlands. The Meadowlands didn't want us because of Xanadu, they didn't want anymore trucks going into the Meadowlands area, so I said let's back up five miles closer to Manhattan. We took a building that existed already, we tore it down, started from scratch, and built a USDA facility from scratch."

Creative bites also work well, particularly those that use tuna. Eddie's cucumber roll ($8.95) features cucumber ribbons wrapped around an assembly of shimmering tuna, sprouts, avocado and shiso. It's even better dragged through the swath of spicy sauce. The Valencia roll ($7.50) amps up basic tuna with a topping of salsa. It seems strange to mix the Mexican and Japanese elements, but the combination is delightful.

The leadership of the Union Club -- downtown's oldest private club -- welcomed its newest neighbors Oct. 18 at an after-work cocktail party to roll out the red carpet to Cleveland State University and the Cleveland Play House. The party celebrated PlayhouseSquare's recent partnership with CSU and the Play House to share the newly renovated Allen Theatre. An invite-only guest list of 200 included Union Club members as well as board members of PlayhouseSquare, Cleveland Play House and CSU. Partygoers were treated to cocktails and hors d'oeuvres in the club's grand foyer before jaunting around the corner to tour the theater. Earlier in the day, Jones Day attorney and Union Club president Bill Coquillette measured the distance from the Union Club dining room to the theater.

If I wanted to start picking apart "A Different Kind of Truth," the band's first album with Roth since "1984," I could. Particularly lyrically. Yep, just checked: Roth does indeed sing the words "thunder thong" in "She's the Woman." And "Tattoo" is a goofy mess of hula girls and talking Elvises and union shout-outs.

Just like Thursday, when it reached 78 degrees in Newark — 25 degrees more than the average high of 53 for this time of the year and 2 degrees shy of a record set in 1938 — there will likely be more people calling in sick with mysterious illnesses, more people in short sleeves and more people finding reasons to get out of the house.
The third-seeded Lakers are one win away from a second-round date with Oklahoma City, but the Nuggets forced Los Angeles to board a plane for Denver on Wednesday. Coach George Karl gratefully fed Bynum's offhanded post-practice comment to his players, and they played like a team that isn't going anywhere.

That's how it started in 1977 when she was 40. The next year, she decided to try running a marathon. She can still remember her first 20-mile training run, which she did in a rather unorthodox way.
Romney has won more than 55% of the delegates allocated to date and needs about 45% of the remaining delegates to go over the top. Rick Santorum's extremely slim chance of becoming the nominee depends on a contested convention rejecting Romney on the first ballot and then turning to him as an alternative. That scenario, which has never materialized in the modern primary era, has become even more remote as Romney has won pivotal victories in Michigan, Ohio and, most recently, Illinois.
The cons: He may have trouble winning over guys like Jimmy Iovine, who cautioned, "This isn't 'American Comedian'; this is "American Idol." Plus, his taste in music doesn't match his personality. If he had to do a Michael Bolton song, he should have gone with that "Jack Sparrow" song.

In the computer-based game, players use their wits to take on enemies. The five video game designers, who have been working on the game for three years, modeled it after nine layers of Hell in “Dante’s Inferno,” but instead, made nine levels that touch on Math, English, and other subjects taught in high school. The player must successfully answer grammar and math questions to move through the worlds, and battle bosses to get to the next level.

As JoeSportsFan points out, two years earlier Pujols asked not to be called that nickname. In an interview with Post-Dispatch sportswriter Bernie Miklasz, Pujols is quoted as saying: "I don't want to be called that (El Hombre).

You can call me whatever else you want but just don't call me El Hombre."

You could nit-pick the offensive line, which will start a couple of young guys. But right beside the inexperienced players -- holding the rope -- are York (22 starts) and Mark Asper (24 starts). And you could say that six starters on the defense are gone, but the replacements are hardly raw. We all saw how liberally defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti substituted last season.

There's no doubt that this accelerated schedule would be good for Villaraigosa's legacy; what's unclear is whether it would be good for Los Angeles. Subways and light-rail lines are a modern city's economic arteries, and the sooner we build them, the better. And it's true that they have long lifespans and would benefit future generations. But by bonding now against revenue that won't materialize for more than 25 years, we would in effect be billing our kids (or grandkids) for today's projects and setting transportation priorities now for a city that may look very different in half a century. That's a trade-off that has to be carefully considered as Villaraigosa's proposal is fleshed out in the coming months.
The Malibu Eco moved along well but wasn't a sportster. Zero-to-60-miles-an-hour time is a ho-hum 8.7 seconds, and the four-cylinder engine sounded strained under hard acceleration.

Wall Street, of course, hears what it wants to hear.
Carl Tuma, 46, said he stopped by and told petitioners he felt they had poorly chosen the day of their event. While he supported the group exercising the right to petition — "I understand their cause, and what they're doing is great" — he felt it was disrespectful to call attention to their own cause on the anniversary of the attacks.
While some of this is a dream, it makes sense. Lakers get the next in a long line of great centers. Orlando gets a couple young bigs with upside for Howard and avoid the LeBron debacle. Philly moves a player for some cap relief and adds a potential key veteran as they grow their young team. The Cavs become a playoff contender with a starting lineup of BD, Boobie, Iggy, Gasol and Andy and depth in the front court with a developing role players like Samuels, Harangody, Erdin. The shooting guard can be addressed in free agency.
Mickelson was inducted with two-time major champion Sandy Lyle of Scotland, writer Dan Jenkins, British player-turned-broadcaster Peter Alliss, and four-time LPGA major champion Hollis Stacy.

This is an especially busy week for independent and foreign films. The much-talked-about documentary "Bully" opens nationwide with a hard-won PG-13 rating. The Oscar-nominated Israeli drama "Footnote," about the thorny relationship between father-and-son academics, opens locally. The martial-arts import "The Raid: Redemption" turns an Indonesian tenement into ground zero of a cops-and-robbers showdown. The documentary "Jiro Dreams of Sushi" invites us into the Tokyo basement that is the center of the raw-fish subculture. The documentary "Bombay Beach," playing this weekend at Webster University, transports us to an encampment in the California desert. "Battle Royale," released in Japan in 2000 and now playing the midnight-movie circuit in the U.S. (including today and Saturday at the Tivoli), transports us to a deserted island where teenagers are forced to fight to the death.

Parkway West, after notching wins over Nerinx Hall, Lafayette and Marquette, fell to 3-3.
"Extremely Loud" was directed by Stephen Daldry, who is best known for movies like "Billy Elliot," "The Hours" and "The Reader." Daldry does an excellent job of pulling together the movie's "we are all connected, we shall overcome" theme all the while bravely placing the movie in the hands of his young lead, whose only previous experience in front of a camera was for Kid's Week on "Jeopardy!"

The 25-minute symphony is an homage to Prokofiev's Symphony No. 2; that, in turn, is an homage to Beethoven's Piano Sonata in C minor, op. 111. As a composer, "I'm not only taking the listener on a journey," Rouse said, "I'm on a journey, too. Sometimes you have to hitch a ride; I hitched a ride with Prokofiev. The car was his second symphony. It's a wonderful work, and I decided to take that as my model."
The ruling is breathtaking in its disregard of people’s dignity and even logic.

Philip Glass is one of a handful of living classical composers who have attained a place in the collective public consciousness. His work, large-scale pieces such as the 1976 opera Einstein on the Beach and movie scores like The Hours, is easily identifiable, mesmerizing and wholly original.

"I thought George was playing well, but D.C. had a look of determination in his eyes that I've seen sometimes where he was really getting into the basketball, defending," Vogel said. "Right about the time I was thinking about (going back to Hill), he made a couple of nice plays on the offensive end. So we decided to roll with it, and I've always said if whatever position we're looking at, if I have a guy in the second unit that is playing well or I have a gut feeling, we'll go with him."

Many are concerned with how much sugar they consume. To my way of thinking, why waste your sugar intake on, say, soy milk? I'd rather enjoy sugar where it counts in taste, perhaps in a couple of small pieces of dark chocolate.

Lunch at Wazuzu wasn't necessary, but in Vegas what is? With gluttony on the brain, I began with a vegan crunch roll ($18) — string beans, cucumber and avocado topped with Japanese rice crackers — and a California roll ($12) made with avocado, cucumber, asparagus and brown rice wrapped in seaweed. After mixing wasabi and ginger, I downed the four-piece crunch roll in seconds and felt that, finally, I was experiencing a side of Vegas previously unknown to my taste buds. Typical casino lunches used to consist of my sneaking French fries off friends' buffet plates. This, however, was no typical casino lunch.
The $1.7 million settlement will include payments to California's Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment and the Center for Environmental Health.

A: What it does is it means that I'm never out of shape. You can get out of shape of writing, and I'm always writing something. Even when I'm making a feature of my own, I'm probably writing for somebody else right up until the day that I start to shoot. And while I'm editing -- I edit my own movies -- I'm probably writing something for somebody else. It's my job. It's what I do for a living. And I really just never get out of shape, because I'm always doing that thing of just solving story problems.

LaRose said the current process -- which produced a congressional map panned by most nonpartisan observers this spring -- needs an overhaul.

Football is a sport traditionally associated with the fall. Once the leaves start to change, the pads start popping and tailgate parties pop up all over the country.

Rogosin's film also seems unthinkably remote from what we now consider documentary. "On the Bowery" follows in the pioneering tradition of Robert Flaherty, who used reenactments in his documentaries, and upholds the political commitment of the neorealists, who were finding and creating drama in the rubble of postwar Italy.

In surveys of non-Mormons, only a small minority say they are familiar with the church. Romney, a lifelong church member and one-time top LDS leader in the Boston area, will be their introduction.

The most visible member of Mormonism might end up practicing his religion in private.

One of the False statements came from a fundraising email last June, when Brown's campaign wrote of a Republican "plan to end Medicare." PolitiFact Ohio found the claim misleading because it characterized the GOP plan as Medicare's unqualified death.

I'm looking out the window, listening, but thinking about the sun. About the thin light we're quickly losing, about the urgency of heading back east to beat night. I'm thinking about the collective nightmare that became our lives for hours into days, about the biblical 'rainbow sign' sent after the rains, wondering how it will make itself known this time. As I drift further, what wanders in from the circle of angry voices is a stray thought, a fragment, offered up as a single puzzle piece of a larger explanation: 'Maybe it had to burn ... like how sometimes you have to burn a field. To make something new ...'
