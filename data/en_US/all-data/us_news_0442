But it's well to remember that the scare story of four decades ago wasn't global warming, but global cooling and the tale was told in the same portentous tone. As Newsweek put it in 1975, Meteorologists disagree about the cause and extent of the cooling trend But they are almost unanimous in the view that the trend will reduce agricultural productivity for the rest of the century. Oh yeah: Almost unanimous.

For starters, there's the set, which includes a 20-foot mechanical flower, elaborate spider webs and massive poles that represent the stems of dandelions. Then there's the score, by Brazilian composer Berna Ceppas, which is fueled by percussion to capture the fast-paced life of the forest. And there are the acrobats and trapeze artists, who Colker says will make you believe they can fly. There's also plenty of broad comedy, making this one of the most family-friendly shows in Cirque's repertoire.
And, he said, “I do think if he were here now he’d be heartbroken and angry. In 1900, Twain saw the great American industrial and corporate behemoths emerging.” He read them the riot act, Holbrook said, because, “Mark Twain’s heart was with the common man.” And despite a frequent rollicking laugh, Holbrook also speaks angrily of “the stuff we’re now confronting with banks and corporations.”
Easter Island has seen an enormous boost in development in the last few years as tourists flock to this remote but beautiful outpost in the South Pacific Ocean. July 2010 saw the greatest influx of tourists in the island's history, as thousands — myself included — came from around the world to witness a total solar eclipse under the watchful eyes of the moai, the enigmatic giant carved stone heads that dot the island. (The eclipse was a rare treat; the next total eclipse visible from the island won't happen for more than 300 years.)
Though one of them jabbed his opponent in the groin at the end, the duo brought passion and eloquence to an eye-glazing issue.

"I wanted hotel bragging rights. I wanted to say, 'We have the champs!'" she said, pumping her fists in the air. "I felt bad for them, the seniors especially."
Finally, we got to the main event: Borobudur, a few hours by van from Yogyakarta. Near a ramshackle village strung along a bumpy road, it is one of the least touristy UNESCO World Heritage Sites I've visited. I didn't see a hotel until we entered the temple gate and parked at a cluster of low buildings set around beds of orange cannas. This was the Manohara guest house, originally built for researchers and architectural historians that completed a major renovation of the temple in 1983. Now open to travelers, it provides a welcome drink ofCoca-Cola with tamarind, modest rooms, good food in an open-air dining room, a video introduction to Borobudur and easy access to the temple, especially for people who want to see it at sunrise.

He purposely put on weight, Yarno said. I think he wanted to just be a little firmer in the run and the pass. Hes right at 300 (last year), and I think he wants to be in the 315-320 range to have more mass in order to get movement in the run game and stop the pass rush, the inside pass rush. So hes firmer.

It has been well documented how young this team is. Nearly three-fourths of the team has three or more years of eligibility remaining. The team is young and still will be led by sophomores in key positions, including the skill spots. There is also more talent top to bottom than ever and this showed in the depth of positions hurt by injury, like wide receiver. If these players can gel fast this team has the ability to surprise.

If you prefer open hillside to forest, hike the south side of the hill. Start up the same trail, but continue bearing to the right and uphill. You will cross large swaths of meadow. A bench is provided at a panoramic overlook near a grove of acacia trees, where you can see gorgeous views of the bay, Berkeley, Oakland and the hills beyond. Stay on the fire road until it exits the Natural Area at King Court. Walk uphill to Shevlin Drive. Then turn right (downhill) and walk along Shevlin past a series of regal courts - Baron, Duke and Earl - to Moeser Lane. Once rock from the quarry above raced down Moeser in metal cars along narrow-gauge rails heading toward crushers. The heavy cars hurtling down Moeser would pull the empty cars back up.

A great star at Miami of Ohio 10 years ago, he has been the ideal teammate this season, hitting 3s, rebounding, pointing to assist-makers, and high-fiving everyone. That is the big picture. It is why the Cavs kept him. In the small, intimate close-ups that make up the playoffs, God might not be in the details, but victory often is. On that scale, he will be judged by inches.
Although there was no formal opposition group, Brookman residents had voiced concerns. At a recent City Council meeting, some said they don't feel informed or included in the proposal and that the timing is premature because the annexation is larger than the city needs.

College classrooms, auditoriums, dormitories -- all should remain sanctuaries for learning and experience at the crucial moment of young adulthood.

As Orban spoke Tuesday, about 40 people marched in freezing weather to Budapest from Borsod County, one of the country's poorest, hoping to bring the plight of their region to the government's attention.

On the Saturday we visited, Sean and Alexis, the two 9-year-olds in our group of five, couldn't wait to try it. They stood for more than half an hour in the line that snaked up the stairs to the top. When they emerged at the bottom, dripping and happy, we asked them what they thought.
Some may see the glass as half empty, but that's not how the legislative process works. Those who aren't willing to compromise seldom get anything done (Congress is offering prime examples of that on a regular basis).

Season with one-half teaspoon salt and cook until the farro is tender but still a little chewy, about 45 minutes. Drain (there will probably still be some liquid left), rinse under cold running water and gently pat dry in a kitchen towel.
"That gives me a unique perspective on grass roots racing," Francois said. He may race some time on the track, but not this year, he said.
The new pavilion will focus on cardiac care, starting with diagnostic tests. Patient rooms were designed to be comfortable and safe for patients and family members, efficient for employees, and big enough - 325 square feet - for teaching new doctors and housing in-room computers. Equipment is laid out identically in each room so nurses and doctors can easily figure out where things are. Patients should need to travel less between various tests and procedures.

Americans bought RVs in record numbers between 2002 and 2007, despite rising gas prices, a study by the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association shows.

Congress has -- once again -- considered a new climate and energy bill, and then blinked, instead of passing it. As in the movie Groundhog Day, they seem condemned to keep starting, over and over, until they get it right. It's a good thing there's not much at stake, aside from the fate of the earth's climate, the disastrous dependence on oil, and the costs to the American taxpayers to clean up this mess.
"There's always danger. There's so many ways you can get hurt, or your life taken," said Gary Williams, a miner and pastor of New Life Assembly, a church near the southern West Virginia mine.

Most of their bulk is below water (seven-eighths, to be exact), and close approach by boat is dangerous. But kayakers can't seem to resist paddling in close to touch their surface. For them, the risk is not so much that the berg will roll -- a kayak would float on the sudden swell -- but that sheets of ice may vertically sheer off.
Saddled by injuries and inconsistency, the Panthers (17-15), lost their way. Barring a miracle run this week at Madison Square Garden, Gibbs’ career will likely come to a close only miles from where he grew up and went to high school at Seton Hall Prep.

And if LTE—which I consider the only true 4G network in the U.S.—matters to you, bear in mind that AT&T offers that service in just 31 markets, versus 203 for Verizon.

(In) all of those stories there’s something in there that is alike. That’s why we’re so close and that’s why we all want the same goal and all want to reach the same dreams. I think that us being from JUCO we can talk about those JUCO days and how hard it was and how we didn’t have anything like we have now.

His identification with Eva Perón, the charismatic and power-hungry first lady of Argentina who died young in 1952, stemmed from them both becoming internationally famous by age 26. "What happens now?/ Where do you go from here? For someone on top of the world/ The view is not exactly clear.…" The success of "Superstar," says Rice, had generated anxiety and doubt as to whether he would ever have another hit. "How do you follow it up? That became quite a problem," he recalls.

"I like it right now," Scott said of the new plan. "I enjoy the fact that we get to stay over and guys can get some sleep, get up the next day and get a workout in and get on the plane. We don't have to worry when we get into that city, trying to find a gym or anything like that. As opposed to last year, I kind of like this setup better. We'll take a look at it when this is all said and done and get ready for next year. But right now, I really like the fact that, if we have an opportunity to stay in town, I think it does help with our guys getting more rest."

Eight states sued US Fidelis and the Atkinsons on Thursday, and a ninth filed suit on Friday. More are believed to be considering similar actions and could pile on in coming weeks.

All Garden State shows are dark on Monday, and just a precious few play in New York. They are the long-runners --"The Phantom of the Opera," "Chicago," "Mamma Mia!" -- and they schedule Monday shows to avoid competing with the new hot shows on other nights. "Phantom" offers a disfigured man losing the love of his life while "Chicago" has a young woman shoot hers, so these may not be ideal for the holiday. But "Mamma Mia!" involves romance, a wedding and such songs as "Lay All Your Love on Me" and, fittingly enough, "I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do." "Mamma Mia!' presents an 8 p.m. Valentine's Day performance at the Winter Garden Theatre, 1634 Broadway at 50th Street. $69.50-$127.50; call (212) 239-6200 or visit mammamianorthamerica.com.

Another standing ovation after intermission, this time for the whole orchestra after Mussorgsky's "Pictures at an Exhibition." With the massive foundation of brass leading the way right off the bat, every section had its chance to shine. The woodwinds chattered through the "Ballet of the Chicks," the percussion gave Baba-Yaga a menacing impact, and the appearance and then fade by the strings of the peasant cart in "Bydlo" was perfectly smooth from ponderous climax into distant silence. This was a leisurely stroll through the musical gallery with tempos on the moderate side and with pauses before most of the pictures. Some might have preferred a different approach-more Russian energy than French sophistication-and more variation in the pace of each move from picture to picture. But there's no denying that Robertson's decisions made "The Great Gate at Kiev" just that.
"As a player, you have to stay the course," Young said, "If you think outside of it and worry about everything else that's going going on, it will get to you."

But he's on the same pay scale as the rest of the NFL in the playoffs.
For the past two years, the MLS standings served as a pretty reliable power ranking. Each team played the others home and away and the scoreboard and records told the tale.
Republican critics dismissed Obama's two-day tour as political posturing. Ohio, like Nevada and New Mexico, is a battleground state that Obama carried four years ago. Oklahoma, conversely, could hardly be a redder state. Sen. John McCain won there by 32 percentage points in 2008.
"I thought it was one of the most original aspects of the movie, the mixture of documentary and narrative," said Black, while adding that the structure deepens the film's darkly comic tone. "It's not an easy film to emotionally navigate. It turns a lot of rules on their head."

At the Bridgetown Comedy Festival this year, Gavlick was booked with a bill of other, older comics at a Southeast Portland bar. "I show up two minutes before the show, and the bouncer says, 'I'm gonna need to see your ID.' So I show him my performers' pass. He says, 'No, I really need your ID, something with your age on it.' I show him my school ID card. It's all I had on me. I told him, 'I'm underage, but I'm a performer.'"
But history shows both are needed. A handful of counties have already failed to meet the MOE obligation in recent years, and the state can't continue to bear the full retirement cost of teachers.

Polls show that the voters are more likely to support a tax increase if the money goes to schools and public safety than to other state services, which explains why the governor's initiative is being sold the way it is. Yet as important as those priorities are, they are not the only obligations the state must meet. The belt-tightening in recent years has moved well past the stage of trimming the easy targets of "waste, fraud and abuse." Instead, lawmakers have been slashing medical care for the poor and the elderly, diminishing support for state colleges and universities, shutting parks and cutting early childhood programs and welfare benefits.
“It was a hard-fought game,” Portland general manager and head coach Mike Johnston said of a contest that turned chippy with 12 minor penalties and one game misconduct in the closing 13:38. “This is playoff hockey.

While no one would doubt Payne's stewardship — his previous three films, "Sideways," "About Schmidt" and "Election," were nominated for a combined eight Academy Awards and won one Oscar — Clooney said King was not precisely in his wheelhouse, which ultimately was part of its attraction. It's hard to make Clooney look bad, but King bears scant resemblance to the polished-to-perfection Danny Ocean in "Ocean's Eleven" or Ryan Bingham in "Up in the Air." As Clooney himself describes King, he's a schlub, and there's not much to look at on the inside, either.

For Bret Lizundia of the engineering firm Rutherford & Chekene, the different tower designs were exciting because it meant experimenting with unusual bracing systems. "One day I got an e-mail from Basel saying, 'We've got a new tower.' That was the stacked-box idea. If you stack drawers and rotate them just a bit each time, you would have a tower that would be leaning out and oriented differently at the base and at the top," says Lizundia. That sort of idea was eventually built, and Lizundia's firm worked out the central cast-concrete elevator shaft, the 6-degree rotation for each level and the parallelogram shapes of each of the upper floors. "The long sides get closer and closer and ever steeper. The less wide windowless walls are stepped and provide shear strength. To keep the leaning tower standing, steel cables were threaded through the concrete walls and fastened at the base.
I was angry. I was angry because if Portland had played with half as much heart, energy, and fight in their two previous games they would have rolled into Boston after crushing Philly and New Jersey in the days before.

One reason for this, it turns out, is that some paid for their defiance with their lives. Among them was Srdjan Aleksic, a Serb from a town called Trebinje who, in 1993, spotted a Muslim he knew getting accosted by a Serbian soldier. Aleksic intervened and helped the Muslim escape, an act of outsized courage that unfortunately prompted several other soldiers to leap into the fray. They began belting and pummeling him in broad daylight, with plenty of people standing around. No one stopped them. By the time Aleksic was wheeled into the emergency room of a nearby hospital, he'd fallen into a coma, and was soon pronounced dead.

It’s a good time to teach them the facts of life regarding bunnies and peeps. They all need care and attention. How many people know how to care for them properly? Precious few, I’m afraid, and those who have bought bunnies at Easter time in the past and took proper care of them after Easter will attest to the fact that they require specialized care and concern.

Favorite part of sport: "How much of a team game it is. There is no way to be successful without playing defense as a team and sharing the ball."
"Miracles happen in mediation," Kossoff said.
Harrison’s play has been criticized for lacking warmth. This production appeared to leap that hurdle, even though many of the characters follow stereotypes, to some extent. The cacophony of voices, from television commercials, public announcements and what-have-you, a cascade of Mozart’s music, the throb of a vintage Rolling Stones number and a firmament of general sounds that reflect the junk-encrusted visuals on stage, add much humanity. The gap between thought and speech that Moll pursues is tough to describe and tough for her to pursue, but the idea gives us something to ponder.

But what is undeniable is that for too many Orioles fans, the feeling they want to get from following their favorite team now eludes them. Fans want to believe that this year, there's a chance.

I have never been a member of a labor union, and have run my own small business during my professional life, but I still have a hard time believing that the "business community" should be the sole arbiter for what is best for San Diego.

Vocaturo notes that his edgy, hoarse vocals – which sometimes draw comparisons to the Replacements’ Paul Westerberg – evolved naturally after years of singing. “I don’t smoke, so it doesn’t come from that,” he says. “And when I was younger, I wasn’t raspy at all.

The Flyers had one potentially crucial goal disallowed with 2:08 remaining in the second period. Brodeur stopped Briere’s shot, but the rebound came out to vanRiemsdyk, who scored into the open side of the net. It was waved off because Brayden Schenn clipped Brodeur.

Since 2010, more than half of the 29,000 Clinic employees who are members of the employee health plan -- about 16,000 of them -- have enrolled in the health system's program called "Healthy Choice." The Clinic wants to motivate the other 13,000 to do the same.
Wright toted a .389 batting average into tonight’s game, but there is reason to believe he will not chase .400 this season. His batting average on balls in play before tonight was a sky-high .446, more than 120 points above his career average. That number suggests a trend of good luck, and baseball has a way of reversing trends.
Like other students in my position, I was too proud to share my struggles outside of my family and close friends. As a black student in a predominantly white environment, I was already hyper-visible. I didn't want people to feel sorry for me or give off the perception that I was just another hostile black person, even though I didn't owe anyone confirmation or contradiction of their stereotyping.
And then the Hawks unraveled while reverting back with a flurry of turnovers and rushed shots. The Celtics seemingly turned every one of those miscues into points during a 21-3 run that gave them a 41-31 lead and energized their fans.

This part is basic and boring, but deserves to be said. Modern learning theory confirms what a lot of us have figured out from experiences: people learn in different ways. Evangelical Protestant teaching and preaching has relied very heavily on the spoken word. But what about those who aren't auditory learners? What we are taught is far more likely to stick if it comes to us through more than one sense. The embodied rituals of the church often communicate the gospel through site, touch, movement - even smell. Is this not a helpful thing?

There are few depths to which PETA is unwilling to stoop to get attention, including public nudity, splashing red paint on women wearing fur coats and exploring Internet porn. But has the attention bought PETA respect, or credibility? I haven't seen polls on that question, but in my experience the mention of the organization's name produces little more than widespread eye-rolling. In its quest for publicity, PETA has turned itself into a joke whose radicalism alienates even many hardcore animal rights supporters. Whither PETA, so goes the Heartland Institute -- which is probably good news for those of us who'd like to stop arguing about the science and start figuring out solutions.

Americans — including Marylanders — distrust and question big institutions. They see our nation divided economically as never before (with the increasing consolidation of wealth, increasing financial burdens on the middle class, and less opportunities for springing out of poverty). And they feel that everyone in politics — Democrats and Republicans alike — is in the pockets of special and elite interests.
With all teams saddled with at least one back-to-back-to-back this season, coaches are being challenged to deal with them. Two other teams with three-in-threes this week took very different approaches.
The story to this point: Bella (Stewart) moves to rural Washington to live with her father, where, despite being pretty and smart, she is an outcast. She becomes interested in Edward Cullen (Pattinson), who is handsome and mysterious and, oh by the way, a vampire. His whole family is. But don't worry, they're good vampires, feeding on animals instead of humans. Jacob (Lautner), a family friend, doesn't like or trust the Cullens, especially Edward. Not many people do, but Jacob's reasons run deeper: He's from a family of werewolves, and he eventually becomes one himself.
Freshman year it hurt some but the shy Condra was a youngster and it wasn't his place to say much, if anything.
A rail-only option would present only two possible east-west transportation corridors downtown: MAX on Yamhill and Morrison Streets and the Portland streetcar on Market and Mill Streets. Thus, traveling east and west north of Pioneer Square would become burdensome for the disabled and elderly since approximately 10 blocks separate the streetcar from MAX. Important bus lines, such as the Burnside route, would no longer be usable as a fareless option.

Mr. McQueen's death also leaves Gucci Group with a decision over how to manage a fashion house that was so interlinked with its founder's name. Since Gucci bought 51% of the brand in 2000, Alexander McQueen has struggled to make money, becoming profitable only as of 2007. The brand is very small compared to the group's flagship Gucci label. Still, thanks to Mr. McQueen's acclaim in the fashion world, the company was a small jewel of the Gucci Group, which is a unit of French retail-to-luxury group PPR SA. Among Gucci's other holdings are fashion houses Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and Stella McCartney in addition to jeweler Boucheron. Gucci had no comment on the future of the fashion house.

One of the gems I found was a nonvintage Quinta da Aveleda's Casal Garcia Rosé from Portugal's vinho verde region selling for $8.99. Vinho verde means "green wine," which refers to the freshness and fruitiness of the wine, not the color. Vinho verde wines tend to be slightly fizzy and light-bodied with somewhat low alcohol levels.
A fitness vow that should never be abandoned is one that strives for better reproductive health, especially if starting a family is one of your New Year's resolutions.
I think the reaction to the article reflects sadly on the way in which the issue of sexual harassment and hostile work environments are still seen in our culture: "Boys will be boys." I relate to that answer the same way I would to someone who would justify racist behavior with "White people will be white people." Ridiculous! The State of California and the federal government have made it clear that there are standards of conduct in the workplace and areas where state/federal monies are used that do not allow such behaviors. Our workplaces are not held to the same lower standard as a locker room. I would also like to point out that there are some men at my workplace for whom the "boys will be boys" cliche would simply be an unacceptable explanation. They have been as disturbed by the excesses of members of our administration and Prop. R contractors as I have been. And this is not about political correctness, it is about the right to a safe and respectful work environment for all.

"It took a while, but this is waking me up," said Nickola as her young tutor, Rose Koron, with bangs dyed a pale blue, stood at her side. It was a sentiment echoed by several of the senior graduates, who spoke of the isolation of being elderly and trying to keep up with a tech-savvy world that rarely appreciates the limitations that come with age.
David Aldridge, NBA.com: "He's not a great shooter, but he's a slasher who can explode for points coming off screens. But he'll have to fight questions about whether he was just a good player on a bad team that didn't make the NCAAs. 'They didn't play right," a Western Conference scouting director said, 'so a lot of his numbers came at the cost of winning, in my opinion.' Brooks has made an interesting impression on at least a couple of scouts. 'Whether it's intentional or not, he tries to move around the court like Kobe,' a Central Division executive said."

Not surprisingly, this has generated concern among supporters of light rail. Carl Hosticka, a legislative candidate and the Metro councilor representing that area of Washington County, said it might sound good to say that the people should have a say on the matter.
The chief architect of Monday's mischief appears to have been Mr. Miller. He was insistent on moving legislation this year to expand gambling to a sixth site in Maryland, either at Rosecroft Raceway or National Harbor in his nativePrince George's County, and to authorize table games throughout the state. The matter was the subject of little attention or debate until a gambling bill sailed out of the Senate two weeks ago. Despite the fact that the legislation had little, if any, connection to state revenues and expenditures in the next fiscal year, Mr. Miller insisted that it be considered in concert with the tax and spending bills that were must-do items for the General Assembly. Senate negotiators only agreed to a compromise with the House on income tax increases after House leaders agreed to bring a gambling bill up for a vote. As that bill's prospects dimmed on the House floor, the Senate's consideration of the tax measures slowed, and time ran out.

Bucco, whose district includes Gov. Chris Christie’s hometown of Mendham, said he is not convinced one way or the other about Corsi’s arguments. “Nowhere did I say I was going to take up this cause or do anything like that.

Jia's recent films have been increasingly dominated by their almost surreal real-world settings. "The World" (2004) takes place largely within an actual Beijing theme park containing replicas of global tourist attractions. "Still Life," which won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival in 2006, unfolds against the backdrop of a riverside town that is being prepared for flooding as part of the enormous Three Gorges hydroelectric project. His latest feature, "24 City," which premiered in competition at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday, centers on the closure of Factory 420, a sprawling state-owned industrial park in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province.

The Druze are members of a small, close-knit society that practices a little-known religion. Scattered around several Mideast countries, including Syria and Lebanon, the Druze typically embrace the government wherever they live, with no national aspirations of their own. They were early allies of Jewish independence fighters against the British, and after Israel's creation, they agreed to be subject to the military draft, betting it would earn them respect and support.
Forkin quickly put her University of Missouri undergrad and masters degrees in journalism to work reporting and writing a newsletter for Cornerstone Leadership Academy, which educates poor but gifted students from rural and war-torn areas, pointing them toward college if they're able to afford it.

Patients, too, are often on the receiving end of Landolfi’s playfulness. There’s the time he jumped up on Jim McKelvey’s wheelchair when he was eager to see him and his wife, Karleen, and give them good news about a reduction in the tumor. He even sent them pictures of his time in Disney World — complete with pictures of him walking around in a Goofy hat.

Obama has gone twice before to Afghanistan as president, most recently in December 2010, and once to Iraq in 2009. All such trips, no matter how carefully planned, carry the weight and the risks of considerable security challenges.

Happy Couple is a good bet, combining beef tenderloin and scallops with broccoli, water chestnuts and mushrooms in a mild light brown sauce. I enjoy the marriage of fresh pineapple with seafood and meats; the Pineapple Triple Crown, at once savory and sweet, is loaded with several different vegetables in a garlicky sauce laced with ginger. Seafood Double-Pan-Browned Noodles is a delicious melange of tender seafood with crunchy noodles. Among the seafood options, calamari with black bean sauce is a rich, fragrant dish. If you enjoy the musky depth of flavor created by combining cabbage, wood ear mushrooms and tiger lily flowers cooked with pork, chicken and shrimp, include an order of the Mu Shu Medley among your table's selection of dishes. The tasting menus are well combined and a good value.
I took a peek upstairs, where there's a tented rooftop bar, and a few people looked to be shivering a bit at some booths lining an inner wall. I'm sure the upstairs has the potential of being a rocking place in the patio seasons.

"I wouldn't say that we made up our mind to go in another direction. We drafted a young quarterback that we think can come in and play right away, he has that type of maturity, but we're not just going to hand him the football. There's going to be a competition as always and as it should be at every position. The quarterback position is talked about the most on any team but I love Colt McCoy. I still love Colt McCoy but I will always try and do what I think we have to do to make the team better and to improve ourselves. We had a chance to get a veteran, not a veteran although he is 28 years old, but a mature quarterback who has a chance to come in with that maturity and contribute right away. Whether that happens or not we have to let it play out. We have to let them compete. We have to let them play and see what happens. The fact that we drafted him so high means that we like him but we also like Colt McCoy and we like Seneca (Wallace) as well."
Like other government politicians during the campaign, he clung to familiar themes, citing the start of the bloody independence struggle against France that ended in 1962 — rhetoric that has little resonance with the 70 percent of the population that is under the age of 30 and afflicted by a 20 percent unemployment rate.

"The Newport Folk Festival has always sort of been the standard bearer of early music festivals," says New York rock radio personality Dennis Elsas.

Current estimates put the rate of atypical fractures at fewer than 1 in 10,000 patients who take bisphosphonates, according to the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, a specialist group of scientists and doctors. (The group has assembled a task force to study the issue in detail and will present its findings in October.) "That's a very small number compared to the people on the drug who have benefited from its fracture protection," says Dr. John Adams, who directs UCLA's Orthopaedic Hospital Research Center, a number that is likely in the tens of millions.
"Gasoline supply has tightened in recent months as a result of refining capacity shutdowns and increased U.S. gasoline exports to record high levels," and prices could rise even higher if there are further refinery shutdowns, Gheit said.
• You know how a columnist will formally voice a newspaper's support for a political candidate? Well Mike Lupica of the New York Daily News came out in favor of Woodson being elected the Knicks coach beyond this season: "Only now the Knicks are 13-4 overall under Woodson and 9-0 at home going into this game, and that means they are playing the best basketball they have played under anybody at this time of year since (Jeff) Van Gundy was the coach. Oh, you know there have been a lot of coaches since, Don Chaney and Lenny Wilkens and Larry Brown and Isiah (I’ve Never Been Fired for Basketball Reasons) Thomas and (Mike) D’Antoni... But when you add it all up, when you see the way the Knicks are clearly listening to Woodson and playing more defense than they have in such a long time in Red Holzman’s house; when you see the way Woodson has found a way to get the best out of Carmelo Anthony, well, you have to know this is the best the New York Knicks have looked and made their fans feel since Jeff Van Gundy had them in the Finals in 1999, on their way back before half his team got hurt."

Casey originally was called Casey A, bought in part as a promotion for the Kansas City Athletics, whose president also helped purchase Lady A.
The problem here is the failure to acknowledge that the photographs were an information-rich environment. When we see a Monet seascape, we are indifferent to its precise location. It's not about the place; it's about the light. But these photographs were journalism before they became art. They are our shared history, the worst thing that ever happened to the city that we admire (even if we can't afford to live there), and we want details -- not details about cameras, but details about destruction.

A few weeks after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank, scientists worried the oil slick would reach the Gulf's Loop Current, which sweeps around Florida and up the East Coast.

And hurricanes mostly avoided the region.

So my recent rebirth as a backyard gardener with a larder full of home-canned staples and milk jugs overflowing with blooms is nothing short of miraculous. Where dying cedars and diseased photinia stood a few years ago, fragrant honeysuckle, clematis, jasmine and akebia now climb.

Always a destination for fans of singer-songwriters, the annual Appel Farm festival is broadening its palette with performances by jazz-soul genre straddler Trombone Shorty and an acoustic set by rambunctious gypsy punks Gogol Bordello.

The festival will also include a crafts fair and a tent for beer and wine tasting. Which is nice for a break, but you’re there for the music, right?

Years ago, it was The Star’s blanket policy not to correct calendars or agate at all, but I consider that too draconian. Some publications decline to correct any error that is submitted by a source, and I understand the thinking there even though I don’t agree with it.

Pinkel said "it's kind of looking" as if MU will play few if any true freshmen, simply because of its depth at most spots. Among the possible exceptions are quarterback Corbin Berkstresser, who is in the hunt to back up sophomore James Franklin. Berkstresser, incidentally, has shaped up, going from 242 pounds to 224 since camp started.

So here we are. We love to catch the items that may not get much publicity (Post Preps can't be everywhere) or a few tidbits you may have missed. Of course we are at and discuss all of the major action too. We also have a network of folks who try to track our former prep stars on the college scene.

"The key to reducing unemployment is a large increase in total spending. Investors will remain on the sidelines as long as businesses continue to have enough capacity to produce more than consumers want to buy. Household spending will remain depressed as long as consumers remain fearful of losing their jobs and continue to struggle with record debt levels. And state and local governments won't resume spending while tax revenue shortfalls continue. The only other actor capable of addressing the spending shortfall is the federal government." - Robert Frank

Published in 2002, "Fireboat" remains my first choice for 9/11 books. It features the John J. Harvey, one of New York City's biggest, fastest and shiniest fireboats. She fought fires until 1995, when fireboats were deemed obsolete. She sat in the river, waiting to be sold for scrap, until a group bought and repaired her -- just for fun. The attacks on the towers called Harvey back into service. For four days and nights, she pumped water until all the fires were out.

Greg Cote, Miami Herald: "The Marlins' Jeffrey Loria inside of two years has gone from being a notoriously penurious owner publicly scolded by Major League Baseball for egregiously under-spending on player payrolls to being an owner figuratively standing on a couch in a nightclub tossing fistfuls of money into the air. Making it rain. Millions. The pursuit of superstar Albert Pujols that ended Wednesday without getting him? No problem. Miami is the biggest player in baseball free agency even without him. And the Marlins are showing no signs of ending their shopping spree. Fans beleaguered by years of shoestring payrolls surely must feel the swoon of lottery winners. So must new manager Ozzie Guillen. Turns out that multicolored ‘M' in the new logo mustn't stand for Miami, after all. Must stand for Money."
Gurwitz had asked the D.A. for the evidence in October under the public records act and was turned down under an exception that allows agencies to withhold information if it would "endanger the successful completion of the investigation." And that's what would happen if Thomas got the evidence, according to the D.A. The "premature release will not only make it difficult to impanel an impartial jury, but it may also tend to prevent a fair trial," prosecutor Rebecca Olivieri wrote in her reply in October. "Moreover ... (the release) could result in the potential interference with witnesses due to influence, even intimidation."

The crepe du jour ($12) was an utter failure, however. Billed as a lamb-and-white bean crepe, it was oversized, about the length of a man's shoe and napped with white sauce. But the filling was mush, appearing like an overworked bundle of raw lamb that was just heated through, with no beans in sight. I sent it back to the kitchen — it should never have left — and the sympathetic waiter struck it from the tab on his own initiative. For the record, I rarely send things back to the kitchen.
Nine players were issued suspensions through the first eight days of the playoffs. Those included two games for Vancouver forward Byron Bitz for a hit to the head on the Kings' Kyle Clifford and three games for Chicago's Andrew Shaw for running over Phoenix goalie Mike Smith.
In summary, we should not waste the most valuable resource that we have: smart, dedicated young people who want to contribute to America. I truly hope that all of those enthusiastic petition signers will carefully reconsider their choices next November. By voting against the in-state tuition law, you are not only destroying a young person's future, you are destroying America.
