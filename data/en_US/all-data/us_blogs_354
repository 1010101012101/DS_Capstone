Following the devastation of the Napoleonic Wars upon the European continent, the victorious leaders met in Vienna and created a peaceful balance of power to prevent the outbreak of another war. The resulting period, known as the Concert of Europe, witnessed a period of tranquility as the major European powers remained at peace with one another. This era is the focus of Hans Schenk’s study The Aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars which examines the political, diplomatic, and social aspects of Europe following the Congress of Vienna. While the author does not present an overarching thesis, the book’s main theme focuses on the alignment of popular European religious philosophies with the religious ideas of Tsar Alexander I put forth in the Holy Alliance and how domestic European disorder and international competition led to the breakdown of both the Concert of Europe and the Holy Alliance by 1825.
Mind you, the commentariat hasn’t protested the evils of property confiscation so much as it has bemoaned the fact that the land ended up in the hands of Mugabe's cronies, rather than being redistributed “fairly” to all black Zimbabweans. The process “lacked transparency,” one pointy-head complained, as though theft, transparent or clandestine, is ever aboveboard.
You're the best.
Some of this may have been me projecting my inner conflicts on the situation at the time. I accept that as a possibility. However, after understanding that God is Three in One and that He would not lead us astray and that the Church is the body of Christ on Earth. I was at a crossroads. Either: I was wrong and Christianity was a lie and I should give up the whole business, or God was intentionally deceiving us to keep us in line, or we as a Church had stopped listening and were using His Gospel to build our own fiefdoms.
Again, even if Pakistan did not know of Osama staying in Pakistan before following the CIA personnel, Pakistan should have known where Osama was staying by following these people.

In other news, I had my first mammogram today. Piece of fucking cake, girls. I was a bit worried, having heard horror stories, but honestly I think the "poke" is worse, as far as having your ladybits prodded. Austin ladies, when it's your time, go to the ARA on Wm. Cannon and ask for Cecelia. She's seen more titties than the Hedgehog. The whole procedure took maybe 10 minutes, though it will be another week or so before I hear anything back. An interesting tit(ha ha) bit: about half of the women getting their first mammogram get called back for further tests, primarily because there's nothing on record to measure their results against. So Miss Cecelia was quite clear that if I were to get called back, not to freak out.

I’m promised in this coming Tuesday’s episode the gang will team up to try and help Puck graduate high school.
But if I were the police, wanting to have undercover officers in muslim groups in the wake of 9/11, I'd have to think of a new tactic. Having a legion of trained white folks wouldn't help me be surreptitious. So, what if they openly approached muslims as police but had this nice supportive role? They would then be well placed to identify people who could become a ring of informants. They would also be highly trained and very experienced at the tricks and tactics of gaining people's trust and making them confess things they want to keep secret.

I made a conscious decision to NOT let the calls upset me, and they didn’t. Some family members showed up and we all headed to the yacht club. Everything was in order, the room was ready, the podium and microphone was where I wanted it, there were programs from what I remember with a nice picture of Rob on the front and my mother-in-law had brought a beautiful big picture of Rob in his happy days on board our sailboat. I had a guestbook and put the picture beside it, when I’d first seen the picture at my house, it made me tear up a bit.

6. And as to a review of his performance, no one has the power to review what he is doing. The international statistics of Scientology are a secret. They are never published, never talked about. Former insiders say that Scientology international statistics have been on a long term death slide since 1991. And if that seems far-fetched, ask yourself this: If the statistics really were booming, don’t you think they’d be showing them at events? You bet they would.

I have a degree in English. I’m sure that surprises a lot of people because my writing isn’t the best but I have a degree in English. With having a degree in English, I’ve had to read a lot. My emphasis in college was mainly Early to mid 19th century British literature written by women such as Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte. My senior paper topic was the 3 huge moral influences on Jane Eyre and how they affected Jane’s relationship with Mr. Rochester. With that said, I can read literature some people think is boring.
People often confuse awakening with the beginning of a period of ease, or a kind of ‘happily ever after’. There might be ease in the sense that there is less resistance, but really nothing could be further from the truth – it’s the start of the real work. Awakening is simply that initial recognition of internal power – that moment when you see the truth of your own true power, your heroic essence. After this though, the work continues. More than that, it usually gets much harder because you actually start tackling those things that have been avoided or resisted. But because you have started to take ownership of your power this is work you will begin to embrace, knowing that it is essential to your being.
that moved fast and clumsily.

And yes, it was amazing to be able to show my portfolio, Falling Into Place: Self Portraits, to national and international museum directors, curators, gallery owners and directors, educators, book and magazine publishers, photo editors, photography festival organizers, photo agency representatives, foundation directors and creative consultants. I saw 22 different reviewers in all. Their feedback was priceless, and when the invitations came, they took my breath away.
Hi! SO, did you run out and buy Twilight??? Saturday at 8am, the kids and I headed out to Wal-Mart to pick up our copy. I even splurged and bought the soundtrack. I LOVE it. Not my typical music (it's emo), but it's working for me :) I listened to it ALL day long. It's growing on me. We bought snacks, and watched the movie when we got home. I LOVED it :) I would have liked the snacks, too, but I was being good on my diet. I guess that's why I bought the generic cheese puffs, rather than the real ones - LOL! We do what we have to, I guess.
After packing up, I quickly got out from the office and sprinted toward my car. Instead of walking over this chain barrier thingy in front of the parking lot, I jumped over it like a hurdles-Olympic-champion. As always, shit happens to me when I try to be athletic.

Little more about the capitol building. The painting inside the rotunda was awesome! It appeared so 3D! Little fact, it took 3 different artists to finish this painting. The first fell to his death while painting it.
The other nine stood far off, negating even the possibility that something could happen. They stood on the fringes of life because they could not, in their hearts, find time to give thanks. Their spirits remained leprous. It is almost as if they took for granted that they would be cured, as if it were their right. Their bodies were now whole, their souls still marked with decay.

I did not let him help me move, even though I thought about it long and hard. Several weeks ago, he started stalking my profile, sending me ":)" and ";)" via the email system. Not much to respond to, buddy. So, I've ignored...I mean, if you can't put a sentence together - why should I be bothered? About a week ago I got this: "So, you obviously don't want me the way that I want you. I've tried so hard to get your attention and start over. Please contact me!" A-huh.

She majorly offended my husband, when I asked her over she said ‘could your husband assemble some flatpack for me?’. I asked my husband who was offended by the assumption that I couldn’t do this for her. It’s sexist he said to make such assumptions. I am reminded that I have built furniture from scratch with wood. I offer to help. No she says, there are little nails to hold the back in place it requires finesse with the hammering. I really want your husband to do it. He is offended that she thinks he would marry someone who cannot assembly Ikea flatpack.

We should develop a sacred space both within us and in our own home environment in which our spiritual experiences, the events in our spiritual life, can be honored, nurtured and cherished. If we have a good vessel, the experiences will come and we will be able to move through them. If our vessel is contaminated or broken, even the best experiences will not be able to really enter into us. If our vessel is prepared, we may experience a deepening peace and bliss without needing more dramatic experiences to keep us on the path.

Residents enjoy the peaceful neighborhood and its great amenities, including a community pool with a cabana, four tennis courts, a playground, and a gazebo to enjoy the beautiful outdoors.
My boys love to load the washing machine. In fact sometimes they fight over who gets to load the washer, because loaded the dryer apparently is not as much fun. To make it fair to both parties I have had one load the washer and then when they were done take all the clothes out and have the other boy load the washer again. You want to be fair right?
Again I’d be ok with this because once again who WOULDN’T want one of these?

The idea of unintended consequences dates back at least to Adam Smith, the Scottish Enlightenment, and consequentialism. Adam Smith’s “invisible hand,” the most famous metaphor in social science, is an example of a positive unintended consequence. Smith maintained that each individual, seeking only his own gain, “is led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention,” that end being the public interest. “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, or the baker, that we expect our dinner,” Smith wrote, “but from regard to their own self interest.”
A full line contained many clues as to the owner’s occupation. Heavy, coarse work clothes and long handles indicated a farmer, mechanic or mill worker in residence. Cowboy shirts, bandannas and Levi’s pointed to a rancher’s abode. White shirts, dress pants and undershirts suggested a banker, shopkeeper or clerk made his home within.
9. The process may have been very democratic but the objective of choosing a leader by majority vote has not been achieved. The losers must also remember that when they win they same can happen to them. In other words a democratic contest can only lead to the break-up of the party (I am speaking from experience).
-Don't say, "It's God's Will." Even if we are members of the same congregation, unless you are a cleric and I am seeking your spiritual counseling, please don't presume to tell me what God wants for me. Besides, many terrible things are God's Will, that doesn't make them less terrible.

Remove ALL foliage below the water line. Foliage rots more quickly than the stems, creating bacteria which is the enemy of every cut flower. (The wide leaf I added will contribute to bacteria growth, however, it will decay more slowly than your standard leaf because it has a waxy surface.)
I strongly suspect that 2012 is likely to be a bit of a new dawn for beer as the press and recognition people in the industry have been madly craving is slowly coming through. Trade publications (yes the ones with wine and cocktails in) have been gradually increasing their coverage and savvy entrepreneurs are cutting swaths through the traditional image of the beer drinker and leaving old stereotypes by the wayside.

There is no end to the amount of price inflation we can expect, food prices will surely be the next to skyrocket on our shopping list for reasons to be explained in our next issue. Judeo-Christians as a group are most responsible for our dollar dilution because it is they that supported the wars for which all these dollars were wasted on killing people.
Been doing too much of that. Time to get back to reality and face the facts. I’ve been ignoring the facts for too long. Made myself into a joke. At least it felt good to dream. For some time. Now I don’t think it will be good in the long run so even if it feels bad in the moment it will be for better later to let the dreams go and focus on what is real. Don’t have to be all bad to do that even if it might seem like it at first. So that’s what I’ll do.

Crop day. Cassava is all we can see or think about after spending the day neck deep in the crop.

Then it was off to the far reaches of the Eastern Providence of the country to work with the Rwanda Rural Rehabilitation Initiative (RWARRI) on crop quality management protocol. Don’t worry…it was really exciting.

There are other readers available, including Google Books, CloudReader, Bluefire Reader, Stanza and (of course) iBooks, but my preference at this point is the Kindle reader. All of these readers are really front-ends for online book stores and they all have nearly the same functionality. If you want to transfer PDF files to one of these other readers, I recommend using DropBox. Copy the PDF to your DropBox folder, then select it on your device, and choose a program from the “open with” menu. Alternatively, you can copy the files using iTunes.

For a lot of the workout, I was thinking about that postcard. It’s promoting the American Lung Association’s Distance Swim Challenge in August – an open water swimming event in the Pacific Ocean. I’ve never swum for exercise in the ocean (I’ve only frolicked and gallivanted) and the idea is very intriguing. The ALA sponsored the skyscraper stair climb I completed a few weeks ago, and their events are well-organized and well-run, so that part doesn’t concern me. It’s the actual swimming.

The authors used a sample of 29 males and 30 females view video tapes of interviews. The people being interviewed were all rated to be equally attractive, and all talked about the same events through a simple script. In this first version of the study, the emotions were only anger or sadness relating to a stressful event. To be clear, each interview really only differed in the emotional story. Each person watched all four of these interviews. One interview had a man with a sad story, another with a man who had an angry story, another with a woman with a sad story, and finally a female with an angry story. The presentation of these videos was randomized between participants of course.

In a food processor or blender combine the flours, baking powder, cocoa, salt, sugar and baking soda. Add margarine and pulse a few times until the mixture is combined, you should still be able to make out the margarine pieces but they should be very small. Add the chocolate chips and the milk/vinegar mixture and pulse until combined. You can either roll the dough out and use cutters to get them in a nice circular shape or you can just go ahead and form them with your hands and put them directly on your prepared baking sheet (you should get about 8 of them). Bake for about 10-14 minutes at 450 degrees.
So thanks, Peter, for Plan B. I'm already on the track of a couple of studios, and it'll be easier to compile my dossier back in Berlin. Meanwhile, a miracle could happen, and I'm open to it. But I think that my mistake, if I could be said to have made one, was in misjudging the very laid-back tempo that attracts me to this place and thinking that I could score an apartment as quickly as I could in Berlin.

Nice looking light yet foggy amber color with a slight head at the top. Decent lacing as the beer was drank. Big hop smell of citrus, flowers and a slight hint of caramel malt.

"Dr. Doyle describes this parish as consisting of a portion of the Abbacy of St. Abban, and of the parish of Rathaspick.

It is not referred to by name in the Registry of 1704, in the Returns of 1731 and 1766, or in Dean Skelton's list of parishes. The ancient parish of Rathaspick, as has been already stated, extended into not only this and the adjoining modern parish of Ballyadams, but also into that of Clough, in the diocese of Ossory..."

If you buy the beans dried, soak them overnight to reduce cooking time. Rinse and drain them thoroughly. For 1 cup of beans, use 3 ¼ cups water.

“The Indigo Evolution” is a documentary that attempts to answer the question – Are these ‘Indigos’ only the fanciful notions of a few individuals embracing new-age, metaphysical beliefs, or is there real evidence that they truly do exist? Most importantly, why are they here and how can we help them achieve their goal of creating a world based upon the laws of compassion and peace? Interviews with some of the most profound children on the planet today combined with discussions with authorities in the fields of medicine, psychology, education, philosophy, and religion will provide information for the viewer to draw their own conclusions to these questions.

Gold Medal is the sixth album by The Donnas, released in 2004. The Donnas returned with a different drive on this album. Their earliest releases clung tightly to the Ramones' ethic of three power chords and a chunky rhythm, but Gold Medal veers into a '70s psychedelia feel, hinting at a more introspective and melodic feel. Mostly they were going for a more mature sound here. On this album they decided to drop their stage names (Donna A, Donna R., etc) and used their real names to present an image appropriate for the more mature sound that they had adopted on the new album. The basslines have never been more intricate, tambourines and handclaps come in at all the right times, and the whole album sports the most terrific production of any Donnas up to this time. Unfortunately as of now the original lineup of the Donnas is no more. Torry Castellano who was the tiny powerhouse drummer announced on July 9, 2010, via the band's website that due to her continued shoulder problems she would have to retire from drumming and performing with The Donnas. Here is the message she posted on the website.
My final thoughts? I would eat this again, but probably not use the entire packet of sauce. I would love to be able to try out some of the other Wanchai Ferry varieties which include Orange Chicken, Shrimp Lo Mein, Spicy Garlic Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken...all with NO added MSG. Also keep watching for Kung Pao Chicken and Szechuan Style Chicken, which should be arriving soon.

I really like how this nail look turned out and it was extremely easy to do too. I didn't want to overdo it with the bunnies so I just added two bunnies on my nails instead off doing them on all my nails. I paired the design with Pink Friday from the OPI Nicki Minaj Collection and I think it looks really cute, what do you think? :)
Look away now if you’re a fan of rabbits or have them as pets, as this post probably isn’t for you. Some may say it’s cruel, even perverse to cook up a rabbit dish on a bank holiday weekend which has for its mascot a giant Easter egg delivering rabbit. Well, I had rabbits as pets when I was younger and they bit me a lot, leaving me with very little sympathy towards the creatures, so consider this revenge PJ, Funny Bunny and the er, one whose name I can’t remember! Plus, the Easter bunny brought me no eggs this year, apparently I’m “too old” or something so its fair to say I’m not a fan. So todays dish was rabbit bolognese from Jamies Great Britain (which I’m now renaming Easter Bunny bolognese) and had me up at 7am on Easter Monday to put it in the oven, because this bad boy takes 12 hours to cook. Yes, 12, I know. But after 20 minutes prep which involved browning some bacon and then chucking in a whole rabbit, veg, herbs, tinned tomatoes and beer I wisely went back to bed to enjoy the last day of the long weekend. Which meant waking up at 10 to the flat filled with this amazing aroma that made me wish it could have been cooked in half the time, as the cereal I had for breakfast really didn’t suppress the appetite this smell was creating. After 12 hours, Jamie instructed me to let it cool for a little while and then to don a pair of rubber gloves and start scrunching all the veg and the meat so that it turned into mush (the onions and veg were all put in whole at the start), and also to remove all the bones from the rabbit. This was tricky, as even after cooling down for half hour it was still very hot, and no matter how much you look, you will find small bits of bone while you’re eating the bolognese. I could have left it to cool for a little while longer, but by this time it was 7:30 and I was very hungry. Heat won’t stop me when my tummy’s rumbling! The verdict? Well it really wasn’t too impressive considering it took so long to cook and nearly burnt through the rubber gloves to my poor hands. While I do like Jamie Olivers recipes in general, sometimes I think he forgets that people aren’t chefs and don’t always have time/inclination/money to cook his long winded recipes. I don’t know about everyone else, but if I’m going to have to smell deliciousness for 12 hours and then nearly burn my hands, I’m going to want the taste to be just as good as the smell. At the end of the day he’s a chef and you can tell this when comparing his recipes to home cooks like Nigella. Nigellas’ recipes keep working, busy people fully in mind, whereas I feel Jamie gets so caught up in his own passion for food that he forgets not everyone is so enthusiastic, or if they are, they still aren’t chefs and want things to be simple and tasty. Don’t even get me started on Jamies 30 Minute Meals book, I could be here all day. I’ll save that for another post though, possibly when I cook from that very book. At the end of the day, I’ve made much better bolognese sauces or ragus from scratch in the past and it didn’t take as long and tasted a great deal nicer. There is absolutely loads of this left as well, which I’m a bit gutted about as I don’t have any desire to eat it again, but will not throw away. It’ll probably end up in the freezer for several years now, shame.

I am a baking machine! I LOVE to bake, but I'm the only one in the house who really loves baked goods. However, since Grandpa has recently been sick and lost weight, we now have to fatten him up!

Unlike Anne's iconic diary, which obviously ended just before the annexe's occupants were found and taken away, Dogar extends her novel right through to Auschwitz and beyond - and this is where I thought she really excelled. Peter's whole narrative is precipitated by his flood of memories as he lies in the sick bay at Mauthausen, deliriously waiting for the call to wake up and start another day in hell. Between chapters there are occasional interjections from the dying boy to remind the reader that this is not going to end well. After they are captured Peter describes the horrendous train journey out of Amsterdam, the separation from his mother and the Frank women, how he learned to survive in the camps, and how he lost his father to the gas chambers. I could barely read the last twenty pages or so, I was crying so hard.

I can't imagine what made the owners splurge for the new signage. I doubt the drunks inside where complaining about how the distressed storefront reflected on their image.
So it is that in today’s largely secular society, thousands still continue to turn to ancient texts like the Tibetan and Egyptian Books of the Dead for consolation and inspiration. Like the world’s other great sacred works, these Books of the Dead offer wisdom, hope, and comfort. But because they’re so old, the material they present needs to be seen within a modern context in order to be truly useful. If “What happens to the soul at death?” remains perhaps the single most important question we can ask, then whatever answer we find should incorporate not just ancient wisdom, but also the fruits of modern experience. The Modern Book of the Dead does just that.

Happy Monday! Brrrr very cold this past weekend with lots of ice mixed with snow. . Needless to say I didn't go anywhere! My body doesn't like cold and makes me well aware of it.

Ellen came to visit again and we discussed names....I had no scientific proof that we were having a girl; I just KNEW it. She like Maren. I liked Kiki. The Spouse started throwing Erica in the mix that had already included Paige. I kept trying to get him to reconsider Siri....we landed back at Kiki. We ate supper. I was checked....a 3. I called my Mom, "I'M a 3!!!" she said. Patience was wearing thin.

Go ahead and rant and rave, I can't stop you anyway.

That's a good motivator to keep pushing through the workouts and sticking to my diet. I'm still debating if I want to do daily blogs like I used to. I may just update weekly and post when something interesting happens. I guess we'll see. I will post my measurements and possibly pics at some point today.
I’ve been going to Monmouth Park as long as I can remember; with my parents when I was a kid, as a teenager when I finally could bet on my own, and now as an adult with my own family. I enjoy Monmouth Park the way it is. But, on the other side of this coin, I have been to other tracks that have casinos, such as Yonkers and Hollywood and think they’re better. I’ve been to Foxwoods in Connecticut, (that’s not a race track but you’ll understand my thinking in a moment) that has gambling, top-notch restaurants, luxury shopping, stage shows, etc. and it’s a fantastic place to getaway. The same could be said for Monmouth Park in the future. It could become a year-round vacation destination.
Oh, the woman with the two small kids called me yesterday to wish me a happy Easter. She got a hold of a relative that lives in another part of the country and she is going to live with them, at least for a while. I am happy for her and her kids. She feels bad taking them out of their school in the middle of the year, but it has to be better than living in a shelter. She is taking the bus in the next few days after she gets the money he sent her to get the tickets. She sounded much calmer when I talked to her yesterday. I am glad that I was able to help her while she was figuring out what to do next.

Often times I feel so unappreciated, as a woman’s work in the house never ends, especially if there are kids in the picture. So I decided to share Zig’s article with you.
Low-income kids earn higher test scores when they attend school alongside middle-class kids, while the test scores of privileged children are impervious to the influence of less-privileged peers. So when college-educated parents pull their kids out of public schools, whether for private school or homeschooling, they make it harder for less-advantaged children to thrive.

Every single one of those breweries I mention there has a strong, core range of sessionable beers that stand proudly as such on the bar - from London Pride to Hophead and Pint to Pale Rider every single one of these beers is award-winning and, more pertinent to Nodder's argument, profitable, but they are complemented by limited release beers like Brewer's Reserve or a limited release Imperial Stout here and there - which is a sound business model.

I'm so pleased with the 2 solutions I've found for my ribbon and rubber that I want to share them with you, but I've decided to do a whole series of how I've solved some of my craft room issues, starting with this one about converting your rubber stamps from wood mounted to unmounted. Thanks to the awesome new storage cases from Stampin' Up! I've started umounting all of my stamps and reducing their storage to about 1/4 of the space they took before. This is possibly the BIGGEST space saving change I could have made, and I can't recommend it enough! It's also allowed me to store similar stamp sets together so I can plan my projects more efficiently.

Another good thing about the novel is the ease of reading it brings- well spaced lettering and smooth language- makes reading sort of uninterrupted and the 400 odd pages did not seem a task, really. The narrative is quite linear. Which is a good thing I guess.

I get sores in my nose and mouth. Weakness, fatigue, headaches, blurred vision, dizziness and increased pain in limbs can all happen during a flare. These are signs that you are having a flare, and you need to notify your doctor. Other symptoms of lupus include hair loss; weight loss or weight gain; allergy to the sun; extreme fatigue; painful and/or swollen joints; fever; edema of hands, face, feet, or legs; butterfly rash on face; anemia; pleurisy (my first round was three years ago); tendency to get pneumonia; Raynaud’s; and Sjogren’s syndrome. It causes inflammation of the kidneys, liver, pancreas and intestines. It can cause inflammation around the heart (pericarditis) along with other complications of the heart. It causes problems with blood sugar (mine bottoms out). It can even cause brain inflammation. Lupus causes high blood pressure. Because of kidney trouble, you can require dialysis and even kidney transplants. Inflammation of the nervous system and brain can and does cause memory problems, confusion, headaches and strokes.

3) It has complete crossover appeal. The main character, Naomi, is a teen for sure. But the main love interest is not. He's older and he's into way more serious dealings than what subject to sign up for at school and who his latest crush should be.

In conversation with some friends I realized there is one buzz phrase (not exclusive to philanthropy) that drives me batty. That term?

George Anastaplo, Professor of law at Loyola Chicago School of Law and lecturer in liberal arts at the University of Chicago, may well be the Energizer Bunny of American constitutional scholars. His academic career began in 1964, and by the 1990s his scholarly output was sufficiently prodigious and noteworthy to be celebrated in a two-volume festschrift (Murley, Stoner and Braithwaite 1992) and a collection of essays (building upon an APSA panel – sponsored by the Claremont Institute – devoted to Anastaplo’s contributions) in the 1997 volume of POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEWER. Many would have taken these honors as occasions to retire, or at least slow down, but that has not been the case with Anastaplo. In the past decade, he has produced, in addition to the volume under review, six other books, a seventh (REFLECTIONS ON FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND THE FIRST AMENDMENT) forthcoming this year, several other volumes in preparation, and nearly a dozen articles to add to scores of previous ones.

I’m finally back in the air. I started my « summer » 6 months contract this week. I’m really happy to be back at work, even though I’m exausted. The first week is always the most tiring as my body needs to get used again to be back in the air. That means feeling a bit sick in the plane and lots of sleep to catch. I had several night flight too. Hopefully no jetlag as we don’t go far.

Over the centuries, invading armies have habitually sought to possess, ravage and despoil the enemy's womenfolk, as a means of humiliating and breaking an adversary or celebrating a victory over him. This may sound far fetched, but just look around at the various conflicts which are happening at the moment, such as in Sudan, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, in all of these horrors the invading armies invariably target the indigenous tribe's womenfolk. Rape has become a weapon of war, however, it is not just the act of rape which makes it such and effective and popular weapon, it is the psychology behind it which is so devastating.

Running (if we can call it that) on the eliptical, staring through the glass doors, off into the distance, I could see myself back in the summer of the waning days of my early life. Driving home late at night. The windows open. The roof open. The cool, humid night in Ft. Lauderdale. It was the summer of '88 and I was back at home. Working two jobs. Working harder than I'd ever worked before. But loving it just the same. All my friends were home that summer. Indeed, 1988 was the last summer we all came home. Sometime the previous Fall, I'd signed up with Columbia House and ordered 12 tapes for cheap. And because I liked Magic Power, I included Triumph in my order.
Somewhere on the web I saw a picture of gold scissors. I immediately thought of my purple scissors and how great they would look decked out in gold. So instead of running out to buy a pair, I grabbed the painters tape and spray paint and got right on it! I also grabbed some staples and paper clips and gave them a quick coat of gold. Easiest DIY project I've ever done! And I just love the way they look in my pencil jar. You could easily switch up the gold for another great color of your choice!

The book of Esther begins with control issues, as King Xerxes realizes with all of his wealth, power, prestige, and palace living that he can’t make his beautiful wife Queen Vashti, as ordered, wear the royal crown and come to the feast.

Everything moves so fast. One of my colleagues recently complimented me on being proactive. In response, I informed him that I always feel three weeks behind. And I was warned that as the release date approached, things would move at a frantic pace. What an understatement! Once again, I am humbled by the process. And I’m humbled by the warm support so many have given. Your patience has been tested, and the day has finally come for us all.
And she heard him, but she tested him with a fake curl of the lip: "Um, come again, Sir?"

So I’m frantic and running around because I need to help this bird! And then, I’m like I’m in a tank top…I need sleeves! So I run to my sleeves! But them I’m all like but hands…my mittens aren’t thick enough! uh….figure out later! Maybe I should poke the bird! That’ll free it!
Fast forward, and it was time to attend the Easter parade. It was held on the last day of school, a Friday, so both O and I headed over to the big new hall after we dropped M at her classroom. O was rambling on and on about the songs that M was going to sing, he was sure that they were songs about monsters, and could we please go home? He was happy enough, so when he buried his head in my chest and burst in to tears as the music started, I was surprised. Not shocked, because after all, I am the Mum who has always had crying, sobbing kids at every Christmas concert or event. I'm used to it. I was beginning to wonder if I was going to have to leave my seat and take him out, but a little box of chocolate teddies seemed to sort him out. I managed to turn him around to face the stage and then he was entranced. Loved the cute songs and the actions. M has changed, she's not the sobbing kid any more, she's completely in to it, loving it and smiling wide. Love that.

Form the butter into a ball and refrigerate, covered. I can't tell you how long it will last since I divided mine in 6 equal pieces, 1 ounce each and wrapped them in plastic wrap. (1 ounce of butter=2 Tbsp.) They went into the freezer.
Yet in a 2011 interview with comedian Jon Stewart (in which Stewart attributed his comedic success partly to peoples' disappointment with the news media), Fox anchor Chris Wallace said: "I don't think our viewers are the least bit disappointed with us.

Hervir mucha agua con sal en una cacerola grande, verter la pasta y cocinar. El tiempo de coccion depende de la marca pero en general es de 8 a 10 minutos. Probala despues de 6 minutos para ver como va la coccion. Debe quedar al dente, un poco durita pero gomosa. Una vez hecha, colar la pasta y dejar enfriar en un bowl grande con un chorrito de aceite de oliva para que no se pegue. Reservar.
It mesures 96"x96" so it's my biggest quilt. I think I'm going to take a break from queen sized quilt for a while. I still have one to bind and then I'm done with big big quilts. For now at least. But I must say it's pretty satisfying. I feel like I accomplished something !
Jesus does not call men to repent one time of their sins then return to the same sinful lifestyle. He does not teach men to perform rituals to save their souls. He offers Salvation to man in exchange for the soul of that man. Each man who accepts the Salvation that Christ offers is expected to count the cost of his decision to follow Christ and change his lifestyle so it carries the image of it’s Lord.
I wander about the parking lot nonchalantly pushing the cart up and down the rows of parked cars looking for my little Honda. Looking left and right before I remember I took TOTT's car! In the immortal words of Homer: D'oh! (of The Simpsons, natch.

I thought about my blog. Where is this taking me? (is it supposed to take me anywhere?) I find this yet another creative outlet where I don't follow anyone's design direction but my own. Should I keep blogging? I smile. I can do this.
“Paul tends not to like anything I do and then gradually warms to it, though not always. He is one of two or three people who think it’s a complete waste of time in every sense, that there’s nothing happening, there’s nothing of interest, there’s a passable impression of Stewart Lee’s style, there are a few jokes about comedy which are amusing but there’s no substance to it, there’s nothing happening… What point is it I am trying to make? Why don’t I just fuck off? That kind of stuff.
Next I headed out to The Fox and Hound again for a beer and some pool with a few friends. I ordered a beer they had listed as Paulaner Seasonal since I had so enjoyed that Paulaner Hefe-Weizen last weekend. It wasn't quite as tasty to me, but it was definitely different and still pretty good. Unfortunately, I can't figure out which Paulaner beer it was.

With these and other changes to the memory interface specification, SoC designers will need a new tool set to add DDR4 memory interfaces to their designs. That’s why Cadence has introduced a DDR4 IP package and design kit now—because SoC designers preparing early designs that incorporate DDR4 memory need to start now. The Cadence DDR4 offerings include a DDR4-enhanced memory controller (based on the existing, configurable SDRAM controller Cadence obtained when it purchased Denali Software last year), hard and soft DDR4 PHYs, design kits for board- and package-level DDR4 design, and verification IP and memory models for DDR4 memory.

The revelation isn’t surprising since the 3D trend seems to be trailing off. HTC and LG both rushed to release 3D smartphones last year, including the HTC Evo 3D and the LG Optimus 3D, but they have since replaced their flagships with 2D versions. The emphasis has returned to increasing resolution, something that’s still lacking with 3D display technology.
Candy holders- Some of the containers I used were from the dollar store. The glass candy jars with lids I got from Oriental Trading Company. I also used doodlebug designs plastic ribbon containers for some of the candy. I wrapped patterned paper around the containers and used some Maya Road felt stickers as accent. I filled these with different candies that people could snack on and each jar could be taken home as a gift as well.

Because of the cloudy skies, which might I say were not in the forecast, I decided it would be best to decorate inside only. I wanted to ensure that Wyatt's shadow box, the one Brian built, was the center of the party.

One of the best stories to come out of the mostly dreadful fifth season, "The Masks" is a neat little EC-style tale of dark vengeance with the vile villains getting their just desserts.

You drink five bottles a day — 2 ounces with breakfast (oatmeal with fruit mixed in), 4 ounces with lunch, 6 ounces in the afternoon, 3 ounces with dinner and 6 ounces at bedtime. We’ve been working on getting you to drink water from a sippy cup with your morning snack of fruit and cheerios, but you like to chew on the cup more than drink from it. We’re still trying to find a cup that works for you, but I think we may need to put formula in it instead of water to see if it’s just the water that you don’t like. So far, you haven’t tasted juice — we’re trying to keep in that way as long as we can!

But if I turn and open my sails to the winds, will I be carried gently along, or will I be hurled forward out of control reaching out to grasp something to hold on to?

Now, there is a public librarian who writes dispatches for McSweeney’s Internet Tendency, a favored magazine of the young literati. “Unshelved,” a comic about librarians — yes, there is a comic about librarians — features a hipster librarian character. A librarian who writes for McSweeney's? REALLY?!!!? What's next? Popcorn at movie theaters? Also, THERE'S A COMIC ABOUT LIBRARIANS?!!? You are seriously blowing my mind right now. That's, like, totally impossible to comprehend. What's next? A comic about a talking beagle who sleeps on his dog-house and occasionally flies in WWII planes?

However, if your name is William Walton, you might object to such a road based on the fact that you don't like new roads, regardless of the benefits it'll actually bring.

The actually tie-dying was a little chaotic. We went down early, wanting to make sure that we got there before the die ran out. Well, they weren't quite prepared for the huge rush of families they got. There weren't enough rubber bands, and the dye wasn't ready yet. They were making a turmeric dye which had to boil before it was ready. It all worked out though. The kids were super excited to do their tie-dye, partly thanks to a tie-dye video game we have on our ip.ad, but they stayed reasonably patient. Also, thanks to that same video game, I was able to offer some advice to other families for how to fold their shirts. Here we are, finally waiting in line to dye our shirts.

Every year I update the manual I write for the multimedia courses I teach in high school. I started writing my own curriculum because I couldn’t find any one textbook or resource that I liked. Instead, I scoured the web in search of the best projects, tutorials, and guides I could find, and wrote the ones I couldn’t find myself. I started with the production manual available online from NYU’s Tisch film school. What I ended up with is an excellent and thorough resource for any computer multimedia teacher to use in their classroom.
All men who walk in the flesh and promote “Jesus” often do more harm to the work of sharing the gospel in public than good. Maybe it would have been better to help an old lady over the street and just said “Praise Jesus” to the bystanders.

The theatre is the best place to spend weekends with our family. In fact our theatre experiences have now far more improved due to the large number of multiplexes. A home theatre system can be called a miniature theatre. It is said so because you could get the same experience that you derive from cinema theatres. So it can be said home theatres are the place to hangout within our homes. It offers luxury within the comfort of our home and you need not go outside to spend time.

So, I shall step out into the dangerous world today. I have a battle to face this morning. I am so fortunate to have a boss who supports me. I will need her support today. After next Wednesday I will have approximately two weeks of relative peace. I will get to go out and about and meet with people and work on real things. I will get to sit down and actually think about my work instead of rushing to meet deadlines. And then it will begin again....

Empower yourself by breaking bad habits and starting healthy new ones. I started my cleanse as soon as I got back. Start by removing the inflammatory foods that contribute to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, cholesterol, IBS, thyroid disorders, joint pain and acid reflux just to name a few. Inflammatory foods include dairy, gluten, soy, alcohol, artificial sweeteners (except xylitol and stevia), sugar (which is as addicting as cocaine) and processed or boxed foods. Eat like caveman or cavewoman, which means more vegetables, low glycemic fruits (berries), lean, unprocessed meats, and high fiber, low glycemic whole grains such as quinoa and roasted sweet potatoes. Or if you want to be really strict paleo, don’t eat grains or beans, just starchy veggies. Shop the perimeter of the store and stay out of the “diet aisle”! It’s all processed and high in sugar! Have you looked at the label? Sugar is usually the first ingredient! Ugh!! I know what you are thinking…”But Brandi, it’s fat free and only 100 calories.” Yes, but when you eat the whole box, like I have done because it’s “diet food” and easy to do, it’s now 600 calories and leaves you craving more. Remember: sugar is like crack!! They just confirmed that on 60 minutes a couple of weeks ago. Your body actually needs healthy fats for good health and to feel satiated. If your meals include protein, fiber & a little fat, you will control your blood sugar better, feel satisfied longer, and not need to snack on junk. It’s amazing how great you feel when you eat healthy, balanced meals such as grilled chicken with quinoa and roasted vegetables. And if you like to eat out, Piatti’s and Chow in Danville and Lark Creek in Walnut Creek offer healthy options so it’s easy to keep it clean and not sound high maintenance when you order. When there’s no time to eat a whole foods meal, drink a tasty, satisfying, balanced shake!
Except I wasn’t interested.
The last song Whitney Houston sang in public was “Jesus Loves Me.” At her funeral, friends and family talked about her faith in Christ. No one knows another person’s heart. But if the stories of her sincere Christian faith are true, then we know that her faith struggled through rocky soil.
At this Skadi too despaired and wondered what to do, she knew that she could not leave her home forever but knew that she could not keep the man she loved from the sea. Eventually they agreed that they should spend nine nights in Storm Home and nine nights in Njord’s Sea Home. So the two made the journey back to Asgard and Sea Home. This was how they lived for a few years, traveling back and forth between the two, always moving, never settled. Each of them at times happy and at times sad, but rarely were they happy together despite their desperate love for one another, for one of them was always homesick. Eventually, Skadi became more and more miserable, and Njord, noticing this and not bearing for her to be unhappy either asked what was wrong. ‘I cannot sleep here,’ she cried, ‘the sea is always restless, the gulls are always mewling and the ships creak in and out of the ship yard, day and night. There is no peace in this place and I can stand it no longer. I must go home.’ Njord held her close and they both cried, knowing that they could not live together, knowing they could not bear to be apart, understanding how hopeless it was. So they agreed to stay married, but to live apart, Skadi in Storm Home and Njord in Sea Home and so it must always be; for though summer and winter will always make their sacred dance, bringing the cycles of growth and stillness to the earth, they cannot exist in one place together, just as sea and mountain cannot.

We decided that we would try to make the switch more at home by adding a light fixture over the shower with the wires running to the same switch. However, during our trip to Lowes we realized that we were going to end up spending a lot more money, time, and sweat to install two separate fixtures-- and then having it probably end up ugly. So, we took a little stroll down to the all in one fan/light section and picked out one we liked.
The actual position of women in Libya is not a topic on which I have reliable information. Certainly, the young ladies in Gaddafi’s bodyguard detail must have a pretty cushy life – a woman who walks around with a semi-automatic weapon slung over her shoulder doesn’t have to take crap from anyone. As for the rest of the female population, who really knows? The Colonel likes to present himself as a progressive revolutionary type, but men in that part of the world are used to wearing the trousers and hogging the poufs. If a wife gets too lippy with her husband she might find herself being bartered for a goat at the souk.

I'm a pretty good researcher, and care enough about education to know exactly where to look. There are a number of really useful data and info sites out there (this one is my favorite), but there is no real way to quantify budgetary changes in specific programs on a state or national level. You can find information on how much states and districts spend in categories such as "instruction", "transportation", and "special education", either on a total or per-pupil basis; you can even map that against the types (grants, taxes) and sources (Federal, state, or local) of funding, which is cool if not particularly instructive. If you search hard enough, you can even find information about particular programs in particular districts - for example, the school districts around Dallas-Fort Worth average a 419:1 ratio of students to guidance counselors, against a recommended ratio of 250:1. But what I was looking for simply was not there. Really, in some perverse way, I did not expect it to be there.
Today will require some looking back to find the answers to this next question. Again we encourage you to work through these seven questions both on a personal and organizational level. Again, as always, we use the term organization here to mean any group of people that you are a part of. This could be a business, a not for profit, church, service club, a community or even your family. Any group of people that you belong to.
I also guess you're wondering about my progress with the cleanse. Well, I'm not quite done - these are my last two days, so I'll hold final judgement. What I WILL say is I feel incredible. More to come on that, too.
Then you get to my twins...the two that changed our lives in very different ways...born at 23 weeks...a whole 17 weeks early! They taught us how to face challenges of chronic illnesses and special needs. How to deal with a death of a child and the grief that follows it...all the while still "swimming" for the sake of the surviving twin the even years later is struggling daily, the other beautiful kids at home that had to deal with losing a brother and having the other sick constantly dealing with the special needs that he has...and finally for our marriage...because no one talks about the stress that loss and sickness can wreck havoc on a marriage. We are stronger, grew closer because of it!

The Government in my opinion should eliminate tax breaks with big business and create it's own labor force, hiring big businesses best and brightest until big business gets the message that They need to give back to the country not just take.

I’m unusually relaxed for still not being any closer to having things ready for Christmas- maybe taking some time off for Santa yesterday did mama some good too! I’m sure you moms have lots of stories of pictures with Santa. Wouldn’t that be a funny link party idea?!

Alice ran, away from the path and after them. She wasn’t able to explain it, but she had a compulsion that swelled deep inside her to be near them, to touch them, to follow them wherever they led her. It could have been that she was just grateful of the company in the forest, but she couldn’t say. She ran, not looking where she was going. The trees were becoming a blur of green and brown, but her way ahead was clear. Alice could see a third creature in front, much bigger, alongside the other two; she needed to see it, to find out what it was, to be close to it.

I am not making any startling observations when I say children can be cruel, only to grow into elevated states of viciousness as they enter adulthood. If one has ever been brutalized growing up, certainly, they can spot on to what I'm on about. For such creatures, I've always loved the Mandarin term, si lai nan jen, which is that language's term for bully, but literally means; stern in appearance, weak on the inside. Having been bullied rather badly growing up, I find that term to be apt.

After a screening of The Housemaid, Kim tells the audience that filmmaking was his hobby, and that he was an amateur director, by which he meant that he was completely self-taught and had no business sense whatsoever. He went on to say that it was thanks to the support of his wife, who produced his films, that he was able to pursue his filmmaking career. It was when as many as 300 films and 1000 videos a year began to inundate the market that Kim discontinued making movies. In 1997, he said, Koreans, maybe sick of watching American films, were starting to watch Korean films again. This documentary also contains the same footage found on Kim Ki-young on Kim Ki-young.

Yes, the thought of overhauling your diet may feel overwhelming but remember the old saying, “If there is no change, then there is no change.” If you want your health and your quality of life to significantly improve, then you must make some fundamental changes to create that new reality. The key words are “quality of life.” Lifestyle changes are less about future health than about improving the quality of your daily life right now.
e) For ‘dropping’ parachute minister on Penang without ANY vote of any sort. NEPOTISM at it’s worst is why we have LGE as Chief Minister today. In a truly democratic political party (i.e. at 66.6% quorums or a one-man one-vote for all Penangites system (like USA’s presidential elections), no way would LGE be Chief Minister.

Responding to a very tough question of whether he found it difficult to accept the fact that his wife might be fantasized by so many men, David Weber said, “I guess, when you do something which deviates from a prescribed path, you weigh the pros and cons and get equipped to deal with the consequences.”
Nevertheless, during her tenure, the relationship between the two schools was sometimes strained. For example, Schechter put its foot down in March 2008, when several JTS students studying there sought to mark the one-year anniversary of the change in JTS’s admissions policy. The students invited Yonatan Gher, then the incoming director of the gay community center Jerusalem Open House, to speak about his experience as a gay man in the Israeli Conservative movement. But after a dispute with Ramon and others in the administration, the students were forced to hold the event off campus.
I sat in service seeing new faces on stage and I didn’t see any room for me. I was filled with selfishness and jealousy. I see this clearly now, but at the time I just thought I didn’t like our church anymore.

I consider this one a keeper. I like the texture of it; I could have rolled it out a little thinner as the noodles puffed up quite a bit on cooking. The noodles have some “tooth” to them, a little chewy (perhaps a touch undercooked?) and have some body to them. It is definitely a recipe I’ll be making again, perhaps even today. That first batch has already been consumed.

Hungry! That’s what we were. Three years of starvation etched a deep scar in my soul, one that still hurts and burns occasionally. I try not to think of those days often, for the sake of my sanity. Those memories of hopelessness make me shudder with pain. As the assault on the city intensified, so the siege began to deliver on its promise. The city was cut off completely, surrounded by powerful artillery, snipers and land mines on the surrounding hills and mountains. The Yugoslav Army cut off all electricity which was not to be turned on for years to come. The Sarajevo valley,known for its rich supplies of fresh mountain water, was now dry. Lacking electricity, the pumping stations could not deliver water into homes, and we were left to scramble however we could to find daily sources of this life-sustaining liquid.

Before Rudy Giuliani, people believed that New York City could not be tamed. The urban decay that characterized the Big Apple from the 60′s to the 90′s was supposed to be simply accepted as the natural order of things. Further, a Republican wasn’t supposed to be able to win a city-wide election against the entrenched Democratic machine. Instead, America’s mayor won two elections, kicked a whole lot of criminal ass and made New York into a place where human beings could actually eke out a decent existence.
PLUSES - The different colors of the name bar and team slash throughout the set perk up an otherwise boring front design. Nice photography in general (although I picked a bad example to show that fact). The black box for personal info really adds to the back.
On paper, the new HBO comedy Veep appears to have been created in a laboratory specifically for me. As a political scientist, I’m a sucker for shows or movies set in the world of politics, especially those that focus on either the executive branch of the judiciary (the legislative branch generally bores me). The West Wing, Ides of March, An American President, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Bob Roberts and Parks and Recreation are all things that I was drawn to and enjoyed. As a Seinfeld devotee, I’m always happy to see one of the former cast members in something and I have a special fondness for Julia Louis-Dreyfus. I always identified with Elaine in a lot of ways, especially when Kramer referred to her as a “man’s woman. You hate other woman and they hate you.” I’ve always gotten along better with men and a lot of women don’t like me because of that. Add in a former Arrested Development cast member Tony Hale(Buster Bluth) and all the ingredients are there for me to totally fall in love with this show.
You will always get the few who can’t, or just won’t, be swayed from their favourite brew and that’s fine too.

But, on a wider reading, both parties are winners in this situation and you can expect Camra and BrewDog to claim such. Camra will say that they have neutered BrewDog by getting them to supply beer that conforms to Camra's definition of what real ale is. Camra apparatchiks will see BrewDog's compliance as confirmation of their, justifiably, rigid beer stance.

You know what she did? She baked seven tiny loaf-sized cakes and made up some homemade icing while we were at school. When we all got to my house, the whole place smelled like vanilla and cake and Christmastime. We got to decorate cakes and put on sprinkles and eat and laugh.
The works on view at the Ren stand alone as strong instances of painting. Added to this are contextual circumstances. These paintings are a challenge and almost an affront. In being unapologetically paintings, and abstract nonetheless, they offer an “umpf” of much greater magnitude than being a satisfying work of Ab-Ex-sim would. Perhaps it is an old point to make, and maybe a little inappropriate, but I’ll dust it off anyhow. And actually, it is really necessary to point out the fact that these are, on top of being abstract paintings, being made by a young woman. This adds one more twist. This work is so good is because it is being created by an artist working in what are supposedly dead tropes (large, painting, abstraction) but who is of a new generation. And on top of that, they work, they compete. These are not the paintings of old guard abstractionists thoroughly ensconced in theory, history and the academic elitism or have gone “in and out of style.” These paintings are young and alive and they declare their unashamed powerful existence to you.

It has a fairly heavy body for a beer that is this hoppy. It starts with a grapefruit ish citrus front, leading to a sappy pine flavor back bone. Then finishes with the hops, a bitter spicey dry finish. And that is where I get turned off... if they would have cut the dryness of the beer in the finish and added a little honey to the flavor profile I would love this beer.
The global dust belt has not received as much press as the global fashion weeks so you might not be familiar with this story. (Aerosols can be dust, clouds--both liquid water and ice, pollution, sea spray and volcanic ash). Occasionally, dust can be injected into the jet stream, a fast-moving river of air that circles the globe. Asian dust ends up in north America, American dust ends up in Europe, European dust ends up in Asia and so on.

Along the way, you’ll find that a lot of people talk about the “Lonely Planet” route. Because most people are using the Lonely Planet Southeast Asia book (affectionately called the “Yellow Bible”), everyone ends up going to the same places and seeing the same things. The further I traveled, the further I realized this was the case. In fact, I ran into a couple (Ian and Claire) in 6 different places over the course of about 1 month.
The implied meaning of these words isn’t exactly hard to figure out. Obama is dealing with the uncomfortable idea that not even becoming president is really enough to protect him and his family in a society that apparently isn’t as over racial differences as it would like to be. Because if Sasha or Malia were a few years older, and wearing baggy hoodies with the hoods pulled up, and they’d walked past George Zimmerman’s house…there’s no way for him to be sure that the same thing wouldn’t have happened to them. For a parent, that’s one of the scariest thoughts in the world.

There were two doors leading out of the room, each of them leading to a small 10 x 10 room empty but for some gravelly debris strewn across the floor. (Don’t stand on the gravel!) However, the challenge ahead was in the form of a gauntlet of hidden doors that took three actions to unlock. All the while, a bolt of energy would strike out at anyone who came in after the first person. This was lucky for Poppy, who could slip in, use her preternatural perception to locate the outline of the door, then get out safely, just as the little hairs on her arms stood up on end.
It was total sensory overload seeing Italy. Its beauty exceeded my expectations immediately. We drove to Pordenone, the city I would be staying in for the duration of my visit. It was about an hours drive. This was an amazing drive. The scenery Italy boasts is one of a kind and it was only enhanced by being able to stare at my very handsome boyfriend. I could not believe I was actually living this dream!

But we also have in Acts 15 the first Church Council: A dispute arose between Jewish and Gentile converts to Christianity regarding the necessity of circumcision. So, Paul and Barnabas are sent to Jerusalem to have the dispute settled. This is the first council of the Church. It is discussed with much passion. Finally, Peter stood up and proclaimed his decision that circumcision was not necessary. End of discussion.
Only later did Forest City confirm that there would be 1,240 FTE jobs, though without any documentation. And, despite Ratner's claim that compensation would "be above living wage, I'm sure," it's unlikely doubt that such part-time jobs will qualify as living-wage jobs.

And they'd all politely laughed. Later that day ...

Dave Prior and I collaborated on a Podcast:
Oppression is what the non-dominant groups of a category experience, which is essentially not having the same treatment and access to resources/privileges as the dominant group. For example: Aboriginals receive a significant amount less from welfare than non-Aboriginals. Internalized oppression is when an oppressed person begins to believe the stereotypes and awful statements about their group; for example, a Black woman begins to believe that she is not as deserving of fair treatment as White people are, or a gay man believes he is a sinner and is flawed for ‘choosing’ to be gay. Lateral violence is when, as a result of this, an oppressed person retreats to his or her group, or perhaps lashes out at the dominant group or at the very least, refuses to interact beyond his own culture; we see this when people react poorly to interracial dating, for example.

The one thing my parents failed at was integrating me into a world where I would interact with cons/felons. I was not too angry though - my dad actually taught classes at the State of CA Women’s Prison in Southern CA and talked about it, but always made it such that society had let these people down, not that they had done something wrong so how could I blame him? He wanted me to understand it was up to me to shape my community, not that people were inherently bad (except for sociopaths, which was ‘organic’ brain disease).

When I first posted an article about this tragedy, on Sunday 8 April 2012 - the same day Rapport covered the story on their front-page, I gave it the title: “The Strange Case of the Steenkamp Triple Murders.” At the time I had no idea how “strange” things were going to get, but based on the numerous confusing media reports thus far, it has certainly turned out far “stranger” than I ever imagined.

As for the opera itself, what fun! Paul's favourite for its memorable music, The Barber of Seville is a lively romp anyway, but the Vancouver Opera Asoociation ramped up the fun with a Looney-tunes inspired production. I wasn't completely convinced by the 1940s Spain film set, but Figaro as stylist rather than simply a barber made sense -- as well as making for some clever slapstick. Solid acting throughout, and most importantly, the singing satisfied, and the orchestra did as well. I'm still humming snatches of arias, hearing rhythms, smiling at remembered images.

It’s still a strong 10p performer for CBS. Despite what many speculate, I don’t see it going to Friday because it still pulls really good numbers on a weeknight. The only places for it are Tue and Sun and since I think CBS might try something new on Tue, that leaves Sun. If The Good Wife moves to Friday, The Mentalist goes to 10p Sun and a new drama gets the shot between that and TAR (or vice versa). I could also see The Mentalist 9p Sun followed by The Good Wife. I just think CBS might want to try to launch another new drama and Sun seems a good place. I could see trying Sherlock Holmes drama, Elementary, before or after The Mentalist.

He started off as a school teacher, was passionate about school reform, worked as an Education Advisor to school leaders and teachers, but ended up disillusioned by the inertia of educational culture. Seeing the Department of Education's reform agendas going nowhere, he resigned to do consultancy work, lecture at university and write a book! He also started the Australian Wellbeing Centre, a place that provides a variety of services and resources to support the health and awakening of body, mind and soul. He and his wife, Pamela, a clinical psychologist, are also enjoying establishing a nature stay and workshop venue, and a centre for enjoying and engaging with horses to our mutual benefit.
This one has a mixed review on Grubbstreet. I, who care little for modern art, got it and felt it was wonderful and made me actually care about modern art, or at least Rothko's embodiment of it. I don't have answers to many of the questions raised, but I have to admit they are wonderful questions. The Lovely Bride, who also doesn't care for modern art, didn't care for it as much, and further commented "Of course the painting seems to vibrate if you start drinking at 9:30 in the morning!"

I graduated from high school in 1974. The state road people were working on a huge section of Interstate 79 that would alleviate my need for boring adjectives. I could not wait until they were finished with it. It took me about 2 1/2 hours to get home. The new interstate section would knock off at least thirty minutes of tiresome driving time. Please hurry state road people.

I don’t want to go into this in too much detail, but this is the calendar that measures the period coming to an end December 21st 2012. It groups days by factors of 20 into larger measures of time. 20 days is a winal. 18 winal are a tun (360 days). And everything else is a factor of 20. 20 tun = 1 katun. 20 katun = 1 baktun, and so on.

Let’s just say I’m gay, for the sake of argument, and I die tomorrow.

In all these healings, we see that the motivation for healing, came from compassion, from the love of God in Christ. Compassion notices human needs. Compassion reaches out to meet the needs of others. That’s what Jesus did. That’s what happens in healing services as people motivated by compassion for others in need, reach out to pray for them. We turn now to the second ground for healing. ie.,

This was a weird combo, but experimenting is fun! I took 3 lipsticks and just smushed them on my gob to see what the result would be. First I applied a layer of MAC Up The Amp, a pinky purple. Then I applied the tiniest bit of Rimmel Kate 04, a blackened purple. Finally I applied a liberal amount of MAC Summer Shower, which looks like a minty aqua colour in the tube but just shows up as a layer of pink and blue shimmer. I think I just used a bit of bronzer on the cheeks because I didn't know what the hell to wear with that lip combo XD

Battery Manufacturers were really caught off guard with how fast and large the demand would be for high capacity batteries. One of the biggest things I look for in a phone when shopping around is if the battery can be removed or not. Many devices do not allow for battery removal without taking apart the device. This in my opinion is just asking for trouble. Many phone glitches and problems that occur can be resolved by a simple battery pull, the ability to purchase and install a larger capacity battery to meet the demands of your personal usage without constantly hunting for a power source to charge it.

It’s your basic, all-purpose garment. Never be without it.” Colossians 3:12-14 MSG

STEVEN: I was always interested in aikido. As a teen I did both Judo and Karate, but I wanted a martial art that I could practice for the rest of my life. One of the great things about aikido is a technique doesn't have to do lasting harm (or you can kill someone with it). It's the Martial art you can use on a inebriated relative at the family reunion without getting kicked out of the family. This choice, not to inflict harm, is an advantage as I don't have to hesitate to respond to an attack. Worrying about the harm I might do =would= cause me to hesitate.

Consider this simple experiment. Many of you have had children and all of you were, in time past, children. At what stage do you have to teach your child to disobey? When do you teach them to lie; to cheat; to steal, or fight? It comes naturally, does it not? Rather you have to teach them to obey, to tell the truth, and to be honest with one another.

I spent last Monday morning strolling around a fascinating museum dedicated to the history of the Inniskilling regiment of the British Army. The museum is situated in Enniskillen Castle on Lough Erne right in the heart of the Co. Fermanagh town. In the courtyard close to the ancient Watergate there are captured German artilery pieces from World War One of which one was later converted for use in the next war as part of coastal defences against the threatened Nazi invasion of southern England in the summer of 1940. Inside the museum itself you are taken on a journey through the locally recruited regiment’s history from the wars against Napolean through to World War Two, Korea and the Cold War frontline of West Berlin.

For a few hours, he could forget about Tori. Barbara made the family a wonderful spaghetti dinner, and the boys competed with each other to tell their dad what had happened at school that day, especially in gym. They loved to brag about their exploits in soccer and how good they were. Then there were dishes to load in the dishwasher, and homework to supervise. And finally he made sure they got washed and put their jammies on.
Let me give you a great example of such a moment I had yesterday. Benjie (my boyfriend) and I went to hospital so that he could see a patient before we headed home for the day. Regular occurrence in our household. It was raining cats and dogs so we parked at the entrance of the hospital so that he could run in without being soaked. Not so normal parking but normal enough nonetheless. Upon arriving, Benjie got out of the car and I, as usual, got out my phone to check Facebook and email, etc. while I waited. Just as I turned my phone on, a gentleman (or who I thought was a gentleman) opened my car door. My first thought was that he wanted to help me out of the car, assuming I was a patient. I politely said no thank you and before I could process another thought the gentleman quickly became a mad man! He started screaming “I’M GOING TO KILL YOU!” and was forcefully pulling my door open as I was squealing and fighting against him in the car. He was visibly beaten and his hand was bleeding down my wet, rainy car window as I played tug of war with my door to get it closed and to most importantly, keep him out! He began bashing his elbow against my window as his screaming intensified even more.
I will begin this by saying that I enjoy dressing up and looking nice. In fact, I think it would be nice if people took a little bit of extra time to look nice, instead of "cool". Sure, I wear blue jeans and t-shirts as much as the next person, but I still appreciate the early part of the last century where everyone - literally everyone - dressed up at all times. Men wore suits in every situation and women wore dresses.

It would be like American Idol only more fun. And less singing. Because to be honest (and I’m probably about to piss off a few people) I can’t stand American Idol and about 95% of “reality” TV. I don’t like it. It’s stupid. Why can’t people be discovered the old fashioned way like at gas stations or karaoke bars?

You can tell a lot about someone by the items with which they surround themselves: a record collection, a DVD library, their wardrobe. I judge people by these things, and judge them harshly. Should I see a Hinder CD, a Uwe Boll movie or a trucker hat in anyone's residence, that person shall hear my very strong and very correct opinions.
When I am on the receiving end of a call, the scenario isn’t much different. I try to think it is a missed call, but when the caller doesn’t disconnect the call after one ring and I am forced to take the call, I look around with expectant eyes for any savior who would volunteer to answer the phone instead of me as if it’s a bomb ticking to explode and not a phone waiting to be answered.
It didn't really seem to matter how I answered their question anyway. Often, what ever I said was met with discouragement. After a while, it just seemed to me my best bet was to lie. Teacher, that was always a good and noble answer, hard to argue with, grounded, attainable. Even saying I don't know got me a better response than anything close to the truth.

Wednesday morning I couldn't ignore the absolutely stellar mid-winter weather window and bolted for the high country.

Each of these three has their own, intensely personal response to the death, for whilst it is just the one man who has died he was many different kinds of man to the people that he knew.

I was a 21-year-old university student then, happily backpacking through Europe (on a quest, as one Danish friend put it, to “see the most train”) en route to Moscow for a semester of study abroad. We’d stopped in Venice to stay with friends in a magnificent old apartment. A quick call home found worry in my mom’s voice and an exhortation to switch on CNN.

I also really loved the two main characters in this book-- Amy and Elder-- and how the story is told chapter by chapter through their alternating points of view. It was easy to tell which POV I was reading from because they both had totally unique perspectives. I also loved that both of them could think for themselves-- Amy was a spirited, emotional character who refuses to believe that life on Godspeed is natural, and Elder is constantly challenging Eldest and his methods for controlling the ship. Both Amy and Elder were very well-developed, since they both had distinct personalities, memories, and histories. This made it easy to slip into each character's identity and get lost in their story.

SAMPLE ANSWER: Jay Richards. Jay Richards is one of the most well-rounded Christian scholars operating today. He has knowledge of multiple areas, including economics and science. To make a Jay Richards, you need to be very careful about his education – which could mean homeschooling and saving money for later university tuition, as well as exposing him to apologetics and debates at an earlier age. He would need to have the dedicated attention of his mother for the first two years of his life, at least. Some laws that would help would be lower taxes, school choice, and academic freedom laws.

The mob spawns are creative and various - goblins, orcs, wolves, wargs, spiders, bandits, demons, yetis just to name a few. Just about all have something special or unique - high armor, fast speed, etc. Some have special powers that augment other mobs, some heal other mobs and some have really interesting abilities that have surprising in-game effects (hint-hint). There are creative spawn locations on certain maps and short-cuts that mobs will sometimes use to their advantage. The pathing is interesting and if you don't have troops in just the right place, they are doomed against certain mobs or the mobs will bypass them - not sure if that's a programming flaw or working as intended.

France is a society that believes their manners are culturally important and, in fact, chic, but (generalization) most French men are not "gentlemen" in the way we think of that term. In the South, we call that good home training. And my point of view is that we need good manners to make our lives a little nicer and to actually work more smoothly. But how wonderful is it that French men have actually been trained to be a little more sensitive in terms of the art of life.

Everything becomes a blur when you’re to sober to see the signs sometimes? The road was boring and my mind just took it upon itself to jazz things up a little, add some spice! Fill in all the unfinished colours and add life to the ugly canvas around me! The road was boring, no colours or shapes to catch my gaze. It was just an ordinary road, nothing special on an ordinary day. I’m not in space, not mad, not surrounded by stars or by silence; I’m just in a big city. Seeing and hearing what I want to make the journey towards absolution easier.

I chatted a bit with Peter about writing and agents--and how great they are for brainstorming and vetting your work (I couldn't agree more--shout out to Agent Vickie!). We also talked about how kids shouldn't ever stop creating, cause when they do, it's sometimes hard to get it back as an adult. He made the girls promise to "always make a mark" -- which is a wonderful philosophy for kids, as well as adults.

The most shocking thing that I have found that some Americans confuse the “5 de Mayo” holiday for “Mexican Independence Day” or even worse “Mexican New Year.” I am lucky to have dual citizenship. This means I am both American and Mexican. So I try to keep up with history on both sides of the border. I love to make joking bets with friends while they sip on their Coronas and truly believe that we are celebrating “Mexican Independence Day.”
Secrets of the Clown (C, 2007) Bobby's having some problems with his girlfriend Val, so one of his dopey friends vindictively breaks her prized clown doll. This friend is promptly knifed to death on the doorstep. Soon afterward another friend of Bobby's gets murdered in his car in the cemetery. Bobby and his friends vow to track down the killer, but Val has dreams of them all being killed. They contact spirits with ouija tactics and call in a psychic/exorcist guy. Meanwhile, Val turns out to have witchcraft powers and battles demons on the highway while Bobby and his friends deal with possessed friends and a clown monster (he looks like one of the type of wrestlers that WCW was bringing in right before it went under) shows up. A big supernatural battle starts up. The moviemakers had ideas beyond their budget or skill, and the end results aren't good, but you can't fault them for trying, and I've seen worse home-made horror. I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but it does seem sincere enough to make you want to help it along.
Many years ago, I might have thought I was crafty. I would create cross stitch samplers and mop head dolls. I wove things with paper ribbon. The glue gun was my friend. But, now I look back and see that most of it was junk. Why did I think I needed that stuff or that anyone would want it? These days, I am certainly not a Candlestick Maker. I will purchase my household items, and they will be better quality and not nearly as tacky. I hope.

What I think maybe confused people and put them off the scent of any murderer was the side plot of the "Unicorn" being present (and subsequently caught) - which is the one slight issue I had with the plot... I thought the Unicorn bit was unnecessary and got in the way a little. But that in itself is a device Christie used - everyone in the mystery with something to hide will always give some sub-plots which will distract from the main story and throw the reader/viewer off the scent. Possibly.
- According to the new policy, all class discussions must be directly related to the teacher's own subject area and curriculum. Often when something important is happening in the world, I'll throw out the day's lesson plans and devote an entire class session to a discussion about the event. The day after the September 11 attacks, for example, every one of my classes was spent talking about what happened, and answering questions and discussing what was on their minds. Similarly, the recent earthquake in Japan triggered some intense discussions about natural disasters and the world's response to them. Or sometimes it's a more local event, like things happening in the school that directly effect the kids. I think it's important for them to have a place where they can talk about this stuff with guidance from an adult, and I believe my classroom should be such a place. Some days I don't teach physics - sometimes there are other things that are more important. But apparently, I'm not allowed to do that anymore. I'm only allowed to teach physics, and the kids are on their own when it comes to figuring out the stuff that really matters.

However, the novel leaves us with hope. She is does not divorce Osmond, but she does leave against his wishes to attend to some family business. She returns to him even after Mr. Goodwood has again sought her out and promised to save her from the wicked husband. She does no such thing. She returns home to face the consequences of her actions, yet as the narrative leaves off, we are left with the hope that she will work things out and eventually find happiness in love. Whether or not that is with Mr. Goodwood is unclear, but we do know that she must return home to help her step-daughter Pansy, who is trying to marry the man she loves against her father’s wishes. Isabel’s actions are noble. She is a true lady in this regard, for she puts aside her own feelings of unhappiness and entrapment to protect and defend her beautiful, innocent, and helpless step-daughter.

But the lowest unemployment rate for February on record signalled the relief in inflation may be short-lived, as services costs may rise even faster than overall inflation as the economy reacts later this year to the heavy stimulus.

That I had not been too successful at ever making it happen only made me want to try again.

Going further, we’ll establish a Minimum Income (“M.I.”), also a variable linked to indicators. This will be the minimum amount of money a person/household needs to survive. Can’t find a full-time job? No problem! The government will cover the gap between your wages and the M.I. Oh, we’ll also be assigning you to a job, maybe something you’re skilled at, but also maybe sweeping streets or in the kitchen of a retirement home. We’ll also train you for some steady job. Once the M.I. program is in place, we can terminate the various welfare and workfare programs that are so costly and utterly worthless.

At the beginning of this cheeser, a young child is interrupted by his overbearing mother while assembling this puzzle (or, in the Latin, Puzzelus Interuptus), sending him off on a murderous rampage in later years. A replica of this puzzle couldn't be too hard to create, and would make a great gift for the horror fan that has everything. But I'm torn. Should the missing pieces be included, or left out to stay true to the source?

Leaving the pier Mark, Brendan and I headed to the inner marina to try again for the Slavonian Grebe but, no sooner had we arrived Brendan received a call that a White-tailed Eagle was just down the road seen flying from Hawkinge towards Folkestone. Despite arriving minutes later we never did see it although we did manage to note 7 Common Buzzards, 1 Sparrowhawk and a couple of Kestrels. Once again stopping at the harbour as we were homeward bound, a quick search revealed no Slav Grebes while a walk along the Prince of Wales Pier added nothing new for the day but we did relocate the Kumlien’s Gull sleeping on the apron of the old Hoverpad.

This organization works for the economic and social improvement of the people of Haiti, and currently has a program to bring solar ovens to Haitian women.

The solar oven promotes the use of environmentally friendly--and free--energy." At the market, we'll roast market veggies and meat in the oven to give out (for free!) to shoppers, and a representative from this organization will be available to answer questions.

Occupations for a given individual can change over time, or they may be seasonal. A man who worked in London as a pawnbroker’s assistant, later became a commercial clerk, a general salesman and a shopkeeper. It was typical of a Victorian husband and father to turn his hand to a series of different jobs to earn enough to support his family. To most of our ancestors, an occupation was something they learned in their early years and practiced until they dropped. Not for them the luxury of pursuing the path of ambition which was afforded to those in the law, the church or the military. You hewed stone or drew water because that was what was needed to keep the wolf from the door; indeed, you probably did both, since dual or multiple occupations have often been the norm in British society, as is evidenced by many a 17th century “shoemaker and alehouse keeper” or a 19th century “collier and grocer”.

A problem we encountered early in the development and deployment of the program was the lack of reliable electricity in those rural villages to charge the smartphones. When we launched the CKW program two years ago, we gave car batteries to the CKWs as a means of charging their phones – but this worked out about as well as you might imagine. We then found a partner in a San Francisco based startup called Fenix, which was designing and building solar-charging solutions for use by the rural poor. We’ve developed an excellent relationship with the Fenix team over the last year, and we are deploying the Fenix ReadySet solar-charging solution to all of our CKWs.

I used a heat gun (from a distance) to slowly dry it and it crackled! This is a technique that I don't have much luck with!!! Once dry, a layer of Glue & Seal Matte, then the CI image & sentiment were stamped onto tissue then laid onto the wet glue, and brushed over with more Glue and Seal. A couple of further coats of G & S , then I coloured the image with neat distress reinkers, added a cog with attached word tiles and a zipper pull coloured with a bit of alcohol ink (to make it look a bit rusty). I went around the edge of the block with a little frayed burlap, then a little metallic rub on. My aim was to make it look as aged and old as possible!

Unlike other tribute episodes (especially “The Power of Madonna” or “Brittany/Britney”), there was an actual storyline in this episode that really continued to push so many of these characters down to their final moments as high schoolers on the show. Everyone in the cast is going in so many different directions. I have no idea how we’re going to bring them all back together on one show next season unless it’s like Game of Thrones and certain people just aren’t featured every episode. I haven’t made it much of a secret that Kurt’s my favorite character on the show, and I was surprised by just how much I was beginning to dislike him for the way he was treating Blaine by texting that other boy. However, it was all saved by a very touching scene with Mike O’Malley (who probably doesn’t have many appearances left as Burt Hummel) which totally made me cry. They have one of my favorite father/son relationships in the history of television. Also, the scene where Kurt and Blaine went to the counseling together also had me in tears. They’re such a great couple and I know their relationship isn’t going to survive Kurt leaving so I have to appreciate these last couple episodes they have together. My only complaint is that Darren Criss’ acting in those moments were absurdly wooden. He’s a great singer and dancer but he is not one of the better actors in the cast.

All well and good -- to a point. Yes, the high-volume online and batch programs with stringent performance requirements were insulated from the more dynamic BI application workload, but the analytics users were not protected from system outages as were the other users of the DB2 data sharing system. Here's what I mean by that statement: suppose that DBS1 (a made-up name) were the subsystem to which users of the BI application were required to connect. If that subsystem were to be unavailable for some reason, the BI users would get connection failures and might be out of luck for a while. In contrast to that situation, the operational application users (whether connecting locally via the DB2 group attach name, or remotely over the network using the group's location name) were assured of successful connections as long as any of the member DB2 subsystems were available (thanks, in the network-attached case, to the use of dynamic virtual IP addressing, which I briefly described in a blog entry from my independent DB2 consulting days, and about which you can read more in the IBM "red book" titled "DB2 9 for z/OS: Distributed Functions" -- most all of which is applicable to DB2 10, as well).
Oddly, some of the best shots I got were on one of the most recent trips, to the oppidum of Ensérune, which not only resulted in the blog post that was possibly the most fun to write of all of them this year, but some really nice photos. Part of it was because besides its hilltop location, it was near a weird 13th century engineering project which looks like a UFO landing-site. In the annals of almost-great photos, this circle of light hit the circle in the valley moments before the shutter clicked, but the wind had driven it on by the time the picture got taken. Still a pretty nice shot.

So I decided to give the Boba a try, and I'm really glad I did! It's really comfortable for me and my toddler, and super convenient. Now that my toddler is two, most of the time she'd rather walk. But for those times she falls asleep in her carseat on the way to the store, it's nice to have something I can quickly pull out and put on so she can stay asleep while I shop! It's also nice to be able to wear her on my back when she's awake, because she never wants to sit in the shopping cart!!
Sure, the 1995 BBC version outstripped this one. Early BBC costume dramas look prehistoric now, with their immovable cameras and bad lighting. I did a lot of group viewing of the 1995 Pride and Prejudice too — including one memorable weekend with all my best grad school girlfriends, piled together in a friend’s apartment, loading up on Colin Firth like too many candy bars. (Aldine, I haven’t forgotten that, nor the fact that you’re the one who introduced me to North & South.)
As daughters of our Heavenly Father, and as daughters of Eve, we are all mothers and we have always been mothers. And we each have the responsibility to love and help lead the rising generation. How will our young women learn to live as women of God unless they see what women of God look like, meaning what we wear, watch, and read; how we fill our time and our minds; how we face temptation and uncertainty; where we find true joy; and why modesty and femininity are hallmarks of righteous women? How will our young men learn to value women of God if we don’t show them the virtue of our virtues?
The reason for bringing this to your attention is simply that.....I'm puzzled! Is it that:
This clip shows the Ferrari crest the hill before braking into a turn (4s into the clip). As the car crests the hill at high speed with DRS open, it’s clear that the wing is bowed from the aero load. It’s possible to see the side spans of the wing bend down from the central section. At this point there is some vibration in the wing, but not an excessive amount. As the car starts to go down hill (DRS still open) and passes a shadow across the track, the wing starts a rocking motion (5s into the clip). This rocking soon increases in violence until Massa closes the DRS and starts to brake as usual for the corner (at 9s), so this episode only lasts three seconds. I counted around 20 movements of each endplate, which increase to the point where the endplates’ skid blocks strike the ground.
But this is the craziest list I've found yet to date...
There were medals for all. Students from Arlington Science Focus School in Virginia were awarded gold medal on long ribbons while the Olympic music heard during every broadcast of the games, played.
On the other hand, instead of the Austin Symphony, we got an appalling performance of The Star Spangled Banner by a 16-year-old American Idol wannabe who changed the key of the song any old time she felt like it. And who added more grace notes to the song than it ever needed. (Query: is the American anthem improved by someone performing mediocre vocal gymnastics at the end of each line? I think not.) And, instead of the Austin Symphony, we got piped-in pre-recorded music that someone not well-versed in traditional music determined to be "patriotic"--including, regrettably, that Toby Keith "boot in your ass" song.

Wishing everyone a wonderful week!
So now that it is all out in the open I've been trying to tell him if you want to go ahead. You don't need my permission and I don't need to be in trouble. And then I clarified that it can be a little lighter ya know. A good girl spanking and I think he's getting it.

He reminded me of these words in Luke 19:40:
And the wildlife was incredible. The Abaco Bank and Bahamian Trench still held one of the earth’s most stable populations of dolphin, barracuda and basking shark. Shark city was where she was headed, if only for one night.
Its only when 80% of your work is routine, that you must perhaps pro-actively give it serious thought of how to initiate a big change in your job or your perception of the current job. Time to strongly believe in possibilities which will make you feel truly alive and kicking in your life. Its your right to claim that back from life, from yourself.
It is.
I've always been interested in human interaction and this was intensified last year when I joined Facebook. Until then I was one of those refuseniks who saw Mark Zuckerberg's creation as an attempt to shorten out attention span even more (as if that was humanly possible) through a combination of LOLs, smileys, emoticons and snaps taken by a shaky hand on a mobile phone. However, I was able to re-connect with old classmates from my uni years and form an online community in which we do a lot of reminiscing. At the centre of this virtual reunion are patterns that are embedded in our genes. It's the reason why one of the members of this online group posted a photo of his wedding the other day and despite the fact that I didn't know him that well, I had a lump in my throat nonetheless. It was the black-and-white-yellow-around-the-edges colour of the photo that did it for me.
The rarest of all the athasian drakes. Water drakes are amphibious and prefer to live (and fight if need be) in water. They're fiercely protective of any body of water large enough for them to live in and will ferociously any intruders.
Preheat oven @ 175C and grease a loaf or round pan.
I knew also that Pepe was educated in Havana, but this recording was the first time I actually saw him play drums. We recorded this song in a single take with piano, drums, and bass, and later the melodion was added. I think that the feature I like the best about this recording is how intuitive the communication between the musicians has become.
Now, I think that the Internet is a great opportunity for smaller, specialized, retail shops. I mean, there are zillions of releases out each and every day and everything’s available over the Web (I mean, on physical support) and a bunch of people start to notice most of the “large” medias are just about telling bullshit, being paid to have interviews and good reviews and stuff like that (not all of them, thankfully!)… It’s a great opportunity for passionate people to open small stores and “sell” the “service” of being of good advice, helping people discovering new stuff, having physical meetings with the artists when they are in town, partnering with the local promoters for before or after-parties when there are gigs, having exclusive little gigs in, and many many many other events around the music and the releases. Add to this a good sense of business and the ability to deal limited editions with labels and you’ve got a winning business, for sure.
I really liked the colours I used, but it is nice to be able to colour your own, I hope you enjoy using this freebie... take care all...

Thank you all so much for you fabulous entries over the last 2 weeks we have all loved going through them.
The painting is almost finished. One of the downsides of my painting process is the wait while layers dry. However, it’s also a positive because it gives me time to experiment with the mixed media pieces I’ve been playing with.

"Friend or Enemy?" is an unexpected foray into 80's pop/rock reminiscent of The Tubes, and its a lot of fun. "Lost in the Bag" is a quirky number, with an engaging lyric to help it along. "Apropos of Nothing" sees China Syndrome in its best 10cc songwriting form along the lines of a song like "Dreadlock Holiday." Its oddly engaging.
I allude to the latter two for the purpose to show you that not all mountains are solid rock and covered in glaciers. Most mountains in the world are eroded and covered in rich forests. Imagine the Rockies now and try to traverse through the valleys. It’d be difficult on foot, right? Now imagine them in a few million years after the peaks have crumbled. Where might those peaks go but down? After so long those rocks which sat so high above the world now dwell among the shadows broken and shattered. Again, look at the Appalachians with their blunt peaks and rampant forests. Where might the dirt have come from for those trees to grow if not from the very rocks and minerals crumbling?
I find Technorati pretty frustrating to use on a daily basis simply because the site can be excruciatingly slow. You can get around this by subscribing to search terms and tags.
This girl who is leaving is the one with two jobs – the other has a part-time job through a temp agency and is receiving payments from her baby daddy, and may possibly be on other assistance. We wouldn’t accept her individually, so we certainly won’t be changing the lease to only list her since we know it will probably lead to an eviction.
Although, it’s probably not the healthiest dinner, with all the barbecue and whatnot, it’s still better than take out, or the microwave alternative.
Moving on, why don’t couples have sex?

This explanation clears up rather parsimoniously some of what would be difficulties for a simple temporal priority account of cause and effect. Take the example of a water pump. The cause of the water rising (effect) is the upward motion of the piston in the cylinder. But surely both of these, in fact, go on at once. Do we have here an instance of cause and effect being concurrent? The very fact that we can ask such a question shows some weakness in a simple temporal priority account of cause. If, however, a cause is seen as simply a convenient category within one event, there is, of course, no difficulty.
Always in my grocery cart: oats, sweet potatoes, potatoes, brown rice. Why these in particular? Why no high-fiber bread? No high-fiber cereal? NO KASHI?!?!! (They are “seven whole grains on a mission!” – yes, to make you fat.)

"You might think that," he said, "But that's what's so great about grapes. They thrive on adversity, on the water rolling down the hill in a hard storm, on the wind whipping through. Think of the vineyards back in France. Can you think of a single one that's on flat land?"

I'm making a few little gifts for my husband, David, for his birthday which is in two weeks. I'm planning a study/laboratory in the attic of the WAMH, which will be full of scientific instruments and so forth circa 1700.
Kit turned 11 last Friday. I didn't mark the occassion on the blog before because he didn't celebrate here so all was quiet. However, he had a great time with his mom, grampa and brothers down on Cape Cod, got some nifty gifts and it rounded out his vacation nicely. However, his mom gave him a cell phone that she knew he couldn't keep.
Other days—many days—these conversations are simply brilliant unschooling gems. Last Friday was one of those days. In the space of about an hour, Emma and I talked about green smoothies (I was making one), multiplying 9s and all the cool patterns you end up with, the formation of the Traveling Wilburys (I started singing "Handle Me With Care" after spilling something), how the Beatles and the Stones fit into rock culture, Dr. Hook and "Cover of the Rolling Stone," and then—because of this cool story from Wikipedia:
Meanwhile, there is a fringe group in St. Petersburg that is not only condoning the horrific actions of the last month, but encouraging them. They are preaching - yes, preaching, as they say they are religious - what they call "justice" and they are encouraging open season on police officers. I am all about freedom of speech, which I practice here and am practicing right now in this post. But if they incite more violence against law enforcement officers they should be held accountable. That's all I'm saying.

The next thing to do was fix the router to the plywood, this was easy enough, as it was just a case of bolting the two bits together, I did take the router apart to make it easier to fix things together.
The truth is, my life is not that interesting. Shocking, I know. But the other truth is that I am afraid. I'm afraid to divulge too much information on my blog about myself and my family. It's scary.
Let’s see…the pace was great. The structure was great. The writing was top-notch. Am I leaving anything out? I mean, when I read a script, I’m charting about 8 things that show a mastery of the craft. They include things like character, structure, dialogue, pacing, conflict, theme, that sort of stuff. Most amateur scripts I read are lucky to have 1. This may be the first script I’ve read to have all 8.
It is not known if ’1pondo’ is a Singapore PR and new citizen. With the continued influx of large number of PRC immigrants into Singapore, such everyday conflicts are likely to rise in the future.

No walk is complete without a cup of something and at the south end of the portion of the Greenway that crosses the Olympic Park, there is this cafe and viewing point called ViewTube.
Having some trouble with Avon today, they changed my district which was fine and changed my delivery day to Saturday which was okay. But guess what, my order didn't come on Saturday, instead they shipped it UPS and it arrived late this evening. That is going to make it harder for me to get the orders to my customers. I left a message with my new district manager so we'll see how good she is to work with and what options she comes up with for me. I'm surely not making enough money off this to put up with any aggravation !!
Feels good,
Perhaps your organization has its own legends, a senior leader who started her career as a secretary or a project manager who launched a product that changed your industry. As a new manager, this is an ideal time for you to reach out to those people and learn from them directly.
I did not like that I was in a rush and had to ignore my sudden craving for a piece of pie and a cup of coffee.
Here are the complete lyrics in a video format with this beautiful song playing for you:

On our way back to school, I would cover my nose with my right palm and smell it, so that I could get the 'Theeyal' smell, till it lasted! Now you know why I didn't wash my hands with soap :-)

The California Grill is not a value option by any stretch when it comes to dining at Walt Disney World, where starters can range from $10-$20 and main courses can be anywhere from $25-$50. Add in a glass of wine or two and dessert (or two) and this can certainly add up. However, the quality and variety of food, the service and Disney magic, not to mention the prime viewing of Magic Kingdom’s fireworks make this a dining experience that you won’t soon forget and will continue to return to upon future visits. If you happen to be dining with the Disney Dining Plan, the California Grill is considered a ‘Signature’ dining option, and thus requires 2 table service credits.

And if there is indeed a connection, I'll be looking up ways to counteract the blues. Maybe there's a supplement I can take the couple weeks leading up my period, maybe I need to spend as much time outdoors that week, I don't know. Does any of this sound familiar to anyone else? If so, what do you do to handle it?
Easier typed than said.
The intensity of Barry’s violence is one of many ways in which Punch-Drunk Love works beyond its quirky little storyline and operates through a more complicated set of affective registers. At the film’s center, Barry is a likeable, but distant, character, whose anger and social awkwardness keeps audiences at arm’s length, and who inhabits a depressingly barren, colorless urban landscape. The plot goes in seemingly random directions, culminating in an awkward love affair involving a man with serious anger problems and a woman who may well be a stalker, and whose courtship largely involves busted up restrooms, moments of miscommunication, doses of self-loathing, and pillow talk that centers on affectionate descriptions of human mutilation.

He picked up from a low table a simple light bulb and thrust it aloft, and in his naked grasp the bulb, dead one second before, came to life, bathing him in orange light. Moans of adoration dwelled about him.
