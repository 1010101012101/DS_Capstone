Almost any summer fruit works in pie: berries, stone fruit - I've even seen recipes for grape pie - so long as the fruit has had a chance to ripen.

øA: I was always intrigued when I was growing up, and then in engineering school, with the idea of a perpetual machine. I think of the Wal-Mart culture as that. It's kind of self-creating. Our day-to-day process of managing the company and the basic beliefs, the basic foundation of integrity in the company, the way that we train and develop people ends up perpetuating the culture of the company. Sam Walton, if he could come back today, would be very, very proud of the culture that he created and still exists at Wal-Mart.

What we know is that Oden is a large person with large levers. And that he reported for this season lighter, leaner and more mobile. Also, that he looked terrific this season, particularly in the seven games prior to the patella blowing up.

I’m not sure why that is and the reasons are probably many. Maybe it’s our TV-ESPN-sound bite mentality, where life’s problems and challenges and struggles get wrapped up in a 30-minute time slot with a few commercials thrown in. Maybe it’s a society that has evolved such a massive safety net through countless programs, that there’s little risk in not finishing. Maybe it’s the fear of failure.

Playa del Carmen: I'm betting more chocolate is consumed by the Riviera Maya's luxury spas — start with an exfoliating cacao-bean-almond-oil scrub and follow up with a chocolate cream wrap — than in cafes. For internal consumption, Ah Cacao is the place. The company has two cafes in Playa, one in Cancún's La Isla shopping center, and outlets all over the coast. Ah Cacao's pure, handmade Criollo chocolate is grown on the border of Tabasco and Chiapas. It comes in bars (more than 70 percent cacao, compared with less then 15 percent in most commercial brands), unsweetened cocoa or roasted beans, not to mention body bars and moisturizers. And then there are the cafe's brownies, mochas, frappes and chocolate shots. The Web site has recipes for traditional Mexican hot chocolate.

Silver Lake, a series of hills surrounding a scenic pair of reservoirs five miles northwest of downtown L.A., is where many of America's leading Modernist architects first made their marks from the 1930s to the '60s, working on sloping lots because they were cheaper. Walt Disney built his first studio and made "Snow White" at 2725 Hyperion Ave. (now occupied by a Gelson's supermarket). And in 1969, Charles Manson and followers drove here and killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca in their home on Waverly Drive. For more on Disney and Manson, and much more on the architectural legacy of Richard Neutra, Rudolf Schindler and others, sign on for a two-to-three-hour tour from Laura Massino Smith, founder of Architecture Tours L.A. After a cup at LAMILL Coffee Boutique (1636 Silver Lake Blvd.) and a stroll along the east or west reservoir footpaths, you meet Massino Smith, who wheels you through the hills in her minivan, spinning the stories behind the dozens of homes whose open floor plans, big windows and spare geometry were revolutionary in their time. In the 2300 block of Silver Lake Boulevard, you go pedestrian to explore a colony of Neutra buildings (including his former home, which is open for tours 11 a.m.-3 p.m. most Saturdays). Atop Micheltorena Street, you glimpse the craziest tennis court ever, cantilevered from a hilltop as part of the Silvertop estate designed by John Lautner.

After Sept. 11, President George W. Bush and countless politicians and commentators told us, "Islam is a religion of peace." One of the subtexts of this assertion was that "Muslims are just like us. Their religion, like ours, preaches peace." In other words, the narrative we developed to combat prejudice against Muslims asserted that Muslim-Americans were just like other Americans. And where it counts, this is true: Muslim Americans, like other Americans, support democracy, individual rights and the rule of law.

Both of those cultural forces contribute to the Baohaus ethos. Huang was so determined to find employees who shared his taste in music that he placed "help wanted" ads on Craigslist that hinged on cryptic snippets of lyrics. If you didn't know that "play Nintendo with Cease-a-Leo" was a nod to a Notorious BIG song, you might not fit in.
Smyly appeared ready to strand him when he got ahead of Alex Gordon, 0-2. But on the next pitch, he threw Gordon what he called a terrible pitch, the only one all night he regretted. Gordon lined a single to center to score Escobar and make it 1-1.

This is the world that wineries from Oregon and Washington joined in May when they signed an agreement with Hong Kong to trade -- and promote -- wines from the region. It was helped by Hong Kong's desire to increase its profile in not just wine, but the art world and other luxury goods.
Even before I arrived, I found hotel websites that warned readers that some cab drivers would "take you for a ride," so they offered to meet you at the airport and take you to the hotel for about $45 to $60. A cab ride should cost about $30 from the airport to Sultanahmet.

People say New Yorkers are cranky. Always in a hurry. Impatient.
The letter, signed by first recall leader Jasun Wurster, asks people to vote for Mary Volm in the city council race to unseat Dan Saltzman. Apparently, he sent it without permission from the official recall folks.

"Absent strong parental support, a pregnant teen is likely to drop out of high school in order to care for her baby," said Wachtel, whose United Way agency offers an array of age-appropriate pregnancy-prevention programs.
The menu changes at least weekly, or more often if the chef feels inspired. The kitchen also provides a few extras along the way: warm house-made flatbread and, before the first course, a small amuse such as a thick broccoli soup or a sardine on a pad of farro. After the main course, Freitas sends out a shot glass of Meyer lemon soda; after dessert, he serves small cookies. All this makes the restaurant seem generous and the customers feel special.
Mayor Jamie Barberio thinks so, arguing if the township doesn’t use open-space money, taxes will be raised by the school board to pay for the project, which nearly everyone agrees is necessary. The project would include two new fields, lights and maintenance costs at Parsippany and Parsippany Hills high schools.
Melvin said Crisp went through a battery of tests during that period to rule out more serious conditions.
My friends, they treat me. They do. I just started in the morning going and having breakfast with a friend. That's something for me. My mom is here visiting and she allows me to go and lie down. That's me time. Or take a bath. You know, lock the door.

Though the Army's membership isn't tallied -- "If you want to be TA you are TA," Dittfurth said -- thousands of fans sit in the Army's area at the north end zone of PGE Park. And while the Seattle Sounders collected praise for their "Scarf Seattle" campaign in advance of their jump to MLS this year, the Army has been bedecking necks for years. It has sold 6,000 scarves, Dittfurth said.
Emily, 15, is a member of Westmont High School's agricultural science program, a series of classes that focuses on farming and agriculture. Every day after school, the Westmont freshman walks across the street from the school campus to the farm and tends to the five animals she is responsible for. That ranges from feeding and washing the animals, to letting them out for exercise, and tasks such as collecting the chickens' eggs when they hatch. Emily usually sells the eggs to neighbors and friends.
Investigators found Newark residents Terrance Carter, 24, and Shahiem Edwards, 32, as well as 33-year-old Orange resident Halimah Jacobs, inside. Detectives quickly recovered 140 bags of cocaine, 10 decks of heroin and more than a dozen hollow point bullets.

British booksellers and publishers were initially wary, concerned that giving books away would lessen their value at a time when sales were already slumping. But the reverse proved true, with sales getting a nice bump, especially for the World Book Night titles. ("Toast" saw a spike of more than 350 percent over the next year. )

While other councilmembers have expressed concern in the wake of a Mercury News investigation into the issue, Liccardo is the first to push for a wholesale reevaluation of a policy that has led San Jose to log more arrests for public drunkenness than any other California city. But with controversy raging in the community, and the department itself on Friday expressing willingness to reexamine its tactics, the winds seem to be shifting toward change.
Whitman's comeback: "You know better than that, Jerry, that's a completely different thing." But to reporters afterward, Whitman declined to explain why that was different. Nor did Brown explain why "whore" was less offensive than a racial epithet for African Americans.

Athletes, media, officials and VIPs will have special access to "Games Lanes" on the city's Olympic Route Network (ORN). The lanes take up a third of the 109 miles of the ORN crisscrossing the British capital. This has infuriated drivers of taxis which, unlike emergency vehicles, have not been given special status. They have been banned, with local traffic, from using the designated lanes.
The Culture, Media and Sport committee is focused on whether News Corp. executives have misled it over the phone-hacking scandal, which involved voice-mail interceptions in the pursuit of tabloid scoops. Specifically, they're looking at which executives were aware that the practice allegedly went beyond one reporter at the recently closed News of the World tabloid and when they knew about it. The committee is due to hear from James Murdoch, News Corp.'s deputy chief operating officer and son of News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch, again on Nov. 10.

But you, in this critical race, have got to be the judge.
A. Only the tomatoes are going to need the cold protection in this garden. Your other crops can benefit from the chilly weather and tolerate both frosts and light freezes. Maybe you can add tall stakes round the tomato plantings to support covers that drape to the ground when cold is expected. If needed, small lights might also be added as a heat source. Make sure the lights are the type meant for use outdoors and do not touch the covers.

"I think to myself, `Why did I not come back here? I love this course,'" Lehman said. "It's just a testimony to how you can get something in your head, when things aren't going well. It's easy to say, `I don't like the golf course.'"
I became unpassable, despite dawdling along 3 m.p.h. below the limit. I felt like I had to be extra-courteous, just because people thought I was a cop. Drivers jumped to comply when I waved them out of parking spaces.

In doing so, Rapha seeks to capitalize on some of the best bike-building expertise available. It also aims to take advantage of the company's approach to the bicycling world.
But let's face it, they've been done. They've been done with grape jelly and ketchup. They've been done with beer and barbecue sauce. And they've been done with creamy gravies.
To be fair, the few games Marquez has played well he has made a difference. While he has just one assist this year, some of his passes, especially the longer ones from deep in midfield, have led to goals. But it just isn’t enough.
“It didn’t surprise me. They have the capabilities to do it. They just came out there and really imposed their will tonight.”
AKRON, Ohio -- Renee Strong, who handled scheduling for former Cuyahoga County Commissioner Jimmy Dimora, completed her testimony as prosecutors played several recorded phone conversations for jurors in U.S. District Court.
That doesn’t mean he’s a Patriots fan all of a sudden. Kitching bleeds blue – New York Giants blue – and one of his favorite players is Victor Cruz, the Giants dynamic wide receiver who went to UMass. Cruz and Patriots safety James Ihedigbo are both Minutemen alums, in fact.
Now add to these folks the number of ladies of the evening, morning and afternoon, the pickpockets, the find-or-steal-a-key-and-enter hotel creepers, the con men and the counterfeit T-shirt vendors (after one washing, your kid can claim her doll is the only one in the country that wears a Super Bowl T-shirt).

Corporate employers, their eyes firmly fixed on stock prices and the bottom line, prize flexibility over stability more than ever. The recession showed them they could do more with fewer workers than many of them previously realized.
"There have been dozens of visits to the state by the president, which tells me he has a problem there," said RNC political director Rick Wiley, exaggerating the number in a conference call Wednesday morning with reporters.
When in 2005 I reviewed Clayton's restaurant Nibblers in Pleasant Hill, I found his menu there, too, didn't live up to its big promise. But after a successful six-year run he recently repackaged Nibblers as a less ambitious neighborhood spot called the Fig Tree. (He made this transition at the same time he was opening Origen in October - and during a period when he lost two sous chefs and a general manager). So there are reasons to give Origen time to find its groove.
Although he substantially increased the Veterans Affairs budget, Derwinski infuriated veterans already upset over declining healthcare benefits when he proposed opening up two underused veterans hospitals to non-veterans. A proposal to eliminate smoking at the hospitals also proved unpopular.
"Judges make difficult decisions everyday- they deserve our protection and our respect," stated St. Clair County State's Attorney Brendan Kelly.
"It's this thing of people trying to discover this new ethnic cinema. They are in a hurry to put things together in a box and say this is what it is," said Lanthimos in an interview in Toronto last fall. "That's what I think is kind of annoying. All the films that we do are different from one another."

I think your observations are pretty insightful Bob. No team ever will measure up to the 1985 Bears in the eyes of Chicago fans, and every Bears team that has come after has suffered the consequences. And, yes, I have heard current players are resentful of the attention and adulation given the 85 team. Some members of the 85 team, meanwhile, don't understand why the current group doesn't appreciate them more, and find them disrespectful. It's an odd and unfortunate dynamic.
5. Bake for about 50 minutes, tossing twice during cooking and rotating pans in oven to ensure even heat distribution.
Also important to watch will be which of the passers outside the anointed top three will end up making names for themselves at the next level — judging by the depth behind Luck, Griffin III and Tannehill it’s pretty safe to assume there will be some teams getting a steal in the late rounds.
Poe may be broke, but he is famous, he insists. He has invented detective fiction and the suspense thriller. Stories such as "The Pit and the Pendulum," "The Cask of Amontillado" and "The Tell-tale Heart" have ensured his legend, and that poem about the black bird comes to mind every time we see such birds in the dingy skies above 1840s Baltimore (actually, Budapest and Belgrade).
I recently found out that many of my child's classmates have a Facebook account. That's probably not a big deal, except when you realize that few of the kids are old enough to register for an account. Facebook requires account holders to be at least 13. I bet at least half of those kids are not that old. Someone had to stretch the truth to get that account. I would guess that many of their parents are their Facebook friends, too, which in my mind only compounds the problem.
Police today are continuing the search for the suspect, who the victim said fled in a dark early 2000s-model four-door Chevy or Toyota, drove north through campus toward South Orange Avenue.

Mariya calls her children's schools almost daily, or comes to school crying. Her three teenage sons smoke and drink, even in front of Mariya and her husband. They go out at night, don't return home until morning and sometimes disappear for days. Her oldest dropped out of high school last year; another son did the same a few months ago. Her preteen daughter ran away from home.
The marketing claims "are designed to take advantage of parents' natural desire to provide every possible advantage for their young children," the complaint says. "The claims are false and misleading because the product does not teach babies to read."
"They’ll put that wording in, and hopefully they can get it done," he said.
"We need to work on being a better first-half team," Smith said. ""I think we were able to look at ourselves and tell we weren't doing right. We weren't shooting on the move very well and we concentrated on changing that in the second half."
“The administration and council will take this as a serious issue, but until we get some definitive information, there’s not going to be any rush to judgment,” he said. “We’re in unchartered territory right now.”

Stafford connected with Nate Burleson on a 5-yard pass into the end zone ruled incomplete on the field. It was overturned after video review, giving Detroit a four-point lead early in the fourth quarter. Burleson caught the ball and got both feet down, then lost the ball after tumbling beyond the end zone — a play similar to Johnson’s well-documented catch that was ruled incomplete last year at Chicago.
"We're checking if any policies and procedures were violated, and I think it's safe to say some were, because if you look at those 15-minute room checks, obviously had those been done, the incident couldn't have happened, or would have been caught a lot sooner," Barry said.
"This beautiful snow starts to fall, these big flakes start to fall down and float from the sky," says Fischer, who's best known for playing the lovably sane Pam on the NBC workplace sitcom. "If we had scripted that and if we had paid for that, that would have been hundreds of thousands of dollars to make that snow."

"I think it will be difficult for the plaintiffs challenging this," he said. "They are heavy on political rhetoric but light on legal arguments."
Jeff Burdick and his next-door neighbors have nearly identical two-story rowhouses, on the same block of East Clement Street with the same public schools and the same city trash pickup. But one striking difference is the $5,300 he pays in yearly property taxes — more than both his neighbors combined.
But just because tacos are simple, cheap and so utterly untrendy doesn't mean they can't be terrific eats. And Phoenix has so many good ones.
The Humane Society's Schmitz saw little room for compromise: "So far, they've said, 'We're willing to give an inch and we want you to give us a couple yards,' and that's not realistic."
Lynn faced the minimum through three innings thanks to a pickoff of Ryan Braun at first base. The reigning NL MVP has the only hit off Lynn through the first three innings.

A warmer Wednesday is ahead, with temperatures back above average again, where they will stay through the rest of the work week.
A pavane is a stately dance, with a clear beginning and a foreseen end. The word sounds melancholy, with an air of plangency that fits this achingly beautiful novel perfectly. First published in 1968 and reissued by Old Earth Books as a large-size paperback, "Pavane" is one of the masterworks of science fiction, a book that has won the admiration of such giants of the field as Neil Gaiman, China Mieville, Terry Pratchett, Christopher Priest and William Gibson. On the cover, George R.R. Martin calls the book "a masterpiece ... one of the greatest alternate world stories ever told."
"I think they both have such an incredible respect for each other," he said. "I think one of the things LeBron picked up from Kobe is attention to detail. The jump that he has made, to me, has been paying attention to detail. I would watch him shoot before games and I felt like his release was different, his footwork wasn't always the game. Now he's paying attention to detail. I see his game getting better and better and better. Kobe has always been about precision. He has always been the master of his craft."
That can't happen soon enough.

"No question about it," Miller said when asked if he believed the suspension was a turning point.
Culprits: Many politicians from both parties were recipients of campaign contributions from the Fannie and Freddie slush funds, though Democrats had their hands much deeper in the cookie jar. The Bush administration has a very dismal economic record, but the White House does deserve some credit for having tried to rein in Fannie and Freddie earlier this decade. Opponents, led by Democrats Barney Frank in the House and Chris Dodd in the Senate, blocked reforms that would have saved huge amounts of money for taxpayers.
Groups that support business interests have been aligned with the GOP for decades. The U.S. Chamber has been around for 100 years; the Club for Growth for about a dozen.

Therefore, your child must - without compromising his manners - say something to establish his solidarity with the maligned child, or by default he seems an ally of the parents.

Homer tells us what happened but not why. Miller's "Song of Achilles" provides that back story, an exegesis that draws the personal and the intimate out of Homer's virile action adventure. Miller searched ancient Greek texts for every mention of Patroclus. She found an exile and an outcast and created for us a lonely, isolated child with a streak of appealing sadness. He catches the eye of the golden boy Achilles and grows up beside him, becoming not simply companion and friend, but dearer to Achilles than all the world.
Thuring said that although he wrote his thesis about paintings by 16th-century Italian artists Lorenzo Lotto and Titian, he found that studying earlier periods of art provided a “very solid basis” for working on contemporary art.
Diane Allen, Salisbury's provost, said that nine of the state's 24 teachers of the year in 2011 graduated from Salisbury and that the university has had a strong teacher education program.

So when C.J. Sapong scored on a header two minutes into the second half, it was the only goal Kansas City would need. The sequence began with hard-luck goalkeeper Dan Kennedy getting a hand on a Graham Zusi blast from the edge of the penalty area. An inch higher and the shot would have gone over the net. Instead, it hit the crossbar and bounced back to Zusi, who headed it forward, allowing Sapong to redirect it into the goal.
In 2009, the Missouri NASP, along with the Missouri Department of Conservation and the Conservation Federation of Missouri, started the statewide tournament.

McDonald, Steen and Perron can make a difference. The Kings didn't have to deal with them much in the four regular-season encounters. It will be interesting to see how the three Blues can put their stamp on what should be a tense, close, low-scoring series.
GREENBURGH, N.Y. (WTW) — Amare Stoudemire says there's a "great chance" he can play in Game 4 of the Knicks' series against Miami on Sunday despite cutting his left hand on a fire extinguisher case.
Obama has made a strictly political move. He is taking the calculated risk that making this "evolved" decision public will be advantageous for his reelection campaign with certain groups and certainly with the media. What he really believes is unknown, since he has been less than honest with the public in the past. What might happen if America is so foolish as to give him another four years in the White House is anyone's guess. Other "evolving" ideas will be more shocking than this revelation.
Concordia was founded by Djokic in 1997. Although she has made her home in the San Francisco Bay area since 2004, she maintains strong local ties.

A second man charged in the killings, Bryant "Smoke" Lee, will be tried separately.
Mr. Gingrich has also shown an ability to work across the political aisle; for all his bluster as speaker of the House in the 1990s, his partnership with President Bill Clinton was strikingly productive. But other elements of his time as speaker, and his performance during the current campaign, demonstrate his unsuitability for the presidency. He has big ideas, but he lacks focus. He has a tendency toward the grandiose, casting himself as a central figure in a historical struggle. We don't need that kind of drama. We need results.
My father is probably rolling over in his grave, Steegman said. Her father, she said, was a union steward at the General Motors Tech Center who made sure his children voted Democratic.

Of course, as we speak, al Qaeda and their affiliates continue to plan attacks against us. Thanks to our intelligence and law enforcement professionals, we are disrupting plots and securing our cities and skies.

Opposition activists are seeking to use questions that were raised in December about Mr. Shuvalov's finances to put pressure on the Kremlin. Activist Natalya Pelevine filed a formal request earlier this year asking prosecutors to investigate whether Mr. Shuvalov's transactions with a tycoon and his role in later government decision to grant loan guarantees for the tycoon's company violated any Russian laws. Her request came after similar allegations were reported in December in Barron's.

LaMarcus Aldridge led the Blazers with 22 points, but the Portland offense stagnated in the fourth quarter and overtime as a six-point lead at the end of the third quarter evaporated.
Maryland's slots gambling program, legalized in 2008, has been slow to start, with only two of the five parlors now open — one in Cecil County and another on the Eastern Shore. Maryland voters approved legalized gambling in part to support the racing industry with slots revenue.

Is their reluctance to implement a vigorous teacher evaluation system based on a lack of money or a lack of stomach? It is not always easy work. Being honest with Good Old Joe, the wit of the teacher lounge, and telling him that he just isn't cutting it is not a pleasant task.

Its three floors of interactive exhibitions are a potent cocktail of criminals, government officials and the media.

But the course of Syria's yearlong rebellion suggests that things could change again in Idlib. Assad's military is professional and well-equipped, but many reports from inside the country suggest the security forces are stretched thin, and some soldiers and officers wearying of their brutal task continue to defect. In the past, opposition activists and armed dissidents have been able to filter back once the tanks departed for the next mission.
Not to be confused with Google Goggles  an app that lets you search for anything just by snapping a photo  Google's glasses superimpose what's known as a head's up display (HUD) over your visual field. The visual display provides contextual information and lets you do just about anything a smartphone would, from texting and geosocial check-ins to turn-by-turn directions  all without lifting a finger. Of course, Google's conception of this ties right into its umbrella of products, from Maps and Latitude to Google+. According to the minds behind Project Glass, technology should "be there when you need it and get out of your way when you don't".

Other analysts, however, said US Airways wouldn't offer much help in key markets such as Asia, where American is weaker than United and Delta. Its hubs, including Charlotte, N.C., and Phoenix, are in the kind of secondary cities from which American has been retreating. And such a deal would merge two airlines with already poor labor relations and pilots represented by different unions.
Starr floated a cost-cutting plan during budget committee discussions in May, but it failed to gain a second vote. At the time, he proposed cutting $500,000 in wages by the end of the calendar year.
Funny thing, I don't think he picked on me much after that either.
After moving to the South, "I started writing these funny songs about my life because in Nashville, I'd take all these songwriting classes and each one said the same exact thing: ‘Write about what you know. Write about what you know - it comes from a pure place, it comes from an honest place and it gives you a lot of material to write about,' " Fabisch said. "At that time I had two little kids, a lot of diapers and laundry and what should I make for dinner?' I just started writing songs about that . . . and sort of on the funny side. The audience really, really responded to it. They thought it was different and entertaining and so I kept going."

"I couldn't ignore what happened," he said. "But since the play is about healing, I thought, OK, this is the central motif. In my own actor-brain, it's part of the show. I don't try to hide it. But I do try to make it look easy. That's my job."
"In that sense, it is like stepping back in time. It's the same when we first started, when we didn't understand how it worked. Getting people to hear it and share it is the priority. Making money off the album won't be the priority."

Washington, of course, is the real target of the sound-money movement, because a patchwork of state laws is not going to move the nation any closer to a gold standard. Even the gold debit-card system wouldn't work well without a change in federal law: Each transaction would subject card users to a 28 percent federal capital gains tax on the underlying coins.
Pattonville defeated Francis Howell Central and Howell North before falling to Francis Howell 21-7 in its district finale to take second place.
Prieta quake of 1989. It ripples away from the fault line, through the crust and across the Bay Area at 13,000 miles per hour. Under the Great Highway, already full of early commuters. Under Sunset Reservoir. Under the streets lined with homes Malvina Reynolds dismissed as made of "ticky-tacky," homes that didn't exist a century ago but that today are filled with thousands of sleeping families.
It's such a shame when Walmarts come to town. They close the mom-and-pop stores. Walmart and Sam's seem to have no regard for the neighborhood. The Walmart-Sam's complex in Maplewood - they don't cut the grass. Instead of picking up the cans and the paper and the cardboard and the cups, they just drive right over it and grind it all up in the lawn. It looks horrible. I guess they're not using their heads. Or they don't care to use their heads. Maybe that's it.

For now, they're talking. They recently met in a lawyer's conference room downtown in an attempt to make peace. Not because they've rekindled some old friendship, but because Judge James F. Schneider gave the order: Draft a plan to take the publisher, Alter Communications Inc., out of Chapter 11 and bring the proposal in by Oct. 21 — or he would name a trustee to run the business.

Every time I pushed or pulled unevenly on the pedals, though, the trainer emitted a loud, high-pitched squeak, alerting me with a yelp I'd done something wrong. The only way to avoid this, I learned, was to maintain a smooth, balanced stroke, a habit certain to pay huge dividends if it becomes ingrained.
A widespread power outage led to controlled chaos Thursday throughout San Diego County, Baja California, part of Arizona and other areas as about 5 million people coped with the sudden loss of electricity.

Honest, we called because it would be nice to hear him rejoice in his craft again — and there was a fair amount of that in a 20-minute Skype chat from Istanbul — not to elicit his regrets.
Either way, "Antidot" is a mischievous treat that makes paperless offices look sterile. A principal offering in this year's San Francisco International Arts Festival, Liquid's West Coast debut is presented by SFIAF and the Society of Living Traditions, which brought it to Mendocino County last weekend.

I realize it's rich of me to declare that an advice-slinger is not responsible for any advisory fallout. But the nature of advice and the fact of adult autonomy combine to reduce your liability here to almost nothing. You say you thought it was good advice; if you gave it with care and without a hidden agenda, then you served as nothing more than one of many sources of information.
On Monday, families held a memorial for Fournier, a 48-year-old Garden Grove resident, the last of eight services that have together drawn thousands of mourners.

Debate over how to increase minority representation in the Legislature — especially for the fast-growing Hispanic and Asian populations — has dominated the once-in-a-decade redistricting process.
