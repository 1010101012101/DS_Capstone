Vick's story is interesting. But it's not more important than the ones of the graduates of Camelot. Not more significant to society. Not more redeeming. Not more impressive.

Inspired by Olmec culture, the city of Teotihuacan, about 25 to 30 miles northeast of Mexico City, is one of the country's most-visited ancient cities.

The band is still shaking hands with the new material. “We Are Alive,” the biblical resurrection narrative rewritten in the language of a protest folk ballad, never found a steady tempo. “Rocky Ground,” which attempts to introduce rapping into the Boss’ usual stately rock balladry, didn’t gel. But it is clear that Springsteen is energized by the “Wrecking Ball” songs and eager to spread its gospel: He spoke to the audience about the perils of income inequality, and announced his intention to “put a whoop-ass session on the recession.”
With a PS2 price cut to $99 -- and, really, who can ignore a bargain like that? -- the gaming industry takes a step backward and begins hoping even harder for a fast economic turnaround so it can resume make oodles more money.

The much-anticipated daylong discussion, however, appeared to leave the two sides far from even an interim agreement on how to overcome the dispute, which has raised fear of a spiraling war in the Middle East. Yet Western officials said Iran's agreement to even talk should be counted as progress, as the Islamic Republic has repeatedly walked away from attempts to force it to negotiate curbs on its nuclear program.

"I'm from Texas," she wrote, " and we're just not used to that kind of treatment."

Of the five Minnesota companies that gained spots on the Fortune list, Mosaic Co. added the most -- up 78 spots on the strength of a 32 percent gain in revenues at the global fertilizer company. Ecolab Inc. (No. 365) whose annual revenues were $6.8 billion rose 13 spots, but the St. Paul -based company is poised to rise further on Fortune's 2012 list as it fully integrates the acquisition of Nalco, which it acquired in the fourth quarter last year. Analysts expect the two companies when fully combined will have annual revenue of about $12 billion, enough to put Ecolab in the top half of Fortune's list.

The modern room, with an open kitchen backed by a brushed-metal wall, might have looked like something out of "The Jetsons" to a child in the 1960s. Don't despair, contemporary diner. The dishes might sound old-fashioned; the preparations are not. They are interesting, visually appealing, sometimes whimsical and usually delicious takes on what chef/owner Brian Okin calls "creative comfort food." On our first visit, my wife and I went with one of those creations, pigs in a blanket. Verve's version is terrific. In this dish, the "pig" is the best bits from trotters (pig's feet). The "blanket" is a bread-crumb crust. Crispy, deep-fried balls are served with a fruity mostarda dipping sauce and shaved pecorino cheese. Our second appetizer, seared scallops, was also a gem. Sweet, moist scallops were served over creamy polenta. Smoky bacon cubes gave the polenta added flavor and texture. Snapper and mussels was a dazzling, healthful plate consisting of fresh seared fish and steamed mussels on a bed of spaghetti squash with a fragrant beer/ginger broth. Pork and cabbage was, again, nothing like what I remembered -- a generous serving of two bone-in rib chops, nicely grilled and served with a flavorful stuffing of shiitake mushrooms, truffle spaetzel, braised cabbage and buttery bread crumbs.

In the past month, financial markets have turned their sights on Ireland and Portugal. Doubts remain over the solvency of banks on Europe's stricken fringe. That leaves them dependent on Mr. Trichet's largesse, in the form of "temporary" lending facilities introduced by the ECB when the crisis first hit.
In happier circumstances, you would encounter the juicy crab and pork buns in their natural habitat, the new San Gabriel dumpling house Wang Xing Ji. A single specimen fills out an entire small steamer and must be approached cautiously, as if an undefused bomb.
Walls and doors are painted black—a contrast to Barcelona's general love of brighter colors.

Paterno was in no condition to speak up for himself early Saturday as he battled for his life. He was lucky to have plenty of loved ones around to do it for him.

One of the joys of the All-Star Game is that it caters to the fans. It gives them the players they most want to see and the players who are most deserving*. It not only invites the audience to participate, it uses who they want to see to draw the fans in to watch who they should see. I have no problem with a popularity contest. You can show me a player who is popular and having a bad season, but I dare you to show me a player who is popular and had a bad career.

Dear F.G.: Begin by taking the bag back to the Coach store and ask the experts for their advice. If they don't have a suggestion, you might want to follow the advice of the leather experts at Chanel.

The ability to cook food, Wrangham says, would have allowed early humans to spend less time looking for food and given them more expendable energy. It could help explain, among other body changes, why human teeth became smaller — less need to spend time chewing. It could have reduced the time between births, allowing for population growth, and perhaps allowed for the development of a larger brain.

Don, who to his credit, wears his usual tailored suit (he looks "square," Megan tells him) and Harry, in a loud plaid jacket (I doubt fashion lines will be hurrying to imitate this season's plaid jacket trend with quite the speed they jumped on Don's slim-cut suits) get backstage at the Stones' concert venue. Well, they get into a hallway outside the closed doors where the stars are. Trying to get past a security guard, Harry says they're here to see the Rolling Stones. Or their manager, Allen Klein.

The work before us is a collective effort. Teachers understand the power of collaborating with their colleagues, and principals are effective when they lead with the support of their entire school community.

A woman says she used to be sober but has not been to the club in two years and was afraid to come back. During those years, drinking and smoking crack, she would duck when she saw anyone from the club around town. As she tells her story, crying and wiping her eyes, I feel close to my own higher power. The world I barreled through all day distills down to this warm cocoon of love and attention. Tears well up.

Linda Wilson: I believe the construction you are referring to is the city of Webster Groves project to replace the Murdoch bridge over the railroad just north of I-44. This construction has closed Murdoch starting Monday of this week. It also closed one of the ramps to I-44.

"In the worst case, you would get no discount," said Richard Hutchinson, who manages the MyRate program for Progressive. He's says the company won't use the information to raise rates for people who prove themselves to be bad drivers.

So, for those who aren't able to earn at least a small discount, it probably wouldn't make sense to participate, Hutchinson said.

No business person in his right mind wants to anger readers, advertisers, neighbors, friends, colleagues. But one of the realities of journalism, Turpin would remind us, is that newspapers aren't just a business. They come with added burdens and responsibilities. And one of those tasks is to point out the truth, however uncomfortable, as best as it can be determined. I don't mean truth in some godlike, omniscient way delivered from paragons of virtue. And Turpin never looked at the profession or its practitioners that way either. I mean reporting on the truth as it is determined from the facts at hand, as fairly and accurately and responsibly as possible.

Enter the novelist. He started writing his book in 2007 after his son, Jackson (now 11), began school and his wife, Nina Hale, started a successful online marketing company.

In my view, the reason for the incidents is the nature of policing has changed. Following the 9/11 attacks, officers have convinced themselves that every member of the public is a potential threat.

Which, in the end, is the fear at the core of every dystopian movie — the worry that what separates us from animals, or saves us from mere pointless anonymity, is a thin and easily erasable line.

These are dishes that succeed best with minimal seasoning and interference. But when a chef's touch is needed, Phillips can go sideways. For instance, a strong dose of garlic, and even salt, would have saved an otherwise worthwhile scampi dish from rampant blandness. When ceviche is prepared by marinating in citrus juices, it can offer astringent pleasure. But here, lightly seared and tarted up with sweet fruit juices, it loses appeal.

He ushered me into a cluttered yard filled with more gargoyles and his latest experiments  exploding pots made from the clay he digs up in his backyard. Most clay shrinks in firing, but this clay body expands and froths and breaks open in the firing process.

It also keeps the structure of Brown's initial proposal intact: The anticipated $9 billion in revenue for 2012-13 would go into a fund dedicated to schools, freeing up billions of dollars to pay down the projected $9.2 billion deficit.

There's only street parking, although it's not difficult. The locker room is bright and airy, with skylights and fresh white paint.

Because the main courses don't come with accompaniments, diners will probably want to order at least one of the six contorni, whether it's creamy cooked fresh cranberry beans liberally doused in Tuscan olive oil ($7) or a small pile of spinach with garlic and red chile flakes ($6).

The examples of Dallas Dance's supervisory abilities given in the article "Meet Mr. Dance" (April 8) are of concern. A principal should not have to wait for a visit from a supervisor to have a sewage problem repaired or a broken card swiper fixed. Those are indications of a school system that is not responsive to the needs of the local schools. Mr. Dance has not stayed in a job long enough to gauge the success or failure of his policies. His enthusiasm and energy are welcome, but they do not compensate for his lack of experience.

Based on the average selling price for Iran's main heavy export crude, this fall in production would have deprived the country of around $3 billion in revenue over the quarter.

They think it looks to the public like it's cleaner."

On Sunday, I attended mass with my 79-year-old grandmother. Two months ago, she lost her husband, my grandfather. Ever since that day, she could not have a more positive attitude about moving onward in her life. This strength she so fervently displays day to day, she wholeheartedly attributes to her faith. As her top admirer, and as someone who had considered herself a faithful Catholic for much of her life, I decided to begin attending church again to discover this unyielding faith my grandmother seems to possess. It was going well until Sunday.

Conservatives will no doubt see the interlock research as another example of liberal interventionism, a government initiative to impose extra costs on consumers to protect them from themselves. But that's pretty much the way they felt about Ralph Nader's pioneering investigations of automotive safety in the mid-1960s, which led to the creation of the NHTSA and such standard features as seatbelts -- and that worked out OK. Thanks largely to Nader, today's cars are loaded with safety features designed to protect us from our own bad driving. If sensors can thwart drunk drivers in an unobtrusive way, they could save thousands of lives. And if the research shows that they fail at an unacceptable rate, or they catch too many drivers who aren't legally drunk, they're unlikely to attract the political support needed for approval. The restaurant industry is trying to quash the program before these questions are answered; I'd rather wait until the data are in to decide whether or not to reject the interlock concept.

Because Ohio's population is growing more slowly than other states, Ohio's legislature had to eliminate two seats when it redrew the congressional map this year.

It did the same thing to a pair of longtime Democratic Congress members-- Cleveland's Dennis Kucinich and Toledo's Marcy Kaptur.

A: I can be quite taken up with films. I can be taken with a story, even if I'm in a film and I know what the story is and everything. If I haven't seen a film for a long time, there will be scenes I remember, and of course part of you is remembering where you were and that part of your life. They're kind of like a little diary of where you were at.... I'm very easily pleased in films. I'm a great lover of films.
Socha is the protagonist of the film, but Holland creates a dual reality: that above ground and that below, in the rat-infested sewers. The Jews living there make moving attempts at a normal life in the darkness (a darkness that, while dramatically powerful, makes it harder to get to know and relate to the characters residing there). It's like an alternate universe. A girl sings for the group. Affairs take place; one man cheats on his wife while she and their daughter lie a few feet away, presumably sleeping. A child is born. And, of course, people die. So many people die, in such horrific ways.

Couzens realized that if he didn't speak out, the story would never be told  and no one would truly understand what he says happened to him, Brian Teeman and Chuck Caffrey.
"That's one of the most valuable awards in the league," coach Ken Hitchcock said. "That went from a checking award to a two-way award. You look at the players who are there, they're 200-foot players. Every player that gets nominated now is a guy that's able to contribute offensively but is a conscientious two-way performer. I'm really proud of him. He personifies the way we want to play the game. The way we want to be seen in the NHL. I think that award is almost as valuable as the most valuable player award. I believe anyone who wins that award with the way the game of hockey is played now, that's a significant award to win because it's now being looked at in a different environment. ... He could be a different player. He could get more points but we wouldn't get as many wins. He's bit the bullet in some areas so the team could win."

That's why more districts should convert to year-round programs similar to those in other countries. A year-round calendar, with several shorter breaks instead of a three-month summer vacation, makes more sense for contemporary families. Working parents would have fewer child-care hours to cover.

A: Because most of the fruit comes on new growth, it is best to wait until fruit has set so you can prune around it. Master Gardener Rita Hutt trims her citrus trees two to three times a year all over because she has a small yard, but she cautions against pruning too much at a time and being sure to prune only if the trees are healthy. By trimming upward I mean pruning from the bottom up. Often the best fruit is on the bottom third of the tree.

In an op-ed column encouraging the passage of the “Penn State bill,” The Oregonian’s Susan Nielsen advocated for other preventive measures, including increased communication with children on the subject of abuse, improved public awareness about how and to whom to report abuse, and building trust in the reporting process. Those are laudable goals, but they are not, as the column said, “the least we can do.” The least we can do is what 40 other states, including California and Washington, have done: Make it a crime for mandatory reporters to violate their reporting obligation.
