The show was well run and my thanks to Don Lavin and Daniel Zazove on a very smooth show. I'm sure generally brisk sales added to the overall good vibe, but when you have that many pen guys spending the weekend together and you don't hear any grumbling, that's quite an accomplishment!
I know it has been a while since my last post, but I haven't been feeling well. Rather than me bellyaching, let's just say my MS has really kicked me in the butt.. well, actually, this time it has hit my arms. (The left is worst than ever, but the right is slowly regaining strength/sensation... praise heaven!!) I've been feeling quite useless and down as of late. You know what - disease sucks! Well, that's all together another story for another time. Luckily, I have a strong support network and I am working through this latest hurtle.

This time around consumers want to have conversations with us and "co-create." All we have to do is give them "compelling content" and get all social with them.
Wow. Exercising discipline in portion control is hard enough for myself. What about with this child who says over and over again, "Want toast?" Everything in me wants to reward his "using his words" by giving him food. Everything in me wants to make sure that he will thrive. Everything in me wants to love him by giving him food. But I know that food is actually not love. Love is love.

The dispute over staffing and quality in North London and Herts Newspapers has been resolved. The dispute in Enfield had centred on non-replacement of journalists at the Tindle newspaper group’s titles and led to a strike in April. The NUJ chapel had recently voted to take further strike action.

Living in the country: being a parent: going to the cinema. It's possible to combine any two of these activities but not, I've found, all three. Since my son was born in 2002 I've barely been to the pictures at all, except to take him to see the occasional Pixar movie. But last night he was staying with one of his friends, so Sarah and I ventured down to the Barn cinema at Dartington to watch Monsters, an ambitious low-budget sci-fi road movie by the young British director Gareth Edwards. (In my day, young British directors only did cheesy mockney gangster flicks, so whatever you think of his film you have to admit that ambitious sci-fi road movies are a step in the right direction.)
Next, pile on those veggies. Lots of leafy spinach, thick slices of sweet Vidalia onion and handfuls of mushrooms. If it begins to majorly look like rabbit food, you're doing good.

This is what Zen Buddhism speaks of in its emphasis on non-dualism – it's not about choosing one pole over the other, but in recognising that seeing the world in terms of pairs of opposites is not a helpful viewpoint, or 'skillful means': that this is a relative choice, and that looking directly into the nature of everything, perceiving the whole interconnectedness, allows us to see that these are arbitrary distinctions that we make, and that we have a choice about whether we buy into them, or whether we choose to work to bring the poles together in ourselves and thus in the world.

This meaningless design, which the EU Commission squandered £112,000 of taxpayers’ money on, has a few squiggly lines on the top, a block of blue on the bottom and in a box with the EU’s noose of gold stars, the words ‘European Commission’ – I’m sure we are all thrilled to have spent so much money on this!
While Frances needs to gain a little more connection with the audience, it was the first show, and everyone is growing. While her hunky male dancers were “gyrating” with her and giving a rocky vibe with a new edge to the song choice of a Soul sultress, Wood managed to perform a Chaka Khan song that most would never be able to do with such integrity.

I have scrap lifted a many of times and this weekend my choice was one from Janna Wilson that I saw in Scrapbooks etc magazine April 2011 issue because it looked simple. It was quiet a challenge though. You have to study the layout and figure how they got things done a certain way. I like to get creative sometimes and change things up mostly because of what I have in my stash. It took longer than I had planned. I tried the flowers she made but they came out awful so I put them on a card come back tomorrow to see that. But here is my take and the next letter of the alphabet C- featuring Cosmo Crickets Lovey Dovey.
Meanwhile, Latinos attracted by affordable housing have settled in the area and now make up about 64% of the population. Latino-owned businesses have cropped up along the main corridors. Mexican grocery stores are thriving. Immigrants flock to money-wiring outlets to send funds to relatives in Mexico and Central America. Spanish has become the language most commonly heard in the streets of South Los Angeles.

Only a small group – 12 percent – of the companies in the survey said they felt they were currently effective users of social media.

I was busy this weekend making chocolate covered chocolate eggs for all my family back on the east coast. I had 25# of chocolate wafers and run out. I did get 137 eggs done with all my families favorite fillings: Coconut, Peanut Butter, Caramel, Chocolate Truffle and Marshmallow. It was my first time making homemade marshmallow filling because I thought it would be hard to make but WOW really easy to make. When I went to mail out my six boxes of candy I made sure my favorite post office workers got some of the egg too. Here are some of the filling I did...
Hello! I am Roberta from Prairie Fairy Designs. I am a digital stamp company featuring artwork not only created by me but also my two kids, ages 9 and 12. They are featured on the site as the Fairy Princess and the Prairie Prince.I have been an artist for as long as I can remember and have always loved to create. Two years ago my sister-in-law invited me to a rubber stamp party. I laughed and said "Maybe I will buy something if I can use it to stamp on canvases.". Needless to say, I was hooked! Two years later, a lot of learning about computers, and a few setbacks with web stuff (I am so not tech savvy!) I finally accomplished my goal. We have been around since the spring and still growing.

It’s great to see woodland being worked in this way, providing continuity between the historic coppicing of Hazel for the iron industry and the present day.

Again, the Singer group is within their right to be present within their building. They are within their right to make their opinion known through whatever channels they choose – be it speech, whispers, or yes, song. But, they must be held to the same standard as every other group. The fact that you have allowed them to dictate the policy is profoundly sad. I request that you immediately rectify this situation, and require the same process of any organization or group, including the Solidarity Singers, both now and in the future.

I feel bad ranking Kesse this low, since this isnt bad by any means and is probably her best photo (Sad, right?) but its so bland. I do like it picked apart, the swimsuit looks amazing on her and her skin is nice and her face is intense, and the body isnt too bad, but s a whole, I just dont like. It could just be my general dislike of Kesse, but I just dont love it.

Ashia started Abaya Collection in 2008 having started wearing the abayah at 19. Frustrated with the lack of variety and dismayed with the black styles of Abaya's being the only type available, she decided to invest in fabrics which she worked closely with her tailor on creating. Having always had a creative streak from a young age, Ashia was able to create and design innovative Abaya's which were well received from both family and friends.

It could be argued that some of these activities are no more dangerous than getting in the car in the morning and driving to work. Considering the safety measures involved in the case of something like skydiving, a quick spin in a Chevy would most likely be far more dangerous.
The American bishops, assembled in the Seventh Provincial Council of Baltimore, May 5-13, 1849, had given a favorable reply to both questions (in decrees I and II, on May 12), informing the Holy Father that the faithful in the United States were animated with a great devotion to the Immaculate Conception, and that they the bishops, would be pleased if the Holy Father declared the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception an article of faith.

I am faced with the dilemma of what to do with my beloved, classic, hand-built-from-reclaimed-lumber Adirondack chair. Do I attempt to take it apart and replace the damaged wood? Do I give it another coat of paint and hope for the best? Do I convert it to some kind of planter for my flowers? Do I just give in and burn it in the firepit? What would you do with a classic?

Spinning worlds out of language, writers require us to attend, to read, to listen. The best writers are also those who listen, whether it be to the speech of others or to the messages they hear in the language of leaves or rocks or ocean. Patricia Lee Lewis enters that rank of skilled listeners with High Lonesome, her second book of poems. In this book, Patricia forefronts the art of listening as a dynamic act of connection.
"Michelle Obama - A Life" is not a book. It is an extended article of about 17 pages (Kindle pages, that is!), a summary of her biography, with very little new information, even for me, who, here in Germany, has not seen or read that much about Mrs. Obama in the news on TV or in papers and magazines.

But that's an organizational decision.
Back in the 1960s we did not use the term ethnic cleansing. We used terms such as “resettlement”, “relocation”, “blackspot removals”, “forced removals”. The term ethnic cleansing came into use in English during the Wars of the Yugoslav Succession in the 1990s, but it accurately describes what was going on in South Africa between 1950 and 1990, so I have used it in this article. The definition of ethnic cleansing is “the planned deliberate removal from a specific territory, persons of a particular ethnic group, by force or intimidation, in order to render that area ethnically homogenous.”[6]
Leaving, for me, was one of the most difficult things I have ever had to do. And I say “had to do”, because I have this very well honed sense of self-preservation. I no longer felt safe in SA. I didn’t like living in a prison called home. The hijackings of cyclists really put me off. Erratic bills from the Joburg City Council and zero recourse (I had to pay R32 000 for a “clearance certificate” on selling the house, promised a refund, nothing six months on), we’ve been victims of crime too many times, crumbling roads, deteriorating water quality (we used to wakeboard on the Vaal river – no more), absurd police force, even more outrageous and absurd “government”. You know all the reasons; having experienced them in person, and increasingly understanding that there was a gaping chasm in my personal moral and ethical makeup and that of South African society, it was clear that getting out was the only option.

There was someone by the door selling copies of his book. After some quick research I learned that Chris was there because of his last book, The Fire Ascending.

On the positive side: I visited some rental spots in the morning before I had to be at the office, and even though I had to deal with the Weirdest Cabbie I’ve Ever Encountered (and I’ve taken I lot of cabs in my time, my friends) – I found a townhouse for us when we move. We’re renting for the first year or so, to get the lay of the land before we settle anywhere, and this place is perfect. On the west side, only about 15 minutes from work, with a Urgent Care clinic and grocery store and other shopping nearby (hellloooooooo, a Brennan’s Market, just down the street). So anyway, I think we’ll like it there. I hope.
So you think they are buying time. But for what?
Actually the exposure of this bit was for me stretching of incredulity just a little too far when initially revealed but then I quickly did see the point of it. Also the book doesn't successfully end - this is because it is part one in a trilogy but I still feel there could have been a better wrap up of some of the hanging threads but then I suppose there'd be less incentive to buy the next volume.

In Episode 9 we get reviews for Angry Birds Space and Fibble: Flick ‘n’ Roll and Kinect Rush: A Disney Pixar Adventure, while in Episode 10 we get reviews for PokePark 2: Wonders Beyond and Kinect Star Wars. You may be wondering about where the Kid Icarus: Uprising review is, but if you watch Episode 9, then you’ll see that one of the questions in the Ask Good Game segment is if they’ll be doing a Kid Icarus: Uprising review and Bajo says that they’ll be doing one in Episode 11, so next time! Speaking of Kid Icarus, I’ve finished the game and will be writing a review on it the moment I get a chance, infact, if I do it before the end of week then I would’ve published a review on it before Good Game: SP! That’d be cool, but I can’t guarantee, that’s just what I’m aiming to do…

So after taking a long uncharacteristic hiatus, they finally released Human Hearts. While the other albums were important stepping stones of self-discovery, I think this record is the pinnacle of what they’ve been moving towards… and it only took a 4 year break. "Annihilation Eyes" may be the best song they've ever recorded and this record is more balanced between upbeat and slower songs than in the past and the result is probably their best work yet…
Rape, especially over the past half-century since it became a war crime, is a problematic issue in any novel that contains it, but even more when the rape of a (male) child is involved. Several reviews of Arslan focus on the shock and discomfort found when encountering the rape of Hunt Morgan in the opening chapter of the book. Since Hunt's complex relationship with Arslan forms an integral part of the novel, perhaps it is best to explore the ways in which this rape is used. Engh certainly does not sensationalize, nor does she dismiss with a cavalier attitude, Hunt's rape. Rather, his rape becomes a concrete metaphor that works on several levels: the representation of the plight of youth of both sexes in war-torn areas (the fact that the US hasn't suffered this since the end of the Civil War is harped upon in passages like the one quoted at the beginning of this review); the degradation of power relationships along the lines of imperialist resource/people exploitation (here shown in reverse); the terrorization that is unleashed on District 3281 in the immediate aftermath of Arslan's triumphant entry into the city. This does not diminish the reactions engendered by Arslan's rape of Hunt, but it does serve to provide a context in which Hunt's later actions can be seen as much more than a sickening case of sympathy for one's own tormenter.
Rochita: For many writers coming from colonized nations, the act of putting words on paper is fraught with certain matters. In this, I speak from my own experience of Filipino literature, how it was taught to me and how I absorbed what Filipino literature means to the Filipino.
At the last work group meeting, the City Administrator said that they will have another meeting of the work group prior to the May 16th City Council meeting where the CAO is supposed to report the results of the work group. As of this writing, no meeting of the work group is scheduled. Realistically, no prosecutions can take place until the City has developed a clear plan for implementation and a means of enforcement.

I had a really wonderful day and more than being on the river really appreciated the chance to share something nice with my friends, free from modern distractions (we all though it best to leave our phones in the cars!).

No. No, it was none of those things. It was that my boss had seen me doing a massive project that hadn't been assigned to me. The person it had been assigned to is, excuse me, out of her league on this one. And I could do it. It was giving me a headache and making me hate life, but I could do it faster than anyone else I could think of. And I didn't mind doing it.

Having said that, Cuba is also claimed by the Human Rights Watch to have repressed nearly all forms of political dissent, and it has the second-highest number of imprisoned journalists of any nation in the world, bested only by China.

My bullying happened before the days of anti-bullying education, a topic that comes up so much in today’s middle school classroom that my eighth-grade daughter says she is sick of hearing about it. Back then, if you were bullied could muster up enough courage to tell a teacher or school administrator about it, you were basically told to ignore the bully. Don’t be a snitch. Stand up for yourself, and eventually, they will go away.

In the months since the Lehman debacle, the U.S. has no more lost its ability to grow and innovate than reality-TV producers have lost their ability to coax skanky behavior out of New Jersey’s youth. And despite all the headwinds, there’s no reason the expansion that started in July 2009 can’t go on as long as the previous three, which lasted 73 months, 120 months, and 92 months, respectively. When the definitive history of this period is written, it is possible—no, likely—that this post-bust era will go down not as a time of economic decline, but as one of regeneration."

The so-called “survival seminars” offered by Bobby Joe Fanin and his pet bovine are not just some soldier-of-fortune-style of ripping the stupid off for a few bucks, but are a ruse to draw in the unwitting and stupid into a Luciferian rite to honor Loki, with seminar attendees offered up as a sacrifice to their dark lord.

It was clear from day one that the Anglo-American empire, along with its clients like Qatar, were actively supporting and planning to bring destablization to the country. From the very first days of the civil war in Janurary 2011, before the shell casings had even hit the ground, western envoys and consultants worked with known al-Qaida fighters and criminals in Libya to form a new NTC government, a new central bank and a new state oil holding company. NATO were deployed to give brutal air support to these new gangs of rebel paramilitaries, and for nearly 10 months, both those groups killed, tortured, raped and looted everything in their path.

I just recently learned about Search Engine Optimization or SEO. I didn’t see the big deal. Then I read some articles. I realized what a huge deal it actually is not only for journalists, but also for pretty much anyone who is trying to get recognition through the Internet. It’s hard enough for journalists to get their work noticed and read, but to have to fight with SEO presents another roadblock. The question comes up whether journalists should be focused on writing the best story or writing it to cater to SEO.
Just last summer we went with friends on their boat through this same canal. The weather then couldn’t have been more different compared to the weather yesterday.

I often tell my son (and mean it) that he can be absolutely anything he wants. He can do anything if he is prepared to work hard. To sacrifice and go after his goal with a passion. He wants to be a footballer. He could be. But he will have to spend hours every day practicing when his friends are out on the town. He ‘can’ do it. But will he? I don’t know. He ‘can’ be an astronaut. He will have to work really hard at those Science subjects he’s not too keen on and do lots of extra years as a poor student when his mates are earning good money. He ‘can’ do it. Will he?
Today, after the blood draw and doctor appointment, we went for a walk. We got new chairs for the back yard, a mister that goes with you (keep you cool on the go) and a grill basket. We are excited that summer is here! My MS has been laying low, and I am loving it!

It really was a fun morning. We opened gifts, had breakfast, played with our new toys and I even learned how to knit! We always talk about the gifts we open, but we all know that the holiday is more than that. It's the gift of family and memories and joy and celebration. Toss in a little silliness and a lot of food and you have some of the best days of all. If you only get to see each other a few times a year you have to make the most of those few days.

Without unresolved action as a device, what can a picture book author do to make sure that a sequel is more than a thinly veiled rehashing of the first book? I decided to deal with this challenge by putting my protagonist in a more outrageous situation in the second book.

And there are many other means of assassination. The Soviet KGB could not assassinate Sakharov's reputation, it was above reproach. But in the modern era, with the elite media serving as the Obama regime's willing propaganda organ (birth control, anyone?) this is easier to arrange than ever. Popular media icons can be and have been driven off the airwaves by the full-court press of the Media Matters smear machine, in coordination with Valerie Jarrett at the Whitehouse War Room. And does anyone believe that the vicious smear campaign against black conservative Republican candidate Herman Caine was not orchestrated in the War Room of Gangster Government, Inc?
Whether I broke up with a man for horrible reasons, or the fact it just didn’t work, I’ve taught myself to remember that there was a reason I loved him. Just because the worst of my exes showed another more negative side I didn’t expect or vice versa, it would be a lie to all of a sudden act like I’m repulsed by their existence on the planet.
But so far my home is back in Korea, and I often think about my return. Maybe if I study more Korean I can make daily chit-chat with the folks out there. We'll see...for now I've got Florida.

This past month, Logan has continued to grow so much in the vocabulary department. In fact during our visit to Oregon this past weekend, I swear he learned 10 more words!! He regularly talks about Elmo and his favorite Sesame Street friends, and is also verbalizing his favorite foods "peas", "blues (berries)", "Cheese", "wa wa" and lets us know when he has finished by saying 'ah duh"... he also has picked up a couple other phrases such as "Happy Bees" (a favorite song in our house), and 'bye mama" and "I Of You!". And the best of all, over the past week he has begun searching for one of us saying "mama, are you?" His little voice is just so darn sweet and most of all, I LOVE LOVE LOVE how he has an ear to ear smile when he knows he is being heard and understood. It feels that all we are doing is clapping and praising.... just as it should be in raising little ones!!
And, with a sudden sense of panic, I know I have to get busy.

You’ve got to start somewhere, so follow the path of societal acceptance for depraved behavior the way the left has ALWAYS done it before: demand that they be viewed as “human just like everyone else” and demand that they be accorded rights and respect. THEN you later demand that since they’re decent, respectable people their vile behavior can’t be viewed as vile anymore. It’s been part of their playbook over and over again and it worked which is why America and Western Europe is so astonishingly morally-velocitized with behavior that was utterly unacceptable just a generation ago being openly celebrated now. So let’s “Play it again, Sam” with pedophiles.

There is a lot we know about this photo. I know I read about it in one of the volumes of letters (I'm guessing 74) and PKD talks about the event as well as this young woman at some length. Why I bet someone out there in the aether could find that information lickity split, and they would forever earn my (and all of our) respect as a serious Dick-head, because all of my volumes of letters are in my office, and I'm not. If you could just put that info right in the comments section that would be great.

Flavia was attracted to Brunel Business School owing to the excellent reputation of the Business School and the high ranking of the MBA programme. She hopes the course will help her to achieve her aspirations for the future. ‘I am thrilled about my MBA studies. Having started the programme in September 2011, I feel my horizons are already broadening and I see there are many new opportunities I can think about for my future. It seems like it will open doors to possibilities that I hadn’t considered before.”
Keaton's projectionist eventually manages to slip into this cinema dream world, inhabiting the role of the detective, fending off the sinister maneuvers of the crooks who concoct endless death traps that he flawlessly slips around, always intuiting their evil intentions before they can spring the trap. In the movies, the hero always wins, the bad guys always fail, and one senses that this young projectionist, like so many others, was first seized by his desire to be a detective while watching screen detectives much like this one. He inhabits an archetypal role, taking on a character type that had inspired him to try to shape his real life to match the movies, to become a detective like the ones on the screen — but only in dreams or the movies can such archetypes actually exist.
Back in early September of 2007, I visited New Orleans to see how the city was doing two years after Hurricane Katrina. One of the restaurants I visited was Parasol’s, an old Irish bar known for a legendary Roast Beef Po’Boy sandwich.
It is certainly the largest second-hand bookshop I have ever visited and they are constantly adding new features. There’s a room for children’s and teen books with a bookcase in the shape of a truck in the middle (with a cab you can climb into). The children’s classics (think old editions of Arthur Ransome, Angela Brazil and Anthony Buckeridge, to name but a few – some more battered than others but all of them gorgeous) are just outside the entrance to that room, alongside the classic adult fiction and crime. In the front room (with the coffee, cakes and open fire) there’s literary fiction, modern women’s fiction, historical, war-era and SF/fantasy fiction. There’s a large area for history books of various kinds with the audio books by the cashdesk. And then there’s the Big Room – row upon row of shelves of every genre you can think of (including overflow areas for some of the afore-mentioned) plus glass cases around the edge containing some of the more precious books. If you’re looking for anything from a cheap old paperback of a novel you once borrowed from a friend and would like to read again, to a first edition for a relative’s significant birthday, you can find it here. (A few years ago, for my sister’s 30th, I bought her a Twinkle annual from the year of her birth and a first edition Topsy and Tim, also published in her birth year.) The best thing about being there is that nobody cares if you just sit there lost in a book – because most of the other visitors will be doing the same! I was there with 9 members of my family today and, apart from my one-year-old niece (who was enjoying an afternoon nap), we each immediately drifted towards the section which most interested us and regrouped about an hour later clutching our various purchases! I got two suitably old-looking hardback Georgette Heyers (as a sort of post script to yesterday’s post), including one with a dust jacket in very good condition, and a much more recent Melissa Hill which was just a bit of a bargain!

On the same day as the green paper was released, the deputy minister of correctional services, Mr Ngoako Ramatlhodi, let the cat out of the bag when he said the African National Congress (ANC) had made ‘fatal concessions' at the time of the political transition (see full article here). Given the balance of forces at the time (including the collapse of the Soviet Union), it had accepted a Constitution which ‘emptied the legislature and executive of real political power' and ‘immigrated (sic) the little power left [to them] to civil society and the Judiciary'.

Cut the eggplant into large fries. The easiest way to do this is to cut the ends off the eggplant, peel it, then stand it up. Slice the eggplant length-wise into 1/2" pieces. Then lay each piece down and cut it into 1/2" strips. If you want your fries long, leave them like this. If you want them shorter, cut those strips in half.

Advertising is the means to making a great number of consumers aware of certain products. Therefore, advertising should be both attracting and appealing to consumers. If the advertising isn't appealing enough, it won't be effective. If the advertising manages to pull the attention of consumers, then it's considered to be powerful.
I like booze and I've featured that subject time and again over the decades (you can see no fewer than seven of my paintings involving sweet, sweet booze in this post about Artevino), and I expect to return to it in the near future (possibly after my next big series which is currently in pre-production).

While I am at the 2012 AWDF Championship and Team Challenge, I plan to experiment with different metering modes and see if it makes a difference. In his book, Mitchell recommends that less experienced photographers stay with evaluative mode, and I agree. Even the pros, such as Mitchell, find the evaluative mode, which is the default mode for most DSLRs, works very well. But I am curious, so check back to see the results of this experiment. If you have any experience with using different metering modes in Schutzhund or other types of photography, I would love to hear from you.

After a hearty supper, all the young people went outside to play. Since so many younger children were involved, they had to choose a simple game. The game they chose was Wolf, which caused Hannah to consider whether or not she might be too old to join in. The game involved races run at full speed in the darkness. When all of the cousins and Sam announced they would play, Hannah decided to join in. After all, Sam and she were the same age. If he could play, so could she.

one in ten Sleestaks can, in brief flashes of insight, remember the ancient secrets of their ancestors. (Roll D10 at character generation. They have this power if a 1 is rolled.) Once per session the Player can make up a detail about any dungeon environment the characters find themselves in, details may include secret doors, passwords, codes, the location of a pylon or how to operate a pylon. The DM should let the player throw their idea out there in one short sentence, but then further details are for the DM to determine. Note that ancient Sleestak technology allows for structures that are larger on the inside than the outside and other warping of time and space, so dungeon maps need not be modified except to note the location of any new Sleestak generated details. It is of course the prerogative of the DM to declare a dungeon off limits to this power because it was not built by Sleestaks or has been otherwise untouched by their weird lizardy claws.
Gladys sat in the bed with a thermometer in her mouth. Nurse Meme was in getting ready for her shift at the hospital and came in to check on her. “Temperature is normal. Is your stomach still hurting” she asked as she shook down the mercury and wiped off the cylinder with alcohol. Gladys knew that she had to play it out and replied “yes ma’am. It fills all wooshie.” Nurse Meme pulled down Gladys’ lower eye lid and looked in her eyes, and then she made Gladys breath out and in. “You know, your breathe is pretty metallic and I don’t like the look of your eyes, they are a little yellow.” Then she was gone.

This moves the ideal attack point from the forums to the mobile apps. It means that proper logging is introduced it is just as easy to see where an attack may originate, and perhaps makes the interface for doing hundreds of brute force attacks much harder, because perhaps it is harder to create a web app that simulates a mobile browser and requests the information. Maybe.

I’ve never sought out this Billy Idol song. It was on the radio in the mid-80s just as often as “Sister Christian,” and I don’t remember if I ever liked it in the first place. Though I haven’t yet seen it, the Eyes Without a Face film is much more appealing as it seems to take the possibly terrifying imagery conjured by the title more seriously. It’s a 1960 French film by Georges Franju, and you can learn more about it here.
Erie Brewing has been one that I haven't really been blown away by, mostly because their Railbender is decent enough, but I never seem to be able to get it fresh.

Pupils can use a Photo Album PowerPoint template or Ript to create digital art scrapbooks showcasing their efforts, writing little comments about their work. By the end of the session get them to decide on a favourite application and what they liked about it. So that everyone is focused on adding content to the scrapbook, add their names to the fruit machine random name generator available via Classtools – and use it to choose pupils to come up front and showcase their work – that way you can carry out some self evaluation and peer evaluation (like 2 stars and a wish) during your plenary.

All actors were undeniably good in their roles. I don’t know if they portrayed their characters spot-on based on the book, but most if not all were able to convince (and move) me with their acting. Jennifer Lawrence’s fits the role of the smart and alluring Katniss seamlessly. I could say the same for Josh Hutcherson (for Peeta), as well as the supporting cast (Woody Harrelson, Liam Hemsworth, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz and the rest). I found Lawrence and Hutcherson’s romance believable, evoking empathy during my screening when they tended their wounds or shared a kiss.

Newcomb Art Gallery of Tulane University, New Orleans, LA (as of 9-12). Erik Neil, director, reported that sources indicate the main structure is sound. There are roof leaks and offices may have had some flooding. The primary concern right now is the removal of the most vulnerable works on paper and textiles. The off-site storage facility is located in an area of extensive flooding, and all indications now are that works of art housed there were damaged by water.
When this radio preacher told of Ananias and Sapphira being struck dead he made it clear that Acts 7: 51-60 records that Stephen was stoned to death. James was about to be killed with the sword.

Most of all Jesus the Lord of glory was executed as a criminal.

Anne Shirley, of, "Anne Of Green Gables", once asked her best friend Diana something like, "What would you rather be, ravishingly beautiful or really smart?" I would rather be ravishingly beautiful. Even just for one day, to see what it is like. To have my husband come in from work and be SO impressed with me...and perhaps that day I would manage to get the house totally spotless...and have a wonderfully healthy and delicious dinner on the table. And the dog would be all bathed and fragrant and well-behaved. People would drop in and remark how clean the house is, and the teenagers would be proud. I, of course, would be feeling invigorated from my five mile run, accomplished with absolutely no flapping noises, since in this daydream, I am seriously thin. Too thin, so I must make up for it with a stack of oatmeal cookies. Okay, I went from Ravishingly Beautiful to Supermom to ridiculous.

I remember a sub-plot where a dealer is trying sell a car and how he uses his convincing powers, acting, fake calls to his bosses to sell a car. At all times he is trying to show to the buyer that he is their friend but is trying to extract as much as possible from them. How dealers make more money from service, insurance as compared to sales of the car. There is information about how the cost of each part is so important. When a company finds a problem with the test drive of car and has to come up with a solution that will cost few dollars more to cost, they go into hyper-drive as each and every dollar matters to them.

I intended to be taking it easier than this, but on the one hand, I have to admit John is rather overwhelmed by having to do so many of the chores after a full day's work, and on the other, I have been antsing to do it.

Place: Earth is a resource to be owned, valued by the price it will fetch in the marketplace, and exploited for maximum financial return. Our individual identity is defined by the brands we consume. Our individual worth is determined by the price we command in the marketplace and our accumulated financial assets. We maximize our personal economic efficiency by minimizing our individual connection and commitment to any place, person, or community and maximizing our readiness to move on when presented with greater financial opportunity elsewhere. Property rights are properly treated as individual, total, and freely tradable if the price is right.

At one point in the top of the seventh, Haslup had struck out five Spartans in a row. He was replaced by Boyden in the eighth after seven impressive scoreless innings. Boyden continued right where Haslup left off as he continued to dominate Norfolk State batter after batter.
Now, I’m not certain if the conventionality of that plot (really, when you take the basics it’s a story we all know and have seen multiple times before) is intentional for the sake of nostalgia, but it only results in the audience waiting to see what they already know is going to happen, rendering the scenes (most of them) where the expectations are confirmed often underwhelming. And whether it’s an original way to tell the story or not, I don’t think that it being neo-silent film really helps that problem.
The diary itself is one of those '5 year' jobbies, where you fill in the year manually. I think we'd been doing Samuel Pepys at school around that time, and I'd got all buzzed up on keeping a diary. I guess I dreamt of logging the final years of the seventies, as we went head-first into a brand new decade. I imagined my musings would be studied in years to come as an invaluable historical document of how people lived back then... and with a market shop down the road doing 5 year diaries for 25p (5p a year!), what could possibly go wrong?!

"I told you that, Emma, that I was going to surprise them. It was the very first thing I said!" Um, no actually, it wasn't. I would remember that because I would have said "What the feck are you thinking! That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!" Honestly! Anyway, I am pretty sure his one sister saw it, or at the very least her son said something. She called here that very night and she never, every calls us. She didn't ask and he didn't volunteer it. He was talking to the nephew on facebook the other night and he did ask William if he was coming, to which he said yes, but it was meant to be a surprise. He says he didn't tell anyone, but we are pretty sure they know!

Today is the day we are invited to, and receive, the Lord’s Supper, which is a time of the renewing of the Spirit, and the continuation of our salvation.
As the sun lowers beyond the horizon, the color spectrum of the sky changes to orange, pink and red hues. Clouds, dust or airborne particles appear back lit with vibrant colors, which casts the same color filter on anything reflective (water, shiny leaves, glass, etc). Shadows lengthen during sunset, increasing the contrast between the bright sunlight fading in the sky and non-reflective or absorbing surfaces (hills, mountains, trees, buildings, etc) creating a silhouette effect.

I was on the high way, and no one appeared to be chasing me. My hands shook as I checked my camera. It was unharmed. Then I reached inside my pocket for the tape recorder. I pulled it out. It and my hand were covered in blood. My blood. Then I felt it, the pain of child birth wouldn’t compare. I searched for where the wound was and applied pressure.
They will tell you their divine forefathers came from another realm beyond the sky, crossing the gulf between worlds in a ship of immense proportion and grand design, bringing with them the people that would populate the world, and this is accurate…though perhaps not in the way the skalds imagine.
Life is full of” stuff” today. For some of us our “stuff”is a never-ending schedules of commitments and responsibilities. Other stuff may involve job loss, financial difficulties, loss of family member, serious illness personally or within our circle of family and friends. No matter what the “stuff” may be in our lives, we have a “go-to” guy. This “go-to” guy is known as Jesus Christ. He is there 24/7 to listen to our needs.

Clarification:
So, our school system’s spring break is coming up and I decided to go somewhere. This past winter really did a number on me, and I just need to get out of Dodge. I’ve always wanted to travel across Canada by train, but I don’t have much time in April. Besides, I have a sixteen year old cat that I refuse to put in a kennel and my ex would rather stick a needle in his eye than offer to check on her. So, I decided to go somewhere for three nights. That would introduce me to solo travel. Now, you have to realize that I am also a woman in my mid-fifties, so I’m not looking to meet someone. My mom told me when I was getting a divorce that “I was too old to get a divorce and I’d never find a man.” Um, thanks, Mom. Well, not looking for a man. I just want to get re-acquainted with myself. I think I will be a lot of fun.

The bride wanted a very simple and elegant one. I had to design the text layout and sent it out to be printed and then handmake the rest of the invitation to accommodate what was being printed - invitation body, orchid square, and RSVP card. It may have been a simple invitation in appearance, but my goodness, it sure took a lot of running around. A good thing I have a friend that didn't mind driving me around. We had some fun doing it. However, after making a prototype that she loved, it was then difficult to get some of the supplies!

Characters: There's quite a few. In the main party, there's five. The protagonist, Ein and his four female companions, Fia, Lina, Serene, and Cierra. They're decent characters. A bit stereotypical and anime-like, but very likable nonetheless. Ein is a bit two dimensional and seems a bit naive some of the time, but it does help you slip into the role and make your own decisions most of the time. For plot reasons, I can't go into the antagonists too much, but they're not that bad. Definitely not stock bad guys.
And after all the excitement of Elmo, i ahd the somewhat more adult excitement of being finally able to put Flynns new " big boy " room together! The garage-to-bedroom/playroom conversion was completed by the carpet layers while we were at the Elmo show, so when we got home i got busy moving him in. Aside from a lunch and a dinner break, i literally spent 7 hrs yesterday builing flatpack furniture, setting it up, and moving all the toys and books from loungeroom and old bedroom to the new one. I have to say by 8:30pm last night was completely and utterly exhausted - methinks this pregnant lady took on too much for one day! - but it was well worth to be able to put him to sleep in his cool new room and snuggle down into my own bed to watch " Revenge " in peace!

This contest started me thinking. What am I inspired by in my life on a daily basis? The first thing that came to mind was helping people by making a difference in someone’s life. Then I dug deeper. Why is this inspiring to me? Because it is fun. It is incredibly fun to see someone smile when they see that the road is brighter or they realize they too are full of potential.

It pained me to admit it, but I missed Jack and had an irrational fear of losing him to whatever end. I didn’t want this sort of emotional chaos, but it came with the territory I had entered. Had opening myself up to let Jack in been worth the internal turmoil I felt? Was there I way to avoid that turmoil without giving Jack up? I turned to Harry Lime for an answer: “Don’t be so gloomy. After all it’s not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love – they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.”

The information processing family focuses on how we can best acquire information, organize it and explain it. A teacher seeking to sharpen students’ basic thinking skills could employ the method of concept attainment which teaches pupils to learn and use concepts and develop and test hypotheses. This method allows for the development of critical thinking skills and when focused on abstract concepts, “the strategies nurture an awareness of alternative perspectives, a sensitivity to logical reasoning in communications, and a tolerance for ambiguity (p. 75).”

A crystal maker might have distribution centers in the United States, yet still produce crystal only in its country of origin. If you are in the market to purchase new crystal stemware or add to your collection, you might want to consider contacting your nearest retailer at least a month in advance. By doing so you will save yourself the heartbreak of trying to purchase a crystal wine goblet the day of your big party and finding out that the store is out of your item of choice.

About the Illustrator:
In Queensland and New South Wales the game is king – although the ‘fans’ are fickle, the crowds parochial and small and the game run by old men with too much self interest and not nearly enough forethought – and they are very protective of their patch. In Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, Northern Territory and Tasmania the AFL rules. To the point where a parade of the Grand Final teams on the Friday before the game in Melbourne attracted over 100,000 people – that’s something like 5 times the number of fans who turned up to the NRL Preliminary final in Sydney the following night.
In my determination to change my mindset and to find joy and happiness again, I lost much. I lost myself. I lost parts of me that I had identified with for so long and parts I loved. I lost several close friends that I had before the mugging. The new me was not to their liking and even though they said they would always be there for me, when things got tough, they rather coldly and brutally walked out. My children suffered and so did my marriage. My family and friends needed to protect me and I needed them not to.
So here I am painting the very plant in the very Himalayan village Miss North painted over a century ago, and I'd like to think there's a sort of kinship in that. And thinking of her painting the whipcord cobra lily in particular makes me smile; it must have been the most amusing affront to Victorian sensibilities to behold a plant with such an overpowering eau de offal* and that unseemly, ridiculously long spadix. See her painting here.

Did Jesus go to hell? This has been a controversial question over the years, and there are many people who teach that his spirit descended into hell after his death, either to proclaim judgment to sinners or to rescue the saints of the Old Testament. There is also a heretical group that teaches that the cross wasn’t enough, so he he also had to suffer in hell for three days. I don’t have time to get into all the problems with THAT idea!

It could be painting, sculpture, digital arts or others.

I do exactly the same for every single line of action and dialogue in scripts. Briefer is better. I’m also quite particular about how my scripts look - I strive for them to be as clean and readable as possible - and so I hate ‘widows’ (a single line at the end of a sentence, containing only one word) cropping up. Widows must die. Kill your widows. Hack at that script/tweet until it says what needs to say, in as concise a manner as possible. It’s amazing how much a seemingly splendid line can be improved by boiling it down or completely rephrasing. Thinking about it, it’s probably not a terrible rule of thumb to impose 140-character limits on your script action lines.

I don't have to tell you what it was: by now I'm sure you can all see from the photos. At this point, a review would also be rather pointless since you know that I love it, but let me profess my adoration for one more paragraph. Inspired by the Garden of Ninfa in Italy, Annick Goutal's Ninfeo Mio consists of notes of Italian lemon, citron, pettigrain, bitter orange, galbanum, lentisque, fig leaf and lemon tree wood and is an olofactory interpretation of the mythic Garden of Hesperides. Given that I'd been convinced I disliked citrus and felt quite snobbish about fruit, it seems an unlikely choice - but Lord, is this a beauty. At first sharp, bracing, cool, green and bitter, it settles into a wonderfully dry, dusty but creamy warmth on the skin. A lot of the time, fig smells very much like blackcurrant to me, one of the fruits of my childhood; and beyond that, Ninfeo Mio feels like The Secret Garden out of the Frances Hodgson Burnett novel, which is one of my all-time favorite books. So there it is: an embodiment of something out of my past and something out of my dreams.
Me “Yeah…”
Finally, while there is no record of a response by government forces to Renwick’s preaching at Woolf-hole-craig’, they did respond to the Cairnhill preaching. In July 1684, the authorities do not appear to have captured have any prisoners from the Cairnhill or Cauldstane Slap preachings and did not know which minister or ministers had preached at them. It is possible that the government response produced further information on location of the preachings and the identify of the preacher. That may explain why the proclamation of 20 September recorded that Renwick was the preacher at the Woolf-hole-craig conventicle.

This lack of communication between my mouth and my brain has been with me a long time now. I’m a survivor of an all girls boarding school. So I speak from experience when I say that girls should never be cloistered in the hills of Pennsylvania, USA, with nothing but a farm and nuns; they’ll get bored. And nothing is worse than a pack of bored, adolescent girls when rules are expected to be followed. My personal favorite was smoking. This was the seventies and it didn’t make folks the pariah it does now. In fact, it was still “cool” then. Anyway, I’d promised the principal, Sr. Rose, that I’d not smoke on campus anymore. Needless to say, I was caught not two weeks later. When she asked me what had happened to my promise I replied, “I guess it went up in smoke.” Yea, I know you could probably see that one coming, but, if it makes you feel any better, I swear my left ear still hurts from her tugging on it the whole way to her office.
It’s kind of juvenile (“take that, I’m NOT going to eat that cookie, so there!”) but when we’re angry and sad, don’t we kind of regress to those primitive childlike emotions? So if I respond like a child (saying, although not directly to them, “No, you can’t make me eat a bunch of junk food! No, you can’t make me resort to alcohol just to numb the pain you caused!”) isn’t that OK? If I feel like by NOT giving in to emotional eating, I’m “winning” by being good to myself, and it helps, then I think it’s a valid thing to do.

Now I remember telling you months ago, blushing furiously, that I didn't really have any shame about watching most porn, probably because most of what I watch is pretty "normal." Hardcore, definitely, but nothing all that extreme. But there is one thing I sometimes watch but had never admitted to anyone because it just seemed, well, wrong to be excited by. "It's, um," couldn't even look you in the face when I told you, "this Japanese porn where the girl's getting sort of manhandled by a group of guys." I swallowed, cleared my throat. (Why was I even telling you this? It's not like you had to know every single one of my fantasies, after all. But for some reason I was fessing up.) "It's always public places, mostly on trains. And there are just all these hands, and a lot of groping, and kind of fingers coming from all directions and stuff." I was aware that I was getting wet, but I wasn't sure if it was the fantasies themselves or the fact that I was revealing myself to you that was making me more worked up. "And, I don't know. She pushes the guys off at first, but then she's outnumbered, she can't stop them or get away and they finger her and shove their cocks into her mouth and fuck her, right there on the train car. And she makes a show of resisting, which, you know, is part of why I find it kind of disturbing, but it's also pretty obvious that she's coming by the end, and, I don't know…they turn me on," I finished sheepishly. And you had very casually said you'd have to check them out sometime and that was the last we ever said about it.
Since I’d been tested and had a rabid reading habit of my own that allowed me to devour books in a very short time, I was very advanced for being only 5 years old. The school even said that if I’d had a better grasp of mathematics that they would have considered having me skip Kindergarten and perhaps even 1st grade because I was already reading on a 3rd grade level. But, my poor math skills kept me back and I hated the first day of Kindergarten because it was nothing but recess all day. I was there to learn, by god, and all the playing was SO boring! And I couldn’t get over the other classmates who would cry and whine and need to be restrained as their parents left each day! Didn’t they realize that this was where you could learn more and be away from your parents and be who you wanted to be?

She's always been really positive but her time in hospital really showed me just how much. No matter how much the nurses pricked and probed her with needles, got her up walking when she was weak, or woke her during the night to take blood pressure - she never once complained. Instead she thanked them, told them "I don't know how you keep going working such long hours" and that they were great!
Night of Navy Satin Ribbon
Sigh!
We have had a week let me tell you! My sweet Juliana has been sick since Tuesday with a high fever and what that Doctor first thought to be a bladder infection. When I say high fever I mean high 103 and I could not get it below 101. Thursday night she was so sick I had thought about just going to the E.R. We made it through the night and to the Doctor on Friday. She was in so much pain she would not let me touch her. As soon as the Doctor saw her he told me she needed to be admitted. The bladder infection turned to out to be a kidney infection. It is so hard when your husband is away, you have two kids in school, are planning to have a garage sale the next morning, your daughter is having friends over to spend the night and then you are told you need to take your daughter to the hospital 30 minutes away!! I do not know what I would have done without a cell phone, the ability to text and a group of friends who jumped in and helped with the kids on Friday after school. The garage sale and sleepover did not happen and my daughter was not happy about that. I think I reached my text limit with her trying to explain why the sleepover and garage sale would not happen while sitting outside the ultrasound room waiting for Juliana to come out.
Also in advance, I’m going to say: thank you, Dad, for forcing me to think through every single inclusion of a wacky gizmo or goop. I don’t want someone to be immersed in reading my book and then, poof, one completely out-of-place piece of implausible science throws them back out. Having my dad’s opinion in the back of my head has already kept me from what could have been some very obvious errors. Weird and unlikely, yes. Outright contradicting the laws of physics? No, thank you.

In his first epistle St John says, “Whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.” So whenever we reproach ourselves — for our unkindness, our short temper, our foolishness and cowardliness and laziness, for not being better parents, better spouses, better friends, better at our jobs, for not making more progress in our arts, hobbies and fields of study, for not being richer or fitter or more powerful or better-looking — John tells us that God sees all this far more clearly and extensively than we do. And that when our misfiring conscience just won’t shut up, God, who is greater than our conscience, can silence it. The question “can I forgive myself?” can be an agonizing one. But its importance, so overblown when we install ourselves as judges in a cramped hell of our own making, vanishes like mist before the rising sun when we place ourselves in the dock before the Judge of all. For He is both more severe and infinitely kinder with us than we are with ourselves.

Oh. My! This Cookies and Cream Frosting is absolutely amazing! My daughter wanted vanilla frosting on her cup cakes for her birthday party, but when I walked past a lovey package of Oreos at the store, the wheels in my head started spinning. The result of the spinning wheels in my head isn't always good. I guess I got lucky this time. :)
Peace is not just when the war is over and the armies are demobilized. Peace is the condition of being secure in one's property and person, of being able to perform one's routine activities without fear of violence. The last century and a half has allowed us to forget how rare and precious real peace is. The typical condition of mankind before the nineteenth century was to live in brutality and fear. Men had to be armed and eternally vigilant to attain peace; slaves, serfs, and women could not hope for it without the protection of a rough man ready to do violence on their behalf.
I thought I was the only one who sees the “NEW BLACK PANTHER PARTY” as nothing more than a bunch of a F.E.D.S trying to get gullible people to react violently. The Huey P. Newton Foundation (of the ORIGINAL PANTHERS) are denouncing them!!! All of these racist hate groups have agents infiltrating their organizations. The Neo Nazi skinheads are notorious for it (IE: HAL TURNER, TIM MCVEIGH & ETC). Only a sucker would fall for the oke-doke. The panthers and other REAL positive black movements were destroyed by Gay Edgar Hoover & Co-intel-pro. Even sellout blacks were used by the feds to infiltrate and destroy the movement. Don’t think for 1 second that this agenda has ended. Here’s another great article exposing the neo nazis and the new black panthers.

The twelve disciples were called the 12 apostles. Their primary job was to bear “witness to his resurrection” (Act 1:22). Jesus selected his disciples very early on so they could bear witness from the beginning of his ministry to his resurrection. When they replaced Judas, Peter laid this criteria for apostleship:
With a straight face, he handed the ticket to the man behind the counter.

And here is what I believe Barnes may have been after: a visage; a physiognomy made from symbolic decorative arts items, suggestively arranged to resemble a face. Normally this consists of candlesticks for eyes, and vessels for a mouth (and occasionally a nose and mouth). Thus, the concept of the omnipresence of art at the Barnes Foundation (or a pervasive mirror, if you will). Essentially, Barnes was creating the suggestion of a face on the very surface which a centralized viewer would be standing in front of. And the items vary according to which direction the symbolic connection is to go. For example, in Gallery 6 on the south wall, (see image above) a teapot is placed: it both formally references the reflection on the lake in the Gauguin painting above it, as well as symbolizes a carrying and possible pouring out (or divvying out) of of knowledge, wisdom -- or potency. Conversely, in Gallery 2, east wall, the central vessel (mouth, if you will) is a host box for holding the symbol of Christ's body for communion...of course, it references the painting above, a depiction of a vision of the Holy Virgin, by El Greco. But it also symbolizes the emptiness (which it is) of a soul waiting and imploring for the holiness of God to fill them - it is a vessel in waiting; in limbo; in anticipation, along with the saint seen in prayer receiving a vision.
As you prepare your home for an open house, you should make the decor as tasteful and unassuming as possible. A conservative buyer might be offended by any liberal books or items you have on display. Bear in mind that your goal is to create a more universal type of appeal. Try to make it broadly appealing, instead of narrowly focused on those just like yourself.
If your neighborhood is under the rule of terror by a gang like Flint’s Howard Boys, and you do the right thing, and kill one or two or more, you would get either life in prison or the death penalty. And if you’re white, any prison time for killing blacks equates to the death penalty. Either you’ll get gang-raped, tortured, and beaten to death, or you’ll get gang-raped, tortured, and turned into a sex slave, until you die of AIDS. Heck, if you’re white, you don’t have to have harmed a black, in order to suffer the aforementioned ends. Just being white is enough.

Will the American Christian lift his eyes from this world, from his best life now, and see a picture that spans the ages, from Adam to the anti-christ?. Lift up your eyes brothers and sisters and know that there is something unfolding. Will you cast your vote for an occultist because you are so entrenched in a system of the world? Is that how deeply entrenched the world is in your bones?

When the piano concluded and the violin took up one of Paganini’s Variations, the mood changed and the piece took off. Partnerings became compelling; patterns gained in interest and complexity; and humor was injected into the proceedings. There was a freshness and vibrancy to the dancing, particularly in the lovely lyricism of Soojin Choi. The insouciant pseudo-tutus on the ballerinas and peplum vests on the male dancers abetted the humor, reminding me of a Commedia dell’Arte cast of characters and their childlike antics.

My husband suggested he use our Melissa and Doug pattern blocks to make a mosaic. He made a 100 with the red blocks and then filled in around it with the other blocks. We helped some, but he did most of it on his own. Then my husband helped him glue it all down on a sturdy piece of cardboard. They experimented with a few types of glue and found that wood glue worked the best.

Darker burgundy comes from another berry, green from the chilka leaf and shades of brown, black and white from the hair of the alpaca and the llama. ( The vicuna also provides wool of an extremely fine quality but this animal has never been domesticated. The Incans spent much time selectively breeding alpacas to obtain an extremely fine fleece but once their Empire ended that breeding program ended. In some of the museums in Peru examples of these old textiles can be viewed. ) The weavers also use indigo for blue. Indigo is not native so it is more expensive.
Let’s just say that only HALF of those Floridians use only ONE bottle of sunscreen this year.

My favorite is the Cottonmouth, a Belgian wheat beer; it's crisp and light. My husband likes the Stumpknocker IPA (of course). But what I really want to try and haven't found yet is Wild Night, their honey cream ale.

As much as I love stouts, I'm not a huge fan of coffee stouts--that's too much of a good thing, I think.

The electricity in my area shut down in the morning and was off all day, so we huddled under blankets and I read a book. Our poor dogs were freezing outside. We had to fortify their shelters as best as we could against the wind and gave them some old carpets and blankets to burrow under. I tried to get Rita and her puppy into the laundry room but she would have none of that - she insisted on being on the front porch, where she had full view of the gate and the main entrance to the house.
They say you never forget the day you bury your first pet. I remember when you lost Libby Girl and even though she wasn’t my dog, it felt like she was. She was the best dog I’ve ever known and I was as lost without her as you were. All my favorite memories included the three of us.

One of the great miracles of life is birth and two physicians, Michael F. Roizen, MD, and Mehmet C. Oz, MD, have gotten together to write YOU Having A Baby: The Owner’s Manual to a Happy and Healthy Pregnancy ($18.00, Free Press, imprint of Simon and Schuster, softcover) that is a large compendium of information that will prepare anyone for the birth of a child. This is truly an A-to-Z treasure of information on topics that range from the biology of pregnancy to the fundamentals of child rearing. Together, they have answered most of the questions any new parent might want to ask. Parents often encounter two common ailments in their children and there’s a book to help when they do. Allergies and Asthma: What Every Parent Needs to Know, edited by Dr. Michael J. Welch ($14.95, American Academy of Pediatrics, softcover) is now in its second edition this month. Allergies and asthma often start in childhood and continue throughout life. Asthma currently affects around 6.2 million Americans under age 18. These young people often also have allergies. This book, written in easily comprehensible language, provides the latest findings on food allergies and treatments, as well as new approaches for monitoring asthma control. It’s the real deal.

I think, generally, life can be divided into cycles or phases. Simplisticly, I call them the 'up' cycle and the 'down' cycle. The 'up' cycle is basically when I feel the gods are smiling down on me. Everything fits. Everything feels great. The sun shines. The birds sing. You get the idea. The 'down' cycle is like a rainy day that never ends.
I can echo LaBeouf--there is too much unnecessary CGI. Gophers? Really, George Lucas? I actually felt saddened comparing the obvious blue screen backgrounds verses the actual sets used in the original films. I am not going to adamantly recommend The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull period, but I sorely advise you to not watch any all the previous films prior. By comparison, old fashioned art desin runs rings around CGI.

COLONIAL ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION: Up until mid-February, people were talking about the down year in the CAA. Then came Bracketbusters where the CAA once again flexed its mid-major muscle. Drexel, Virginia Commonwealth, George Mason and Old Dominion all scored big wins leading many pundits to say this is a multi-bid league again. I’m not so sure of that but I do know that Drexel and VCU will play a classic championship game. That game will be won by Drexel.

And that’s not all! It actually looks kind of really neat. I wish they had a real demo out, because it looks like it hits an amazing note of simplicity married to complexity that these sorts of games really need. It has a beautiful, clean interface (from the screens and videos I’ve seen) that just looks like a joy to observe while pretending it is a display on the deck of your command carrier. It’s unfortunately vague on a lot of gameplay specifics, because you know it’s a 4X so you… 4X things. It’s really hard to pin these sorts of games down without actually spend an hour or twenty with them, so that does make me pause. But fucking look at this:

Anyhoo – all this jabber is just to say – I am still alive and kickin – a bit uncomfortably, but the kick may be a bit harder just because it makes me fighting mad sometimes when my weeks go painfully crappy like that. But hey… what would I be without something to jabber on about?
Today was an ordinary day by mom standards. Both children were sick. The house is a bit messy. The dishes are bathing in the sink…all day. The groceries have been haphazardly shelved in the pantry. Clothes for a sale (tomorrow) yet to be tagged. The house is full of the fresh smell of spring. The driveway is gallery to masterpieces. Amid all this seemingly ordinary I thank my God for the extraordinary. Because, really none of this is ordinary. It’s all quite amazing. I have been blessed beyond what I truly expected today. I awoke to sickness spilling out from two little rooms. Coughs and sniffles making way for a day I knew would be spent at home…and the doctor’s office. We made our way through the construction and midday traffic. We popped in and out of stores to gather the elixers and tinctures sure to stifle further illness. We arrived home. Home…no word is ever quite as sweet as HOME to a weary and tired soul. The mere sight as we turn down our street makes my heart leap for the peace of my home. With the dishes and groceries and fingerprints and all the stuff left undone. It’s my undone…it belongs to my family. It is our home…where we live FULLY.

However, although John Kerry could vote for the war before he voted against it, he would never vote for parental notification for minors obtaining abortion before voting against it, and he would never vote against partial birth abortion before voting for it. To do so would be to desert the left’s most deeply held desire, the desire for abortion on demand.
This time in our lives is all about media & social networking. For some (and I will include myself here) it has become almost an addiction. For some reason, knowing what other people are doing, uploading pictures, gaming, blogging, texting, & watching youtube videos has become more important than what is currently happening in our homes, in our relationships, and even our jobs. And we are not the only ones affected by this addiction. Our children & our spouses suffer the most.
The beautiful weather continues here in Dublin, and we continue to work in the allotment as much as we can while it lasts. I never thought I’d see the day when I’d be hoping for rain, but I am.

Pessimism of the intellect is how an intelligent person colors their glasses: they see the world as it is. As studies that depressives are more likely to think critically and be self-honest, optimists live longer. False hopes keeps many people alive, literally. Yet the turn of the gleeful pessimism who makes these faults not seem like faults seems like the most perverse dialectical move: Indeed, it brings the hope to the strange place. Your negative traits aren’t negative and you are fool for seeing them as such is the the implicit ideological impulse in the gap. This move is the inverted Diogenes: the man who bites himself so his friends can ignore their wounds.
But another important thing that takes place in the community of faith is the support we offer one another in all the seasons of life. It’s not a matter of ‘giving advice’ it is a matter of helping others to listen to the Spirit as decisions and situations are wrestled with.

If you're using Windows, you can also make use of a feature called Run As. To access this, hold you mouse over the shortcut - say Internet Explorer - and hold shift as you click with the right hand side mouse button. You should see an option to Run as a different user. Click that and enter the user name and password you created earlier. Internet Explorer will now open on the same desktop as your main user, but it will be under a different account, so the favourites and history will not mix in with yours. Sadly, this doesn't work with Firefox, but other browsers might be fine.

Second, the writers are clearly going to be playing up the religious fervor often found in the South. Not in a bad way, mind you, but in a way that makes it pretty clear that a tight-knit community such as Dillon is going to have a lot of church-goers who are always putting things in God’s hands. So far the big example is Lyla Garrity who keeps stubbornly promising Jason that everything is going to be alright and this trial is all part of God’s plan in some fashion.
I have almost finished the book Born to Run. It’s great! It’s inspiring, and it makes me want to get back out there. I enjoyed the discussion of evolutionary biology leading to the concept that we were born to run distances. From an obstetrics point of view (my twisted view), I see the evolutionary biology he described in a different way. We’re the only species that can have obstructed labor, meaning we’re the only species that needs c-sections (well, except for English Bulldogs, but those are man-made). Why is that? Why would our pelvic bones be the same size, and sometimes smaller, than the heads of our offspring, leading to a high natural maternal mortality and infant mortality? Why would a baby have to twist and turn to come out? Well, it’s because we walk/run upright. It turns out that if our pelvises were any wider, then our hips would be too far apart to allow our knees to maintain stability under us. In fact, a women’s hips are already so far apart that the femur hits the tibia at an angle, putting greater stresses on our cruciate ligaments (hence why many women have torn ACLs like myself).
Certainly, the last of these doesn’t apply to me. We’ve Got a Job: The 1963 Birmingham Children’s March is my debut book. (That’s, after all, why I’ve been a member of EMU’s Debuts.) So, for these purposes, the book was birthed by a parent as nameless as a low-class Dickensian character. Nevertheless, I have a sense that this book is taking on a life of its own—so much so that zombie images have come to mind. It seems to be marching (appropriately) into newspapers, blogs, emails, stores, and conversations, without my presenting it to society accompanied by a proper introduction, as would be expected of an upper-class Dickensian character.

Thursday–On Thursdays I read emails and Twitter posts from our local farmers markets and farmers so I know what will be available over the weekend. These posts help so much. I highly recommend getting on the e-mail lists of any farmers markets or farmers near you.

I start making my draft menu for the next week at this point.

As Kyle forges his way home, his frightened family faces their own struggles for survival in a community trying to halt its slow spiral into chaos and anarchy.

I've even seen one in a Southwest terminal at the Kansas City airport, being sold right next to cans of Tallgrass Buffalo Sweat. Either there are a lot more people drinking Redhook than I thought, or they just have some very aggressive sales reps that have scored accounts all over the place.
As I look more and more into “alternative” families I do wonder sometimes about the displacement of the dad. For example, I know a guy who is the father to a baby for two lesbians. He’s a straight guy and the one lesbian was his best friend, so he donated his man-stuff for her. The kid knows him, but he is definitely known as more of a “Super Uncle”. He’s Super Uncle Jim. Since Jim is a poet and has an unstable living situation, this is a great arrangement for him. He sees the kid when he wants and gets to be a dad – on the side. But, what about the gay men who do NOT want to be dads on the side? Sure they can adopt or have their own kids via a surrogate, but I think a lot of times they get left out of the “alternative” family building process because chicks still own their uteruses – even though the government often thinks THEY own them, but that’s a subject for another post by another blogger.
That’s when I thought nothing is as it seems.No tomorrow can be predicted accurately .We can just plan,hope,wish or pray for things but then there is a higher power in action who makes everyday different for every person so that he/she can learn ,grow and live to be a better person.

Before I get started: I've talked before about hiring your own publicist, and as usual, Jessica over at BookEnds has written an excellent post on the subject. In short: a good publicist can work wonders when you do everything right, but they're by no means necessary and are often an extraneous expense. Make sure you know what you're getting into beforehand. As always, talk to your agent.
So I of course, I asked my 6 year old son and his answer was 'Yummy Chocie Eggs'!!!!!
The last boss to have the kind of CV that the Capello’s and Mourinho’s of this world have was the late, great Sir Bobby Robson.
The grump continued all through the rest of bathtime and the rest of the evening routine. Cuddles and make-up before sleep time though (thank goodness for Melatonin).
It has an odd, hollow, cardboard bitterness that I notice more than anything right up front, which makes it taste like a stronger golden ale. Like adjuncts. Cheap. It fades quickly to an alcohol bite, and all of that malt disappears quickly. The bitter harshness just isn't right for the type.
Each bound student is positioned at the pool's edge. Each naked girl, indelibly marked on every blemish. Nipples circled with felt pen and comments on their size, appearance and firmness written in comic balloons on their skin. Something vibrating and uncomfortable between their legs, forced too hard. The violation makes each squirm and Corina, scream a silent scream. The perpetrator's zealotry hurting her vagina with painful thrusts of what feels like the end of a wooden spoon. Her sobs muted by the tape and the laughter and encouragement of existing sorority members.

We started using our green push broom to defend ourselves because it happened to be nearby. But lately we've learned that nothing else can successfully keep Chanticleer at bay.
It's not like the place is completely unknown. Geno and Cindy Acevedo started the place in March of 1994, so it's been around a while. And they've won a few awards, including two Great American Beer Festival medals, so other people have come to realize how good their beer is. But for this months session, I decided that my favorite Bay Area brewery was that deserved its day in the media sun. Yes, I know, we're supposed to write about one beer for this session instead of a whole brewery. Well, just take your pick from one of my favorite El Toro beers described below.

Came February 17th , our Finance Minister should have a big sigh. He is now relieved and had placed the budget to the House. With the hectic election last year, he managed to get the budget into the table. Now his job is done. He can now concentrate to do the following year budget. To me, it is just another piece of work of the enlightened one.
One of the things that makes track and field exciting is great head to head competition. Nowhere are the head to head battles any bigger than at the World Championships and Berlin will have its fair share. With four weeks to go before the Opening ceremony, I will be taking a look at several of these match ups, starting with the men's 400 and Jeremy Wariner and Lashawn Merritt.

Theist: Wait wait my friend…as you are describing your illustrious ancestors tell me how they managed to not be brutally killed by all the wild beasts? You know like bobcats and snakes? Oh yeah I forgot they were the wild beasts. But how is that these wild beastly smelly creatures evolved into men and other wild beasts such as bears lions tigers..you know animals of that sort did not evolve into humans? What determined that? Also why is evolution so unmercifully involved? In the Bible it is so simple and to the point, so lovely. It says that God created man in his image. I love it!

Above all, you must live as citizens of heaven, conducting yourselves in a manner worthy of the Good News about Christ. Then, whether I come and see you again or only hear about you, I will know that you are standing together with one spirit and one purpose, fighting together for the faith, which is the Good News. Don’t be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself.
Mr. Coenie Pitout (35), Father of 2 little girls was shot 4 times by 3 intruders who broke into the family's home. Mr. Pitout's wife woke him up when she heard noises. Wrongly assuming his wife had heard the children he did not take any weapon with him. On entering the kitchen he was shot in the left cheek at close range by one of three intruders who confronted him. He put up a fight and was stabbed and shot a second time. The report then states that he managed to free his one daughter from one of the attackers so both girls could get to their Mother in the bedroom which has somewhat sinister implications. The mother then broke a window and fled to the neighbours.
Do not our hearts long for this? Even when our minds rebel and scream and shout and rage against all that is right and good and pure and holy do we not know love? Are we are not all desirous of love? In the end, Paul said, all that really matters is love because all that remains is love.

We just want to thank everyone that came by our booth last weekend. As always, we met lots of sweet people and had wonderful "neighbors" in the booths around us. We just had one small booth this time. Since it is spring, we haven't had long in the garage sale season to find a lot of new pieces. But, we are already planning a couple of new things for fall that we are excited about. Something other than the flea market.
Today whatever pandemonium we seen in Pakistan is due to Indians and CIA in Afghanistan. Enemy’s jugular passes through Pakistan and today when we have got hold of that jugular and have stopped their supplies, what has America been able to do in retaliation? What can they do to Pakistan? They are dying in Afghanistan and cannot do anything about it. Their economy at home has collapsed. Soviet Union did not get the biggest defeat in the battlefield, but they suffered so much losses due to war that they were unable to sustain themselves. Same is happening to America now. By stopping the supply lines, Pakistan has multiplied their losses.

Despite the likely presence of an R18 in Florida during March, Audi has ruled out any possibility of a Sebring debut for its latest LMP. Electing to participate regardless, the team will utilise a modified version of its current R15+ chassis for the 12 hour event.
Which it is funny. This method goes back to “The Frame” method I had talked about in another post long ago. I had thought I’d discarded it in favor for some other methods, but now it looks like I’m going back to it. To a degree.
So, that's what I spontaneously wrote a few months ago for no particular reason. Then, it occurred to me that I would be speaking here to you fine folks, and I had better give a little thought to what I wanted to, you know, talk about. I knew that I wanted to talk about relationships, since that's a big area of interest for me. But, every time I'd sit down to write about relationships, I'd get a little hung up. Then, the light bulb went on over my head and I realized that it would be disingenuous of me to talk with authority about anything other than -- me. I realized that until I could speak my story, I probably would not be able to access the other stuff I had to say. So, here's how things started for us.

They walk right in. My mind is screaming to demand to see the warrant, when I am told, "Mr. Bennett, we don't want any trouble, and I don't want to frighten your children." He's a little late for that. He ignores my request about the warrant, and proceeds to find and arrest Michael Anderson. I stand in my living room and watch the agents running around here to there. I look at one who is holding his rifle next to a car. He looks at me for a second, then moves behind the car and continues to watch. I look at my 6-year-old twin girls; they are scared to death. I hold my hands out far from my sides for "them" to see.

When banning fever takes hold, it can be hard to stop: the repressive impulse gathers momentum and settles into habit. “Other words will be addressed once we get rid of awesome,” the campaigner promises, ominously.
It was annoying because of the nature of the marketing: no one likes to feel as if they're being played. Still, it was mildly intriguing as well as irritating.

A young man met us outside to let us into the complex which needed remote-key entry. My co-worker said he had once looked into getting an apartmet in this very building. The client, we’ll call him Jeff, was not much older than me. I’m going to guess around 32 or so. He showed us into his unit. A classy loft-style apartment with a large brick wall inside, modern kitchen, clean bathroom and two bedrooms. It was soon to become his former residence. He looked around at his stuff and told us he needed to get rid of the couch, coffee table, queen matress and bed frame, a fully equipped and functioning stereo system and a small dresser.
Have a nice day.

The dilemma here is Stefan's: Can he bring himself to condemn William to "eternal night" (whatever the hell that is) to end his own suffering. You might actually want to lead with this because it makes Stefan MUCH more sympathetic than he seems at the start right now.
I am more than happy to tell you that I was wrong. These pancakes are moist, full of the spicy taste of cinnamon and the sweet, creamy goodness of the cream cheese frosting, and they taste exactly like a cinnamon roll.

This year, Ryan and I have seen God do so much in our personal walks with Him as well as with our family as a whole. It's been a big year of learning how to be good stewards of the money He has given to us and really learning the truth that it is ALL God's. Even though we've been brought "low" this year, He has still richly rewarded and blessed us with fun activities, vacations and our "daily bread" - giving us all that we need =)

In Going Postal, Terry Pratchett makes memorable the name of antihero Moist von Lipwig, which takes some doing. As a skilled conman Moist is a master at offering others the “prospect of hope”, but it seems rather unfair when all his efforts to escape Ankh-Morpork and its patrician Lord Vetinari start becoming only prospects of freedom. From being hanged in the morning to being forced to accept a government job in the afternoon would be enough to drive anyone mad. Add in a golem for a parole officer, a decrepit Post Office building complete with fanatic tenants for a home, and a cynical Miss Dearheart for a love interest, and Moist’s new career seems hopeless. Fortunately, the discovery that mysterious forces killed the previous four postmasters died suspiciously, and that the head of the rival communications giant of clacks, or telegrams, has a brutal business agenda convinces Moist that he must rise to the occasion. At least it all comes with a hat.

I am now on the second section of the book which goes on to describe other worlds - what would it be like to be on a planet that orbits a binary star, for instance, with constantly changing lengths of day and night, and orbits that rotate one way and then the next. And what would it take to destroy a planet like the Time Lord's Galifrey (the answer is an extremely large bomb of antimatter).

The scream hung in the air like the waxing moon outside my window. I touched my face, expecting to feel the wound there, my skin cut somehow as Myrddin’s had been in the dream. My trembling fingers came away clean. My heart raced as my mind recovered, but I tore from my bedchamber nonetheless, darting through the shadowed hallways of Grandfather’s household, avoiding the guards that stood, dozing, at the ends of corridors. I knew I’d be beaten if I was caught, but nothing was as important as getting to Myrddin.

Amy and Roger's Epic Detour is an amazing road trip. Really. They take turns picking destinations, and make all kinds of discoveries along the way: discoveries about America, and about themselves. From the Loneliest Road in America to the deliciousness of Chick-fil-A, Amy and Roger are taking each mile of the trip as it comes, never knowing what awaits them. As Amy gradually adjusts to being around people again, she starts realizing that things can't stay bottled inside forever. She and Roger make a true connection, and he helps her gently but steadily break down the walls she put up and deal with the raw emotion she's kept hidden so long. This isn't all Amy's story however, and Roger learns to see past his own mistakes and look more clearly at life. In finding the best eats and chasing down windmills (a`la Don Quixote), Amy and Roger's epic detour becomes a literal journey to new life.

The problem should be obvious: It would take years to watch all of this, maybe a lifetime. When I was a young man, I didn’t have a lot of money, but was really excited about this new-fangled DVD thing. I bought a significant number of DVDs, but watched most of them within a few days of purchase. After a while of this, I found myself working a block from a used CD/DVD store and pulling in lots of overtime. They had an ongoing special where if you bought three items of the same price, the fourth would be $2.50. I didn’t want to pay more than was optimal, so I always bought in groups of four. They could keep lists of movies I wanted and call me when they go them in, so I had reason to make frequent trips and DVD Profiler kept track of everything I wanted so I could be sure to give them a thorough list. It was pretty common for me to walk in there and buy sixteen or so movies. Sometimes, I’d buy eight or so seasons of TV material. Since I was working about seventy hours a week, I would maybe get around to watching one or two of these. It didn’t take long before I owned more DVDs that I hadn’t watched than had. I made numerous efforts to cut back, but then would see an amazing deal and buy a few dozen movies that I didn’t have time to watch.

If anything, there is a lot to be learned on the long tail from the growth of mobile phones (cell phones), and importantly, we have a much longer timeframe graph to compare the growth of the mobile phone to the growth of the ebook. Market saturation is not something you are going to hear for a long time with ebook devices, but the day will come, because the history of Apple and Microsoft in the computer operating system war will tell you a thing or two about controlling content. For so long, Microsoft believed controlling the device made you king, but in the long tail Apple showed that content was king with their 'app' for anything drive.

I wrote about this trend for The New York Times last year — after two publications did their level best to screw me out of almost $7,000 I’d earned. One owed me $5,600 and sent me emails telling me of their financial troubles. Like I care. If I can run my business efficiently, so can you. I found a contingency lawyer, sued and won half (the lawyer, sad to say, took a third of that.) I hired another lawyer — a softball buddy who helped out for two bottles of Stoli — whose letter to the other deadbeat produced payment within two days of his letter, after months of nyah-nyahing and stonewalling.
The surviving Night Elves converted to Druidism, and any practice of Arcane magic was forbidden. But the Highborne were still addicted to magic far deeper than those Night Elves who had lived further from the influence of the Well, and they spent much of their time seeking out new sources. Eventually, the leader of the Highborne confronted Malfurion and the Druids, declaring them cowards for their shunning of Arcane magic.

First it seems she thinks that the only reason people would choose to show the military in a positive light is because they’re being paid to…and not because, well, they live in reality. I don’t know about the rest of you, but I wanted to be in the military, I couldn’t pass the physicals, but I wanted to be in the military and admire to no end those who did what I could not. And I simply cannot understand the mindset of someone who does not find it honorable that someone chooses to put their life on the line to defend the rights of another. And then she simply equates the military with violence. Actually, idiot, the military is what protects us from violence, but I shouldn’t expect intelligence like that from a liberal. Quite frankly Wolf’s outlook is just a little sick and perverted and just a bit dishonorable.

This 1931 song gives a hint of the spell cast by Bing Crosby, Russ Columbo and Rudy Vallee when they performed at the Brooklyn Paramount Theatre, one of the major stages where these legendary troubadours pioneered the art of popular singing and minted the template for the musical idol, which has become a mainstay of our popular culture.

Acting wise the movie is just superb. Out of the three main actors it’s Keira Knightley that really steals the show as Sabina Spielrein, the woman that caused the fracture between Jung and Freud. I can see many actresses just over playing the role as the role does lend itself to the insanity. Yet while she does have her wild moments there are touches of the subtle woven throughout. Looking back on how she played some of the scenes, there is such a genius in every movement. Fassbender as Carl Jung is also excellent as the young psychologist trying to flesh out his ideas and most importantly figure out the best way to help people. Viggo Mortensen as Sigmun Freud rounds out the awesome trio. I think he’s the weakest of the three but only because he’s not given as much time to develop as a character. Still Viggo grabs onto the role and throttles as much as he can out of it.
The highlight for me, though, was the soundtrack. It featured some truly stellar protest folk songs, which sadly I have not yet located for purchase. There was a bizarrely beautiful scene where a guitar-strumming troubadour leads a group of youths to safety, Pied Piper-style, that I had to rewind and watch again.

Packages must look appealing on the shelf; websites and blogs have more stickiness if they feature rich imagery and video. We are visual creatures. “Intense and prominent cues (those that are louder, more colorful, bigger, brighter, etc.) increase the probability of attracting attention,” Terence A. Shimp writes in his Advertising, Promotion and Other Aspects of Integrated Marketing Communications. In online dating, pictures matter more than one’s love of animals, time spent in the Peace Corps, or triathlon training in a profile description. OKcupid.com even did a study of what picture types work and what’s better left for your mom.

Five of our group came out for the intervals and we decided on a warm-up lap followed by 3 minutes hard running/3 minutes aggressive walking that we would repeat six times.

We all stayed together during the warm-up lap and when the lap was over, I hit my lap button and yelled “Run!” and we were off!

Now in the land of online news, people are not called upon to write multi-paragraph essays to demonstrate their understanding of articles. But people feel compelled to write comments on material they read and/or engage in dialogue around it, and I do enjoy this democratic freedom. What is painful to me — when I feel interested enough in an article to read some of the commentary — is the seemingly poor reading comprehension of the readers. So many comments (especially the hyper-critical or extremely favorable ones) don’t seem to reflect what is actually written.
One of my goals in 2009 is to try at least 1 new recipe a week. I have so many wonderful, healthy, lowfat/low-cal cookbooks, and I’m looking forward to trying out a bunch of new meals.
We had our original folky skeleton designs professionally printed
A central question of both the exhibition and the super-workshop will be how future tools of landscape investigation—new spatial devices on a variety of scales, from the inhabitable to the portable—can be imagined, designed, and fabricated. These include objects, models, prototypes, graphics, and speculative proposals, ranging from the physical to the digital, from the geological to the conceptual, from the felt to the heard, and from deep-time to the hand-made.
Food! Don't worry, I won't forget the food. The food is what brought this blog out of me. I love writing and sometimes wish I had the time to do more of it, but this blog has allowed me to bring together my love of creating healthy, good food for my family and friends and write about it. How wonderful is that? I know I need to get back to some food posts - I really haven't forgotten that is the reason I'm here!
And instead of walking out with one item (which was my plan... I NEVER take them all in to get more than three things unless they are confined to a cart... for that seems to be our chaos threshold), we walked out with SIX individual items. And to be honest, we probably could have been good for a few more.

Many of the rites of "witchcraft" in the middle ages were no different of the ritual sex and sacred marriage of the fertility cults of the old and new testaments. With focus on goddess worship, human fertility, earth fertility, the use of herbal potions, and yielding to supernatural powers via sexual orgies or ecstatic intoxication with alcohol and drugs. In fact the notion of witches being able to fly came from such drug induced delusions.
We then ordered a chinese and brought in the new year pigging out :)
The conference bridge automatically sends me an email at the end of every conference call across the company, listing the total minutes, the number of participants and the number they called in from. So when I got this e-mail…I had to stare at it for a minute:
I cleaned up the original pulls with white vinegar and table salt, my go-to metal cleaner/polisher.

I hated throwing it down the drain so I froze every last ounce of that liquid gold. By the time my son was 6 months old I had filled my entire freezer!! I did not want it to go bad so I starting calling around to the hospitals and other organizations to find out if I could donate it. In the process of making calls I found out there was this gal on the other side of town that was getting ready to bring her first baby home from Korea. A beautiful 5 month old baby girl with unrepaired cleft lip and palette.

I realised at the last minute that I had loads of dye salt but no dye fix. A quick look on the interweb told me I could use washing soda (nope haven’t got any of that) or sodium carbonate, AKA soda ash (nope, haven’t got any of… wait a minute!) Soda ash is commonly used in glazes, and what do I have a workshop full of? That’s right, glaze ingredients. Woo! I found some and fixed my dye. It worked perfectly, and was probably cheaper than the Dylon stuff.

Coincidentally, among the "core cities" with the whitest populations, Portland is first at 74% and Pittsburgh is second at 67%. In contrast, Pittsburgh's Robber Baron-era rival Cleveland is only 37% white. But that doesn't have anything to do with why Pittsburgh is slowly becoming hip while Cleveland is stagnating. Don't even think that.
But he was asked if the NotW paid “corrupt” police officers. Therefore he could say that the NotW did not pay “corrupt” officers, but instead paid honest ones. As the wise blogger and Twitterer @loveandgarbage pointed out, the Prevention of Corruption legislation makes payments like this illegal both by the donor and the recipient. However, if Mr Coulson believed these were legitimate payments, tied in perhaps with the “crime fighting” role of the NotW, then the fact that, in law, recipients of the payments were ipso facto “corrupt” would not be enough, in my view, to establish perjury. Ignorance of the law cannot make a statement false where the person believes it to be true.

Urging the PM to advise the Yang di Pertuan Agong to form a tribunal immediately, Mat Zain said Najib should do it before he goes on his impending vacation – if he felt deceiving the Agong and Conference of Rulers was a serious matter.
God gives enough time for conviction and knows when the time is right. It took those who demanded the death of Christ 40 days to be ready for the day of Pentecost. Then at Pentecost when the twelve apostles preached, many were ready to receive and in Acts 2:41, “there were added unto them about three thousand souls.”

In terms of decision processes and style, Jobs was famous for being a tough micro-manager, at least where product design decisions are concerned. As a Fortune magazine article on Apple’s culture put it: “He’s a corporate dictator who makes every critical decision—and oodles of seemingly noncritical calls too, from the design of the shuttle buses that ferry employees to and from San Francisco to what food will be served in the cafeteria.”
Could I ever have something so complex?
Finally, a workshop on Troilo. Joaquin objects to the idea of learning to dance 'to Troilo', 'to D'Arienzo', 'to Di Sarli': 'Which D'Arienzo?' he asks. Each orquesta sounded different at different periods, and they all sound remarkably similar to each other at any one period. He plays a track from 1942 and asks us which orquesta it is. We'd been listening to Troilo and just danced a track of Di Sarli: it could well be Di Sarli. But it's D'Arienzo.
Very strange. I just tried calling the store's telephone number, but it has been disconnected.
Okay, so. I’m reading a lot about how Dynasty Young‘s mom shouldn’t have sent him to school with a taser, generally because two wrongs don’t make a right yada yada self-defense perpetuates the cycle of violence blah blah I am a privileged piece of shit who can count on people to sympathize with my problems and either protect or avenge me should things really get messy etcetera etcetera some Just World Fallacy in there as well because if Dynasty got expelled then he and his family definitely did something wrong here or it wouldn’t have happened.

In 2003, I spoke with Justice Falerdeau, and with the two lawyers involved in this case. It was clear that Justice Falerdeau's decision was based on the evidence before him. It was not even considered that having an autistic child was anything less than devastating. It was not even considered that Charles-Antoine was anything but the burden described by the President of Montreal's autism society. Everyone saw Charles-Antoine as a burden. No one questioned this. And in the media, Ms Lahaie implied that he was better off dead--happy, to be murdered.
* Release poisonous/toxic self-talk. Do you find yourself repeatedly defining yourself in limiting ways? Do you find yourself being overly critical and judgmental of your actions and your overall state of being? What we consistently tell ourselves about ourselves becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. It’s wise to be very aware and discerning of what we believe we are capable of. We make this our truth. Why not create a new story that reflects the beauty, purity and worthiness of our spirit? We have that daily option. We deserve this. Each of us can begin right now. We can shift those old, limiting stories into bright, expansive stories that honor our spirit and allow for the success that is ever-present and always awaits us.

A few weeks ago Erin from Blogexpats asked me to write out an interview in either German or English for their special online edition of how expats live overseas. Since I couldn’t decide which language to choose, I simply answered the questions in both German and English.

A couple of days after the reception at the farm I started getting hoarse, having a hard time breathing and a hard time swallowing. This has gotten progressively worse for the last month.

But return he did, starting for the first time since September, coming out of nowhere he slotted into a front four comprising of Nasri, Silva and Aguero whose interplay, pass completion and shots on goal as a unit also…well…came out of nowhere. No longer ‘carrying the team’, Tevez scored a goal, followed by a humble celebration and didn’t complain about taken off. Change.
Conclusion: Sarah and Todd were both photoshopped into the picture from two separate photos and whoever did it, made an awful job of trying to get the perspective right.
The last time I went in, the member of staff again apologised, explained that she was there for the foreseeable future as they had had a lot of complaints about the store. I told her this was the last time I'd be coming into store - if I didn't get it this time I'd be informing trading standards and expect the contract cancelled immediately. A shame because Orange have actually been very helpful each time I've had to call them. A couple of clicks on the computer and the form I needed was printed out. I was speechless. All the time I'd wasted, driving in monthly to be lied to when they could have printed out the form instantly. I signed the form in front of her, went home, got the first bill and sent it off.

This is what happens when temporary politicians make laws that restrict our freedom. Thank God the Supreme Court got it right. And this drives the Left nuts. These folks want it okay for Union thugs to have their say but not those evil corporations ( in the Left’s eyes). Yet it is those evil corporations (in the Left’s eyes) that pay the freight for their campaigns and expensive lifestyles.

According to the arrest report, Van Wagner told police he was acting on a “fetish” and that he had been doing it for years in various locations. Police noted they had a similar incident reported at Sportsman’s Park Wednesday.

I finally have a place for my step stool! It's been floating around from place to place, but I think I will keep it here from now on. I got the idea from visiting little raindrops blog. I was going to put some shelf liner on the bottom, but forgot until after I was all done. I may still do it later.
The conflicting messages that come out of the ANC these days bring that inescapable impression of internal chaos and warring groups that manoeuvre behind the scenes, organising and re-organising, ready to pounce.
Are these “special provisions” for women or just outright discrimination against men? How can the court come to the conclusion that the, marriage has broken down, yet deny the same relief to him, that in the other way around, the courts would have readily handed it to the woman?
Add some mint for a fresh burst of flavor.
For me, the principles of thriller-writing are the same whoever you're writing for! Personally I think that the story is 'king' and if you keep your focus on making sure everything you write serves the core story then all the rest follows on from there. My editor totally gets the way I write and is very open to my ideas. She offers brilliant advice and comments on the first draft of the work I send her. I'd say I probably take on board about 90 per cent of her suggestions.

It is a fact, which no one will deny, that the crime of rape was substantially unknown during the period of slavery, and was hardly known during the first years of freedom: it is the fatal product of new conditions. Twenty-five years ago women in the South went unattended, with no more fear of attack than they have in New England. To-day, no woman in the South goes alone upon the highway out of sight of white men, except on necessity, and no man leaves his women alone in his house if he can help it. Over 500 white women and children have been assaulted in the South by Negroes within that time. (T.N. Page, 1904)

So my neighbor, the one who talks a lot, stops me to say he is sorry. So I just listened. He proceeded to say that the other day he was walking to the lawn man about his dog and how she is over weight and need some exercise. He thought I over heard that and thought he was talking to me. After he was finished telling his story I told him I had not heard any of that. Wow…. people pfft…

Hard to believe it's been a month since our last post. Xiao Ya is gaining weight, height and words like mad. The fine folks at the cardiology department of Children's National Medical Center gave her the closest thing to a clean bill of health that such a specialty can offer -- asking to see her just once a year and suggesting she can run marathons if she'd like.
Speaking of which, Michael Biehn brings his great, natural humanity to Corporal Hicks. He shows the character to be a natural leader with confidence, decisiveness, and intelligence. Hicks is definitely the guy that will have your back all the way. Just as he was in The Terminator, Biehn shines through as a wonderfully dynamic and emotionally powerful actor. His warmth and chemistry with Sigourney strikes the right, soft chord. They work extremely well together with a mutual respect that penetrates through the screen. I’m not sure that the original casting choice of James Remar would’ve embodied those qualities so strongly or naturally. Michael Biehn was an amazing, fortunate happenstance in this instance.
"If she had a warning label, it would read: “Good friend, not great. Talks more than listens. May or may not have a conscience. Manipulative in an emergency. Needs constant attention. May or may not be capable of authentic connections. Should not be exposed to displays of sickness, grief, shame. May contain traces of fraudulence." In the second story, "Love Seat" was one I had difficulty to connecting to; it's a sort of twisted love story involving the Grateful Dead and a lot of tanning lotion and a radio show host. I actually enjoyed the beginning, before it got into all the Grateful Dead stuff, since I've never listened to the band and all the connections and symbols just didn't make sense to me. It might work better for an older, or more musically literate, reader.

The nature of the problem is made clear by the first five points above, and the moral nature of a robust response to Islamization the sixth. Islam is a totalitarian political ideology, impossible to reform on any useful timescale, impossible to supplant once deeply embedded, demographically destined to become ever more threatening, from which we cannot simply separate, and which we owe no consideration. What would a Europe that had succeeded in defending itself against this cancer look like?
When we look for candidates to the priesthood and as we pray for vocations, we are looking for men who are brave in their willingness to seek holiness, to speak the truth, to lay down their lives. There is no place in the priesthood today for “wimpish-ness.” There is no place for an attitude that just wants to please people, no matter what they think and no matter what they want. Today the priest has to stand up and be brave, preaching the Truth with love. He has to be willing to be unpopular. And if it comes to it, he has to be open to martyrdom.
In a recent opinion, two federal appeals court judges suggested that all efforts to protect workers, consumers or the environment were unconstitutional, including regulatory efforts by the states. It’s a radical view, but one that has gotten increasing traction in conservative legal circles. It is also the culmination of years of institutional investments by the corporate Right to advance what’s come to be known as the “law and economics” movement, which analyzes legal rulings “costs” – essentially applying neoliberal economic logic to the field. Its advocates eschew the notion that human rights or economic fairness are inherently valuable factors for the law to consider.

Superman appeared most regularly on sports pages. While Jack Dempsy insisted that “It will take a superman to beat” boxer Tom Heeney, football stars Red Grange and Frank Johavac were both declared “Superman.” Babe Ruth was a “Baseball Superman,” as was Giants pitcher Red Ruffing, and golfer Cecil Leitch was a “superwoman of the links.”

Don't get me wrong, there's lots of booze to choose from--50ish beers and even more wines--but if you rule out the stuff you can find at your local grocery store, it's not jaw-dropping. So my first impression, after parking ourselves at a small two-top in the appropriately noisy bar area some 90 minutes earlier than our projected seating time, was to be slightly underwhelmed at the pub element.

As you know Darby has dyslexia. His eyes aren't quite as fit as the rest of this body which means he has trouble reading. He is currently in Year 3 and reading at a Year 1 level. The interesting thing is he loves the reading experience. He is quite good with his comprehension, fantastic with facts, ability to predict, character assessment, creating stories of his own and the like. He just can't read easily. He also understands many of the rules of punctuation, he can spell out loud, he has a huge vocabulary and is very articulate with his words. He just can't write easily. Dyslexia is like that.
OH! And yesterday I took a day trip to Pennsylvania with a group from church. Dennis took the day off and stayed with his mom.

We had lunch at an Amish Inn... the food of course was excellent... and of course I ate too much! But I let myself do these things on occasion and just accept a little gain should it happen.

After letting go, I grew to really love the cast, especially all the magnificent circus folk and their wonderful wardrobes and tricks. New characters were brought in for each episode and they were great! The acting and writing was delightful. A big world unfolded and threads were left hanging to bring back characters after they left.. more and more threads came together, the show got even crazier and more ridiculous... and then CUT! The end.
What new books have you snatched lately?
Before beginning this review, several disclaimers:
"Nursery Rhyme of Innocence & Experience" by Natalie Merchant - Epic lullabye in which Merchant takes a bittersweet poem by Charles Causley and gives it a gorgeous score. This song inspired a story I've been kicking around lately.

My little sister. She didn't hop on a plane. She hopped in her car with her husband and a six month old. In addition to dinner and laundry, she and her husband D fenced and planted my garden. She did dishes. He rigged the feeder in my chicken coop to go up and down so the mice wouldn't eat all the chicken feed. He entertained their little one (translate: he drove around a lot) so Laura could sit in the NICU with me. That was most important.
She’d needed to know that it’s OK to feel. And sometimes, you just have to break the rules, and do what you know you should.

If I have to choose one of the 7 that Joyce has listed, I would choose an all-day movie marathon, but if I could choose whatever I wanted to do on a rainy day, I suspect that I’d choose quilting, but then again I’d probably put on some of my favorite movies to “watch” while quilting … so maybe I am going with one of Joyce’s choices after all.
This morning, however, for some strange reason, the class just fell apart. There was a sense of rhythm being lost: of neat and tidy dance co-ordination giving way to fluttery chaos.

“The drive of the Rockefellers and their allies is to create a one-world government combining super capitalism and Communism under the same tent, all under their control…. Do I mean conspiracy? Yes I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.”- Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 1976, killed in the Korean Airlines 747 that was shot down by the Soviets
The 5th episode of the series was surprising. The story of Rin begins to unfold, I don’t see her as a secret anymore, even though there are some sides of her I am not aware of. She graduates from kindergarten and Daikichi meets her mother(which I find very naive and unprepared for this world, really. she seems like one of these people with their heads in the clouds). Finally, I must say, as I’ve been waiting to meet Rin’s mother for a long time. Although the story of Rin is quite tragic, the creators manage to keep it light and cute, which is my favourite thing about Usagi Drop.
Celebrants drank more beer than was probably wise, pulled out their barbecues in the parking lot, and sunbathed on their lawn chairs as though on a seaside holiday. There were costumes, bedlam, and nonsense. People skied in grass skirts, bikinis, sequins, and outrageous outfits of all hues. The atmosphere was raucous ebullience with a hedonistic flair. So, of course, we couldn't stay away!
We walked today, my son strapped to my front looking at the world with fresh eyes and me having a big think. As we passed by the infamous taxi stand where two sets of people stole a cab from me while I was in labor in the middle of a snowstorm, I got enraged all over again and thought that most of all, I will not miss the lack of community in this area and the general frosty and negative attitude. BUT....I WILL miss walking a block to the Seine river, the beauty of my surroundings, my boucher and cheeseman but most of all, my dearly beloved and worshipped Eric Kayser bakery, also known as the best bakery in the entire universe and beyond. It's currently donut season there so I ate 12 of them yesterday in honor of my departure....
For years, I've been lamenting society's trend toward "hotness." In days gone by, women were pretty and elegant...sexy even...without having to dress sluttishy in the process. A woman's attractiveness and sex appeal came from other things than being nearly completely exposed, and I believe that as we women have taken to dressing so provocatively, we have become little more than sex objects. So, as for me, I'll take "pretty" over "hot" ANY day of the week!!
When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hands, he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the LORD. When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, his face was radiant, and they were afraid to come near him.

One morning I got up and was really spending some time praying about these issues. Was this really what God was asking us to do? Did He really want us to be foster parents here, now? In my reading and praying, I felt an overwhelming sense of confirmation that this was exactly what we were supposed to do! We were ready, God had put us in this place for just this thing, and we should move forward without hesitation. I finished my devotions and went to take a shower.
Now they are clean, I feel less aggressive, and I have two more hours that I will actually be able to enjoy instead of sitting around sulking.

Dark Spaces lie between, and within, our constructed places of light. They are inherently existent, as a means to differentiate between that which is foreground, middle-ground, and far-ground, and that which is vertically shallow, or exhibiting depth. Dark Space is shapeable, as it is with Light Space, yet Light Space (in seeking to remain transparent) becomes highly reflective of the personalities and forms which inhabit it.

As is our custom we decided that we would eat first, then go to show Maddie some of the great decorations in the neighborhood, then when we came back Santa would have arrived and we would proceed with opening the presents. M-t-G wasn't too thrilled with having to wait and said she wasn't hungry. I asked her if we let her have one present to open would she then come and eat without complaint until we were all done? She agreed (she is only 9 after all). We all agreed it was a plan and so we proceeded. It turned out that we each opened one gift and then went in to eat. (I guess we're all 9 at heart!)

I tried on a pair of slacks and a sport jacket. Stepping into an alcove of mirrors, I saw something I believe I was noticing for the first time. Not only was a mirror right in front of me, but booking off to either side were two other mirrors. By turning slightly, I could view the fit of the clothes, not just from the front, but from all sides. I could even position myself in such a way to see the back of my own head.

Consider the apostle preaching on Mars Hill in Acts 17:32. “And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter…Howbeit certain men clave unto him.” To those mockers and procrastinators Paul could well have said, “Ye should have hearkened unto me.”

Jesus is described as coming from Nazareth, however it is disputed whether there was such a town during his time. There is confusion over whether or not he had a family.

Each day this week open your heart to God’s grace and generosity with a “breath prayer.” Let your breath slow and deepen. Be aware of God’s breath moving in and out of your heart. Spend several minutes focusing on breathing in God’s generosity. With each breath, silently name one gift for which you are thankful. “God, I breathe in the gift of with thanks.” Let your heart expand to contain God’s gracious outpouring.
a) Photopage of passport
(We see domineering aunts, for example, from both North and South, who want to "rule" over their nephews and nieces.) There is a generation (probably those fifty and up) who CANNOT for one minute put the Civil War behind them, and there is a generation (especially those in their twenties and late teens) who don't quite understand why it still has to be such a big deal, who'd like to see some change or progress at least. There's definitely still tension between North and South as well. Our narrator is a "Yankee" visiting a Southern town. His "Yankee" aunt warns him throughout not to be too influenced by the Southerners. She doesn't want him to like or love his travels too much. And the people of the town, especially the Somebodies of the town, find it hard to open up with any Yankee no matter how seemingly charming. From the narrator's viewpoint, readers see the tension between these two sides is still very much alive. Race. This is a BIG, BIG, BIG issue in the novel. For better or worse. On one hand, it could always allow for discussion and critical thinking on the part of the reader. But on the other hand, it might make some very uncomfortable in the process. Because whether the "racism" is just racism by condescension or racism by pure ugliness and hatred, it is still very present in this novel. (Let's just say that the narrator and almost every single person in the novel does NOT believe in equality of the races, and most certainly does not believe that they should have the right to vote or hold any sort of political office.) Social class also plays a role in this one. We've got the tension between people who once had money but now only have class, manners, and pride. And the newly rich who many view as having NO class, and low morals.

Casting-wise this thing is a filmic wet-dream. It also opens up for a few fascinating possibilities… Such as, what if Nick Fury is just Jackson’s character from Snakes on a Plane having found a new purpose in life? (Explains the eye patch, right?) What if all Mark Ruffalo’s romantic comedies from now on are required to have him turn green and grab the female protagonist and fling her about her bedroom like a rag doll? What if Stellan Skarsgard learned a real accent and not that nether-region of a mangled mess of phonemes he currently uses? A better universe for everyone, I feel.

Then I remembered the caramel marscapone frosting I made for the Pierre Hermes Apricot Lime Financier Cake. That was not too sweet, had a little burnt sugar taste and would go well with toasted walnuts. As I was making it the thought of dates went through my head, their sweetness, the deep subtle flavor they would add, why not?
The story was also mega rare because at the time Western publishing had no desire to reprint the thing as some of the islanders depicted seemed to fall into the racial stereotyping quagmire and it wasn't until Oberon in Holland decided in the late 1970's to reprint ALL the Barks classic stories that this tale was dusted off and represented with the aid of genius draftsman Daan Jippes tracing some very shoddy photostats of the original comic.

This is quite concerning as the poll is is supposed to be about regeneration of Lancing yet it includes several questions about the BHA proposal and developing the Strategic Gap. Surely these are two separate issues. If he wants to know the views of people about the BHA application he only needs to visit the Adur Planning website to find out. There is also the issue that Adur Council is currently developing a new Development Framework Plan (Local Plan). When this is complete in a couple of months it will be put forward for FULL public consultation. That is the correct vehicle to seek public opinion about any changes to current policies concerning public open spaces and strategic gap. Not a poll purporting to be about Lancing Regeneration. Methinks that perhaps someone might be a tad concerned about the growing opposition to the BHA plan!

The cryproforest is also battered and paltry, a cheap undefined green that is not a forest, not a garden, not even a park, but give it half a chance and it will take over everywhere where humans retreat. The urbanism of the future is the cryptoforestation of derelict properties, abandoned carparks and never developed building sites. In this respect the economic crisis is on our side. Occupy communities are working toward it from the other end, and when the
The last presentation was held by Jenny ter Horst, a teacher at the Hogeschool of Amsterdam. This presentation was about future cities. She asked us all kind of things: what we liked about our own hometowns, what we didn’t liked and how we thought future cities will look like. Of course we don’t know for sure but by looking at trends and predict how they will look like made us think for a fitting campaign for Amsterdam. For example, we could do something with the ‘green’ trend which is very popular right now and probably will be in the future.
So I’m 6 for 7 consecutive attempts at Rocky. Not bad, given a “normal” 70% finish rate. So I’m still ahead of the odds. But in my mind, it just makes this year’s Rocky a 40-mile social training run. Last year’s painful debacle was different. Even though it was the most painful 100-miler that I’ve ever experienced (to date), I knew that I wasn’t doing any damage that would’ve kept me from running for very long. That’s why I persevered.
Mono red is all about one drops, and this is the king of them all. Automatic 4 damage on turn one. Playing 4 of these and 4 Thunderous Wrath will make quick work of the opponent. He’ll definitely be in this deck.

The other morning at the only surviving bookstore in this part of town, ready to be persuaded despite the histrionic title that I really needed to have the latest book by a well-known decorator, an erstwhile favorite of mine, and someone, I'm sure, nominated tastemaker and trend-setter many times over. I wasn't going to buy the book then and there because, being willing to defer gratification by a few days, I intended to order it online. In the end, though, after going through the book twice, I decided not to buy it at all. When a book, to my eye, is nothing more than a series of vignette after déshabille vignette, I find, much to my and undoubtedly the Celt's relief, that I no longer can be persuaded that I really need a book for its potential historical value, especially when, disconcertingly, I hear myself saying I might not live long enough for it to become history.
Operating with almost impunity, these pirates, joined by local criminal elements and fishermen who see the possibilities of making a quick million dollars, have been encouraged to continue with their criminal activities by the shipping companies who are only too keen to pay the large ransoms the pirates demand in order to secure the release of their vessels, crews and cargo. Whereas it is hoped that the shipping companies will do everything in their power to effect the release of their crews who man their ships - and the cargo they have been entrusted with - what about the ships? Do some shipping companies really want their ships back?

This used to be lots of fun in the Gardenweb perennial forum; gardeners would shock each other by revealing the plants they really can’t stand, regardless of said plants' popularity and virtuous habits. In a comment to my last post, Laurie nominates Echinacea (coneflower) and Autumn Joy sedum. I couldn’t agree more. Coneflower does look like a diseased daisy and Autumn Joy is just plain hidjous. Yet, you see both of these everywhere—usually in large groups. The Autumn Joy is tolerated because it blooms at a difficult time, I guess. But I’m not even sure if I would call what it produces a flower. I would suggest that people are much better off loading up on long-blooming annuals and self-seeders like (my favorite) Verbena boniarensis. Japanese anemone is a gorgeous late summer/fall flower, a gazelle to AJ’s warthog, though it’s not all that easy to grow. (They do very well with it in England.)
