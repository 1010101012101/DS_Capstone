Reynolds wasn't happy with the change, but the single went on to sell more than 1 million copies. The follow-up single, "Fire of Love," only made it to No. 66, and Reynolds never charted another hit. "Endless Sleep," though, became a genre classic. It was subsequently recorded by British musician Marty Wilde and became a hit in England, and it has since been covered by numerous artists, including the Judds, John Fogerty, Billy Idol, Leo Kottke and Hank Williams Jr. Country singer Bobbie Gentry was playing in Reynolds' band in the 1960s when she wrote "Ode to Billie Joe," her Southern Gothic spin on the teen tragedy formula.

-Vog remains an issue: Volcano fog is the result of activity from eruptions from Kilauea that began in 1983. But vog became an issue on the island with the extensive venting of gases from the Halemaumau Crater beginning in 2008. The fumes are dangerously close to the venting point at Kilauea, and roads and hiking trails have been closed. The vog can float up the Kona and Kohala coasts, making for hazy days and atomic-colored sunsets because of the particles. The sulfur dioxide is especially hazardous only near the volcano, but those with respiratory ailments, the very young and the very old should monitor vog conditions. You can do that at the website run by the Vog Measurement and Prediction Project of the University of Hawaii, Hilo. Go to mkwc. ifa.hawaii.edu/vmap/index .cgi for up-to-date forecasts and modeling of wind currents. A recorded daily forecast of volcano activity can be heard by dialing 808-967-8862.

Since then, the flavor of Wellington has been set: international, Mediterranean, coffee-obsessed.

"I think the sad truth is those kids were used to being able to bully Alex largely without consequence," Hirsch says. "At one point during that school year, $15 was stolen from a teacher. It was like a five-alarm fire. There were police cars, principals running up and down the hallway. The kids got a very clear message that stealing was not OK.

To get a visitor's visa, your mother would need to prove that she will return to Pakistan after her visit. Given that she is disabled and has a U.S. citizen daughter here, that will be difficult.
