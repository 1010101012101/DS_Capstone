- 8 Shrimp (rinsed) and 4 Tbsp cocktail sauce: The perfect appetizer.
Some months earlier there'd been discussions about secondary school. This was in the days when the Eleven Plus was still widespread, when children were categorised, classified and labelled on the basis of a three-part test. My big sister had already passed hers and was attending the local grammar school, but I wasn't daunted. I'd spent most of my life playing word games and doing puzzles; I knew the smug satisfaction of getting a sum right, demonstrating my comprehension skills, predicting the next shape or number in a series.I was one of those sickening kids who actually liked tests; I positively looked forward to it.
Pictures forthcoming of course. xoxo
Everything that you've always dreamed of
In the meantime, here are a few of the shots I've taken over the last 7 or 8 days.
Last week’s post on the problematic nature of binary thinking went out of its way to sidestep the most explosive of the binaries in contemporary industrial culture. That was a necessary evasion; those of my readers who are following the argument I’ve been developing over most of the last two months have now had a week to mull over the point I’ve raised in that post, to consider its pitfalls and possibilities, and to get ready for a hard look the most sacrosanct binary of our time: the binary between society as it is and society as we want it to become.
To walk today in remembrance,

CL. There was quite a long process of organisation and re-cataloguing after the archive arrived at CRiSAP. Once we had decided to try and place it within the UAL Archives and Special Collections we worked with the archivists there to get it into the state that they required. We had always thought that we would have a small launch event just to say, “it’s here” maybe a study day at LCC. However Tate were interested – Electra were interested – and it grew from there.
Even as Australia continues to rise, I do feel like the punk/noise/DIY/underground might've peaked a few years ago, but I still do find plenty to enjoy every week among the records, tapes, demos, and streams that continue to cram the mailbox at KDVS and my P.O. box through perhaps too many purchases. 'Til I'm down to my last dollar, that's when I'll buy my last record.

I think its interesting how it gets lost by some, that Rene knew I was cross dressing before we married. And in her words "This was not something that was going to get in the way of our marriage", and "...was something she could live with".
Golden light burst out into the cavern, centered on the artifact before Kostya. It forced him to his knees and his hands lept to close his visor. Fear gripped him now. Unsure of what he was about to see. Kostya lowered his hand and gazed at the artifact before him. A golden chest sat upon a high, rocky platform. It radiated its own golden light into the room. Upon its top at either end, were statues of two angels. Their wings were outstretched toward one another, the tips touching. Kostya gasped.
"Jesus Loves him"

Having been here and always associated the signs garishness with the failed chicken spot, I clearly lack the vision that a newcomer gets of that sign. I've heard people talk about it like it was a stone tablet from deities, taunting overhead, never leaving the mountain top. I've seen hundreds of photos of the sign. (which is why I never take a photo of it) I felt it reached the zenith when pictures of the old yellow and black evocative description made it into a show at the Brooklyn Museum. All I could do was shake my head. For me, a life long resident of the area, it was no different than walking out one day and seeing all the teenagers wearing something ridiculous, in unison, in the name of their own sense of fashion.
We returned home on the 27th and enjoyed a low key week of family time prior to ringing in the new year with family and friends. It was totally chaotic with 8 adults and 7 kids aged 3 and under, but represented life as we know it perfectly :)
Come to me now, honey.
So didn’t find the third I was hoping to find so decided it was time for home, could we beat daddy back to the front door? Actually, that was a big NO! Raining as it were ended up chatting to some random male dog walker near the very open field, thus meaning we were caught up in the hail stones, well I say hail stones more like 60mph lashing down bloody ice bergs, ouch they hurt when they hit your skin! Safely to the other side of the field, boots muddied and it is still pelting down with icebergs – no, I’m not talking type of lettuce either, more like the mini cousins of that monstrosity the titanic hit 100 years ago – We then get to the woods.

I am realist. I’m certainly in the minority in my way of thinking (especially among my demographic). I worry about the future of the bowls (not the game formerly known as the Papa John’s.com Bowl, but the Cotton, Rose, Sugar and Orange). A playoff is coming, so we all have to accept/embrace it.
Undeterred yet solemn still, the party set out across the Ashen Wastes–their efforts in the precluding weeks having eliminated several of the recurring threats of the environs. Apart from a bout of acid rains, their journey was uneventful–and soon enough the party had arrived before an immense spread of nearly jungle-like vegetation in the middle of the wasteland. Upon the wall of living hedges were fastened the polished skulls of numerous demons–a daunting and foreboding sight.
as we wind round the several peninsulas of our pleasure, channel flip to flip, the eye, astir, perches apoplectic as a statue. the slate and tongue-stunted gauze of turning down, down the mind: a straggling herd of vague and varied feelings stutters the fantastic landscape. Inciting interest and cupidity in alternating waves.
“It was the most anti-small business administration I’ve seen probably since Carter,” he said. “Who would’ve guessed we’d look back at the Carter years as the good ol' days, you know? And you just go through the president’s agenda over the last, uh, the last several years and ask yourself, did this help small business or did it hurt small business?”

It claimed that using the image ‘is a big issue because this packaging will potentially land in both Northern Ireland and Scotland stores’. That is despite both being represented in the flag, playing a key role in the jubilee celebrations and being part of team GB at London 2012.
We might start with the Macpherson definition of a racist incident which replaces that in force at the time of Stephen Lawrence’s murder. Macpherson rejects the existing definition for two reasons. First, because he finds the word “racial” unacceptable. Second, in the climate of worshipping the “oppressed”, many of whom, I suspect, will not be aware that they are indeed being “oppressed”, he wants to make the definition more “victim oriented” (para, 45.16). Rejection of “racial” or “racially motivated” is justified thus:
and I didn’t feel like very much.
Also, the style of drawing I think really reflects Series Five’s fairytale-like quality. I could easily see this picture in a children’s storybook. Utterly brilliant.

The promotion of the possibility of amicable relations between the Native Americans and Europeans was of great importance to the Virginia Company of London, which administered the colonies in that region. Upon hearing about the marriage of a native Princess to an English gentleman they ordered the colonial governor, Sir Thomas Dale, to bring Pocahontas to England. In June 1616, Rolfe, his wife and around a dozen of her countrymen including a holy man called Tomocomo, arrived at Plymouth. From there they travelled to London where she attended various society events as well as being received by Queen Anne. The Powhatans found the foul air of London disagreeable and within months they moved to the nearby village of Brentford, where Pocahontas had an emotional reunion with John Smith, who she thought to be dead.
Notes: These should be all out efforts. Keep track of each round and if there is greater than a +/- 5 second differential between any round there is a 25 Burpee penalty.
I know it looks very funny, mostly because my image editing skills are close to nonexistent. But all I really did was take pictures to remember exactly what I had swatched in order – so I just cut and paste the labels (saves me having to type out every name). This was done in-store, obviously, under bright fluorescent light.
My back was a bit sore already from getting hay in the morning, but I wanted to ride and needed to ride, so I wasn't letting this stop me. As much as she is built more suited to hunters, the dressage saddle fits her better, so I have been using it. I also feel more secure in it, like it has a deeper seat which it doesn't, but whatever. I also worked on letting go of the reins and allowing her to have her head more, to pick her way around the arena.
And finally, our last hint of the day. Many of you have come to our booths and wondered if our displays were on sale. We have always replied no and encouraged you guys to make them yourselves with our easy DIY kits. But this year, seeing that Christmas is coming near, we will be selling our displays at great prices! Some of them can be seen from our Facebook album and will make beautiful Christmas gifts. Take-out delivery indeed - cooked to perfection for your enjoyment! :)

When I browsed for Rivka Galchen articles the other day, I found a few published works that were not in Harper’s or The New Yorker. So, yes, I’m going to write about them here. And since I’m caught up with the end of Gravity’s Rainbow, these short non-fictions were a nice balm.
One thing I have absolutely no problem with is the suspense and intrigue. The author chose the most suspenseful and interesting topic for a generation long mystery. In the author’s note, Dan Walsh says that it’s all fiction and he was running off of the “what if” of it all. If this is what the author comes up with on just “what if” I wonder what he would do if he had more to go on.
When you arrive in South Tyrol and see all these fruit fields, small villages you feel comfortably being in a natural habitat. To that point nothing can destroy your inner warmth that you experience – pure nature. In addition to that, because most tourists have been there for several times, it feels like coming home. Plus most of you are travelling with friends and family. So South Tyrol is covering the 3 most desired influences that gives each one of us joy and happiness – nature, home, family/friends.
Being grateful is like choosing to dwell in the blessings of the everyday instead of drowning in the minutia of what’s not well. Remember in Philippians…Paul says: God is near. Yes God is near. He is here. It is the power of the resurrection we celebrated so mightily at Easter. Jesus died and came alive to bring us real life here and now- not just when we die. And because He left His spirit here, we know that God is in this place. We see markers of God’s presence at every good and joyful thing on earth. Anything good here on Earth? That sunrise, the laugh of my two-year old, the kiss from a lover, the first beat of a new album…its all from HIM.
Small technical point of advice to the moron who constructed this, there is no such position as "Governor of International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the United Kingdom".
I am honestly not making this up; she actually said it. I had committed the one truly unacceptable sin: not accepting frivolous rantings as legitimate and telling her that I had no intention to indulge her in them. Her tirade soon spread from dishes to all matters, no matter how unrelated.
But I’ve noticed I’m not the only one. Seems like more and more people, religions, and cultures are believing the advanced version of this dependency on ourselves I fall into so easily. The advanced version can be summed up by the words of Julia Roberts in Eat Pray Love: God dwells within you, as you.

These muffins are perfect for breakfast or snacks on the go. They're moist, sweet, and dense with a golden crust. We had these everyday for breakfast this week, and had enough to send one for the school bus driver each day. I liked how long they lasted in the cookie jar, as my Banana Oat Mini Muffins need to be eaten within a few short days.

Teddy Long is being harassed by William Regal, which is hilarious. He then is being harassed by Aksana, who is with another new Wrestler, his name is Antonio Cesaro, who is the former Claudio Castagnoli. Of course, since Teddy is acting like an officer guard, he doesn’t say a word, and Aksana makes fun of him for not being the boss anymore, so Johnny invites them both into his office to discuss the details of a contract.
Recently I have been blessed to get to know several wonderful Christians who truly inspire me. They are people who have spent a lot of time sitting at the feet of Jesus. I admire the many spiritual gifts in their lives and in particular the gifts of wisdom, self-control and love (the unconditional kind). When they speak of others they practice great self-control and in both their thinking, their words and their actions. They speak good of others, no matter what. It’s inspiring. They make me long for the fruits I see in their lives.

He sat at the other end of the office. I couldn't see him from my desk, but I could hear him. Some days he drove me mad, coughing and clearing his throat, until I ended up choking in strange sympathy. Other days he circulated Tommy Cooper jokes that caused a ripple of laughter to circulate round the office, so you'd know each time someone else opened the e-mail.

• How to fix copyright, by Bill Patry, published by Oxford University Press. This controversial author's thesis is based on what he describes as "the need to recognize that the consumer is king". Patry maintains that law can only solve legal problems, not business problems, and too often an attempt is made to invoke law in order to solve business problems. He also offers a series of pragmatic fixes that steer a middle course between an overly expansive interpretation of copyright protection and abandoning it altogether. Further details available from the publisher's website here.

I started in draft with the late Dick Shumer, a serious master drafter, trainer, and friend. Dick Shumer was a Jack of all trades who taught more than just canine drafting. He also taught us how to build carts, how to jerry-rig just about anything, and he was the absolute king of bungee cords. Dick is the kind of person that gives and gives, and never expects anything in return except for the satisfaction of his students being happy. He taught us the meaning of generosity, patience, and forgiveness. Thank you for so much you have done for me and the Austin canine drafting community.

SO here we are now, I have a plan of action, I’ve expanded my horizons of thought and desire. This year Inshallah one way or another I will be published, in that my book will be on bookshelves.

At the same time, Beverly Crusher is still thinking about the job offer she had for the head of Starfleet Medical. She and her team goes over the medical side of things, looking for anything which might have caused the sudden violence. Meanwhile, the engineering department is suffering from a supply problem; there are fewer ships and less supplies to go around after the war. So, Geordi LaForge decides to do some old fashioned trading. I found this amusing and a good counterpoint to the rather depressing main plot. However, they have state of the art replicators. Why don’t they just replicate the parts?
This means I will continue to pray. I will pray for the mothers, the children, my friends and my family, but I will also pray for myself. God will decide how He answers my prayers, but I will offer them up to Him just as well. After all, what fun would it be to have a conversation with a friend when all you do is let them talk and don't offer any conversation in return?
It becomes a case of if “A” caused no harm, then implementing the next logical step of ‘B” should also cause no harm, and be even more beneficial to society as well. The Slippery Slope turns out to be, more often than not, the path of least resistance that enables the population to assign blame without remorse, attach cause where none is evident, and embrace bigotry and discrimination without conscience based solely on the personal choices that others may make.
Everyone is at different stages on their creative journeys and all with different interests. So we do not dismiss anyone - we support them.

Over these past ten years, I’ve learned so many valuable lessons that have stemmed from that loss. I now know that I will never make everyone happy, so I don’t try. I know that I am the one and only person responsible for my own happiness. I know that in order for me to be a happy, healthy person who can take care of her family, I must take care of me first, and then take care of my family. And I know that involves being a tad selfish at times. I know that there are angels. And I know that like my grandmother had a vision of my girls just days before she died, I know my girls have seen their own grandmother. I’ve seen it in their little faces, especially when they were babies and they’d smile and giggle at something over my shoulder, yet every time I’d turned to look, there’d be nothing there. I see it in them now as they find their faith and ask me questions about her. I’ve felt her presence around me when I’ve needed it most. I’ve felt her encouragement when I’ve been afraid to take a step. I’ve heard her laughter when I’ve needed joy. And I’ve learned that she remains, in me, in my children, in the angel on top of my Christmas tree, in this life that I have created with this family. She’s here.
There is no denying the fact that people who have a college degree are more valued and sought after in the job market compared to those who have just passed high school. Especially, since the time recession has begun, recruitment in the corporate sector is moving at a snail's pace. And even if companies do recruit people, they would obviously prefer the ones with a college education, reason enough for continuing education.
Britney has a certain Marilyn Monroe quality. Remember the headlines when Marilyn died...The most popular girl in America died alone on a Saturday night. Gloria Steinman wrote a great book about Marilyn Monroe that I believe eventually came to BE popular opinion. Which is that Marilyn Monroe felt that no-one cared about her, they only loved her image. She spent her life trying to find someone who loved who she was on the inside, someone who loved Norma Jean, not Marilyn Monroe. I believe that this is what Britney thought she was getting when she met K-Fed. Someone who saw Britney, the little girl from Louisiana, not Britney...pop idol.

In the second Pro Elite hevyweight grand prix match up of the night, Cody Griffin faced off against Justyn Riley for the right to advance to the next round of the tournament.
The second was easily covered up what with the girl's overwhelming lack of self worth and tendency to delude herself into oblivion. The poor girl honestly believes that he has been faithful to her throughout their entire relationship. Not so. To this woman, I say, "Leave him. You know he's unfaithful, and you are worth so much more than that."

Who would want to do that? I asked myself, she has a lot of friends and she does not get involved in polemics. Silvia Kusada, is the most sincere and caring person I ever met in my life. She is a Class VI, OT VII who speaks three languages and built her home with her own hands.
I can’t say I learned anything new as his speech was a typical stump speech covering a lot of the same themes as his CPAC speech but it became all to clear that he is not the lifeless clod the media tries to portray him as. He is quite charismatic (and this is coming from a person who doesn’t like or respond to charisma all that much). And what is really nice, what I am seeing in a lot of his speeches is that he doesn’t just reference the Founders or the founding documents, he quotes from them with a depth of knowledge and can elucidate their meanings with complete understanding (unlike, say, Santorum who thinks that when they said “pursuit of happiness” what they really meant was “abject debasing before a theocracy” because you can clearly see that’s what they meant, can’t you?).
And then there are the battle scenes, which are just fantastic. Every time Scott Pilgrim meet one of the evil exes the camera zooms out into a final boss battle style from computer games. Each battle is fought in a slightly different computer game genre, e.g. fighting games, music games, monster battles, sword battles… you get the idea. I got that kind of rosy feeling every time one starts. In fact my chest tightened ever so slightly in the same way it does when you get to a boss-battle in a real computer game.
It hasn't been easy. I have had to change my lifestyle. I thought I was eating healthy before, but keeping a food diary has helped me realize exactly what I was consuming and also helped me realize that I was consuming too much. I have reduced the refined sugar and flour that I eat. I have increased the lean protein that I consume. I have changed my ways.

It is an accepted reality that not all Malaysians are ready to totally shed their racial identity and call themselves Malaysians. For this ideal to morph into reality it may take another few generations. But UMNO does not seem to have the formula for this quandary. First, the poor and marginalized Malays, Indians, Chinese and the Indigenous are those that need to be helped to pull them into a level playing ground. As practised by UMNO, enriching a selected few among their cronies is not the solution to national unity.

(that wasn't big enough to do flips on). On a whim two Sundays ago, I listed it on Craigslist, for just a few hundred dollars less than what we originally paid for it last year. Wouldn't you know, I got tons of e-mails and a buyer who never even tried to negotiate the price. Seriously, people, if you have ever bought anything on Craigslist, you know the first thing you do is ask if they will take less.

They don’t belong there, it’s my TV and they must be put in their place. The same with my walks. Why do other dogs feel a need to intrude upon my walks. I love my walks and I only like to share them with my buddy Bear.

Martial arts blogger John Vesia had an interesting post back in November, which I'm only finding now, about boxers who could have been martial artists. It stimulated an interesting discussion about whether boxing is a martial art (many of his readers didn't think so), and whether fighting arts are martial arts. There's a boxing coach, Christy Halbert, author of The Ultimate Boxer, who makes the interesting argument that a boxing match isn't a fight because the boxers aren't angry at each other; they often have tremendous respect for their opponents in the ring.
*Social Studies: I'm going to encourage study of Aztec and other similar civilizations. I'm not sure how Montessori junior highs cover this kind of thing, or even if they specifically do, but rather than the elementary level's focus on needs, her fascination is on their beliefs. I think studying specifically their religion and government would fit well with her age level.
We are not lovers, but we do love each other. And yes, my wife Jean knows all about her, and has frequently had friendly conversations with her on the phone. Jean doesn’t have any issues or concerns about us and our “relationship” because she knows that there is no reason for her to be concerned.
The second reason, which would have been especially pertinent from the late 70s onwards, is that the PIRA understood by then, at least at leadership level, that its early 1970s objective of forcing British forces out of NI through physical force alone was untenable. What this meant was that any conceivable withdrawal of those forces would have to take place, eventually, on the basis of a process that was at least partly political. This in turn could not happen if the PIRA was seen by the British as a viciously sectarian murder gang, as it would have been impossible for the British government to negotiate with such a force. When loyalist sectarian killing flared up again in the late 80s, PIRA members were expressly forbidden from retaliating in kind for this reason. However, there were no similar restrictions on the behaviour of loyalist paramilitaries, who were fighting not to overturn a status quo, but to preserve it. For most of the conflict, they had little interest in presenting themselves as being a reasonably ‘civilized’ political force with whom one might do business, or for whom one might vote.

During my hiatus from facebook, a close friend of his moved to Las Vegas and another had a baby. We knew of neither of these events because our daily, face-to-face social networks included neither of these friends. Being disconnected is possible, but one has to be making the decision to be disconnected while consciously aware of the real likelihood of losing touch with people whose primary means of communication is a social network online.
Yes, there were dance moves.

"Along came Forest City Ratner," he said. "If you need a job, color do no make a difference," he said, taking pains to avoid rhetoric from the meeting of July 22, where he said, "Maybe you don’t want to hear it, but black folks are not working in our community."
Read technology news to see where the trends are going. I don’t really think a j-student needs to know programing language, but it doesn’t hurt to take a few computing classes to get a sense of how things work. Get to know computer engineering students, especially those interested in online publishing.

As you know, for many years, the policy regarding use of the Capitol grounds has been quite simple. Each and every group - be it civic, educational, or yes, political in nature – has been required to fill out a permit application. This application is kept on file, to ensure that all activities are on the calendar and both staff and security are aware. Furthermore, the permits prevent scheduling conflicts and possible friction between groups.
Thanks again to everyone who participated.

It is crucial that every one businesses are correctly covered, notably with the big insurgence in promises towards providers lately. There’s a person dealer that rises that as each and every company and the possibility mounted on their market differs, so should the insurance policies available to them. This is why they have got developed a division in their enterprise that specialises in offering recycling insurance plan to those within the squander and recycling market. But what exactly is recycling insurance plan and exactly what does it incorporate?

I refused to apply her instructions of course. I knew that she respected me and that she was afraid of me because she perceives me as someone confident and stubborn. She knew that I was authorized by the fund provided (The High Commission for Refugees in Jordan) to call in any cheating or forgery in documentation. I knew that she and her staff didn’t like me because I didn’t bring the organization any money. I spent all the money on deserving Iraqi women and children according to budget plan. Spending included also procurements for the project and the salary of employees who worked on the project.

I am writing a couple more long posts on legal education (here is my first: Law Review: Law Student Special – From here to eternity… (Part I)) and will return to the issue of standards in legal education then. The comments at the foot of The Lawyer article are worth reading. I have some sympathy with some of the views expressed by students. I liked the one where a student said… “Makes you wonder why you pay eight grand for a reading list and a library card.”
Flights: We flew to Paris on Air France, and it was surprisingly smooth. The food service was actually really good, and the kids received toys with their meals. On the flight back we had personal televisions, and I watched THREE movies. Totally unheard of for me, but very enjoyable. Max did pretty well with the flights and slept some on both legs of the journey, but Hannah seems to have inherited my inability to sleep on planes.
We made an amazing Indian chicken dish for dinner on Saturday night, I've only attempted a curry once and it was dissapointing. This wasn't a curry but it was lick the plate good and it was a blast to cook in our new kitchen together. WHAT?!? I forgot to tell you we remodeled the kitchen? Bad Bad BeeBee. Let me see if I can cobble together some photos of the before and after for you, later - my browser on this computer doesn't really play well with Blogger.
It is a delight that an entire room of his work is currently on loan to Tate Modern from a private collection. Because this is a free “display” rather than a paying exhibition it has not been hyped by the media and it’s really not to be missed.
I had been hearing great things about this book all over the place: Goodreads, blogs, Youtube. I finally picked it up at my bookstore, determined to start it that day. I put it on my shelf and kept telling myself that I was going to read it next, but it kept getting pushed back for some reason or the other. Finally, a friend told me that they really liked the book, so I decided to finally pick it up and read it. Boy am I glad that I did. The book did take me a while to get through, but that was due to outside forces. If I had my way, and the attention span, I would have sat and read this book much quicker.

Since this president took office, U.S. businesses have shed 3.3 million jobs. We are still 6.9 million below our peak employment reached in January 2008. Ordinarily, more than two years after a recession has ended, well over a million jobs have been added to payrolls.

I am sending a shout out to my daughter, Miss Christine,
Next I prepared the overdrapery fabric the same way, measure, cut, hem, pleat, steam.......... (I did make the left and right "returns" 3/8" wide so that they would cover the sides of the wood frame) When this one was cool and dry I removed it from the pleater and pinned it to a piece of 1/2" foam core board. I pushed the pleats together at the top and securely pinned, then I determined where I wanted to tie them back. I pinned the folds at the bottom outer corners pulling them fairly taught. Next I carefully pulled up and shaped a graceful sort of curve at the tieback point and pinned this to the foam core board. When I was happy with both panels I steamed them again and misted them with "White Rain" hairspray. When dry, they will retain this shape. When you install your Treatment in your house or room it may be necessary to glue and pin the folds at the floor level to keep them looking straight and natural.
Not that the rest of humanity is as forgiving; after the critical drubbing it got in its initial release, Escapes didn't exactly make the most of its pedigree; director, writer, FX and everything right down to the cinematography may have been the same if not similar, but it just didn't have the one thing that every other Kong movie had: a sense of fun.
“Fingers crossed that’s changing because the proliferation of people watching very quickfire things on computer screens and laptops means that actually sitting down and watching a television show on Monday evening at nine o’clock is starting to become a real treat to be valued in the same way as going to the cinema or theatre is. And hopefully it will start being seen as an art form, because it is. Some of the writing for television in this country is world class and we should celebrate it.”

In 4 weeks time I will be going away with my girls to our usual spot but this time it will be beach weather (yay so exited!!!!). I believe this its the first time in years that I can safely say that I look ok in bathers and I don’t really need to wear shorts as my legs and thighs have toned up considerably from all the running I have done. In setting that though I want to look the best I possibly can in my bathers. So I am challenging myself to exercise everyday until we go away! This is a challenge as I don’t have a car at the moment so getting to the gym is hard but it has been 4 days so far and I have done something everyday! I know you need to give your body rest days but I am not going hard everyday and it is only for a short period. However I would like to continue exercising at least 5 days after we have been away. I just feel better for it (already) and have been really good with my food. I have tracked everyday and kept a close watch on what I have been putting in my mouth! So far so good but we will see on tuesday when I weigh in!

Although Toselli's creative way of painting differs completely from the usual monochromatic colour scheme in Burano, I couldn't trace any reports with regard to authorities making objections. Perhaps they have seen the project as a contribution to the promotion of tourist traffic, which it obviously has done. .
And I have a small confession to make something I would have never thought possible! I am getting a bit sick of my daily bowl of oatmeal, I know this is shocking! But as I was flipping through recipes last night Pumpkin Pancakes caught my eye! The only problem was that I was not finding a recipe that I absolutely fell in love with. The recipes either had way way to many ingredients or had things I didn't have (like bisquick). So I developed a plan or I guess an idea and prayed that today when I set out to make these pumpkin pancakes that my idea would work!

After considering several outfits Strawberry and I settled on this sweet top and pants set. It even has instructions for felted shoes. I had plenty of yarn in my stash including one that could be felted so we picked a color that would match the felting yarn and I cast on. Of course I'm still too chicken to try double pointed needles and started the pants on circular needles instead!

Squash match against Jiro. (Poor guy). Conor O’Brian is the star focus. I hate squash matches. Hate them! But I love the electricity and flow when Ascension steps out. Cameron and O’Brian pretty much personify the dark vampire-like feel in their movements, actions, and very presence. I get chills watching them, and for that they go on the list because I want to rewind the entrance over and over. I like Jiro, hate squash matches, but love this feeling.
Over at Der Tagesspeigel my twitter friend Claudia Von Salzen, a stalwart defender of human rights and who regularly highlights Ms Tymoshenko’s plight, does not see her as the lens through which Ukraine should solely be viewed. She is quite right.

I've looked through some at stores and just can't find the ONE I like. I use to be really really good at scrapbooking, now I just don't make enough time to do it and I think that after she comes I really won't have enough time to do it...probably why I don't have one!

Nora never lets me down. I know I’m going to get a plot which involves either a female or male protagonist with issues. The woman will be feisty and independent, yet vulnerable in some way. The man will be ruggedly handsome and instantly attracted to the woman – not without some angst. The story will be set in small town, beautiful America somewhere. The characters will cook a lot, eat a lot, fight a lot, make-up a lot, resolve a life-or-death situation, and there is usually a cute dog thrown in there as well. And it always ends with all the problems and issues resolved and happily ever after.
Considering autumn is my favorite season, I really didn't dive into fall decorating this year.
Step 3. Now this will depend on the strength of colour of the Re-Inker as well. Colours like spun sugar will no matter how much Re-Inker you add only ever give you the barest hint of colour so choose slightly darker colours if you want bold bright mists. Add in one eye dropper full of your Re-Inker, put your spray nozzle back on and mix well, do a test Spritz on a blank piece of white paper to see if you like the strength of the colour. If it is not strong enough add some more Re-Inker, this takes a little bit of intuition as you may need one or two more eye droppers full or just a few more drops. Think about the depth of colour you want.
When meat is cooked at high temperatures, it causes a certain chemical reaction – Creatine and amino acids react together to form heterocyclic amines – it’s these that are believed to be one of the causes of cancer, although meat that is roasted or baked in the oven (and not at really high temperatures) is likely not to contain so much in the way of heterocyclic amines. Throw in the issue of grilling over coals though, and you conjure up a whole new health risk, according to the June 2007 issue of the Harvard Health Letter. Apparently there are chemicals that can cause cancer in the smoke that comes off the barbecue, and they can be absorbed by the meat you are cooking. It has been suggested that marinating meat can help to cut down on the presence of heterocyclic amines but opinion is divided on how effective this is. However, the Health letter does suggest some ways to cut down the risk including:
There is a prescription for this that has no known side effects: spending time in nature. The use of nature for human resource development in organizations offers a new and creative approach to helping employees cope with the stress of work.
Besides being probably the largest Pro-Life March in Washington to commemorate the January 22, 1973 U. S. Supreme Court’s unconstitutional rulings that legalized child-killing in America, this year’s 37th annual March for Life afforded many opportunities to advance our cause.

But then I spot a frog, beautiful and tiny and green, on the washrag floating in the water by Benjamin’s left foot. I look at Justin. He grins. “Snnneeeaaakky!” I tell him with a smile. He shrugs, “I know. I want to see if he’ll find it.”

I’ve had a lot more ideas for other songs to do though so we’ll see how things pan out from here. One thing I’ve realised though is that whatever goals you have, the fact that YOU have them means you can achieve them. You can do what you set out to do, mostly.
She returned. "It was $1.98" she said sternly. She took a deap breath, "But now I'm going to have to get a manager to override this price differential. I don't know where she is right now."
On the topic of his own very revealing role in the “Someone I Used To Know” video, Gotye assured Jayn at Alice@97.3 that he was “wearing some underpants craftily chopped and gaffed taped to bits of me that you don’t see.”
I starting chatting with Grandpa online (I think match.com) and gave him my instant messenger name. We would catch up, and talk about our day. He seemed witty and fun, however for some reason I never saw a picture of him (no warning signs went off about this, I had yet to acquire the proper bells and whistles that go off when you become a skilled internet dater). He was pretty aggressive and wanted to meet. Hey, why not! We exchanged cell numbers and planned to meet at a local restaurant/bar for drinks.
Here, however, the sailors change their minds again and blame the Mariner for the torment of their thirst. In anger, the crew forces the Mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck, perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it, or perhaps as a sign of regret (“Ah! Well a-day! What evil looks / Had I from old and young! / Instead of the cross, the albatross / About my neck was hung”). Eventually, in an eerie passage, the ship encounters a ghostly vessel. On board are Death (a skeleton) and the “Night-mare Life-in-Death” (a deathly-pale woman), who are playing dice for the souls of the crew. With a roll of the dice, Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-in-Death the life of the Mariner, a prize she considers more valuable. Her name is a clue as to the Mariner’s fate; he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross.
Gentrification is not unique to Brooklyn, or even New York. Osman points to Boston’s Beacon Hill, Chicago’s Lincoln Park and Georgetown in Washington, D.C. as other famous examples, and argues that such movements were taking place even in smaller cities. He cites a 1976 Urban Land Institute study that found versions of “brownstoning” in a majority of the country’s 260 cities with populations of 50,000 or more.

Anyway, I have started writing Chapter 6, which is the BIG discussion chapter that weaves all the findings together, and it is totally draining me. For this chapter, Yoda tells me to write an overview of all the three studies I've done and summarize the findings in one section. Easier said than done of course. Once I've written that part, I need to proceed with the research implication section, which is divided into two categories; practical/pedagogical and theoretical.

Warren is getting attention and he really only has an idea of where the body may be, whatever body it is, was dumped. He is trying to fund his expedition, which he states would take between $200,000 and $400,000 to execute. As for me, it costs more than $400,000 to mount one of our Treasure Expeditions and yes; our missions regularly find dead bodies, but $400,000 spent to recover $50,000,0000 or $700,000,000 is more my taste, not just to try to prove up some conspiracy theory.
Does anybody out there have an answer? If so, please share it with me. In the meantime, I will finally crawl into my cozy bed.

To college coaches who have not seen this young man on the court, I recommend taking a close look at what he can do. He may not be a top ten talent, but what he can do is help a team for multiple years. I don’t predict him being a one-and-done prospect, therefore he’s a player who will stay at a school long term and be very productive during that time. There’s a huge upside on this guy!

List item number two. I had a question for anyone who would listen about a wound care issue that I won't detail here, but I basically felt as if they said "Ah, it's SB - it's gonna be an issue."

Some insurance companies believe that the older you are, the harder it is to receive life insurance. Depending on your age and the type of policy, you may find that obtaining life insurance can be difficult, if not impossible. Most life insurance companies do not offer term life policies after you reach age 70.

This model will continue to be improved as I learn more of the programs features. It is still valid and the simulation matches what occurs in EVE. That aside there is still many more things I need to include for better accuracy and realism. This includes adding characters as production resources, running production jobs in batches with gaps between them to signify when I would likely start them (ie I am not online 24hrs 7 days to do this haha), incorporating BPC invention and transportation.

On Christmas Eve we would gather at their home with aunts and uncles and great grandparents to open gifts. There would be a dish with orange slices on the table, chocolate cremes too, and Mae would make rice krispie treats in the electric skillet, sitting them out on the porch to cool. All the while we would be sitting in front of the TV watching for Santa's approach to our area. And her amazing silver tinsel tree, with a rotating colored light, would be sitting off to the side, glowing first one color then another as we opened our gifts.
It wasn't reader-led but all to do with the growing commercially minded philosophy that grew out of the '80s, of wanting to make as much money as possible while spending as little as possible.

Paul Taylor and I collaborated on a TinyTLF demo for 360|Flex last fall that used a quadratic Beizer spline to form left and right vertical constraints for dynamic text layout. After the demo, a few people said it would be really cool to see the text scroll. The idea scroller, however, should be organic to match the text boundaries, just as a vertical scroller matches a straight-line text boundary. Since the spline boundary is dynamic, this means the scroller track and thumb should be dynamically drawn.

Byers is slated to play a total of 12 shows on this leg of the tour, that will feature a mix of his favorite tunes by The Specials and many of his own songs written for The Skabilly Rebels, that showcase the ska/punk/rockabilly sound he invented with The Specials. The tour kicks off on February 23rd, 2012 and will go until March 11th, 2012. More dates and venues will be announced this week, and will include stops across California, Reno and Phoenix. Rumors are that Byers may plan to hit the East Coast of the U.S. later this year.

It’s fearless. It’s a movie that is not afraid to offend/criticise/mock anything or anybody. The great thing is that many of the jokes are funny because they take situations too far, farther than most movies would go with a joke. That shock is actually very funny. And underneath the carnality and buckets of blood, it’s a smart movie with inspiration from Sam Fuller, Roger Corman and many other legendary filmmakers and movies.

Lately I haven’t been writing much, mainly because I didn’t have much inspiration to write. Also been busy going out and about lately….. Life without 9-to-5 routine is good and bad. Good that I have more “free” time to do anything I’d like. Bad because there is a lack of structure in my days…. but the worst is there is a strong nudge from within to get a job – or let me correct – an income for my survival!

My bench-rest pals weren't exactly pleased with that .30 going off again and again and again, 3-4 times a minute, right down the line from them. And of course I was doing what I tend to do when bench-resters are present--We're seated beneath a corrugated metal roof and the rifle muzzles normally protrude out past the roof when the shooter is properly seated at the bench. I've been known to sit back just far enough to bring the rifle muzzle back under the metal, with the result that it's blast echoes clear down the line and rattles everyone's dental fillings.
I arrived at the “commune” – that’s how my capetownian couch surfing friends called their house, and the word was simply perfect for it. What I liked most about them was that you never knew what could happen next, so that same night we ended up at a rock concert armed with our bandanas on our foreheads like a glam band from the eighties.

The linchpin of Labour's campaign is a series of allegations that the Tories have broken the Council's Code of Conduct. The allegations centre around apparent uses of Council resources for party political purposes, including the alleged use on election leaflets of a Council email address and a photograph of a candidate wearing a Council name badge.

On one occasion when Wither was banged up in the Tower of London in the shadow of the headsman's axe, another almost equally bad minor poet, Sir John Denham, begged King Charles I to spare Wither's life, on the grounds that as long as Wither lived, Denham would not be accounted the worst poet in England.

I was indeed able to do some rewrites on this chapter. I didn't take anything out, I just added a few bits in here and there. I was able to do it yesterday after waking up at 7AM. I need to wake up that early more often. I got more done in a few hours than I have this week. Anyway, in this chapter we get something that I think we've been lacking. PLOT DEVELOPMENT. OH BOY. We also get some suave southern gentleman but we got that before anyway.
I thought the season was about fellowship, family, goodwill toward others and appreciating what one has. Nope. Apparently, it’s just about a particular brand of spoiled, privileged Christians making sure everyone in our multicultural society is constantly reminded that despite the well-known origins of Christmas and its traditions, Christians own the season.

Unfortunately, he's saddled with a lot of problems that were caused by prior administrations for the Broncos. *coughTimTebowcough* Watching the draft, he made a lot of good decisions there, but he will be judged by the outcome of things largely out of his control. Which sucks. I think he is adeptly walking a fine line of distancing himself from the Tebow issue while not completely alienating his fans. You'll see an improved Broncos team this year (thanks to the fact that they kept Orton). And much of that is actually thanks to Elway, so it's already successful. John Fox was a good hire.
The problem isn’t society or “good people” versus “bad people.” The problem is Evil. It’s more powerful than I am. It lives in all of us, and its best lie is to make us believe that we’re the good people.

This shows that the industry does have some sort of a code of ethics, no matter how vague. But many consider this irrelevant, stating that the act of advertising is inherently bad. Usually, the argument is that it makes people buy things they don't really need. That, left to themselves, without the influence of advertising, they wouldn't have bought it. "Mindless consumerism," it's called. The question is, who is to decide what people need, and what they don't? Besides food, clothing, shelter, and basic healthcare, what do people really need?
Is it possible that the Republicans felt bad about that so are going to (pardon my ‘french’) piss off women?

I ordered some extra lean mince, some beef pieces, chicken fillets, boneless pork chops and asked them if they had any SW sausages. They said they didn’t have a license (and SW has stopped any new butchers from getting licenses) but the places that had licenses to begin with, have kept them.
In regards to my spiritual life, I want to make morning devotions a priority. Lately, I’ve just been reading/praying/journalling at the end of the day, however, I want to learn to seek God first. So, morning devotions is a goal this month.

What everyone needs to understand is that the universe is huge and the truth is we know only so little of it. Science has been wrong thousands of times before it can be wrong again but so has christianity. It was at one point that all bibles were in latin and only priests could have them but that is no longer the case. All we can do is believe what we want to believe and live life as we see fit. We will find out once we die what is correct (or we won’t).

Natalia Indrimi, one of the organizers of Wednesday’s event and director of the New York office of Centro Primo Levi, a group dedicated to the history of Italian Jews, said the question of Pius’s role during the Holocaust would be settled only when all papal records of the wartime period were unsealed by the Vatican, which so far has released only some.

The fresh claims are likely to be seized upon by supporters of George Zimmerman who say the teenager launched an unprovoked attack on the neighbourhood watch volunteer moments before Trayvon was shot dead.
The other main reason I have trouble really committing to losing weight is actually very simple: it can be totally alienating. Say what you will, but it is my personal experience that, particularly in my age group, the primary means of social interaction occur over food and drink. Sure, there's the old, "soda water and lime" trick, but if you've ever actually tried it, you probably know that one of two things is likely to happen: 1) while you're gettin' fizzed, everyone else is getting buzzed, having a great time and giving you the stabbies because, who knew? drunk people are annoying as all hell; or 2) someone catches onto your little trick, and the next thing you know there is an ACTUAL vodka soda sitting on the table in front of you, not to mention a plate of nachos and queso dip staring you down from 2 chairs away. Peer pressure is real, yo.

Saturday, I had a facial in the morning at a beauty school in Scottsdale and she did a really good job and for CHEAP!! My skin was sooo dry. She asked me early on if I was claustrophobic and I didn't think I was until she started to put this gauze on my face and then started to apply some crazy heavy mask.. I kind of had a mini-panic attack and she had to stop!! I guess I"m more clautrophobic than I thought!!
DSG eschews diplomacy as a viable alternative in favor of a military response to international tensions with a reduction in the need for ‘boots on the ground’ while relying on an increase in a leaner, meaner new generation of remote-powered guilt-free drones, the weapon that Ron Paul suggests are unconstitutional, and more agile, flexible Special Op troops.
One of the interesting things I saw that day was the Oregon Duck out of his costume. We were walking to meet up with one of my brother's friends and we walked by Oregon's cheerleaders and I saw this guy with them carrying a big green bag so I have to assume that inside that bag was the costume. I mean what else could have been in such a large bag that was being carried by a shorter guy?

In the case of your computer, you can try to close some programs to slow things down, get the priorities straightened out. That is the healthy way to deal with it. The worst thing you can do, in a fit of frustration and confusion is a cold shut down - turn it off - pull the plug. After you have done that you have run the risk that you can't get your computer back. It could be gone forever.

The surprising thing about Lonely Island is that for a comedy act, they make pretty good music. This song, mocking the OTT love songs poor Michael Bolton has sung through out his career, deserves this spot for two reasons. One, it really is an incredibly crafted song with great raps from Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone. Two, Michael Bolton sings the line ” This whole town’s a pussy waiting to get fucked”. Every time I hear it, I begin to howl. See, in order to become cool, dear sir, you had to get away from the “Time, Love, And Tenderness” bullshit and be freaking hilarious. Now back to the good part.

Like you, I read the trades and insider blogs. I see the stories about an industry in chaos, its people on the take. And I think to myself: lucky me, I don’t view it that way. Advertising has rough seas. What business doesn’t? But if you are on a good boat with sound crew and deft leadership it’s an adventure. I feel that way and it changes everything: my demeanor, my heart and even my soul. Work is life and that is the carrot.

My friend, Betty, and I attended the opening reception of the 2012 Florida Artists Exhibition held at Santa Fe College in Gainesville, FL on Friday night. The exhibition, the fourth annual statewide competition sponsored by the Gainesville Fine Arts Association, awarded a total of $2,000. Dr. Jack King, Professor of Art at the University of Tampa, juried in 42 pieces of artwork from a total of 212 entries. I was surprised and excited to have my fiber art piece "Widow of Kropa" awarded Best of Show.
I don't wish to distract either the reader or myself by the adventures of John Watkins Holden (1844-1917), Imperial prestidigitateur - I've taken a small liberty here in calling him "Jack" - so if you wish to read more of him, please visit Old Crone's fascinating account of The Mad Magician. Suffice to say, he was a man of many talents, not the least of which were a keen sense of self-aggrandisement and a tendency to accrue wives and children.
Although new uncertainties are introduced by the court's evocation of "objective standards" for such inherently subjective criteria as "recklessness" and "reasonableness," I trust that judicial wisdom will come to show the way, in the common-law tradition. The standards of behavior by which a possible infringer evaluates adverse patents should be the standards of fair commerce, including reasonableness of the actions taken in the particular circumstances. It cannot be the court's intention to tolerate the intentional disregard or destruction of the value of the property of another, simply because that property is a patent; yet the standard of "recklessness" appears to ratify intentional disregard, and to reject objective standards requiring a reasonable respect for property rights.
Although he was exposed to the drug pushers and the street life, he still completed his education, gained an average job and tried to establish himself in the economic world. Still having a love for poetry and rap music Siege recognized that he had a great talent and should put it to good use. “Being exposed to music by great emcees such as NAS, Killer Priest, Rakim, Black Thought from the Roots, KRS One, Busta Rhymes, The Wu Tang Clan and Dr. Dre just to name a few, tends to have an effect on you over a period of time” He said.

It’s really expensive to go to Greece right now. My mother made me check. I called up the local travel agency. The girl was really nice. She was all excited for me and everything. You’re getting married in Greece? That is so romantic! Right? I don’t know what my mother’s problem is. So we decided to wait for a little bit until the prices come down. I can’t believe my mother told me to check. She is so mean to me.

Anyhow, I see these variety packs of beers and wonder if their contents are somehow made up of factory rejects and product that’s past its shelf life. I don’t know that I’ve ever purchased one of these variety “theme” packs myself, but my dear bride brings them home to me from time to time and I’ve recently determined that by and large, the contents are usually of good quality and within their reasonable shelf life, based mainly on my having checked a few of the beers that actually have dates on them. With this in mind, I suppose I’ll be more apt to buy these variety packs myself from now on.

We’ve settled on a variety of methods for toilet paper replacement, by the way. Most of us use corn cobs as a first line of defense, typically followed by a soft cotton cloth. The cloths are discarded into a bucket and carefully washed two or three times a week. Washing them is not a pleasant job, that’s for sure. But, it’s become a part of the new normal. After the initial gut-wrenching reaction, pretty much everyone has taken the absence of toilet paper into stride.

This made me realise that a good (home)brewer wasn't just someone who had a good idea about what might make a good beer, but that they also had a good understanding of the processes that will get you there. A good beer isn't just a good recipe - it's also about the execution of it, and the ability of the brewer to manipulate all the variables in that process, from set-up, through brewing, to clean-up, from the ingredients arriving, to the beer leaving in small or large pack. It's not just about the recipe - its about every step of the way, all the way back to the set-up and purchase of the brewery.

I have no regrets about anything. That's a life philosophy. More than that, it's a driving force. It's something I owe to me, my dad, and to what I've done. No regrets.

There is plenty of time later to edit...honest.

I don’t know about anyone else but when I was in middle school and high school (circa 2001-2008) sending chain letter was the thing to do. I used to get the same letter from countless friends over and over and truth be told unlike some people, I loved them. I could sit for hours and read each letter and relate it to my life. Although I am not sure if I ever received “The List” in a chain letter, reading it now makes me think of all the things I have to buy and do in my life before I turn 30 (just eight short years).
After this they return Ao to his grandfather’s house which has been set ablaze, but even so he still tells Ao not to hate them, leading to him grabbing a photo of his mother and making his decision.

But how can a man achieve self-knowledge, that is taught in their own way, without the interference of various false teachers of suspicious intellectual background, which aim is not to teach its students to think with their own heads, but instead to adapt their imposed instructions and often disrupted norms of our daily society.

Now, let me emphasize that more cases of breast cancer occur in women with ABSOLUTELY NO FAMILY HISTORY. That being said, having a familial pattern does greatly increase your risks. Oh, and don’t think if your mother and her family line are cancer free you are off the hook. Men also carry the presently known inherited genetic mutations that greatly increase the risk of breast cancer. These mutations occur in tumor suppressor genes that we all have and are commonly referred to as the BRCA 1&2 genes. The fact that mutations in these genes can be passed down from our fathers is something I didn’t know before I got cancer. Moreover, it’s not just breast cancer in your family tree that raises your risk…if there is colon, ovarian or prostate cancers amongst your relatives all can indicate the genetic link for an elevated risk of breast cancer occurrence too.

I’m also fortunate to work with a company called PasTest – a medical publisher that publishes test prep materials for qualified doctors who are taking their professional exams (FRCP, FRCS, etc.).

PasTest know that their customers don’t have time to waste and don’t have time to wait for books once they have been ordered.

I suspect that Pujols will soon have a stretch of hitting awesomeness that will blow the mind and once again remind America that he is Albert Pujols. And everyone will say, 'OK, Albert's as great as ever.' But it might not be that easy. I have this theory about age. Remember the McDonald's commercials about the McDLT which kept the "hot side hot and the cool side cool?" Jason Alexander was in one of those commercials. Anyway, I think that one thing that happens with age is that the hot side loses some of it's heat, and the cool side gets a little colder. I've been convinced that streaks and slumps are largely illusions of time and chance, but they still happen. The month Albert Pujols just had -- with a .265 on-base percentage -- was simply not a possibility for a 25-year-old Pujols, not over a 100 plate appearances.
I wore this outfit on christmas day, this gorgeous dress fits me like nothing fits me and the color is just amazing. YES I should've ironed it MOM but I didn't 'cause I'm a lazy mofo. I'll wrinkle it again anyways. We made kilo's of sushi and chocolate mousse which was so good (we ate sushi the day after that too *drools*), watched 'The muppet christmas carol' and exchanged our little gifts. I got 'The Lion king' from my boyfriend which was incredibly sweet. I have been talking about buying some disney movies for a while now and we always sing songs from 'the lion king' and steal quotes from it so it was a lovely start to what will undoubtably be a big collection of my favorite childhood movies. The first movies that come to mind when I think of awesome disney, besides 'the lion king', are definitely 'the rescuers' (both of them), 'Robin Hood', 'Aladdin', 'the fox and the hound', 'The hunchback of the notre dame', 'The little mermaid'... man, I'm probably forgetting loads of them, I totally forgot how much I love all of these movies. I'll probably cry my eyes out when I see them again, it's been at least 8 years or so since I've seen most of them. Simpler times, sniffles. Anyways, I got him a Christopher Hitchens book, he was a brilliant writer and a great thinker. Here lovelies, the last outfit post in 2011 (but not the last outfit from 2011!).
Asian business is starting to make an appearance in the shire towns, in the form of curry restaurants, Asian shops or small businesses, and, even in the shire towns overseas qualified doctors are cutting swathes through the elderly population.

Having dealt firsthand with the brutal effervescence of the music industry, Murray could have easily followed what those before him have done and succumbed to a life of playing music in noisy pubs to uncaring crowds.

Collective responsibility in any democratic society is borne by all citizens. Citizens are obliged to be informed about the issues affecting their society, their country. Political leaders are voted into office by the citizenry, they are therefore “popular representatives”, and in any democracy, through the power of the vote, the people, and civil society, have the ability to send them home if they disagree with the way that they govern the country. It is difficult, therefore, for the people to evade the collective responsibility that they allowed the country to be governed by two political parties, which had the support of the vast majority of the electoral body, resulting in the economic and moral meltdown of today. In fact, one can argue quite credibly that the moral bankruptcy preceded the economic bankruptcy in Greece.

All of us in this world have experienced the winter seasons of life. (Rest assured, if you haven’t yet, you will.) A bright, sunny and warm situation has grown cold and dull. A once lush, green outlook has somehow given way to the fallen leaves of expectation and disappointment. Maybe a single event has brought about this change or perhaps it’s been a series of micro-changes that has left us feeling lifeless, blah and ‘leafless’! We oftentimes cannot describe what we feel during these times; we just know it doesn’t feel good. We long for something brighter, something better, we want what we ONCE HAD. Traversing the seasons of life is normal. Experiencing the growth and excitement of spring, the warmth and happiness of summer, the cooling temperatures and beautiful changes of autumn or even the dormancy of a cold winter is how God intended it to be. If you’re currently experiencing a winter season in your life, realize first, you are NOT ALONE and second, SPRING IS COMING!

I do want to mention however that we took time to film AND he had the "help" of my daughter while he worked. Without distractions, I think the house could be set up in about 40-45 minutes.
His campaign goal is to raise $17,000 dollars and as of 445 pm on Monday Feb 28, he has raised $10,000 with 389 donations and has served 500 people! The donations started by one giver, Scott Harrison, on 2/27/11 and the rest of the donations were given today.
Viewers who saw the light always reported the same thing: the light flared up way down the track, crept towards the observer, then speeded up and began swinging side-to-side. Finally, the light stopped abruptly, hovered for a minute, retreated back to where it started from and vanished. The light always appeared three feet above the left rail, facing east. It was sometimes so distinct that you could see the metal guards of a railroad hand lantern. The light didn’t appear every night. It seemed to appear randomly according to old Joe’s whims.
Take your time on coming up with a good title for your story and a good cover. If you plan on writing a series, think about branding and how or what links your stories together. Here are some examples:

Reading Mortlock is like listening to My Chemical Romance: good and gothic. If any of you have heard them, which I doubt- my kook friend turned me onto them- then you will know that they are pretty...goth. Good, but goth. Mortlock is like that, stylish, stunning writing, sophisticated plot and its completely addictive. Just Mortlock is better, because its a book. I would also like to add another addition of winning points to the almost full bucket: there are twins in this book. As I'm a twin, I can relate to the way Josie felt. I shall talk more about that later. But the point is its awesome.

Having a renewed sense of purpose has really lifted my spirit. I continue to hear from people whose lives have been changed for the better because of what I’ve written. I am amazed and humbled whenever I hear that, and it reminds me each time how important it is to share the truth of God’s love as I see it. I know I’m not alone, but not many are speaking out. I have the privilege of being heard, so I must continue to speak. And maybe it is time for that book.
Today I received a parcel. It was delivered to my doorstep. I was so excited as I had entered the "It's a Total Surprise" RABCK in bookcrossing and thought it would be ages before I received my parcel. Imagine my delight on opening it to find a bevy of gifts from "grovalskii", my bookcrossing partner in this RABCK.

The issue will now be over the scope and breadth of the injunction that courts are prepared to grant. The ECJ has recognized that this is a matter for national law, but it remains to be seen whether Member States will apply this in a consistent manner.
On paper, my competitor has a pretty significant advantage over me. Arian Foster could outscore both of my running backs combined. Tom Brady is a slightly better fantasy quarterback than Matt Stafford. His three wide-outs are slightly better than mine. Usually, I would put the odds on the Jets outscoring the Lions (given the match-ups for each defense); however, the Lions have the edge if both Ponder and Peterson do not play (and it is highly likely that both player sit this one out).
Now, I would like to introduce you all to Esme of Chocolate & Croissants. I have got to know Esme for a few months now, she is not a beader! She loves to cook, she loves to read, she loves to travel, she loves cats and she loves everything French. I have got some great tips on cooking and books to read from her, so I am glad I am able to give her something in return.
On a lesser note, we got back results from her other biopsies showing that she does have a condition called Eosinophilic Esophagitis...basically what I know is that something is causing these Eosinophil cells which are like white blood cells to form around the base of her esophagus...it can be dangerous, and is what's causing her to have GERD, or her extreme reflux. It's usually caused by an allergy to something. I don't know what kind of road we are going to be on trying to fix this condition...for now, she is on yet one more medication...

According to 2 Corinthians 5:14–21, God’s mission is to glorify himself through the reconciliation of all things—humanity and creation—to a right relationship with him through Christ Jesus. Christ is the hope of the world, and the church is to be the instrument by which that hope is made manifest (Ephesians 3:10). The church’s role in the mission of God assumes a relationship with those who are either not yet or not fully reconciled to God. A fundamentalist lens distorts the mission of God from reconciling all things to himself to avoiding those people,and those aspects of culture, that are not living and believing rightly.
If it were to be said that the fashion industry is just playing with women's insecurities, isn't it the same industry that is targeting people who hides behind their computer monitor, commenting under a pseudonym and living sad, lonely lives. The same people who buys their clothing from piles of clothes in bargain stores, not realizing that the pile of clothes comes from the same people working in sweatshops in third world countries.

We were shown around by a lovely guy whose name escapes me but I do remember he didn’t mind us dripping all over the floor! We got the full VIP treatment and learnt all about the brewing process, smelt and tasted various roasted grains and hops and took lots of pictures of large pieces of machinery; a good time was had by all. Then, we were asked “Would you like to try some?” to which I responded with something like “Is it raining outside?” or “Does the pope wear a silly hat?”. So, we tried some. And then, we tried some more. It rained outside. We tried a little more. It rained some more.
After months of talking about it, Stéphane ended up buying a tablet computer (running Android) for my birthday, and couldn't wait for the actual day to give it to me so I've already had a week to play with it. It's super fun and will be definitely useful when we go on vacation (or when I do my stage in October, yay!). We haven't let Fry play with it as he's totally in a throwing toys period, but I reckon eventually he'll have a go since he's pretty much mastered the full sized PC already.
It is the job of a free press to inform the public of a candidates position, ideas, theories, and any relative information essential to making an informed choice. It is especially important if the media that is supporting the candidate is misrepresenting or fabricating facts in order to support their candidate or disparage another.
In this hilariously candid debut novel from comedian Aaron Karo—who grew up with a few obsessions and compulsions of his own—very bad things are going to happen to Chuck. But maybe that’s a good thing. Because with graduation looming, Chuck finds himself with one last chance to face his inner demons, defend his best friend, and win over the girl of his dreams. No matter what happens, though, he’ll have to get his hands
Not your average acceptance speech, I know, but it’s necessary to mention this came after host James Corden appeared on stage with the line: “I can’t believe I’m about to cut off… I’m so sorry”. Yes, you heard correctly. The six-Grammy award winning, 14x platinum album selling, worldwide superstar Adele couldn’t finish her speech.
Forest City Ratner has heavily promoted the 2250 units of subsidized housing in the Atlantic Yards project, and that's been cited as a public use by two courts. However, there's no money available for it right now, more than a half year after a city official cited a "crisis" in the provision of affordable housing bonds.

I mean, the 'solution' to Wonder Woman, is NOT to have a writer with an understanding of mythology, is not to possibly be having her fighting the paranormal, (couldn't ever be as much as I would dislike it personally, to tap into the HUGE Paranormal Romance and Twilight crowd with a truly kick arse heroine), it's NOT to have writer and artist capable of mixing in a little 'Percy Jackson & The Olympians' or 'Harry Potter' - the whole child of legend and secret hidden worlds and battles the rest of mankind never knows about.

The main force of Polish Paratroopers take on the two remaining German platoons in the wood. Note the attacking Polish formation is one battalion up front supported by the second battalion behind for big morale bonus in BCG rules (see top left below). The flanking Polish Paratrooper battalion uses the hill as cover to push on and threaten the main objective of the depot/town (see bottom right below). Also, note the three suppressed (top right below, units with yellow markers on them) recon platoons getting out of the way of the paratroopers after suffering accurate indirect fire. Good job they were in half-tracks to out-retreat the advancing Poles is all I can say. Footnote: See a Polish mortar platoon (bottom left below) lagging behind the main battalion body, a dangerous position to be in when an attack can come from any direction.
"It’s chicken my friend and I always carry it with me. You know why?"
In lieu of my travels back to Canada for summer holidays (I am actually on the plane as I write this), I actually whipped up these protein bars to get me through the long trip across the Atlantic. Airport and plane food be damned, this tasty little snack is most certainly keeping my fork out of the freaky mini-meal in front of me (how DO they manage to make fruit salad taste like a science experiment every single time?). In fact, I will be so bold as to say that these are the must-have snack for summer - delicious, filling, packed with whole foods. Best of all, Hemp Protein Granola Bars are perfect for road trips, picnics in the park, days at the beach, forest hikes, or lazing in hammock with a frosty glass of lemonade. They even freeze beautifully, so make a double batch, cut them up and pop in the freezer for smart snacking all summer long – just take them out half and hour before munching! So easy.

In case any of you forgot (or didn't know), I'm damn short. 5'1". Usually I stop towering over people by the time they hit the double digits. I actually have to be mindful of where I write on the board because Soon-mi might not be able to reach it at all. Photos of starving children in Africa are horrible and touching, yes, but something about a grown woman barely coming up to my shoulders is way more personal.
Without this ingenious cooking tool my family would go hungry on busy nights.
Honestly, I really don't remember what it tastes like. We are doing the beers around the world at Allyn's Cafe and you have to drink them all. I would bet that I didn't care for it all that much, since I don't usually like the German Hefeweisen's.
Taste – Bright and flavorful, lead by mixed citrus, bright pineapple, dried Granny Smith apple, startfruit and yellow grapefruit. Beneath these, hints of acacia, subtle white pepper and flint give the wine a subtle complexity.

He rolled his eyes and shook his head at the giddy commerce of it all, purse lipped at the repeat runs to the C&C, a case of wine clanking ostentatiously, so removed from the usual mere bottle of scotch rolling around in the boot. The wanton repetition, “They drink on a Tuesday. AND a Wednesday!” (Imagine.)
Sometimes I find that a lack of inspiration is my body’s way of telling me that I need to get out and do something active. Get out into the sunshine, go socialize and otherwise get some experiences to add to my imagination’s toolbox. It’s been especially sunny recently, and I spent a good part of the day out in it yesterday with a friend. It was wonderful. Sometimes your brain just needs a rest. On the other hand, sometimes I take my project to another medium–in this case, I take the characters from my story and draw them. It helps me get away from the main activity but still keeps me focused on the concept, and once I’m done I feel inspired again to go write about what I’ve just drawn.

purposed for fear to control us in any such manner. Fear does not come from God; it is a tool of the enemy of our soul. And our faithful Lord has provided all we need to defeat it. “Be strong and of good courage,” He calls to us. “Do not fear nor be afraid.” Why? Because there is NOTHING in our lifetime that we will ever have to face on our own. The Lord our God, He is the One who goes with us, who stands with us, who fights for us, and who carries us when we are too weak to stand.

What's for dinner? Roast goose of course! Hong Kong is know for Dim Sum and roast goose. My mom always told me how she remembered my Grandpa/her dad brought a roast goose home from his visit to Hong Kong. She remembers it vividly how it was still warm (Hong Kong is just a 2 hour fight from Vietnam), and juicy, and meat being fragrant and the skin melting in her mouth; savoring every bite as they had the goose for dinner that day. With so many places to eat how do you know who's the best. Luckly, Jacky the executive chef of Wild Ginger (where I work) is a native of Hong Kong. He suggested Yung Kee. So Yung Kee it is.....

Me & my mom:
I'm in a strange place right now with a number of new and old friendships. I have more of a social life at the moment since I was in college, because my colleagues seem to genuinely like spending time with each other (either that or they've really got nothing better to do with themselves on a Friday night!) and despite my best efforts to be socially awkward and bastardizing their language, they keep inviting me out. I'm in the awkward position of trying to be just the right mix of myself and reserved (which isn't me at all, I have to really fight for this) but that seems to be how the French do it. You sit politely, listening. Then a few weeks later maybe you comment. Then a few months later you might be the one making the joke or entertaining the table with a story. I have to remember that I'm not there yet with most of these people, and to walk before I run. They don't have to accept me with all of my crazy for any particular reason, so I have to remind myself to slowly release the crazy over time, and by then the friendships will be forged and my intensity should seem less obvious.

10:00 – Awake (NBC): Britten and Bird size up a possible case of gang violence. Before long, clues from Britten’s parallel realm force him to give the case a harder look. Elsewhere, Hannah offers a helping hand to Rex’s girlfriend; Capt. Harper can’t fulfill a promise; and Vega puts Britten’s going-away party into motion. Fun fact: I will never give this show a try. Sorry, Awake.
I remember the second time I saw this, realizing that the reason for this movie is to make love to Bergman’s luminous, youthful face. As Ilsa Lund, she and her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) unknowingly enters her ex boyfriend’s namesake bar Rick’s (Bogart). Repeat viewings shed light on the familiar, also showing her maturity at 27, when actresses today don’t get taken seriously until they’re 31. She’s the most beautiful actress to beg Bogart for something and simultaneously break his heart. Acting wise she does all the work while Bogart, for what seems to be the first time in his career, is cool and collected. But somehow these opposite acting strategies work together. And as I’ve said before, he looks good here, blissfully enjoying Paris during the flashbacks.

Rectangular shape reduces can be a contact unique from the most well-known round-brilliant decreased nevertheless features a lot of the very same abilities. If you need to take a step somewhat unique from your spherical cut, the rectangle cut is a amazing alternative. It can be even now an amazingly traditional cut, but can be additional unique when in comparison to spherical cut.The rectangle cut unique rock has rectangle-shaped locations, and makes for a very awesome unique rock. The rectangle-shaped locations are bigger and type opinions that really show off the beauty of the precious rock. Without the cautious accurate cut locations of the rectangle overall look, your unique rock isn’t just a small piece of rock. The unique rock becomes something unique and awesome.
Grammar: A wise old owl once told me to start grammar in third grade. Honestly, there's enough going on in the earlier years with learning just the basics of reading and writing. Oh sure, I probably doled out little grammar bits here and there, but nothing substantial. I use the Daily Grams and Easy Grammar workbooks, which I've found to be quick and easy for my kids to do on their own. They're also effective--there is that. For learning parts of speech, I pull out our Mad Libs books. How else would we learn that "fart" can be both a noun and a verb?

I just wanted to share this latest project with you - it's been gestating for the past two months as my friend and colleague asked me if I'd make her a cosy for her new e-reader - a Sony - when she saw my iPhone cosy. Of course I agreed, and it would be in the same hot pink - but the only caveat was that there wouldn't be any time pressure. Probably a mistake as I am the queen of procrastination and unless I have a deadline I'll put everything off till tomorrow...or next week, or month, or year.
“I am not boring,” I swear to a God neither of us believe in. We get lost in Chapters on green afternoons, comparing books in the Science section for hours. You come up behind me as I’m lost in the back cover, cuddle for just a second and kiss my hair. You hate PDA, but we haven’t touched since your apology, grabbing my face with calloused affection to meet the steel in your eyes. A loosened grip on my jaw as you stroke my hair. You looked at me like I was something amazing then, something you wished to hold gently. And I fell in love with you again.

This is Fanfare by MAC, the very first day I decided to do the lipstick thing. It’s a very pretty mauve-y rose color, and it’s a Cremesheen finish, which gives it the glossy look, and also makes it very moisturizing. It lasts for hours (I’ve never counted how many, though), and it gives a nice finished look to the lips without going overboard on color.

She’s Buffy’s mom, need I say more. Initially the thought was that no parents would be regular characters on Buffy. Fortunately they cast Kristine Sutherland as Joyce and let her appear regularly. This was particularly important during the high school seasons (1-3) where it created both support and conflict for the teenaged Buffy. The end of season two was a particularly strong moment for Joyce’s character, as she appropriately freaked out at the news that her daughter was a superhero. That felt real. Of course Joyce’s fatal stroke was the backdrop for a truly great episode of TV that dealt with loss.

Okay, my first impression in just turning over this card was positive. The red color of the diamonds is energizing and 8 is a strength number and indicate success. And my elbow is getting better; it hurts less with activities since the start of spring and warmer weather. I am strengthening it with Yoga which it seems to agree with more than with pulleys or free weights. The yoga exercises are “closed chain” (physical therapy lingo from my days as a physical therapist) and the elbow and arm are responding slowly but I do see progress which is encouraging. So, the 8 of diamonds could be indicating the success in the present. Diamonds in playing cards relates to the suit of Pentacles (Coins) in the Tarot divination system. Earth, earthy, materiality –that’s the archetype. Hands on earth with yoga postures—that’s one way to interpret the earthiness of the suit of diamonds here and the numerological 8 which relates to strength and success adds to the interpretation. I think the 8 of Diamonds, thus far, confirms what I already know and that is that what I am doing about the issue/problem/question about the elbow is positive. But now, let’s look at what I wrote on this card in the cartomancy class that I took so very long ago. Ha! Well, I wrote “spending money”. Well, I did buy a new yoga mat to do my yoga outside and a while back an elbow brace. Let me look at the hand out to see if there’s more but before I do that, what is money? Energy. So I am spending energy doing yoga. Hmmmmm. Honestly, it says “a marriage and travel late in life. Financial ups and downs.” I don’t know what marriage would have to do with this—I’m happily and contentedly single. Ha ha. I’m going to interpret that “marriage” reference to the marriage of the left and right arm being equal, merging in that respect. Well, the ups and downs part may be a little message to me that there may still be good days and bad days with this elbow discomfort, but overall the progress is positive. When we compare the tarot 8 of Pentacles which is the counterpart to the 8 of Diamonds in that system, we see someone working (image of someone working) on the card. The card is about making efforts and those efforts being rewarded. Sounds good so far. Now, the future prediction… shall we go there? Remember, I want to know if this arm is ever going to be good as new or at least back to the non-injured state (if not better than it was to start with).

The Spanish government has adopted plans to allow private suppliers to recover, by the end of March, between €30bn and €50bn in overdue bills they are owed by Spanish municipalities – a move which is expected to expose the real size of Spain’s public debt. The poorer countries of Southern Europe were only ever in the EU for the massive subsidies they could get out of it. So they have quite a conundrum now. Under the proposed austerity policy "the unemployment rate would rise to well over 25pc with six million out of work by the end of the year".

These flowers I absolutely love, I have had them for a while. I won them years ago at a crop but they had all been taken out of the original packaging and put into a decorated bag so I'm not sure who makes these or if they're still being made. They're a very thin plastic. If anyone knows could you please let me know..I would love to buy more.
Ingrid Bergman was stunningly beautiful as the woman who understandably left Bogart shattered. The cast was top-notch, from the waiters and bartenders at Rick's Cafe Americain to Peter Lorre as a "cut-rate parasite" and Sydney Greenstreet as the owner of the rival club, The Blue Parrot.

As I stated before, the “brilliant” economists at the troika are implementing measures which are counterproductive. Instead of focusing on growth, they are slashing wages, pensions, benefits, government jobs and increasing taxes hoping to restore “fiscal sanity.” All they’re doing is ensuring a Greek and European depression.
In the end, the writer himself indicates that the description and the warning are not talking about true converts when he says, “But, beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany salvation, though we are speaking in this way” (emphasis added, Hebrews 6:9, NASB). The people who fell away and the people who do fall away permanently were never saved in the first place. They did not have those qualities that accompany salvation.

Now, reconstruct the crater. To do this, gently press on the center of the top of the cake, gently pushing the inverted crater down to meet the bottom layer. In this new crater, spread a layer of chocolate buttercream all the way around and to the edge, making sure the buttercream is about 1/4" thick. The crater won't seem as deep or as sharp around the edges, and that's OK.
Surely I don’t need to recount the plot: clanking chains, ghosts, cute kid suffering from mysterious ailment in his leg, a changed life. Dickens gives us London before Christmas became a hugely commercial enterprise (cue Stan Freberg’s Green Christmas).

The killings did not stop after the elections. In fact, crime and violence soared in all provinces of the country at such an alarming rate that temporary ballistic labs were established as a matter of urgency in all provinces, except the Free State. I suppose Nelson Mandela’s decision to release thousands of criminals from jail was a most likely reason why crime soared to new groundbreaking, or should I say revolutionary heights!

Ok, can I just say that I CANNOT believe it's already February (almost) and spring semester is already like 3 weeks in. I know I always say how fast time goes by in my posts....but for real, I am trippin out!!!! So I finally have my emploi du temps all figured out. You may think registering for classes would be slightly easier second semester, since I did it before. No. Pas du tout. It was an excruciating process filled with hours of waiting, confusion, uncertainty and being made fun of for my terrible accent. Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating a little- it wasn't thaaaat bad. I made it out alive! But the disorganization of French...everything...never ceases to amaze me.

Often a facing up can be the result of .... a real, painful Illness. I think, we are very good to shoo off the different unpleasant symptoms, only noticing the Illness, which actually hurts. As people, and I as well, do not like to be ill, thus any illness has a big forcing power to make us to act. It motivates to change. Having pains, depending on pills, limits the life very strongly. So the intention in order to Live again is firm, the will to be free again determines the way ahead of us, makes us to look for cures, healing methods, which after all helps to change our life style - forever.

Saladin Ahmed. However, the ebook is over ten dollars, and I just can’t bring myself to spend that much money on an ebook. I’d rather spring for the hardcover and spend a little bit more. Weird how that works. I’ll probably wait until the price drops in a few months before I read it. But that brings me back to not having a book to read. Any recommendations? I’m up for nearly any genre.

I wonder if it is ok with these expert-types if I'm dependent on anyone at all. Is it ok that I depend on my husband for companionship, financial support, help with raising our children? That I depend on my babysitter to watch my children when I work? That I depend on my siblings for entertainment, for help moving heavy things, and for all kinds of other things? I'm not independent. I depend on many people for many different things. Should I be ashamed of this? Because I'm not.

Your greatest happiness is in loving and being loved. It’s an absolute necessity for you to be emotionally involved. Because of this great need for love, you’re apt to be a very good mate, always adoring, always ready to forgive, as long as your partner shows you the affection you crave. You mustn’t let this love become too overpowering or try to dominate the relationship because it could lead to the loss of all that you seek. Intimacy is extremely important to you and some of your relationships will be based on that alone.
For the label on the tea bag, I used the pen feature for the sentiment "Brewed with Love" in the Funtime font 0helvetica Medium Rhinestone. It's a font I personally like to use when using the pen feature because it thin and simple. No need for special pens for the Gazelle!! She'll take any pen you want to use. For this particular project I used a Zig Memory System 0.5 mm writer. After I removed the pen from my Gazelle, I replaced the blade holder and cut out the shape around the sentiment and attached a string with a staple.

Jen and I headed out for dinner, and we ended up at Phil’s Diner, a little restaurant in our neighborhood that’s both new and very old. The restaurant, which is inside a dining car, dates back to 1926, and served North Hollywood for decades and decades, in a few different locations. Then, 12 years ago, it closed, until an enterprising couple bought it, restored it, and opened it up again in a new location about six months ago.

Meanwhile, I detect a quietly spiralling back-lash of anti American resentment building in this country. We all feel powerless, but as our pension funds dwindle and news reports on the continuing spill vie with the latest deaths of British soldiers in Afghanistan, in what some perceive to be the latest of a series of American oil-inspired wars in the Middle East, the ‘Special Relationship’ begins increasingly to look like a rather one-sided and insubstantial political convenience. Those mid term congressional elections have a lot to answer for.

“Come here,” Reginald said, getting up. He walked over to Bertie and started to clean the top of his head. It’s really quite difficult to get it clean properly, the top of the head, always useful to have a friend nearby for that sort of thing. He gave Bertie’s head a really good and vigorous clean. “That’ll do I suppose,” said Reginald. One couldn’t expect Bertie to manage more than the bare minimum when it came to personal hygiene. “Let’s get going.”

Or perhaps it'll be the cleaner who my wife took on to save me from fretting about the housework I wasn't getting done because I was writing (only I kept getting distracted by the fact that no-one had done the housework). So the cleaner comes once a week to do housework so I can get on with writing, only while she's here I keep getting distracted by her arriving, and then by her wanting to clean the room I'm working in, and then just by the general noises of cleaning...

I have nothing against other races. What I have is hatred towards those who are bent on chipping away at the fundamentals that have been holding this nation together. While the Malays sleep, DAP continues to chip away at their cohesiveness, and spirit of Malayness that we used to see not too long ago; but these values have eroded so much that many do not realise the implications of losing the Special Rights. While I take swipes at what I think is wrong with people in UMNO, I am against any attempt to usurp the power of the Malays through the religion of Islam and the protection of the institution of the Malay Rulers. If Pakatan Rakyat wins 2/3 majority, with DAP being the biggest winner, DAP will be in the position to propose for amendments to the Federal Constitution. The Malay Rulers would have a smaller role, probably similar to what was proposed during the Malayan Union, and would be powerless to even protect the religion of Islam in their respective state.

I’d written a long (about 50-pages) essay summarizing the history of Cinerama and which had incorporated a few bits of new information not published anywhere else. I thought Harvey would like a copy so I gave him one. Some time later two articles by the same author appeared in a magazine called The Perfect Vision. One was a profile of John Harvey, the other was an historical overview of Cinerama. My historical overview of Cinerama. The author didn’t even try to hide his thievery. About 90% of it was word-for-word from my original essay. Obviously he had approached Harvey for an interview, and Harvey had innocently given him a copy of my essay as a reference. I complained to the magazine’s editors and they printed an apology in their next issue, but I never heard from John Harvey again.

Option (E) is, of course, the best answer. The others are nothing but rhetoric. The problem with rhetoric is “that’s all it is”. Rhetoric differs mightily from performance. And rhetoric is not a substitute for performance.
Another option -- for those of us sticking to more conventional human fare -- is to plop a bit of Merrick's Thanksgiving Day Dinner canned dog food onto our dogs' usual food.

Also needed are ways to improve lean flammability in gasoline engines. That is, the ability to burn real lean is limited by the fuel. If the gasoline-air mixture is too lean, the flame will not have enough speed to get across the cylinder in the time permitted by the engine RPM the driver wants, or the flame will not even start – the cylinder misfires, and then the catalyst has to oxidize a huge amount of UHC and thus may overheat (which might mean you have to buy a new catalyst).

I had this meal earlier this week - it was one of those "kitchen sink" type meals where I was trying to use up bits and pieces of things in my fridge, yet make something tasty for dinner. I had black beans and corn to use up, so I took that, added spinach, tomatoes and red onion. I seasoned it with a bit of cumin, lemon juice, and hot sauce (you could easily use a bit of taco seasoning or something instead). I put a fillet of tilapia on top of that mixture, put it in a foil packet and stuck it in the toaster oven for about 25 minutes (I think it would be quicker in a real oven)...just like that - quick, healthy, and tasty!

Remember that I had purchased the lumber for one chair, but we had decided to make another? Well, when it came time to cut the boards for the back of the chair, we didn't have enough of the right size of lumber. This didn't stop my friend. We marched into her house, passed her husband sleeping in the recliner, and into her bedroom. There, I watched with my mouth open as she pushed her bed away from the wall, grabbed a section of baseboard, and ripped it from the wall. Seriously. I could barely suppress my giggles as we tiptoed back to the garage carrying this "reclaimed" piece of lumber. Her husband woke up briefly and asked what we were doing. Her reply: "We just grabbed this from the bedroom." Seriously.
All that said, my next 5k is this weekend. I’m goin this one solo – which is needed I suppose. I can’t depend on other folks to always get me across that finish line.

Because after all – I’m still “lapping the people at home sitting on the couch”. I head out today for the first time in 3 days…and I can hardly wait. Super focused on my time today. Of course, I also need to bear in mind to try and make sure I’m maintaining AT LEAST a 15 minute/mile – as that will greatly help me come October (Marine Corps 10k).

It's not just vaccinations that are believed to cause Autism. Some believe it's genetic and some believe environmental factors are to blame. What I didn't know is that Autism isn't necessarily just a mental disorder. Children suffering from Autism often are extremely ill with horrible diarrhea, up to 10 times a day! As well as problems digesting foods, colon problems, and multiple allergies. There's a symptom called the Leaky Gut and I don't even want to get into that. ;(

Susan Riley adds a valuable perspective on the current war about who started the culture war in Canada. A case can be made, I think, that we Canadians are massively ambivalent about how much moral content we want in our politics. We have prided ourselves on the pragmatism of our politics. Our politicians, especially when two “big tent” parties dominated the scene, prefered to run on issues of competence and integrity rather than on competing visions of the good; mostly they stayed away from deeply divisive issues such as abortion or capital punishment or same-sex marriage unless forced upon them. These were left to the courts and the gradual evolution of Canadian culture. When these big debates did occur, they poked at the seams of our fragile federation and highlighted the profound differences in values that reflect equally profound differences in experience and circumstance across our vast country. We are understandably nervous about values debates and especially debates infused with high moral content.

I guess my basic fear is that I would waste my life. I believe God entrusts us with certain gifts and abilities and we are expected to use those gifts for a redemptive purpose in a broken world. What if there were a wealthy land-owner in Burundi, a country plagued by poverty, who just reaped a massive harvest. He had all this food to do whatever he wanted with. And as he sat in his home he could not figure out what to do with it until he came up with a brilliant idea. He would build many barns and store his food in the barns. What would we say of such a man? We would think him horrible, greedy, and, basically, worthless. Yet don’t we do this very thing with our lives? In this very city there are organizations that could serve the marginalized, oppressed, and impoverished in such dynamic ways, if only they had the volunteers to do it.

“Don’t sound so grateful girl; I only just kept this wave going is all”
Colonel Gaddafi must be feeling like a complete ass. On a recent visit to Italy, he invited 700 call girls to listen to him pontificate on women’s problems and his important role in solving them. In a fit of zealous pride, he urged them to migrate to Libya, boasting that the status of women in his country was an example to the world. The call girls naturally took this to mean that prostitutes earned fabulous rates of pay there, and a dozen or so eager beavers flew to Tripoli to make their fortunes.
7.) This isn't weird but, I would give anything I have for those I love even if I never see them again.
Voila! The finished product. I was quite pleased with what I produced this week. I managed to achieve my final look at only the second attempt. Like last week, this made me feel quite smug. Not only have I learned a new skill, but I've also learned that I have a really nasty competitive streak and will plough over anyone in an attempt to be 'teacher's pet'. This is not a good thing. But I couldn't help but beam with delight when the teacher came round and said, "Perfect. Yellow and purple is one of my favourite colour combinations." My heart skipped a beat and I did a wee dance inside.
Within the first couple of days of my project, I found myself in Philippians 4, but, it was just last week that I saw it for the first time, the “because.”
As I move through this period of grief, and it is grief- even though she is still here, I lose a small part of her every day...I want to write about the things she has said and done which imparted wisdom, laughter, and joy to me from my early years until the present. Even yesterday she made me laugh!
Oh, and I have reached 200 followers! YAY! So, I think I may be having a little joint giveaway with 2 other ladies who have reached this sweet milestone! Details will be here soon!
Eager to find something easy, without having to reinvent the wheel, I googled toddler dress patterns and found this awesome list compiled by Prudent Baby (one of the best sewing blogs in my opinion).
Entry #55
Light was radiant over all: words ceased, for none were needed.
The only problem was that it was dimensional and that would cause problems with writing and drawing in my journal. So I waited....
She doesn’t like the words ‘bucket list’, considers allowing oneself negative thoughts a form of self-defeat and bristles at the implication that it’s time to retire ‘Let’s Get Physical’. “You think it stops now?” she asks, obviously enjoying putting a journalist on the spot. A few minutes later she says, “Someone told me in Sri Lanka that if you’re over forty they think you’re over the hill. Let me tell you, I’m not.” The stage at the Musaeus auditorium is bathed in lights, the instruments stand waiting to be claimed, and somewhere behind us, the audience has already begun to pour in. We’re seated off to the left of the stage – three reasonably star struck journalists sitting down for a few minutes with the evening’s luminary. The question is – have I just succeeded in mortally offending Olivia Newton John, beloved of millions? Probably not, Olivia is far more resilient than one would imagine.
Irony alert: Health care hatred could lead Boehner, McConnell and their cadres into a Pyrrhic victory now just as passage of the reform bill was a turning point in the President's downfall.
H3 is off work now for a little while for a medical condition. It’s not totally serious but it’s also not nothing either. When we were together he was off on medical leave just before he left his job to go to the Home Improvement store where he ultimately met his ‘work wife’, AKA Slut Girlfriend.
We have just entered the second silicon revolution which will be transformed in the next decade or so with unstoppable solar energy superceding our dependency on fossil fuels for electricity and reducing global CO2 emissions. The only unanswered question is how many entrepreneurs will soon become solar billionaires.
But before then, there’s still one more post for AtoZ and the First Loves Blogfest on May 14th, so YAY!
To show how tough roses can be, this is the Davis Austin rose, ‘St. Swithun’. It’s a baby that I put in the ground a couple of weeks ago along with ‘Mary Rose’. No damage at all. Plus, two days before the freeze I planted ‘Graham Thomas’. No damage to him either. Normally, I would place a nursery pot over tender plants, but I forgot this time. Good thing they’re tough. But wait. They’re also not Tea roses which are tender as roses go. It makes a difference which baby rose you leave out unprotected.
An authorial aside at the onset of the recounting of Hans Castorp's bed-rest establishes that henceforth the treatment of time will be telescoped, that much more time will be compressed into a shorter space of narrative. Hans' regular sick-bed regime is described. It is noted that the division of his his days into an unchanging pattern makes them seem shorter, but also makes it seem as if time is not passing at all. Joachim urges Hans to write a letter alerting his relations to the extension of his stay. Hans has some trouble bringing himself to write, but puts himself to it when his three weeks are up and the issue can no longer be avoided. Hans reveals as as little as possible, suggesting that he has been only briefly detained by a bad cold. This becomes part of a pattern of uncovering his true state only gradually, as we learn when he discloses, a week and a half later in a conversation with Settembrini, that he has he has written a second latter attributing further delay to mere suspicion about the condition of his chest. Castorp reveals to Settembrini his increasing alienation from his accustomed bourgeois society as a result of the perspective brought on by illness. Settembrini, alarmed anew, resumes his chiding. He first relates skeptical anecdotes about the diagnoses and cures of the doctors, and then launches a frontal assault on Hans' view that death and disease provide distance from and perspective on ordinary life. At the end of three weeks, Behrens releases Hans from bed rest, but only after he has been reminded -- he seems to have lost track of how long Hans has been confined.
Old washcloth
In secondary school I felt caught up in the apparent sudden backlash against ANZAC Day and the argument from the Left that the day was less a commemoration and more a glorious celebration of war, white men and the subjugation of women. I know I learned the ‘moratorium’ from driving past anti-war graffiti in the city. This was followed (seemingly overnight but I’m sure the years have dimmed the accuracy of the memory) by a groundswell of fervent devotion as the public came to realise that the last of the original Diggers would soon disappear. It was as if a switch had been flicked and it became something of a pleasant duty to attend a commemorative dawn service on ANZAC Day.
Generative ‘mash-ups’ of data and the vast array of tools and APIs available for processing them mean it is increasingly trivial to find answers to questions such as ‘where was person x on date y’. And the answers will increasingly be coming from the general public, not from government or corporate surveillance.

It just made me stop and think about each type.
To start with something, I implemented the display first. It used 8 bits to drive both digits, 4 bits for display. In addition the board needs power, so it has 10 wire ribbon cable. The connector is standard ribbon cable two row connector, so to use it with breadboard it needed little breakout board to separate those rows.

And in the worth-the-wait department, I consider myself three for three as well. I haven't yet seen Mendoza's previous feature, the graphically violent and controversial Kinatay—for which he won the Best Director award at Cannes last year, and for which he inspired the ire of an especially offended Roger Ebert—but Lola, more often than not, harks back to his wonderful 2008 film Serbis in the way it mixes a tough-minded economic critique with empathy and affection for its characters.
(Does this mean that Hill never made any submissions at all? Not quite. One client, whose submission package had supposedly been sent to nine publishers, discovered that three had actually received it. Since her work was not appropriate for their lists, all three had rejected without comment. According to the reports she got from Hill, however, those submissions--as well as the fictional ones--were still under consideration.)

As for the post title? I figured it was a logical step to match three traditional beer drinkers to their land of origin and, to this end, I convinced three mates to join me in selecting, presenting and drinking these fine beers. James Smith (The Crafty Pint, The Age and father of Good Beer Week) agreed to represent England even though he was born in Scotland and often secretly curses his father for moving the family from Fife before he had the chance to craft a fine Scottish accent.

Ron mentioned something at this juncture that I wrote down: "Harmonious bitterness." It's a German term, he explained, a blending and coming together of the hop notes in the aroma, the bitterness, the kettle hops and aroma additions, creating a whole that is, for him -- and for me, now -- the pils experience, a beer gestalt.

Witchcraft refers to the use of certain occult and spiritual practices to seek the assistance of the supernatural powers in resolving the problems whose solutions can not be achieved through the known rational means. The process involves reciting prayers and performing rituals in a certain specific format or craft. Prayers and rituals when performed with utmost sincerity and faith do quite often fructify into the desired results. Since there is no reasonable explanation for the manifestation of the result, they are termed miracles or magic. Witchcraft is therefore considered synonymous with magic.

I will admit that I have never been that much of a rock fan. I grew up during the hair band days. I listened to pretty tame bands – Bon Jovi, Poison, and a bit of Guns and Roses and Motley Crue to jazz it up a bit. I was more a person who listened to pop music. It had to have a beat and I had to be able to dance to it. I also enjoyed listening to soundtrack music. That's right, soundtrack music. The music in the background of the movies. If you listen to enough of them, you are able to distinguish who it is. Williams or Barry. Doyle or Jablonsky. They each have a singular style. It was my belief and I still hold to it, that soundtracks are the new symphonies. No one goes and writes long pieces of music anymore. They all write quick tunes that are able to fit into a 5 minute video (if that long). But soundtracks can go on for a while. They are meant to express the feelings that are not vocalized by the characters or to set the mood. I mean, you really can't forget the music of Jaws and not get a little scared while you are swimming in the ocean or even in the lake.

The soul, also invisible, is the very essence of our life. In the same way, the Holy Spirit is the very essence of the life of God. It is the Spirit of God that was breathed into Adam to give him life, and it is the Spirit of God who gives new life to the believer. “The Spirit of God has made me; the breath of the Almighty gives me life.” Job 33:4 (NIV).

About 20 minutes from downtown Portland is the Columbia River Gorge, a temperate rainforest cut by a spacious, fast moving slab of brown river and sided by gargantuan waterfalls tumbling between pine tree cliffs; the terrain gets drier as you drive east on Hwy 84 till eventually it turns into endless rolls of dry farmland. And this region, a mere 150 miles out of liberal Portland is cowboy country, where everyone drives tank-sized pick up trucks that are graced with bumper stickers that say things like "Obama bin lyin'."
Abu Hamza is in the news because MP’s are visiting him in prison to consult with him would you believe. I personally don’t care what he has to say.

I hope that all of you out there in my Blogger community are doing well! I still read your posts, and keep up with your stories and your lives. And I hope some of you continue to enjoy my work through RecoveryNowTV. Much love to all. I may still post here occasionally, so this is not good-bye or anything like that...just a change of venue, I guess! This blog is what got me started writing again, and I think that through this blog I began to grow as a writer, a blogger, and a member of the recovery community. I began to realize the power being the world wide web recovery community, and this blog has catapulted me to a whole new level, as a writer and as a person. I did so much since I started this blog, like finishing school and writing a book. I think when I first started Hashish Dreams and Heroin Nightmares, I did not have the confidence to go out there and do things like that. But when I started telling my story, things began to change. I want to thank all of you because your words of encouragement were one of the first signs that I was on the right path. The friendships I gained through this blog, and the advice, and words of encouragement gave me the confidence I needed to take the leap of faith into writing, telling my story. And this blog became a stepping stone to a whole new world for me. A whole new career. A whole new life. Thank you all.

But I digress. It’s not totally hopeless to locate a few open gates that'll lead to fine hunting without draining the bank. Knowing where to start and how to approach folks about hunting their property are the biggest keys. In Florida, though they sit on a gazillion acres of game-rich property, phosphate giant Mosaic and anything with Ben Hill Griffin’s name on it probably won’t get you far. The former doesn’t care much for hunting and potential lawsuits, while the latter limits their property to only family, friends, and guests. The thing to do is search small and work from there.

It is odd not being a writer any more, for the moment. I am wandering around a bit aimlessly, feeling blank. A writer has to be someone who writes…not someone who thinks about it.
My advice to step parents is to make sure you know what you’re getting into before you get into it. Understand that it is a lot of work. Sometimes it’s not the kids who have the problem blending but the parents involved. Make sure that you’re marrying someone who’s not going to be jealous when their child/children bonds with the step parent. Don’t confide in the children and trash the step parent. Be responsible with the blended family. Let kids be kids! In my case it ended up well as my relationship with Tracy thrives to this day and she was the example of how I knew I wanted to be with my step daughter Xearia.

Most people in the United States have a hard time understanding the sorrow of the Korean people and the Western media spent the better part of the past few days ridiculing this mass display of grief. After all, it’s inconceivable to imagine the death of any U.S. leader – President or otherwise – eliciting unanimous mourning from the American people. Nevertheless, even the harshest critics could not deny the sincerity of the tears shed by the Korean people, both in the DPRK and abroad, on the morning of Dec. 19.
Alycia understands those concerns and works with her clients to help define their style and to incorporate what they already own into the design (if they want!). She can design an entire room in the time it might have taken you just to choose one lamp, rug, or fabric! She's got several design packages to choose from, but can also create a custom plan. Go HERE to see her design packages. Also, you can request a 20-minute phone consultation before you decide to hire her, which I think is awesome because it gives you a chance to see if y'all are a good fit first!

The living room sofa is ring side seating for watching the fun through our garden door! Sometimes there are one or two robins splashing around with a small chickadee joining in the fun. Other times there is a line up on the apple tree above, as each bird takes a turn. Often, we have to go out and refill the bath in the middle of the chaos so that the next birds have some water to splash around in as the previous ones have made quite a mess sloshing about! It's fun to watch them fly up into the apple tree afterwards, to dry off and preen themselves. Most of them rub their wet beaks on the branches, either to dry them off, or sharpen them, or both!

After enduring several hours of non-linear storytelling and self-conscious auteur posing, along comes this simple but affecting documentary about a rural craftsman who makes a traditional Iranian percussion instrument called daf. All able-bodied family members participate in the production, including a blind son, whom we see hitching a ride to market with his sister to purchase the sheep skins and wood planks used in the instrument’s manufacture. A doctor visits the father’s younger 3-1/2 year-old son, who has also lost his eyesight, and offers this advice: “Pray to God. Give to charity. Have ceremonies and have a dervish play the daf for him.” The greater part of the film focuses on the laborious work involved in the fabrication of daf and culminates in a rousing ritual for the ailing boy. The accomplished camerawork takes advantage of the surrounding scenery and local color. Sensitive individuals are warned of a brief but graphic segment of sheep being slaughtered. The image benefits from a solid transfer, with brilliant color and clarity. (5/10)

Well, I believe that Owen has done a wonderful job in staying faithful and Christ-centered (even though we're both HORRIBLE potty mouths), and why shouldn't Owen be happy with who he is, and let God work with that? After all, I compare it to Jim turning down girls who weren't good enough for him, even though I saw them as women who would really love him. He found someone HE wanted. You see?

Edna Fedya is like a little slice of Osbourn Village that's been transported to the U of Manitoba campus. It contains the same cozy and energetic atmosphere and the same great food as you would find with a place like Stella's or Baked Expectations, with none of the hassle of being downtown, the craziness of parking, or the long line-ups and huge crowds.
So the one hard thing about getting healthy is expanding your food options. I know that I have in the past stuck to the same safe foods that I know I like. I used to be the person who would go to the same restaurants and get the same foods. I got a lot better after a semester in Chicago where I had to eat at different ethnic restaurants but once I got home I tended to still lean towards some of the same foods although I was always willing to try new things I never really would cook or make anything different at home now. It’s always the same baked chicken, baked pork chops or some kind of casserole. So now I am trying to open my mind and kitchen to various types of food, especially since I got a copy of a great Weight Watchers cookbook. And I got another one with some great breakfast things in it that I’ve already started making my shopping lists from. But the last couple of days (running low on food and unable to go shopping until next Friday) I had to try to think of something semi healthy to eat with what I already had in the house (which is not much). So I decided to have a tuna melt but instead of putting it on regular wheat bread I opted for whole wheat tortilla!
First, you might have seen the glass hurricanes back around Christmas time. These were as easy as the rest of them.

How are things with you guys? I really hope life is treating you well. We have been back to Dorset for half term, always a pleasure. Mum and Dad treated the kids to a 'new to them' bike each which bought us all so much joy. Watching the kids get their confidence up and down the terrace where I too learned to ride with my big brother was magic. Simon and I got a night away which is always a treat, we caught up with family who we haven't seen in ages and an Aunt of mine who Anna hadn't even met before- how crazy is that? Especially as they got on like a burning building! Our week back has been a bit less relaxing; Will needed to be collected from school as he had split his chin falling from some play equipment. I think we have been lucky to make this our first A&E trip in a combined 13 years of child herding, but I'm not in any hurry to make up for lost time! Will is fine and the steri-strips can come off on Tuesday. I was also under a little pressure to get my C&G design module 'Texture' ready for internal verification. Now you know that these modules are not my favourite but I'm pleased to say that my work passed and this has now been thoroughly signed off.

I couldn’t help but stare at the man sat on the table next to us. He was alone and had ordered a big plate of chips with an even bigger burger. At first I thought, look at you eating out, on your own, such a confident soul. An hour later, he was still there, with nearly the same amount of food on his plate. Two hours later, he began carefully cutting his chips into thirds. I came to the conclusion that he definitely had some form of eating disorder.
I’m quite tired, so while we have free periods after lunch I am going to break one of my rules and go home and sleep a bit. After I grill Abbie. Then I’m going to eat and get some energy for the bike-ride home. Unfortunately I have to go down to town to get something edible.
Yesterday was Day Two and it was exponentially harder! I nicknamed it “visually stalking” people day. The challenge was to actually “gaze” at men (or women, if that’s what you go for) and decide if they could be the love of your life that might be passing you by forever. If they could be that person, act accordingly. Well, I don’t get out much. But I gazed while at the grocery store and the gym (leered is what it felt like) and there really aren’t many men out there that I would see physically and think that I could be with forever. I guess that’s really just not me. Does anyone do that? See someone and just know they’re the ONE? I guess that would be “love at first sight”, which I don’t believe in anyway.
My lovely kitten also keeps me busy - she has developed a keen liking to my new cardigan and keeps getting it out of everywhere I hide it! She is most mischievous but also too cute so I can't stay mad with her.

This move is something the boys and I all want. It is great to be here with my family but I don't feel like I belong here in Iceland. I don't feel like I am home. I have been trying to live here but I know I can't.

I mean, honestly, I've been heartbroken by the earthquake in Haiti, and I have given money. I have friends in the military who are there right now.

It's time for my garden update. I wish you all could see how much everything is growing! The picture above is one of our four pumpkin plants that are growing in our front bed. We planted pumpkins last year and had four return this season. I think those big, green leaves are so pretty!
Let the vampires stay in their world, and let Dick and Jane stay in theirs. Let grown-ups stay in their world, and let kids stay in theirs. The mixing of the two, in this instance, is just too weird.

Wednesday night saw me and bro go as punters- nice to get to a festival early on for the full selection, but a little tricky on the head the following morning. We spent the night cramming in as many of the Christmas beers and porters as we could, including the intriguingly wierd Christmas Wheat by Pitfield and Milestone's Harry Porter. Magic. Brodie's festival special, Piggy Winkle's Christmas Tinkle, was deceptively festive for the light hoppy flavour- I reckon there's some cloves in there somewhere. We had a lovely chat with James Brodie (who, according to Facebook, felt even more hungover than I did) and I got confused for Lizzie several times due to me T-shirt. We left feeling festive, more than merry and with some good tips about beer festivals in New York.

We race through life getting to where we want to go as fast as we can. We rush down the road of life on our selfish journeys oblivious to the fact that the God who came to earth to redeem us from our dangerous destiny of damnation, stands at the side of the road waiting for us to stop and let Him take the wheel. The sad thing is, we neither seek Him nor do we even do we understand Him. Romans 3:11 says: “there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God“ . What a sad story of the human race. The God of this universe, the One who made us to know and love Him sits at the side and watches mankind as we drive right by Him.

A friend once told me that I reminded her of Katherine Heigl. I can see it. Sometimes I'm uptight like her character in "Knocked Up." I like to think I have a much better sense of humor than she does, but regardless... I'm much more of freak inside my own mind than I am, AT ALL, on the outside.
When the year ended, I found out that JASMS never completed their transfer to Batasan, but it was too late to go back. I didn’t know why I thought I couldn’t go back. I was miserable in Miriam, but going back to JASMS seemed impossible. I don’t know why I didn’t try to call my best friend Lara (I talked to her on the phone, so I must have known her number. I didn’t know Raisa’s number. I didn’t care for my friend Katrina) to find out where she was and what she was doing. I forgot all about JASMS. My transfer to Miriam was complete.

The last-minute decision to rename must have been a bit peeving for Marvel Studios, as this film is the culmination of possibly the longest and most expensive advertising campaign in cinema history. You may remember the first trailer, which appeared in theatres in 2008 under the title Iron Man… oh, all right, I’m exaggerating a bit, but the fact remains that the two Iron Man movies, Captain America, Thor, and The Incredible Hulk all had a definite sense of building towards this moment. This kind of coming together of separate characters and series happens all the time in comics, but it’s a new and bold departure as far as cinema is concerned. All credit to Marvel for giving it a whirl, and even moreso for giving the writer-director gig of a huge movie to someone whose last film didn’t even make its money back in theatres: Joss Whedon.
And so, I would like to thank Irina for having given me this great opportunity to create on such a wonderful design team and I wish all the DT nothing but the best as they are a wonderful group of ladies with outstanding talent. Thanks again-God Bless! xox Trish :)

We all went out a few days after Tiffany joined our family. She was lovingly placed in her doggy crate (with door open) in the cosiest corner of the pergola, with her chew toys, a dog biscuit, fresh water and a warm doggy blanket close by. It was raining very heavily, and when we arrived home barely an hour later we thought she would still be there. But she wasn't. She had run around to the other side of the house and had been sitting under Dragon's bedroom window whining and crying in the rain. She had also managed to find the one prickly weed we had neglected to remove from the backyard and I think she must have rolled in it. Her feet were covered in mud and 'sticky-beak' prickles clustered thickly throughout her fur.
Finally, the prophet Jeremiah declares, “The people have forsaken God and made the land a place of foreign gods by filling the Temple with the blood of the innocent victims of sacrifice. They have built the high places to burn their children in the fire as offerings to Baal—something God did not command or mention nor did it enter God’s mind” (19.4-5; cf. 7.30-31). Then, in chapter 31, Jeremiah proclaims a new covenant in which God forgives transgressions and remembers sin no more without any need for a sacrifice (animal, human or otherwise) to enable God to forgive and forget.

i was standing in the middle of the street when i took that picture with my cell phone. the crazy part is that it was like that in both directions. there was no way to get out...and no way for anyone to get in either. it completely freaked me out - baby on my back, no wood to heat the house, no food that didn't require cooking. i thought we would be there for days. luckily, by the end of the day Sunday, with the very generous help of some neighbors, we were lucky to get out.

The Westminster Standards are also explicit in their statement about the purpose of life, for humanity to glorify God, and that goal is only possible through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. That is the message to which the whole Bible speaks, the redemption and the unmatched lordship of Jesus Christ, just as he himself taught those broke-down disciples on the road to Emmaus.

I don't have much today but I thought I'd share it any way. I went to the dentist last week--it was supposed to be just my 6 month check up but I'd been having some pain on the right side. Any way--long story short---he told me I am getting "long in the tooth"!!! I'd always heard that expression and I just want to state that it does mean what I thought it meant!!! I'm getting OLD!!! My gums are receding and my teeth are looking "longer" !! HA!!! Then I finally had my eye appointment too---what a week!!! There I was told I have presbyopia--which translates to "OLD EYE"!!! Gee thanks docs!!! So it's official!!!! I'm OLD!!! I also have astigmatism---my glasses should be here next week. I checked prices before I ordered them--who knew progressive lenses were so expensive. So---I'm slowly working on doing a better job of taking care of my old self!!!! Hopefully the glasses will help with the headaches and some of the dizziness--the doctor said it should as my eyes are working too hard at trying to focus since they are competing with each other due to the difference in their "issues".
Sometimes, like my three toddler grandchildren, we need to be reminded to use the skills we are gaining. Frustration and whining decreased when they learned the signs for milk, please and thank you. Now they are starting to talk, and the oldest one is being actively taught to use kind words by her parents who have instituted a time of blessing every day. Even the 18 month old is learning to say, “Nice, smart, kind, strong.”

Tomorrow, I’ll be ready to go back to the old way of doing business, living in a whirlwind of meaningless, pre-scripted “thank-you’s” offered solely as a way to evoke a certain behavior, usually getting you to leave the premises. These are the devalued, distorted expressions we encounter a hundred times a day, the ones that have so removed the true meaning of gratitude that when we feel the real thing, it gives us a very bad stomachache.

A major selling point for me is integration of the desktop version of Logos with the iPad App. For the most part, the books you own are stored “in the cloud” and the are available on the iPad or your desktop. There are some exceptions: The Hebrew-Aramaic Lexicon on the Old Testament is not available on the iPad. I have been a longtime user of the Theological Journals library from Galaxie Software and I am thrilled that all of the journals in that collection are available on my iPad. Logos recently released a collection of Journal of Biblical Literature, 26 years of one of the finest journals for biblical studies (1981-2006) are now available on my iPad. That is nearly 20,000 pages of fully searchable scholarship!

I don’t watch anime. It’s a strange thing to be coming from someone whose manga library becomes more and more unwieldy with each passing day, but I really don’t watch much anime. I did when I was younger, quite a bit actually. But as I got older, I began to notice that a lot of the stuff being produced was not that great.
No mean task this and I hope to make the magical number. But even if I don’t, here are some of the blogs I love to stop by and more than deserve this award. Hope you enjoy them as much as I do.
Claudia Tergis I was born in Munich Germany. My mother is of Spanish decent, my father is German and I was raised speaking both languages. Having lived in both Munich Germany and Mexico City I am familiar with both cultures ,traditions, and fluent in both languages. I graduated from SUNY Purchase and have a BA in Anthropology, a BA in Languages & Cultures, and have taken classes in Early Childhood Education. Before having my children and moving to Connecticut I worked at Central Speech Language and Pathology where I was responsible for: children with speech and behavioral problems, Interpreting and translating Spanish speech, and Educational Evaluations as well as intake forms. I was also the Social Service Coordinator with Spanish speaking families. After moving to CT, I returned to school to obtain my Real-Estate License, I currently work for Prudential Connecticut in Westport and cover the areas: Darien, Norwalk, Westport, Fairfield, and Stratford. Being a Realtor is a liberating occupation I can respond directly to my clients. I can go the extra distance for them and feel great about the personal rewards of helping people. In any job, I believe open communication, honesty and ethical dealings are of the utmost importance. As a Realtor I want my clients to feel comfortable to approach me with any question or concern. My International clients should feel comfortable reaching out to me and asking me for advice or local information. I want them to consider me a friend and build a life long relationship. Moving from one country to an other or from state to state can be very stressful, I want to take the stress out of house hunting and make it a fun experience for my clients. I am a people oriented person. I always give my clients first priority in a day's activity. I try to treat every person as if they are the only one and they can sense it. I'm not comfortable unless I'm giving 110%. " Mit dem schwachen US Dollar sehen die Immobilien hier in Fairfield County unwiderstehlich aus. Die relative schnelle Verbindung nach New York City, macht Fairfield County zum idealen Wohnort. Wenn Sie Statistiken fuer den Connecticut Immobilienmarkt haben wollen, koennen Sie mir gern ein Email schicken.” " Siendo el curso del dolar tan bajo por el momento son las propiedades/ bienes raices, en los Estados Unidos muy interesantes. Fairfield County es una puerta para New York.

Included in this reaction is re-branding of the individual mandate to "the personal responsibility clause", which is what brings a question: Do they realize that the use of "personal responsibility" opens up a can of worms? Personal responsibility demands an avoidance of dependence on the government. It, also, demands ethical behavior and being responsible by reading legislation before signing. Neither of these things were the goal of the Congress at the time the bill was signed and the result is a country that is now demanding relief from the burdens of the entitlement class and government intrusion.
I thought it would be fun to do a little paper-piecing with papers from MME.
Once baby is born you'll want the placenta to be placed into a bag (usually a red bio hazard bag) and put into the refrigerator to keep fresh. Usually they'll examine the placenta in the labor room to make sure there are no abnormalities which could indicate a problem with the baby. When they do that make sure they're using a clean and sterile service. If your placenta needs to go down to pathology make sure to tell them that that placenta is going home so it needs a clean and sterile environment and know using chemicals on it.
N- on the common man, I cannot now decide how much this is his opinion or how much of it is a satire on people who would hold this opinion, or to what extent admixture, ‘Our highest insights must–and should– sound like follies and sometimes like crimes when they are heard without permission by those who are not predisposed and predestined for them…What serves the higher type of men as nourishment or delectation must almost be poison for a very different and inferior type…Books for all the world are always foul-smelling books: the smell of small people clings to them.’ He writes of the strategy of some eastern philosophical/religious traditions of the ‘exoteric’ and ‘esoteric’ doctrine; that there is one set of teachings, the exoteric, which come ‘from below’ to address the needs of the simple men, and the esoteric which ‘looks down from above’, from ‘heights of the soul’. An example of an esoteric teaching might be ‘There are heights of the soul from which even tragedy cease to look tragic’ which the common people either cannot comprehend or cannot tolerate, it seeming ‘immoral’ to them who have not yet transcended the good/evil dichotomy. I wonder how well one could interpret this very work as being simultaneously exoteric and esoteric, the more ‘surface’ reading of N- being closer to tolerable to the many, but the ‘deeper’ interpretation possible by close reading (neither with a critical or a ‘friendly’ attitude) could potentially reveal what N- considers ‘esoteric’ or ‘higher’ knowledge…

Texas locks up fewer than 160,000 inmates in state prisons, but according to census data, the number of "unauthorized" immigrants runs to ten times that number - more than 1.6 million people. To actually accomplish such a goal would require upheaval rivaled in history only by Soviet transmigration policies under Stalin, rounding up and incarcerating millions for the crime of finding a job, working, and raising a family on the wrong side of the border.

First of all I would like to wish Happy Chinese New Year to all of you! Today was third day of Chinese New Year and I am glad that I able to update some blogpost and share with you all right now! Was pretty busy and having fun on Chinese New Year, I hope that you all got the same with me too! Second day of Chinese New Year, I was watching movie with my friends in Tropicana City Mall, it is very hard to get ticket in Chinese New Year season, Thanks to my friend that she was able to book it online.
Here’s the thing: You have no idea what someone else is going through. For example, in the case of the above questions, I’d love more than anything to be starting a family right now. I do want to get married and want to have children more than anything. Unfortunately, I have Turner Syndrome and that isn’t likely to happen. It kills me to watch my childhood friends, my cousins, and my little sister become mothers knowing that I don’t get to join the club, at least not yet. In fact, there is a very real reason why I don’t want to get married at this point. I don’t wanted to be asked continuously why I’m not pregnant yet, especially considering most women my age are starting to hear the tick of the biological clock.
i'm sure you've seen it, too. people who write, "your the best." or perhaps, "their such nice guys." or any of the kabillion things we are taught IN GRADE SCHOOL.
Marquez allowed three unearned runs in the first inning. They were unearned, but he still allowed three straight two-out hits after errors had extended things, and I was concerned. Fortunately, Marquez settled down and pitched very well from the second inning on. He lasted 6.2 innings, giving up four runs (one earned) with just two walks.
Notwithstanding varieties within the species, all coconut palm trees are Cocos nucifera. So, yes, all coconuts are the same - except when you want to milk one. I am not referring to the species variations, but rather to the appropriate stage of a coconut's development. Contrary to what its name implies, a coconut is not a nut; it is, in fact, a drupe - a type of fruit that includes peaches, plums and cherries. Unlike the juicy flesh of those delicious drupes, however, it is the seed which is edible and what we recognize as a coconut. Depending on its stage of maturity, this seed yields meat and liquid of entirely different textures and consistencies.

He should be illegal. Hubby always asks why I never use him and I answer him with this: He’s the KFC of sex experiences, the poutine of novelties, and the all-day spa of kinky toys… he’s just soooo good that you can’t indulge in him too frequently. It wouldn’t be right.

What is the difference between ice cream and kulfi, you ask? Well, the main difference is that kulfi is not whipped like ice cream is. The result is a much denser consistency which makes kulfi very, very slow melting. I personally find kulfi much creamier than ice cream, even the custard based types.

There were two teachers. One lead the class and the other assisted the students. The assistant teacher was very gentle and attentive, and she gave me a brief leg, foot, neck, and shoulder massage at the end!!! To be fair, she gave everyone a massage at the end, but I’ve never experienced that in a yoga class before. That massage sealed the deal for me.

Sending you my biggest hugs. We'll be headed to the Food Bank to volunteer as a family. Usually I go on my own, but the Mr. and the Coopster are going to come with me. We thought it would be fun to serve as a family in celebration of this day. Hoping for some heart shaped waffles in the morning, inhaling some of the sugar cookies Coop and I decorated (similar to last year), having a simple dinner as a fam, and basically just enjoying the day with my little buddy. Hope you all find a beautiful way to celebrate.

I guess that the question still eggs me on though. Why do people get more than one baptism if they only need to acknowledge one for the remission of sins? I think I need to talk to my pastor about his views on baptism. I don’t think I’ll be getting baptized again any time soon. That decision has a lot to do with family politics basically, but even just my own thoughts about the whole thing, I don’t think it will happen any time soon.
After work, out it came and I patiently made the filling and rolled the dough, perfect rectangle. Yes, it was to be a circle. Then, I spread the filling, another rectangle and came to the rolling the triangles. It went well but with all the oozing, later, the shapes lost something in the translation. I could not care though. These were the most delicious cookies. The oozing cooked up into the tastiest edges (like a lace cookie)
I revisited the house later that same day, and as I walked the quiet grounds, I realized that my real hesitation was with FORCED change. I’m a master at self-induced change. And that day, as I handed over my deposit and shook my landlords hand, I realized that I wasn’t only getting a new physical location, I was embracing a new state of mind.
Cox is a man boy waggling his box of toys at us: he has nothing new to tell us, just a new way - thanks to his talking smile. At public expense he gets to fly at 60,000 ft to admire the dark blue of the sky, to drive over desert sand dunes to show us what Mars is like (air: thin), and he lights Chinese lanterns to demonstrate the effects of hot air. Oh, it rises.
Yesterday I went and visited some of the Occupy Wall Street happenings near my job ( don’t worry, this isn’t going the political route). Protesters were congregating in Madison Park, and had brought professors from universities around the area to teach free lessons to the public.
A class from Norfolk Park School visited the CLC over the last two weeks to use the OMi Vista interactive floor projector. The class members have a range of Special Educational Needs, and they really enjoyed the time on the mat.

As some of you may know when I am not running La Margarita ( umm well in truth Susana runs the guests side of it these days I am the farmer! ) I am involved with Tierra Estates , a property company I started some years ago here. One of my earlier customers was Abby who purchased here and has (not going to give her surname) decided that now is the time to sell her very nice apartment she purchased a few years ago in central BA. She wasn’t going to spend much more time here and so it was time to sell. We have been in contact over the years since we look after the apartment for her so she turned to me for advice. We got it valued and started the process to sell it – as it happened we found a buyer really fast and started the ball rolling. Since Abby wasn’t coming here to do the signing of the sale we needed to get a power of attorney so we could handle the sale for her and of course the money side of it. I said the best and least inexpensive way to do that (on our lawyers advise) was for us to send her by email a power of attorney document in Spanish and for her to take it to the Argentine Embassy in New York where they can do the power and they can also verbally translate it for her to make sure she knows what she is signing and then send it back to us.
