“As you continue to drink, you’re just continuing to lower your total serum sodium, you’re diluting yourself,” said Maharam, who writes the “Ask the Running Doc” column in runnersworld.com. “Studies have shown that if you stopped at every water station along the course — and most of them have them every mile — and you drink one cup of Gatorade, you’re dead by the time you finish. Or your serum sodium is really low.
But the Browns still lost. They are 0-3. In the business of sports, especially for one in which there are only 16 regular-season games and fans paint their bodies and pay for personal seat licenses, the result is what matters.

If you are a sergeant first class, or major, or higher in either category, you know nobody is going to heck your bag. Yes, there is the acking list, but you know from ears of experience -- going to the "field" and going to war -- what you do need and what you don't. Somehow, you still end up with only those few cubic inches, because even though what you need may be differ ent, it still has to fit into those same damned two bags.

The cast is great, especially Kevin Spacey as an executive trying mightily to hang onto what's left of his soul. It's hard to find anyone to root for in such a dispiriting situation, but Spacey's character at least understands and gives voice to the havoc the firm's actions will wreak. And to Chandor's credit, while we may loathe some characters, we at least understand and thus, to some extent, care about them.

Martin made Hall a priority shortly after taking the job at South Carolina. He offered Hall while he was still at Kansas State and Hall was the first player he personally visited, the Tuesday after the Final Four. South Carolina assistants came to Jefferson on two other occasions as well and told Hall he would get a chance to contribute immediately as Martin looks to rebuild the program, which went 2-14 in the SEC last season.
On Wednesday, panel members credited Minnesota with making strides toward improving the system. In 2009, a new state law created a "bill of rights" for those under guardianship or conservator care. The law added more monitoring and made it easier to challenge bad decisions. It requires guardians and conservators to register and provide disclosures to the state courts. Unlike some states, the legislation did not require certification of professional guardians.

"I think this bag is very pretty. I like this one," she told him. "I said, 'You should get it.' She said, 'Next time.'"
It appears less likely that the Cardinals will find a way to fit free agent Roy Oswalt into the spring training picture. Oswalt has expressed an interest in pitching for the Cardinals, and the club did make an offer to the righthander, who was with the Philadelphia Phillies last season.
Amazingly, the fans have stuck with this mess. Maybe the disgusted die-hards have given their tickets to buddies who rarely see a game. Or maybe a Blazers game on a rainy night is better than anything else Portland has to offer. Whatever the case, fans continued to arrive at the Garden, ready to clap, scream and whistle, always creating a lively atmosphere that makes this one of the most special venues in the NBA.
The 17-year congressman's remarks came during an often contentious appearance before the Chicago Tribune editorial board with his March 20 Democratic primary opponent, former U.S. Rep. Debbie Halvorson, who said the House investigation was keeping Jackson from doing his job.

Some among the sleek set in the fashion industry think the 19-year-old, self-promoting model is too chubby to be chic -- their definition of hefty encompassing 99% of the nation’s females. The fashion mavens denigrate Upton’s whole look – her too-blond hair, her generic, pouty cheerleader face and her long legs that one critic described as looking as if they belong to a player for the WNBA. The casting director for Victoria’s Secret fashion shows said she’d never allow such a skank to darken her runway. (We all know how Victoria’s Secret is the epitome of haute couture.)

Game 1 gave the appearance that the match between the experienced Haybalers -- who reached CCS two seasons ago -- and the Wildcatz would be a barnburner. It featured gigantic swings and hits, beautiful setting and solid passing. Hollister broke away late, before Watsonville closed the gap to 20-17 thanks to the teamwork between cousins Markus and Fabian Serrano. San Benito had height on its side, however, and after gaining a little breathing room, 6-foot-2 middle Carlos Gutierrez put the game away with a straight-down smack of a Watsonville overpass.
Automobiles are a loaded subject, especially in the decades following World War II in the United States, which has led some observers to ascribe specific social meanings to Chamberlain's art. The crushed automobiles have been connected to the violent death of Abstract Expressionist painter Jackson Pollock, who wrapped his car around a tree in 1956, and then to the slightly later, 1960s car-crash paintings of Pop artist Andy Warhol. Chamberlain was skeptical. Of his choice of automobile sheet metal, the artist once said, "Michelangelo had a lot of marble in his backyard, so to speak; I had a lot of this stuff."

WASHINGTON-- In the flesh, she doesn't have an aura. She isn't lit from within. Heads do not snap in her direction when she walks through a hotel lobby in a baggy maxi-dress and brown calf-high boots, flanked by her dutiful makeup artist of 35 years and her imperious publicist -- the few celebrity trappings of a woman who stubbornly considers herself a working actor and nothing more.
Mark Haisma, who produces a Bourgogne Chardonnay outside of Gevrey-Chambertin, is one of the few who will speak openly. He says the problem lies with a winemaking technique that favored light, delicate, fresh wines, but resulted in wines that were susceptible to premature oxidation. "We got very enamored with very protective pressing of white juice to preserve the freshness and the brightness," he says. "A lot of people were thinking we want this brightness, this aromatic style, but I always wondered: Are we creating a wine that is becoming more susceptible to becoming oxidized later?"

Haunted tale: When Ken Johnson signed on to care for the museum's 26 buildings, dating from the 19th century to statehood in 1912, he didn't expect to hear children singing in the old school house. As caretaker of Pioneer Living History Museum in north Phoenix, he has seen an outline of a shadow darting at the Opera House and felt the Victorian House's icy cold attic in the Valley's summer heat. While caring for museum property for 18 months, he has tried to ignore the odd noises and paranormal activity. "I'm an old guy, and I don't like being unnerved," Johnson said.

Technicians bought off-the-shelf equipment at Radio Shack and Best Buy to build a system to allow ground forces to see the drones' video feeds. At least one drone crashed because it had no fuel gauge, and the aircraft ran out of fuel.

Star power is not nothing, though, and "The Holiday" has that covered, thanks to its toothsome cast -- they're a dental paradise, this lot -- and to a premise (L.A. dame exchanges houses with a Brit) requiring little elaboration.

Hey, Tony: Mike Holmgrem listed several variables as to why the Browns' record was what is it was. I was disappointed that no one asked about other teams with similar variables and yet they all got better. Every team with a new coach (no off-season) improved its record.

"In less than two weeks, President Obama will be in Columbus, where he will argue for four more years of the same failed policies that have produced record unemployment and skyrocketing gas prices.

Our country can’t afford four more years of President Obama – it is time to put a proven leader with the record to back it up in the White House. That is why I support Mitt Romney and why Ohio will support him in November.”

Obama is expected to lay out proposals to increase hiring with a blend of tax incentives for business and government spending for public works projects. With July unemployment at 9.1 percent and the economy in a dangerously sluggish recovery, Obama's plan has consequences for millions of Americans and for his own political prospects.

The walls around the kingdom at State College, Pa. are crumbling ... it's no surprise. It's inevitable. The uber coaches and their bosses think they're completely secure as long as they win games and rake in the millions and millions of dollars. Are they protected? Sure, the success does that. It helps them through some tough times, some mini-scandals. But the would-be kings are never as secure as they believe they are. The walls to the kingdom can collapse at anytime, and for some reason these people never learn the lesson. Not even Joe Pa, who became increasingly oblivious to reality.

But researchers saw it a different way: Some snakes made it through the snap and resumed breeding.

Philips says the bulb will also save plenty of energy: It consumes less than 10 watts to produce light that is the equivalent of a 60-watt incandescent bulb, saving 83% of energy in the process.

Sharon (Susan Sarandon) is a widow stuck with two loser sons, and the slightest hint of affection or interest from a co-worker could alter her later-in-life loneliness.

Mr. Jobs's negotiation of personal relationships has been, by reputation, fraught and idiosyncratic. But whose isn't? And whatever his interpersonal challenges, a different kind of warmth is also apparent. An image that will become part of the Jobs lore, inevitably, is his extraordinary determination to cling to life, at least partly for the benefit of the company he created and the customers he accrued.

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services has stopped referring foster care and adoption cases to Catholic charitable groups and said it is planning to move all existing cases to other agencies.

The culture of the Sheriff's Department needs nothing short of a drastic overhaul. Holding town hall meetings with inmates, as Baca has already begun doing, and inviting reporters to sit in seems more like a publicity stunt than a commitment to meaningful change. And though he has formed two task forces to review allegations, both are fatally compromised by the fact that they are made up of department insiders, including some who may have failed to detect problems despite complaints from civil rights attorneys and inmates' lawsuits. As L.A. County Supervisors Gloria Molina and Zev Yaroslavsky said when they called for an independent investigator, Baca's internal monitors, including the Office of Independent Review, "may be very much a part of the problem."

The Cards have gotten just 21 wins from the guys projected as the 1-2-3 starters coming into spring training so with at least reasonably good health they'll blow that total away.

* We popped by the Dim Mak party at the Dream South Beach’s Highbar just in time to randomly run into XS co-owner Jesse Waits, who was holding court with DJs including R3hab and Steve Aoki. XS is part of Steve Wynn’s collection of Las Vegas nightclubs, and Wynn made a monster announcement earlier in the week about 34 exclusive DJ residencies, including Tiesto, David Guetta, Calvin Harris, Skrillex and Swedish House Mafia’s Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso.

Both Wynn and the group behind Vegas clubs Marquee, Tao and Lavo (which ran the VIP tables at the Ultra Music Festival) flew huge banners above the beach to remind visitors of that.

For full site disclosure, Lombardi's report may want to be taken with a grain of salt given his recent track record with specific regard to the Browns. It was the same columnist who stated that Jamal Lewis was at risk of not making the Browns' 53-man roster last fall, and was also was the victim of a pretty large swing-and-miss with regard to the Browns and head coach Eric Mangini.

"There's no question we're not batting a high enough percentage in some of our personnel decisions, I will grant you that," Sendek said.
