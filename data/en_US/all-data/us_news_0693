There is a purity to such straightforward repetitions of familiar shapes, allowing the eye to drink in the essence of form and color. The process is at its most basic in Alan Charlton's "Solent" from 1985 — 30 individual, silver-colored strips, 87 inches by 7 inches, placed closed together.
Aitken had appealed to Christie for commutation after being sentenced in August. He could have been paroled in three years. According to the commutation order, Aitken will be released as "soon as administratively possible."

Unlike a regular tax credit that offsets some or all of a tax liability, a refundable credit can include a cash payment in excess of the tax owed. As a result, refundable credits offer an incentive to defraud the government, George told the House Ways and Means subcommittee in May.
This is painful.

Jim Pickett, director of prevention advocacy and gay men's health at the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, has had the AIDS virus since 1995. He says his medical costs, mostly covered by health insurance, have continually increased since then; his HIV medicines alone cost $30,000 a year.

Point Loma's Katie McEachern (Dartmouth).
Abreu said in February that he preferred to be traded if he wasn't going to be an everyday player. Scioscia told Abreu he would get 400 plate appearances, but with Morales returning and young slugger Trumbo available to play corner outfield and DH, there is little need for Abreu.
Strickland, in a telephone interview, marveled at the reported dollar amount -- "approaching half of a billion dollars, a chunk of change," he said. The former governor stopped short of calling the offer excessive but questioned the wisdom of fighting other states for jobs.
Mantee Chef Jonathan Darakjian's food is a somewhat lightened version of classic Lebanese dishes. (His kafta kebab, made with lean, hand-ground Angus beef, may not be greasy enough for some traditionalists.) But there's nothing "lite" about the house namesake dish, mantee. The tiny agnolotti-like dumplings of Turkish origin (sometimes spelled manti) are about as addictive as buttered popcorn. Inside the al dente pasta, nuggets of lemony vegetarian spinach filling or of subtly seasoned house-ground beef make ideal canvases for the creamy sharp yogurt-garlic sauce that blankets them.
WASHINGTON -- One by one, the world’s top finance officials Saturday pressed Europe to do more to shore up its debt problems, warning that the global recovery remains fragile and that the Eurozone shouldn’t relax now that it has secured more resources to fight the crisis.
the outcry heard everywhere from Occupy Wall Street protests to kitchen tables in the Chicago area, President Barack Obama recently sped up plans to help graduates dig out.

Meanwhile, Rep. Ron Paul and former Sen. Rick Santorum retain sizable followings, and though they've been unable to broaden their support, they still fracture the field. That's common in early nomination contests, and the ultimate winner is usually a candidate such as Romney who relies on preparation, organization and money — not momentum.
Morley, who is less than half-way through his first term on council, said he’s running for mayor to bridge a communication gap he feels is dividing the council and administration.
Research continues in the development of artificial hearts. That technology, previously used as a bridge to transplant in patients awaiting cardiac transplantation, is now gaining acceptance as destination therapy for patients in whom transplantation is not being considered. Recent reports of successful strengthening of damaged heart muscle using stem cell therapy also provides hope for the future in the treatment of cardiomyopathy.
I arrived in Marseille, France, then hopped a train for the five-hour journey northwest. For one week, I would eat Roquefort on baguettes. In salads. On le chicken and le duck. Straight out of the package with a fork. Roquefort-flavored chocolate and potato chips? Oui. I would eat it until I could feel my pants becoming uncomfortably tight.
But meanwhile there is a national-security reality that is much less amenable to his sweet-talking. Iran's economy may be suffering, but it appears to be unmoved by sanctions. Israel is unwilling to bide its time indefinitely while an existential threat emerges. So Obama's words are less important and decisive than they have ever been. What matters is what the Iranians are doing (or not), how Israel assesses that risk and whether Israel will be compelled to act independently. And then we will find out to what degree Obama really does stand with Israel.
The Telugu community hails mostly from the Andhra Pradesh region of India, and Aekka said that his Indian culture values forgiveness.
So far, the biggest pro-union demonstrations have been in Madison, Wis. Even those unions exempted from proposed cuts -- firefighters and police officers, who endorsed Gov. Scott Walker during his 2010 campaign -- have shown up en masse to support other public workers.

Housing comeback: The Star Advertiser reported the median home price on Oahu rose to $625,000 from $548,000 a year ago, a 14 percent jump. March was the fifth straight month of rising prices.

Or drink it black, like Dr. Mike does; just remember your daily calcium/magnesium/vitamin D-3 tablet. And use a paper filter when brewing; it traps a compound that increases lousy LDL cholesterol. There are other ways regular, instant and decaf, too, help you live longer and healthier. Among them:
Sitting near the confluence of the Kaw and Missouri rivers, Kansas City has had a long history of supplying low-priced water and sewer services to residents and businesses.
That wasn’t the case with at least one of the four arguments about various legal questions posed by Obamacare. On Tuesday newscasts happily recycled pithy comments by the justices about the constitutionality of the law’s insurance requirement, even though they had to illustrate the recordings with still pictures of the questioners. And, yes, those excerpts were bite-sized and tasty.

“If you’re going to compete with him, you got to have those same type of guys. Certainly in the three years he’s been at Kentucky, even before that at Memphis, nobody’s recruited like he has. Nobody’s coached his guys better, too, considering how many young kids he has, how he gets them all to play for one purpose .’’

The Wings could finish as high as first in the Western Conference. (That is unlikely, since they trail St. Louis by six points with six games to play. But it's possible.) The Wings also could finish as low as sixth in the West, which might be better than fifth, because they would face a weak Pacific Division champ, which automatically gets the third seed.
"I've been acting all my life, doing things I shouldn't have been doing," Easterly said this week at CPT. "Now I can get paid to do it, and I can pay something back to this theater that took a big chance on me."
Yet Friday the case formed the basis for one of the most extraordinary rulings in Chicago legal history when a choked-up Circuit Judge Michael Toomin cited Delizon Bush in explaining why he was ordering a special prosecutor to investigate the 2004 death of David Koschman at the hands of then-Mayor Daley's nephew, Richard J. Vanecko.
Waters said he plans to be there when the Hallahans are eventually returned to Illinois and return to court for sentencing.

Ball may work for heavyweights, but he conveys an unaffected nature.

"Moving forward," Molica said, "we're all on the same page when it comes to a new sense of transparency and safety."
The takeaway: The soonest Murray State will play is Thursday, which means at least an 11-day layoff since it stopped Tennessee State in the OVC title game. The Racers took last Sunday and Monday off, and coach Steve Prohm filled the time with scrimmages, weightlifting sessions and individual workouts. In 2010, current seniors Donte Poole and Jewuan Long, junior Isaiah Canaan, senior Ivan Aska and junior Ed Daniel played as a 13 seed when the Racers beat Vanderbilt in the first round before falling to eventual NCAA runner-up Butler. That loss still sticks in their minds -- they lost by two points and then watched the Bulldogs march into midmajor history as a five seed.
Even President Barack Obama has placed his stamp of approval on this view of modern childhood. Introducing the Cartoon Network documentary, he solemnly intones: "I care about this issue deeply, not just as the president, but as a dad. ... We've all got more to do.

And as we noted yesterday, that's really the question: Did Warren game the "affirmative action" system?

Ach, Grandma says.
On third-and-five from the 9, Strock's pass skidded off Byner's hands, deflected off the left shoulder of Houston linebacker John Grimsley and fell into the hands of Herman Fontenot for a first down at the 2.

The Rev. Michael Witt has been serving as Kenrick's interim rector.
"I was already writing some chamber orchestra stuff and saw this as the next step to do something with text," said Horvitz, whose father and grandfather were labor arbitrators and mediators. "I applied for some grants. Nine times out of 10 you don't get the funding. I got the funding. So then I had to write the piece." Taking a labor maverick as a subject came naturally to Horvitz: Harry Bridges was a family friend who frequently visited the Horvitz household in Los Gatos, where Horvitz lived until the family moved to Washington D.C. in 1967.
"The coaches told me to get third, and I knew the guy that was in third is a good half-miler," Thompson said. "I really had to kick hard. It was a fun race. I looked up at the scoreboard, because I wanted to get a regional (qualifying mark), too. When I saw I had it, I was pumped."

Curtis said Dekraai also does not have access to a spinal-cord stimulator he needs because of an accident he suffered aboard a tugboat in 2007.
“Some kids can hardly wait, you can see them coming down the street running,” Johnson said. “One year I had a girl who that they couldn’t convince her to get in and see me. She came back the second night and came up to me and took a candy cane. She came up the third night and sat in my lap. By the fourth night, I think she was all over me and didn’t want to get out of the sleigh.”

First Ward Council (1)
Within minutes, Grace had replaced Christy Siebert as my personal trainer. We kicked the soccer ball, threw the soccer ball, threw snow balls, played tag and did 100 crunches. OK, we didn't do the crunches -- but we got the respective heart rates up. As we played, I thought: This is reason No. 1 why I'm trying to get into shape.
First of all, GM Tom Heckert is the buttoned-down type. He didn't exactly swing all out in the draft -- his wheelhouse -- unless your idea of going deep is defensive tackle Phil Taylor late in the first round. With a first-year head coach, new defensive coordinator, new defense, new offense and relatively new quarterback, Heckert can further justify a conservative approach in 2011.
White is cool about his place in history. His Caldwell home is no shrine. The only Beatles record he owns was a gift from EMI, buried somewhere in his basement. Scattered on the living room shelves are a handful of Beatles books that contain only a mention of his name. The footnote is enough. The books, like his stories, are within reach but not forefront.
He points to the Litchfield Tournament, which begins Saturday, as the hopeful start of that rebound.

Oil and gas resources would be developed about 50 miles off the Virginia coast and more than 125 miles from Florida's coast in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The government also will allow oil exploration in the Arctic Ocean. The President doesn't support drilling at Bristol Bay in Alaska because of environmental concerns. He said proposed leases in that area would be canceled.
"Teams are viewing him as a guy who can be a slot corner as well, which is important now with the evolution of the passing game in the NFL," Callahan said. "With so many slot receivers, and the impact that the slot receiver has, Trenton won't have to come off the field. He can be your nickel slot corner and your safety on first and second downs. I think him showing that speed helped his versatility."

Practice times are critical because the order of qualifying goes from slowest to fastest practice times. The later a driver qualifies, the better, because the track is cooler and conditions are more conducive to faster speeds. By having the sixth-fastest time, only five of the 46 drivers will run qualifying laps after Ambrose, giving him a huge advantage.
One of the leading attractions is Sahu Subtropicals, which draws from two farms in Fallbrook and Rainbow and currently features an abundance of Fuyu-type persimmons, the tomato-shaped fruit eaten firm like an apple.

Whoever Americans Elect's nominee turns out to be, that person could well replicate the signally dubious achievement of Ralph Nader in the 2000 election: Throwing the election to one of the two major-party nominees who otherwise would not have won. November's election is likely to be very close, and it takes no imaginative leap to envision this third-party candidate getting enough votes in a key swing state to toss the presidency to the otherwise loser. For those who believe that America already has traumas enough, Americans Elect is an unnecessary looming disaster.

Police from the Portland Central Precinct who rarely visit the area will patrol more frequently, towing cars if necessary and enforcing the city's law against open containers of liquor in parks and on school property. And the operators of Montgomery Park, an office park four blocks away, are offering hundreds of free parking spaces.
But I was not comfortable with writing a $50-billion check trying to avoid the managed bankruptcy process. Because my view was, and you can read the op-ed -- I know you have, probably more than once -- I was very concerned that the structural disadvantage in the industry, by virtue of its excessive costs and burdens, would mean that if they wrote a check for $50 billion, then wait a few years and have to write another check. You had to restructure the industry.

“We are not even close to understanding the biological mechanism behind this,” she said.
In California on Tuesday, a federal appeals court declared a voter-passed ban on same-sex marriages in California to be unconstitutional. Washington state voters and same-sex marriage opponents might want to read the writing on the wall. It is only a matter of time before government marriage means something different than it has. People are still free to encourage the biblical view or another religious view of marriage and make sure kids know the government does not use the same playbook they do or subscribe to the same source of knowledge. I assume it's much like when divorce became commonplace; parents had a lot of navigating to do.

In an often repeated 2001 segment from the syndicated radio program "This American Life," people are asked which superpower they would prefer: flight or invisibility? On the show the choice becomes shorthand for two sides of human nature, and that kind of consideration of motive plays a role in "The Visible Man," a novel by pop culture critic Chuck Klosterman about one man's ability to disappear.

Like all entrepreneurs with an artisan mentality, Clive Richardson wanted to control every aspect of the coffee he produced. Since 1992 he's been buying green coffee beans, processing and roasting them. He then offers the finished product at his retail outlet and cafe. With its rustic wood captain chairs and scarred wood table the interior feels like it's been around for about as long as the town. This is the must-stop place for a great cup of bottomless coffee and espresso drinks any time of day. At breakfast you'll find excellent house-baked pastries, including scones and breakfast sandwiches. You can also get a light lunch featuring soup and salad. Most people also take home some coffee - the shop features an impressive selection of blended and single-origin products.

reason to clean your house's ventilation ducts unless they are visibly contaminated or clogged. The suggestion from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency didn't prevent several consumers from hiring a Chicago-area duct cleaning company that started working our area. I wrote about consumers who said the company - Schaumburg-based Air Duct Cleaning Pros - advertises inexpensive cleaning specials, then intimidates homeowners into spending more.
Phelps’ longest outing of the season was 5⅓ innings in Anaheim after a poor start from Phil Hughes.
Though this is a great idea (and with luck it will catch on for the princesses, which often have long lines as well), a better (though more expensive) idea is to schedule a character breakfast or dinner where you are guaranteed time with several characters. On our recent visit, we did Chef Mickey's for dinner. Mickey, Minnie, Goofy, Donald and Pluto came to our table, sat with us, posed for pictures, signed autographs and delighted my children the entire time we were there. It was well worth the price (I think our family of four was about $100, but it included a fantastic buffet that served as our lunch and dinner), and with reservations (which you have to make months ahead), no wait.

My grandparents and basically my whole family live there, so that kind of led me to it. The coaches are really nice, it's a nice school, and they have a lot of majors to consider because I'm not sure exactly what I want to do yet.
Reiniger feels she is 100 percent recovered. After scoring a pair of goals in the win Tuesday over the Panthers, she has nine goals and two assists for 20 points. Her goal total now leads the team and her point total ties her with junior Kat Roe (eight goals, four assists, 20 points).

As Wise formulates his Super Bowl plan, he finds himself being courted by businesses carrying out their Super Bowl strategies. Pepsi has offered him tickets to the game, and even though Scotty's has a contract to sell Coca-Cola products in its restaurant "for now," as Wise puts it, he's inclined to accept rival Pepsi's ticket offer.
One way is to pretend that President Obama, a disappointment to many who support more rational gun laws, is actually a grave threat to gun rights. He most assuredly is not. Yet Mitt Romney, who once supported gun-control measures, tried to Etch A Sketch that past away before the NRA Friday, pledging to defend rights he claimed the president "ignores or minimizes."
11:20 -- TOUCHDOWN -- That was easy. Tom Brady orchestrated a textbook drive and concluded it with 12-yard touchdown to Aaron Hernandez. Brady now has 15 consecutive completions, a Super Bowl record and the momentum has officially swung to the Patriots' side. The Giants have not been able to get much pressure on Brady since the safety early in the first quarter and it's proven to be disastrous. The Patriots now lead 17-9.

Chicago police passed that simple test on May Day, when they confronted a relatively small and well-behaved crowd. But the many thousands of protesters expected to gather next week for a summit of NATO leaders could pose a far greater challenge for a force that has embraced new crowd-control techniques but never completely shed its reputation for brutality.
In 2008, Justin Vernon, who records as Bon Iver, launched himself out of the folk-pop underground with the spare, echoed “For Emma, Forever Ago,” a set of lovelorn ballads recorded in a hunting shack. The album was sufficiently arresting to catch the attention of Kanye West, who borrowed a heartbroken chorus from Vernon for “My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.” “Bon Iver,” his second album, will creep up on nobody: it’s one of the year’s most anticipated sets. Without entirely abandoning the sound of “For Emma,” Vernon has broadened his instrumental palette, refined his approach and purchased some nifty new electronic effects. The arrangements are inspired: taken in isolation, many moments are gorgeous. And with “Beth/Rest,” Vernon makes a move on the mainstream market that feels entirely sincere in its embrace of classic ’80s adult pop. “Wash.,” “Calgary” and “Lisbon, OH” feel like tear-stained dispatches from the road. Unfortunately, it is often next to impossible to make out what Vernon is saying. Muffled vocals may be permissible on a metal or electronica record, but a semi-acoustic singer-songwriter should not sacrifice clarity for the sake of beauty.
In his book TV-A Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol, Jake Austen wrote of Clark: If Clark is guilty of anything, it's being a serial capitalist.

We saw glimpses of his potential last year with Francis ended up playing second team reps and jumping in and out of the first team defensive front on third downs. He recorded 14 tackles (8 unassisted), 5 tackles for a loss, and 3.5 sacks on the year. He played in 12 games only missing the West Virginia game and made a very good impact in the Beef O'Brady St. Petersburg Bowl recording a sack and 2 solo tackles on the night. It shows that Francis can make a impact for RU and RU is a better defense when it utilizes his skill.

By and large, Republicans have a hard time applying their personal love of the outdoors to politics because they don't believe in an activist government. They may focus instead on efforts like local fisheries or planting pastures with prairie grasses.
In one remarkable morning, the Angels also reeled in C.J. Wilson, the top pitcher on the free-agent market, who agreed to a five-year, $77.5 million deal.

On Tuesday, police used no beanbags and only small amounts of tear gas in three skirmishes with protesters. In contrast to past demonstrations in which downtown was enveloped by clouds of the gas, it was possible Tuesday to see and breathe within minutes after the gas was released.

Signed in December, Molina has not hit at all this spring (.063), but his ability to handle the Yankees’ pitching staff in 16 games seems to have given him the edge. Molina made the White Sox Opening Day roster in 2007 and has since played for the Orioles, Mets and Red Sox.
At various points, "The Trouble With Bliss," directed by Michael Knowles from Douglas Light's novel "East Fifth Bliss," evokes forerunners as dissimilar as "Moonstruck" and "After Hours" in its eccentric mix of the everyday and the surreal. Although it has some cute repartee, this movie more often than not confuses eccentricity with originality. Sentimental to the core, it treats its characters as the world's most adorable kooks, which they are not.
Meanwhile, the sci-fi action flick "Battleship" got off to a solid start overseas this past weekend, grossing $58 million in 26 foreign countries. That sounds good — until you compare it with the receipts for "Titanic 3D," which has collected that much in China alone.
The other seniors were pitcher Kelsie Stoszkus (17-3, 0.76 ERA), first baseman Michelle Craddick (.409, six homers, 30 RBIs) and pitcher Erica Wilson, (4-0, 0.68 ERA).

OAKLAND -- A man died after being shot Saturday afternoon in East Oakland, becoming the 44th homicide of the year, police said.
China rebounded quickly from the global crisis on the strength of a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus and a flood of lending by state banks. Easy credit fueled a surge in real estate and stock prices, prompting Chinese regulators to tighten controls earlier this year as other economies were still struggling with recession.
Payne, who represented the 10th Congressional District, announced less than a month ago that he was being treated for cancer. Despite the aggressive nature of the disease, he vowed a full recovery and promised to run for re-election this year. But as his condition worsened, he was flown back to New Jersey on Friday via a medical transport from Georgetown University Hospital.
"It's quite positive" for the schools, said L.A. Unified Supt. John Deasy, adding that the increased money comes from the state, not from district resources, during a period of sweeping budget cuts.

He is a project or a player for depth, rather than one who can fill and immediate need.
Born and raised in Summit, New Jersey, Reynolds grew up in a sailing family and is a member of Island Heights Yacht Club. “There are a bunch of great local clubs and good sailors that came from that area,” said Reynolds. “We pushed each other to do well. I did a little sailing in high school. The team was me and my brother, and any two girls we could find to sail with us. We even made it out of our district a couple of times.”
First, the small stuff. Saving energy here and there will add up. Start with three simple changes:
The Bulls' defense was also stellar, limiting the Sixers to 31.8 percent shooting in the second quarter and 37 percent shooting in the half. Holiday, 1-for-13 in the first half, combined with Turner and the Sixers' other top guard, Lou Williams, to shoot 4-for-28 in the first two quarters.

“That gave us a huge lift right there,” Coughlin said. “It’s one or two times a year that play is completed and fortunately for us it was completed tonight.”
There is scant data on the number of small claims cases filed in the U.S. each year or on the number of cases that feature consumers suing big companies. A study by the National Center for State Courts, published in 1992, found 40 percent of cases in the 12 courts studied were consumer complaints. The same study found that 67 percent of individuals suing businesses or government agencies won their cases.
Sometimes it's hard to get to a performance on time. There are the vicissitudes of bad weather, human forgetfulness (speaking as someone who had to turn around on New Year's Eve and retrieve the tickets from the kitchen table), and people who aren't ready when they say they will be. MoDOT's the-public-be-damned approach to highway work has, of course, ratcheted up the problem by several orders of magnitude for a two-year span.
The black T-shirts depict a wilting white tulip missing its petals. Festival officials first started talking about ordering the merchandise in March, when temperatures were in the 80s. Then the weather cooled off and they were not sure when the blooms would appear.

Now, what's left of the bankrupt seller of extended auto service contracts faces an entirely new legal assault.
"He was an exemplary man, he was upbeat and always saw things positively. He saw a silver lining in every cloud," said Brubaker. "He was reliable, just a terrific man. It's very tragic, you hear about this news and you just don't think about it being one of your work family."
Bozmans has lived his whole life in Fort Collins, and he doesn't consider his college choice as an escape. "I love Fort Collins," he said. "If I go somewhere for jobs, I definitely want to come back here someday, even if it's retirement."
Three people were injured and more than 40 were forced from their homes as a result of three separate fires Sunday.
The Obama administration isn't entirely to blame. Anti-immigrant hard-liners have opposed even minor attempts to improve the detention system. Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, has criticized the new standards as a "hospitality guideline for illegal immigrants." Such rhetoric is irresponsible and ignores the fact that since 2003, more than 110 immigrants have died in federal custody. Smith opposes expanding the complaint system, for example, saying it provides too many options for detainees and no protections for federal agents who may be falsely accused. And he objects to providing female detainees access to abortions in cases of rape or if the woman's life is in danger, even though federal prisons provide nearly identical access.

"Here we are, rolling along, having our kids, having our fun," said Joanna Kerner, 42. "And then you hit a bump: OK, we can get through autism. Then you hit another bump: OK, we can get through autism with seizures. And then we hit this mountain, and we watched our family crumble."
Mexican presidents traditionally made a speech to Congress at its Sept. 1 opening. But the law was changed to allow a written report after opposition lawmakers prevented Calderon and his predecessor, Vicente Fox, from delivering an address in person.
As a member of the Mount swim team, Sosnovich set numerous school records, including those in the 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle. She served as the anchor on the record-breaking 200 medley relay team, which earned first place at last year’s Meet of Champions, and the 400 freestyle relay team that broke the record this past season.
The reasons to oppose goal-line cameras are subtle. We hate the ref, let him suffer! Why give him a get-out-of-jail-free card to add to his yellow and red. And soccer's animus will be bruised. The injustice of a ghost goal breeds grudge, one of soccer's favorite blunderbusses. The aggrieved are burdened. They feel robbed. Their opponents rejoice. And mock them. Revenge goes in the incubator.

The buyer will "welcome Vaughan employees into the Reser's family," chief executive Mark Reser said in a written statement. He declined calls for comment Friday.
There are pockets of hope. In Minnesota, resistance to building a new stadium for the Vikings has been fierce - so much so that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell popped in the other day to deliver a not-so-subtle message. He surely let it be known that he's got Los Angeles on speed dial, ready to send them another team if the Land of a Thousand Lakes won't agree to pay for more than half of a $1 billion stadium that owner Zygi Wilf (estimated net worth: $1.3 billion) just has to have.
A Trenton native, Locane now lives in Hopewell with her husband, Mark Bovenizer, and their two children. Locane’s attorney, Peter O’Neill, declined to comment after court. No one answered the couple’s home phone today.
A statement from the show's production company about the lawsuit said, "This complaint is baseless and without merit. In fact, we have had various participants of color throughout the series' history, and the producers have been consistently -- and publicly --vocal about seeking diverse candidates for both programs. As always, we continue to seek out participants of color for both 'The Bachelor' and 'The Bachelorette.'"

CLEVELAND, Ohio - The Cleveland Browns need a running back, wide receiver and an offensive tackle. They could use another lock-down cornerback, are thin at linebacker and their quarterback is unproven.
Jets owner stands up for QB - New York Jets owner Woody Johnson defended the work ethic of embattled quarterback Mark Sanchez and said he thinks "everybody's a little frustrated" after the team failed to make the playoffs.

Zimmerman was charged after a public campaign to make an arrest in the Feb. 26 shooting, which has galvanized the nation for weeks. Some legal experts had expected Zimmerman to face a lesser count of manslaughter and say a prosecutor will face steep hurdles to win a murder conviction.
"I think it's an entrepreneurial way to increase the amount of revenue schools can get from stuff that is of limited value to the team," Swangard said. "They can't be faulted for trying to monetize this, but it does reinforce some of the questions about people buying stuff for the stuff itself or because someone used it and that value."

The Kings were decent on the road in the regular season with an 18-13-10 record, earning 46 points, the 10th-best mark in the league and two more than the Blues got, but they've been something else at the end of the season. The Kings didn't clinch their playoff spot until the final week of the season, and they got at least a point in six of their final seven road games. After their two wins in Vancouver in the first round, that series was pretty much over, and they closed the series out on the Canucks' ice with a 2-1 overtime win.

Hey, Brian: Even if the Cavs bring back Shaquille O'Neal or Zydrunas Ilgauskas it will be for a lot less than they were both paid this past year. Will that potentially give the Cavs enough money to sign another big name free agent besides LeBron without sending their payroll much higher? -- David Feigenbaum, Hollywood, Fla.

Madaras and Ryan Watson, a four-star defensive end, were the Falcons’ only returning starters on the O-line. Crowell broke in a first-year starting senior at right guard and sophomores at center and left guard. Good Counsel typically ran behind Madaras’ side, and the 6-foot-6, 295-pound senior served as a mentor for the less experienced Falcons linemen. His finest moments, according to Crowell, came against Delaware powerhouse Red Lion and Manatee of Bradenton, Fla.

As for the timing of the vote, Rybak said in an interview that "we really haven't had time to make that decision. But it's likely that we'll do it on the 25th." Only Rybak can call a special council meeting earlier than that date.
This movie has a lot going for it: it is charming, lively, and brilliantly pulls off the gimmick of being a silent film. The problem is that it has struggled to find an audience (grossing a measly $24 million at the box office) and is, at its core, a featherweight love story. I still would like it to come out on top, but nothing would surprise me this year.
Romero, Gloria, D-Los Angeles: none.
In September, Senser's defense attorney, Eric Nelson, told the Star Tribune that Senser will base her defense on a recent Minnesota Supreme Court reversal of a man's conviction in a similar case where the state failed to prove that he knew he struck and killed a man changing a tire when he left the scene. The Supreme Court's 2010 decision in the case of Mohammed Al-Naseer effectively means that prosecutors must now prove criminal intent by drivers who leave the scene of accidents, said Nelson.
Being forced to repress their culture, she says, has resulted in shame, high rates of substance abuse, poverty and a loss of tradition.

We cannot police the planet. Bring the troops home now.

It's a treat to walk the beachfront path late in the day, checking out the fancy pools, the hammocks, the oversized checkerboard with the coconut checkers at the Kaanapali Beach Hotel, the entertainers working the patio at the Hula Grill in Whalers Village. If a sudden downpour surprises you — or if it doesn't — you can creep upstairs to the Whale Center of the Pacific, a well-appointed little whaling museum, full of arcane tools and impossibly detailed scrimshaw etchings from the peak whaling years of 1825-1860.

Hacienda Yaxcopoil, $60. This hacienda 20 miles south of Mérida, immediately identifiable by its double Moorish arches, is preserved but not restored, so its tours offer an especially vivid glimpse into the Yucatán's past. It's a popular stop on the way to Uxmal, but few travelers seem to know that you can stay in the guest house in back, a roomy building with colonial-style furniture and the original patterned tile floor. At night, you have the whole hacienda to yourself — slightly eerie but totally enthralling. For $20 per person, a motherly lady from town will deliver a home-cooked tamal dinner and dessert.

Q: I am amazed that no one has filed a class action discrimination suit against the banks for the fees that they charge people who still want their monthly statements mailed to them. It is, of course, reasonable that banks want to save money and the "environment" by having paperless statements.

Buck said he didn't know why he was fired after just three editions of what was supposed to be a quarterly show. Four episodes remained on his contract, and HBO Sports boss Ross Greenburg didn't get into specifics about the decision. The show drew good ratings but got off on the wrong foot in Greenburg's mind with comedian Artie Lagne's profane appearance, and there is a feeling among some that it was doomed from that point. Another train of thought is that it was too costly to produce.

The chow: The stars of the show are the breads and pastries. Of the breads, our favorite is the airy salt slab ($3.50). Think of focaccia. Strip it of rosemary, mushrooms, or whatever toppings you're used to. Lighten it by 10 -- no 20 -- percent. Then dust it with sea salt. If you can make a lunch of this perfect bread, then you're set. However, if you require more substance, one of the better options is the mild chicken sandwich ($8) served with an equally mild pickle. A fat chicken breast marinated in a green garlic, arugula and pistachio pesto is roasted, then finished on the grill and topped with a zucchini and corn relish and served on a seven-grain carrot roll. The chicken is bland but cooked to succulent perfection; the relish is both surprising and odd in a sandwich, adding neither sweetness nor serious flavor; and the roll is -- not surprisingly -- superb, with a pillowy crumb and bold exterior.

The plants, Russian thistle, are from Europe and they didn't populate the United States until the late 1800s, so if the movie setting is prior to that, the filmmakers are pulling your leg. I think sometimes Western filmmakers try to stuff iconic Western images -Monument Valley, saguaro cactus, tumbleweeds, rattlesnakes - into as many frames as they can.

Everything he owns fits in a single bag, and he's toting it from crash pad to crash pad, but he's not giving up. The heat's been turned off in his place and he doesn't have a girlfriend, but that's bound to change, eventually. Time is on his side, for now. He can hear the sands hissing through the aperture in the hourglass, but he's going to try to block it out. Okay, he can't block it out, but maybe he can drown it out with his singing. He's got his smarts, he's got his passion, and he's got his band. That'll have to do for today, because it's the only day they're giving him.

Midwest Generation is under intense pressure to clean up its Chicago plants, largely because they also are among the region's biggest industrial sources of lung- and heart-damaging soot and pollutants that create smog and acid rain.

Overall, when I used it, Star Service reviews were extremely helpful, and it doesn't seem to have changed much. Although different writers prepare individual entries, I get the impression that evaluations are fairly consistent and consistently fair. My criticism of them is that on inspection visits, hotels tend to schlep travel writers through lobbies, dining rooms, ballrooms, and luxury suites, with less emphasis on the run-of-the-house rooms that most of you would occupy. And some of the prose in the reviews is too purple for my tastes. Still, I'd say that the professional reviews could be useful for anyone selecting a hotel without prior personal knowledge of a destination or its hotels. Unfortunately, the subscription price, at $249 a year, is far too stiff for most travelers. The only practical way you can avail yourself of this resource is through a travel agency -- an approach with merit for lots of other reasons, as well.

There's no doubting the passion and talent of "Detention" co-writer and director Joseph Kahn, and you have to give him credit for trying to "throw a hand grenade into cinema," as Kahn puts it on his Twitter feed. Kahn touches on all the hallmarks of the typical teen horror film: the crazy party at the nerd's house, the prom, the idiot cops who ignore all the warning signs even as the body count rises, the BFFs who become arch-enemies, the outcast nerd girl who's virtually invisible as she pines for her cute friend, the blond bitch of a cheerleader, the hallway hijinks, the jerkoff principal. But Kahn spins virtually every cliche into yet another insanely trippy subplot. There's a stuffed bear that's actually a time machine, a strange guy in a hoodie who's been in detention for 20 years, a mother-daughter body-switch that leads to far too many 1990s references and a killer named CinderHella, which is based on the movie-within-a-movie "Cinderhella."

Utah has the kind of size that could give San Antonio trouble in the first round, but the Jazz could still move past Denver to No. 7, which would pit them against Oklahoma City in the first round. Three things would have to happen: Denver would have to lose its final two games, at OKC tonight and at Minnesota on Thursday; then Utah would have to beat visiting Portland on Thursday.

I would add, though, that Popovich's short-fuse moment came after his team handed the Blazers a victory (the Andre Miller-to-Nicolas Batum buzzer-beating alley-oop).

Anthony Davis and Andre Drummond. The NBA did ask for a new 20-year-old age limit, but that has been tabled, and whatever changes the league makes in its draft entry rules, it won’t affect this season. That means super-freshmen like Davis and Drummond will be on the board.
Photographs are more than just pictures. They capture special moments in your life, so you can enjoy them later. I've kept nearly all the pictures I ever took, even the ones with the ex. It is my life in these photos – mine – and I want to savor these recollections, the joyful and the sad. What were once bad memories can even change over time after old feelings associated with them have shifted.

Johnson’s words pretty much described the whole Nets attitude for the entirety of their final season in New Jersey. Thirteen of the 16 players on the Nets’ roster (including 10-day guy Armon Johnson), plus the head coach and general manager, have been with the team for two seasons or less, so the the whole history thing means little to them. The truth is, this whole last season in New Jersey hasn’t been about this season at all. It’s been about the future. It’s been about pulling out all the stops to try to get Dwight Howard – and thereby assuring they keep Williams, a free agent July 1 – and going into Brooklyn with two of the NBA’s biggest stars and a powerhouse team. That would be the best way to create a buzz and get the people there interested in buying tickets to their state-of-the-art arena, the Barclays Center.
The first-quarter gains were anything but an easy ride. Uprisings in the Arab world, a jump in oil prices along with the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis in Japan led to many deep one-day falls.
Felton’s name has come recently up in trade rumors, including several reports that the Lakers are interested in him. Felton said he instructs family members and those close to him not to pass on rumors.

Better yet, since you don't get paid for your time, the committee compensates you with food. Depending on the time of day when you judge, you can help yourself to a breakfast, lunch or dinner buffet, plus free coffee and snacks throughout the morning and afternoon.

“She was huge in the fact that she is a very strong runner, very strength-oriented,” Flanagan says. “She came in and adapted to Jerry’s program quicker than I did, and immediately made an impact in my training for New York.

If you haven't noticed a trend here, allow us to point out Umenyiora is putting the onus on the Giants. He's not saying he'll hold out or that he'll create a distraction, though he's also not saying he wouldn't take either approach. He said later on ESPN2's "First Take" last year's public fit taught him to "be quiet, say nothing."
