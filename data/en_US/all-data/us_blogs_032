At Pat's suggestion, this one was to be different from its two predecessors. Instead of the small sounding balloon, with its attached case of instruments, it was to be large enough to support a spherical gondola similar to those used by Piccard and other stratosphere explorers, in which Pat himself would accompany his instruments into the upper atmosphere.

This shouldn’t surprise us. Our God takes the barely noticed and creates world transformation. The first Easter was barely noticed: some women and then, reluctantly, his disciples saw the Risen Christ. Yet these encounters – so lacking in being noteworthy at the time and, therefore, so easily dismissed – have shaped the course of human history ever since.

Oh, and, if you are wondering about the bacon, THAT never happened.
Munchies:
I need to look at the bigger picture. Are they learning (some stuff) - yes. Are they happy - well, most of the time, except when their mum is making them do stuff that is really hard for them. Will they grow up to be well adjusted young adults - one can only hope and I think there is more chance of that if we homeschool, than if I packed them off to high school.
I miss places like Playland (I caught the last few years of it), but San Francisco is still the town where Playland was and still is in my mind. Growing up here was a treasure: the characters, the neighborhoods. No matter how far I go away from here, there's still a piece of San Francisco in me and I'll always come back.

I have long been keen on red wines from New Zealand and have often wondered why so many consumers are hesitant to try them and persist in regarding New Zealand as solely a white wine producing country and look to Australia for their reds. I do my best to win them round, but even at the Annual New Zealand tasting I spoke to two men who did not even want to try a Kiwi red – despite my best efforts.

Two nice-looking girls whose fair tresses are dressed upon their forehead come up to me and take me by the hand. Their aspect, nordic, misty almost and yet pure and inspired, gives me a feeling of peace.
I’m really happy that I ended up getting Whisper of Guilt. The golden tone of it is much easier to pull off with my fair skin than with Superb, which is also beautiful , I just can use bronzer with it because then it’s just to much color on the face and seems harsh. If I had to pick, I think these are the best of everything in the haul. It’s like you have the most amazing healthy glow on your skin. These are everything a highlighter should be.

Today is my blog anniversary and I'd like to celebrate with a very special recipe for a special occasion. I'd also like to thank blog visitors from all over the world for making me believe I'm doing the right thing. The making of these pages is not the easiest task - you need to bake, take photos, edit photos, write, translate. It's very time-consuming and it develops at a much slower pace than the one I had in mind when I was starting. But never mind, the most important thing is you're enjoying it and I'm enjoying it so let's get down to business.

And over time, as is the case with just about every useful statement, it was stripped down, turned into a nearly unintelligible manglement (Well, that’s a word NOW fuckers!) of its original self. It became more habitual than useful. It became a pile of verbal feces. Warm and steamy.

It is nearly synonymous that every school shooting or mass killing of some type is lucidly linked to the shooter taking antidepressants, but our precious lap dog media rarely if ever mentions this connection. Like the Bales case, it surely wasn’t difficult to link On Goh, the shooter who killed 10 of his peers at a Korean Christian School in Oakland California to antidepressants. This latest school shooting was just one of two in such a short year.

As for my mother’s own creative endeavours ... well, she never fully realised her ambitions there. Why? It’s not as if she wasn’t talented. In fact, I think she was really good. Good enough to have had an agent, and to have had a couple of things published ... but knowing her and her work as I do, I think there was a great deal more that could and should have happened, and never did.
Apparently there’s some election campaigning going on in America. Unsurprisingly for a country like the US all the candidates are claiming to be God fearing, sent of God, and anything but God-awful. This has lead to a number of posts on Christian blogs questioning and examining the various claims.
This is Carsten's (1967, p. 50) summary of Mussolini's June, 1919, political program, already mentioned. There would be very little in that which would not strike a chord with modern-day Leftists. Note that Mussolini was even a feminist by the standards of his day -- agitating for equal rights for women.
Wow! From the West Mall to college radio in a matter of months! Pretty cool! Plus it was a connection to Texas and to Austin that I was happy to make.
In the end, it comes down to August 14, 1959. That was when the US satellite Explorer 6 sent back the first picture of Earth from space. The enormity of this moment, however, did not sink in. Many people still think the first picture came almost a decade later, in December 1968, when Apollo 8 sent back its beautiful “Earthrise” photograph. Either way, it was a moment when something we knew in our heads became thrillingly, terrifyingly real in our hearts.

Within weeks of regularly attending services, my oldest child asked me to set them up an account on www.youversion.com . Dacey knew that I had used that site for my Bible reading plan and wanted to do the same. I scanned through and found a plan that seemed to fit: http://www.ownit365.com/ . What really clicked about this plan was the family discussion times it offered. I reset my plan so that Dacey and I could do this one together. The fire was lit. The rest of the family followed suit. We are now two weeks into reading with each family member having personal Bible reading in the morning and evening and then family reading and prayer before bed.

Unwrap the roast and place it in your crock pot, add 1/4 Cup of water and turn your crock pot on low and cook for 8-10 hours until the meat is fork-tender. Transfer your roast to a cutting board and discard all the liquid in your crock pot. Pull the meat apart by tearing the meat into thin shreds with two forks or your fingers. Place all the shredded meat back in the crock pot and toss with a full batch of my Beasty BBQ Sauce and heat on low for 60 minutes until hot. Serve and enjoy.

Go anywhere in Thailand, at any time of the day or night, and you will not fail to hear some form of music being played. The taxi driver with his Isan country music compilation, a night club belting out bass heavy RnB, Hip Hop and the latest mega sales electronica by artists such as Lady Gaga or Pitbull, you’ll find them all playing from dusk ‘til dawn. There’s no escaping it. Then of course there’s the huge and ever growing trend in Japanese and Korean popular music: ‘J-pop’ & ‘K-pop’, respectively. This self-contained cosmos of popular fashion, hair styles and scenester hangouts is a constant reminder that, as with so many other facets of Thai culture, the modern Thai imports his or her tastes from even further East. The ‘lakorn’ (soap opera) that show on early afternoon TV are nearly all imported Korean period dramas. Chinese TV plays a huge part in what Thais kick back to after work with a beer or ten.
Omer Arbel - There have been many. Once I was walking in a side street in Barcelona, and noticed our chandelier in the window of an anonymous apartment. It made me very happy and proud to know that the piece is illuminating some stranger's home, means something to them, but that I have no knowledge of who they are, what they do, what their relationship to the chandelier is.

My mother and I have been talking since late summer about the whirlwind weeks of my parents' courtship. Four, to be precise. They'd started dating in the final month of my father's senior year of college at a Canadian university, after which he started medical school in the U.S., on a campus nine hundred miles away. My mother still had a semester to finish and hadn't planned on moving to another country.

Gangs – how do gangs fit into the picture, for all the money spent by the Federal, State and Local law enforcements to eradicate gangs, the situation continues to worsen. Of course, that is given a helping hand by popular culture, and the notion that if one is categorized into a specific group, one has no hope of ever getting out of that “group” – it is a cast system that is based on nothing more than the need to drive elections. If tomorrow, the categories disappeared, and individuals were given the choice to be an American first, with all the advantages that implies, what would be the result? Until then, those who are supposed to know better, the politicians and the government, (who are hired by these same American’s categorized and pigeonholed), continue to look the other way, on all issues, or use those issues as a means to an end – reelection. It’s time to start helping parents – parents whose hearts are being broken every day by the outrage in this nation, by the violence against students, whether it be gang-related or bullying or hazing or some stupid right of “passage” designed not to inspire but to degrade, all with the unintended consequences that someone might end up with a life cut short. Someone who may have been a great doctor, or teacher, or business developer, or philosopher, or saint – one will never know, they were categorized, they were defiant in the face of no consequences to their actions, and they had no hope in a future – because they have been told there is no hope by the aforementioned.

It wouldn't do our looming economic crisis any harm, either. These figures I've seen come from Tom Lloyd, the former chief constable of Cambridgeshire police: "It's estimated that we spend about £10 billion a year on enforcing the drugs laws and that criminals make up to £6 billion profit a year. It is also estimated that up to 70% of acquisitive crime is committed by users seeking to fund their habits (ca. £16 billion)." If those are accurate, there should be more than enough to spare for rehabilitation projects and training schemes.

Compelling, sad, poignant... Hannah Baker committed suicide and left a note of sorts, in the form of cassette tapes. With insight and understanding beyond her teenage years, Hannah recounts the people, experiences and interactions that led to her death. Each person she holds responsible will receive the tapes and hear their impact on Hannah's life. A map accompanies the tape, allowing the listeners (and readers) a tour of Hannah's last few months and the places that were significant to her.

And, more seriously, my replacement box of checks is still AWOL. As is typical in the service industry these days, the company where I placed my order refused to take any responsibility for their whereabouts. Why didn't I use the mail tracking option when I ordered, they asked? If the only way you can be assured of receiving your checks safely is with the extra cost of the tracking system, why even offer a non-secure shipping option, I shot back. I may have to cancel the entire set if they don't show up shortly, and I AM NOT PAYING for that. I have had very lengthy arguments with bank officials -- in my head -- where they end up meekly giving in to the superiority of my argument. (I suspect the real conversation will be much different).
Last night was Monday, which means that I headed to my living room head bowed, wondering what technicolour torture awaited me under the pretense of being House, MD, a television show to which I am hopelessly addicted. What keeps me coming back? Is it Hugh Laurie’s really good fake American accent, is it Robert Sean Leonard’s perpetually sensitive-looking expression? Is Charlyne Yi’s awesome and hilarious performance as Dr. Park? Is it the writing?

Once the event that caused the response is over, the stress itself isn’t gone. Soldiers come home from battle with post-traumatic stress disorder, for example, a lingering memory bringing back their stress even more powerfully and repeatedly than when it was first felt. Closer to home, sitting in a traffic snarl while commuting to and from work can create a low-level kind of stress that is constant and nagging.
My best friend, as deluded as he’s always been, has gone completely over the wall on the Nationals. As often as I tell him it’s an aberration having something to do with the Mayan Calendar ending, he refuses to believe me and insists the Nationals will get to the playoffs this year. Now that they’re sporting a more typical Washington Nationals 5 game losing streak, maybe my best friend will start to feel reality returning.

It has been substantiated that young children and teenagers process the experience of vicarious violence differently than adults. They are more likely to form patterns and lasting behavior based on their experiences, even the vicarious ones like video games. But for the millions of kids raised on video games there are very few instances of video-game-dictated violence being committed in the real world, and none where the video games themselves are the culprit. I think it is reasonable to say that a violent video game may fuel an already violent tendency, but it will not create one. Unhealthy people are motivated by many different stimuli to commit violence. David Berkowitz claimed that a talking dog motivated him to commit the Son of Sam murders. Any psychological profile of a serial killer informs that sociopathic behavior is almost always rooted in the relationships within the nuclear family, or in scarring experiences in the real world. For the great majority of us, video games are an outlet, a neutral experience that is as healthy as the person is who engages in it.

I got the digital paper and image from Doodle Pantry Digital Doodles. These went really quick because I kept em simple and used the "assembly line" technique. Was able to make this whole set in about an hour and a half. There's 3 or 4 basic designs and the rest are duplicates. I also used raffia (to resemble the hay) and a Martha Stewart punch for snowflakes and dew drops for the centers. Here are some close-ups of the styles.

Some have referred to this thesis as dark and pessimistic. Some have even suggested it as unpatriotic. Yet, I hold that America is in decline, a natural cycle of all great empires. At the same time China and Islam, among others, have awakened and are rising. Their emergence should be viewed as their own natural cycles of ascension.

WOODEN FERMENTING VESSELS There are 7 old wooden vessels which are very acid and the wood soft and dirty, and, in my opinion, quite unfit for use in their present state. Owing to their construction it would be very difficult indeed to copper line them satisfactorily. I understand your Brewer could do without them if new vessel were in use, and the best thing would be to remove them altogether. The new white cedar vessel almost finished should be put into use as soon as possible so as to enable your Brewer to do away with old vessels.'
This team will certainly cause its first-round opponent some headaches with its depth and blistering pace of play. Ty Lawson has been playing great all year, Arron Afflalo is firing on all cylinders right now, and Danilo Gallinari is finally healthy again. Although their model of star by committee is unprecedented, letting whoever is the hot hand take over in crunch time, it is also unproven. That and the fact that they give up 101.2 points a game, second-worst in the league, truly hinder their chances at making a deep playoff run.

As a general rule, never do something now that you have to make up for in the future. It almost never works out that way. Remember the theory of willpower? Right now your body wants to eat whatever it can get down. You say no, and it fights you. Letting it win only fuels that little toddler inside you. When it's time to go to the gym tomorrow and your body doesn't want to go, what's it going to do? Fight you. Just like a toddler. It already knows it can win, it did last night.

I finished Mockingjay last night. The three books are actually a single book printed in three volumes. I suppose a 900+ page novel would appear too intimidating for the young adult readership -- unless it was the last book of the Harry Potter series. Any way, if there is anyone left who hasn't read the books I highly recommend consuming them successively for the full effect of the story arc.

I am toying with the idea of having a termly hang out time after sunday school for the parents to come and literally hang out with their kids and the sunday school team. I see it as a family zone, something which brings families together as themselves and with each other. Something to pray on and think on some more. I also want to bring in some parenting sessions; not to teach parents (heaven forbid) but to share experiences and learn from each other; the way we would have done as communities in generations gone by and seem to have lost the ability to do.

Although the room is small, we luckily were able to squeeze in a double bed, in which I've been sleeping since Toby was born. (As a new mom, I can't handle being a hallway away quite yet!) To spruce up the bed, Jenny made the blue-and-white striped fabric headboard. Bonus: It's really soft and comfy to lean against when I'm nursing Toby at 2a.m. (and 4a.m. and 6a.m....)

Essentially, he points out that there is supposed to be an intrinsic unity between the Word of God in the readings, the homily, and the consecration of the Eucharist. Having layperson give the homily, he argues, breaks that intrinsic unity. He doesn't say so (for obvious reasons), but his argument applies equally, I think, to the permitted option in the OF (but not requirement) of the laity doing the first and second readings:

I can't blame them. "Canon in D" is an exquisitely beautiful piece. That up-down-up-down chord progression in the bass, that long and lingering stretch of downward steps in the melody that turns elegantly fluid as the work progresses. It has a natural rise and fall that makes it a perfect play on the emotions...and always tear-jerking when a vision in white walks down the aisle.

This is about Mitt, who appears to seek counsel about the economic toll befalling non-wealthy American women from a person who was also born into privilege, married into privilege, and chose not to enter what most of us consider the workplace. She is no more qualified to give advice on the subject of everyday economics than I, a childless man, am qualified to give advice on parenting.

And I appeal to you and the politicians of this country: Stop the idea of ruling people in the spirit of a long past time. Come join the present. Of course the conduct of policy must learn the lessons of the past. But it must also accept the problems of the “here and now.” And it must ultimately recognize that we cannot alter the past. The future, to be sure. Or, as Albert Einstein said: “The future interests me more than the past, because I expect to live there.”

Geneva Platinum prides itself on releasing great designs that don't cost an arm and a leg. This watch features a rectangular case as well as simulated leather strap. Numerals can be found around the dial and the time is kept with a Japanese quartz movement. Chic, different, and functional, this watch is a great buy and makes a great gift.

Grace is the ultimate forgiveness, freeing us with unconditional love and letting everything problematic melt away. Oh I know all too well how hard it is to forgive! but what a holy experience this affords. Eventually, we realize that the people in our lives have been reflecting our own issues, just as we asked them to. I pray that I may walk forward with the greater awareness of grace and receive this shining gift from above. And when I lose my way, and feel very separate and alone, may grace guide me back to our one reality of love.

Paris vs NYC? I honestly can't answer that question yet. You all know how much I loved living in New York and sometimes my heart aches to go back to the City That Never Sleeps. But then there are days where I'm walking around Paris, exploring something new or doing a repetitive errand that just keeps getting easier each time, when I look around and just can't get over how beautiful Paris truly is.

Motor skills refers to the abilities which involve the use of hands, develop over time, starting with primitive gestures such as grabbing at objects to more precise activities that involve precise hand-eye coordination. Fine motor skills are skills that involve a refined use of the small muscles controlling the hand, fingers, and thumb. The development of these skills allows one to be able to complete tasks such as writing, drawing, and buttoning. *
It was the most extraordinary of statements. Aldous was enormously impressed by it, and also very touched and amused. Of course he understood it. But I must have looked bewildered, for Krishnamurti, in a softer, calmer way, said, “It just happens, do you see?” Alas, I did not see very well. Krishnamurti continued, “I am not a healer, or a psychologist, or therapist, or any of those things.” The words “healer,” “psychologist,” “therapist” burst from him like projectiles ejected by compressed power. “I am only a religious man. Alcoholics or neurotics or addicts— it doesn’t matter what the trouble is— they get better quite often— but that is not important; that is not the point— it is only a consequence.”

The following column is reprinted from the January issue of Providence Monthly (including the stuff my youthful editors somehow deem necessary to leave out):
It's the tale of four sisters, part of an aristocratic Japanese family that has seen better days, in the years leading up to World War II. It is one of those novels that concerns itself with the details of everyday private life, rather than the grand, sweeping events of public life. And not only do the details give a picture of a bygone life in Japan, which I find fascinating, they also accumulate slowly to create a kind of realism that is really engaging.

Gussets are key. Some people believe that with larger breasts, you should lengthen your gussets, which means, deepen the cups, and place your breasts closer to where they naturally rest, right in the middle of your waistline. Gussets can be somewhat lengthened if you do it intelligently, and you cut an arc in the cup before you cut the slits in for the gussets. The trick really is to WIDEN your cups if you want to accommodate larger cup sizes. You should be building sideways, not up or down. You are broadening the platter in which your bust should
As the day progressed I could feel myself mentally checking out from the world around me, and focusing more and more on what was going on inside my body.

It was first cooked for us by our friend Chris, who is a professional sommelier with famous good taste. I think his original recipe calls for peaches, but he adapted it to the season with local strawberries. It's cooked enough so the alcohol isn't too overwhelming, and the sweetness is tempered with savory elements like coarse salt and nutmeg...y'all, it is just about perfect.
Thank you all of you who commented on my last post. This whole issue with K and the kids became a litmus test of sorts for me, and not intentionally. It surprised me to see who came out of the woodwork and expressed some amount of care and support for me and the situation. It was certainly disappointing to see those people who I thought would do more to help end up doing nothing at all. This definitely colored my view of certain people and who I thought they were, and made it hard for me to keep in contact with some of them because of it.

The kids have been up to their ears in homemade shaving cream shower paints. Have you ever smelt half a can of Barbasol smeared across a steamy tiled bathroom, mixing with the sounds of delighted squeals? Well- its about the opposite of awesome.I made the paint, delivered, and then slipped in and out to take a quick set of photos, then abandoning the entire upstairs for about 24 hours until the smell of musty/freshly shaven old man had dissipated.
Tasting first the venison with beer and wine in turn and then the beetroot I had a dilemma, this was not so easy. I found the venison went well with the beer and the beetroot with the wine, though I believe others disagreed. There was the option of voting for both or neither if one was not obviously a better choice than the other, so I found myself voting for both beer and wine with the first course.
The fabric flower was made with a facing from the jacket, left over fabric from the baby doll top and a button from the jacket. The striped edge on the flower, was originally the bias tape on the edge of the facing. A hair clip has been added to the back, so it can be worn either in the hair or attached to either the dress or the bag.

J: I’m glad you asked. Well Romans 1:18-20 states ” The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse”.

There is no doubt that the edict of the Saudi Sheikh (pictured left), which by the way was not issued for the first time, reflects a primitive mentality and ignorance in understanding the true spirit of Islam. The sheikh justifies his ignorant opinion by arguing that rising up against an oppressive despot would cause "fitna" which means division or tumult or confusion.

It’s like in Harry Potter. The wand chooses the wizard. Not the other way round. Likewise here. It may sound strange to some of you, but like the wands in Harry Potter, the pieces of jewellery she makes ‘choose’ their new owners. Ask anyone who has bought one and chances are they will say that they felt the piece ‘calling out to them’. In fact, at the moment, I am wearing the first necklace I ever bought from her. And it was calling out to me.

Here Duchamp has the correct vision, which has been an inspiration behind my style of literature on this blog, which is recreation of designs of forms to wrap around the traditional forms and their traditions, to liberate the chess forms from feudal and warrior terminologies, and replace such with magical, mystical, divinatory and moreover love storyland symbolism. Starting with the base of Conty’s symbols, establishing oneself well with the forms that history has bequeathed us and then recreating those forms, playing with those forms, transforming those forms precisely according to the rasa or taste of the chess games itself, in line with its moods, in the context of each of what Duchamp calles here ‘the struggle’, which even that does not have to be fixed and bound. One could reinterpret even Duchamp here, and replace struggle with ‘dance’, which too has an element of force in its motions as does struggle.

This coming of age story is utterly compelling and it is the type of book that is hard to put down. The reality of the sweatshop is so grim and so horrible that it is hard to fathom how any of it could possibly be true.... And yet, the author herself came from such a background, earning a bachelor's degree from Harvard and an MFA in fiction at Columbia. Although the book is clearly semi-autobiographical, I almost wish the author had written it as a memoir so I had a better sense of where the line between fiction and reality lies in this work. But sometimes truth is even a stranger tale than fiction.
Imagine the injustice of it all. There you are in the reincarnation line plotting the takeover of your next kingdom, mentally redecorating the pyramid, and wondering why they still haven’t opened a ’20 lives or less’ lane, when BOOM, some idiot pushes the wrong button and you find yourself emerging into the world as the youngest child of two common people who clearly did not get the memo on your past achievements, refined tastes, or highly detailed needs. ‘Bummer’ does not even begin to cover your disgust.
What was that boat? The Greek word is SKAPHE from which we get our English SKIFF. It has the meaning of being dug or scooped out, a trough or tub.

This is quite a contrast to the survey’s results one year ago when we saw just 18% bulls and 52.3% bears. The stubborn level of bullishness then is a bit worrying. But before we get too carried away, it is important to remember that there is considerable lag built into this indicator so the data we are seeing is already stale.

I also would not have to put up with a certain type of melancholy that was becoming more frequent – separating from people I’ve shared so many happy memories with. The 15th and 30th of each month were the days when inmates are released, and I remember the sadness of the past few… 15 June – 056/05 `Az’, the charismatic 42-year-old prefect from Setapak, KL I took over from. His boisterous laughter was a part of the hostel – often, we would hear it from a distance when returning from the mosque.
Since launching Acne Paper in 2004, the magazine’s editor in chief and creative director, Thomas Persson, has done far more than simply prove it’s not merely a glossy offset of the denim empire. This week, he’s in New York to fête the launch of the latest issue, number 13. And it’s a very fitting location for celebration—Acne is set to open its first flagship store and office (at 33 Greene Street) outside of Europe in Manhattan later this spring.
Satan was quickly catching up. He met me several times, right around that "it's never going to happen" corner, right down the "I'll never get enough money for this trip" hall, in the "I don't have the kind of friends it takes to help me" room. He was there the whole time. But my Savior is bigger! Uganda was on my heart in a whole new way. Almost a refreshing spin on the trip itself. I felt that I wasn't trusting God enough to provide and that broke my heart. My heart burned every time I thought about it. What was even worse is that after I decided that Uganda just wasn't His will, I got back on Facebook. I kept noticing a pattern in my news feed. My adoption/orphan advocate friends that are also fundraising were posting their triumphs and showing how God was raising their money for them. They would ask one day and within a couple days, meet AND exceed their goal. Where did their help come from? Where were my friends that were willing to support me? I couldn't give up on Uganda. That just wasn't like me. I realized then that it would be a full blown fight for Uganda but it would be His fight. I would just be His warrior :)
On my most recent trip to Portland for my brother's wedding, the stigma was alive and well with one of the groomsmen, who said he felt that craft in cans was simply not right.

Today I encourage you to make sure that your motions and your movements have a purpose that serves good things to you and everyone around you.

As you learn to relate to money as a flow, without clinging to it, as you learn to be receptive to the way that flow supports you you realize that money, like everything else, is here to help and support you. As you open to that support you may be surprised by the way money can show you your way to freedom, joy, and purpose.

8) Do things to try to encourage them. For example, I had a friend in high school from the Sudan and there wasn’t anyone else on campus who was from the Sudan. So I took him with me to the mission a couple times, he got to hang out with some of the Sudanese there, speak his language, talk about his past with people who actually understood it, etc. and it was a great time for him. He thanked me multiple times for taking him with. So look for ways that you might encourage a refugee. Life in a new country is never easy, and little things often mean a tremendous amount.

Unable to admit to any but his closest friends that it was his own work, when the dinner table conversation turned to the poem, and praise for its lively style filled his ears, it was almost enough to catch Rutland's eye and bask in the light of amusement and admiration that he saw there. Of course it bothered him that he couldn't admit to being its author, but already he knew that it was far better to have the freedom to write and publish than to take the credit and be told he was not to do it again. For no matter what he was told, he knew he would do it again.

Tomb of the Golden Bird by Elizabeth Peters, is the latest of the Amelia Peabody series. Convinced that the tomb of the little-known king Tutankhamon lies somewhere in the Valley of the Kings, Egyptologist Radcliffe Emerson and his wife, Amelia Peabody, seem to have hit a wall. Emerson has tried desperately to persuade Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter to relinquish their digging rights. But Emerson's trickery has backfired, and his insistent interest in the site has made his rivals all the more determined to keep the Emerson clan away. The family returns to Luxor and watches from the sidelines as Carter and Carnarvon "discover" King Tut's tomb. But before their own excavation can get underway, Emerson and his son, Ramses, find themselves lured into a trap by a strange group of villains demanding "Where is he?" The Emersons embark on a quest to uncover who "he" is and why "he" must be found, only to discover the answer is uncomfortably close to home. Now Amelia must find a way to protect her family -- and perhaps even her would-be nemesis -- from the forces that will stop at nothing to succeed in the nefarious plot that threatens the peace of the entire region.

It's a huge place, loads of shops, everything from H&M to Ralph Lauren, and loads of people. And I still could not find stuff I liked. I had to find shoes for an interview I had on the Monday, and ran around trying to find shoes I liked. When I found a pair, they were not available in my size. I eventually found a pair of Ecco shoes that were classical, simple, nice and comfortable. So I found the perfect pair in the end, but by then I had been looking for almost 2 hours. and my mood was at an all time low.

Because of how the children in Birmingham had been treated, the horrid pictures appearing on televisions all over the world, the back of Jim Crow was finally broken. The President of the United States at the time, John F. Kennedy, made a speech later that week saying that it was time for segregation in this country to end. He had not wanted to bother much with the situation in the South, but the thousands of children who would not be stopped forced him to have to deal with the ugliness of racism.
i have to say the girls' performances were just wonderful! so was the work of the school staff.. what really shocked me was the audience.. of course everybody was like 1.5 hours late, this is normal here.. but even when the action on stage started, women were still arriving and behaving as though nothing formal was going on - walking around, talking loudly, laughing and paying little attention to what was going on on the stage.. it all looked more like a dress rehearsal to me than an actual performance day.. this continued even when the principal was giving a speech but she didn't say one word to make them quiet, as if this kind of behavior was normal

Fire in the Cave contacted me about reviewing their two-song self-titled EP. The band's name refers to a famous thought exercise by Plato, questioning the nature of our knowledge about reality. I've always thought Plato's philosophy was stupid, but this music isn't. It's raw, heavy sludge/doom out of Florida, with a blues flavor and extremly angry growls, plus some black metal influence on standout second track "Aeden Carr." That one is plenty dynamic in just about every way, so this EP is definitely worth checking out. I give it 4 out of 5 stars, and look forward to hearing more from this promising band. It's a name-your-price download, so get on it.

This film was screened as part of a series at BAM curated by Lena Dunham as part of the lead-up to the premiere of her new HBO series Girls—and really, if you want to get a sense of Dunham's inspiration, see this film, then watch the HBO series (which premieres on April 15) and compare notes. Thankfully, Weill's film—which Stanley Kubrick reportedly loved, and which film critic Robin Wood definitely found of interested, at least based on his mention of it in a chapter of Hollywood from Vietnam to Reagan...and Beyond—has more of standalone interest than the Dunham connection; it's one of the more sensitive depictions not only of female friendship, but also of personal insecurities, adult compromises and the struggles to make ends meet in a city like New York.

This individual described the procedure of placing hands above the head and turning side to side before continuing through the portal. I had to ruin this individual’s day by informing them that the unit was the nudie scanner which I drove about 6 hours to avoid. (a flight was available, but I chose to keep my dignity and yell at the stupid drivers) This individual’s response to that realization was, “I feel so violated.”

Friday’s high (low) point was the stand up argument between my mother and uncle over the bill.

Like so many Irish jockeys, Geraghty has a background in pony racing, riding his last winner in that sphere in September, 1996, before becoming apprenticed to Noel Meade that month and having his first ride in October, 1996. He rode his first winner aboard Stagalier at Down Royal on January 29, 1997. It was for trainer Jessica Harrington that he first sprang to prominence, partnering her 1998 Midlands National winner Miss Orchestra. Geraghty will forever be associated with the great Moscow Flyer who provided him with his first Cheltenham Festival victory in the 2002
Because "Prepping" or being a "Prepper" can have lots of connotations and definitions (from being a survivalist to someone who cans and puts up a larder), I think it's important that I periodically point new readers to my posts explaining my stand on this topic.

Jordis Unga, Alone – I’m a fan of this song by Heart, but Jordis kind of sounded like she was holding back to me. I really like Jordis, but this wasn’t my favorite performance. Christina didn’t look impressed either, but thankfully Carson didn’t ask for her opinion this time. Blake told her that her performance was the opposite of playing it safe, so I guess he didn’t think she was holding back at all.

Following the GA's inability to reach consensus on this subject, those of us on both sides of the debate were tasked with further discussing the issue. Cynically, I found myself assuming the people we had been debating weren't actually committed enough to the process to enter into further conversation. However, immediately after the meeting, one guy came over to continue the discussion. Within a few moments, a group of a dozen people were talking about how power functions, how Latin@ folks are racially profiled as undocumented immigrants, the policing of trans folks (especially transwomen of color), the precariousness of service industry workers employment, and so much more. Here we were, mostly strangers, spending our Friday night standing in Duncan Plaza engaged in political debate.
He entered his home studio in November 2009 not knowing if fellow band mate Doug Martsch would even be into his idea which would require him to re-sing all the songs. With one rule "synthesizer and drum machine only" he started and soon had "I Would Hurt A Fly" nearly done and sent a rough mix to Martsch who quickly agreed to re-sing all the songs. Emerging eight months later with one song off of each Built To Spill record done local friend and ex-bandmate Jon Mullin (The Suffocation Keep) mastered the final mixes that Nelson and Martsch had completed. Brett's son Nicholas did the cover layout/art with anagrams of the original titles provided by Stephanie, Brett's wife.

And I have to agree with him, especially with regards to the light heartedness of the book. Beckett can be funny, yes, but it’s a certain kind of humour and it often goes over the heads of people. Perhaps because his protagonists are often octogenarians (if they can even remember their ages) and seem to exist outwith a time and place that most of us can relate to. There’s not one of us who hasn’t been sick in bed and that’s a very familiar place to start off with. This book is not Beckett-lite or even Joyce-lite; it is its own thing even if it’s not ashamed of its influences.

However, some nations, especially in the last two decades, remained stubborn and have refused to alter their banking systems while also shunning Western companies. Despite the empire’s best efforts to diplomatically bribe or sanction them into submission, they ultimately required an iron military fist to force their compliance. Until recently, military action remained the last resort. But now, preemptive military action seems to have become the preferred, and perhaps necessary, method to conquer the last resource-rich nations out of their grasp.

“In India, he is personified as elephant-headed Ganesh, who writes the story of existence with his own broken-off tusk. In Egypt, he was Thoth, the ibis-headed scribe. the earliest Babylonian cultures portrayed him as Nabu. In the voodoo pantheon, he is Legba; to the Celts, he was Ogma; and Viking mythology knew him as Odin, the one-eyed god, from whose shoulders the magical ravens – thought and memory – fly hither and yon to bring the god instant knowledge from all corners of the cosmos. In 1940 Hermes just couldn’t resist showing up in person to join in all the fun as his fellow gods were reborn on paper.”

One lazy Sunday afternoon, propped up by a generous array of pillows, I spent a lovely lazy hour lying on my bed. The soft tunes of Madeleine Peyroux fluttered in the background as I perused blogs and devoured recipes, while sipping from a never-ending mug of Russian Caravan Tea. The sun was peeking through my gloriously large bedroom window, gently kissing the crown of my head and encouraging me to chill my tea with a few ice-blocks. I did not oblige, however. I've never been a fan of ice-tea.

Being envious and jealous of others seem to be part of human nature. It is from the drop of jealousy and envy that we draw our ambitions and goals in life. From the tiny drop of envy and jealousy we develop admiration and inspiration. If used in a constructive way, it can serve as our motivators to push through in achieving what we want or even do more because we admire others who are able to get to where we want to see ourselves in a span of time. So we make them as our inspiration to motivate us in succeeding too. However, in most cases, a person gets consumed by his/her envy and jealousy. Instead of developing it to admiration and inspiration, it becomes anger and hatred. And sadly family members are not an exception. Many may be opposed to this but in fact envy and jealousy are pretty common among families and relatives. Normally they don’t show it, hypocrisy is the common practice. They may show you happiness and support for your success but deep within them are their insecurities that is developing to an overwhelming envy and jealousy where covetousness is likely to flare-up. Nevertheless, there are really those who have pure intentions and are really happy for a family member’s success.

Whether you view Allen as a hero of the people who saved Britain from civil war, or the sneaking and treacherous letter-thief who prevented the accession of the true King to the throne will depend on your sympathies; Tory or Whig, Catholic or Protestant. Either way there was no doubt of his significance. It is a strange fact, though, that locally he is known only as postmaster and quarry owner. His role as spy is not general knowledge. But I have, of course, cast him in my latest book in this secret role.

First of all I want to thank everyone for all you have done in standing behind me. Although the comment that was made stung hard and hurt deeply I was remind that for the one jerk off, there are 1000 of you who are full of compassion and true caring. So thank you. I am happy to say I will be not making my blog private. How can I let the comment of one so ignorant affect the legacy my daughter has laid out? I did however make some changes to my settings. No longer can 'anonymous' people make comments, and I must approve all comments before they are published. Although I can't control who reads, I can at least control those who decide to give there unsolicited advise. I'm sure she won't be the last to make an ignorant thoughtless comment. I can only hope she read through the many comments from all of you readers and felt extremely small and insignificant. Mostly, I hope she was educated in her very self-centered and small minded vision. Not only did she offend myself, she offended my friends and family, other BLM's as well as all those working moms out there- both career and SAHM's. So again, thank you for making me realize, she doesn't deserve my anger or attention. But it sure felt good to stick up for myself!

Forensic psychologist and horror-cultural journalist Katherine Ramsland's latest book considers the scientific possibilities and psychological implications of vampirism, from its literary genesis in Bram Stoker's Dracula to the present day. Ramsland's Piercing the Darkness: Undercover with Vampires in America Today chronicled the modern cultural impact of the vampire. Now she broadens her inquiry to examine vampire mythology and practice in scientific terms, taking the reader into discussions of psychoneuroimmunology, endorphins and psychedelics, psychopathology, and other areas of science and metaphysics.

There are many ways to draw down the power of the Moon, but we wish to suggest two ways. The first is an ancient Celtic tradition. Let us say that you are going to do a Full Moon ceremony, although the same instructions will apply to any other lunar ceremonies. If you are going to do the ceremony out-of-doors, which we recommend, because when one can actually see the Moon, it makes a very strong connection more possible and probable. Looking at the Moon is taking in its light through the eyes. You see it light, its brightness, and its beauty. If you are going to do your ceremony indoors, it will not be totally ineffective, but it will not be a strong as it might have been had it been done out-of-doors. You may wish to use a tree stump or a log as an altar, or just a space on the ground. If it is a Full Moon ceremony you should use a white candle, and for a New Moon ceremony use a silver candle. During the Dark of the Moon, use an indigo-colored candle. The candle serves two purposes. First, it imitates the light of the Moon. Second, it provides a small amount of light for your ceremony to occur. White also is purity, strength, and power. Next, obtain for yourself a silver bowl of any size you choose. We ask that it be made of the metal silver. Fill the bowl with pure water. Place the water on the altar or on the ground. Then, with your right hand you will charge the water. Hold your right hand over the water and circle it around the bowl in a circular motion, clockwise, nine times. Next, take the left hand and holding it over the bowl, move it in counterclockwise circular motion nine times. Next, hold your hands together in a gesture of receiving (palms up) and part the palms slightly. Look up at the Moon, and take in nine deep breaths. To exhale the breath, blow it into the bowl of water. This creates Moon Water, which was a common practice among Druid priestesses. It is now sacred water and can be used as an offering to the Moon itself, for healing of the body and/or emotions, for massage, for drinking, or for any purpose that has to do with change, birth, renewal, endings, and death. By the time the next Full Moon has come, if there is any of the sacred water left, pour it on the ground as an offering to Nature. You may also choose to bedeck your altar with white flowers that you make or buy.

One of the really neat things for people who have read Clare’s earlier series is that there are a few familiar faces. Many of the supernatural beings that exist in this world are immortal, so even though a couple hundred years separate the two series these characters are able to exist in both. It is a nice treat, an added bonus, but certainly not necessary to ones understanding, so people who have not read the other series miss out on nothing that is happening.

I don’t remember exactly what happened next, but I do know I was dashing for the icebox to attend to the oncoming edema when, out of nowhere, I was hit in the back of the head with the Makati telephone directory. I hit the freshly waxed floor and blacked out. Before I lost consciousness, I faintly remember Shane yelling at me “Mahal mo ba ako???”, over and over again.
This is one hell of a possibility. I can't wait to see where it goes, where I will take it.
I actually refer to myself as babes when I talk to my mom, like “Babes wants some food” or “Babes wants Toochie (refering to my mom) to go home.”

Musical instruments respond to their environment and to the exuberance with which they're played. It's their nature to go in and out of tune. Out-of-tune strings resonate at incompatible frequencies. They sound bad. They're "out of phase." Tuning your instrument brings its various tones into phase.
I try to shrug it off and walk away. Because that’s what your teacher told you to do, ignore them, right? After all, they didn’t know where I lived. These girls lived across town. And this was the time before GPS, before texting and cyberbullying. At least at home I would be safe.
If these do not work, then a doctor will prescribe a stronger medicine. There are also a lot poisons shampoos for killing the insects. The eggs hatch in over 7 days and 2 days later it reaches the stage of first nymph. They live directly on the scalp where they can be cared for in the heat, every requiring lice. If lice infestation is severe, the skin is prone to dryness.
I cannot give him 4 stars because he was being insubordinate. EVIL HOSTAGE. So, with that being said, I give him a 3 out of 4 stars.
I doubt it. Few people feel strongly about this show. I can’t sense a momentum that would necessitate giving it another shot even though the ratings weren’t completely awful. They were just regular awful.
But before I head into healthy-recipe season, I want to share the last of the fried recipes from Chrismukkah dinner. To say these were crowd-pleasers is an understatement. They disappeared just as quickly as I could set them out.
"No," I explained quite truthfully,"I don't have any cards in my running clothes. I just carry a very small amount of money." (Quite true - my cards were elsewhere).

“Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. 13 Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, 14 I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.”

Alarmed by the precarious nature of spent fuel storage during his recent tour of the Fukushima Daiichi site, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, subsequently fired off letters to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Energy Steven Chu, NRC Chairman Gregory Jaczko and Japanese ambassador to the U.S. Ichiro Fujisaki. He implored all parties to work together and with the international community to address this situation as swiftly as possible.

Ellie has power that no one can match, and her role is to hunt and kill the reapers that prey on human souls. But in order to survive the dangerous and ancient battle of the angels and the Fallen, she must also hunt for their secrets of her past lives and truths that may be too frightening to remember.
When I first started college in 1976, I was accused of sounding just like Ayn Rand by a school library clerk with whom I had frequent friendly ‘debates.’ I had never heard of Ayn Rand before, so I asked her to show me an example of Rand’s works. They didn’t have much, so she handed me a copy of The Fountainhead. Whew! Let me tell you, reading that book was like seeing my very own soul, in clear and concise language I couldn’t hope to equal, poured out on the pages before me. I was absolutely dumbfounded! Without going into unnecessary detail, it was the story of a man who stood against the merciless tide of collective humanity out to destroy him for his unwavering stance in favor of his individual right to live as a free man – by his own standards and at his own expense. It was after that that I knew!

For several more years I fished all around the Miami area; anywhere my bicycle would carry me – all along the 79th Street Causeway, at the fresh water canals out around NW 27th Avenue and 103rd Street and in Hialeah along the banks of the Miami River – I never carried a camera. It was hard enough just to carry my cane pole or my rod and reel and a tackle box on my bike. My stepfather took my mother and I on some more but truly unforgettable fishing trips during this period of my life, too. Like the time we got caught in a hurricane while trying to cross Card Sound in a 16’ wooden boat powered by a 10hp outboard motor (the weather had turned so bad Truman brought the Presidential Yacht out of the ocean and anchored it in Card Sound to protect it), or the time we got stranded in the middle of Blackwater Sound when our rental outboard failed to start and we couldn’t find the entrance to the fishing camp at Jewfish Creek in the dark of night. The mosquitoes were voracious and we had to jump overboard into the murky water in order to retain our sanity; it was like a scene out of the African Queen! But, again, we have no photographic documentation.

I would love to experience the opening scene in chapter one from Lauren’s point of view. All heck is breaking loose and the hero, Ford, rushes in to save the day. Who wouldn’t want some tall dark and menacing Damphyr King to bust in and whisk you away on his back to keep flying hell demons from killing you? Very sexy!
Then carefully insert the flaps from the base into the slots so that they can fall over and completely cover the picture you drew. You may need to enlarge the slots slightly if it doesn't turn easily. You should be able to turn the middle circle to reveal the picture or hide it.

Magnify the Lord! I’m not going to get into the questions that might be popping into your head. Questions that would like to discredit this scripture by looking at the current state of the world. Sin is the root of all evil. Sin looks out for itself and leaves a path of destruction behind. We can see this destruction everywhere we look. We see a world that is quickly deteriorating because it will not yield to the original plan of a giving God; a God who has the best interest of His children.

When I followed her through the bathroom door I was shocked to find myself walking through the promenade of a gigantic arcade. On both sides of the walkway, which seemed to extend to infinity, were countless adjacent studios, each occupied by humans acting out some kind of drama. Every studio was furnished to appear like part of a domestic home: sometimes a lounge, sometimes a bedroom, sometimes a kitchen and sometimes a garden.

Then off to a seminar on deafness and disability, with a huge panel of speakers, including Ros and Children's Laureate Julia Donaldson. Had to dash away before the end of that too in order to make the Tweet-up, which was congregating in the - guess where? - Illustrators' Bar. Now, for the benefit of those who don't use this method of communication, a Tweet-up is a meeting in real life of those who know each other on Twitter.
I'm also so proud of Ariel. She started back into physical therapy last week and has had three sessions so far. Even though it's painful for her, she's going and making the most of it, and she's been great about doing the home exercises. For those who don't know about why Ariel would be in physical therapy, she had heart surgery in June 2008 and had some sigificant complications following surgery. It has beeb a long recovery for her, physically and emotionally (but probably even more emotionally). She also has scoliosis in her back and significant hunching in her back as well as knee, ankle, and elbow joints that allow for too much movement of the bones within the joints (joint laxity). We have been told she has a nonspecific connective tissue disorder, whereas most of her bodily tissues tend to be too thick and also affecting her spinal alignment and joints. In physical therapy, she is workking on strengthening of her back due to muscle atrophy. She generally has poor muscle tone, but it is also common following open-heart surgery for people to develop kyphosis (hunching) because of the trauma to the sternum and long healing time where those muscles are not in use. She is also working on strengthening of her low back and hips as well as knees and ankles. I just very proud that it was her idea to start back into PT and that she has been dedicated to it thus far, as she has been emotionally unable to handle these things since surgery. I can't wait to see her get healthier and healthier, and to flourish into who God intends her to be!

Another version of salad is this; which in some version uses raw fish/sashimi as an additional ingredient and is known as 'Raw Fish salad'. The Pasembur is different from the Rojak as the ingredients consist of usually fried items such as fried prawn crackers, fried beancurd, sliced cucumber, flour rolls served with a type of sauce made with grounded nuts. Toss sesame seeds on top of it and it is ready to be consumed.

It’s unclear what “He’s the most – guy” means, but everything else soundsfantastic - Especially the interplay between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. Not only does Downey’s Stark want to be a jerk to Ruffalo’s Banner to set him off, but Banner kind of likes it, too. Could Stark be jealous of Banner? Is he unhappy because maybe he’s no longer the smartest guy in the room?

Matt 28:18-20: Jesus approached and spoke to them, saying: “All authority has been given me in heaven and on the earth. Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded YOU. And, look! I am with YOU all the days until the conclusion of the system of things.”
Here's the deal: I'm not a total scaredy-cat. Really I'm not. But I do have an overactive imagination fueled by horrible novel selections by high school English teachers (who really should have known better) and poorly chosen television viewing habits in my university days. I am not a conspiracy theorist, but I do sort of expect that there could very well be danger lurking under every bush.

Hitchcock then gives us a literal birds' eye view of the surroundings, as we see first one and then another and then another gull enter the frame, as they stare down at the destruction below. The birds let out a shriek, as though they are having an ironic laugh at humanity. We can control humans so easily, the birds seem to be saying. What a chilling image and moment this is!
Poverty, economic condition in which people lack sufficient income to obtain certain minimal levels of health services, food, housing, clothing, and education generally recognized as necessary to ensure an adequate standard of living. What is considered adequate, however, depends on the average standard of living in a particular society. People without access to education or health services should be considered poor even if they have adequate food. One of the main sources of poverty is lack of educational opportunity.

For example, your base class is the Sith Inquisitor. When you reach level 10, you choose one of two specializations: Sorcerer or Assassin. These two specializations play differently from one another, but share some similarities. Furthermore, you have your talent trees — a Sith Inquisitor (Sorcerer) can spec into Madness, Lightning, or Healing. Each “tree” changes your playstyle somewhat, and afford new talent-only abilities.
Neil Richardson (1994) asked how much Paul’s language and understanding of God changed after his conversion to Christ? On the one hand Paul is deeply and profoundly theocentric – but on the other hand this very theocentric outlook was intimately linked to his powerful experience of Jesus as the climatic revelation of God. Thus Paul is both theocentric and Christocentric. There is a “vital interdependence” between Paul’s ‘Christ language’ and his ‘God language’. Richardson says,

This gearbox has been a long lead time project, Sam Michael told me the new case was planned as early as March last year and the hard worked CV joints and driveshafts are designed and made by Pankl. They have no worries about the set ups reliability, although the joints are installed with such an extreme angularity, that they would either rob power or reliability with a normal design joint.

And that whatever I (or anyone else) decide to do with my time, be it studying biology, hiking, learning Latin, watching bugs crawl up stalks of grass, or (even!) playing video games, it all has value.
This is the first time the charity has released its internal data on its youth programs. Officials said the report is meant to show the need for continued public support for children’s programs.

The sources said the DA is worried that any CFB findings might interfere with the criminal case against John Haggerty Jr., the Republican operative charged with swiping most of the $1.2 million that the mayor channeled through the state Independence Party last year for an Election Day ballot-security operation.A veteran election lawyer said that it was a violation of both state election law and CFB regulations, since the chief beneficiary of the donation was the mayor's campaign and not the Independence Party, which was supposed to keep only $100,000.

So you can see why I was gleefully announcing on Monday to my Facebook friends that I had written a chapter! And on Tuesday, I’d written two! Hallelujah! The only reason I managed that was because I ring-fenced December to write! Ho, ho, ho! (again) So what will next week hold? Well – Monday and Tuesday morning I’d booked for writing – but unfortunately, the lovely woman who was going to arrange the publication of stories that my creative writing group wrote in the summer has been ill ever since – so I’m going to make my first venture into Lulu publishing and do it myself. Hey ho – maybe another chapter the following week then….

One of the most prominent African baboons lives in Zimbabwe. His name is Robert Mugabe. This specific species is notorious for its remarkable ability to wreck an entire country in record time. Several members of this same species have managed to swamp the government structures of South Africa. It’s only a matter of time before they too will have wrecked SA, in a similar fashion they brought Zimbabwe to ruin.

This is why the challenge of same-sex unions is so urgent and important. Redefining marriage is never simply about marriage. It leads to the redefinition of reproduction and parenthood, produces a legal revolution with vast consequences, replaces an old social order with something completely new, and forces the adoption of a new morality. This last point is especially important. Marriage teaches morality by its very centrality to the culture. With a new concept of marriage comes a new morality, enforced by incredible social pressure and, eventually, legal threats.
So I can still grieve for what was and what has been lost, but the grief is only mine – and once I am gone and those of my generation who will remember the great nation that we used to be?

We started out as eclectic homeschoolers. My mother bought a few different programs & books from different companies, and encouraged both my sister and I to use them. But even in those early days, she was pretty relaxed, and when we didn’t want to do something, when it wasn’t working for us, it was generally fine with her if we stopped doing it. The only thing that was ever really an issue was math, because for a while, my mother still felt that math had to be “taught”. I think we became true unschoolers when we realized that there really were no “exceptions” to the concept: through simply living, following your passions and interests and curiosity, you really can (and do) learn all that you need to know, including math.

Friday...I went for my CD3(cycle day 3)(sorry any men that read this) ultrasound and blood work. They called me Friday afternoon and everything looks great and that I should start my injections. Yes, that means I am giving myself a shot every night BUT the process is SO easy and the needle is SO small so no biggie. Joe planned on going into work after my appointment but didn't. :o) Our neighborhood does a community garage sale a few times a year which means they put out an ad in the paper and a bunch of signs with a map of where each home participating is. Then, you decide if you want to do a garage sale and set-up like a normal garage sale at your home. So pretty much you get the advertising for free as you don't have to put up signs or an ad in the paper. We set-up and "opened" at 8 am and I left at 8:40 am for my appointment. I got back at 9:30 am and things were hopping! We ended up selling so much that we didn't even "open" up today(Sat.). Joe decided to just work from home which was awesome! He had a few concalls but spent lots of time with us. We got PF Changs for lunch(my fav), took a ride on the golf cart, went on a bike ride, and a few other fun things. The weather was out of this world! Low 80's, NO humidity, sunny, and a nice breeze! We were literally outside from 8 am until 1 am. I should say that it was the ADULTS that stayed up that late NOT the kiddos! We had some good friends over so it was fun to sit out back in the nice weather. So all in all a great day with my boys, friends, a bonus of extra cash, and of course the fact that we got rid of stuff!!!

I was living then on about five/six hours sleep a night, which I'd done for many years. I was rather proud of that in a dumb way, but one time I fixed a videocam in place for an event we were filming and crossed in front of it and looked back at the lens, so it recorded my face looking into the camera.

Uhmmm. Anyway. The plan to win Pinky's mother's love is failing, but Pinky's certainly falling for Ratan, who fills the Dad-shaped hole in her heart. Ratan, however, is dejected that he can't get to Seema, and so he goes and gets wasted and then DRUNKENLY STUMBLES INTO THEIR HOME LATE AT NIGHT. How many frickin' red flags can a story have about a character? Anyway, Seema chides him, avoids him, but then, when Pinky is HIT BY A CAR one afternoon when Ratan is picking her up from school (by parking on the other side of a high-traffic boulevard), Ratan and Seema are finally united, basically because Pinky insists she needs a father.

The base had been nearly cleaned out in the time since Kenneth regained consciousness.

Later in college, my parents were kind enough to give me a copy of the OED on CD-ROM. I’m old enough that the software itself actually came on and had to be run from a 3.5-inch diskette, with the CD holding the data. This put the whole of the OED at my fingertips and led me down all sorts of fun lexical paths (such as taking up a professor’s challenge to find the one-syllable word in English with the most letters).

It's because the State Bar system is set up on a complaint-driven system. And one of the things we talked about at that symposium yesterday was getting judges to file complaints when they see this, getting prosecutors in their own office to file complaints against people in their own office that they've seen do this, would help the State Bar discipline these people.

The pocketbook attached with Velcro and fit right in with JJ’s leash and pink color scheme. Last night, my dispenser ran out of the last roll of purple bags. Unfortunately, Mom forgot to reload this morning. When I did my solid business, she scooped with JJ’s PINK bags. Oh, the embarrassment, pink Mom, PINK! You couldn’t figure something else out?

In Hotel Series Campbell carefully collages tiny circles cut directly from images of hotel interiors from different cities. Each dot is placed on white paper in the same layout as the original photograph and in each case Campbell has only selected one blue, one yellow, two browns, and a black; creating a new reading of these photographs through her ambiguously seductive minimal constellations that reflect upon the banal nature of international interior design.

Today, this has been making the rounds:
Here's what we celebrated this past weekend:
Dave had a happy grin with a gap between his upper teeth and his eyes flashed when you mentioned his proclivity toward bedding any woman with a pulse. He had gratefully accepted the nickname "Plunger" that the other Brits on Kibbutz Ginosar had bestowed upon him. I was called "The Young Gazelle", an ironic moniker since I was the slowest runner on the soccer pitch, laid low by a self-inflicted machete wound early one day as I attempted to chop down a banana tree.
OMG 2 posts in one day?
You might have noticed my swag didn't actually reach the entire length of the banister. It's close, but I want to decorate the rail along the hall upstairs also, so I better get back to work. Especially if I want to make extras to put in the shop!
If only I did as much doing as I do contemplating. I would be a happy woman! I'm glad to say the coughing bug is at last fading, only to have been swiftly replaced by another...
And there was no question that Gavin would be Batman! He's been planning his Halloween costume since last year! I think it's shaping up to be his favorite holiday! (He was not in a picture taking mood!)

The Film does have some good points in that the visuals looked very good so you can watch it and believe what’s going on. The effects used appear to be a mixture of puppeteer working and CGI which works well for the fighting and the human interactions that needs to take place. The fight scenes have no stamina and last no longer than a minute which makes you feel that either they ran out of money for effects or they have never seen a real boxing match (or for that matter Rocky) because the fights just appeared to be the first robot to punch the head which is just boring without a fight.

Katana has been on my to-read list for a long time and I think it's easy to say that this was one of those books that I was disappointed in, but still thoroughly enjoyed. Whilst there was SO much potential for this to be a fantastic read; reincarnation, samurais, fighting, a little romance... It was delivered unsuccessfully.
Sixteen thousand years ago, while on Atlantis, we violated galactic law. After a disagreement about how to handle an approaching comet–the remnants of which are scattered throughout four states–the descendants of Martians decided to separate from the Atlantians. They created a powerful energy field that went totally out of control and nearly destroyed the earth. We were on a very high level of awareness at the time, far beyond where we are now, but by committing this illegal act we fell many dimensional levels until we landed in this current, dense aspect of the reality. There are no accidents, however. In the cosmic scheme of things, this “fall” was necessary in order to allow for a greater possibility. We are now about to leave this place of separation and return to unity-consciousness. The whole world is. We have only a short time left before we will no longer be in separation. This is not going to be happening someday; it is happening now.

Add that to the fact that our pool has been the worst pain in the behind this Summer. The algae has attacked the bottom and I can't remove it. It is STUCK like super glue to the bottom. The water, on the other hand is BEAUTIFUL....clear as glass. But it's gross to see the bottom coated with algae and I really don't want to swim in that. I'm thinking of getting rid of the pool all together. What a chore that would be to take that thing down, not to mention the beautiful deck that is cemented into the ground....*sigh* I guess it's really not something we can take apart, so I have to deal with it. Looks like if we want to swim, we're gonna have to get a new liner AGAIN. Just did that 2 years ago.
This is the beginning of a series to explore photographing saguaros.

Many thanks to Candy Gourlay for agreeing to this interview. It’s been a real pleasure watching Candy reach publication and a thrill to hold and read her book. I wish her huge and exuberant dollops of success with Tall Story and the manuscript she’s currently working on. Yes, that does mean I’m getting sneak previews. No, I’m not telling you about it! Not just yet, anyway…
No one here probably remembers me, Levi the Schnauzer. I’ve grown up and haven’t been blogging. But something happened I want to share with the world because it hurts so much. My daady died! My human daady died and I’m so worried because he went to the Rainbow Bridge without his wheelchair. He needs that chair and Moomie just took it to a place called Goodwill. If they really have good will they’d bring it back and bawl my moomie out for leaving it there.

Light neutral pink sheer base with cool pink duochrome shimmer and sparkling silver microglitter. The silver microglitter reminds me of lightly sprinkled sugar.

Here is the difference between Auto White Balance & Custom White Balance. Notice the shifts in black. The entire image had a blueish tinge to it when shot in AWB. Even the wooden surface did not exhibit any wood like appearance. I set a ‘Custom White Balance’ & voila! The natural colours are back. Both the shots were taken at Standard Picture Style in Canon EOS DSLR & were unedited for this demonstration.

I am part of that niche industry and therefore I care about what these groups of people say. If there is something that we don't do and feel we are unable to do, but there is comment that it should generally be done, I feel bad. I think that I care too much because it drives me to distraction, far too often, from the general good running of the business.
A fascinating book titled, The Unthinkable researches and discusses the reasons why some people survive in terrific disasters and some don’t. Crucial, among other factors, is preparation because it replaces the panic stage with action. And in crisis, timing is often the difference between life and death. Preparation provides you with knowledge and strength to manage extreme situations. Preparation is your foundation.

I would love to have another season. This is a solid show, that has consistently good gags. I say gags, because every episode has 3 to 4 running jokes that are silly, in a laugh out loud way. When it hits emotion, it usually does so well. This is easily one of the top ten comedies on TV right now.

The Schwarzenburg family bought the Ossuary in the 1700s and commissioned a woodcarver to redecorate some more. He added a coat-of-arms and a chandelier made from every bone in the human body.
Soup is easily my favorite comfort food. Soup is healing; soup is comforting. Soup is a ‘set-it-and-forget-it’ and pretty difficult to mess up. Making your own soup can be beneficial for your health, as well. Canned, boxed, frozen and dehydrated soups, more often than not, contain hazardous amounts of sodium. The sodium levels in most store bought broths are also loaded with this dehydrating, bloating ingredient. Sure it can be delicious and addicting, but high-sodium diets negatively effect your skin, blood pressure and kidneys.
I was having one until today. In so much, that I got the packages out to my kids in time for Christmas and that was about all the Christmas spirit Duane and I could drum. We were ok with that. We even made a joke of it. Every time we thought about putting up our mini tree, Duane would think meh, and I would think bleh. So we called ourselves the anti-Christmas elves Meh and Bleh.
Orphan Go Mi Nyeo is a nun-in-training with little awareness of what is happening in the world outside her church. Her twin brother, Go Mi Nam, is set to join the hottest band in Korea – A.N.Jell, led by the cool Hwang Tae Kyung . When an unfortunate accident puts Go Mi Nam out of commission for a month, the band’s manager begs Mi Nyeo to take his place – without the knowledge of the other band members. Though unwilling at first, Mi Nyeo realizes this is her chance to find their mother, who disappeared when they were born. As she tries to find her mother, she must also learn how to deal with emotions of love as she grows attached to the lonely Tae Kyung.

Fort Collins offers a "Haunted Tour" of Old Town and I have been interested in taking it for awhile. Imagine my surprise when I found out the owner and founder of the Haunted Tours, Lori, offered a paranormal workshop. I signed up. It was a three hour long "class" and we discussed some of the research, studies, myths, etc. of the paranormal and then headed out to a supposedly haunted site.

To make the meatballs, mix together turkey, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Roll into 1.5" diameter balls, then roll in flour and drop into sauce. When the sauce starts to boil, turn it down to low and let simmer, covered. On the stove, cook for three hours, stirring about once an hour so the meatballs don't stick to the bottom. In the crock pot, cook for six hours on high. Makes at least 25 meatballs, depending on how large you roll them.

James at 15 (subsequently changed to James at 16) is an American drama series that aired on NBC during the 1977-1978 season. The series was preceded by the 1977 made-for-TV movie James at 15, which aired on Monday September 5, 1977 and was intended as a pilot for the series. Both were written by Dan Wakefield, a journalist and fiction writer whose novel Going All the Way, a tale of coming of age in the 1950s…. Protagonist James Hunter (Lance Kerwin) was the son of a college professor (Linden Chiles) who moved his family across the country to take a teaching job, transplanting James from Oregon to Boston, Massachusetts. James, who had Walter Mitty-like dreams and dabbled in photography, had a hard time fitting into his new surroundings. (SOURCE: Wikipedia)

Last thursday me and Jo from goldrush popped down to Kings Road, near Sloane Square to see all the jewels at the wonderful new Azendi shop. We met up with Sarah and Lisa there who are both on our sister course at uni. Such a small world. Lisa took us around the store and showed us some fabulous jewellery. My personal favourites were the shaun leane and stephen webster jewellery and the sick twina watches (more over toy watch). We chatted, drank cocktails, got abit tipsy (drunk), had a nibble on some sushi and had a grand night. Even ronnie wood turned up to see what was going on. The store is beautiful and all jewellery looks spectacular in it. If your ever in london you should definitely venture down to 104 kings road to have a look around. Its an beautiful area.

In moments when I find myself not cherishing the time we have together I'm learning to say a little prayer, not only asking for help from God but thanking him for my son and the blessing he is to me. It doesn't give me more energy, but I have found it can give me courage to face the day, remembering the blessing the my little boy is, even in the moments when I'm wondering what zoo he escaped from ;)
Mary GrandPre didn’t do the illustrations for Pottermore, but I’m OK with that. The illustrations for Pottermore look like paintings (but they might be drawings – I haven’t been able to find out what they are yet) and they’re beautiful. Occasionally, a scene is too dark in my opinion, which makes it hard to find things or even to know what’s going on. In a Pottermore review on another nerdy blog, the author mentioned that Pottermore was quiet in the beta testing period. It is still in beta, but now they’ve gotten rid of that silence issue, as I discovered when I had to mute the sounds of the website to continue listening to my Harry Potter music. You can hear the owls and cats on Platform 9 3/4, for example. So sometimes I listen to the Pottermore audio, and sometimes I listen to something like this, which I am currently obsessed with.

So sorry it has taken me so long to post again. Not too long after my last, I learned that our school staff was going to be shifted around. After 17 years of working with first graders, I found myself facing a teaching assignment for a fourth grade classroom. While, it is not the stuff dreams are made of, I am dealing with it. The move was refreshing in one way-it forced me to streamline quite a bit, so I ditched a lot of things I was holding on to-"just in case". Then, last week my principal resigned so we have an iterim for the remainder of the year.

It ludicrous that Tod Slaughter is so little known. He’s a horror star and his name is Tod Slaughter, for Christ’s sake, people should be all over that. Yet, in the grand scheme of general horror history he is all but ignored and the mass populace would not recognize his name or image. (I feel his pain, it’s hard being me and Tod.) It was alleged that whilst filming Marathon Man Sir Lawrence Olivier in reference to Dustin Hoffman staying up all night in order to play his character as having stayed up all night in a scene said, ‘why don’t you try acting, darling, it’s much easier.’ Tod Slaughter tried acting. He tried acting with glorious abandon. He tried acting with every limb, every muscle and with every fibre of his being. He tried acting so hard and so big that there was really wasn’t a screen or stage anyway capable of containing him. And while he may not be that well known, may not be lauded and may not receive the accolades that go to his peers, those of us lucky enough to see him never forget him and love him for it, and that is his legacy.

Magical thinking, in a mental health context, is the irrational belief that one action or series of actions can affect something entirely unrelated. As an example, when I was small, I took the “step on a crack, break your mother’s back” nursery rhyme very seriously. I worried that I was a terrible child and that, if I stepped on a crack and something bad happened to my mom, it would be my own fault. Therefore, carefully avoiding cracks kept my mother safe.

It is well known that from prehistoric times right through to relatively modern tribal societies that people would adopt a creature as theirs, the symbol of their clan, and so hope to acquire some of its power. The tattoo dragons that modern people love to have on their bodies are simply a manifestation of the urge to be bigger, better and stronger than the rest.

Mr. Gingrich gives us a glimpse into both by his assault on activist judges. He has ramped up the rhetoric – far beyond its traditional mooring in the importance of presidential elections, because presidents populate the judiciary.

We don’t want to look at our own shadow, because we’re afraid of what we might see. But the only thing we should actually fear is not looking at it, for our denial of the shadow is exactly what fuels it.”

She turned her heart-shaped face towards him. She was naked of course, facing away from him at first. He paused his reading to admire her more attentively as she eased the shining parts of her soft female machine into a semi-profile. He could see the smooth hillock's outline where her thigh merged with her hip; he could follow the reptilian arc of her spine from its lower dimples to a small inverted triangle of fine hair at the nape of her slender neck where she had tied up the black tresses to keep them from getting too wet and pinned them secure with a white butterfly clip; he could, and did, admire the outline at the soft fall of her small, perfect breast.

They have had published two papers which are available on the ITC website. In these two theological papers they have written that the Catholic Church no more teaches exclusive salvation. Since there can be those saved in invincible ignorance (LG 16) etc. So there are known exceptions to the dogma extra ecclesiam nulla salus.
Today, for some reason, the concept of 'learning' keeps popping it's head out everywhere. Most of what I know, I learned as a child in the Kavango ... my 'teachers' were mostly the true inhabitants of that part of the world - the Kavangos and the Bushmen. Other figures played a role as well - my parents, a school teacher here and there and then the amazing characters that this part of the world produced. My greatest teachers, if I really think about it, were the Stillness of Nature, because it helped me 'remember,' and some four-legged friends.
Reading the WEF report, one might get the impression that Germany would dangerously increase its CO2 emissions and cause problems for global warming by moving away from nuclear power. The evidence the WEF report cited, but did not appear to print in its report, indicated Germany may be able to reduce its long-term CO2 output to pre-1990 levels, with some sacrifices. This would be a major victory for science, not a setback in any way; the WEF report appears to show this as a negative (see Nature article here). Long-term is, without question, the most important consideration, not levels over a few years which may have no great overall impact. How many total tonnes will CO2 have been reduced? If all goes well, despite some temporary increases, the decreases in CO2 will be enough to compensate for them.

Europe’s two biggest low-cost airlines, easyJet and Ryanair, have no plans to drop their charges. Ryanair collects £6 per passenger, per flight, for debit and credit card payments; the fee can be avoided by paying with the airline’s own-brand Cash Passport pre-paid card.
He stressed that in order for these groups to be formed, society first needs to understand what practical benefits modernization brings.
I just could not resist Joanna Sheen's latest CD (if flowers could talk).
And that’s really the strength of Apocalypse Now. It’s a movie less concerned with telling a story in the Vietnam War and more interested in allowing us to experience the feel of the war through something more impressionistic. Willard is little more than a passive observer for most of the movie, and we are reduced to a similar role, bearing witness to any number of terrible things, of amazing things, as we head deep into the similar dark place Willard finds himself.
Earlier in the campaign for the May 3 election, Mr Livingstone was criticised for channelling his income through a private company to reduce his tax bills, despite describing people who use these kind of legal tax avoidance measures as ‘rich b******s’.
“Having the Craft Brewers Conference come to Austin is a fantastic opportunity for the local brewers to showcase our beers,” says Chip McElroy of Live Oak Brewing Co. “We Austinites are proud of our town and the local things we have produced — especially music and beer. We just had the SXSW music conference in town, now bring on the brewers!”
Mexico's President Calderon is already not a fan of the president because of Fast and Furious, which illegally supplied arms to the drug cartels strangling Mexico and resulted in over 200 murders of Mexican nationals. My sources tell me that President Calderon asked some pointed questions about what the U.S. was doing to investigate this, punish the officials responsible and clean up the mess President Obama's justice department created, and that the answers were less than satisfactory.

So, if you have a child that is not a baby but who still can benefit from wipes, I wholeheartedly recommend this product. And just for the record, Walgreens did not ask me to review their product, and provided no product or compensation to me.

First to Venus because it is most like the earth in weight and size and, except for the moon, comes closer to us than any other globe. Scientists are convinced that the planet Venus has an atmosphere, but it is composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide, with no detectable free oxygen. No evidence of water vapor has been observed, hence the surface of the planet must be largely desert, with no rivers, lakes or oceans.

Another problem is that we are not getting the essential nutrients that we need daily. They even had to change the food pyramid guys, so with all this contrasting information, who are we supposed to believe? My biggest suggestion would be to take a multi-vitamin that releases throughout the day. A lot of the vitamins out there will last about 20 minutes, and that doesn’t give your body enough time to absorb those nutrients that it is craving. So, here’s just a quick run down of some of the basic vitamins, what they do, and then I’ll let you all decide what you’re lacking and what fits well within your lifestyle.

First things first, why oh why does Silence not pop up when you search for it on GoodReads? So not cool because this was a great start to a supernatural series. I loved that Emma was allowed to be smart and caring, and that while she admits Eric is cute…there’s no insta-love in sight. Emma is still dealing with the death of the boyfriend, as well as the general drama of a teenage life.

Someone told me that it was going to take a lot of patience with myself and self love to be here. I assumed that she meant for the first couple of weeks. I can see now that this patience and this love need to pervade all else for the entirety of my time here. And I’m working really hard at that because I am harder on myself than I will ever be on anyone else. Harder than anyone else will ever be capable of being on me. What that’s manifested itself as is a silent scolding and questioning of any non-positive, unappreciative, anxious, or sad thought that shows up inside my mind. But being here in a new culture, those thoughts and feelings come up a bit more than usual. I’m a terribly positive girl, but you stick me in a situation as challenging as this, and the story tends to change a bit. That’s hard to deal with because one of my most defined identity points is my positive and perky personality.

The bass is rock solid, the pace of the music moves forward like a locomotive that will not be denied. The recording is multi-tracked to the max but this is done in a way that makes the performance easier to digest instead of more difficult. Voices are well placed at the center of the mix and band banter between tracks help to keep the listener entertained, even when the boogie takes a break! Instruments do not wander but occupy their own space, as in life. Detail is present and it is easy to follow the progression of any single instrument. On "Human Condition", for instance (my favorite track), you can listen to Mike Mann's rhythm guitar chords mixed deep during the chorus, and then, as he steps forward to solo, the sound just comes forward with him. This is exactly what I hear in a good blues club from a band that knows how to play. There is a natural homogeneity of sound, until it is time for something to stand out!
4 Taboos
In the early 80s my career took a significant change of direction. Throughout the 80s and 90s, I became totally focused in composing and producing music for film. I was enthusiastic and passionate writing orchestral music, totally engrossed. It was also a great feeling being welcomed and acknowledged by the industry and to be awarded many times for my work throughout the years.

The theory says that babies can hold within their little bodies, the stress from a traumatic birth experience or even from a mother who was stressed during her pregnancy. Both issues of ours. So there is deeply-rooted stress. Then there are the everyday stresses, such as developmental milestones, or just being unable to work a toy correctly. If the stress isn't released, well, it remains stored in the body of course. And so the Wildflower is carrying all this stress around with her all day, and then taking it all to bed with her.

Once I'm all done with coloring my image looks flat (see the comparison below). Although my colors are rich, they just don't have any excitement to them. This is where we add back in the white. Using my smallest paintbrush and some Opaque white I add the snow, glints of light, and other highlights back in. Wow! What a difference white makes. Don't use this only on snow scenes, try this on any picture that looks too dark, or flat. Just go in and add highlights or glints of light back in. This works especially well on metal things (someday I'll show an example).
Saturday we went to the King Tut exhibit-- a wonderful treat from our ever-thoughtful hosts. Words cannot do justice to the experience, but I will record two of my impressions here. 1) Remarkably, our youngsters were able to hang with an hour and a half of the exhibit. 2) The craftsmanship evident on some of the artifacts is surprisingly primitive while many of the artifacts show a breath-taking degree of perfection. One must wonder how they were able to create with such precision all those centuries ago.

After the normal force, it’s easy to follow right up with the friction force (really just two parts of the same interaction, but that’s a little beyond where we’re starting right now, huh).

Some Iranian lawmakers have suggested that it’s better for Tehran to sever its ties with Abu Dhabi so that the tiny Emirates may learn a lesson not to interfere in Iran’s internal affairs in the future and refrain from making provocative statements about Iran’s territorial integrity. Iran’s Army Commander Ahmad Reza Pourdastan has also implied that all options are on the table vis-à-vis those who question Iran’s territorial integrity: "if the sedition is not resolved through diplomacy, military forces are ready to show the prowess of the establishment to the claimant."

There is no traditional climatic scene you might expect in a sports movie. Rather, you have to return to the "electronic world" (as Gerald would say) to finish the movie experience. Yep, at the end of the film on the big screen, a website address is displayed and encourages the viewer to go online to find out more, a gimmick that may be a foretaste of things to come in this modern movie-going age. I can't help but think that one day we may be seeing a code on the big screen for us to wave our phones and tablets at for a more "connected" experience.

… that any person able to win a coveted slot in The New York Times’s regular op-ed stable with license to opine on the economy would have a certain basic knowledge of economics and, in particular, would have done enough reporting to understand the causes and solutions of today’s economic problems, particularly inasmuch as we experienced something similar decades ago and know what worked and what didn’t back then. Indeed, one would think that a pundit in such an exalted position would be both able and willing to do the minimal reporting necessary to relate accurately the salient facts relevant to the situation about which he opines.

The easiest way to solve this problem is to allow more room for the pipes to expand and contract in wall cavities. VinZant says copper piping can expand significantly when heated and needs room to grow. Placing insulation around the pipe, removing debris or cutting a larger notch in wood framing for the pipe to run through are solutions for this problem.
Twin Falls is formed by water gushing from a steep hillside and tumbling 65 to 80 feet into the Caney Fork. Twin Falls did not appear until after the construction of Great Falls Dam. The Collins River is immediately behind the hill from the Caney Fork, and it is speculated that when the dam was built forming Great Falls Lake, water began seeping into caverns thought to be inside the hill. The water had to go somewhere, so it proceeded to ‘leak’ out the other side, forming the falls.

My only beef about the case is that the leather seems to wear rather quickly. I know bright shiny leather never stays that way (at least, not without a lot of tender loving care), but I am already seeing some significant cracking, and I don't think I've had this case out of the box more than half a dozen times. (I only use it when I'm wearing a suit.)

One of our favorite memories of Scotty is from a trip we took to San Luis Lake. Scotty was young and was walking with us -- off leash -- when all of a sudden a jackrabbit popped up and Scotty took off after it. We'd never seen him run so fast as he darted about trying to keep up with the rabbit. The rabbit outran Scotty after only a few minutes, but when we caught up with Scotty, his whole body was quivering with excitement and the joy of running free. I hope his days at The Rainbow Bridge will be filled with plenty of happy times such as this.

If you talk to pretty much anyone with tattoos and ask them about photos of their body-art, you discover that despite paying hundreds (or more) of pounds/dollars/euros for their tattoos, the best photos they have are taken with a phone, or on a cheap camera in poor lighting with a flash that obscures half of the image. Ask them if they’d like a professional photo of their tattoo(s) and they all say yes, without hesitation. What mostly stops them is fear of the cost, and the opportunity.

The only time I’ve agreed with Andrew Marr this year was when he said three Sundays ago that the entire Titanic centenary jamboree is boring, tasteless and merely another disgusting attempt by Mammon to grub up some money. Looking in a WH Smiths at the weekend, I was stunned by the repetition of the word ‘Titanic’ on every shelf, in every magazine, and on the cover of every film review. And almost as tedious, hardly a day goes by without at least one financial writer referring to one economy, bank, government or another having ‘its Titanic moment’.
Also within Independence National Park is the National Constitution Center. The name fools a lot of people, thinking it to be another boring, stuffy museum, but it’s not.

The public, on the other hand, can be easy to impress – at least in the short term. The media eagerly gives celebrity status to anyone who happens to catch the public’s attention, for good or for ill, but today’s media darling is frequently tomorrow’s goat. Like it or not, the media and the public have recently put the spotlinght on us, and want to make Naval Special Warriors into today’s celebrities – war heroes to look up to – and they want to make every guy who has gone through our training a steely-eyed war-hero, epitomizing all that is good in the American male.

Again, I'm not certain that the characters are sketched in and performed with enough depth for its psychological/philosophical concerns to resonate beyond our awareness of their place in the script's allegorical scheme. But then comes the film's final five minutes, when Manny and the warden finally have their date with destiny. As hellbent as he remains on not returning to prison, Manny's own sense of humanity finally kicks in as he heroically uncouples the lead train car—proving to Buck, who had failed at the task earlier, that the task could be done if he'd put his mind to it—and saves Buck and Sara from certain death while forging ahead with the fate he himself has decided upon.

By far, the eyes have the most to absorb here although the nose is certainly the runner-up! I could never be here without a camera because describing the beauty amid all the chaos that is SE Asia would be impossible! The magnificent skyline of Singapore seen from the Singapore Flyer, the beauty of the southern Thailand lagoons and limestone formations and white beaches with crystal clear water, the serene and surprising National Mosque in Kuala Lumpur, the silent parade of monks walking through hectic and never-stopping traffic of Bangkok – none of these things can be described without photos! And certainly, the people of Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, working, smiling, living life just like we do in America.
Kubrick's flair for unforgettable imagery and jarring juxtaposition is here in full force. The sexualized mid-air refueling scene that opens the film, accompanied by romantic strings. The maniacal visage of Sterling Haydn's Gen. Jack Ripper, phallic cigar clenched in his teeth. Slim Pickens' iconic ride on the nuclear warhead. The closing moments of atomic Armageddon, set sardonically to the strains of the traditional wartime anthem "We'll Meet Again" by Vera Lynn. No one will ever meet again, because the world is coming to an end--that closing tune mocks the manner in which the Western world clung to outdated concepts of warfare in a time when those rules no longer applied.
They can choose to do their homework and reap the rewards at school, or they can choose to avoid their homework, and suffer the consequences of turning in an incomplete assignment. There is no reason for us to yell and scream and try to persuade our children to do their assignments.

Besides, we can't remember our kids' names when we're mad and yelling and it's really hard to be in control when we have to spit out five names before we get to the right one!
When I started this page, since the photos were of different events in different settings, I needed to bring them together somehow. I started thinking about "shampoo" and baths, so I decided to use the blue paper in the Sweet Tooth collection to represent bubbles.

I combined both of these elements inspired by my photos (circles and flowers) to create the basis of my page.
You claim, without any cause I can find, that Obama lacks “humility and class.” And yet he put his campaign on hold for days to fly to Hawaii for a few moments with his dying grandmother, to say “thank you” for her work raising him.

Those white, conservatives who voted for him for president of the Harvard Law Review (with many others) note what a good leader he was, not cocky but sure, a class act.

If we trust the work of Carl Jung in personality typing and development, then you might find it valuable to look for complementarity. If you are very analytical, seek someone more of a “feeling” type; if you are a feeler, seek more of a thinker, if you are more intuitive, seek a more concrete, detail-conscious, sensitive person; If you are more sensate, seek an intuitive friend. However, be cautious of a person who is so extremely contrasting in personality type that he or she simply is not likely to be able to be in rapport with you.

As I go forward, I can’t help but think of where I started this second time around. In just three years I have taken my skill to unknown heights and found a real passion for knitting and the fiber arts. I know that there are people who don’t always understand why I would want to knit, but the best way I can explain it is the ability to wave sticks and string around and produce something that is a reflection of not only your talent but your time. Knitting has become not just a hobby, but an integral part of my life, it helps define who I am. I am not a person who knits, I am a knitter.

Every morning, Sophie had to get her Samson fix before heading off to her job at the Department of Motor Vehicles. It was the only way she could stand it. The place was a crypt of dead-end lives, both the people in the cubicles around her and those lined in front of them. The mindless waiting brought out the worst in people; they rarely smiled, and often raged about the smallest mistakes, never taking responsibility for the things they could have prevented themselves. The hours dragged until closing time, and then while her co-workers made their way to bars or warring spouses, she eagerly returned to her Samson.

Now brace yourself for re-entry into your memory banks of bad memories - here is the first segment of movies from 1985 that all deserve to stay forgotten. Let's remember them together (and in random order, no less...):
But one of the Wii U’s most hotly anticipated features is the Nintendo Network, a new online infrastructure that covers both the Wii U and 3DS, and it’s this which Crystal Chronicles could really use to its advantage – and, dare I say it, become the flagship franchise for Nintendo’s very own MMO arena. Yes, you heard me – an MMO Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles.

Opposition from two big gaming tribes in California – the Pechanga of Temecula and Agua Caliente of Palm Springs – have stymied approval in the California Legislature for the Quechan Tribe’s (Winterhaven, Californa) development plans for a new casino and resort complex.
It’s an interesting premise and probably true. But it begs the question, why is it so comforting to be reminded of what it was like when you were in-utero? Most people spend a very tiny fraction of their life in that state (there’s a sad story behind anyone whose fraction of time spent in-utero is not small) and yet common knowledge says that that feeling is something that makes everyone happy and content. I’m reminded of a song by Ane Brun:
Rolling your windy tides across the sky,

I think I’ll watch Sleepy Hollow afterwards, to keep my mind of things. I just want the new week to start, so I have things to do… I get stressed out just of sitting still. On monday I’ll meet with Sandra, my “supervisor” when I’m working at next weekends convention. On Wednesday my boyfriend is coming to me, it’s as well his birthday. There will be some events during the evening, wich I look forward to. And then, on friday, it’s finally time for PicaCon 3! I’m currently having a hard time to be psyched about it, since my planning of the friday is still quite muddy, but it will come again. It dissolves!
I spent the rest of the ride hoping that I didn’t run into her again. That she wasn’t laying in ambush waiting to put a branch through my spokes or tacks on the path. I wondered if I should have stopped and made sure that she was ok…
However the same setting does not always yield the same result. Below are two more examples. The colors in the first photo look unnatural.
In some children, one eye functions better than the other. When a child begins to depend on the stronger eye, the weaker eye can become progressively weaker. Eventually, the weaker eye grows “lazy” from disuse.
Here you are, my lover...
But what are we really dealing with here?
1. I was a stay-at-home mom and wife until the age of 51, when I was hired as a full-time teacher. I was probably the oldest “new” teacher in WV that year. Maybe ever..lol
I have only one rule when it comes to setting the table. Only real flowers, no exceptions. Ever.
*I’m still at a loss to figure out what’s going on with Rob and Jeor Mormont and the rest of the Night Watch as they’re staying with, as I’ve dubbed him, Creepy Incest Guy. So the dude sleeps with his daughters and kills any sons that are produced? I get that (stomach-turning as it is), but revealing the point of all of this at some point soon would be nice.

I spotted a recipe for CRACKLE COOKIES in a recipe book and thought I would like to have a go. I haven’t made biscuits or cookies of any kind for decades.

You need: one 16 oz. of cake frosting, one 12 oz. bag of chips, a little bit of salt, and an extract (I used vanilla, but now wish I had used mint - I loooooove creamy mint fudge). You can use any combination of chips and frosting, but I'm using vanilla for both.

Getting back to spices, there are some great tips on growing your own spice garden and how to store fresh herbs (I didn't know you could freeze them). Both suggestions I hope to take part in soon. I can imagine the garden being a relaxing experience, and hopefully next months book, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Meditation, will be relaxing as well.

I just want you to know I love you. Just because I am quiet does not mean you still do not spend every day on my mind and in my heart. You do. You always will. You are my beautiful daughter.

Sony is yet to confirm the existence of the PS4 games console, but it exists out there somewhere – you can be sure of that.
So I had my first party Thursday night. I know a little slow getting started, I'm not a great salesman and not pushy at all! So This is my first party, and overall I would say it went well. My hostess cooked the host pack of Garlic Lemon Chicken, Taco Soup Dip, and Mini Pecan Pie Muffins. I didn't taste anything, but I heard rave reviews. I try and not taste something unless I know we have more than enough to go around I would rather the guest get to taste it than me. Plus I am fairly confident a guest won't ask if I have had something if it was on the menu that night! I can always refer to the hostess for questions on cooking those items too.

Many have become dissociated from the daily rhythms of the Earth, forget to look nightly at the stars and their feelings seem divorced from reality –whatever that is. The thought of one’s emotions actively being influenced by the electromagnetic and orbital changes of planets in the solar system — let alone the distant stars — is often ridiculed as being naïve, even ignorant.
Theres only 2 months left until my children finish school. Back in November, Rene and I agreed it was best I stay living in the house after the disillusion of our marriage. In the effort to rebuild trust and maintain a healthy environment for a fresh start for everyone, I agreed, and stayed to help support her while she sought employment and maintain help with the kids, as well as make sure the kids school year was not interrupted by switching schools.
Mirza and Sahibañ’s love affair soon became the talk of the town. When Sahibañ’s father heard of it, he was mad. He would have none of it, and soon packed Mirza off to his home in Danabad. Also, a suitable young man, named Tahir Khan, from the same tribe, was found to marry Sahibañ, and a date was set for the wedding.
My mother who is very calm, collected, spiritually centered, and conscious of her role in the global family routinely watches suspense and horror movies. I always thought it was sort of odd and incongruous with what she projects to the world. I asked her about it one time and she said that she found it comforting to watch situations where people's lives are infinitely worse than hers. Her comment stuck with me.
In his fantastic book on the spiritual disciplines, Donald Whitney makes the comment that the best way to learn how to pray is simply to start praying. It’s not that reading books about prayer is useless, but you can learn all kinds of things about prayer and never put it into practice. There’s something about going before the Lord in prayer that is the single best learning experience a person could ever have.

The first Standardbred races were contested along long roads, with men challenging their friends to see who had the swifter steed. Often the streets of major cities were cleared and races conducted. That's why so many American cities have a "Race Street".
What? Oh! My apologies. Sometimes I just argue with myself this way. The doctors have informed my caregivers that I will be perfectly peachy just as long as I properly take my medicine... :)

“Those are the Elite boys of SA Police Head Office, known as Unit 19,” my supervisor explained. There was a noticeable hint of sarcasm in his voice.
There are a remarkable number of other studies which also fail to support the claims made. For example, in 2002 the University of Helsinki studied the effects of high and low intakes of vegetables and berries and apples on oxidation in subjects consuming diets high in unsaturated fatty acids. They found “no significant differences between the diets”

Over the weekend we entertained the idea of moving. down the street. again.
...under the judgmental pretending-not-to-be-judgmental gaze of my mother, I asked them to put the books away. This is really sad to me. This mother is forced to choose between pleasing her kids and pleasing her mother. She ends up sending the message to her kids that Grandma's wishes are more important than theirs, and her own. WHY? Why does the oldest person get to have it her way? Why does a mother (grandmother) still think she gets to call the shots, even when her kids are grown up enough to have their own families?
Pour the mixture into the prepared baking dish and smooth out the top. Carefully pour on the breadcrumbs, spreading them over the whole surface. Bake at 375 for 45 minutes to an hour, till things look bubbly and the breadcrumbs turn nice and golden brown.
In between the dentist and doctor appointments, I had a couple hours to kill. So I ran a few errands, and then went to the library. While there, I found a handful of new books (for me) and 2 new ones for Dusty.
So why not go all out and have a full day of Lord of the Rings bookclub/Hobbit party?
We wonder if we've got it in us. At least I do.

It's a chest, at least that's what we call it, it now sits in our living room and acts as a coffee table, desk for the kids to work at, a foot rest when we are watching a film, oh and as it opens (the drawers don't open) it also gets used as storage. Old furniture may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I like it.
Now the BBPA will doubtless claim that its aim is to highlight the rising costs and sinking sales of its members' products - but it is probably a good idea to remember that a significant number of its members are the big brewers and pub companies, which have a certain brewing and stocking policy that involves a lot of mainstream lager brands...
The ship’s engines pulsed methodically, vibrating the deck underneath the purposeful strides of the ship’s captain. Captain Vendo whistled a complicated tune as he walked his rounds.
How easy was that? no mess, no stress no traveling :) Just a good old real time chicken curry. But I tell ya, this one would be worth all that trouble of running around the world :)

To be continued… maybe next week? I’m not sure, but I do need to come up with a more clear set of criteria to start eliminating these final eight movies, all of whom were the deserved winners in their respective Oscar races.
