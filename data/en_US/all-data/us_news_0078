Politics, unfortunately, got in the way. The Democratic leaders who took control of the House in 2007 vowed to block the trade agreements, and they succeeded. Only after the Republicans recaptured the House, and President Barack Obama negotiated a few changes to the agreements, did the in-basket get unclogged.
Several analysts expressed concern of GM's European operations. Despite restructuring efforts there, GM lost $700 million in Europe last year. That's an improvement from the $2.2 billion lost in 2010, but still a bigger loss than some financial observers had expected.

I have dozens of letters from readers incensed because Doonesbury did not run in our comics pages this week. This one captured the prevailing sentiment:
Severability: The ability for a part of the law to be separated from the rest of it without rendering other provisions unworkable. Arizona lawmakers added a severability clause to SB 1070 in hopes of protecting all of it from being deemed unconstitutional if part of it is struck down by the courts.
Many varieties of the flower peak in June, and by summer's end the foliage is turning brown. But the leaves are still feeding the roots, so don't chop the stalks until the end of October, said Ann McCulloh, curator of plant collections at Cleveland Botanical Garden.

Such is the argument of George C. Herring in "From Colony to Superpower," the latest volume in the distinguished Oxford History of the United States series. In exhaustive detail, he shows how a nation that believes itself uniquely virtuous, chosen by God to spread the blessings of liberty -- the City on a Hill, as the Pilgrims and Ronald Reagan would have it -- is in fact a fairly typical player on the world stage.
Gilbert Mayor John Lewis recalled how Shuhandler was assigned to "help train a rookie mayor" after he took office last spring and introduced him to the department.

Both plans sought to resolve a swirl of legal claims stemming from Tribune Co.'s $8.2 billion leveraged buyout in 2007, which preceded the bankruptcy by less than a year. Junior creditors led by Aurelius have argued that the buyout, led by Chicago billionaire Sam Zell, was a textbook case of fraudulent conveyance, meaning the debt-laden transaction left the company insolvent from the very start.

Steve Hagenbuckle, managing principal for TerraCap Partners in New York, expects that corporate earnings will likely exceed expectations again in the third quarter and help boost the market.
Interest earnings don't encourage more savings, and banks are charging more just to hold individuals' money. Today's rock-hard times are what make President Barack Obama's efforts to create jobs and get America back to work incredibly important.
“We need to make sure that every kid has someone that they can talk to.”
The issue then was finding one of the candidates who had facilitated a call using this service. If they could say, or if The Sun could discern through campaign finance records, who they had paid for their robodials, a reporter could identify callers and press them further.
Sallie Mae, based in Reston, Va., is the nation's largest student lender, formally known as SLM Corp.

"You're playing a great CBC ballclub -- I think I made a comment it's the best CBC team I've seen in my 33 years here being a St. Louis U. High -- and you can't give a great ballclub things, and we gave them things," SLUH coach Gary Kornfeld said. "Obviously they didn't need what we gave them, but we put ourselves behind the eight ball because of that."
Referee Dan O'Rourke immediately waved the goal off.
Asked why the library offers programs focusing on crime prevention, McFarland responds, "quite a few neighborhood associations meet at the library to discuss safety and other matters." She adds, "we are all about sharing information that people can use to better their lives," whether through programming, books, digital media or in other forms. McFarland continues, "every person should know and use simple safety measures whether they live in the city or in a more affluent, suburban area."

An investigation is ongoing.
But that would assume that the filmmakers put some thought into this script (itself adopted from a Korean comic). And any script that has head-scratching lines such as “With or without the clergy, we’re still priests!” hasn’t had any thought put into it at all.
Oil prices have jumped $20 since the Libyan uprising began in February. Higher oil prices can pinch spending by forcing consumers to pay more for gasoline and could cut into economic growth.
"It honestly is a dream come true," Tollefson said. "I was hopeful, but I also knew it was kind of a long shot. But it clicked today, and it just felt great."

The chief said he was consulting with his command staff to "formulate contingency plans to make sure this doesn't happen again."
"Rhyming Life & Death" does its initial impaling on an agreeably rickety scaffold. A fictional figure identified only as "The Author" -- we of course will recognize the voice of the real author -- submits to the dismal ritual of a literary talk.
A 2007 graduate of Wentzville Holt High School, Birza moved to Los Angeles two years ago. Although modeling has paid his bills (Mother Model Management in Dardenne Prairie discovered him at a high school career day and still represents him), his passion is music and how it can bring people around the world together. He plans, after paying taxes, to use his prize to build a home recording and video studio, and he'll probably take another year off to travel before beginning college.
Cranford resident Kevin Campbell criticized the sewer fee plan for not taking into account actual household water usage.
Value relationships. My mother has lifelong friendships and easily establishes new ones. Building, expanding and maintaining relationships is a crucial career skill. My mother never burns bridges.

The process involves attaching flat or intricately molded beams to the ceiling to create a square, grid-like pattern that is then typically trimmed out with crown molding, Bandon said. Building a soffit box around the perimeter of a ceiling also can give the look of a layered, coffer-like ceiling, said Ken Collier, editor in chief of the Family Handyman magazine.

No such doubt surrounds the intent of avowed al-Qaida emulators such as al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which has been tied to two of the most recent failed attacks on U.S. targets. In 2009, the group dispatched the so-called underwear bomber in a failed attempt to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day, and the following year it tried to send bombs through the mail to Chicago addresses. Last year, a CIA drone strike killed AQAP's most charismatic leader, the Yemeni-born cleric and naturalized U.S. citizenAnwar al-Awlaki. But the group's continued focus on attacking the American homeland makes it one of the most serious threats counter-terrorism officials must deal with.

Shortly after that, a tripping penalty against defenseman Nikita Nikitin put Calgary on the power play, and Jarome Iginla responded with a goal to trim the Blues' lead to 3-2 with 3:05 left in the second period. Goaltender Jaroslav Halak, who still appears to be battling the puck, allowed two goals on 17 shots Monday but had some decent saves.

They do need to lose him, though, so flash-forward a year and the film starts to pick up.
I'll offer one here: "Six O'Clock," from Ringo Starr's 1973 album, "Ringo." Starr sings the lead vocals, of course, but McCartney wrote it, plays keyboards on it and sings some of the backing vocals. It's got tidy little verses and one of those big, romantic McCartney choruses; it easily could have been a big hit, for Starr or someone else, but for some reason (maybe because there several other single-worthy songs on "Ringo," and three of them reached the Top 10), it wasn't. Check it out:
"A gutsy type of playoff win," Indiana head coach Frank Vogel said. "Holding them to 35 percent shooting is a very strong effort. They're a challenging team to guard."
As soon as the Mickey Loomis wiretap probe ends, the NFL is expected to launch an investigation into ESPN's Adam Schefter for planting bugs, which ESPN will reveal on its ticker even before NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell can get to a podium to announce it.

Ron Galatolo, chancellor of the San Mateo Community College District, has worked with and known Bunton for about 10 years. Galatolo has accepted free golf from Bunton and reported it on required state forms. He said Bunton is a decent and professional man and the emails were uncharacteristic.
I rarely sleep more than six hours. If I sleep longer, I feel logy. I fall asleep quickly, and I almost always wake up before my alarm. Are there any health worries from sleeping less than eight hours?
Maybe it was because Williams' words were superseded by a code whereby one player doesn't try to ruin another's career. In the era of free agency, players have friends throughout the league. The Saints' middle linebacker that day, Jonathan Vilma, is close with Gore, for example. Both played at the University of Miami, and they hang out together in the offseason.
Jeffrey Koplan, former head of the CDC and vice president for global health at Emory University in Atlanta, remembers smoking a pipe while writing up patient notes at a prestigious New York hospital in the 1970s. (He gave up the habit more than 30 years ago.)

His Royal Bobness, of course, turned 70 on May 24 and I found myself again temporarily immersed in Dylan songs, which I heard from an astounding variety of sources (more on that later), and all the online lists floating around about favorite songs and what one might offer the guy for his milestone birthday.
Genest said that he doesn't like Prop. 29's steep rise in cigarette taxes. But among the many things that Sacramento lawmakers may have to do to balance the books, he said, a higher tobacco tax "could fit in the mix."

I loved the classic, dark Viking Inn Supper Club in Viroqua with the loaded salad bar complete with herring and the buttery garlic bread at your table. Yes, this is a classic Wisconsin supper club (113 N. Main St., Viroqua; 1-608-637-7398).
Pipeline oversight now is fragmented, leaving the states as the best hope for coordination and gap-filling. Siting decisions happen at one agency, monitoring at another. Oil pipelines and natural gas pipelines report to different regulators. Environmental concerns rank low, a particular problem in the Great Lakes region, where even the smallest rivulets eventually flow into the big lakes.
Heading home after a tough day at work, Jeremy Haugh is beat — too tired, he knows, to run.
But it also used to be that we watched movies on VHS tapes, used carbon paper and paid less than two bucks a gallon for gas. Debates over sexuality and religion are now firmly embedded in our political process and are impossible to ignore. The discussions this election cycle have run the gamut from the superficial and farcical to genuine, impassioned debates on our deeply divided religious world views. Clearly, sex, religion, and politics are no longer off limits in our national conversation.
Rolling on: What else got done? Plenty. Pesky potholes disappeared while important signs reappeared. Out-of-synch traffic signals regained their timing. Water lines stopped leaking. Streetlights regained their glow.

Tax renewal, 1 mill, 5 years, roads
Granted, that will be an obvious, even shopworn, observation to anyone with the slightest experience in this all-American conundrum. But it assumes added urgency when you consider that this perceptual gap isn't measuring the impact of race on how we view this year's trial of the century, but, rather, an actual president of the United States and, by extension, the state of the Union.
One barefooted Carolina Avenue resident didn't hear anything but woke to flashing lights.
The Tribe's six left-handed hitting starters went 0-for-8 against Teaford.
There are a variety of surprises at Kurata, a neighborhood Japanese restaurant with a tiny dining room and an unexpectedly large menu. It offers the basic Japanese standards -- sometimes quite well -- a wide range of nigiri sushi, donburi sushi and sushi rolls, and some dishes you hardly see at all.
A lot of water and blood under the bridge - by 2009, Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and invited Mustaine to participate in the ceremony. He declined, citing European touring commitments.

My heaven? On this afternoon, it was climbing the narrow stairway to the Mill Top Tavern (miltoptavern.com) on St. George Street in the historic district to catch singer-songwriter Don Oja-Dunaway. I met him here a dozen years ago when I was reporting a story on folk icon Gamble Rogers. Oja-Dunaway, 66, knew Rogers and other folk heroes such as Steve Goodman.
I would put the savings for now into a safe parking place like an online savings account, credit union CD, U.S. Treasury bills and the like. You could invest some of it into low-cost mutual funds on a regular basis, too.

Although many in the city — including us — wouldn’t consider that a heartbreak, we are concerned that this decision to flout the original 2004 state gaming law that mandated two casinos in the city has no basis other than purely political.
øSaving the money somewhere outside of an IRA is also a good alternative. Anything from a savings account or money market (if you'll need it pretty soon after retirement) to a quality stock mutual fund (if you can let it grow for several years) are just a couple of good choices.

Frank Wagner, an organizer of the Garfield Heights campaign, said he's glad the city will return some money "but they're giving back $100,000 they never should have taken." Wagner called the photo enforcement program a cash grab and violation of civil liberties that does little to improve safety.

The rock musical - which Bell staged in steampunk fashion - was miles away, tonally and stylistic, from "The Glass Menagerie," Williams' autobiographical "memory play." The production at Dramatic License co-starred Kim Furlow as Tom's imposing mother, Amanda Wingfield.
The ho-hum reaction in Maryland is being driven by several factors: lack of a competitive race at the top of the Democratic ticket; a primary date that falls in the middle of spring break for many schools; and the inability of most of the GOP presidential candidates to organize in one of the bluest states in the nation.

Of course, the city just last week signed a consent agreement with the state that foresees a more comprehensive restructuring of city government and plan for growth -- the only thing that will put Detroit's financial problems behind it. It's unreasonable to expect that Bing's budget would deliver on that promise in one fell swoop.

The Nobel laureate has lived in this converted boathouse since the late 1970s, when she spotted a "For Sale" sign while driving by and soon agreed to pay the then-impractical sum of $120,000. Her commitment was tested, then confirmed, after the house burned down in 1993, destroying everything from private letters to her sons' report cards. But she had the house rebuilt and upgraded and so enjoys a setting both spacious and personal, with bookcases and paintings, plants and carvings, a patio and private dock.

And let me add something else that I fought for and got in place, and that is in addition to the stick of not being able the graduate if you can't pass the graduation exam -- by the way you get five chances to pass it. Starting in your sophomore year, then two in your junior year, and two in your senior year. And then if you can't pass it, we'll let you go to community college and keep trying. We give you plenty of chances.

Some proponents insist that session beers must be less than 4 percent alcohol. That can be hard to find in this country of big beers, but not impossible. Cain's Dark Mild clocks in at a mere 3.2 percent. But don't confuse it with the 3.2 beer you buy at the grocery store. This Liverpudlian mild ale is packed with flavor. A light touch of roasted malt brings chocolate notes that complement the toffee and toast center. Mild bitterness and moderate carbonation keep it smooth. It's one of my new favorites.

The key for all athletes is to be worth the trouble. The more they are worth, the more trouble they can cause.

You can avoid the tournament snack stands, with their high-priced sodas and sugary treats, and save a pretty penny by packing your own water, energy bars and lunches for your player and your family spectators.

"Pretty in Pink" (1986): There was a time when Jon Cryer wasn't known as Charlie Sheen's long-suffering co-star. Back in the day he was known as Ducky, who has had a thing for Andie Walsh (Molly Ringwald). Enter rich, snobby Blane (Andrew McCarthy). Howard Deutch directed John Hughes' script, which is typically knowing of adolescent feelings. But the best part is Harry Dean Stanton's heatbreaking turn as Andie's down-on-his-luck dad.

Every bottle of champagne is a blend of many wines, but it owes its signature sparkle entirely to pent-up carbon dioxide. In fact, an average bottle of champagne contains about five or six times its volume in carbon dioxide, so compressed that when the champagne cork pops, it typically kicks out of the bottle's neck at about 30 miles per hour, Dr. Liger-Belair says. The champagne will actually taste better, he says, if the cork can be released with a more subdued CO2 sigh.

In Frank's Salon, Mr. Cimo queried his readers:"When the name calling gets ugly, who does the President call?" While three responders tippy-toed around the issue, not one could give a logical, common sense answer.

6. Tony Lucca -- This is the kind of manufactured drama reality show writers dredge up hoping it will lead to some uncomfortable moments. A former Mouseketeer who once performed with Christina on the same show went unrecognized by her even as she and the other three mentors recognized his vocal talent.

A: I look at it this way: People have given you money to sit in the dark and given you control over everything they're going to see and hear for two-plus hours. Either you can use that time to put them in that head space, or you can squander it. It seems like there was an opportunity here to bring Lisbeth's subconscious to the fore -- as well as, in another context, making a little homage to James Bond title sequences.

Mr. Gingrich can now consider himself a front-runner, but the local fishmonger's inventory has a longer shelf life. On the defensive in the week leading up to South Carolina, Mitt Romney has upped his attacks on the former House speaker in recent days — on matters ranging from his work as a consultant to his general goofiness — and they are likely to have an impact before Florida votes on Jan. 31.

The strangest had to be in April 1998, when two suicidal women walked onto the bridge at the same time, with the same intention. Apparently, one said something to the other, and they realized they were both there to end their lives. The women sat on the edge of the span, on the other side of the railing, chatting. A Golden Gate Bridge patrol officer saw them and said something to the effect of, "You two ought to come off there. It's not safe." He never thought they were there to jump.

When couture exhibitions at fine arts museums draw bigger crowds than old masters, and glossy magazines continue to multiply, it's hard to dispute the popularity of fashion.

Move the can labeled "Plan 9 from Outer Space" along the vault shelf to make room for a Web series that is so incomprehensible and heavy-footed it bumps comfortably against the Ed Wood Jr. so-bad-it's-good classic. This six-chapter spin-off of the popular video game franchise by Bioware is set in one weird sword-and-sorcery world (but strangely, no dragons appear). It runs less than 90 minutes, as most "chapters" are no more than eight minutes. (But "six chapters" sure sounds good when you're buying.) Not only does Felicia Day (of "The Quick" fame) star, but she also wrote the blubbery dialogue and wears ridiculously angled elfish ears to portray Tallis, a warrioress who joins with a "templar" knight (Adam Rayner) to traipse clumsily through the Van Nuys foothills in search of an escaped "mase" - whatever that is - with a glassy-eyed demon (Doug Jones) waiting to send her and her weirdo pals into another dimension. The action and stunts are so poorly staged that the editor can't save them by fast cutting. The incompetence is entertaining at times. The bonus features are plentiful, with spools of "making of" footage and actors talking into the camera, plus prolonged (perhaps slumber-indzucing) commentary from Day and director Peter Winther.

Another factor that could raise prices is that East Coast refineries have been sold or closed down, like the ConocoPhillips refinery in Trainer, Pa., and Sunoco facilities in Philadelphia and Marcus Hook, Pa.

At 5-foot-7, though, Jones-Drew is no scatback. Powerfully built, carrying about 210 pounds, the former UCLA star can be a high-volume pounder, as evidenced by his output in Jaguar wins over Indianapolis (26 carries, 105 yards), Dallas (27, 135) and last Sunday over Houston (24, 100). Rashad Jennings and Deji Karim, late picks from the last two drafts, get enough carries to keep Jones fresh. They have been more effective behind Jones-Drew than Cleveland’s Mike Bell has been behind Hillis. The Browns allowed a combined 126 rushing yards to New Orleans and New England. Against New York, with captain Scott Fujita going down early, the Jets ran for 172 yards. It took 45 carries to do it, the most against the Browns this year, but the net effect kept Cleveland off balance. Being a run-first team, the Jaguars surely take this as an invitation.
At age 9, Jazz learned how to use quicklime to dissolve body parts. At 11, he was taught how to duplicate keys. It's unclear at what age he witnessed alternative uses for Drano, but all of this unseemly knowledge comes in handy when Jazz suspects the woman found in the field was the victim of a serial killer. When he shares his suspicion with the sheriff, however, he's brushed off — until yet another dead body shows up in the otherwise sleepy town of Lobo's Nod.

The victory in the U.S. territory was so convincing that Romney, the GOP front-runner, won all 20 delegates to the national convention at stake because he prevailed with more than 50 percent of the vote.

That's a good chunk of money, for sure. The figure, however, is a bit misleading. It includes escalators that were installed when the stadium was built.

From experience, Weyandt said she's learned to keep the tanks covered while she uses fiberglass mounted fish to teach children.

(You do have a serving piece modeled on the infamous volcanic island in your butler’s pantry, don’t you? Right next to your commemorative Chernobyl compote dish?) Then pour 1 bottle of strawberry syrup over the model to simulate lava, followed by ¼ bottle of brandy. Set it aflame. Enjoy.

A: Because homecourt was such a longshot that it would have meant playing every player the balance of the season. Remember, the Heat can still finish No. 1 in the East by winning their final two and Chicago losing their last two.

Health care providers agree that there have been outrageous cases of neglect that warrant felony charges, said Matt Anderson, a vice president for regulatory/strategic affairs at the Minnesota Hospital Association.
