Actually, some of the new film’s most enjoyable moments occur even before the stylish, Bond-like opening credits as English recovers his pride in an obviously disciplined Himalayan monastery. Naturally, in a desperate attempt to toughen up the humiliated spy — and apparently to target the film’s PG demographic of 10-year-olds — the allegedly devout monks deem it necessary to strengthen Johnny’s groin area almost as much as his mind. (Before collective eyes start rolling, know that the early sight gags are easily more humorous than the obvious payoff way down the line.)

Even before I saw what was on the plate, I thought that probably broke a record for the most expensive fried chicken main course in the city. I was even more shocked when the dish was presented. It was a heaping pile of greens with a too-acidic dressing, topped with a boneless breast with the drumstick portion of the wing attached. It tasted fine, but seemed more like a light luncheon dish.

Indeed, Santorum appears to have voted for every "emergency supplemental" spending bill sought by the Bush administration, adding tens of billions to the deficit. He also opposed repeated efforts to reimpose the "pay-go" rules that were designed to hold down spending increases and tax giveaways.

Smog-eating roof tile: Featured at Disney World's new Vision House exhibit, this concrete tile roof looks like any other. But Boral Roofing says an average 2,000-square-foot roof can scrub the air of 10,800 miles of smog per average 2,000 square foot roof every year. Titanium dioxide (an ingredient of toothpaste) embedded in the tiles converts nitrogen oxide in pollution into nitrates, which wash off the roof during rain and green up the lawn. But the tiles cost about a quarter more than traditional tiles and can't neutralize carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.

Lance Berkman and Carlos Beltran are going to need days off from time to time and that fill-in duty will almost certainly go to Craig. I imagine there will be a number of days where Beltran spells Jon Jay in center as well, opening up right for Craig.

I'll break down the particulars below, but it's likely the Lakers will let down their guard tonight in Game 2. The reasons go beyond the inevitable adjustments from a playoff series. The Lakers have followed many signature wins, including ones against the Clippers, Celtics, Heat and Spurs, with clunkers. The Lakers may say the mind-set changes when the playoffs hit. But it's possible they believe Denver has no chance of beating them. Hence, the possible letdown.

A. What the movies have been able to do now is finally get the effects right. You picture Spider-Man on-screen, jumping from building to building — that couldn’t have been done 20 years ago. … But I think the appeal was always there. When you’re a little kid, you love fairy tales; stories of giants and ogres and witches and elves. Then you get a little older, you’re not going to read fairy tales anymore. But superhero stories are like fairy tales for grown-ups. They let you recapture that same feeling you had the first time you read “Jack, the Giant Killer.” What we tried to do at Marvel was write the stories correctly, too, and put in enough of the personal lives of the characters so it wasn’t just one fight scene after another.

We think that this is what health care reform is intended to accomplish.

Room 77 (www.room77.com) has added a price search function to its unique (as far as I know) individual room locator capability. Since its inception, Room 77 has featured hotel floor maps showing the location of individual rooms, and its "room concierge" function lets you identify and request a room in a location you prefer -- high floor, view, quiet, whatever you want. The new price comparison function is extremely fast; it searches among the big online agencies that usually have the best available rates and it usually matches the lowest price it finds on other sites. One thing that stands out when you use Room 77 is how often the big online agency prices are identical or within a dollar of each other. Except for the "opaque" sites, it is becoming increasingly obvious that no individual site can really beat its competitors by a significant amount.

"Internal Time" is a cautionary tale—actually a series of 24 tales, not coincidentally. Mr. Roenneberg ranges widely from the inner workings of biological rhythms to their social implications, illuminating each scientific tutorial with an anecdote inspired by clinical research. We learn about people's temporal propensities, or chronotypes; the optical receptors that admit light to reset our clocks (the rear of the knee was once thought to be a receptor, too); and about the ill consequences of daylight-saving time, which forces our bodies to adjust, overnight, to a new regimen. The virtues of early rising, Mr. Roenneberg suggests, are highly overrated, particularly for "night owls" (late chronotypes). Suicides, surprisingly, occur more frequently not in the grim depths of winter darkness but during the sunlit days of midsummer, when the energy of desperate individuals is greatest (in winter, depression can be truly disabling).

The department's watchdog found serious flaws in the sheriff's internal investigation. Investigators, including a deputy who had previously worked in the same unit with Shapiro, inadvertently tipped off the detective before executing their search warrant and allowed him to be present for an interview with a key witness, according to a 2010 report by the Office of Independent Review.

Reasons for optimism: The Ducks return just two full-time starters, Asper at right tackle and York at left guard. But Weems, a right tackle, is a quasi returning starter given that he has 27 career games under his belt, including 11 last year with seven stars. All told, the Ducks projected starters, including Golpashin, have a combined 104 games of experience. Challenging Golpashin at right guard will be Cody, a versatile reserve who has appeared in 20 games. That level of experience at guard and tackle will come in handy with a virtual rookie expected to start at center. Armstrong, a sophomore, is the leading candidate to start there but redshirt freshman Hroniss Grasu also is in the mix. A wildcard that could play in a big way for Oregon is the return of center Hamani Stevens. He left the team for a two-year Mormon mission to the Philippines but is back and has participated in summer workouts. If he can shake off the rust of being absent for two seasons, Hamani could end up being the starter at center. Rivals.com ranked Hamani as the No. 2 center prospect in the country in 2008.

Lemming Mafia (Mayfair, $35; 3-6 players; age 8+; 20 min.) Even if the game itself weren't a modest delight, you'd have to give kudos to whoever thought up the idea of these underworld rodents. Six of them, decked out in lurid fedoras and neckties, are in a race to plunge off a pier, and the players try to influence the outcome by filling their shoes with concrete or jackhammering it off again. The game is quick, simple and perfectly wonderful.

An educational therapist is a person who works professionally with the learning difference population. An educational therapist is trained to assess, address and remediate an individual's learning differences. After doing an assessment, an educational therapist will create an individualized treatment program from a variety of sources, including the client's social, emotional, psychoeducational and neuropsychological context, in order to correct underlying learning issues. Rather than be a classroom teacher, educational therapists focus exclusively on a child or adult who needs one-on-one attention in private practice, independent (private) schools and clinical or hospital settings.

Ed Sage of Portland writes: I feel as though it's a myth that you should keep a mortgage around so that you can itemize the interest.

In the meantime, we'd SAVE thousands and thousands of dollars not paying interest! Isn't this correct?

Let's also be straightforward about who is backing this measure, and then let's speculate as to why. The good-government types — the League of Women Voters and Common Cause, among others — are on board, and that stands to reason. But so are organized labor and the chambers of commerce. They are exactly the interests, on the left and the right, respectively, that profit from the current system. They clearly see their prospects improving under Proposition 28.

Such caution comes as the average number of people seeking U.S. unemployment benefits over the past month has risen to a three-month high. According to the April jobs report, employers added 120,000 jobs last month — half the December-February pace and well short of the 210,000 economists were expecting.

The Big East has been talking expansion all the way to San Diego State this week, and why not? With this cast of games and characters, maybe it should cede its BCS bid. Consider: Louisville (6-5) is at South Florida (5-5) and can pretty much wrap up the league's bid with a win today. Then there's Pitt (5-5) at West Virginia (7-3), but both of those schools are planning to leave the league, Pitt to the ACC and West Virginia to the Big 12 and only a series of upsets could get West Virginia in the BCS picture this year. And don't forget Rutgers (8-3) at UConn (4-6), last year's Big East champ.

The atmosphere Saturday was impossible to describe with words. Words do not adequately replicate the experience of absorbing the noise that topped 120 decibels at five or six points in this thrilling contest. This is like having your nose pressed against the hull of a 757 aircraft with the jet engines going full-bore for two hours. My ears still are ringing, and I want more. I want a lot more.

And that's the point I want to stress: My favorite memories of Monterey golf weren't forged at Pebble Beach. They happened during a weekend I spent at Del Monte Golf Course about 10 years ago.

It was a flat-out beautiful course that didn't break the bank. And I felt like I was walking on hallowed golfing ground.
