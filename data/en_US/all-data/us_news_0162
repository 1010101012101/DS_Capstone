According to neurologists, however, that brief, cataclysmic moment, was only the beginning of his injury. In spinal-cord cases such as his, a cascade of physiological crises is unleashed by the initial blow.

The Ameren Electric utility, much smaller in size than the ExxonMobil giant, gets rumors too: of impending summer storms, severe winter storms, flooding, year around wind and tree damage. We have seen the predictions of these disasters to occur time after time this past year. As costs mount for these natural problems, the utility looks to raise the price of their services, but any and all rate increases have to be reviewed first by an public utility commision. It seems the rate increases are always challenged, finally (maybe) awarded, but modified, after many months of hasseling and arbitration. Remember that the billing by the electric company comes after usage (payment by many customers is delayed, or not paid at all, and has to be worked out ); with the gasoline companies, you pay up front, cash or credit, before you get the product

About the Suns: Phoenix is on a season-best three-game winning streak, which has coincided with 7-footer Earl Barron being inserted into the starting lineup in place of Hedo Turkoglu. With Barron in the lineup, the Suns have outrebounded two of their last three opponents after outrebounding only one of their first 17 opponents ... Nash and Richardson both come in on hot streaks.

I told him: Captain America is the leader of The Avengers, but say he had a chance to join the X-Men, and they were offering him a better chance to beat Red Skull, a shiny new shield, and a super-charged PlayStation 3, would you blame him if he left The Avengers? Spider-Man is the coolest Marvel hero ever, but what if DC offered him a chance to fly like Superman and make more money at The Daily Planet than he ever could at The Daily Bugle? The little guy did his best to understand. This was speaking his language.

Some guests visit other towns or ruins, or plan snorkeling excursions to a nearby shipwreck.
When it comes to his style, Rouse said, "I'm open to anything. Basically, it's just the needs of each individual piece. Works that jump willy-nilly from one style to another leave me dizzy. I prefer to integrate (the music), so that it all seems to fit together somehow, not like a bunch of found objects all thrown together."
"We don't expect it to have a significant impact next year on our earnings," Fields said outside an industry conference near Detroit. "Our intent is to make sure we follow the regulations and our pensions are funded according to the law."
By the 1970s, Joan Didion and others were attacking the women's movement, accusing feminists of "narcissism, ignorance, and sloth." By the 1980s, Showalter writes, "women fully joined the literary juries of the United States. . . . No longer dependent on judgments that denied them representation." By the 1990s, Showalter writes, women dominated the book market, buying between 70% and 90% of all fiction, and she notes a rise in women's gothic -- works by Mary Karr, Kathryn Harrison, Dorothy Allison, Susanna Moore and Alice Sebold that did not shy from violence. She also notes an ethnic cross-fertilization, with second-generation immigrants including Gish Jen and Julia Alvarez.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the village of Roxana and the school districts in Roxana, Wood River and East Alton.

As former Homeland Secretary Tom Ridge underlined at an international seminar on Iran in Paris on Dec. 22, time is not an ally when it comes to preventing the tyrannical regime in Iran from becoming a nuclear power.

Most of the tours in Napa inevitably focus on red wine - it is Cabernet country, after all - but white wine lovers will warm to a visit up Spring Mountain to Stony Hill. The McCrea family has been making Chardonnay since 1952 - when it was just an obscure white variety with little expected future here - along with age-worthy Gewurztraminer and Riesling.

Zakiya throws shot put and discus on the Beckman track team. She was seriously fierce before, in that dress, with that smile, she is awesome.
That's especially true of "Blue Nights," which, by its nature, cannot help but remain unresolved. Like "The Year of Magical Thinking," it's an example of the book as coping mechanism, of an author using language to "maintain movement," as Didion puts it, "otherwise you couldn't function. It's a necessary mask." Like "The Year of Magical Thinking," it is written almost entirely in fragments, as if it would otherwise be impossible to make all these impressions coalesce. "Memories are what you no longer want to remember," Didion writes about a third of the way through the book, and it's one of those lines that resonates because it hints at both the futility and the inescapability of the task. "A big part of the book is how to function. It's a lesson on how to function," she says flatly. "Because otherwise you would not be able to get through the day, the week."

Put up awnings or a patio cover, plant trees in front of windows, add a shade screen or cover windows with clear film.
The salmon ($15.95) was so-so, mostly because the piece of fish didn't have enough flavor and was a bit overcooked. This dish simply needs better salmon. I did enjoy the goat cheese and small pieces of lobster claw meat on the plate. Again, get better asparagus or switch to a fresh, seasonal vegetable. Ours was big but bland, and a little tough.
"When I was growing up, I loved hearing the smooth jazz artists in the '90s, and it just seemed to get a little more watered down and watered down as time went on," said McKelley, a 1998 Canton McKinley High School graduate. "Now it's not as popular as it used to be, so what I'm trying to do is assimilate myself as more of a contemporary jazz artist or just an instrumental R&B artist. Kind of like what Santana does, just inject myself into the mainstream as much as I can with my instrument. I just signed a distribution deal with Little Fish Records, and in the next year I'd like to do another studio CD, a Christmas release and also a fusion project. This album is the vehicle to jumpstart these other projects and create momentum."

Unlike House candidates, Senate candidates do not file electronically with the FEC. Instead, they provide a printed accounting of campaign contributions and disbursements to the Senate public records office, a process that can keep the records from being available to the public for a day or more.

Simple, elegant and easy to understand, much like the company's products. As a reporter, I wish the company had addressed the DOJ's hub-and-spoke theory, which held that the publishers initiated the idea of raising e-book prices through an agency sales model, then put the alleged conspiracy into effect with Apple's help. But it looks like the company will be no more voluble about controversial matters under the leadership of Tim Cook than it was under the late Steve Jobs.

The danger of this continued involvement in the country we invaded on false pretenses almost nine years ago cannot be ignored. With aspirations for freedom and democracy spreading throughout the region, a perceived U.S. client-state will act as a thorn in the region's side. How can Iraqis believe in their system of government while they watch the continued construction of permanent U.S. facilities in Iraq?
But Congress, facing regional competition for money and struggling to hold down domestic spending during wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has never approved as much. The last Great Lakes Legacy bill approved only $54 million a year, and actual spending was often lower.

The government in March rejected Chrysler's restructuring plan and gave it 30 days to make another effort, including a tie-up with Fiat. The company, which has borrowed $4 billion from the federal government and needs billions more, faces deadline tonight to cut labor costs, slash debt and take on a partner if it wants more aid. President Barack Obama said Wednesday night while the lender talks were still ongoing that he was "very hopeful" that deals can be worked out to keep Chrysler LLC a viable automaker, and more hopeful than he was a month ago that the company will stay in business.

As we listened, it became clear why the college had chosen to bestow the honor on Judge Capers, who graduated in 1945 from the Cleveland Law School, Cleveland-Marshall's predecessor.

The most unsettling thing in the movie may be that the "military-industrial complex" has seemingly become an accepted phenomenon. No one here is denying that there exists a multifarious relationship between corporations and investment firms such as Halliburton and the Carlyle Group with the U.S. military and Congress. Perle downplays any hint of scandal in the affiliations, and Lewis points out that it's all legal.

Brooklyn: My heart goes out to the Gonzalez family. But the car was speeding at 70 mph. The three major causes of horrific accidents are speeding, drunken driving and using cell phones or texting while driving. These are the issues that must be addressed, not how wide a parkway should be. May the victims rest in peace, and may we all learn to just slow down! Jacqueline Loconsolo-Gates

Recent data show the economy has strengthened this fall and hiring has picked up.
Like many states, California is struggling to pay for the health insurance it offers poor residents. The ranks of the Medi-Cal program grew by more than 12% after the economy tanked, and rising healthcare costs increased the fiscal burden. Making matters worse, state officials kept trying to solve the problem mainly by paying doctors less for their services and charging Medi-Cal beneficiaries more, ignoring the skewed incentives and inefficiencies in the system that were driving costs higher.
Sacks said Healey's only hesitation involved her boss, John Buck, who less than two years earlier had hired her as a principal at his commercial real estate development firm.

These worst-places-to-do-business "Bottom 10" states had roughly 17 million more adults not living in poverty – yes, above the poverty line – compared to the CEO's 10 favorite states. That's a 22 percent advantage. So, when you then track the combined poverty rate in the professed anti-business Bottom 10 states, you see a well-below-national average rate of 14.4 percent of the citizenry in this measure of financial distress.
The signature drive to qualify the measure was funded in part by liberal billionaire George Soros ($1 million) and investment banker David Mills ($500,000).
There was a time that shows like MTV's "Celebrity Deathmatch" (a clay-mation parody featuring ridiculous line-ups of celebrities slugging it out in the ring) were funny because they were so outlandishly over the top and improbable. Now, stuff like that is just called the Tuesday line-up. In order to remain relevant, reality stars need to continue to shock and awe us. Please. So we can keep from switching over to the 24-hour news channels and seeing the latest unemployment statistics.

A one-minute scene. And it ended on a solid laugh.
Next Tuesday, Republican voters will award the biggest delegate haul so far this year — more than 400 in all. Super Tuesday, however, is considerably less super than past versions, as fewer states hold contests on that day and new party rules spread the delegates more proportionately among the GOP contenders. As a result, the eight primaries and three caucuses are unlikely to generate a decisive overall victory for anyone.

This garish palatial wreck, with its swimming pool, putting green and rat-infested rooms, is no more surreal than the work of its current occupants, whose ironic term for what they do is "minor combat." But "Gunner Palace," which was directed by Michael Tucker and Petra Epperlein, eschews easy ironies of its own. Neither antiwar nor pro-, it's a portrait of American soldiers as they're rarely if ever seen on mainstream TV -- angry, confused, cynical, flamingly foul-mouthed, constantly scared and yet, in the midst of Baghdad's lethal chaos, improbably good-natured and steadfastly brave. (A coda lists the names of five soldiers and three Iraqi nationals, all connected to the unit, who died during the year the film was in production.)

If anything, the Buffett Rule doesn't go nearly far enough. We should restore tax rates to what they were before 1981, and make the capital-gains rate the same as the rate on ordinary income.

So my question: I've long wondered, no, agonized, what does it take to start a revolution? How is it that a misguided mob of miscreants is imbued with revolutionary zeal while we, the bereft, bemoan, blame and, sheep-like, simply bleat? This has been a grotesquely uncivil war, and the only committed soldiers are the bad guys! I'm not advocating the return of the guillotine, but " heads" do need to be removed. There is no party that represents me or anyone in my situation. What I am advocating is a we-the-people party. Anyone for a revolution? A civil one, of course.

Go on a picnic. Most of the USA couldn't pull this one off in mid-February, but in the Valley it's a definite possibility.

Next spring, after "Living in a Modern Way" closes, the contents of the Eames living room, now certifiably insect-free, will be delivered back to the house in the Palisades.

If you crave authentic Chinese comfort food, go for the Zha Ziang Mian, listed on the English menu as Chinese spaghetti ($6.75). This robust combination of ground pork and fermented black beans garnished with cucumber strips and served over Chinese noodles certainly isn't my mom's spaghetti, but it's interesting, a bit exotic - and a credit to "cheap Chinese" everywhere.

(On building a foundation in the draft and how much he has held back on free agency and trades so far and when they will delve more heavily into that)- "At the end of the season that kind of develops its own life. This year as I mentioned we're focused in on handling our own guys, key guys, Joe Thomas and guys like that. I know that's the way we're going to do it. What you've said, you build a foundation and I think stability for your franchise through the draft. I believe in that. After every offseason how you dive into free agency is determined, one, by whose available and, two, your needs, your immediate needs. Of course there's a money element to that as well. There have not been any constrictions about money, so then it's just decision making. It's been my experience and I think probably Tom's as well, is that I think maybe we signed maybe the greatest free agent of all-time in Reggie White, the greatest free agent of all-time in Reggie White in Green Bay. At the time we paid him more money than anyone thought you should pay anybody. Now, looking back on it, it seems like beer money. You've also seen and you've also reported on and you've also read about free agents that just go, 'My goodness,' it didn't work. You're really rolling the dice a little bit. The grass always looks greener. That player always looks better than the player you have. You've got to be real careful with that. I think our philosophy will be, build through the draft, evaluate our needs and if there's a man available we'll go after him. We'll be as competitive in free agency as anybody. Are we just going to go off the charts every offseason doing that? No, I suspect that it will be different each year based on our needs."
“No, it’s not disappointing to us," Cooper said. "It’s disappointing to him because this was something that he’s always wanted to do.

Wayne famously played the part in a broad, showboaty fashion, pausing proudly after every one-liner.

The festival's hiring of former Cannes programmer Frederic Boyer was of particular interest to Mr. Lorber, whose company often champions foreign-language directors.

The time to be serious about chili and cranberries, cookies and pie has arrived. This likable search for holiday recipes requires no suitcase, just a taste for new and old ideas.

Obviously I'm being sarcastic. Spring football may be over, but what on earth are we going to talk about the next few months until fall camp opens? Of course we'll have some discussion about baseball and softball and maybe some basketball and hey, how about that women's golf team, but mostly, fans are going to be anticipating Aug. 6, so we'll have to discuss everything in detail until then.

I'm a 54-year-old guy in good shape (run 10K's; lift weights).

But according to Andreu Mas-Colell, Catalonia's economy minister, the real story is a little different. He explains that with the exception of the Basque Country, Spain's 17 regions enjoy spending autonomy but almost no revenue autonomy.

"No one wants to receive Tuesday's issue, containing news of Monday's events, on Wednesday," said Paul Boyle, a senior vice president of the Newspaper Association of America, which represents nearly 2,000 newspapers in the U.S. and Canada.

No matter what he tells reporters, Kerry wants his political legacy to start with something other than “failed presidential candidate.” The ghosts of the 2004 presidential election still haunt him — as does the fact that his desire to try again in 2008 was eclipsed by Obama’s national momentum.

Tulo a bargain? When the Rockies gave Troy Tulowitzki a seven-year, $134.5 million extension before last season, Jimenez wasn't the only one who reacted negatively. The deal was almost universally panned by national baseball writers for its length and the clear lack of urgency to give the shortstop a new deal. Sixteen months later, Tulo's contract looks like a bargain. His contract takes him through the age of 36, when he might be a third baseman but still has a decent shot of being productive.

The metro area lies 150 miles from the New Madrid Seismic Zone's epicenter, but that's small comfort - especially in areas close to the Mississippi River. That includes much of the city of St. Louis.
