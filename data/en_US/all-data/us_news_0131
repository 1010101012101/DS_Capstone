I’m not ashamed to admit it: I looked at his lack of moves last summer, saw the reloaded Eagles and the mounting injuries, and figured the Giants would go 6-10. This was hardly a position I held alone.

Yet the ballet also moves with the unhurried gait of a Russian novel, breaking up its little scenes of dancerly showmanship with an occasional burst of drama to remind you there's a story going on.

But observers say it is hard to predict whether the momentum from earlier talks can be maintained in light of Chen's escape from house arrest last week. The activist lawyer is believed to be receiving shelter and protection from U.S. diplomats in the Chinese capital, highlighting U.S. concern about China's human rights record -- concern that often puts China on the defensive. Frisbie cited worries that the sensitive diplomatic issue could preoccupy officials on both sides.

Straight out of Tampa, with beats provided by some Brits, Yo Majesty has gotten a lot of press in the past year. Not only has its risque anthem "Club Action" gotten a lot of play, but band members also have a reputation for removing articles of clothing during shows. The duo, Shunda K. and Jwl B., are out lesbians, in case their raunchy lyrics and titles such as "Kryptonite Pussy" didn't tip you off. But Yo Majesty's aim isn't to even the score with sexist male rappers with their own shocking content; it's to be real. "It's like a graveyard out there in hip-hop," Shunda told New Music Express. "There ain't nobody promoting realness. Now, for rappers, it's about abusing s- for materialistic reasons." www.yomajesty. com.

I cling to the remnants of Obamacare in the hope that some good may spring from them. I've read that it takes 20 years for Congress to wrap itself around a good idea, yet this is my 50th year of hope where comprehensive health care is concerned. Congress may yet fumble and stumble its way to a mandatory and national health insurance scheme like any other correct thinking nation, so there is hope, perhaps for my great-grand children.

Outpourings come with perfect "aw"-factor timing, and grand-gesture confessions are met with self-congratulatory clapping, smiles and monetary riches. One of the more egregiously dramatized emotional breakthroughs occurs when one of Burke's seminar attendees, a downtrodden contractor (John Carroll Lynch) paralyzed by the death of his son, finds the strength to go on when he shops freely at Home Depot, his fellow workshoppers in tow. The only thing missing from this crassly commercialized sequence is a jingle and a fade-out leading into "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition."

The reasoning: An 18-year-old woman with a so-called cleavage shot for her profile gets about 14 new contacts per month on average — 24% higher than the typical non-cleavage-baring 18-year-old. At age 32, she gets about 13 new contacts — but now that's a whopping 79% higher than high-collared women of the same age. Bottom line: A strategically placed neckline can slow the decline of slavish male attention. "The older the woman, the more relatively successful she is showing off her body," the bloggers write. Still, they add, the kinds of responses you're likely to get may not lead you anywhere.
After years of service to the American Cancer Society as a board member after the death of her husband, Joseph Silber, who was a national board member of the American Cancer Society, Jeannette Silber visited "Hope Lodge" in Baltimore in the 1990s and became determined to bring one to Cleveland.

The dish showed off Keefer's technical expertise and his skill with Mediterranean-influenced flavors. Over the phone, he explained that he's part Sicilian, and though he has experience with fare including French and Latin, at 1542, he's gravitating toward his rustic Italian roots. He's trying to stay simple in his food, he said, while creating something new, modern and flavorful. The octopus pizza fits that bill.

At dessert, the pear butterscotch bread pudding ($11) was improperly heated; it was warm on the outside, but still cold in the middle.
Alcohol has long been exorbitantly priced in Iceland, so the economic downturn makes drinking only slightly more affordable: about $5 for a Guinness at a hip club. Still, the night life in Reykjavik is legendary, and for a reason: The dancing, drinking, laughing and flirting last all night, with the dance floors getting so crowded that the only way to move is to shove. (Don't worry about being rude; everyone does it.) Add Iceland's inventive DJs, candy-flavored vodkas and friendly locals, and it's no wonder winter visitors welcome a midday sunrise on Saturday and Sunday.

At 151st and U.S. 69, Shields said, it would be better to cross on the south side of 151st because ramps on the north side carry six times as much traffic as those on the south side during the afternoon peak period.

Bullard's ideas are likely to carry considerable weight, and he's building on work by Michael Woodford, an influential Columbia University economist.

So Mobley "improperly influenced" the information that Carib News staffers Karl Rodney and Patricia Louis gave to other Ethics Committee staffers who would later approve the trip, the report said.

Every school year seems to bring bigger classes and fewer opportunities for students. Each spring is an endless churn of uncertainty and frantic fundraising. Next year's $429 million budget in Portland Public Schools is smaller than this year's $437 million budget, while health costs, PERS and other expenses rise, and other city districts are similarly squeezed. The thought of outside money preventing layoffs in Portland, or restoring lost school days in Parkrose, is welcome indeed.

If Warren wins the Senate race, it’d be a no-brainer. But frankly, the same should be true if she loses. Yes, it will leave a bad taste in Kerry’s month to allow Scott Brown to rise higher.

The concern about the future of Baltimore's central business district is valid, but the angst over the Constellation/Exelon decision is overblown.

Rather than moping, downtown boosters should think about the issue from Constellation's perspective and consider what would need to be done to make the next company's decision come out differently.

The Bears announced Friday that they've signed coach Lovie Smith to a two-year extension that keeps him under contract through 2013. Smith's staff will return virtually intact, which gives the Bears a big advantage over teams with new head coaches and/or coordinators in an offseason that likely will be frozen by a labor stoppage.

But we've survived being called plenty of things. In the 1970s it was "Birthplace of the John Birch Society." (For the record, that technically was my sister-in-law's home, Indianapolis.) And if it weren't for being upstaged by "The Real Housewives of New Jersey," we'd be saddled with the "Real Housewives" label forever.
While U-M's other three players in the 2012 class signed in the fall -- power forward Mitch McGary and wing Glenn Robinson III (both with Indiana hometowns very close to Crown Point) and off-guard Nick Stauskas -- Albrecht can't sign until the spring period begins Wednesday.
Harbaugh said that the Ravens view Osemele primarily as a left guard or a right tackle. With Michael Oher entrenched at right guard, Osemele’s best shot to start will probably be at guard, unless the Ravens move Oher to left tackle and part ways with Bryant McKinnie.

With time running out to spend the grant, Kujawa and the watershed commission received permission from the state to spend the remaining money on less effective urban projects, such as creating rain gardens and storm-water ponds. In the end, the cleanup effort reduced annual phosphorus levels by just 70 pounds, or 8 percent of the total, and local officials returned about $27,000 in unspent funds.

Creating the Empire State Building required one year, three months, and nine days. Between Jan. 22, 1930, and May 1, 1931, some 3,400 workers built what became the world's tallest skyscraper for 42 years, rising 1,454 feet above the sidewalks of New York. (The late, great World Trade Center won that distinction in 1973.) As documentarian Ric Burns noted, the building's steel beams were forged in Pittsburgh and whisked to the site via trains, barges, and trucks. As they were riveted into place, they still were warm.

Did they overpay? Yes. But they were going to have to pull him away from Minnesota. At $10.5 million a season, Cuddyer must produce on this payroll. Rockies' best and highest-paid players have to play well to make their business model work. That means good defense, 25 home runs, 90-to-95 RBIs.

The arrest was unusual in several ways, including Bannister’s score of .000 on an alcohol breath test. The call that alerted law enforcement was made directly to an off-duty deputy sheriff instead of going to 911, and a Gwinnett deputy sheriff made the arrest— the fifth DUI arrest made by the Sheriff’s Department this year — even though the Police Department handles a large majority of such cases in the county.
"It's nothing that I would ever bring up with the players, because it doesn't influence this game," Monson said. "I don't think the number '12' has had anything to do with those teams winning when it came to on the court.

The sound and the fury: Kim G. busts in on Jacqueline and starts cussing up a storm about Danielle in front of Jacqueline's infant son. Nice. She's angry because she found out that Danielle told another friend to stay away from her. (Which is not exactly how Kim G. described their falling-out to me when I interviewed her in June: She told me she had invited Danielle to a fancy party, and Danielle turned her down, and later she found out that Danielle went on her own. Not quite "Et tu Brute?" territory.) Anyway, Kim G. tells Jacqueline that she was right about Danielle all along. Danielle, meanwhile, is still venting to Danny and to the camera about Kim G's treachery, that Kim G. just wanted to gather information from her so she could get in good with Teresa, Caroline and Jacqueline. In perhaps the oddest moment of the evening, Danielle adopts a bizarre hillbilly/baby accent to imitate Kim G.: "If I attack Danielle, maybe, just maybe they'll be my bes' fwends toooo." Danielle and Kim G. meet up at Portobello in Oakland, where Danielle immediately goes on the offensive, accusing her of talking with Teresa, Jacqueline and Caroline. "Absolutely," Kim G. says. I will say this about her, she has never denied playing both sides. She just calls it "being stuck in the middle." Danielle tells her that she never should have passed along intimate details about Danielle to "those animals." Kim G. insists she's been a good friend to Danielle, despite Danielle putting her in some very uncomfortable situations. And then the scenery-chewing commences. Danielle gets up to walk out of the restaurant, and Kim G. follows her out, yelling that she's had enough of Danielle's crap. "Kim G. showed her true colors, and it was a huge display of disgusting," Danielle says in voiceover. As Danielle scurries into her SUV piloted, I believe, by Danny, Kim G. screams -- and I can't vouch entirely for the accuracy of this screed because of all the bleeps -- "You get the (bleep) out of here, you piece of (bleep). Look at you, you're going to be a (bleeping) old lady with fake and square (bleeps)." Fake and square bleeps? Them's fightin' words!

øILB: David Harris, Jets - On his way to being the next London Fletcher: tons of production, no recognition. But he did it all again in 2011 with 86 tackles, five sacks, four picks. Sean Lee, Cowboys: Arguably the best pass defender among NFL backers, he matched Harris' four interceptions for the positional lead in 2011. Lee also amassed 105 tackles despite playing much of the year with a broken wrist that required a club-like cast. D'Qwell Jackson, Browns - Led the AFC with 158 tackles, perhaps not that surprising given so many runners reached the second level of Cleveland's defense. But credit his production after he missed most of 2009 and all of 2010 with injuries. Pat Angerer, Colts - High-motor player took over in the middle for injured Gary Brackett early in the season and responded with 148 stops, second only to Jackson in the AFC. James Anderson, Panthers - He's had to step up for a unit riddled with injuries in recent years and has nearly 200 solo tackles since 2010.

"I think a lot of it is just some guys see better," he said. "Like Miguel Cabrera, I think he's the best hitter in baseball. Sorry to everyone else that's really good. But right now I think he's the best hitter in baseball. Over the years, I've gotten him out pretty good, and I still think he's the best hitter. ... And there are guys like Scott Podsednik, and he's good, but he's nowhere near Pujols, and I can't get him out no matter what I do. It's hard to explain sometimes. Like, it's just I think how they see it out of the hand sometimes. Like Holliday, it's happened. He's hit me real well, where I make my pitch and he still hits it good. I don't understand it sometimes."

The composer specified that the work be performed in its audience’s native language, and the idea of being liberated from supertitles was appealing. Libretti were distributed and a program note suggested “Don’t worry about the words.” But at times it was frustrating to miss entire sections of the work. Even with the projections taking over in place of a set, concert opera is challenging to pull off visually, and the limited amount of room onstage occasionally made for some clutter.

(04-27) 04:00 PDT Mexico City -- On Saturdays, San Angel's main plazas are bustling, crowded and alive. Tourists pour out of taxis, organ grinders emerge, food stands appear. Vendors, many busing in from villages hours away, jostle to sell all manner of works - black pottery, painted Oaxacan wood carvings, cotton tapestries, Day of the Dead altars and quirky paintings of Mexican wrestling heroes. It is a vibrant hive of humanity you would expect from a neighborhood of Mexico City, not unlike the better-known Coyoacán district next door.
The Angels' bid outflanked an organization reluctant to commit more than 20 percent of payroll to one player.

Moyer earned a spot this spring, compiling a 2.77 ERA in 13 innings. He changed speeds more than a New York cabbie, and when he added the cutter last week he bore an striking resemblance to the pitcher he was in Philadelphia in 2010, his last season in the big leagues. When his body showed it could recover in five days after an 89-pitch outing, manager Jim Tracy placed Moyer in the rotation.

I distinctly remember an Italian friend raving to me a few years ago about the new mozzarella bar Obikà she'd just come across in Milan where you could get bufala mozzarella still dripping with milk, fresh from Campania to the south. Now, you have to understand that in Italy, food is always regional. And although, yes, you can buy mozzarella in practically any little deli in Italy, it usually isn't super fresh and mostly it's fior di latte, mozzarella made from cow's milk rather than the much more prized buffalo, which has its own delimited production area just like a wine.
Vera starts off as the maid and confidante of Gloria Mitchell (the riotous Stephanie J. Block, from "9 to 5"), who's dubbed "America's little sweetie pie." To meet the expectations of emigré director Maximillian Von Oster (Kevin Isola, with a wavering accent), the resourceful, articulate Vera pretends to be a tragic, blues-singing woman from the Delta -- and gets hired supporting Gloria in "The Belle of New Orleans."

Soon, armed with unparalleled legal advantages, Zimmerman will get to ask a judge to find the killing was justified, and if that doesn't work, he'll get to make the same case to a jury.
LIUNA held hearings in 2003 about the improper pension contributions. During his testimony, Capasso said that his ties to Local 1001 go back to 1958, when he became a union worker with the Department of Streets and Sanitation during a summer break from college. Capasso said he landed a city job after his aunt, a Local 1001 employee, called City Hall on his behalf.
Or so it seemed.
The comfort of being a local Democratic legend freed him from the conventions of careful and rehearsed lines. Once a young sanitation worker, he famously launched his political career in protest of his slipping into a vat of raw sewage in a poorly lighted building. He wasn't sophisticated and never tried to be. Compared with other major politicians of the time, such as the dismissive and abrasive Cleveland Mayor Michael R. White, Dimora sounded authentic. He was at the top of my Rolodex, his cellphone number circled on the flip card.

The 43-year-old native San Franciscan, celebrated for his unhesitatingly frank opinions and noirish attire, is sure about one thing, however. He wants to project a quirky image during a photo shoot in the apartment where Dashiell Hammett wrote "The Maltese Falcon" (which Anderson has rented and restored), and e-mails to ask whether he can bring a straight-edge razor as a prop.

Notable: The Buckeyes (21-3, 9-2) lead the Spartans (19-5, 8-3) by one game in the Big Ten standings, with Wisconsin and Michigan another half-game back. Michigan State will challenge Ohio State defensively with quick point guard Keith Appling and versatile forward Draymond Green. The size of Michigan State big men Derrick Nix and Adreian Payne could make life a little difficult for OSU leading scorer Jared Sullinger. This feels like another one of those games when the Buckeyes will need William Buford at his best, and he's coming off a career-high 29 in Tuesday's win over Purdue.

As do the tourists. Before we prowled the market, we ate at EP Koberl at Blue, an elegant restaurant in a historic building on Monterey Street.

The "Max" of the title is Maxim Waratt, the composer of the evening's score and an alias for the choreographer himself. The music is of the breathy, rumbling "plinky-plonky" bed-of-sound variety, and unfortunately doesn't add much to the substance of the piece.

A lot has been made of organic cotton and other eco-friendly fabrics made from Tencel, hemp and bamboo as fashion rides the mega-trend of environmentalism.

Don't hate "Footloose" because it's a remake. The dance-movie-love-story-freedom-of-expression thumper is a rollicking good time.
