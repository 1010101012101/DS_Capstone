The reviews - a report by the state Public Utilities Commission and an audit by a state-hired outside firm - underline findings by earlier investigations. PG&E is depicted as pushing finances and cost cutting over public safety. One example: It sought to boost allowable gas-pressure levels while neglecting to seriously test the strength of the buried line that exploded September 2010, killing eight and destroying 38 homes. The gas-fed flames burned for more than 90 minutes while PG&E scrambled to find a way to shut off the line.

Airlines set the price for mileage tickets much as they do in cash tickets: As seats sell, or strong demand is predicted, the price generally goes up. So, when the cash price of a ticket was the lowest fare-class set for a trip, perhaps $300, you had better odds of getting a seat for 25,000 miles, the lowest class of award. With the cash price moving to higher fare classes, say $500, awards also may move to higher levels.

The FBI is still analyzing the explosive, which was intended to be concealed in a passenger's underwear. Officials said it was an upgrade over the bomb that failed to detonate on board an airplane over Detroit on Christmas 2009.

Hank Wesch: "I'm going with Union Rags. He cleverly avoided the historical jinx of Breeders' Cup Juvenile winners attempting to complete the Derby double by getting beat by Hansen in the Juvenile last fall. He showed me enough in winning the Fountain of Youth and in a game second to Take Charge Indy in the Florida Derby that I believe he has what it takes to win in Kentucky -- given a decent post position draw plus some racing luck and a slightly better ride than he got from Julien Leparoux in the Florida Derby. And there's still enough of the turf writer in me that I'd like to see the best story win. Out of a bunch of potential very good ones, I think Union Rags, with trainer Michael Matz (Barbaro) and the owners, is No. 1 in my estimation."

Turgeon didn’t seem to mesh with Stoglin during stretches of the season, particularly the first month. But the only player who Turgeon hasn't seemed to reach was Ashton Pankey.

Although the players were able to experience a few moments of laughter, all they had to do was look into the stands of Jeld-Wen Field during training sessions this week to see the more serious side to the team's problems.

Certainly they are worthy of much prolonged looking. "Scream" gives us a single figure with an image of the face from Edvard Munch's "The Scream" on its shoulder. The deep blues and screaming orange make the title manifest. "Hen Courage" places the figure of a vulnerable girl in the center of a circle of birds flying at her. The saturated color in varying shades of blue and the menacing birds indicate a dangerous situation.

To tell you the truth, I always wanted to be a sketch comedian and a comedy actor. But the thing that really made standup look like fun to me was Richard Lewis’ first special on Showtime. I was like, “Wow, I would love to go onstage and be able to do that.” With Carlin and Pryor, I was younger, and I was like, “Wow, I can’t imagine doing something like that.” But Richard Lewis made me really want to do it.

Parkway South got contributions from all over the court, but none were bigger than center Mark Waller. Matched up against De Soto's 6-foot-10 Colin Ferguson, Waller scored 12 points and set the defensive tone. Ferguson, a Southeast Missouri State recruit, finished the game with three points and was completely perplexed around the basket. After struggling to find his scoring stroke in the first half, Ferguson's touches diminished as the game went on.
March will continue to be a key piece of the Zumwalt East lineup, as should Collin Zurweller, who is a former first-team player who suffered an injury at the tail end of the basketball season and missed the baseball season entirely.

We also tried the chawan mushi ($18), where the egg custard is sliced and fanned in a bowl with a broth and local sea urchin; it was like eating creme brulee on a windy day at the ocean.

That might say as much about the veracity of campaigning politicians as it does about the fairness of our reporters, but it is only one measure of how the reporting in PolitiFact plays it down the middle. Another is that only once since PolitiFact Ohio started in July -- the number of stories has now reached nearly 120 -- has Higgs had to publish a correction. And he has never had to change the accompanying "truth-o-meter" rating because it had relied on some erroneous or overlooked information.

Because (Cheech and Chong notwithstanding) you can consume regularly and still be a hard-working, responsible, creative, well-regarded employee.
In the first few decades after the Titanic, the disparity in survival of the third-class passengers wasn't mentioned. It wasn't until Walter Lord revived the tale of the Titanic in his best-selling book "A Night To Remember" that the issue of class fairness was revisited, Biel said. And by the time Cameron's movie came out in the 1990s, the story had gone from the helpful rich to the mostly despicable first-class passengers.

A: Please, never use that pest fellow. Rodenticides (poisons) are very dangerous for all animals, or they wouldn't kill mice. Any product that will kill an animal will certainly affect another animal. Maybe it wouldn't kill the dog, but it could make the dog very sick. Is that an option? I would hope not. Never use rodenticides anywhere for any pest.
In the interim, a handful of hotels, spas and wilderness retreats has opened. You can now have a world-class massage, then drive about 100 miles on an empty dirt road to Cape Leveque to swim on magazine-cover quality beaches "with no one within cooee," as the Aussies say, referring to a shrill shout. You can then return to a chilled sweet, dry Sémillon and a meal of king prawns or pearl meat (tastes like abalone).

"And when you're fat, at least in my family, you're not cute or you're not beautiful. So for the longest time, I equated being beautiful with being thin.

Bynum sat at his locker with his legs encased in black contraptions that resembled oversized ski boots.

It will take several weeks for dispensaries to receive their licenses, but dispensaries that applied for a license by Friday will be allowed to stay open while they wait.
A small town hums with industry and prosperity. A big-box retailer opens its doors and puts this hamlet on the map. Bargains abound. Hard-earned dollars go even further. But this category killer keeps squeezing manufacturers in the name of protecting consumers. Jobs go overseas. The local factory shuts down. Downtown withers.
Plus, since the ham is already cooked and you use canned white beans, this is about as good as it gets for a tasty dinner in about 30 minutes. When I made this most recently, I did it on a lazy weekend morning then put it in the fridge to eat later, at the end of a busy afternoon.

Bill Ulrich of Le Sueur, Minn., used several RotNots in his own large garden after Schroeder, a co-worker, gave him some to try. "I was a guinea pig," he said. He found that his RotNot-supported watermelons ripened without blemishes. "The watermelons didn't get worm marks. You get a cleaner-looking melon. There were no green spots in the bottom when I cut 'em open."

The annual cost of caring for a dog varies according to size, breed and the individual dog. Smaller dogs eat less, so your food costs will be lower. Purebred dogs are known to have more health problems because of their narrower gene pool, which means you could end up spending more on medication and veterinary visits than you would with a Heinz 57. And you're going to pay more to board a Newfoundland than you would to board a Yorkie.

"It's not about wrapping my head around what happened in the past," she said. "It's what happens next and what did I learn and move on. It's really easy with this schedule to dwell on things and let one weekend affect the next. Because I get so wrapped up in the results, the hurdle is to disconnect from what just happened and move on and look at it as a positive that you get another week and race to make it right. I don't feel I have to do anything. My goal is run competitively."

There's not much room for cost-benefit analysis. Commanders have a responsibility to identify at-risk soldiers. They can't pass the buck to generic medical screening with limited utility.

The Pats and Giants: A match that is the direct residue of the late Pete Rozelle’s determination to find the ultimate 100-yard wall-to-wall parity. Forget the fact that the Patriots sort of backed in after Baltimore missed a short field-goal that would have tied the game. That, after all, is football. But eye to eye and belly to belly this is one of those rare times that the two best teams in all of football have made it to what is always overbilled as the season’s ultimate game.
