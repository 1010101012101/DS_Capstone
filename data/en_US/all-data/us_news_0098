Firing Hue Jackson as coach after one season, when a Raiders team that had marginal talent and injuries nearly made the playoffs, was surprising. But this is Oakland after all, and a 1-4 finish after a 7-4 start will create changes. New GM Reggie McKenzie went with former Broncos defensive coordinator Dennis Allen as his new coach. Building around QB Carson Palmer and RB Darren McFadden will be key.
The 6-foot-5 swingman from Bishop Gorman High in Las Vegas is widely considered either the best or second-best prep senior in the country, a rare talent whose imprint could transcend what is likely to be his one and only college season.

As I proposed in this column three years ago, it's time for Mexico and all other Latin American countries to create a common Latin American visa that allows Americans, Europeans and Asians to visit all countries in the region without visa hassles. When it comes to tourism, Mexico and its neighbors are sitting on a gold mine.
July 23: The Spring Standards, The Amboys
My second-floor room was comfortable but bland, with neutral tropical prints, slate floors and a canopied bed. The bath was large, with a deep tub, separate shower and twin sinks. (Most garden-level rooms also have outdoor lava rock showers.) There was a safe, iron and board, mini-fridge and even a toaster (the general store sells bread). Black and gold bamboo-print, Japanese-style robes hung in the closet. I'd return after dinner to find the king bed turned down and slippers by it. I'd turn on the ceiling fan, open the lanai doors and doze off to the sound of the surf.

"We were so hopeful," Martins said. "Now it seems we've traded the guns of traffickers for the guns of police. These are official, so we can complain of abuses, and that's better. But in the end it's not guns that are going to make things better and convince the people who live here: It's services, things like running water, sewage, and shoring up unstable hillsides that can slip when it rains. And those aren't here."

When Greece ran into trouble a year later, the conclave, whose existence has never before been reported, had yet to agree on a strategy. In a prelude to a cantankerous public debate that would later delay Europe's response to the euro-zone debt crisis until the eleventh hour, the task force struggled to surmount broad disagreement over whether and how the euro zone should rescue one of its own. It never found the answer.
"If we're truly going to make sure we're not at the mercy of spikes in gas prices every year, the answer isn't just to drill more -- because we're already drilling more," Obama said.

"It was like watching a rerun of his statements on Iraq five years earlier," Biden said. "Iran is not a nuclear threat to the United States of America.

After Simon was removed from the game following the fourth inning, five relievers combined to pitch six no-hit innings as the Orioles beat New York, 5-4, in 10 innings. With a walk-off RBI single, second baseman Robert Andino gave the Orioles their second extra-innings win against the Yankees in as many days, but the unheralded relievers were the heroes of this one.

In Friday's ruling, Judge Milan Smith said Crosby's sentence was constitutional in light of his offense and criminal record.

And now, as the presidential campaign heats up, her latest venture, "Breakdown," features a Michele Bachmann-esque character running for Senate, a bloviating yet powerful conservative talk-show host, anti-immigrant hysteria and, because Paretsky also has a sense of humor, a "Twilight"-like young adult horror novel penned by the delightfully-named Boadicea Jones.

Some saw that as a sign that he had finally relinquished control of the message. But Woods and his Nike sponsor never considered not taking Tiger's dead father's words out of context and applying them as learning curve-based spin to his sordid sex scandal.

Across the Mississippi River, in Iowa, there's just a week to go until the Ames straw poll. Pretty much everyone who's actively seeking the GOP nod will be in Iowa sometime next week, even Mitt Romney and Jon Huntsman, who at least officially aren't competing in the poll. Based on their published schedules, Tim Pawlenty, Michele Bachmann and Rick Santorum look to be investing the most energy. No real surprise there. Pawlenty needs a strong showing to flip the perception that he's stuck in low gear. Bachmann hopes to secure her position as the Tea Party alternative to Romney and gain enough momentum that she's not eclipsed if Perry enters the race. Santorum's looking to make a breakthrough with "values voters"; he got a nice bump this week when the Quinnipiac Poll showed him even with Obama in Pennsylvania. Yes, Santorum's a native son there, but a landslide loss in his 2006 Senate race has been an anchor in this campaign. Evidence that the folks back home might give him a second look is good news.
øAnd then there's the appeal of many of those possibly tying the knot.
A Kreps Middle School parent claims her eighth grade daughter was suspended for wearing a Confederate Flag shirt to school. Jane West claims school leaders overstepped their bounds and violated her daughter's free speech. She's also thinking about withdrawing her daughter, Torri Albrecht, from the school.

School officials, though, say the eighth grader was not suspended because of what she was wearing, but they would not say the reason for the suspension, citing confidentiality issues.

The contests overshadowed Romney's continued progress toward the GOP presidential nomination. He won the GOP presidential primaries in Indiana, North Carolina and West Virginia, drawing close to the 1,144 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination.

* Los Angeles is a more dangerous threat than London as a potential transfer desitination for E. Stanley Kroenke. And you'll notice how the London Calling series was structured: three years, with no commitment for 2015. Kroenke isn't stupid. If the Rams move to LA in 2015, he can't pull a home game out of SoCal to play it in England. Not in the first season in LA. The timing is perfect; Kroenke's agreement with London matches the three years left on his Edward Jones lease. And after that, open door ... if he chooses to take it. And by helping the NFL plant the league's flag in an important market such as London, Kroenke strengthens his support among NFL owners should he opt to move the Rams. He'll need their votes. Slam dunk.

The crumb is extremely soft, and the cream-cheese frosting rather dense, so the cake can be challenging to frost. The best approach is to apply a paper-thin coating of frosting to the exterior of the cake (it's OK if it catches crumbs), and chill it for 20 to 30 minutes before adding the rest, which should then spread easily.
Luscombe noted that for a child born in the U.S., you can claim expenses for the adoption credit in the year following the year you spend the money, even if the adoption is in process and has not been finalized.

The Derby didn't know, and maybe doesn't care, but because it didn't have a big-name horse running this year, it came perilously close to not even making the front cover of The Oregonian sports page on race day.

To be honest, I don't remember actually enjoying those childhood treks to the Jewel Box. Flowers never really turned me on, and there's a good chance I was miserable about wearing a tie and uncomfortable new shoes.

But given the right gown, wisely chosen accessories, and a certain amount of confidence, even a Na'vi warrior like Neytiri here can pull off a show-stopping red carpet look -- only Marion Cotillard could wear this Jean Paul Gaultier fish-scale gown better. (IOh wait, she did.)
With his drawled wisecracks and quick wit, Dean charmed many fans. But in both entertainment and business circles, he was also known for his tough hide. He fired bandmate Roy Clark, who went onto "Hee Haw" fame, for showing up late for gigs.

And while those probably weren't the exacttraits the Angels zeroed in on when they discussed Aybar's future during the off-season, they obviously liked what they did see.

All sorts of objections could have been made, including Perez's rehab time in spring training after hurting himself by overthrowing, and the skimpy three appearances he made against big-league hitters after recovering.

Experts say export economics from Oregon are a slam dunk, potentially doubling the price that Canadian and U.S. producers net for their gas domestically.

A large influx of immigrants have come from countries without strong sport hunting traditions.

A Sunset Carson (1920-1990) was an actor in Western B-movies and TV shows from the 1940s until about 1985. He started out as a rodeo rider in the United States and South America and toured with Tom Mix's Wild West Show.

He was listed as Sonny "Sunset" Carson in an early 1944 movie, and after that became just Sunset Carson. The value of Carson's boots depends on their style and condition. He was a minor star, so the boots probably would sell for about what any good cowboy boots would bring.

I still haven't," Marley says by phone the next afternoon, less than 24 hours after the opening-night premiere of"Marley,"a 144-minute biographical documentary about the reggae icon, at Colony Theater in Miami Beach. She pauses – there's a faint sniffing in the background – and then presses on. "The last three days in Miami were the most traumatic for me – I've experienced nothing like that since. I would remember Daddy in bed, asking me to grab him the pee-pee pan, because he couldn't get out of bed to use the bathroom, and I just started getting sad."
I laughed. My friend, a know-it-all author, loves to give advice. I didn't need it; I already knew I would fall in love with Capri.

But the wholehearted support of evangelicals, who accounted for nearly one-fourth of all ballots cast in recent presidential elections, will not come without conditions, some leaders warned.

Thirteen of the 20 players from Ohio State's super-hyped, highly-ranked 2008 recruiting class remain in Columbus, with 12 projected as starters for 2011. That's pretty good.

He said in neither instance did he think replay was going to be the right response to getting the call right.

When the first-round playoff series against the Nashville Predators begins Wednesday at Bridgestone Arena, the Wings' chances of victory look all the better with Datsyuk at his most dangerous.

From the '90s forward, teams like Pittsburgh, Detroit, New Jersey and Colorado took turns trading the Cup, combining for nine titles in a 13-year span.

Politicians of all parties have been lying since the beginning of the republic. The two previous presidential administrations are perhaps best known for lies or untruths -- see Lewinsky, Monica, and weapons of mass destruction.

While district officials first planned to completely merge the magnet program with another elementary school program, they backtracked after parents worried Sojourner would not survive such a quick expansion.
Hackensack University Medical Center's bid to reopen the Pascack Valley Hospital was met with support from area residents and lawmakers, who complained that residents needing urgent care had to travel across the county for services. Then-candidate Chris Christie made re-opening the facility a campaign promise in the governor's race.
Nobody's perfect. The menu could have more muscle, perhaps venturing into full-scale entrees. I'd be curious to see what chef Zoellin might come up with for a larger plate at say, the $18 to $22 price point. How does he do with sauces? What about fuller cuts of meat? A plate of nicely prepared vegetables?
The search will start with Temple head coach Steve Addazio and Florida International coach Mario Cristobal, a Schiano disciple. There are other worthy candidates out there, too. Rutgers no longer has to take a flyer on a young assistant coach as it did with Schiano in 2001.

- Select a saute pan or skillet with high sides to allow the food to "jump." To begin, heat the pan on low. Increase heat to medium and add olive oil, clarified butter or a combination of the two. After ripples appear in the oil, but before it starts to pop, it's hot enough to add the food.
The Costco announcement seemed like a major step forward, but that deal had to be redrafted, and now it, too, awaits judicial approval. Yet the decision by Wal-Mart, Valero and Casey could be a welcome sign of progress on the hot-fuel issue.
I haven't found a person in baseball yet who thinks the Yankees were suckered by the Mariners on the trade for Michael Pineda. However, I have heard more than one person beginning to question the way the Yankees develop young pitchers.

One big reason is that pre-retirees often wrongly assume that Medicare covers the cost of long-term care, Carter says. That is a wake-up call that Americans need good financial advice to prepare for their future health care costs, he says.
These changes track pretty closely to what was on offer two years ago, but Jerry Powell, the publisher and editor of Resource Recycling, a national magazine based in Oregon, says some key changes have been made since then.
But what's been even more encouraging has been an overall jump in quality. If Season 2 hasn't given rise to new catchphrases (the show made fun of its own "put a bird on it" mantra with a duo proclaiming "We can pickle that!"), that's no great loss. More important is how the creative team (which included writers Kasey Dornetto and Bill Oakley, a veteran of "The Simpsons") studied last season and, by and large, fixed what didn't work and amplified what did.
Last summer had similar weather conditions and a big bug boom. Another wet spring and cool summer meant two buggy summers in a row.
It may have yet to meet its self-proclaimed status as an international organization.
Final statistics on the rebates will be issued by the federal government in early summer.

Legroom and headroom is great in the second row and decent in the third row. The seats in the "way back" are low to the floor, but taller adults can still sit comfortably. I am 6 feet, 2 inches tall with my Tom Cruise shoes on, and seven of me could comfortably handle road trips of any duration in the JX. Just pack a lot of food. Yes, the front and middle seats are preferable, but adults won't feel as if they lost a bet if they're relegated to row No. 3.

Halting my first urge to call him was the camp's policy to notify parents if a camper is in the infirmary overnight. We had not been contacted. I e-mailed: "Hi, this is Joe's mom. I received a letter that he wasn't feeling well. Do you know anything about this?" The assistant director replied, "I've been out on the grounds today and I've seen Joe participating in his activities."

His brother, NASCAR driver Ryan Truex, joined MVC Chief Administrator Raymond Martinez at the stadium.
Smith hopes, based on his family history, to live until 90. If he does, he will have earned an internal rate of return on his original $150,000 investment of 6.8 percent. That's like earning a 6.8 percent annualized yield on a CD -- a great return for any retiree. But that's only if he lives until 90. If he dies in nine years, his rate of return will be closer to 0.6 percent.
Higgins said the best strategy would have been to consult a beekeeper to remove the hive or a trained exterminator licensed to use insecticides not available to homeowners.

The top Democrat on the House education committee, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress has bipartisan concern about the rising costs of college and thinks the president's plan will open up a conversation about the problem.

Tucked into a sheltered nook in the Bahía de La Paz on the Sea of Cortés (a.k.a. Golfo de California), the capital of Baja California Sur has labored, workmanlike and unheralded, to keep goods coming in and out of the peninsula since the 16th century. Serendipitously, development of Los Cabos siphoned off the glitz-seeking hedonists and left this utterly charming and thoroughly authentic city to the rest of us. Everyday life focuses on day-to-day work rather than tourism, yet it has all a modern traveler needs — a beguiling malecón, pleasant and affordable lodgings, seaside restaurants, movie theaters, a surfeit of festivals, and white-sand beaches with splendid sunsets that outdo Los Cabos by a mile.

There are signs that Hester is fond of Sir William, and indications that he was a non-starter at marital relations. Freddie, on the other hand, brings great passion to her bed, but a fellow can't subsist on passion alone, and recently he has been neglecting Hester for the pastimes of drinking and golf. Her day, at least the one in the film, are passed in Freddie's musty brown bed-sitter with a gas fire, which she uses early on that same day to attempt suicide.

“It shows the loss means nothing,” McDonald said.
Some things, it seems, are timeless.
We would, again, like to make it clear that Jason's incident was in no way the result of drugs or alcohol in his body. The preliminary diagnosis he received is called brief reactive psychosis, an acute state brought on by extreme exhaustion, stress and dehydration. Though new to us, the doctors say this is a common experience given the great mental, emotional and physical shock his body has gone through in these last two weeks. Even for us, it's hard to understand the sudden transition from relative anonymity to worldwide attention - both raves and ridicules, in a matter of days.

Most of them were born around the time of Tiananmen Square, the historic 1989 confrontation between pro-democracy forces -- many of them students -- and the Communist regime. It still casts a shadow across Chinese society -- blocked or censored Internet sites are merely the most obvious manifestation -- even though one young man (who asked me not to use his name) said it remains rarely discussed by his parents and their friends, and then only as "The Event."
The program may be the first of its kind in the country, said Karen Kalish, who began the effort. She got the idea while riding along with a police officer about 10 years ago. She purposefully requested to ride from 7 p.m. to midnight on a Saturday.

One TripAdvisor traveler noted, "I want to believe that everything that we experienced was real. We did record some orbs flying around our room while we slept. (We set up our video recorder on night vision)."

Downtown’s technology covers everything south of Canal. Another covers Midtown to 60th Street. Sensors are on buildings, lampposts, fences. Eyes everywhere. Another alert is correlated to 911.

Trouble strikes the Ducks on 3rd and 5 from the their own 40 with 3:26 remaining and the score tied 21-21. Oregon's Darron Thomas drops back to pass, gets blindsided by Wisconsin linebacker Mike Taylor and fumbles. Badgers' defensive end Louis Nzegwu scoops up the ball and returns it 33 yards for a touchdown, giving the Badgers the lead, 28-21. The play is reviewed, but the call stands. Thomas goes on to an up and down night -- several high passes and a third quarter interception -- but finishes with a strong statistical line: 17 of 23 for 268 yards, three touchdowns and the one interception.

The party will be a benefit for Lutheran Social Services of Illinois, one of this state's most indispensable organizations. The featured presentation will be a roast of yours truly. Cash bar.

"If the euro-fanatics win, nothing will remain of Serbia," said Zoran Krasic, a parliamentary candidate for the nationalist Serbian Radical Party, which now holds more than 20% of National Assembly seats.

He isn’t the only player in the NFL capable of switching between English and Spanish on the fly — there are a handful of bilingual players such as San Diego’s Luis Castillo, Chicago’s Alberto Garza, plus Gonzalez and Sanchez that have made it a point to learn the league — but, behind his robust production and salsa touchdown dances that pay homage to his Puerto Rican roots, Cruz has become a bona fide star in just his second season after going undrafted out of UMass.
The book's breezy methodology makes for some problems: It's often difficult to tell just how representative a study or survey, cited by the author, might be. But Lehrer largely avoids the sort of gauzy hypotheses and gross generalizations that undermined Gladwell's 2008 book, "Outliers."
The film also won't feature Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanov, AKA Black Widow.

But Jack Chin, a former University of Arizona law professor who now teaches at University of California-Davis School of Law, said it may not be so clear-cut. He said the justices could strike down the lower court's injunction by saying it is constitutional to check someone's legal status as long as authorities don't detain individuals any longer than they did before.

On the road, the GS 350 is finally a Lexus that can dance. The steering is quick and responsive, and it provides good feedback to the driver. The car itself is nicely balanced and poised, even under dramatic circumstances. It moves with a dynamic confidence that earns the moniker "sport sedan," rather than abusing the term as a platitude. Agility is favored over raw power, though the GS could use a little more of the latter.
The politically sensitive trade deficit with China was unchanged in October at $28.1 billion. Both imports from China and U.S. exports to that country rose to record level. So far, it is on track to set a record as the highest imbalance the United States has ever recorded with a single country.

3. Viral Video: Kate Upton does the 'Cat Daddy' dance. The racy video is the latest instance where the Sports Illustrated swimsuit model has caused a stir. Just a few weeks ago, the 5-foot, 10-inch model appeared in -- shocker -- a swimsuit dressed as a nun in the new comedy "The Three Stooges," much to the ire of the Catholic League.

The lowdown: Oregon and Colorado are tied for fourth place going into tonight, and the Ducks must sweep this weekend in order to finish no worse than third in conference standings, which would give them a bye the first round of the Pac-12 tournament.
Freshman center Alex Len also had eight points in the second half and blocked two shots.
He wrote symphonies and concertos, solos and chamber music that were accessible rather than academic, and perhaps that's why his music fell out of style. In the decades following World War II, many composers felt the need to constantly push the envelope, writing music to impress their colleagues on music faculties, with the audience as an afterthought.
As a result, its highly unusual food web is reorganizing, as warmer water species of plankton become more prevalent. These shifts at the bottom of the food web could have important implications for all of the creatures that live in the lake, they say.

The wear in both reactors is considered premature. Edison has plugged a total of 321 of the worn tubes in both reactors, and while plugging of worn tubes is common practice and does not affect the generators' performance, it is unusual so early in the life of the generators.
Mirroring Game 4s escape on Saturday in Orlando, things were not easy for Indiana until the very end. A 15-point first-quarter advantage disappeared early in the third period. The Magic, riding the hot-shooting of guard Jameer Nelson most of the way, led 71-69 at the end of three. Nelson would lead Orlando with a game-high 27 points.

Mike Right of AAA Missouri raised similar questions about the need for a public vote.
A little more than two years ago, Alex Ebert, frontman for the popular new wave-indie group Ima Robot, holed up in an L.A. apartment and tried to write his way through a bit of an existential crisis. As weeks passed, other musicians joined him, and what eventually emerged was the 11-member infectiously joyous gypsy-folk carnival known as Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros. I think we tried to create our own utopia, muses Ebert. The groups only constant is a state of childlike wonder, and its sound can fall anywhere from 60s psychedelia to dance rock to sea shanty. After blowing away crowds at this years South by Southwest fest, the bands first album, Up from Below, is due out in July on Eberts Community Records label. Nearly everyone had been involved in the 80s-inspired indie scene for quite some time, says Spacelands Frank. Suddenly theyre a polyrhythmic, polyphonic band with danceable undertones. Its amazing.
If the raves from a few scouts I've talked to about Sgarbossa are to be believed, Sherman's deal with the Sharks could turn out to be a big-time fleece job.
7835 Delmont St, $45,000
Baseball fans in St. Louis have long been known as purists. Pitching, defense and fundamentals. How did we get so far away from that? Carpenter is still a servicable pitcher but, in my opinion, will never be "feared" again. Lohse, Mac and Westbrook are number four type starters. The bullpen has one veteran lefthander who can't retire lefties, a couple of veteran right handers who are arsonists, and some flame throwers who can't be trusted yet. The third baseman is awol again, the shortstop is a second baseman, the second baseman is an outfielder,the right fielder is a first baseman and the center fielder couldn't throw Miklasz out trying to

With his runner-up finish, Simpson moved to the top of the money list by $363,029 over Luke Donald, the No. 1 player in the world ranking. Both players have entered the season-ending tournament next week in Disney, though Donald’s task became a lot more difficult.

Thus, a district spokeswoman said, the state law does not apply. A lawyer who helped draft the statute suggested to Ms. Holland that this interpretation, shall we say, is improbable.
Hood picked a multicolored limestone from Yorkshire (also used in London's Trafalgar Square) as paving around the building. It comes from a quarry close to the home of British artist Andy Goldsworthy, who was commissioned to do a sculpture for the entry court. Once again, landscape designer and artist were able to collaborate. The sculptor used split boulders from the same quarry for "Drawn Stone 2005." Goldsworthy crafted a continuous fissure in Hood's pavers that leads into the entry court. It's an allusion to the seismic fault-line that rendered the old de Young obsolete. The single crack travels up across the first large boulder Goldsworthy set inside the entryway and spills down the other side where tributaries of cracks fracture the entire courtyard.
A man and woman apparently brought the child to the Beth Israel Hospital in Newark, but the man left.
At Ale House, he used reclaimed wood from the shuttered Chesapeake Restaurant, the one by the Charles Theater, to decorate and renovate; and the bar is made out of an old bowling alley top.

On Jan. 17, 2008, Anderson wrote Burrows from Coffee Creek to update her predicament.
I know she's right. I have not seen Margaret, who is now 41, lose it like that for years, but I know I will face her autism for the rest of my life, and her behavior is just one question.
So the Jets were a better deal for the Broncos. And the Jets were a better deal for Tebow. In Jacksonville, Tebow would have been the No. 3 quarterback. Ahead of him would have been Blaine Gabbert, who as a rookie last year was the NFL's worst starting quarterback but will get every chance before he is dumped because he was the No. 10 overall draft choice, and veteran Chad Henne, a proven starter who will get $4.1 million this year. Tebow would have been no more than a package player in Jacksonville.
The psychological drama, produced by Tyler Davidson of South Russell, was picked up by a distributor just before its debut at the Sundance Film Festival in January.

Parking is limited at the church, which celebrates five mass services on Sunday for the nearly 6,300 families in the congregation. Parishioners would likely be vying with stadiumgoers for spaces, Bauer said. The priest also believes a new stadium would make the basilica "less accessible" to the neighborhood's homeless, who depend on the church's charitable outreach programs.
Goodell has made an effort to emphasize player safety in recent seasons. The NFL is facing dozens of lawsuits brought by more than 1,000 former players who say the league didnt do enough to warn them about  or protect them from  the dangers of concussions.
"We need our second unit,'' Vogel said before the game. "We can't play our starters the full game. It has come and gone throughout the year. Sometimes our starters are the guys that are struggling and the second unit picks them up. We'll keep the normal rotation, and if a certain unit isn't getting it done, then we'll adjust.''
Paul Dales, a senior economist at Capital Economics, says it would take a bigger shift in the global economy - say, a deep recession in Europe or a slowdown in Asia's manufacturing - for pump prices to drop noticeably. Either event would slow oil demand, depressing prices.
Finally, the firefighters rally at Van Ness, a natural wide firebreak across the city with multiple deep cisterns, expanded after the 1906 conflagration. They make the difference -- the fire is turned; slowly, after five hours of exhausting work, they begin bringing it under control, despite mattress-size pieces of burning roofs that fly through the air, threatening to carry the blaze to Russian Hill.

"Will the tax credit be renewed?" says Walker. "I don't know. But I would argue that the $32 million raised and $20 million awarded means a lot of people have made investments in this thing and that before you decide to eliminate the credit, you should give it a little thought."
Plainfield’s verdant Cedar Brook Park is usually a placid corner of the Union County park system. That won’t be the case this weekend. It will host a car show, carnival rides for kids, a marketplace and lots of festival food.

The U-T asks Fletcher to "make a promise that he will not take funds, either directly or indirectly from organized labor." That sounds like tea party lingo.
The years have not dimmed his memory of his ordeal.
It's a half-baked (excuse the pun) psychology experiment, but it's also a kind of metaphor for the relationship that Violet Barnes (Emily Blunt) and Tom Solomon (Jason Segel) find themselves in. The couple at the heart of this amiable, shambling romantic comedy - a comedy laced with darker undertones, and sex and potty shtick - start to feel like old doughnuts themselves: familiar but still desirable, a little stale, yet still really sweet. But somewhere lurking in the recesses of their temporal lobes, there's the notion that perhaps there's a fresher doughnut - a better match - waiting out there.
Martin Griff/The Times of TrentonTrenton Mayor Douglas H. Palmer addresses the case of a 7-year-old girl allegedly sexually assaulted at an apartment complex on Sunday.

Though he's not a defendant, the case revolves around Trevor Cook and the $194 million international fraud scheme that he ran from the Twin Cities from 2005 until it imploded in July 2009. The scheme is second only to the $3.65 billion fraud perpetrated by the now-imprisoned Tom Petters. But in some ways, it's more interesting.
