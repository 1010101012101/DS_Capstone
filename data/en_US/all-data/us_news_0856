A: I've seen a few complaints. One of the songs is called "Guitar Slinger," and it just made sense. I play a lot more guitar on this than on records past. I never try too hard to accentuate the guitar side of me on my records, because I was trying to have hits, and to write great songs, and not all songs need to have somebody shredding all over them all the time. I think that on a few of these songs the fade-out's a couple minutes of me really playing, and that's what my friends have called me for a while, guitar slinger.

Though I don't expect all of the readers to start biking to work from this point forward, I do encourage all of you to give it a try if you are physically able and don't have an excessively long distance to travel. It's also important to map out a safe route for biking (which isn't always possible). But if you are in a position to give it a try, I hope you do. I think you'll enjoy it as much as I do. And you never know, you might rescue a few new animal friends too.

HARTFORD—A $700 million bond sale in November gave Connecticut the money to build schools, fix roads and repair sewer systems. The sale came with something else: a $65 million upfront payment that helps Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, balance the budget, but also results in higher interest costs for future governors.

One of the requirements for the Cookies Count Try-It badge is a planning and budget exercise where the troop discusses future activities and goals and how they could be achieved and what they cost. When planning the meeting, Nicole and I expected to hear a lot of enthusiasm for high-ticket or elaborate outings, but we were pleasantly surprised when the first thing the girls came up with and the unanimous activity of choice was "to help a charity." The St. Michael's School of Clayton and the Church of St. Michael and St. George put a great deal of emphasis on social responsibility and giving back to the community, and it's clearly taken root. The girls were certainly motivated by incentive patches and prizes that are earned at certain sales levels, but I think our Brownies really take pride in being part of a larger organization and able to contribute to its goals and live its values. The cookie sale was one way of demonstrating that pride.

In last year's deadly cantaloupe cases, within weeks of the first Colorado health department test match, agents narrowed the probe to one packing shed at one farm. The FDA and growers launched an overhaul of cantaloupe-growing practices.

One pioneer researcher, Dr. Gene Cohen, called it "intellectual sweating." Cohen, who died last year, was the first chief of the Center on Aging at the National Institute of Mental Health. He advised people to "make it a point to learn something new, instead of turning to hormones or ginkgo biloba." His research found that the later adult years can be a time of great creativity. As long as people stimulate their brains by learning and trying new things, new brain cells are created and – barring disease -- there's almost limitless capacity for intellectual growth.

Sheltering Mr. Chen would present the U.S. with a dilemma. Keeping Mr. Chen at a U.S. facility could strain relations with China. Turning over Mr. Chen to Chinese authorities might subject him to harsh punishment, which could be politically damaging to the Obama administration.

Something else doesn’t make sense to Crane: the abbey’s review board, which secretly investigates alleged sex abuse. His sons claim the board denies abuse, bullies alleged victims, buys silence and buries cases. The panel, all three Cranes say, prevents the public from seeing the insidious behavior occurring behind the abbey walls.

The story has been heavily revamped, but I'd love to get Bolton and Wodehouse on the Ouija board to see what they'd make of Broderick's absentee portrayal, a performance so oddly lackluster that it's as if he isn't so much playing a role as causally trying one out for future reference.
The rib eye is $28, the gnocchi is $25 and the young chicken is $21.50. But there are several dishes that cost less. If you believe in quality and ethics, these prices will make sense. Wines range from $4.75 to $12 by the glass and $20 to $44 by the bottle.

I said that 1979 was year of testing  testing whether these people that fill the freeways of California have the vision to prepare for the year 2000. Is Alexander Solzhenitsyn correct when he says that: A decline in courage may be the most striking feature which an outside observer notices in the west in our days? Will we make the sacrifices to protect our land and to create the new energy sources that will power our factories? Will we invest in the information revolution and continue to dominate the conquest of outer space? Will we see beyond the stereotypes and embrace our human diversity?

Five of the six central characters in this musical by Dan Collins (book and lyrics) and Julianne Wick Davis (music) are transsexuals. The patriarch of the clan is the 50-something Robert (Annette O’Toole), who’s dying, ironically enough, of cervical cancer. His partner is Lola (Jeff McCarthy), a hulking figure who struggles to wear blouses that downplay her massive shoulders. Robert also has two young men in his life that he treats as sons: Maxwell (Jeffrey Kuhn) and Cas (Todd Cer-veris), whose respective girlfriends are Cori (Natalie Joy Johnson) and Stephanie (Robin Skye); only Stephanie was born female.
There were no red flags hanging from Ingram that caused the drop. It was Smith and the Chargers' luck that everyone else in front of them seemed to go nuts and Ingram slipped. He can line up in many spots. As ESPN's Jon Gruden, who had Ingram at the top of his board, said: "He can return kicks; he can cover kicks." Draft guru Kiper said, "After Luck and RGII, this was the best pick."
We expect some hypocrisy in politics, but it was still jaw-dropping to behold Republicans accusing President Obama of politicizing the anniversary of the killing of Osama bin Laden. Wasn't it just eight years ago that the GOP organized an entire presidential campaign -- including the choreography of its 2004 national convention -- around the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and George W. Bush's response to them?

More broadly, they're supposed to help students navigate one of the most confusing aspects of the college matchmaking process. While a school's "list price" is usually easy enough to identify, students often don't hear until long after they've applied and gotten acceptance letters what will be their "net price" -- the sometimes substantially lower cost after scholarships and discounts are applied.
In the weeks after the news about Orozco surfaced, Babeu also drew scrutiny for his time at the helm of a controversial Massachusetts private school for troubled youths more than a decade ago.

As money got tighter in recent years, most of the state's 600-odd school districts have managed their budgets the old-fashioned way: slash, then beg. Lay off teachers. Freeze some wages.

General Motors' Lordstown Complex: By the time GM filed for bankruptcy on June 1, sales of the Chevrolet Cobalt small car had fallen so low that Lordstown was down to a single production shift after having run three shifts only a few months earlier.

Another strength is, of course, de la Renta himself. In many ways the current expansion is a well-thought-out plan to showcase and profit from almost every aspect of the designer's life. Redd says that the home line that launches this spring will be divided into categories called City, Island and Country, "the places where Oscar has his houses," and everything will be done with "an ODLR sensibility." De la Renta, who never misses the staff domino game in his Punta Cana kitchen, has insisted on a set of dominoes, for example.

Ray Ratto, CSN Bay Area: "To figure out the event that sparked the mayhem that defined the second game of this Western Conference quarterfinal is like finding the best piece of hay in a haystack. The San Jose Sharks and St. Louis Blues came to the rink loaded for bear, and came away with handfuls of fur. Of the game, which St. Louis won, 3-0, to tie the series at one skin apiece, this can be said. The Sharks started, and didn't finish. They didn't finish their chances, they didn't finish their work along the wall, they didn't . . . well, anything, really."

Somewhere in the 50,000 pages of documents related to the Saints bounty program better be some compelling evidence that it was much more organized and way more vicious than anything the NFL had ever seen. Otherwise, the punishment he's doled out already has exceeded the crime, and the commissioner's credibility on two of the signature issues of his tenure — player safety and the integrity of the games — will suffer a hit he can barely afford. Because if the players believe Goodell is more interested in burnishing his tough-guy reputation and insulating the league from further liability on safety concerns than he is in genuinely pursuing their best interests, look out. All the pushback from all the previous disciplinary cases combined will seem like a nudge.
“Campaign finance and ethics reform only works if it curtails all special interest groups equally and does not carve out any exceptions to benefit one party or another,” said Kean (R-Union) in a statement. “Pay to play reform was passed to limit the influence of big spending contractors over the public officials from whom they are trying to obtain work. That law missed one of the biggest recipients of public dollars and thus, must be fixed in the interest of fairness and honesty.”

Into this world step two strangers, Goldberg (Tony Papenfuss) and McCann (Martin Ruben). Papenfuss's Goldberg borrows a page from Joe Pesci, gliding about like a bellicose slug, a trail of slime in his wake. He jabs at Stanley, coddles Meg and abuses a local girl, Lulu (Katie Guentzel). Ruben is less certain, though his physical bulk makes McCann a worthy thug.
For example, the American Enterprise study says that job security adds an economic value of 10 percent to the employee. But it's an intangible, feel-good concept, not a matter of dollars and cents.
The first time I was pulled over in Oregon by the police was in 1992 for speeding. I didn't have a problem with it because I was guilty as charged. Paid the ticket while learning an expensive lesson. Later that year I was stopped in Southeast Portland for what the officer called "suspicious driving." No ticket. Just 20 minutes of running my information. I asked the officer what did I do that was suspicious but never got an answer -- just a "be careful out there" as he handed my papers back to me and walked back to his car.
The city was eventually cited for violations, the suit says. When Marsh and Schimmel learned that Wenz had been reporting to state and federal agencies, they fired him, the suit says.
Look for a New York-style delicatessen with a live-music venue attached, Creighton says. One of the dining rooms is being transformed into a venue for local and national entertainers, replete with a professional sound booth and a lighting system.
G-rated family films are about as common as a solar eclipse, so parents will be glad to know there is something "safe" for their kids to see (and at 78 minutes, relatively short for the more squiggly sitters). But parents should also be warned that there is some fighting between warring chimps and that the chimps hunt and eat monkeys as part of their regular food gathering. Eww.

Communication is key in any successful project, so let everyone on site know about the importance of the critical root zone. Most of the tree's roots are within 3 feet of the ground surface for access to air, water and nutrients, so avoid adding more soil on top of the protection zone.

Scott, a seven-time winner on the PGA Tour whose best finish at Firestone was a tie for ninth last year, hit 15 of 18 greens in regulation and needed just 23 putts in a bogey-free round to put the finishing touches on his ninth start on the South Course.

The law is scheduled to be implemented on June 30, after a 90-day waiting period. But that effective date is likely to be postponed while union groups across the state aided by Democrats launch a referendum that will be on this November's ballot. It would ask voters to overturn the law. If enough signatures are collected to place the referendum on the ballot, then the law could not become effective until voters make their decision in the fall.
Yet the problem remains that “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1” doesn’t really work as its own movie; it exists strictly to set us up for “Part 2,” arriving next year. So there’s a lot of exposition, a ton of flashbacks, some obvious padding and a cliff-hanger ending.

The agreement is a rare cause for fanfare at Yahoo. The company has struggled to grow advertising revenue in the last few years, amid competition from Google and Facebook. Though its news site is popular, Yahoo has been unable to rebound from a financial slump, even as its rivals have grown.

First, there are the complimentary rolls—big, steamy, fresh baked and yeast-smelling and honey-butter to spread them with—they are tender, and enough of a reason to go there. Mesquite-grilled steaks, prime rib and the combinations include the following: lettuce wedge or dinner salad, or cup of soup, and choice of baked sweet potato, (and they are big, and good, with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on them) baked potato, steak fries, steamed vegetables, or Texas rice.

Recalcitrant railroads are one thing. But when citizen gadflies get aggressive or sloppy, Diemert pushes back with equal force, firing off a sarcastic email or letter, some containing subtle threats of litigation.

The Race So Far: Hawkes and Renner have yet to win any major guild or critics’ prizes, so they’re pretty much non-starters. Bale won this category at SAG and the Golden Globes, giving him a definite edge — but there’s a contingent who found his acting over-the-top, and he has a bit of a cranky reputation. Nice-guy Ruffalo won the New York critics’ prize; BAFTA, which adored “The King’s Speech,” gave Rush its award. (L.A. reviewers went for Niels Arestrup from the French film, “A Prophet,” who isn’t a factor here.) Rush has won an Oscar before, though; Ruffalo’s work was solid but hardly astounding.

And when I said it was Jason, everyone was blown away by the beauty and soulfulness of his voice. Quincy Jones wanted to sign him on the spot."
But the improvement in test scores is not what has impressed me most. Rather, it's the dynamic energy I've felt every time I've walked into the building. It's the urgency I've seen in the actions of many teachers. It's the excitement I've heard in the voices of students on test day.

As the story goes, Roger Waters wrote "The Wall," "The Final Cut," and "The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking" all at once, and asked his band which of them they wanted to do. Pink Floyd chose "The Wall," and the rest is rock history. I would have voted for "The Final Cut," which helps explain why I'm not working for a record company. By the time the Floyd got around to "The Final Cut," Waters' ambition had effectively wrecked the band: ace pianist Rick Wright doesn't even play on the set. Floyd snobs who've who've slept on "The Final Cut" are missing out on "The Gunner's Dream," which is one of the greatest pieces of poetry ever written in British English vernacular. Yes, you read that right. You can keep your Shakespeare and your Wordsworth; they've never moved me the way "Gunner's Dream" does.

The only case in which I can see feminists offering even tepid support to a socially conservative female politician is in the extremely unlikely circumstances that her opponent is just as or nearly as conservative as she is, or if she offers an entire slate of Christianity-inspired social justice programs that would benefit women as a whole. Feminists are not incapable of holding their noses and voting for anti-abortion politicians who are firmly behind education and welfare programs to support families, anti-discrimination legislation and access to comprehensive sex education and contraception. But someone who believes in offering social support, much less offering women so many tools to empower themselves, is not really a social conservative at all. So again, we're at square one. It's categorically impossible to be both feminist and socially conservative.

They are lovers, but nobody knows, which is what Jason (Jacob Golliher) demands. Smart, good-looking and athletic, starring in a class production as Romeo, he's a prince among seniors.
The trick to growing your own is to give orchids conditions similar to that in their native habitats. That may sound daunting, but it's often not that difficult. Shade cloth, a pair of fans and a swamp cooler help provide the proper light, temperatures and air circulation the plants in Balchan's greenhouse need to thrive. Yet a surprising number will settle for good light from a window and comfortable temperatures in a home.
Besides, he said, there already are two nonprofit groups in Camden that have cooking schools. Both get funding from Campbell.
The other recipes I tried from the farm, including a chard strata and grilled Calcot onions served with a romesco-like hazelnut and garlic sauce, were all winners. And the broccoli, which I boiled and drizzled with olive oil, was among the sweetest and most tender I've had.
Abortion is a wedge for both parties (coat hangers in back alleys and so on). And don't forget Social Security. When any reform proposal is raised, Democrats scare Grandma by telling her the GOP wants to cut off her checks. President Obama did just that last summer during the debt limit debate. It was a scare tactic, but it worked.
With a week to go before the Jan. 31 Florida Republican presidential primary, the polls suggested a tight race, although Romney and his allies seized a staggering advantage in the television ad wars. They have reported spending $14 million combined on commercials, many of them critical of Gingrich, and a total at least seven times bigger that the investment made by the former House speaker and an organization supporting him.
"It's disgraceful to be a Democrat when you're young," said Boulder's Darren Kelly. "You have your whole future ahead of you. You don't need government to take care of you. Young people in particular need to think about their choice and not just get on the bandwagon."
"He was a leader emotionally and he played that way," Beathard said. "He was great to young kids. I just can't imagine this, because I've never seen Junior in a down frame of mind. He was always so upbeat and he would keep people up. He practiced the way he played. He made practice fun. He was a coach's dream."

The review commission also recommended that police have more oversight on large clubs and party promoters, which police said they are exploring.
Even an $899 Windows 8 tablet based on the latest Intel CPUs is intriguing. It's clear that tablets and notebooks are used in fundamentally-different ways. I can read a book on a notebook, but it's clumsy; ditto for the tablet which forces me to constantly take my hands off the keyboard to tap the screen. A new Windows tablet could flawlessly behave like either kind of machine, with the only drawback being the need to carry a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse for when you need the thing to act like a notebook computer and run desktop-style software.

Krejci injured the wrist in the first period of the team's 4-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers on Wednesday in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinal series.
"Talking About Detective Fiction" (Alfred A. Knopf: 204 pp., $22) should not be thought of as definitive, and P.D. James takes great pains to remind the reader not to read too deeply into her choices. It puzzled me, for example, that Josephine Tey garnered several pages of notice, but she was not included among the most pivotal of the Golden Age practitioners (James, instead, picked Christie, Allingham, Sayers and Marsh as her most deserving quartet), and when she was discussed, there was no mention of my own favorite book of Tey's, "Daughter of Time."
In short, the current all-appointed Baltimore County school board continued with its unapologetic, customary secrecy in dealings with the public. We must now all hope that Mr. Dance will be the "star" promised by Mr. Schmidt. Otherwise, we will know what group was responsible.

What does society do when one person's behavior puts the greater community at risk? We make them stop. We pass laws, or impose economic rules, or find some other way to discourage individual behaviors that threaten the greater common good. You don't get to drive drunk. You don't get to smoke in public places. You don't even get to leave your house if you catch some particularly infectious disease.
Arch Coal spokeswoman Kim Link declined to comment.
I recall wondering if seeing the world through the prism of movies had resulted in taking images for granted. And if that was the case, was that initial, constant loop of the twin towers on fire solidifying that, or shaking it up?
The high demand for U.S. dollars at the ECB auction Wednesday appeared to be more a case of bargain-hunting than of panic.

"We've been on the right edge of that fine line all year, and the last couple games we've been on the wrong edge of it," Hitchcock said after the team's skate Friday at the Lightning's practice rink. "We did a lot of really good things (in Carolina), but the one area that we're trying to get better at is our puck management. We got away with mistakes before and it didn't hurt us. Now, it seems to hurt us. When you play on the fine line like we are, the way you manage the puck goes a long way into how successful you are."

ARLINGTON, Va. -- Newt Gingrich's turbulent bid for the Republican presidential nomination ended Wednesday, closing a raucous chapter in the GOP race that saw the outspoken, often outrageous, former speaker of the House tumble rapidly from front-runner to also-ran.

Capcom's latest entry into the genre is a crossover pitting two of the biggest fighting game franchises against each other.

Said Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake: "We certainly need to improve our clearance rate, but it's also about training." It's not enough "to check it off and say it's cleared, but not have a solid case for the state's attorney to prosecute. We need to focus on our clearance rate but do it in a way that continues to promote safety, and not just safety, but the perception of safety — that there's a criminal justice system that works."
And after clearing his family's dinner table, Saro set out to test his hypothesis. He positioned aluminum foil in a glass beaker and filled it with artificially contaminated water. Saro placed a carpenter's pencil lead in the water, held in place by a homemade device.
Belgrader and his designer Anita Stewart make effective use of the venerable Harvey's artfully decayed decor. Framed by its tarnished proscenium, a relatively modest-scaled set is situated against the gloomily-lit expanse of the theater's rear stage and back wall, which suggests the post-nuclear holocaust wasteland of Beckett's 1957 play.

Super-packed most weekend days, this is a beach party on steroids during warm weather. With its large space, beach bum ambience and 150+ selection of beers, it's no wonder the parking lot is a zoo most days in the summer. Here's a tip, though: Park down the street in the public parking lot. Sure, you will have to pay, but it's only about 350 yards away and an easy walk. And you won't have to risk a dented fender as you try to negotiate the tight, narrow parking spaces of the Undertow lot. 3850 Gulf Blvd., St. Pete Beach, (727) 368-9000

The equally old-school “mushroom loaf,” a sort of veggie scrapple, was overspiced to compensate for its stick-to-your-ribs density, but also leavened by sweet pumpkin tortellini and adorably bitter baby turnips. The big pork loin with maple-pecan glaze was a bit bland, but I loved the zing of gingersnaps in the gravy, and the creamy spoon bread that was almost worth the dish itself. Fresh and snappy fiddleheads, minced stinging nettles, and a beautifully brick-colored Arctic char more or less compensated for the shame of cooking precious white asparagus to fibrous mush. Some overcooked Asian eggplants were an afterthought once I forked into the cuminy fava-bean pancake that framed a gorgeous rack of lamb from nearby Erdenheim Farms in Lafayette Hill.
Central bank officials in Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose convertible mark is currently pegged to the euro, could switch to whatever hard currency emerges in the case of a breakup of the euro, a spokeswoman said.

The piece Weschler wrote about their conversation, which opens "True to Life," was fashioned as a refutation, of sorts, of Irwin's thinking, which then led to another piece on Irwin refuting what Hockney had to say. This has been going on for 25 years. "It's not a personality conflict," Weschler says. "My experience is that these two very large, capacious, vital thinkers are basically having a fundamental argument about what both of them think of as the most important thing in the last 500 years, which is cubism -- an ongoing project. If you took it seriously, you would be doing what each of them is doing, and exactly not what the other one is doing. And yet, for all that, they are right on top of each other in terms of all sorts of issues." To make the point explicit, he closes the Irwin book with an afterword that leads directly into the preface of the Hockney book, as if he were building a bridge with words.

Many members of Congress recognize the excessive taxes, penalties, fees and service reductions coming down the line as the health care law is fully implemented. With bipartisan support, Congress has already repealed the small business reporting mandate known as the 1099 provision and has rescinded billions of dollars in proposed health slush funds. Likewise, the House will soon consider bipartisan legislation that would repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), one of more than 100 panels of unelected bureaucrats created by the health care law that will have the sole, unchecked power to make reductions in health care services based on costs, not treatments. While this is progress, the consequences of every provision within the 2,000-page law are still unknown.
There was just enough marble left over from the counter to top the bench seat in the shower, which is lined in three sizes of the same beige tiles with a band of decorative glass tiles running horizontally about head-height.

The key at Collins Lake is that the lake manager charges a day-use fee - $10 per vehicle during the week, $13 on weekends - and all visitors pass through an entrance kiosk. That money helps pay for a program where large trout are raised in 12 submerged net pens and then released in pulses throughout the year. An attendant at the entrance kiosk enforces the fees and employees provide oversight. That means people who might cause problems often go elsewhere.
This long-awaited demographic shift is largely attributed to the youngest children of post-World War II baby boomers finally making their way through high school. It's a population bubble that fueled a 36 percent increase in high school graduates nationwide from 1994 to 2008.

I also agree with Mary Ann Nihart's contention that, at this time, a public vote on the sales-tax would be a very chancy affair. Pacifica voters have been very reluctant lately to pass any additional revenues for a Council that has presided over years of financial failure. The last decade has been a litany of stalled development, lost opportunities, a never-ending debate over Hwy. 1 improvements, the bio-diesel fiasco, a neglected sewer system, costly city lawsuits, crumbling infrastructure, and a constantly shrinking bank account. Although the present recall effort seems like an impulsive, half-baked idea to me, I can easily understand the anger and frustration that motivates it. People are fed up. A tax-raising ballot measure right now wouldn't have a snowball's chance in hell.

Their first year has been crowded with events.

Baum’s defense attorney, John Iaciofano, has filed a motion to suppress Baum’s statement to police, on the grounds that Baum was so intoxicated he could not have knowingly waived his Miranda right to remain silent.

The longer it takes to regain the national capacity to launch people and equipment into space independently, the more troubling the scientific and national security implications become for the United States.
