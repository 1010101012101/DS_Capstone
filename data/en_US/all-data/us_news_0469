And that's the thing. There are no rules about passengers having to fit into the economy-class seats. The closest the Federal Aviation Administration comes to addressing this issue is when it issues its guidance on passengers with disabilities, but it doesn't specifically classify a passenger's weight or size as a disability that is in need of protection. If it did, airlines would probably have to give every tall guy like me a first-class seat, which, now that I think about it, wouldn't be so bad.

His one shining consolation, especially in the case of losing his heir, was the presence of the spare, Henry, duke of York.

This is an HBO drama, not an NBC comedy, and there’s some work involved, but the producers shouldn’t make it too hard or they’ll lose their audience before they can set the hook. David Milch, the creator of “Luck” and “Deadwood,” is infamous for dictating dialogue and rewriting constantly. His work on “Deadwood” was a combination of ornate and profane, long speeches and soliloquies that were unlike anything ever heard on TV, before or since. His fans declared him a genius, the Shakespeare of the small screen, and hailed “Deadwood” as the best western series ever at the same time “The Wire” was being called the best cop show ever and “The Sopranos” the greatest involving neurotic suburban gangsters from northern New Jersey.

But after her sister's death she felt keenly the importance of living fully. She quotes critic Cyril Connolly: "words are alive and literature becomes an escape, not from, but into living." She begins with "The Elegance of the Hedgehog" and keeps on going, reading 70 pages an hour (roughly four hours to read a book) and then writing a review on her website for 365 days. The beauty of her project, for this reader, lies in seeing how books intertwine with daily life, how very much they affect our moods, interactions, and, especially important for Sankovitch, how we recover and process our memories. Sankovitch is not a smarty-pants. Her reviews have an easy, conversational style that is different from the work of so many critics. There is more emphasis on how books make a reader feel than on where they fit in the great canon or how much you have to know to approach the great books. She makes reading seem accessible, relaxing, inspiring, fun.

As if that wasn't enough testing to think about, we recently had to write a $200 check for AP testing as well, both to try to get college credit and to bulk up my college application.

My favorite part is near the end of the course: a 630-foot stretch — longer than two football fields — of nonstop zipping.

Hales: Oh, it's important and important on so many levels. First, with respect to our kids. The Parks Bureau is a big player in making the arts accessible to kids and families in Portland. The summer programs, the afterschool programs, the community center programs, they go on and on. And they should. They shouldn't be the first thing cut. They should be a core part of the Parks Bureau curriculum and program, because arts are part of recreation. In fact, that part of the city budget is called "Parks, Recreation and Culture."

Back to the Limbaugh apology. I have known Rush for some years (he wrote a forward to one of my books), and I think I can tell when he is sincere.

Assigning blame to politicians appeared to work for Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections, just as it did for Bill Clinton, a Democrat, when he ran for president in 1992. And if the current economic recovery isn’t robust enough, it could be a political liability in 2012, too.

I had the privilege last week to give a keynote address at the 2010 Cleveland Clinic Medical Innovation Summit. It was inspiring to be in the midst of so many health care leaders.

Meanwhile, back in the offense, when the Broncos moved to an option-based offense because Tim Tebow was the team's starter at quarterback, the team's tight ends largely became ornamental in the passing game no matter who they were. With just 19 catches, Daniel Fells led the team's tight ends in receptions.
Intelligence analysts have been reviewing and translating the material, looking for information about pending plots and other terror connections.

Ashley Manning, who graduated from the University of Virginia with a finance degree, is wife of the quarterback, mother of his children. She grew up in Tennessee.

"I think the building is so beautiful and state-of-the art that our customers will love to come and visit."
Child rearing is filled with numerous moments of abject horror. From the moment when they handed me my first child and I couldn't stop thinking I was going to drop him to major media reminding me daily that my children are about to be kidnapped by terrorists and made to do Un-American things in foreign lands, every moment is another second where I'm sure I or society at large is going to kill the kids. I'm a nervous wreck. And the kids aren't helping.

Coach Nate McMillan, who throughout his tenure in Portland has used a deep roster to spread minutes around, played just eight players during the Blazers' 86-83 win over the Nuggets Thursday night. One game earlier, during a win at Memphis, he used nine and one player -- seldom used reserve Sean Marks -- played less than seven minutes.

There was power and sweep in the opening movement, a crisp sense of swagger in the subsequent "Game of Couples," and a buoyant rhythmic wit in the "Interrupted Intermezzo." Dutoit and the orchestra collaborated to give the finale an exuberant sense of release.
"I just try to say no, I'll buy my own," she said. "That's my motto. I'll buy my own coffee."
The White House has couched its attacks in the language of "disclosure" and the argument that corporations should not have the same speech rights as individuals. But now, says Rory Cooper of the Heritage Foundation, "he's doing the same at the individual level, for anyone who opposes his policies." Any giver, at any level, risks reprisal from the president of the United States.

As for the utter surprise of the plant closing - it turned up in Chrysler's bankruptcy filing after the auto company and Obama announced that the bankrupcty would cause no long-term harm -- Procop said there was little discussion.
But even the most detailed, exhaustive set of rules can't envision every possible situation, as the Hathaway Brown case shows: Of course there's no exception in Bylaw 4 for a student who spends one semester rehabbing an injury out of state while maintaining her enrollment at her Ohio high school. How often does such a thing happen?

The Republican kids get the clues. Hours after a 21-year-old Idaho man was arrested for shooting an AK-47 rifle at the White House, the president of the University of Texas College Republicans tweeted: "Y'all as tempting as it may be, don't shoot Obama. We need him to go down in history as the WORST president we've EVER had!" Her successor apparently wasn't chastened by the ensuing furor, tweeting, "My president's black, he snorts a lot of crack."
"It's a glorious place to work, and I've had a lot of fun," said Camp, an avid outdoorsman who canoes, fishes and swims in the river. But with a home in Santa Fe, N.M., and a golf getaway in Wisconsin, Camp has decided to downsize. "I'm just trying to normalize my life and get ready for the last 20 years or whatever I've got," he said. "It's a lot to take care of."
George Karl lost to the Lakers in the 2009 Western Conference finals with a team pretty much completely different from this one. The seventh-winningest coach in NBA history, Karl has amassed 1,073 career victories in his 23-plus seasons in the NBA, including a streak of 20 consecutive non-losing seasons — trailing only Phil Jackson's 21.

In the city, people who use the data sometimes complain that it is not updated consistently enough. The Sun has found that in some cases information about city contracts is incomplete. And in investigations of city property tax credits, reporters have found that the information in OpenBaltimore only provides owners’ initial tab — not what they’re paying after tax breaks.
Eric Kahn and Rubin Sinins, lawyers for the plaintiffs, used the same collection of tickets to show that out of 1,090 times Lopes played, he spent only $12 on 12 numbers the day of the jackpot, an indication he was playing for the pool, which always bought 12 numbers.
But the dismissive nature of Steinbeck's modern grudge-holders still puzzles his advocates. The much-promoted centennial celebration of his birth 10 years ago attracted scant notice east of the Mississippi, said Susan Shillinglaw, director of the Center for Steinbeck Studies at San Jose State University.
On Wednesday, April 18, a group of Belvidere High School students hosted a Senior Activity Day for local senior citizens from the Chelsea at Brookefield in Belvidere.

Another audit by the inspector general that was completed in the spring but never made public questioned billing claims concerning the running of group homes for people with mental illness.
Back then, every student had a one-time chance to consolidate and permanently fix the rate on all their loans. As rates dropped, many students took advantage of this deal - locking in lower rates for a lifetime. But then this good deal was changed in 2006 - just in time to prevent students from taking advantage of the lowest interest rates in history. Repayment rates were fixed, giving us today's 6.8 percent repayment rate on Stafford loans.
"While we weren't able to win our last game, which is always the goal, it was good to see some recognition for the guys that had really worked so hard throughout the year," Wentzville lacrosse coach Chris Benton said. "Brad did a little bit of everything. He was one of our leaders in the midfield. To be our leading goal scorer was really important. For a team that struggled to score, especially in the early part of the year, to have a player score 30 goals in a matter of 15 games is a good year."
America and Israel are facing “a series of difficult months, I suspect, in 2012,” Obama said yesterday.

Armstrong says, "This is our team," and despite not making any moves at the deadline, the general manager said he's happy with the club, which entered Monday's game with the fourth-most points in the NHL (83).
I'll play psychologist here for a second. It seems that Arrieta, who was overpowering up to that point, lost focus after he threw away a pickoff throw for the second time in the game. He went from dominating the heart of the Angels explosive lineup to walking the No. 7 and No. 9 hitters to set a five-run inning in motion. He pitched to nine batters in the fifth and got just one out after retiring 12 consecutive batters.

Like canaries in coal mines, they are harbingers of worse things to come. For Fonda, they represent "not only a reflection of the lending crisis but also a comment on our rampant consumerism and the utter disposability of what we produce and what we buy."
Excerpt: The leading candidate for Oregon is expected to be Chris Petersen, the Boise State coach who has turned away dozens of head coaching opportunities while compiling a 73-6 record over the past six seasons. ... It will be interesting to see how Petersen or any other high-profile candidates — Tony Dungy’s son is an Oregon player — deal with the specter of the NCAA investigation. ... Its mere existence will create a stigma, especially if Oregon fails to immediately land a high-caliber coach.

Cal is led by do-everything floor leader Jorge Gutierrez, the physical Harper Kamp inside and two guys who can kill from the outside in Allen Crabbe and Justin Cobbs. The Bears are well-coached and experienced enough to lessen a home-court advantage.
An unspeakable crime.
Albright, also Washington state associate climatologist, said older snowpack data showed little decrease over the years, and accused Mote of exaggerating by starting with the high snowfall 1950s.
The Bulls' defense was also stellar, limiting the Sixers to 31.8-percent shooting in the second quarter and 37-percent shooting in the half. Philadelphia guards Holiday, Turner and Lou Williams were a combined 4-for-28.

Other companies standing to lose include Netflix, which offers monthly pricing plans for unlimited DVDs by mail, sent one disc or two at a time. Longer delivery times would mean fewer opportunities to receive discs each month, effectively a price increase. Netflix in recent months has been vigorously promoting its video streaming service as an alternative.
The safety-net health system, with help from state regulators, recently submitted a proposal to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid that would allow MetroHealth to create a special Medicaid program for low-income people who aren't currently eligible for the federal health insurance program for the poor.

��Dark blue 1990s Toyota Corolla.
There wasn't a drop of liquor at Jessica Nicholson's party at the Bar Method in Washington three weeks prior to her November wedding. Surprised? So were a few of the 33-year-old's friends, who didn't realize that the name of the establishment referred to a ballet barre workout. If you walk out stumbling, it's because your thighs are still shaking from the intense toning exercises.
McCoy also bruised his left, non-throwing hand on the play. The medical staff appeared to be spending much of the three minutes, 50 seconds that followed McCoy's leveling by Harrison looking at the hand.

The Bible is our truth. Christ reminds us of this in John 17:17 where he said about our heavenly Father's Word, "Your word is truth." We will find no error within the Bible. There are no loopholes in it, as hard as one may try to find some.

On playing guard: "I feel good about it. When I first got into the league, I was kind of a swing guy, a reserve. I've had work there. I spent 2008 there (with the Indianapolis Colts), so I'm good with it."
“We expected a tight game. We came out and played well defensively -- we knew we had to -- and eventually we took the game over and won it in the third.”
Then we climbed over an orange mountain range and entered a landscape of textured sand, lunar craters and hoodoo rocks. We were in the Catarpe Valley of the Salt Mountain Range, just a few miles outside the relative oasis of San Pedro (it has a trickle of a river running through), at the Alto Atacama.
As a homespun war machine assembled by workers who likely had never built a ship before, the CSS Georgia represents the South's lack of an industrial base, Johnston said. The North, by contrast, was teeming with both factories and laborers skilled at shipbuilding. They churned out a superior naval fleet that enabled the Union to successfully cut off waterways used to supply Confederate forces.
_ Worst-case outcome: Greece's new leaders are unable to find common ground with international lenders. The IMF pulls the plug on future bailouts and richer European nations refuse to step in. Greece defaults and leaves the euro currency or is expelled. There is panic among holders of bonds issued by other financially troubled countries, creating a cascade of defaults and requiring more bailouts.
“I caught him,’’ beamed Williams.

Will insurance costs be lower in the exchange and rise at slower rates?
Centrowitz said the race in Paris, his first on that kind of stage, was "more nerve-wracking than any race I've been in, in a long, long time. It didn't really hit until we put our stuff in the basket and started doing last-minute strides. I was looking around and seeing all of these really fast guys. For a split-second I just didn't think I was ready for it. I had to wake up and realize I was racing just another race and relax a little bit."
And the steaks: Not prime meats, but corn-fed beef aged for more intense flavor (the consequence of less water); the kitchen nearly infallible with cooking it as ordered. Delmonico, filet mignon and chateaubriand (prices vary by thickness and size) were all sexy in their own ways, texture and flavor needing a minimum of lily-gilding. Still, gild Bern's does, which is why the steak menu (as opposed to the nightly Kitchen within a Kitchen a la carte menu) is still a relative bargain. In a metro area increasingly crowded with $40 steak houses where everything's a la carte, Bern's steadfastly offers an inclusive menu.
Troyer said the sheriff's office was disappointed that the initial operator left the impression that help wasn't immediately on the way.
Ross, 56, lives in Toronto and Kathryn, 53, lives in New York. She calls herself a "typical English major" who received honorable mention for New York University's Thomas Wolfe Memorial Poetry Award.

Don't believe it? Go to the store and pick up a six-pack of a good, aromatic beer - maybe an American pale ale or a big Belgian ale. Take a sip of one from the bottle. Then pour one beer into a glass and compare.
Nor did the story say who was employing him or whether he is getting government benefits. Isn't that illegal? And who pays for any accidents he may be involved in?
He made his presentation, told the new boss where and why he'd over-spent -- mostly to make the Grand Cherokee's interior look and feel ritzy and inviting -- and waited for the ax to fall. Another executive at the table began rattling off what features they could drop, where they could scrimp to get back on track.
Rupert Murdoch jettisoned the notorious News of the World tabloid in an effort to protect his media empire. But the dramatic step may prove insufficient to contain the growing scandal or secure his bid to expand an already-massive presence in Britain.

They had a right to be. Coming right after the straightforwardly spooky “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark” (and the purely adult shivers of “Take Shelter”), “Dream House” isn’t so much a nightmare as just a sort of nodding distraction.

For architect Jeanne Gang, a 2011 MacArthur Fellow, connecting to the surroundings in Chicago means using lots of concrete, iron and steel. "Chicago has a rough climate. You need resilience to the outside," says Ms. Gang. One of her goals is to take those heavy materials and make them feel lighter by bending them and creating delicate-looking surfaces.
Brian Newberry, president and founder of Plastic Cash, said the cards are marketed to teens, and it makes sense to use card images they'd relate to. The cards are geared at consumers as young as 13, Newberry said.
As the son of a professor, he grew up at the university, he said, attending football games, prepping for debates in the library and taking summer jobs around campus. His personal connections to Willamette attracted him to the job, he said, but the school's reputation was also an important draw.
The state could also merge other tests, he added, like making the community college entrance exam and high school graduate test one and the same. Cerf also said the state could eliminate the high school proficiency test and just require students to take tests based on individual subjects, such as New York’s regents exams.
Reactively, technicians respond to alerts that beep on their screens 70 or 80 times a day. These show up as red dots circled in black and are triggered, for example, when someone slips their zone, tampers with the bracelet, or doesn't charge the battery.
34: In 2004, Mitch Daniels ran a nearly flawless campaign for governor. In the primary, he had the support of almost every powerful Republican in the state, and he energized both party insiders and political newbies. He raised money with ease, made few mistakes and was easily the most electable Republican in the race. Still, his opponent, conservative activist Eric Miller, won 34 percent of the vote. To some, that figure serves as a baseline of the anti-establishment, far-right vote in a GOP primary. If that's true, that's a pretty good start for a challenger.
From Bloomington, Ill., came the weather report: "Light breeze and perfect."
Sacramento County originally was part of the civil lawsuit, but settled its portion in 2009 with a payment of $488,000 and the development of elaborate policies for tagging and storing items seized during sweeps of illegal campsites.
Under a proposal from County Executive Kevin Kamenetz's office, the county would contract with two firms to pursue a lawsuit: Scott, Douglass & McConnico LLP, which is based in Austin, Texas, and Themis PLLC, which has locations in Washington, D.C., and Chevy Chase.

McQueary testified in a grand jury investigation that he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky sodomize a 10-year-old boy in the Penn State football showers in 2002. He reported what he saw to coach Joe Paterno the next day, but did not alert law enforcement officials.
Nunn wouldn’t say which game or which quarterback, only clarifying it wasn’t in the postseason.
"Hopefully, by improving the ability to communicate throughout the organization, they're going to win more games, so we're going to take credit for a lot of those," Paulsen joked.
A short time later police pulled over a green Dodge Caravan with four people in it. Officers stopped the vehicle because the person who'd called about the noise reported seeing a green minivan leave the area.
You could argue the condensed season is the real fertile ground from which such a story could spring. NBA teams are critically short on practice time with more games crammed into each week. Game-planning for a particular opponent is in decline. The undisciplined play, injuries and tired efforts make for exactly the kind of season that needs the fun Jeremy Lin has brought to one of the NBA's biggest and most important markets.
At the time, a repository at Yucca Mountain was still in the works.
IndyCar's return to Long Beach ran into turmoil Thursday before the drivers had even taken their first practice laps on the city's seaside streets.

Similarly, Dayton said he did not consider the Farmers Market site to be in contention. The Metrodome, the team's home for 30 years, remains a fallback site, Dayton said, but lacks the economic development potential of Linden Avenue.
A Republican Party whose primary and caucus voters have been so reluctant to rally around Mr. Romney -- and so willing to back a tainted challenger like Mr. Gingrich or a narrow ideologue like Mr. Santorum to block or just slow his slog to the nomination -- could be unable to arouse itself sufficiently to elect him in November.

So, I want someone who can communicate and continue that level of trust.
