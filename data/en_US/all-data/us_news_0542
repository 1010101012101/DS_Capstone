This rating would be higher if the restaurant had not scaled back its menu only months after remodeling  and reinventing  the place. This could be a fine dining extravaganza, complete with grand ideas, show-stopping techniques and, most of all, stellar results.

For example, in a worship service the worshipers offer flowers, fragrance, fruits, sweets and other food articles to the deity.

The food offered to God, called Prasad, becomes holy, which is distributed to the worshipers after the service.

Now to the Martins. I could see the Giants taking Jonathan, given the scouting reports saying he has good feet but needs to get stronger and more physical. That’s the kind of description that fits tackles Reese has drafted in the past with Guy Whimper, Will Beatty and James Brewer -- athletic players who need to fill out and refine their technique.

Other factors complicate the psychological testing of soldiers. Psychiatrists at Madigan Army Medical Center in Washington state -- located on Bales' home base -- may have changed PTSD diagnoses to save money. Meanwhile, the murky background of new recruits -- some who have mental illness, have been on medication and had concussions we don't know about -- complicates assessment.

There are no good tools to discern predisposition to emotional stress or assess for a history of concussions.

Note: A South American favorite that originated in Peru, ceviche combines fresh raw fish or seafood with citrus juices to "cook" the fish over a long marinating period of up to several hours; that is, the acid in the juices alters the proteins in the fish, turning it opaque as if it were cooked. Citrus juices do not kill bacteria to the same extent that heat does, so it is safest to use cooked or partially cooked fish and marinate for a shorter period. This recipe calls for flash-cooking shrimp in boiling water before adding it to the citrus mixture.

He didn't have to do much to get what he wanted, but there was always something he did. His readings were manicured, seamless, architecturally solid.

It is progress of a kind that the nuclear disarmament movement is headed today by such establishment figures as Shultz, Henry Kissinger, William Perry and Sam Nunn. This "Gang of Four" elder statesmen have for the past five years authored sober op-ed columns calling for the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons and given a more realistic cast to a cause once dominated by the street theater and emotionalism of pacifist movements of the Cold War era.

"From a coach's standpoint, I would have loved to have both here," Thonn said. "We didn't want to lose Kurt, because he's young and developing. He's going to be very good. But if John wanted to play, it was important to bring him back. John is still a very good player."
Hayward, 53, who has a Ph.D in geology, had been a well-regarded chief executive. But his promise when he took the job in 2007 to focus on safety "like a laser" came back to haunt him after an April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig killed 11 workers and unleashed a deep-sea gusher of oil.
Similarly, in Tunisia thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in January to denounce violence committed by ultraconservative Islamist groups after a long-oppressed moderate Islamic party, Ennahda, swept elections last year and formed a government with two secular parties. Since then Ennahda has repeatedly sought to calm fears it would turn the country into an Islamic state.

Instructions: Remove giblet bag from turkey, along with any extra internal fat and pin feathers. Rinse well under cold tap water. Combine sugar, salt and 3-4 quarts of water in a large bowl. Stir until sugar and salt dissolve. Add remaining brine ingredients except for the remaining 1 1/2-1 3/4 gallons water. Double-bag two heavy-duty, unscented trash bags (not made of recycled materials), then put them in an ice chest that is large enough to hold the turkey. Place turkey in bags, pour in brine and remaining 1 1/2-1 3/4 gallons water -- there should be enough liquid to completely cover the bird. Press out air in bags; tightly close each bag separately. Keep turkey cold by piling bags of ice over and around the closed bags which will also help keep the turkey submerged. Brine for 12-24 hours.
The film's twist is served up in the title, the big-ticket item of the Rosemoor Animal Park, renamed from Mee's original and moved from Britain to Crowe's stomping ground of Southern California. Otherwise the screenplay, adapted by Aline Brosh McKenna and Crowe from Mee's book, follows along a pretty predictable path — there are obstacles to overcome and in the process family ties are tested. After a brief setup, the film dives right into the disastrous state of things at the zoo. Bringing things up to standard seems impossible; so is giving up. Even the truculent Dylan finds it hard to resist the animal magnetism of the lions and tigers and bears.
“The passage of county reform was supposed to herald in a new era of government different from ‘politics as usual,’ Hardiman added, “but nearly every facet of the transition process continues to be compromised by the same problems that plagued previous administrations.”

In the regular season, it's first team to score wins, unless a full quarter is played with no score. Then the game is a tie.
All palms require soil that has good drainage. Make sure you are growing your palm in a pot with drainage holes. Personally, I prefer clay pots to plastic for growing plants that should be allowed to dry out somewhat between waterings. Palms like ample water from spring through summer but prefer drier conditions from fall through winter. Keep the soil barely moist at this time. Never let the soil become bone dry. Always discard any drain water that collects in the saucer beneath the pot, as soggy soil promotes root rot.
Specialty retailers reported a mixed bag of results. The best-performing sector was specialty apparel, while the worst segment was drugstores, according to Retail Metrics. The biggest same-store gain was teen retailer Zumiez. And the worst comp-store gain? Teen retailer Wet Seal, which saw sales of tops and jewelry sag.

No cameras were permitted by the campaign staff to film Romney on the plane, and reporters were prohibited from reporting much of what he said as a condition for getting access to him—as is often standard during presidential campaigns. The difference was plain: He told personal stories, spoke more slowly and cracked easy jokes when he knew it wouldn't be used in stories.

And it's nonstop.
Let's cut to the crucial question: How is the new girl in David Fincher's version of "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo"? She's fine, thank you very much. That is to say, Rooney Mara looks just as bizarre as Noomi Rapace did in the role of Lisbeth Salander, the poster girl for punk and spunk in the Swedish-language trilogy. And she cuts just as striking a figure riding a motorcycle, surfing the web or taking and giving terrible punishment. But there's a crucial difference. Lisbeth 1 was black-light incandescence, burning with focused anger. Lisbeth 2 is recessive, haunted, sometimes bummed and occasionally blank but clearly alienated from the vile world in which Lisbeth 1 fiercely claimed her place. That may leave fans of the original feeling alienated too, not only from Lisbeth but from the spectacle of a remake that has much to recommend it—high-end craftsmanship, a singular heroine, a labyrinthine mystery, an intriguing milieu—yet lacks a vital spark.
"Took who?" she said he responded.
Bin Laden continued to order that holy war be waged thousands of miles away, even as he remained within his compound. He could only see the world in shadows, flickering on his television set and computer screen, described to him through letters and Arabic translations of American news reports.

Adrienne Martin's parents - Christine Trampler, of Ozark, Mo., and George "Larry" Eby of Springfield, Mo. - seek to join Martin's 9-year old son in pressing Busch for damages. It would give them greater control over legal strategy and a $1.5 million settlement offer.
But Selepouchin's most significant accomplishment is less tangible. She has become so strongly identified with her aesthetic - annotated line drawings of everyday objects like pots and pans, sushi rolls, microscopes, Holga cameras, and Tastykakes - that any diagram-style work not made by her is bound to evoke a flurry of e-mails from friends in the handmade community, outraged on her behalf. After six years, Selepouchin has branded the nerdy, charming diagram a Girls Can Tell product.
"Words can't describe how much we miss him," she said, before breaking into tears.

Always a night of pure delight.
The chance to vote early on hot-button issues like gambling and government reform was part of the reason people increasingly opted for absentee ballots, said Cuyahoga County Board of Elections director Jane Platten. A 2006 change in Ohio law allows anyone to cast an absentee ballot without giving a reason. The switch has prompted some election officials to begin referring to the ballots as "early voting" or "vote-by-mail."

Extensive searches at the time uncovered nothing, and many historians are convinced the pair crashed into the ocean. In addition, conspiracy theories, including claims that Earhart and Noonan were U.S. government agents captured by the Japanese before the World War II, still abound despite having been largely debunked.
When the calendar flips to January, it's off to his last stop, the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. Post-Sundance, the Cleveland festival quickly takes shape. Guentzler's office is dominated by Bill's Big Board, a gray stretch of wall crammed with color-coded cards representing Spanish films, Pan-African films, environmental films, Israeli films and on and on. The ever-changing puzzle evolves into an Excel spreadsheet, which will become the master schedule.

A 2009 Bee investigation found Hince was one of at least 68 individuals out of 969 CPS workers at the time with a criminal record. Savage said Hince made it clear that CPS knew of her convictions for welfare fraud  one while she worked at the agency. However, the judge said, Hince testified her convictions did not become a problem for her until they were reported in The Bee.

"Looking out for number one and my team all day long, trying to do whatever I can to put myself in position to win the race, that is really what I feel like I have been doing all my life," he said. "To do anything different just doesn't feel comfortable. It feels odd to me."
But the big day goes off nicely. The wedding is beautiful, the setting - the Cullen's property -- gorgeous. Jacob (Lautner) shows up as a friendly gesture, to bid Bella farewell on her last night as a human, before Edward turns her into a vampire.
Oregon for one simple reason: they do the jobs U.S. citizens don’t want. Not every Oregonian can get rich developing sales training programs for sports executives. Some have to pick the lettuce we eat. And anyone who says they hate farm workers clearly doesn’t have any idea what the price of groceries would be without them. Remember that the next time you or your parents try to stretch your Social Security check (which, by the way, undocumented workers pay taxes into without ever having the hope of getting anything back). Oregon’s economy would lose $3.4 billion if unauthorized workers were removed.
The Blues, meanwhile, limited the repercussions of their high penalty count by doing a exceptional job of killing opponents' power play. From the time Hitchcock took over on Nov. 8 until the end of the regular season, St. Louis ranked 2nd in the league with a PK success rate of 88 percent. They'll have to keep that up; San Jose is terrific on the power play. The Sharks had the No. 2 PP success rate (21.1 %) during the regular season.

Kasich recited jobs statistics — nearly 83,000 jobs created or retained in Ohio this year — several times during the two-hour briefing.
At USC law school, he is training the next generation of child interviewers. During a recent class, his students showed tapes of their practice interviews about Christmas celebrations, using Lyon's techniques. In one, a 9-year-old says his mother made holiday doughnuts and told him to eat just one. Unprompted, he confesses to snagging a second. "I got a little sneaky," he says, smiling.
"I am very happy," he said. "When I heard he was coming to Paterson, I was hoping he'd come here, and it happened.''
In counterpoint, however, House Republicans want Kasich to ask for the legislature's permission before he banks any state budget surplus into Ohio's rainy-day fund. Under current law, any surplus is automatically banked to keep it from the legislature's spenders.
This year's legislative initiative is much like one defeated last year. It would stack nominating committees with gubernatorial appointees and subject them to partisan tests in the state Senate. Merit selection further would be diluted by requirements that the governor receive panels of five candidates rather than three.
Cash tolls on the George Washington Bridge, Holland Tunnel, Lincoln Tunnel, Goethals Bridge, Bayonne Bride and Outerbridge Crossing rose from $8 to $12 on Sunday morning. And peak-hour tolls for users of the E-ZPass electronic payment system went from $8 to $9.50.

She admits that she is only beginning to understand what her students' lives are like, even with the essays. The statistics  such as the 80 percent of her students who live below the poverty line  don't tell half the story.

Officials at the Cleveland Fed, including Pianalto, support production of the videos as a means of educating people, Morgano said. But some of the views expressed, such as ways to reform banking in the first video, may be those of Fed researchers and may not necessarily be shared by Pianalto.

How that uptick in foreclosure notices will affect the market is unclear. Blomquist said that about half of all homeowners who receive notices end up going into foreclosure and their houses are sold at auction.

"Those like Westminster believe that excellence in all that they do is part of a being a Christian," he said.
The military's future role is often framed in the context of Turkey, where the Islamist-dominated government has curtailed the reach of the once-unassailable Turkish army. The more drastic flip-side scenario is thatEgypt's military, fearful of infringement, veers more toward the Pakistani army, never bashful about sidelining the country's elected officials in moments of crises.
It was 2003 when Curtis kissed the Claret Jug at Royal St. George’s with a square jawline and closely cropped black hair. This time, he was handed a pair of cowboy boots, smiling with a rounder face and a better appreciation of the journey.

The whole time, I did manage to hold onto my mallet, but I didn't make a goal -- that is, until the game was over. After each goal is scored, the scoring team must retreat behind its goal. Once the scored-on team makes it back to center court, the game resumes. Things were moving so quickly, I struggled to make it back to the goal in time.

In suburban Philadelphia, Occupy protester Nathan I. Kleinman is running a write-in campaign for Congress against four-term Rep. Allyson Schwartz in the Democratic primary on April 24. The 29-year-old said he never would have mounted a run without his Occupy experience. Kleinman withdrew from the ballot after a court hearing in which Schwartz's supporters questioned some of the 1,500 required signatures he had gathered to appear on the ballot.

Quick hits: Republicans think they have found their guy to challenge first-term Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana. Rep. Denny Rehberg, who's held the Big Sky State's sole House seat since 2000, is expected to announce today. Montana television station owners are rejoicing. . . . By itself, U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson's ruling that the new health care law is unconstitutional won't do much. This issue is headed for the Supreme Court and very possibly to whichever way Justice Anthony Kennedy is swinging at the moment. Kennedy's been part of majorities that interpret the Commerce Clause broadly and others that interpret it narrowly. For what it's worth, Vinson's decision is being touted by some on the left as evidence that the insurance mandate won't fly and they need to revive talk of a single-payer option. . . .

The owners would tell you that Pratt Street really comes alive on convention weekends, or when there's a big sporting event a few doors down at Camden Yards or M&T Bank Stadium — or at events such as this weekend's Real Ale Festival.

But despite the council's brusque treatment of Bressler, another report on abatements issued last month by the state not only bolsters NJPP's conclusions but claims Jersey City is losing out on collecting nearly $120 million in property taxes from abated properties.

Later in the year, The PD would send its own "special correspondent" to Gettysburg for the dedication of the national cemetery. Alas, in the days afterward, the paper would be forced to run telegraphic accounts from other papers instead -- ignoring Lincoln's short speech, focusing on the oration of Edward Everett Horton -- until, about a week later, its correspondent's telegram straggled in, unaccountably delayed. Perhaps that reporter was wise enough to see the merit in what would become known as the Gettysburg Address ... but we'll never know, because the PD said that the delay in receiving the account had rendered much of it pointless to print, and it ran only a few paragraphs skipping all the speeches.

Todd Ziebarth, vice president for state advocacy at the National Alliance, said that while environmental schools have existed for some time, he’s seen an increase in "themed" charters such as dual language schools.

Coleman had money problems -- he filed for bankruptcy in 1999, and made headlines when it was revealed he was working as a security guard. (In fact, he was arrested when he punched a woman who had approached him for an autograph while he was shopping for a bulletproof vest.)

Though he had been out of Hollywood for years, he did make guest appearances here and there, and even ran for governor of California during the infamous 2003 recall (he placed eight).

“You wanted a hit?”, sings James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, a little petulantly. “Well, that’s not what we do.” Could have fooled us. What was “All My Friends,” that two-chord piano-disco stomper that throbbed from the speakers of a thousand city bars and clubs in 2007? Nothing on “This Is Happening” is as immediate (although “Drunk Girls” comes close), so devotees of instant gratification will call the album inferior to “Sound Of Silver.” Don’t believe them. Murphy’s synthscapes never have been as wild or rich as they are here. This Princeton-born conqueror of the Big Apple demimonde remains a good Jersey kid at heart — suspicious of authority and popularity contests, and hostile to thoughtless anti-Americanism.
