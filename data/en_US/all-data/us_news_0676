"Let us amend our bail laws to allow judges to consider the factor of dangerousness to our communities before we release a violent person back on to the street to maim or kill while they await trial. This, too, is just simple common sense."
The problem that often hamstrings police and prosecutors is that there are often no witnesses. Two people meet in the dark, one of them kills the other, and the narrative of what happened solely belongs to the person interested in staying out of jail, the analysis shows.

Texting is also immediate. Most people see texts faster than they see email or pick up their voice messages. And they expect a reply right away, according to Dr. Turkle, who has researched this. When we send a text, we expect a reply in three minutes, she says. If we haven't received one in five minutes, we get antsy. "And if we still haven't heard back in 10 minutes, we believe something is wrong, that we are being ignored," says Dr. Turkle, author of "Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other."

For me, I had an opportunity to eat at both restaurants on that last episode, (and) based purely on the dinners I ate, Sarah was robbed. I think there would have been a backlash if Paul didn't win.

“From my perspective, there is still an untapped that doesn’t come across because of the long border waits,” he said.
Some estimates put more than 800 billion barrels of untapped oil in onshore and offshore reserves in the United States. Putting even a fraction of that on the market would help increase supply and impact the price of crude oil and thus the price at the pump. It would signal a future of greater supply to meet demand with America helping to lead the way. In addition, we need to look at new ways to secure oil from our allies rather than relying so heavily on unstable and unfriendly countries.

It is more than disappointing that the major news media has not yet covered the actions and leaders of this small but wonderful newspaper. I for one want to know more about Sara Ganim. What did she know and when did she know it?
For you as a seller, the disclosure statement is your best defense against legal action resulting from any problems your buyers may encounter in the years ahead. As I said earlier, you can only be expected to disclose what you know about, and you cannot guarantee things will not break in the days or months after your buyer moves in. While it is not an assurance that you will not get drawn into litigation, the disclosure form is your best evidence that you met your legal requirements to the buyer.

Tasty things.
A powerful running game that helps control the clock combined with no turnovers is almost a sure recipe for victory, especially if Wade Phillips' defense continues to play with the ferociousness it showed in the 17-10 conquest of Pittsburgh.
Meanwhile, the lobby cries rustic, with a front desk made from vintage dressers and signage you would expect at a 1950s drive-in. Elaine's Coffee Call, named for the hotel operator who would tend to then-resident David Mamet's beverage needs, brings a sleeker vibe with retro wall coverings and a white-brick facade.

Lady Gaga’s Monster Ball tour has been rolling strong for more than a year. Soon she’ll retire the show: “Born This Way,” her next album, is due out in May and, no doubt, she’ll have a fresh set of eye-popping costumes and props to accompany it. But she is determined to drive this juggernaut to the finish line. The Atlantic City show was the first of the tour’s final leg; she’ll be at Madison Square Garden tonight and tomorrow, and at the Prudential Center in Newark on April 22.

"I find it a little bit disturbing that that kind of an allegation would be made," Martini began, peering down at the prosecutor from his deep red bench.
"It's being physical inside the battles, not chasing the big hits," Blues coach Davis Payne said. "It's getting into confrontations physically where we feel that we can do a better job. Our drive to the net was as strong (against Dallas) as it was against Calgary. When we got there, we generated some good play."
What needs to die is a clerical culture that long fostered power, privilege and secrecy. What needs to die is an attitude that had placed concern for a priest's reputation above that of a child's welfare. What needs to die is mindset in which investigations of dissident theologians and American Catholic sisters were more swiftly prosecuted than investigations of abusive priests. What needs to die is, in a word, a certain pride. All of this needs to be surrendered.

There is a strong correlation between a Record of the Year nomination and an Album of the Year win. Tracks from 12 of the last 18 Albums of the Year have been nominated in the Record category, including 2010 Album winner Taylor Swift’s “You Belong With Me” and 2009 winner Plant and Krauss’ “Please Read the Letter.” This year, two artists nominated for Album of the Year also earned Record nominations — Eminem for “Love the Way You Lie,” his duet with Rihanna, and Lady Antebellum, whose booty-call ballad “Need You Now” crossed over from the country market to the pop charts. That’s 10 points to Slytherin and 10 to Hufflepuff; you work out which is which.

We geared outings to our young boys but nevertheless came across several stops that would suit those visiting without kids, including small wineries, ice cream shops and farmers markets.
On the flip side, Class 5 District 1 - which includes Fox, Jackson, Poplar Bluff, Summit, Seckman and Vianney - looks much weaker than Districts 2 and 3. Summit went 7-4 and advanced to the playoffs in 2011, but none of the other five teams had a winning record. Vianney, Seckman, Jackson, Poplar Bluff and Fox combined to go 12-38.
Owners also agreed to an expanded revenue sharing plan, and Stern called both agreements "a watershed moment" for the league. The plan, which will begin in 2013-14, more than quadruples the revenue currently shared by teams, with Stern saying they could now receive in excess of $20 million and at least six teams could pay $50 million into the plan.
Also, I wondered what kind of character would make a living ushering five-star recruits, many of whom came from single-parent households, to the doorsteps of salivating college coaches.
The poll also found that the toll hikes enacted last week haven’t soured voters on the governor, who has reminded them that the hikes were passed under former Gov. Jon Corzine.
With storylines about abortions and STDs and plenty of uncomfortable-to-watch sex, "Girls" is bound to repel at least as many people as it attracts. Its distinctive voice makes it feel fresh and original, and the poignant comedy gets better with every episode. It may not be as pretty as "Sex and the City," but it's more relatable. Even if your early 20s are behind you, "Girls" can take you back there. (And suddenly, growing older doesn't seem so bad.)

In 2005, Emily and Anjan Mitra opened San Francisco's first Southern Indian restaurant; the Mission spot was so popular that three years later they built a much more elegant place on Fillmore, with high ceilings, glittery chandeliers and an expanded menu- spice-crusted lamb chops; whole blackened branzino; and duck vindaloo. They then went back and remodeled the original and acquired a full liquor license. Both menus are geared to a lighter California sensibility, whether it's the prawns in a poppy seed sauce with coconut chiles and lime, or the dosa with creamy spiced potatoes, onions and cashew nuts with a touch of white truffle oil.
His approach to this project is just as clumsy.
His father gave him a shot of vodka and a cigarette to ease his nerves, and that started Van Halen on a near lifetime of drinking.
Once the plants are going, keeping them watered is the best protection against bolting. Given the plants' shallow roots, high temperatures stress them and force them to bolt, but moisture helps keep their roots cool.

I just tried to write honestly, and I tried to make this little world fun to look at, so people would take the time to read it. That was the full extent of my concern. You mix a bunch of ingredients, and once in a great while, chemistry happens. I can't explain why the strip caught on the way it did, and I don't think I could ever duplicate it. A lot of things have to go right all at once.
SEIU partnered with two other groups to launch ads in three Senate races warning Republican candidates not to attack government healthcare. The ads are running in Nevada and Montana -- where the Chamber is advertising -- and in Massachusetts, where Sen. Scott Brown faces a potentially tough reelection fight and the Chamber has an investment to protect. Brown was elected to the seat held by the late Sen. Edward M. Kennedy in 2010 with substantial help from the Chamber.

The primary concern, though, is the menu, which is timidly retro to the point of being boring. Sesame seared tuna with lemongrass sauce? That would be cutting-edge circa 1998. Roast chicken, seared salmon, onion soup, beet salad, and the ever-present steak-frites (with frozen fries, no less) should be conservative fallbacks for a 2011 menu - not a reason to come.
The definition of a No. 1 starter is his team has an excellent chance to win every time he pitches. No. 1 starters very rarely have a bad start. Masterson has had three bad ones in a row.

But just because someone given to spewing cartoonish hatred endorses a candidate, that doesn't make him a "surrogate" or a representative of any kind. Romney's campaign issued a statement calling for civility on both sides without mentioning Nugent, and that struck me as appropriate. To go further would have been to take implicit responsibility for every outrageous statement made by those with no more than a tenuous connection to the candidate.
Willy and Erick grew up sharing the same bed in a house across town, on the banks of the Bani River.

"The Incredible Hulk" -- Gargantuan center Shaquille O'Neal reinvents himself as a kinder, gentler Jason in a spoof of the "Friday the 13th" movies by wearing a mask and sashaying victims to death in ballet shoes, rather than slashing them with a machete. Rating: Better than "Kazaam."

øIt's been four years since Santigold's stunning eponymous genre-meshing debut (as Santogold), but she returns with all her revolutionary defiance and wicked grooves intact.

If the show wasn't as otherwise good as "The Killing" is, we might lose patience. But the show benefits from performances by the superb Mireille Enos as Detective Sarah Linden; Joel Kinnaman as her partner, Holder; Billy Campbell as mayoral candidate Darren Richmond; Kristin Lehman as his lover and campaign aide, Gwen Eaton; and Eric Laden as his campaign manager, Jamie - not to mention Brent Sexton and Michelle Forbes as the parents of the murdered teenager.

Johnston told me during intermission that he then began to have doubts about the piece and withdrew it for a time.

At the time when we were filming, I was so obsessed with him having a good time and making sure he wasn't cold or wasn't freaking out that I didn't really pay attention to the fact that he is actually quite a good little actor.

It helped that he had a friend along -- pop singer Iyaz, who performed a few of his own hits while Kingston took a breather backstage. But most of the credit must go to his excellent drummer, who kept the energy level at a manic pitch for most of the set. His pianist, too, was a thrill to hear, dropping unexpected jazz chords in the final verse of “Beautiful Girls.” (It was, however, slightly distressing to hear thousands of little girls singing the “suicidal, suicidal” chorus.) The set concluded with an enthusiastically received rendition of "Fire Burning on the Dance Floor," a song I still don't understand. What does it mean to fire burn on the dance floor, and if we should call 911 about it, as Kingston recommends, why on earth does he sound so happy?

This week while at my kitchen sink, I saw a white township truck go by followed by a “boom” truck — the kind used for tree work. I immediately threw on my coat, got in my car and headed south on Hemlock Point Road, not knowing what I’d find. To my relief, the trucks were nowhere in sight, apparently just passing through.
