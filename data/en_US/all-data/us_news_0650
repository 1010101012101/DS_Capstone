George Zimmerman, charged with second-degree murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin in Sanford, Fla., also had a personal website that solicited funds -- until his lawyer closed it down this week. It was not known how much money, earmarked at the time for expenses, was raised. Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer who shot the unarmed 17-year-old, was released on a $150,000 bond.

Is nuclear power the best option for Missouri's energy future? Perhaps.
The 9th Circuit resolved two other issues in the case, including finding that Proposition 8 supporters have a legal right to defend the law when the state's top elected officials refuse to do so. The federal court said it would abide by a California Supreme Court ruling last year allowing the group to defend the law without Gov. Jerry Brown and Attorney General Kamala Harris, both of whom consider the law unconstitutional and who praised Tuesday's ruling.
The scans also showed that in the 960-mile-wide Caloris impact basin, the northern part of its floor is higher than the south, with parts standing higher than its rim. This strange lopsidedness may have resulted from tectonic forces — and is one of the growing number of clues that the planet's surface must have been changing well past its youth.

In a letter to the governor that Cooley's office made available, the district attorney said he was mindful of Smith's lack of criminal history, age and good behavior in prison, indicating that he wasn't opposed to clemency on "equitable grounds." But he cautioned Brown against rejecting "the well-documented and widely accepted medical diagnosis, AHT," saying that would undermine public confidence in diagnoses of child abuse.
Other U.S. officials called for calm and warned of potential reprisals against Americans in Afghanistan. Angry villagers in Panwayi carried some of the corpses to the U.S. base from which the assailant had come, and military installations across the country, together with Western embassies and foreign organizations, braced for the possibility of mass protests.

Also at that time, Smith persuaded him to join her onstage to read some poems. Soon he started singing with a Bolinas band. Onstage, looking into the ancient distance, Jim was mesmerizing. Keith Richards helped the newly named Jim Carroll Band get a deal with Atlantic. The first release was 1980's "Catholic Boy" ("redeemed through pain. Not through joy"). Annie Leibovitz's cover photo of Jim with his arms around his parents gave permanent lie to the idea that he was some sort of punk. He wrote lyrics with Rancid and the Blue Öyster Cult, but also with Boz Scaggs.

� Transplant tomatoes as early in the month as possible to give plants enough time to set fruit. (Choose varieties with a shorter growing season of 60 to 70 days.) However, be prepared to cover plants during frosty nights. Tomatoes set fruit only after nighttime temperatures are consistently above 55 degrees. Tomatoes will not set fruit after daytime temperatures reach 90 degrees. Do not plant tomatoes any later than mid March.

The second-highest sale on the site was of a first edition of Harper Lee's "To Kill a Mockingbird," published in 1960. This copy of the American classic sold in May for $25,000; the high price tag probably came from it being signed by Lee herself. Now 85, Lee largely withdrew from public life after the publication of her first novel a half-century ago. Signings are rare; she never published another book.

What I don't get is why anyone thinks he shouldn't be loved for what he worked so hard to acquire. I mean, what was the point of becoming a Beatle if not to get the best-looking girls? Why bother making huge gobs of money if you don't think people should want to get near them? Near the gobs, I mean, and to those to whom they're attached. It's like pretending you don't want to be loved for your looks while signing up for 50 more face-lifts.
As the company opens its 2008-09 season with a return to the classic tale and its choreographic language of ineffable beauty, it serves as an internal marker of artistic growth.

While Colombian cumbia and vallenato have worked their way into the world music mainstream, thanks partly to the popularity of pop singers Shakira and Carlos Vives, marimba is just now making inroads, said Will Sabatini, an L.A.-based DJ known as DJ Sabo. He attended the festival last year by happenstance, after being hired to work a show at a Cali nightclub.
Frost and other Republicans said the lack of a high-profile campaign surrounding Issue 3, as compared with the fervent battle over SB 5, makes theirs a more significant achievement. While the conservative Tea Party collected the petition signatures, it had been relatively quiet since.
Of course, fascinating as it might be, to modern readers there is also much that seems silly and patronizing. The cover features an improbable pastiche of a Mission Revival mansion on the Pacific coast, palm and pine trees flourishing in the sand. The pages mix laughable illustrations (a drawing of decrepit Indians with the caption "The mission of the old padres was to make life brighter for such as these") with pictures of "types" of "Spanish" people — dancers from Casa Verdugo (one of the last Californio restaurants in Los Angeles), brides and musicians. Nonetheless the "California Mexican-Spanish Cookbook" is a critical link in the evolution of Mexican food in the United States. No longer would Americans have to rely on visits to restaurants when they wanted Mexican food; now they could cook it at home.

Indonesia sits atop a web of fault lines that makes the sprawling archipelago prone to volcanic and seismic activity. A giant 9.1-magnitude quake off the country on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed 230,000 people., nearly three-quarters of them in Aceh.Experts said the kind of devastation seen in the 2004 disaster and last year in Japan was caused by a particular type of earthquake. During Wednesday's quake, the tectonic plates were likely shifting sideways rather than up and down, leaving less of a chance for the giant waves, said Susanne Sergeant, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey.

A steal and two-handed slam 6 seconds later for good measure, followed by a Celtics turnover, got the party started.

Over the past two-and-a-half years, however, the parties that agreed on the bailouts and debt writedown appear to have lost nearly half their support, according to recent polls.

Wisely, and in contrast to what the popular culture often preaches, they both believe that she does not bear any responsibility for the affair. (After all, every married person has a flawed spouse who does not fully meet his or her needs - that's the only kind of spouse there is!) But now, as she sees him committed to the marriage, she's freer to enjoy pleasing him as a wife. And to ask in turn for what she needs from him as her husband.
Miller does no such modern weaseling. The sea nymph Thetis has been raped by a mortal and forced to give birth to Achilles. The utterly human Patroclus accompanies his uncanny half-divine friend to a mountaintop where the boys are schooled by a centaur. These events seemed real within the context of the novel and reminded me of a remark by Stanley Schmidt, the editor of Analog Science Fiction and Fact, that we have always told stories about alien beings, but in the past we called them angels and demons, centaurs and nymphs.
Workers removed a forgotten "Road Work Ahead" notice that lingered for more than a year on Gates Mills Towers Drive after crews finished construction on Mayfield Road (U.S. 322). Road Rant pointed out the left-behind marker in last Wednesday's column.

Doctors are faced with decreasing incomes and at the same time are beset by a huge proliferation in Medicare billing codes due to fee-for-service payments, and by increasing administrative quality requirements and insurance restrictions. Given the necessary legal responsibility and authority, doctors (not insurers) can define necessary care, which will cut excessive spending and end the fear of unfair, unrestrained use of health care. Doctors tend to resist this proposed responsibility, viewing it as the government again telling them what to do -- but many are ready for change. And this would be different: It could work according to rules that would be set by doctors for doctors, doing what federal and insurance company administrators cannot do.
City officials said extending the moratorium until Oct. 10, 2012, which Mayor Tim Leavitt called "a prudent move," would give city staff more time to settle inconsistencies between the city's current development code and the Vancouver City Center Vision Plan.

Also easy to dismiss: Because drunk drivers are implicated in nearly one-third of traffic deaths in the United States, killing roughly 11,000 people a year.

They were neither patronizing nor cynical about it, but seemed mostly sad and weary when they said, in effect, "welcome to our world."

The city's claim of underperformance is based primarily on the building's assessed value dropping 25 percent in the last two years.

"When you negate chances, you have to play safety first so they've played safety first, done a great job.

The campaign then scheduled its Gettysburg "rally" for 2 p.m. But this, too, turned out to be bad information. The few supporters who showed up were told by hotel workers that the event was only for the media. "They advertise it that he's going to be here so you can see him!"

So far, however, no new products have been added.

The city faces a $238-million shortfall, with more expected in the next few years. As he called for reductions to the Police Department's civilian workforce, Villaraigosa also laid out a plan that could allow the department to bolster the ranks of its officers by absorbing the security force that patrols city buildings and parks. Under Villaraigosa's proposal, about 97 sworn police officers at the General Services Department, which has a security force to patrol city buildings, could become LAPD officers. The consolidation could push the number of police officers on the force past 10,000, a goal long sought by Villaraigosa and the City Council, depending on how it is executed.

Bolton ruled that immigration is the responsibility of the federal government, not individual states. She issued injunctions stopping five parts of the law: requiring a law-enforcement officer to check a person's immigration status in certain situations; making it a crime to not carry "alien-registration papers"; allowing for a warrantless arrest if there is cause to believe a person committed a crime that makes him or her removable from the U.S.; making it a crime for illegal immigrants to work; and making it a crime to impede traffic while picking up or being picked up as a day laborer.

Describing the tough lead character Katniss, he says, "And Jennifer Lawrence -- no cookie-cutter cliché herself -- is a perfect choice.

His take: the explosion Wednesday night was less a deliberate expression of racism by Bostonians, or hockey fans, than an accidental, unmediated expression of biases that might otherwise go unprofessed. He distinguished between what he called "purposeful racism" and some of Wednesday's tweets, which he said were probably inadvertent revelations of racism  people writing in a virtual stream of consciousness to what they think is a small community of readers. Twitter offers an easy, instant forum for expression, he said, "and (tweeters) forget that the whole world gets to look at it."

-- The wine: Most Chardonnay is boring, but sometimes it's just right (think scallops), and in this season of entertaining, you need both memorable and well-priced. I'd tap this second tier from Jeffrey Patterson, who probably makes California's most dramatic Chardonnay. Distinct, ripe pear, apricot and guava paste offer plenty of fruit, but that coiled mineral power makes it unmistakably a Mount Eden effort.
"It's hard at first when you go to a different team, and a different system," said Crawford, who is with his fifth team in 12 seasons. "They already have things in place.

* The Blues' road effort and performance has been inspiring thus far. As you know they are 3-0 in the first half of a six-game trip, with wins in Nashville, Winnipeg and Calgary. Is a road personality beginning to form? Sure seems like it. In Nashville, the Blues won the kind of game that they normally lose there, and gutted it out to prevail in a building that's been an awfully tough venue for them. It was a win of determination. In Winnipeg, the weary Blues were outshot 41-16 and won a game that they probably had no business winning - a real sign of mental toughness. And in Calgary, the Blues jumped on a slumping team with two opportunistic goals on the power play.

Still, complying with the new rule will bring new costs, he said, and that could be passed onto customers. "If you continue to whittle away at sources of earnings while increasing banks' costs, the banks are going to have to make up the difference somewhere," Tenhundfeld said
The decision by California State University to slam the doors on new applicants next year will have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of hopeful students if it comes to pass. No one would be accepted for the spring semester except a handful of transfers at a few campuses, and all newly admitted students for the following fall — usually about 90,000 in all — would be warned that their spots were not secure. University officials say the only way this won't happen is if tax increases are passed to slow the mounting cuts at the state's most affordable and accessible four-year colleges.

Releford bemoans the fact that when it comes to awareness of health problems, "black men have been the hardest to reach," stemming in part, he says, from "under marketing."

"If the barbershop event were held in Chinatown, everyone in that community would already know about it," he says.
Paterson Deputy Fire Chief Mike Flemming said the two-alarm fire broke out shortly before 3:30 a.m. on North 7th Street in a two-and-a-half-story, wood-frame building.

Other scientists are finding that spring creep is affecting vegetation in New England. Charles Davis, an assistant professor of evolutionary biology at Harvard University, together with researchers at Boston University, discovered that in Concord, Massachusetts, climate change is especially harmful to certain groups of native plants linked by common ancestry. Using data taken by Henry David Thoreau, Davis and his colleagues published a study in 2008 that found native plants that have maintained their historic flowering schedule tend to be the "losers." These groups include many of the area's most "charismatic" wildflowers: orchids, roses, lilies and dogwoods. Davis said about 30 percent of the native species Thoreau documented in the 1850s are extinct in the area. Another 30 percent are so scarce that they likely will disappear.

The group has also thought to have gotten some help from Nigeria's Boko Haram, a worrying addition to international terrorism whose 115 attacks killed 550 people in Nigeria last year alone.

An alternative means to the same end would require everyone buying a drink to show identification.

The larger the bank, however, the more difficult it can be for the government to unload it; for example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had to manage the failed IndyMac Bancorp for eight months before finally selling it to a private equity group.
