Brosius' production is see-worthy for a host of reasons. First, choreographer Joe Chvala has infused it with lots of Swedish folk dances. Those moves, in a few big numbers, look good on the company. For her part, Adducci, an older looking Pippi, gives her character a blithe fearlessness and playful spirit. Whenever Pippi says her name in introductions, she throws in a series of cartwheels..

Mr. Roos's attendance is likely to stir emotions in Hiroshima, the site of the world's worst atomic-bomb attack, which killed some 140,000 people, either directly or from the effects of radiation.

He learned through his attempts to build stronger ties between Cornell's main campus in upstate New York and its medical college, 236 miles away in Manhattan. Rawlings said the effort was worth it because Cornell's medical college accounts for one-third of the university's research funding and because Manhattan-based donors have increased their giving to the Ithaca campus.

Behind the scenes, Cho was likeable, but guarded. He had a passion for cuisine, but not for talking, as conversations included long pauses and short responses. That didn't mean he wasn't quick to release his distinctive machine-gun laugh, or with an invitation to dine with him, but he never had the locker-room ease in shooting the breeze that is so prevalent in sports.
The movement has spread nationwide, from Boston to Kona, Hawaii, taking inspiration from the social-media-driven Arab Spring revolts in the Middle East.

It was the first cruise for my family, Disney or otherwise. We found the ship’s décor luxurious and the entertainment mostly top-notch. The food and service were hit or miss, and at times, the pampering didn’t live up to the top-dollar price tag. But all in all, we had a great time.

It might have been interesting to see exactly how Ankilewitz creates his artwork, but the film, which runs only 70 minutes, doesn't get into that. Also, some of the documentary's corny music cheapens the images. That aside, "39 Pounds of Love" is a heartfelt testament to one man's remarkable will to live -- even as he confronts death without self-pity or sentimentality. "Death," he says, "is something that happens."

The wine that bears the name  the Andis Wines 2008 Amador County Painted Fields  is pretty powerful and colorful in its own right. It's a veritable artist's palette.

It's been a tough road at times, but we've got some amazing fans who help spread the word, and business is always growing. While I don't know anything about the restaurant besides its name, my hope is that Fiesta Modern Mexican truly delivers what it is promising by claiming to be such. It would be wonderful for St. Louis to have some more innovative Mexican restaurants. The more chef-inspired Mexican restaurants we have, the more people will appreciate them, the more we can continue to push the boundaries of an amazing, underappreciated cuisine."

Immunity Challenge time! It’s the old sighted caller/blindfolded tribe. The women are very smart and pick Sabrina for their caller, who seems to be the only one of them who can communicate directly. Despite this, the women are not doing well, perhaps because Alicia and Kat are the first pair out. Bill is doing much better for the men. I like Bill. Once the men collect all their puzzle pieces, Bill sets out to solve the puzzle with a large lead. It’s a fairly complex puzzle, having to put pieces together to create foliage on a standing tree.

My mother had not followed all of those rules. Oh, her diet was reasonably healthy. And her mind was pretty active; she loved to read, and until her retirement had worked as an author and advertising writer. But she wasn't big on exercise.

Sunderland grew up in Thousand Oaks, where she was home-schooled by her mother and raised chickens and turkeys in the family's backyard, competed in 4-H club contests and earned enough money to purchase a retired show horse, which she frequently rode bareback down her neighborhood's streets. But at age 13, she writes, she was bored. She felt claustrophobic at home. The sea called to her. Her father Laurence, who builds and manages yachts, started involving his eldest daughter in his work, letting her sail and even deliver boats by herself. That's when Sunderland first told her parents she was going to sail around the world.
"We have to identify the gaps," she said. "Are the gaps based on race, on socioeconomics, or services received? We need to do a root-cause analysis to determine what's the cause, why do they exist, and what are the barriers that prevent us from moving forward? Then we have to put systems and structures in place so we're giving teachers opportunities to meet the students where they are, to take them to the next level."
A: Certainly, some of his stuff is scary, but to me, it's more mystic and almost supernatural. He talks about men who are on the verge of madness and that stuff is very authentic. You can sort of feel that. The other thing is, the space that is most revelatory for me is that twilight between waking and dreaming, and life and death, you know. I think in that sense he's talking about bridging two worlds, or going down into the underworld. The raven is the symbol from the other world, coming from the underworld up to him and is with him. I saw him as a pioneer into the underworld and the subconscious. The writings about those things, to me, have the most resonance.

A: It's true you need so much energy. But, you know, my ballet training really served me well. In ballet, there were so many times when I was tired, wiped out, and it doesn't matter because you have to keep going. That quality of pushing through, even when you're really tired ... well, it comes in handy. And that's how I do it. It is true what they say: They take so much energy. Of course, now that they're older, they're also very independent, and it's so much easier than it was when they were little. They do most things for themselves and that makes all the difference. We have a lot of fun and I just can't imagine not having the boys, we're just so blessed.

He makes sure she calls and takes her to buy a present. My birthday . . . nothing. He slept all day and watched football. He promised to take her to the store for her momma and didn't.

Like Johnson, I can imagine a more bare-knuckle and vicious production of “God of Carnage” -- a production in which Veronica’s outburst -- “I don’t have a sense of humor. And I have no intention of acquiring one” -- is a declaration of purpose, not a punchline. And like Johnson, I don’t really know why you would want to do it that way. Because despite its many proclamations of dark cultural and psychological truths, this play is a tickler: It lacks the weight of tragedy. Unlike such domestic brawl-masters as Albee and O’Neill and Ayckbourn, Reza appears to allow no quality of mercy to balance the savagery of her play’s world-view. Nor does “Carnage” carry the cool, hard anger of Pinter’s morally provoked absurdities. It’s more peep-show entertainment, the joker card in the deck, laughing and winking at the self-delusions of civilized society. That makes “God of Carnage” brittle and biting and funny, but ultimately more a cartoon and a provocation than a memorable immersion in the confusing lower depths of the human soul.

* Newly appointed Smackdown general manager John Laurinaitis continued his crusade against superstars who supported Teddy Long by pitting R-Truth against the tandem of David Otunga and Mark Henry. The match was fairly short and pedestrian, as R-Truth had a chance to shine a little against Otunga, but once Henry entered, it was all but over. In the end, Otunga demanded Henry tag him in, so he could earn the pin, and Henry told Laurinaitis' right-hand man, "You owe me one." Could Otunga repay the favor by getting Henry a rightful rematch against WWE Champion CM Punk after the events of Raw?
