The current project would cover 103 miles of river channel from the mouth of the Delaware Bay to Philadelphia for about $300 million. However, since a 2-year moratorium was placed on earmarks early last year, stopping pet projects from passing through Congress for the 2011 and 2012 fiscal years, the project has not received any federal funding to move forward since the original $77 million it received.

We replaced the dead tree with a second plum, which does not appear to be thriving despite our attention to its welfare.

The back cover of "Slouching Towards Bethlehem," Joan Didion's first collection of essays and the book that established her as one of a handful of major contemporary writers, advises that her pieces "all reflect, in one way or another, the notion that things are falling apart, that 'the center cannot hold.'

Most visitors encounter the islands' Portuguese culinary heritage — courtesy of plantation-era immigration — in local treats such as sweet bread and malasadas (doughnut holes) or Hawaiian-made Portuguese sausage (linguica and chorizo). But the recently opened Adega Portuguesa on a busy corner in Honolulu's Chinatown broadens their options with a Luso-Brazilian menu that includes a daily $12.99 lunch buffet and specials such as feijoada, garlic fried chicken and stuffed squid. That, and the occasional fado artist are reason enough to attract the North Shore's Brazilian surf squad into Chinatown, along with budget-minded foodies.

To a certain extent, this is nothing new, at least not for technology-adept computer users who have been comfortable, for years, buying personal computer software from indie developers. Sometimes known as shareware, these programs would often have devoted fans who shared their ideas (and complaints) with the software developer. Indie software developers rely on that sort of feedback. They know they need to respond to it, or else their customers will go elsewhere.

You know how that tenth bite of chocolate mousse just isn't as sensuous as the first? Still good, but you start to feel like you've had enough. Well, the same thing seems to happen when you simply imagine you're eating the food, only without racking up all the calories and fat.
I have to admit, I've never been a big fan of Alaskan king crab legs. Most of the time they're bland and stringy -- and frozen. These do not in any way resemble what I'd had before: Now I understand why it's considered such a delicacy. The taste of the crab meat is delicate and refined, and the texture is less meaty, say, than Dungeness crab; it's flushed a deep rose color next to the shell. At first, the waiter brings us sweetened mayonnaise for dipping, but when we ask for something else, he trots out a potent minced garlic sauce, which is stupendous with the crab. Even better, though, is a dab of crimson chile sauce.
It's happening because a raft of new laws enacted in the past year, including the financial overhaul package, have led to an acute shrinking of revenue for the banks. So they are scraping together money however they can.

In one of the worst cases of abuse, a woman told the AP she was beaten, raped and forced to work as a stripper in Detroit after being promised a job as a waitress in Virginia. A federal indictment last year in New York charged that members of the Gambino and Bonnano mafia families and the Russian mob were using fraudulent job offers to help Eastern European women come to the U.S. to work in strip clubs.
"She was surprised at how much she wanted to keep kissing him, though he was practically a stranger," she writes, describing the girl's first interaction with a man named Michael — white-collar, young and educated, the kind of man who should know better but does not: "She was feeling the same urgency she felt when she had a buck in her sights." Campbell highlights the link between sex and violence, the way one brings shelter and the other sustenance or protection, the way that, for a girl like Margo, options flatten and decisions become practical at a level most of us will never know.
Mr. Long's argument met challenges from both liberal justices presumed likely to uphold the 2010 health law and conservatives considered skeptical.
As the voice on the phone suggests, the real-life Marge, Homer, Lisa, Maggie and Patty hardly resemble their yellow, bobble-eyed alter egos.

For Hamas, a war would be a double-edged sword. A massive Israeli onslaught in Gaza could be devastating, but it would also rally support for its side and away from the rival Fatah. Hamas may prefer to avoid the risk.
Further, Constitutional amendments are not quick fixes. Both houses have to pass the amendment by a two-thirds majority. Then, three-fourths of the state legislatures must ratify the amendment within some specified time period, usually seven years. Then more delays — the House version of the amendment would take effect the second fiscal year following ratification, the Senate's after five years. Assuming state legislatures take the full seven years, this means that the House version would take effect in 2020, and the Senate version in 2023. How's that for responding to an immediate crisis?

On Sept. 22, 2006, Cage was walking down Beatrice Street, singing the Temptations' "The Girl's Alright with Me." From inside her house, a young woman heard Cage and stepped onto her porch. While the two talked, two plainclothes Wayne County sheriff's deputies rolled up and asked Cage for identification. They told Cage he resembled a shooting suspect. Cage pulled out his state ID and one of the officers called it in. Turns out, Oakland County had a warrant out on Cage for unpaid court fines related to a minor drug offense.
"The story turned out to be much bigger than the rape of two girls," she explains. "It seemed as if the entire community was in denial. The police had not properly investigated the crime. They gave up quickly. They did not believe my sister and me when we insisted that we did not know the perpetrator. And rape at gunpoint was unimaginable in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1973. Denial, I would learn, is immensely seductive."

What about retirement? By saving that $395 a month in a tax-deferred IRA, we'd save an additional $169,542 for retirement, according to our 401(k) planning tool. Logic ruled that we'd get the biggest benefit from funneling the cash into a retirement-savings account, but Gerry and I decided against that because we'd done our retirement planning and felt we were on target with our savings goals.

"Dark Shadows" — Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are snuggled warmly in their comfort zone in this chilly horror-comedy, their eighth collaboration as director and star, respectively, and their weakest by far. You don't need to know a thing about the "Dark Shadows" TV series that provides the inspiration. Tonally, thematically, visually, you've seen this movie before, with its oddball characters, skies in varying shades of gray and a foreboding sense of gothic mystery. It's actually a wonder that Depp hasn't played a vampire before; still, his long-undead Barnabas Collins, who's been buried alive for nearly two centuries and suddenly finds himself back in his insular Maine hometown in 1972, fits squarely within his well-honed on-screen persona. He thinks he's quite the charmer, but he's actually a bit awkward, and that contradiction provides the main source of humor. Or at least, it's supposed to. The script from Seth Grahame-Smith ("Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter") allows its family full of weirdos to shine, but too often is crammed with fish-out-of-water gags as Barnabas struggles to make sense of the time in which he's found himself. He struggles to understand modern romance as he courts the family's delicate, wide-eyed nanny (Bella Heathcote) and tries to fit in by smoking pot with the local hippies. Ho ho! "Dark Shadows" feels too languid, and bogged down as it is with an obsessive eye for costumes and period detail rather than offering anything resembling an engaging story. And by the time Burton finally puts his visual effects skills to their best use, in a climactic showdown between Barnabas and the witch who cursed him (Eva Green), it's too late. With Michelle Pfeiffer, Helena Bonham Carter and Jackie Earle Haley. PG-13 for comic horror violence, sexual content, some drug use, language and smoking. 116 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.
When the American Thoroughbred Horse of the Year for 2011 is announced in Los Angeles Monday night, the winner will most likely have been chosen for his or her consistency – a survivor in a year when there was no clear-cut star to emerge on the track and, in the words of the owner of the favorite to win the award, "a lot of upsets."

Speaking of a certain New York congressman, his determination to hold on to his job gets a reality check when the House returns to work next week. If Weiner's Democratic colleagues are sick and tired of answering constituent complaints about him, the pressure to leave may be too intense for even an abrasive New Yorker to resist -- and the fact that Pennsylvania Rep. Allyson Schwartz, the chief recruiter for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, came out early and hard for him to resign does not bode well. That said, the lefty blogosphere is generally rallying behind Weiner, and if he can hang on for a while -- and there are no more embarrassing revelations to come -- some other story almost surely will knock him off the front page. But even if he completes this term, his future is dim: With New York the only state besides Ohio to lose two congressional districts in 2012, Weiner suddenly becomes an easy sacrifice for the cartographers of Albany. And his long-planned run for mayor of New York in 2013 now looks to be straight uphill. Big Apple Mayor Michael Bloomberg says Weiner faces the same problem that Eliot Spitzer did when he got in trouble: No friends.
