The commission would review claims by people who lost loved ones or property in the fire, which started last month from the embers of a state-lit controlled burn. The claims process would be separate from filing a lawsuit against the state as a way for victims to receive compensation and could result in victims receiving far more money for their losses they than could through lawsuits.
Missouri remains fertile ground for argument because of its own brutish civil war within the great conflict. A slave state, Missouri narrowly stayed in the Union despite the efforts of its secessionist governor, Claiborne Jackson, who had mustered Frost's militia in St. Louis. Missouri provided 109,000 soldiers to the Union and at least 40,000 to the Confederacy. Within its borders, partisan guerillas and home guards clashed often.

Marco Reus marked his last game for Moenchengladbach by scoring either side of the interval in Mainz. The Dortmund-bound winger clinched his 17th and 18th goals of the season and then set up Igor de Camargo to make it 3-0.
A: Unlikely. And, to be honest, I think Joel Anthony is the one who has stepped forward in recent games, invigorated by his bench role. Not only don't I think Pittman plays in the playoffs, I'm not so sure Ronny Turiaf plays, either.
--In the California battle between former Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown and billionaire businesswoman Meg Whitman, a divisive issue is Whitman's proposal to eliminate state capital gains taxes, a move she says would help stimulate California's ailing economy but which Brown challenges.

Fiat's initial 20 percent stake was in exchange for technology and management prowess __ but no cash. The deal with the U.S. Treasury also laid out three benchmarks for Chrysler to raise Fiat's stake in 5-percent increments. It has exercised two this year -- for making a fuel-efficient four-cylinder engine in the United States and boosting Chrysler's sales outside North America. Approval of a new Dodge that gets 40 miles to the gallon will be the last of the three.

The bi-annual count is required for counties applying for homeless service aid from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
That's easier said than done with Brady, a former sixth-round draft pick who is 3-1 in Super Bowl starts. Not only do the Patriots use a no-huddle formation to speed up the pace of the game, preventing defensive substitutions, Brady is among the fastest decision-makers in league history. And few quarterbacks are as effective moving just a few inches within the limited space behind the line of scrimmage to avoid the pass rush. A step there, a slide there, and Brady frustrates hardworking defensive linemen perhaps more than any other quarterback.
A blown opportunity by the Blazers.
The next morning, I Bixied through the Plateau to St-Viateur Bagel, whose bagels (sorry, New York) are the best in the world, especially when fresh from the oven, and poked around Schwartz's for whiffs of another local specialty, smoked meat, such as hard-core pastrami.

They avoided such a fate from the very first period Wednesday, when they swarmed the Toronto goal like locust on crop. They were relentless, constantly moving, passing, in, out, back, shot, there, there, always there, scraping up enough ice to build a snow mountain and firing shots at Toronto's Ken Wregget that smacked of anger, nobody was going to beat them in this building, and so when the weary puck tried to escape someone in red always brought it back.

I've covered golf at Augusta National over the years. I'm not there this year, but I'm following closely mostly because of Tiger Woods. When I saw the replays of Tiger muttering profanities, throwing down a club, and kicking a club, I first thought about what a poor sport he was. Then, I thought about the media tent at Augusta National, no doubt bustling as the journalists settled in to watch Woods melt down. Because this week raised the possibility of Woods finally breaking out of the slump that's plagued him, but instead it featured him imploding all over that gorgeous golf course.

More than that, I’ve never felt that judgments of “good” and “bad,” insofar as a particular work is concerned, are the heart of the matter. There are bigger fish to fry -- reflecting the work accurately, analyzing its intentions and meanings, explaining its methods, and of course, trying to make the criticism an entertaining thing in itself.
Let's take a look at the Planning Commission agenda for this week (a document that is a little more difficult to find). The Planning Commission, in many cases, is the final decision-making body for land use applications (unless their vote is appealed to the City Council). The first order of business on the Commission's agenda is always the Call to Order by the chair, followed by Roll Call of the five commissioners, each of whom serves at the pleasure of a city council member. Next, the chairperson selects a member of the commission to lead the Pledge of Allegiance and, in many communities, an invocation that would be led either by a member of the clergy or one of the commissioners follows. Irvine observes a moment of silence. The chairperson then asks the Director of Community Services if there are any introductions, such as new staff members, notable figures or guests in attendance, and if there are any late additions or deletions for the agenda.

øBut Addicks - who met recently with Google, Facebook, Apple and other Silicon Valley companies - is dishing them together here in the kitchen, where he hopes to update the marketing concept of offering a surprise inside the cereal box.

To be sure, gas-powered cars are hardly invulnerable. Plenty of motorists ran out of fuel on that long drive home. But my hunch is that electrics would have faced similar problems or worse.

Roger Waters' live interpretation of the seminal Pink Floyd album, "The Wall," has been hailed as one of the best large-scale tours of the past decade (more enthralling than even stadium-hoppers U2). Waters last played Denver's Pepsi Center on Nov. 23, 2010 and will return on Monday for another sold out show. Of the 2010 performance, Reverb writer Candace Horgan said: "The spectacle part of the show ranged from a series of sparklers shot from above to mimic an airplane firing bullets, to the giant, menacing puppets of the teacher and a woman that resembled a praying mantis." Stuff your pockets with cash and try your luck outside the Pepsi Center — this one's worth it.

Because there is so much that needs to be done."

Insiders say "LOL" likely would have gone direct to DVD if it weren't for Mandate's foreign-distribution contracts, which contain a provision saying the movie must be shown domestically in at least 100 theaters.

The biggest move in our new mock draft is Texas A&M quarterback Ryan Tannehill rising to No. 4 to Cleveland (we had him going to Miami at No. 8 last week). Tannehill will be a pivotal pick in how the first round unfolds. He's rumored to be going anywhere between No. 3 (if the Vikings can find a trade partner) and No. 8 to the Dolphins—or he could fall out of the top 10. Because we move up Tannehill, the domino effect means LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne falls to Jacksonville at No. 7.

I've been a flat-out "news junkie" since I could talk. From the late 1930s onward, my mother instilled in me the desire to listen to radio (and eventually television) newscasts, to know what was happening in the world. Thanks to her tutoring, I could name every state capital by the time I was four (circa 1940). She emphasized knowledge was one of the most important factors in life. I represented Pittsburgh in the semi-finals for the national spelling bee in 1949. Obviously, mine was a very special Mom and pumped information into my noggin almost as similarly and as diligently as the fictional Jorel's words being pumped into baby Superman's head during his journey in the capsule from Krypton to Earth (in the movie "Superman", of course.)

The Medicare findings are bad news for President Barack Obama and his health care overhaul that is bogged down in Congress. That's because the higher Medicare Advantage premiums for 2010 followed a cut in government payments to the private plans last year. And the Democratic bills pending in Congress call for even more cuts, which are expected to force many seniors to drop out of what has been a rapidly growing alternative to traditional Medicare.

The chow: When you go to a Vietnamese restaurant with "Pho" in the name, you can guess their specialty is Pho. And, with 18 versions on the menu, you'd be right. Of these, the not-to-be-missed version is the Pho Chin, Nam ($6.50). Served, as Pho typically is, in a bowl so large any other culture would use it to serve side dishes to multiple guests, it is a fairly simple soup, containing only scallions and onions, an enormous mess of slippery noodles and thin, but wide, strips of beef. The beef is somewhat overcooked, making it slightly tougher and chewier than it should be, but the vegetables are fresh, the broth is aromatic and filling, and the side plate heaped with crisp bean sprouts, fragrant Thai basil and delicate sprigs of cilantro allows you to add a sprightly crunch to your meal.

Wilcox says he lost about half a million dollars -- his life's savings. But he's proud of the building and determined to move on.

Raising alcohol taxes would have a big effect on adolescents and heavy drinkers, but many problem users of alcohol would have enough money to keep guzzling. Some of them like to drink and drive, or drink and beat up other people. Telling them not to misbehave does not do much good, because being drunk makes them less responsive to the threat of criminal penalties. So we need to find ways of preventing drinking among the relatively small group of people who behave very badly when they drink.

The best food-truck food comes from existing eateries: On Friday, a group of five young adults walked by the Hancock Tower, turned onto Stuart Street and let out whoops and fist pumps at the site of the Redbones truck. Good reason — the truck offers the same great smoky meat you get at the popular Somerville barbecue joint. It’s cheaper, too! A single St. Louis Rib at the restaurant costs $4.99. But you can steal three for $6 at the food truck. KickAss Cupcakes also provides the same great experience out of the truck as it does at its retail store in Somerville.

Is there no middle ground? Well, yes. We note that “Restless City” is photographed by Bradford Young, who did “Pariah,” another small-budget independent that looked wonderful, and yet, for all of its obvious budgetary limitations, had the advantage of a canny, quietly riveting story. (Young already rivals Ernest Dickerson for his ability to capture subtle variations in the skin tones of black actors.)

The star, however, is the pizza, 12 inches of crisp crust spun lavash-thin and quickly christened in a furiously hot wood-burning oven so it emerges bubbly and puffy-edged. It's a style Franchetti perfected during training earlier this year at Vera Pizza Napoletana, the Italian-sanctioned academy of traditional Neapolitan pies in Marina del Rey (Los Angeles County).

That's what they do," Sharks defenseman Dan Boyle told CSN Bay Area after Game 4. "They pride themselves on that, and the chances we did have, we're just not very opportunistic."

The film was nominated for all the top Academy Awards of 1938 (Picture, Director, Actress and Actor) and while it only won a statue for writing, it has gone down in the history books as a much more popular and influential film than what did win Best Picture that year, THE LIFE OF EMILE ZOLA. Wellman hit just the right note across the board with A STAR IS BORN. It is fast paced, timelessly funny, brutally honest and still a tear jerker.

After a scuffling, stumbling start to the season, the Rockies own a 7-6 record. They ain't pretty. But they are gritty. Colorado has hung in there despite six errors by Tulowitzki, not to mention a starting pitching rotation held together by 49-year-old Jamie Moyer and duct tape.
The president, who has faced criticism from both the left and right for his handling of the spill, promised to restore the Gulf not just to the condition it was in when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded April 20 but to a state that reverses decades of decline.

The Joe Rickey is a controversial drink because nobody can agree on who invented it or whether the original was made with lemon juice or lime juice.

She was the ultimate expression of the age, the ship they said God Himself could not sink.

Retirement specifics: If you're in your 60s, beware the temptation to shift your entire portfolio to conservative assets.

In the late '60s, during the Johnson presidency, a big shift occurred when he decreed that only wines from the United States would be served in the White House. This tradition has continued ever since, in part because the shift took place at the perfect time in our country's wine history: the beginning of our meteoric rise to excellence in winemaking. Until then, no fine restaurant in New York City (or any other major city) would carry a wine from Oregon or Washington, let alone Arizona. There may have been a Beaulieu Vineyards, "George de Latour" Cabernet Sauvignon or an early Robert Mondavi Reserve, but that was about it.

The Flinders Ranges. A breath-catching landscape of crimson peaks and deep-cut canyons that shelter aboriginal rock paintings. Where it's easy to spot red kangaroos grazing at the side of the roadway, and pale-legged emus trotting at the edge of the distant horizon.

A major reason for this, of course, is price. The most famous sparkling wine, champagne, is rarely cheap. And that's sort of the problem. Most people still don't think beyond Champagne, which comes from a specific region in France - Wallace calls it "the high-rent district." Location means everything when it comes to sparkling wine. I love good champagne, but unfortunately the word "champagne" has become a license to print money.

"We understand that state funding has declined, costs rise and cuts need to be made, but the choices being considered are in no way in the best interest of the students.

True to form, Fey makes her point, and then quickly moves on, having fun at her own expense.

The project began in 2007 when Berhanu Tesema walked into a Northwest Portland running store to purchase some shoes and asked the sales associate, Andrew Buswell, now 27, "What do you do with the returned shoes that don't work out for people?" Buswell told him that many of the shoes are sent back to the manufacturer or recycled by Nike. To this, Tesema asked whether he could have some shoes to take to Ethiopia on his next trip there.

He went to school, graduated from college, found work, and is an American success story. When Buswell heard his story and of the shoes he wanted, he threw out the idea of starting a nonprofit that sent shoes to Ethiopia.
