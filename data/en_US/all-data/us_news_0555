So you know how some days everything just goes right? You find $20 in your coat, you get unexpected praise at work ... This is what Nioxin's Glossing Color Shield is like. I have thick, naturally wavy hair that would frizz in the Sahara Desert. But when I applied the Nioxin to dry, unruly, unwashed hair, it was suddenly glowing and smooth. My bangs, which normally need a good flat-ironing to keep in place, fell into the pretty wisps. It was a rainy morning, but when I got to work, my hair was still smooth with great bangs. Co-workers noticed. Doors were held open for me. At lunch, my salad was made correctly -- and with a smile for the first time EVER. The gloss lasted all day. My husband suggested we go out for dinner. My dog didn't have an accident. Can I really say this product caused all of these things? Well, no. But it made my life just a bit better. It'll now be a staple at home, and if you don't believe it -- well, next time you inexplicably hold open the door for a lady with great bangs, just ask me.

The vampire franchise didn't lack for attention or support last year, but the German filmmaker brothers Michael and Peter Spierig have come up with a new twist in "Daybreakers." (The film, produced in Australia, is in English.) The year is 2019, and vampires have taken over the world—they offered us a chance to assimilate, but we refused. As the newly dominant species, vamps hunt down humans and farm them, like dairy cows, for their blood. But there's a catch—a blood supply that has dwindled to the vanishing point. (A panhandler's sign says, "Need blood.") If vampirism is to survive, a blood substitute must be found.

Something old or new? Many of my friends in their 50s thought it was strange. I might add, I know only the groom's mother, but not the couple.I sent a gift card to a nationally known store for more than I would have spent on a shower gift, as I did not expect to be invited to the 'small" wedding. That was immaterial, however, as I am more perplexed by the proxy situation.
Perhaps all the reasons I heard in my workshop weren't thoroughly thought-out, but Susie and her classmates were on to something. People who choose to go into business for themselves are a trend that just won't quit. Small businesses are the leaders in job creation in the U.S. This trend began with the demise of the industrial economy and the rise of the knowledge-based economy.

She said the print is a linocut, meaning it's a design carved out and pressed with ink onto paper. She examined the print only through photos, but she said it's very unlikely the piece is forged because the piece would sell for so low in the grand scheme of major art fraud. She said she's examined many forged Picasso signatures in the past, but felt confident about Bodish's print.

-- Jackson obviously would have helped the Rams; he's a major talent. But Jackson also has two DUIs and would be in serious trouble with the league if he runs afoul of the law. That didn't stop Tampa Bay from risking $55 million on Jackson. And even if the Rams wanted to make a run at Jackson, Tampa Bay was in better shape to overpay. The Bucs are in spectacular shape on the salary cap and had money to burn. Now that he got paid, will Jackson go soft? Again, I think that's a fair question.

Nobody told me to stop shaving before visiting Humboldt County, but I figured it couldn't hurt. More than a few friends had described this stretch of coast and mountains 250 miles north of San Francisco as "granola central."

"I didn't think about the color of his skin because I lived on a block that was the United Nations of all. It was four black families, about nine families (of) Italian extraction, two Irish, two German, two Jewish. So it was a league of nations on my block.

The writing on the telecast was dreary, even by the lower standards of awards shows, so the surprises were much needed. And there were a couple of meta-moments.

And, it can withstand a trip to a farm market or stand, and won't crack or succumb to disease as easily as heirloom tomatoes, older varieties whose traits are controlled only by nature. Heirlooms are also criticized for their low yields and funny shapes - not a problem with the Ramapo or Moreton.
Just before noon, the advance elements of the Union left flank found their path blocked by the Warwick River, which — contrary to their disastrously inaccurate maps — ran east and west instead of parallel to the James River.

It's been 200 years since the War of 1812, a conflict that saw our country humiliated when the better-funded British army waltzed up the Potomac River and burned down the White House. It was, in part, our own fault. Antitax standard-bearers in Congress had refused to raise revenues in anticipation of war, forcing the Treasury Department to ask a private banker in Philadelphia to underwrite a huge loan in order to pay the troops. From that national embarrassment should have come an understanding that when it comes to the functions of government, some things are worth paying for, be it through taxation or taking on debt.

Memorials to firemen and policemen are usually well-maintained and Jersey has several, but this one is the most elaborate and was first erected in 1931 and moved to its current location in 1960.

"He was too good to pass up," Cardinals general manager Rod Graves said.
It's possible there were that many Babbitt fans, but the more likely explanation was that fans wanted the Blazers to get to 100 points, which would earn any fan attending a chalupa from Taco Bell. Usually when the Blazers get to within a basket of 100, the team will crank up a thump-thump-thump on the speakers and flash a "cha-lu-pa" on the scoreboard to start a chant.

Cyrus, in downtown Healdsburg, is blazing a new culinary trail, but there are no bumps along the road, as far as I can tell. For the past decade I've been waiting for a culinary explosion on the west side of the Mayacamas Mountains. Sonoma County has always been a destination as alluring as the Napa Valley, with great wine and locally grown products that could make Napa weep. Yet the restaurant scene has been a perennial stepchild.

There is a trial, and it's a stage for grandstanding Dist. Atty. Danny Buck Davidson (Matthew McConaughey). The actor wears the role of good ole boy-political opportunist as comfortably as the boots and Stetson. But most of the film is about how Bernie had charmed the town before the murder messed things up. Given Bernie's natural flamboyance and Black's tendency for excess, it is a testament to the actor's talent that he turns in such a finely wrought, restrained performance. There is a sense of affection and respect for the people and the predicament in every move Black makes. Bernie, Danny Buck, Mrs. Nugent and the rest are most certainly characters, but in Linklater's hands, they are never caricatures.
Kemp speculates da Vinci had one of two uses in mind for his invention: either to evacuate soldiers trapped in a high structure, or as entertainment at the lavish festivals he was fond of.

You broke my heart" -- but she's not going to go off on that fishing trip quietly. Following the finale, Teresa was tweeting up a storm, insisting that the comments in her cookbook were blown out of proportion, and that she didn't snub Melissa and Joe Gorga on Joey's 1st birthday party, as the epilogue intimated.

And from this over-tall seat you can feel all the familiar tinglings, the infatuating sensations of the automobile, pared to their essences. Why did the automobile succeed? And why is it still succeeding, in places like China and India, where citizens are mortgaging their meager lives to get a car? Here truth is revealed: The pleasure of cars isn't about high-end audio systems and heated seats. It's about mechanically multiplied self-determination. Free will with leverage.

That process was starting to happen with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), a disease that broke out of the "wet markets" of southern China in 2003 and was carried, via air travel, around the world. It infected about 8,000 people and killed 800 of them.

Quarantine of exposed people and isolation of the sick sufficed, within months, to break the chains of transmission and drive the evolving virus out of existence.

Don Markus: Having been a critic of Anderson's since he hired Randy Edsall, I came away with a little more understanding of the decision to go with Edsall rather than Mike Leach. Anderson's belief in the philosophy of Jim Collins, the author of "Good to Great," explained why he would rather go for someone with Edsall's track record rather than Leach. I still think that recovering from last year's 2-10 record is going to be difficult for Edsall when it comes to winning back what can only be described as a fickle (or frontrunning) Maryland fan base, and so I think it's going to be tough on Anderson as well. But I respect the fact that he stands by his man. Some ADs I have known over the years might be trying to push Edsall out.

It is a conceit of our times that kids are supposed to be manageable only by their peer groups, that they are in headlong rebellion from any other authority and, the postulate has it, there is no way a street kid from Philadelphia or a blacktop player from Lexington Avenue could relate to a Bible reader from Indiana who coaches by wall motto. In a time when training table mutinies are as commonplace as any other forms of campus unrest, Wooden has managed to put together title teams from elements as diverse as a Democratic ticket.

Top Picks Analysis: Though the Cardinals entered the draft with a very shaky situation at offensive tackle, they couldn't resist taking arguably this year's top wide receiver prospect in Floyd with their initial pick. Though the talented Notre Dame product comes with some off-field baggage and was nicked up at times during his college career, his size, competitive nature and excellent after-the-catch ability should help eliminate the constant double coverage Larry Fitzgerald routinely saw last season. Arizona did address the offensive line by astutely grabbing the sliding Massie in the middle of the fourth round, giving the team a powerful run blocker with the agility and long arms to possibly handle the left side as a pro. The first defensive addition came in the form of Fleming, an intriguing size/speed prospect with a few character concerns but who also possesses a starter's repertoire.

Improving conditions in Mexico also explain the diminished flow of Mexicans moving north.

The corps' admission that it might do something differently next year is monumental - not so much for the changes that might occur, but for the political opening that it signals.
But sometimes treating the human body gets reduced to mechanics and logistics. The “science” of nursing -- monitoring vital signs and lab values, inserting IVs, and, of course, documentation -- can disrupt the “art” of nursing, that human connection between nurse and patient.
It's college-selection season—a difficult time made even harder because the average cost of a four-year institution has climbed to more than $21,000 annually. Along with the usual queries about majors, dorms and dining halls, it's worth asking some more subversive questions: What's college for? And is it still worth it?
In 1904, Abe Doumar was working at the St. Louis World's Fair when a local ice cream vendor ran out of plates.

Today Doumar's Drive-In offers four ice cream flavors and two sorbets in the famous cones, which are still made on the original cone machine. Shakes, sundaes and sodas are also available.

Outside of Wall Street and state health bureaucracies, few understand how Centene operates, or how it has transformed itself into a fast-growing powerhouse. The Clayton-based Fortune 500 firm navigates a complex and controversial field with a simple business model: Save states between 5 percent and 8 percent of the cost to care for their poorest, sickest and youngest patients - and pocket a piece of the difference. To help get those deals, Centene fields an army of lobbyists with a war chest for political and charitable donations.
The headline sensationalized the situation, implying the city did wrong. Shouldn't this article really have been praising the city for handling this correctly, if the situation even constituted news at all?

Aficionado favorite Talib Kweli rhymed with precision and high-speed enunciation rare for Summer Jam -- and also with aggressiveness frequently missing from his recordings. Sadly, Kweli and deejay Hi-Tek had a tough time motivating the crowd. The lyrics-conscious emcee -- one unafraid to rap about Iago and Othello at a stadium rap concert -- seems doomed to be a perennial backbencher in the hip-hop parliament. Ever polite, Kweli gave the mic to British R&B singer Estelle in the midst of his set; her rendition of “American Boy” was charming, if a bit predictable.

I followed up the first three strikes with a second set, striking through the sixth frame. Every ball was a nice pocket hit, and I knew as I released each, the result would be a strike. I was in a groove, feeling that the dreams I had had since I began bowling at ten, that of bowling a 300, were about to come true! I continued striking through the ninth frame, and the crowd started gathering behind our lanes. The tenth frame, and 3 more strikes, and perfection was mine. I felt it inside, and knew this was the moment. This is what I had been striving for since my first days of little Bantam League bowling at Carter Bowl!
