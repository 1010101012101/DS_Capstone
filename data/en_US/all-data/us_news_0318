Bay Area residents would be best served to not drive into San Francisco over the Golden Gate Bridge this weekend, unless they enjoy sitting in gridlock.
Someday someone will write a fascinating book about this Golden State Warriors season and it will be an amazing read. Nearly every week, something bizarre is happening out there. You want to forget about it, but it is impossible. Not reporting the insanity to NBA fans just so they can rubberneck would be a small crime. So here's another chapter.
The Knights said they asked for the child to be taken out of the foster home. Turner asked if they could find a relative to take him, they said.
As unbelievable as it sounds, not all Greater Clevelanders like summer very much. Some of us just weren’t built for heat with high humidity. I’ve always felt as if I were actually melting, and I know people who’ve been hospitalized for dehydration.

For clarity's sake, since they've been playing the clip of Coughlin's stern reply to the "breaks" question, he realized today what I was driving at: "We had two outstanding plays to get the ball back when the ball was on the ground. Where's Mike? I acknowledge you Mike. You did a heckuva job at the end of the game. You were right." When I tried to move my recorder closer to get that one for posterity, Coughlin quipped, "I'm not repeating that. And that's not for publication, either."

Clinton has publicly called for Chen's release, but his apparent attempt to seek refuge through the U.S. Embassy forces the issue as never before.

Norman Chad, Washington Post: "Naturally, MLB Commissionner Bud Selig issued a statement supporting the Marlins' decision to suspend (Ozzie) Guillen, saying, "Baseball is a social institution with important social responsibilities . . . Mr. Guillen's remarks have no place in our game." Interestingly, Selig sat side-by-side with (Fidel) Castro when the Orioles traveled to Cuba for an exhibition game in 1999. Hmm.

For me, as a working critic, Telluride always amounts to a welcome rite of passage -- a passage from the dispiriting sameness of the coarse, aggressively stupid summer movies that fill the multiplexes to the renewed pleasure of watching nuanced human behavior on a big screen. Philippe Claudel's debut feature "I Loved You So Long," in subtitled French, provided that pleasure in hearts and spades. Kristin Scott Thomas is Juliette, a gaunt pariah who comes to live with her younger sister, Léa, after serving 15 years in prison for a terrible crime. While Elsa Zylberstein is splendid as Léa, Scott Thomas's performance is absolute perfection -- sometimes hooded, occasionally ferocious, often unshowy (and not at all showy about being unshowy). The plot is not without its manipulations, but the film is so subtle and smart that you either don't notice or don't mind.
The client receives a variety of cloth diapers, so she can try out different styles when the baby arrives and decide which one she wants — if any.

For the most part writing is a solitary pursuit, carried out isolated from concentration-interfering influences and/or noisy interruptions.

Note: If one of these three wins the trials, he does not earn an automatic Olympic berth. He would have to finish ahead of reigning World medalist Jake Varner at a later tournament.
“We’re trying to right the ship,” he said.
This will not improve holiday travel. Unions already make getting rid of problem employees difficult. Those screeners who pat down too enthusiastically will get a union to hide behind. Do you think that will improve travel? Americans put up with these screenings to protect against terrorists.

"I am my clients," Camposano says. "I always spent a lot of money on highlights, and taking care of my hair, and then back in a ponytail it went."
The Answer: Most employees who lose their jobs through no fault of their own are eligible to receive unemployment benefits. You're out of luck if you were fired for misconduct or quit without cause on your own. Generally, anyone who worked full time over the course of a year, which is called a base period, probably will qualify.

It took the Pacers years to recover, an entire franchise nearly wrecked by the lost head of one player. The NBA saw one of its darkest nights. You'd have thought that would set a man straight for good.
Hey, Tony: My wife's Denver Broncos are 6-1 since Tim Tebow was installed at QB. The comparison between the successful Broncos to the disappointing, disturbing, disgusting, disheartening Browns is inescapable. Something is fundamentally wrong with Cleveland and its sports teams. Fundamentally wrong, beyond "not good-enough players," coaches who don't get it, cheap or reclusive ownership. Give us your candid and honest opinion and let the chips fall where they may. -- Wayne Hopewell, Colorado City, Colo.
"They went on a run there," Diggins said. "I just remember we cut it down to three and they went on a run. I saw 10, 12, 14, 16, 19. We couldn't get rebounds when they missed shots."
Her presence, said Chris Mathes, who runs the company’s North American headquarters, "just shows how serious New Jersey is about biotech."
A Marion Superior Court jury today convicted one of three defendants of murder in the August 2010 shootings at a birthday party on Indianapolis' Near Northside, in which two people were killed and six wounded.
For one of the seven main courses, Berthold reinvents cassoulet ($27). The star is the perfectly cooked confit leg that tops a blend of barley, shiitake mushrooms and precise chunks of sausage and dices of carrots and green garlic. Aged tamari gives the dish an interesting sweet, rich edge that makes it more wine friendly. Grilled Cobia ($27) nests around Tokyo turnips, broccolini, nuts and sour cherry nicoise olive tapenade. It reads like a mishmash of flavors, but it comes together miraculously with one of the owner's wines, the 2007 Parr Selection Pinot Noir from Oregon ($6.50/taste).

Even as Giraud's productivity narrowed in recent years, his stature in the creative community seemed to grow as young illustrators, digital artists and video game designers looked to his work as a key compass point. In October 2010 the Fondation Cartier Pour L'Art Contemporain in Paris launched a lavish five-month exhibit of Giraud's work that included small, humble sketches and majestic wall-sized pieces.
Black & Veatch, a Kansas City, Mo., engineering firm, which shrank from 9,600 employees before the recession to about 8,700 today, is hiring about 100 workers a month. About 10% of its workers are temps, says Jim Lewis, the firm's human-resources chief. "That's a quick way to bring people in, and gives you a little time to see if growth is going to hold or not," he says.
Forecasters at the weather service’s Mount Holly office said a storm front should cross New Jersey today, bringing with it potentially heavy rains and flash flooding. But it may stall just to our south after that, potentially providing a railroad for torrential rains to travel up the coast as early as Saturday.
If Oakwood Commons succeeds -- and presumably First Interstate would not invest $45 million without serious commitments from retailers -- it will pump money into the Cleveland Heights-University Heights School District and South Euclid's coffers. It will almost double the park space in South Euclid and lay the groundwork for residential and other development on the 90 acres of the old golf course that Schneider's firm just bought in Cleveland Heights.
East coach Linwood Barnes said being on such a big stage made his senior run extra hard.

WASHINGTON — NPR president and CEO Vivian Schiller resigned today under pressure from the news organization's board, a day after an undercover video showed one of her executives on a hidden camera calling the tea party racist and saying NPR would be better off without federal funding.
What if this still left you deeply in debt?
Asked if he was worried about the Senate's delay of Aerotropolis, Slay said no.
The charter bus ride to the Giudices' hill town outside Naples is long and tedious and wears on the Guidices' young children. Many pans to Caroline looking exasperated, but it doesn't look like we're going to get to see any fireworks between Caroline and Teresa over the latter's rather questionable childrearing tactics. The worst we get is Caroline saying, "I was annoyed," and Al commenting that the kids need more discipline. Maybe if Danielle Staub doesn't return as rumored, we'll see more "Housewives" infighting. Caroline vs. Teresa? Epic.
Noah was one of the top offensive rebounders in the league and the Bulls figured on missing his presence in the middle. Led by Deng and Boozer, the Bulls instead went out and controlled the boards, holding a 49-29 edge early in the fourth.
The defense in the Manning case has filed a separate motion seeking dismissal of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy. That offense carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
In 2007, Leopold signed an executive order preventing the county from doing business with anyone who employs illegal immigrants. In 2008, the county detention center began checking prisoners' immigration status with federal authorities, resulting in several deportations. In 2010, the county joined the federal Secure Communities program, which employs fingerprint identification using federal databases, giving law enforcement officials the ability to quickly identify illegal immigrants.
Toyota's sales were affected not only in Japan but also in the U.S. and other important markets as reduced car production fell short of demand.
Box: $186.50
One day, we were driving down a street where we'd just distributed flyers and they were all gone. We saw the mail carrier, asked him about the flyers and were shocked when he opened the back of his truck and it was loaded with candidate materials (ours and others) that he had removed as he delivered the mail. He advised us that all parts of the mailbox, including the post, are the domain of the U.S. Postal Service I couldn't find any laws or policies about this.
In the 2007-08 school year, the Lake district spent about $285 million to run the schools, or $6,914.80 per student. Of that, about $163 million came from the Tallahassee, and the state-set local property-tax rate brought in another $122 million.
If Hilmar reminded us of life in L.A., Mooney Grove Park in Visalia dropped us right back into the Central Valley's role as a turn-of-the-century agricultural hub. Huge old oak trees surround the 155-acre preserve's lovely but faded landmarks: low bridges stretching across a murky lagoon, cowboy statues, deserted docks and a museum complex with rusty farm equipment and replicas of a 19th century school and blacksmith shop. Even the plastic-free playground seemed of another era.
Paul Moffett was riding in a long-distance bicycle ride with 30 miles left to go. He came up on a hill and realized he didn't have the energy. Moffett, 63, got off his bike and walked up the hill.

Some possibilities positive Cordle, the chief analyst at AirlineForecasts, says Cleveland could actually grow in a merger, though it probably would sustain initial route cuts before emerging stronger.
"If this were a state that bled red, he'd be all good," Spence said. "Maryland is a state that is so Democratic, there's no way he can spin it. His legacy should be tainted, but those people who believe he was a great governor are still going to believe that."
Tuesday was the GOP's night to shine winning key Senate races in a number of states including Indiana, Arkansas, North Dakota and Wisconsin, but apparently not enough to topple the Democratic majority.
Still, retail sales have been solid. Gas prices also are beginning to fall, after a four-month surge pushed gas to nearly $4 per gallon earlier this month. The price of gasoline in the U.S. has dropped by nearly 8 cents per gallon since the first week of April following a decline in oil prices and gasoline consumption. Gasoline, on average, now costs about as much as it did a year ago.

"I was superintendent for 15 years and worked with a variety of boards. Test scores were going up, and we opened 30 schools. I had a lot invested in Capo Unified. When I see what happened to all those people, I'm disappointed, heartsick about it."
All this history has those who would push for more consolidation treading lightly. Civic Progress is exploring the issue, Irwin said, but needs to find out what voters might want. And for now, politicians on both sides of Skinker Boulevard talk more about baby steps, such as sharing services, than about launching a full-on campaign to undo the city-county split.
“Sales are improving at a snail’s pace from near record lows, with the South accounting for the lion’s share of the gains. Inventory continues to shrink — good news, since builders will have to replenish stocks by ramping up on starts once demand picks up,” IHS Global Insight economists Patrick Newport and Erik Johnson wrote in a note to clients. “New home sales should fare better in 2012 than they did in 2011, when they set a record low.”
"I can tell you from being at the ski areas that it's going backward fast," said Jim Pokrandt, spokesman for the Colorado River District.
Album fans, take heart: Dispensing with the album as a consumer item doesn't necessarily mean tossing it aside as an art form. Do today's readers think less of Charles Dickens' novels because they first appeared as serials? Radiohead is an album-oriented band, but wouldn't its recent experiment with "In Rainbows" have generated as much or even more buzz if the songs had appeared over time? Would fans of "Sgt. Pepper's," "The Wall" or "American Idiot" think less of those albums if the first journey through their component songs had taken weeks or months?
"Well, you'll have to talk to him first," the owner finally said in his deep, baritone voice. Told that Johnson had indeed been interviewed — and that he's still fond of the Orioles — Angelos, who rarely gives media interviews, opened up.
On his Facebook page, Satterfield placed photographs of himself with Heather’s infant daughter. And he regularly posted items about love of children, including his most recent post on school violence.

Not to miss: The fish-sauce wings are the best thing you've ever eaten, but the Papaya Pok Pok salad, lemongrass-stuffed game hen, and spicy boar collar with chilled mustard leaves have ardent constituencies for good reasons. Try a fruit-flavored drinking vinegar for a novel wallop.
In an industry where profit margins are thin and competition is brutal, those return rates are unsustainable, says Mitch Cline, managing director of Accenture’s electronics and high-tech group.
Jermaine's rendition of a song that I admittedly was not familiar with was very strong. His baritone voice soared in the chorus, and it was definitely a step up from last week. I'm still unsure as to how long the Pine Hill native is going to last, though, as his bass tones can only be original and fresh for so long before he starts to sound like a one-trick pony. Then again, a pony that can sing probably only needs one trick anyway. But I digress. Side note: What was up with that crazy jacket with the shiny, black sleeves? Did they run out of fabric to clothe this enormous man and had to use trash bags from the maintenance closet?

A few remarked that homework has been the biggest adjustment.
"From an artist's standpoint, you want your loyal fans down front to help create the energy for the night," Litman said. "The artist feeds off the energy and in turn puts on a better show for the entire audience. It's a way of treating your fans with respect. It's also a way to make money."
True, there may be questions about how hard to cut budgets and how best to time the cuts, but with government-bond investors going on strike, policy makers either don't have a choice or feel they don't. Budget austerity is also a recipe favored by Germany and other euro-zone governments that hold the Continent's purse strings.

And even if the Republican members are the let's- make-a-deal sort -- the kind favored by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner -- there's no way the Republican-run House would accept the kind of tax increases required to spare entitlements the knife.
"But who am I to say they're overdoing it. I love love and I hate hate, but I feel like it's a terrible world. I wish John Lennon was still here," she said.
You'd have to ask Jim, but I can only imagine that upon hearing the words "30-minute run," I must have shot him quite a look. I'll bet I could have breathed fire. Had we not come in one car, I am sure I would have dropped the class on the spot.

As an architect, Philipsen has noticed that most airports weren't designed for the security functions they must now accommodate. As a result, passengers are often jammed into spaces too small for that purpose. BWI's new Southwest Airlines terminal, he said, is a welcome exception.
Think about this as a simple word problem. You have a brand with widespread appeal. Scenario A: You have the capability to produce and market a new version of this product every 12 months and sell it for $60. Scenario B: You also have the ability to make a superior version of the product and release it every 36 months for $60, while selling about $40 more in DLC to only some of your customers between releases. If the variable f, for fandom, is constant, you always make more money under Scenario A – always. This is why things will probably never change.
They will also return to a different family dynamic. Siblings -- and parents -- have adapted to life without them around the house. Friendships have also likely undergone changes, as Spencer Gallardo discovered.
Arts-group leaders have a small peer group to turn to for advice, Schreyer said, and Knight could be counted on to be an impartial sounding board.
The future of American aid to Egypt has come under greater scrutiny since Mubarak was forced out of power on Feb. 11 after 18-days of mass protests last year. A council of top generals has ruled the country since, and the country's first elected parliament since the uprising was seated this week. Its domination by Islamists has raised concerns in some circles that the new government could seek changes in Egypt's peace treaty with Israel.

Golden temple: Waiola Bakery and Shave Ice, 525 Kapahulu Ave., (808) 735-8884. The little shop in the McCully neighborhood is better known on the island as one of the few places near Waikiki where you can get a first-class shave ice (Hawaii's vastly superior take on the traditional snow cone). But I come for the golden-topped baked goods, especially the amazing sweet azuki bean rolls. A soft globe of dough wraps the sweet, brown paste in the middle.

"In reality, he didn’t. He just didn’t pay the bills," said Greenwald (D-Camden).

This is not a new normal, this is an old shoe, just more comfortable."

But by Aug. 1, when Kevin Mahanay's Lexus sedan made a right turn at that corner without stopping, things weren't all that clear from the camera's angle; a scrawny tree had sprouted enough greenery to obscure the camera's view of some of the traffic light.Yet the device flagged Mahanay for a $100 ticket.

With The Star's computer system, content that runs in more than one section is designed and proofed on the page where it appears first.

But there is more. Educators from the U.S. Secretary of Education down notice the effort at Mitchell, yet success breeds new problems. The district reassigns some of the teachers -- including Robles -- to try to strengthen the district overall, even if it means breaking up the group at Mitchell.

The biker quartet consists of John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy. Never mind what work they do, since the movie's gestures at characterization are rudimentary. What they do on the road is pretend to be tough, run into real Hell's Angels-style outlaws and, by taking them on, become the men they wanted to be. "Wild Hogs," which includes a cameo by a live revenant from "Easy Rider," gives a bad name to carpe diem, but could have been worse; the trip might have started from Bangor.
Actually, the balloons, bunting and bands belong more to football, which is better at extravaganza, at least until it turns it into excess at Super Bowl. Even basketball, because of the advanced level of sheer athletic ability needed to play at the NBA level, does hoopla better.

Other cities, including Bloomington, Richfield, Minnetonka and St. Louis Park, said they were not seeing the same kind of rise in charitable and community events that Golden Valley is seeing.

Jimmy is still working out his place in the food chain, and now Angie is onto him. She overhears a conversation and takes the kids to the beach, where she meets a bohemian writer who’s not afraid of getting a ticket for revealing too much leg. In a nice period touch, a lady cop comes along and tells the writer, Louise, that her bathing skirt has to be six inches below the knee. Angie tells Louise that the cop will measure it, as they really did back then. Louise doesn’t care, and soon she and Angie are canoodling at a party full of bootleg hooch and flamboyant dancers.

Sharon Palmer, a dietitian and author of "The Plant Powered Diet," said breakfast at a restaurant “can be the most decadent meal of the day." It can account for at least half a day’s calories and exceed the required sodium for a day. But Palmer is happy with healthy trends, such as the addition of "lite" or "fit" menu offerings in the 500-calorie range. “The best news," she said, "is that these lighter meals are hot sellers -- showing that people are tired of eating these traditional American gut-busting breakfasts."
Olympic-caliber horses cost well into six figures. Authentic was in Holland when another wealthy horse lover, Elizabeth Busch Burke of theAnheuser-Buschbrewery family, helped John and Beezie buy the unproven 6-year-old in 2001.

New mortgages taken out to purchase homes increased for the first time in six weeks, rising 7 percent. That's an encouraging sign for the housing market, as applications had dropped off sharply when federal tax credits expired.
Bach’s “Christmas Oratorio” may take a back seat to the “Messiah” and “The Nutcracker” this season in terms of popularity, but it’s no less worthy. That’s especially true of Chailly’s recording with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Period ensembles have become increasingly common. But this disciplined, flawlessly balanced modern version is sung and played with impeccable precision and tonal beauty. While the orchestra’s translucent, glistening sound has much to admire, the selection of soloists may be a greater asset. Carolyn Sampson’s radiant soprano bears comparison to Dawn Upshaw’s. Fresh-voiced tenor Martin Lattke offers crisp, natural recitatives as the Evangelist, and fellow tenor Wolfram Lattke manages florid arias with ease. The expressive alto Wiebke Lehmkuhl and the effortless-sounding bass Konstantin Wolff round out the quintet. The only caveat is that the recording can occasionally sound a little too straitlaced, particularly during choruses. But this also means that the work’s most celebratory moments stand out and can be easily appreciated.
To be sure, the fast-expanding Asian market, and China in particular, has delivered much of the industry's volume growth in recent years.

The Beavers play Monday and Wednesday at Gill Coliseum, both 7 p.m. tips against West Alabama and Hofstra, before heading to East Rutherford, N.J., to begin the Legends Classic championship against Texas on Saturday.
A: I think the district has changed over the last several years. We currently only hire firefighter/paramedics cross-trained to ride on either a fire truck or ambulance. And our fire trucks are all ALS equipped, which means they have advanced life-saving equipment on board. The newer buildings in this area, with new fire codes in force now, are safer. But I think the need for fire protection will never go away, and our residents can rest assured that our service will not be compromised in any fashion.
Gardner also told the board that over the past 10 years, he and his brother have developed plans for an organic farm and residential program for troubled youth on a 160-acre parcel in northern Utah.

Filling the truck is like “playing Tetris” — Woody’s words — an exercise in how to make it all fit. In one day they pick up: a twin bed from a woman who answers the door in her pajamas; two electric wheelchairs that have been left out in the driveway; a bedroom set, a carpet shampooer, a sofa, a TV, a comforter cover and a green-striped easy chair from the garage of a home with a barking dog. The back fills up so quickly it’s hard to pass a sign for new “Townhomes Starting at $275,000,” the raw earth newly turned, without imagining them as silos for more things.

Food lends itself to good writing because, as M.F.K. Fisher so famously wrote long ago, writing about food often means writing about “other, deeper needs for love and happiness.” In defense of her craft and her subject, she declared: “There is a communion of more than our bodies when bread is broken and wine is drunk.” What was true in 1943's “The Gastronomical Me” is certainly true in 2012. If anything, the appetites seem sharper in this schizophrenic age where computerized whiz-bangeries distract us from a gray, downsized reality. Looking to feed a literal and figurative hunger are scores of food writers, chefs, food bloggers and even would-be food TV stars.

Brown indicated at the beginning of the season that he didn't care about playoff seeding so long as his team peaked and remained healthy when the postseason began. Still, the team's development correlated with the wins anyway. Two months ago, the Lakers sat in seventh place in the West and faced all kinds of challenges. The Lakers went on a 13-game stretch where they didn't score more than 100 points in a game. The constant change of the rotations left both players uncomfortable with their role and Brown unsure of what he had. Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol and Andrew Bynum carried most of the load, and logged heavy minutes with it. And the team's bench remained last in the league in both points per game and efficiency.
