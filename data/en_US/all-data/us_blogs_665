Review: Read this now! The cover of this book is awful and even the summary did not really seem appealing to me. However, this style of writing, the incredible plot twists and adventures and the creative characterization really make this book a must read. Its not hard to suspend disbelief in the beginning of the book (when you meet Ender and realize a 6-year-old is thinking much more intelligently than normal) if you just remind yourself that this is the future and this is specifically what he was born for. The ending is absolutely satisfying, especially since there is a series that follows this if you're so inclined to read more, but you don't feel you have to either. I highly recommend you pick this up and read it, or listen to the audio for more of the intended attitudes of the characters. You won't regret it!
Today is a special day for me. It marks the date on which I have officially become a published author in the United States.

“Smoking Allowed” environments are no less viable than “No-Smoking” venues when it comes to meeting the expectations of public demand for a choice among such privately owned, public venues. The hospitality and leisure industries are disproportionately impacted by Ohio’s smoking Ban because they are specifically designed to be more than simply another “place of employment”. They are designed to offer hospitality and accommodation, but the smoking ordinance specifically disallows their stock in trade.

Those are the big two, but some of the little guys punched above their weight class. Cambodia killed and starved a third of their population. There were mass killings by communists in Vietnam, North Korea, Romania, Bulgaria, and East Germany, but those guys were just icing on a murder sundae.
All in all, it could be argued that the hack wasn’t all that bad. It appears to have had no real affect on people who enjoy the PSN, or any other network. Digital distribution is growing, people are still playing online and the games on PSN are getting better and better. Happy times indeed.

This is actually not terribly objectionable...so long as citizenship is very narrowly defined to include only those persons who substantially contribute to the sovereignty of the nation by provision of its fundamental needs. But I find such a narrow definition of citizenship to be unsatisfactory and thus would prefer a society in which nearly everyone can be a citizen but where the laws are structured such that those who make significant contributions to the welfare of society are better protected than those who detract from the welfare of society. This may not be what the foregoing freedom means...but it is hard to say what else it might mean. The principle of the Rule of Law helps to protect and ensure freedom (though not equally, the freedom of some need and receive little protection from the Rule of Law, the freedom of others much), but that is evidently not what is meant here. If Rule of Law is applied equally, some will be more protected than others (for instance, laws against murder tend to protect the less physically violent more than they protect those prone to such violence). Anything that would protect everyone equally would have to be applied unequally, and would not be the Rule of Law.

Wow. I didn’t know my blog reached 10 000 views. I know they mostly come from the post I wrote out of my interest (related to popular persons/things, e.g. Jen or the K-pendant) instead of the random stories of my life, but it’s still a number to be happy about. It used to not be something to be noticed because I used to receive much more views on my long-gone Yahoo 360° blog. It’s good for a change.

The rhyme about poison ivy (“Leaves of three / Let it be”) provided the inspiration for the pattern name.

I realize that my post yesterday may have been kind of a downer. But, the fact is, having to move mid-tour, my son’s school issues, and my crazy cat aren’t the fault of the Viennese. (Well the having to move might be, a little bit. See air conditioning, above.) In general, we are quite happy here.

2. Focus on the demand side. For human trafficking and CSE especially, Aashika states that the source of demand for exploited victims is mostly comprised of men, ranging usually from ages 18-25. Since these men are the ones who are most likely to buy sex, it is crucial to target them when seeking to raise awareness about these issues. Aashika believes that it is important to instill the mindset that “men shouldn’t resort to violence or buy sex.” And on top of that, men must learn to understand that consent can’t be bought.

The rationalization of Christianity could draw to it many more adherents from among the cognitive elite. This would amplify religion’s function as a damper of transcendence on the lucky few who are usually prone to narcissism, disdain for the little people and hubris. And hubris kills and destroys, as the Greeks knew so well but our midgets don’t. At the least, they are guilty — all of them, everywhere — of what Nicholas Nassim Taleb calls “epistemic arrogance.”

If you've followed me over my career, you have probably seen book marketing that ranges from cold cash purchases to downright gimmicks. I've had a lot of fun, given away a ton of free books, more than 30 Kindles and Kindle Fires, thousands of dollars in gift cards, and sold a lot of books and met tens of thousands of readers. Some of my stunts include a giveaway of three of my permanent teeth to promote They Hunger, chances to be drawn as a character in my comic books, paying book bloggers 15 percent of my income to promote my books, casting actors for the parts in the fantasy movie versions of my books, and hosting a paranormal conference for the primary purpose of inspiring my novel.
And as for those early warning signs of crazification I was looking for? Well, they’re mostly not actually present, which is OK by me. There’s a modest amount of institutionalized sexism which is somewhat unavoidable given the subject matter, since any pastiche or parody of Howard has to engage or mimic his fairly loathsome gender issues (mercifully steering clear of his equally loathsome racial essentialism). There’s a certain amount of skeeviness in the handling of Red Sophia, but since her schtick basically boils down to, “ha ha, those womenfolk, always yammering and driving the men around them crazy”, it’s well-trod ground already pretty well established by newspaper comics, so I might give Sim a tentative pass here.

As of this morning I am exactly 7 months along. I have to say that I never thought that this day would come. My dream for so many years was to have a baby. The fact that this is actually happening and that we are going to have not one but two children at the end of this is surreal.
It was... I cannot even describe how beautiful and gasp-inducing and huge and magnificent the view of the city was. The longer you walk across the bride the larger the city becomes, seeping like a spilled glass of humanity, the empire state building slighting outpacing the rest, the hudson slowly unraveling in twinkling lights, the statue of liberty winking just in front of a bend.

There are no limitations to the goods in the application and cited registration, and so it is presumed that they move in all normal channels for the respective goods.

And this concludes my idea of what a geeky, technology, landmark tour of Silicon Valley should include.

So I obviously have lots of spare time on my hands considering there is a huge lack of activity taking place at the moment. In that time I love to listen to music and I’m a massive fan of the late Jeff Buckley, I’ll apologise now to those of you who think I go on about him a little too much but after all he is my muse. I do have a broader range of interest when it comes to music, my favourite artists include, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty, The Cure, Talking Heads, Ryan Adams, Counting Crows, Joni Mitchell, Nick Drake and more recently Passion Pit, Foster the People, Group Love and much more. I tend to listen to an album a day, usually late afternoon after I’ve taken the dog out, I’ll go for a lie down to get some pain relief and try to fill my mind with positive thoughts.

Mick Fitzgerald was his long-time stable jockey until retirement in 2008, when Barry Geraghty took over. Geraghty splits his time between Britain and his home in Ireland, and has continued in as successful a vein as his predecessor. Henderson had his best ever total of 153 winners in the 2010/11 campaign, which saw Long Run develop into Britain’s best chaser, and accrued just over £2.2 million in prize money, another personal best, as he finished runner-up in the trainers’ championship (decided on prize money) for a third successive season. He celebrated his 2,000th Jump winner when Punchestowns triumphed in a graduation chase at Kempton on February 11, 2011. This season has already yielded Grade One success courtesy of Binocular in the William Hill Christmas Hurdle at Kempton Park on Boxing Day, while Riverside Theatre landed a repeat victory in the Grade One Betfair Ascot Chase in February on his seasonal reappearance.

The clinical efficacy of a herbomineral formulation containing roots of Withania somnifera, the stem of Boswellia serrata, rhizomes of Curcuma longa and a zinc complex (Articulin-F), was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over study in patients with osteoarthritis. After a one-month single blind run-in period, 42 patients with osteoarthritis were randomly allocated to receive either a drug treatment or a matching placebo for a period of three months. After a 15-day wash-out period the patients were transferred to the other treatment for a further period of three months. Clinical efficacy was evaluated every fortnight on the basis of severity of pain, morning stiffness, Ritchie articular index, joint score, disability score and grip strength. Other parameters like erythrocyte sedimentation rate and radiological examination were carried out on a monthly basis. Treatment with the herbomineral formulation produced a significant drop in severity of pain (P less than 0.001) and disability score (P less than 0.05). Radiological assessment, however, did not show any significant changes in both the groups. Side effects observed with this formulation did not necessitate withdrawal of treatment.

So that’s what Jan Brewer is all about—believing that getting negative mail is as bad as waterboarding, sulking because she wasn’t chosen to attend the White House, and willing to lie for her personal benefit. I’ve skipped all the pieces about her saying that the $10 million given to Arizona for education will go to border security, her cavalier attitude toward dying people by removing them from the state health care, etc., etc. At least she has Sarah Palin for a friend; too bad she doesn’t use her as a model.

If using the next day, be sure to re-whisk.

My name is Laura Mozer Davis, and I was born over half a century ago. My life’s journey has included raising three children as a single parent while caring for my parents who both became disabled during the last 10 years of their lives. Now that my children are grown and my parents have passed into the next part of their journey, I finally have time for me to grow as a person, not as just a care-giver. What I am learning, however, is that my destiny is to always be a care-giver. When I started writing for The Daily Sisterhood blog, I realized that I was to continue my care-giving through my writing. If my words help even just one person find either solace or joy, I know my life continues to have meaning.

This school, my house, and the park are the three elements that mainly make up my neighborhood. I still live in the same place, which is unfortunate because i like to travel, but that’s okay because i like my house. It’s small for the seven people who live in it, but it’s very comforting to me. I like being home just as much as travelling which is a bit contradictory. Travelling is really fun because though the neighborhood brings memories, it’s not very active. There aren’t a lot of fun people on my block nor and fun events that happen at the park except for during the Summer. Sometimes when walking in the park randomly at night, there might be a movie screening, or some fireworks which always brings a lot of people to come watch. The loud exploding of fireworks can be heard from anywhere in the neighborhood that I described. I didn’t like it very much at first because i couldn’t see the fireworks from my window, but eventually grew happy knowing that other people could. I smile when other people are happy.

We rocked until 3am, but could easily have gone for more. As most of the Accidental friends headed back to their homes in South-West London, I alone headed up the road towards North London. Home was a mere ten minutes away and as I attempted to hail a cab, my ears ringing from dancing a little too close to the speakers, I looked around me at Camden; the streets I travel through every day, the places I do my shopping, my part of London. In my shiny leggings, with my vast, fluorescent earrings and heavy make-up, I did not look all that out of place amidst the late-night revellers and goths who wander the streets whatever time of day it is here. For a rock fan there are few places better to be in this city than Camden. And then I did the most rock and roll thing ever; I hopped on the night-bus, with the drunk and those who work night-shifts, and rode home.

I always encounter this problem when I am shopping for Christmas presents - I can find a hundred and one things that I would love to find in my very own Christmas stocking, but you will be very glad to hear that I am quite strict with myself, and resolve to allow myself just one modest present (although often I don't even have the decency to wait until the big day to open it).
3. Briefly pause to assess the task at hand. This is no different for us than it is for a nurse or doctor who works triage in an emergency room. When individuals enter that emergency room, the medical staff works to promptly and appropriately assess each and every situation that presents itself. Well, in lieu of an emergency room, my friends, we find ourselves performing “legal triage.” Merriam-Webster defines “triage” as:
In late 1961, Cline was back in the studio to record songs for her upcoming album in 1962. One of the first songs recorded in late 1961 was the song “She’s Got You“, written by Hank Cochran, who pitched the song over the phone to Cline. It was one of the few songs Cline enjoyed recording. The song was released as a single in January 1962, and soon was another country pop crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the country chart again (her second and last chart-topper), No. 14 on the pop charts, and No. 3 on the adult contemporary charts (originally called “Easy Listening”). It would be Cline’s last Top 40 Pop hit.

He pulled out all sorts of goodies including a 3 year old barley wine, a beer he was calling "Half Beer" which was Flanders Red blended with Cherries, and a beer I think he is calling "Shekar" (a sour spice strong blonde ale fermented with a "White Wine Grape") all of which were quite remarkable. Then he started pulling samples from the tanks in the brewery. There we tasted some truly special beers like his wonderful Apricot Flanders and very tasty and well balanced blended that I can't remember the name of (I must have been drinking). I think it might have been called P’Quad. (Edit: Vlad the Imp Aler.)

Sealing a deal in one day of negotiations would be sterling work by Arsenal and entirely surprising. Arsène said he wanted this resolved before the European Championships which was always a tight deadline, made seemingly impossible by holding this meeting less than twenty-four hours before van Persie joins the Oranje on their quest for glory this summer. Unless of course the outcome is already decided which would tie in with the seeming disinterest of the captain in money. A tawdry subject or posturing, clever manoeuvering having seen the derision and disdain served on Samir Nasri and to a lesser extent Cesc Fabregas last summer?
And serving an "untraditional" wedding dessert doesn't mean you have to forgo the wedding cake completely. Have your caterer or baker make a small three-tiered wedding cake for you to cut before the dessert course. It will make a great photo-op and instead of serving it at your reception you can have each tier frozen to enjoy on your wedding anniversary.
The Attorney General, the Ohio Ethics Commission, Inspector General, and Secretary of State, have all previously ignored the allegations and all declined to take any action citing their lack of jurisdiction and/or precedent.

Rwanda exported “sexual terrorism” to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), mostly in the late 1990s, when the chase and revenge killings of the perpetrators of the 1994 genocide turned into a full-scale counter-genocide of Hutu refugees with more than 230,000 victims.

After a duke’s betrayal, the resilient Sarah Forrester reinvents herself as the Golden Lady: society’s leading light, the beautiful and witty life of the party. It’s all a façade of course-one that protects her from another intimate disloyalty. When her old friend, Lieutenant Jackson Fletcher, returns to London, he is determined to rediscover the true and trusting Sarah he once knew. It’ll take more than a kiss and a promise. It might even call for an innocent and necessary deception.

Oh, one other thing - Kat only exists in my mind. She's a fictitious character I've been working with for years now in my attempt to complete a mystery/amateur sleuth novel that refuses to get out of my head. I have a whole list of unique (some might even say flat, one-dimensional, and stereotypical) characters to work with but my plots still seem to fall short. I've written this thing in first-person, third-person, past-tense, present-tense, you name it. I always seem to peter out by about thirty thousand words.
We had been together for 8 years since. He had proposed 4 times, once every year since our 4th year together, and I rejected everytime. I feared that things would change, that the perfect dynamics that we had in the relationship would topple and fail. My family warned me that I would lose him. I told them that if he did love me the way he did, he would understand. They only replied that his family would probably be saying the same thing to him, and it would not end well.
My wife and I accompanied a friend to a recent hospitalization for some tests he was having. We helped him recall his family’s health history for the admissions official.

In my option the HUGE problem we have in our Cities and Suburbs is the lack of facilities for teenagers? ? Yes were in a recession now and there is not a whole lot the government can do but this has been going on long before this recession happened so what was wrong with the government doing something about it then. There have been many complaints that there are not enough for young people to do and it has been up for discussion in many Comhairlé (A Parliment for the Youth of Ireland) . Its not just a problem that teens in Cork City face this problem is all over Ireland and the government is doing very little to deal with it.

When I was a child growing up in Toronto, Ontario, it was always one of my biggest thrills to visit Casa Loma. What is more exciting and magical than walking the halls of an old castle. Now, this is not an ancient castle like you would find in Europe, but it is beautiful all the same.

Following his election Obama was being either ignorant or deliberately lying when he told a November 2008 Governor’s Global Climate Summit in Los Angeles that “Few challenges facing America—and the world—are more urgent than combating climate change. The science is beyond dispute and the facts are clear. Sea levels are rising. Coastlines are shrinking. We’ve seen record drought, spreading famine and storms that are growing stronger with each passing hurricane season.”

Often Christians are accused of being “preachy” and “judgmental”, because the “God-detector” (conscience) built into their family, friends, and acquaintances is active and is sending out beeps and chirps of conviction directly from God’s Spirit into their hearts: the believer gets the bad rap, because he or she is there in plain sight. It seems to be human nature to blame someone else when we’re uncomfortable – but that’s another blog.

Bek didn’t understand how I figured out the puzzle, nor did she understand how I was able to know exactly what to do with the items the game gave to me.

It wasn’t a skill she wished to have nor cared to.

I woke today as though from a black cloud. Maybe my mother is burning candles on behalf of my soul on some alter a thousand miles to the East. Maybe it's the Vit C packet Ilya gave me that I drank before bed. Or perhaps it is the prayers I mumbled under my breath all night until I fell asleep. What ever did it, I feel like I am back inside of my own eyes looking out onto the world. It's so painful to lose that gentleness of self, that natural trust in the unfolding of things. I'm not sure what took over and possessed me - my fever, my cough, my stress, some demon from my past or a complex triggered without my even knowing it - but it has loosened its grip and I can breath again, despite the pressure of infection in my lungs.

One of my favourite business books is Robert Cialdini's 'Influence - the Psychology of Persuasion'. There are many books on how to apply influence but this book is fun to read, thanks to many anecdotes and case studies. It'll leave the hairs standing up on your neck as you fully realise just how manipulative the marketing process can be. Cialdini identifies a number of principles - weapons of influence - that you will recognise. The little skit above attempts to use these in the context of promoting an ebook, but I'm going to expand upon eight identified weapons of influence in the context of social network marketing (blog, Twitter, Facebook etc.)

As evening falls, the temple is buzzing with activity. People gather around the main chambers to see one of the daily and also important rituals of the temple. Every evening at bed time, the idols are placed inside Sundereshwara’s bedchamber. This procession is accompanied by music, devotees, and priests and as they walk towards the chambers to consummate their marriage. Each and every detail is taken care off…even the nose-ring of the Goddess is taken off, so that the Lord is not accidentally hurt during their celestial lovemaking!
I am a big fan of both the “It Gets Better” Campaign and the “Dear 16 Year Old Me” Melanoma Awareness Campaign. I wish that young people would heed the advice of the more experienced generations, and I get unrealistically annoyed when they don’t (because, after all, did I give much credence to what the older generations told ME? Not so much.) It is so true that everything is clearer in hindsight and as much as I’d like to just MAKE the younger generations CARE about their decisions and how it might affect them in the future, it isn’t possible. I like that these campaigns are attempting to give voice to those issues generally wrapped up in the adage: “I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger.”

Now, since I’m on this Freud “work and love” kick, (It’s all about work and love.) I’m wondering if the same is true of work. I’m wondering if scientists can do a study for me – where clinicians observe office workers and the frequency of bathroom trips made in conjunction with time spent in said bathroom. My educated guess says that those who go to the bathroom most and spend the longest duration of time in there will be the same people who score high on the, “I feckin’ hate my job” test. (Either that or they have a urinary tract infection.)

Zygmunt Bauman characterised the riots as acts of ‘defective and disqualified consumers’: more than anything else, they were a manifestation of a consumerist desire violently enacted when unable to realise itself in the ‘proper’ way – by shopping. As such, they also contain a moment of genuine protest, in the form of an ironic response to consumerist ideology: ‘You call on us to consume while simultaneously depriving us of the means to do it properly – so here we are doing it the only way we can!’ The riots are a demonstration of the material force of ideology – so much, perhaps, for the ‘post-ideological society’. From a revolutionary point of view, the problem with the riots is not the violence as such, but the fact that the violence is not truly self-assertive. It is impotent rage and despair masked as a display of force; it is envy masked as triumphant carnival.
The first day we moseyed out to see the Today show and scarf down pain chocolat from Bouchon Bakery. While I enjoyed every crumb of my breakfast, Kellen threw up his delicious carrot muffin all over the front of his outfit, Hank's pants and my hands. We pretended it didn't happen and continued on... We walked down 5th Avenue, awed at the Cathedrals, and ultimately ended up at FAO Schwartz. Despite being 100 degrees inside, we spent hours in there! Hank and Kellen played with every toy while I stood amazed by the expensive strollers and other products I've only ever seen online. It was heaven for everyone--that never happens!

"You have to go to all the colors!" So I did. Violet then suggested that the artist wanted us to fill in all the white parts. We agreed it would be a good art project to make one of these, all white, for the kids to color in. No one, however, seemed to think it would make much of a story.

Sure enough, I heard a bunch of squawking in the middle of the night and rushed out. I saw a commotion over by the greenhouse, and thought I'd shine my light on a chicken. Nope, it was the raccoon I saw in my beam. I found Squawk, and two piles of feathers the raccoon had ripped off her. She didn't seem to have any scratches or blood, though, so I hoped she was ok. I put her into the coop, and the next morning Penny showed up, just fine.

After the first wave of confusion and doubt, I felt nothing but pride and relief. Pride that my daughter had done it without spilling grape juice all over herself, that she knew what to do at all, that she had done it, and that I knew she knew exactly how important it was. Relief that no lightning had come down and incinerated us all. Relief that another barrier rooted in my childhood keeping me from truly understanding God had been broken down. I hadn’t even known it was there until it was gone.
The trap even the most successful writers fall into when describing a scene is to simply list the objects in a room or landscape, and a few adjectives thrown about for color or texture do not make the description any more interesting. Writers often cheat by pretending to see the scene through the character’s eyes, but it still comes down to being nothing more than a list.
But one day there was an awful storm and a tree blew down and "Beauty" went crashing into it then "Pride" somehow derailed or something then suddenly there was this king and he needed to get back home immediately for important matters of state and there was only one little train who could get the job done and . . . oh, who cares about plot . . . can we just admire the gorgeous gouaches from the team of Lewitt and Him?

Newsroom Dialogue for Proud Professionals
There are untrusting parents who are so anxious for their children, that while they live they starve their bodies and hazard their souls to leave their children wealthy. In their folly, they fear leaving their children miserable; yet such parents take the only course to make them miserable; for they leave them not so much heirs to their goods as to their evils. The good man, on the other hand, is merciful, and shares what he has with the poor. Habits which the secular man thinks shall make his children poor. Trust Christ with your children; Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, and today, and for ever. Grace and peace are from Him who is, and was, and is to come; so glory and honor to Him, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, and to-day, and forever.

Project Pay Day is not a scam. It has earned money for people and is usually easy enough for people to follow.

Lee Harris in his article “Why Isn’t Socialism Dead?” ponders whether Socialism isn’t dead because Socialism can’t die. The Peruvian economist, Hernando de Soto, has argued in his book, The Mystery of Capital, that the failure of the various socialist experiments of the twentieth century has left mankind with only one rational choice about which economic system to go with, namely, capitalism. However, says Harris, “the revolutionary socialist’s life is transformed because he accepts the myth that one day socialism will triumph, and justice for all will prevail.” Thus there is “an...analogy between religion and the revolutionary Socialism which aims at the apprenticeship, preparation, and even the reconstruction of the individual — a gigantic task.” “It may well be that socialism isn’t dead because socialism cannot die. Who doesn’t want to see the wicked and the arrogant put in their place? Who among the downtrodden and the dispossessed can fail to be stirred by the promise of a world in which all men are equal, and each has what he needs?”
One of the great things about the Wearability Wednesday series is that they aren’t photoshoots per se; they are full of photos taken on the spur of the moment while somewhere else for a different purpose. This means you haven’t always dressed with photos in mind, and need to come up with some creative ways of hiding the fact that you weren’t fully prepared. On that particular day, we were showing a family friend around one of our favourite National Trust properties, Cliveden, and decided to take a few photos. This photo worked best. By raising the shoulders, it accentuated the line of the “tangled yoke” part of the sweater, and covered up the green. By being at an angle to the sun, the green that isn’t covered up by Mom’s hair, is in the shadows so appears to be significantly less green. We also kept the sweater buttoned all the way up to hide as much of the shirt as possible!
Just because it’s wrapped in Bible-talk doesn’t mean it originates from God or that it was birthed in tender love for your heart.
These three stories may strike some as rather harsh, but keep in mind these are, as the title suggests traditional folk tales and so are intended to teach rather harsh lessons for life. The stories are Malawian folk stories as told to the artist by students he was teaching in Malawi. Much like the original Grimms fairy tales these are not the happy ever after stories you may expect. They are entertaining and I think interesting in some of the common themes that appear in stories from other parts of the world.

As I sit here with my first coffee of 2012, I’m full of hope. This always happens to me at the start of a new year. My head tells me it’s silly and yet I embrace those first few days of every new year as a clean slate of sorts and eagerly anticipate what lies ahead. And this year in particular, it’s more exciting than any recent year.
Cairo’s Tahrir Square is probably the most over exaggerated focal point of the media’s highly commercialized portrayal of the Arab Spring. The right-leaning media has repackaged it as a cesspool of anti-Western Islamism, spearheaded by the conservative Muslim Brotherhood. Many liberal outlets, on the other hand, have dressed it as a curious grab box of Velvet Revolution meets Mark Zuckerberg and social media. Neither is entirely true, but neither is entirely false either. It would be much more accurate to say that, in post-Mubarak Egypt, there is no unified spirit of Tahrir—it is an ideological battleground for the future of an economically and politically shattered country. My own personal estimation is that the Islamists have the upper hand right now—the Salafists and the Muslim Brotherhood are the only ones still filling the streets—which does not bode well for the longevity of Egyptian democracy.
Whenever Aunt Lucy was at my house for dinner, I was sure to serve a broccoli dish.

The rules for selecting delegates vary from state to state — in the ones that assign delegates only after the primary, our ABO strategy may need to be modified. Caucus rules are particularly convoluted.
Amanzi Awethu! is about two South African's, Murray Beaumont & Alex Antrobus, cycling from South Africa to the top of Lake Victoria unsupported. Our journey is as much an opportunity to explore and interact with Africa’s wealth of people, cultures and places and it is a chance to assist with one of Africa’s biggest problems – Water. With this in mind the two of us will be heading North in early February 2012. Our route will take us from South Africa through Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda and Kenya before flying home. We will be traveling on highways and remote byways to reach our destination but our main interest will be in the rivers, watercourses, boreholes and wells along the way. The aim of this is to add impetus to our charity of choice, The Water Project*. The Water Project is an NGO which is installing water facilities in rural Africa in an attempt to alleviate the health, economic and developmental strains that an inadequate supply of water places on communities. We hope to raise US $15 000.00 for the Water Project which will cover the costs of sinking two wells. On route we hope to visit existing wells that The Water Project has installed and visit shortlisted sights for further wells. The aim of this is to illustrate what an adequate water supply can provide to communities and facilitate a relationship between donors and the communities that will likely receive the benefits or their donations. During our trip we hope to share our experiences and adventures through this blog, our website (www.amanziawethu.org) , our facebook page (www.facebook.com/amanziawethu) and our twitter page (www.twitter.com/amanzi_awethu). We look forward to sharing with you all soon! Siyabonga umhlobo wam (We Thank-you) Amanzi Awethu! Murray Beaumont & Alex Antrobus

And she nods and runs off with her friends. And he whistles as he wraps his canvases in butcher paper and carries them all to the basement apartment where he lives. He whistles while he squirts paint from a tube onto a palette made from a hammered tin can, and dabs a big camel brush into it. It’s more like nine days when he’s done, but he brings it with him on the tenth wrapped in a piece of green cloth.
Inshore fishing reports include plenty of sea mullets and some 17″ gray trout. Offshore reports include wahoo and triggerfish.
Then a few days later, a miracle happened! I was sweeping the dining room and Brett was wiping off the table, and he said, "I hate that china cabinet." I think he was so confused when I started grinning. He doesn't hate the cookie monster color with my passion, but he also doesn't like it. What he hates is the flowery paper backing. And I honestly can't blame him. It's just way, way, way too much. Way too much.

The first voyage took him to Africa, the Gold Coast, where he found work as a mine engineer, but then left, along with three other adventurers, to seek gold in the jungles of the Congo, -one by one, the others sickened, John nursed them, then buried them, the african bearers killed and ate the dog. John slept with a gun in his hand, fearing he was to be next on the menu. One night the drums sounded through the jungle, and in the morning, the bearers were gone. John was never sure what time had elapsed before the day he staggered into a native village, delirious with fever, nor how long it was that the villagers nursed him, but by the time he was fit, he spoke their language. With their craftsmen he learned to work the little gold he had found, and from a part of it he made a ring, in the shape of two clasped hands, to send to Selina, before taking ship again, south to Australia.

This shot shows a closer view of the top of the tower and the bells. I showed one of the bells in a previous Photo Oven article so you can guess the size of this thing. The many lines and dirt really come out against the blue sky. With film you have a big gradient of light levels so you can still get details in the foreground while shooting against a bright background as in this picture. As you can see from the raw image I did not do that much to this one. I tried to keep it as natural as I could. It was a bit hard to get the white balance correct because some parts of the tower are lighter than others and thus tend to be pinker in tone. But I think I did a good job with this one and the angle I choose.

We can look through glasses of despair (not synonymous with irony or sarcasm), we can look through rose-tinted glasses, or we can see the truth, which is somewhere in between the two, and often unpleasant. Or we can interchange them. A despairing heart is often a heart ferociously seeking answers and hope, a heart of contentment not so much. Despair can act as a catalyst towards finding joy.

Definitely give Smashwords a try, too. It’s free, and they have great tools for vetting your work so that it will display correctly in e-readers. They will also distribute to just about everyone (silverbacks excepted for the most part). I also recommend publishing a trade paperback edition of your book. It adds credibility, and there are still 14 people out there without e-readers. You want to sell to them.

This rant really serves no purpose, but if you see a dearth of new copy here, you'll know why. I need to write. I always have, but right now, I've neither the stamina nor the inspiration to do much beyond things I've already done in advance. I have the two discs of the international version of John Woo's Red Cliff sitting on my DVD player. Who knows how long it will take me to get to that or what kind of disservice it will do to the film since there is no practical way for me to watch it in one sitting.
Downfall presents the story of how handwritten notes from the disputed SSP executive meeting of 9 November came to the attention of the police, once the 2006 defamation trial had ended: “Barbara Scott, the SSP minutes secretary, was also on a mission. One way of clearing her name would be to track down the original handwritten notes. They would reveal more detail about what had been said at that now-infamous meeting. When she found the notes she marched into the headquarters of Lothian and Borders Police to hand over this new piece of evidence.”
Perhaps she has just been wrongly advised and is simply not aware that the view she is expounding has been very severely criticised in the medical literature. If so we should not question her integrity.

Pregnancy: With Evelyn I was sick, I had carpal tunnel that made my hand feel like it was on fire for 6 months, I had gestational diabetes, and I swelled up like a sponge in a bathtub. With Mikey I had no complaints, until I was blind-sighted by an inguinal hernia at the beginning of my 3rd trimester. With Evelyn I read books, took classes, sang to her, sewed for her, made up a nursery, painted furniture, and called her by name for months. With Mikey I did none of that until I started sewing some things about a month before he was born.
stories and I loved that film. He portrayed a very sweet and gentle Hans Christian Andersen. My parents bought me the record which I listened to over and over again. I knew all the songs – still do. “Oh, Thumbelina, Thumbelina, tiny little thing. Thumbelina dance, Thumbelina sing. Oh Thumbelina what’s the difference if you’re very small? When your heart is full of love you’re nine feet tall.” The man who sang that looked to me to be full of love himself.

For all of his faults, Wilke is clearly the most perceptive teen on the show. He is surprised when he finds out Toby didn’t go to the tournament, having heard that Simone had someone in her room. His suspicions are already on alert, and then they are definitively confirmed when he accidentally picks up Simone’s phone. It seems she and Emmett, beyond his request to for her to leave (which she did try), continued texting admitting their mistake and desire to keep it a secret. Wilke confronts Simone, who begs for his silence. He’s torn, since Toby is his best friend and Bay is clearly like a sister. But for the time being, he keeps his mouth shut.

So, I’m probably going to get in trouble after I publish this post (what am I five?)…and no, I don’t mean “you didn’t eat your broccoli and so you don’t get dessert” or “you weren’t supposed to peek at your Christmas presents and now you’re grounded” or “you talked back to me and now you’re getting spanked” (yes, that was the extent of trouble in my childhood….I was sheltered, okay?).

And for those of you who have never seen Gilmore Girls, the main character is quoted as saying this about her mother (Emily): “Well, I consider what my mother would do in a given situation, then I dial it back, and I have what Mussolini would do, then I dial it back, and I have what Stalin would do, and then I dial that back and then it starts approaching what a sane person would do.”
Our favorite RV park in Astoria is Lewis and Clark Golf and RV Resort, just south of town. It's a nice park, but even better, it's one of our 1/2 price Camp Club USA parks. We are staying for three nights, and the price for a premium (golf course frontage) full-hookup site is $22.50 per night--a little higher than our $6 Washington State Parks, but not too bad, especially since there's a lot to see and do in Astoria. We also paid $2 per night for WIFI, which used to be included in the price.
The most obvious traits of the psychopath are charisma, charm and a grandiose sense of self-worth, all somewhat positive traits. Many people actually like and are attracted to psychopaths whom they have just met, only to discover conning, manipulation and deceit—the dark side of this disorder—down the line. Unfortunately, in business coaching situations, it is quite common to find a blend of these traits among executive clients—in the form of self-confidence, assertiveness and influence skills—and to misinterpret them.

The bizarre current day argument that singers who don’t also write songs are somehow lesser than other singers is very strange. We don’t expect opera singers to write the operas and we don’t expect actors to write the screenplays. Most singers do not write songs or at least, not the majority of the songs they perform.
I am so thankful for the instant friends and helpers we made. There were members of Tiffany's family who I felt as if I knew already. The visiting teachers of Tiffany's mom volunteer to help us in the kitchen, they were amazing! I am so grateful for all their help and the sweet spirit around them.

The morning of Dec. 19 started like a normal Monday for the Korean staff at the Hae Dang Hwa restaurant in Beijing. The greeting staff welcomed hungry customers at the front door, the chefs began prepping their fine selection of kimchi and other Korean dishes and the waitresses and waiters began taking down orders for their guests. All of that changed when a China Daily reporter mentioned in a conversation with a waitress that Kim Jong-Il, the head of state for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK), had died that morning of a heart attack. In minutes, the entire Korean staff – from the waiters to the chefs in the kitchen – broke down in tears and, after apologizing to the customers, closed the restaurant early for the day so they could grieve the national tragedy together.
I do agree with one aspect of LZG's article. If my kids are upset and clearly disturbing the peace in what would otherwise be a quiet place, I will remove my them when possible.

The rapid construction of the Empire State Building in a year's time during the Great Depression made a statement about the ability of a nation to do great things even in its darkest hour. The slow pace, the perpetual redesigns and the bland final product of One World Trade Center make the opposite statement. A reminder that inept and timid leadership can rob a nation of its exceptionalism.

A story is like a dance. It takes at least two people to make it come to life, the one who does the telling and the one who does the listening. Sometimes the roles are reversed, and the giver becomes the taker. We both do the talking, we both listen, and even the silences become loaded. From a small number of perfectly ordinary words a tapestry takes shape, suggestive of a dream, but close enough to a reality which, more often than not, remains elusive. It is a feat of mutual trust, of mutual imagining. What matters is whether or not we can believe each other’s voices, and the test of that will lie in the story we make together. It will lie in the pieces of the past that swim into the present. Maybe it is precisely what we don’t remember that will form the kernel of our tale, imparting to it its grain of truth and transforming memories into mythology.
Last weekend we purchased a Troy Built tiller for our new gardening venture here at the Savvy homestead. Yep, I guess it is my Mother's Day gift and his Father's Day gift.

This is a Bailey Built!

It was 1960 and meteorologist Edward Lorenz was working in his lab. He was entering data into his computer in the hope of modeling weather patterns when he stumbled upon a theory that is known as “The Butterfly Effect.” He was entering wind speed, air pressure and temperature into three separate equations that were linked in a mathematical feedback loop. This equation allowed Lorenz to predict weather patterns.

I am still surprised I missed The Seventh Sign back in the day. It was released in 1988 during my sixth grade year when my class was tormented by a Bob Jones University educated teacher who was obsessed with finding Satanism in anything and everything. Some of the less rigid classmates at our Christian school developed a taste for horror films just to spite her. I could barely get into many slasher flicks, but the constant speculation about the coming apocalypse the BJU trained teachers enjoyed indulging in had me seeking out all sorts of end of the world films, particularly if they were laced with spiritual elements. The Seventh Sign would have been right up my alley at 12. At 34, it is a fun, confusing watch.

The further I sink down, the more I feel right beside him, feel how much, in spite of the differences, our ventures came together, in the unthought and the heartrending. The reason for Beckett’s critical silence after the war is perhaps best expressed when he ends a letter about van Velde: “I am no longer capable of writing about.” Such thought, such writing, is mere relation. The contradiction inherent in making such statements cannot go unnoticed: “To write is impossible but yet impossible enough”. There is also a need to speak. To Thomas MacGreevy he writes of his “feeling of helplessness ... and of speechlessness, and of restlessness also I think, before works of art”.
We can also see the suicides of those in the imperialist occupying armies as politically motivated.The US military has lost more soldiers to suicide in its invasions of Iraq and Afganistan in 2009 and 2010 than it lost in combat. These suicides are just as much the result of political oppression and repression as those of the freedom fighters of the resistance movements they are sent to fight.

For perchance in the Gospel the vineyard is the kingdom of God, that is, the doctrine which is contained in holy Scripture; and a man’s blameless life is the fruit of the vineyard. And the letter of Scripture is the hedge set round the vineyard, that the fruits which are bid in it should not be seen by those who are without. The depth of the oracles of God is the winepress of the vineyard, into which such as have profited in the oracles of God pour out their studies like fruit.

So I get this email from my Daddy, right?? And I'm all feeling guilty because I realize that I have not actually called my parents since .....carry the one......about Christmas....no wait...I might have missed Christmas...well, it's been a while now.... but in my defense, I have to use Skype, and then I have to actually TALK and think of things to say that are not sarcastic and bitter (which is quite difficult for me, you know...) and then (even worse) I'm apparently supposed to LISTEN to what they are saying to me...and sometimes its not about me, so my motivation to listen is impacted negatively. I mean, you know...it's a LOTTA work.

Situated on top of a hill overlooking the city of Bratislava is Slavin (a memorial monument and military cemetery). Here, thousands of Soviet Army soldiers who died during the liberation of the city from Nazi occupation during World War II were buried.

It’s really impressive and has a great view of the entire city.

Today I woke up smiling for the first time in two weeks because yesterday marked the conclusion of a process that in some aspects felt like it lasted longer than this past NFL season. A gamut of emotions swirled during that time as the uncertainty of where Peyton would land grew more frustrating by the minute. I knew the time he took was necessary. He is meticulous with his decisions because he doesn’t want to make the wrong one. He doesn’t want to have regrets. I get that, but it was still frustrating. Of course I never once thought NO ONE would want him. That’s just silly, but patience is not my virtue and just gives my wandering mind more time to come up with horrible scenarios about his future. Sure the questions came from various friends, acquaintances, and co-workers about where I wanted him to end up, and again I did my best to answer them without giving a concrete answer on what I was hoping for. I had selfish reasons for not publicizing my opinions. I knew that if I publicized my choice and it didn’t happen that it would be that much harder to accept, and I didn’t want to add to the emotion unnecessarily. So here it is…staring at the future in Mile High Stadium, and the only way I could be happier is if Peyton was still a Colt. Understand that it’s going to be a very long time, if ever, before I can talk completely and fully about what happened on March 8th because every time I start to talk about it, I get emotional, again. I seem to not have as much trouble talking about the future though because at least that seems promising. But how did we get here, and what has been running through my head in the last two weeks?
I keep track of upcoming schedules for college football as they are announced. Recently, I noticed an oddity. UNLV added a game to its 2012 schedule this week, booking a home contest for September 8 against Northern Arizona. It will round out a 13-game schedule for the Rebels. Allowed? Here is what I found out, which jogged my memory a bit. It isn’t just about creating an opportunity to take program officials, coaches, players, and fans to paradise for a week.
Today was a glorious day so I spent the whole day in the garden. Rain is forcast for tomorrow so it was too good an oppertunity to miss. Tomorrow will be a whole day in the studio and I can't wait......
I had this ridiculously big fibroid in my uterus until last Monday. That's when talented surgeon Jeannine Villella chopped it out of me. For those unfamiliar with these beasts, fibroids are (almost always) benign tumors that may be inside the uterus, attached to the uterine wall, or on a stalk outside the uterus. Mine was attached to the wall, and made my uterus the size of a 4 or 5-month pregnancy. It amazes me that the human body can work with a crazy invader like that taking up so much room.

The purpose that Wimsey finds in life is the result of a hard-won battle with post-war trauma. After his nervous breakdown (as we are told in a postscript to the novel “written” by Wimsey’s uncle), Wimsey turned to detective work as a way of regaining meaning in life. It was not a decision taken lightly; “at the end of every case he had the old nightmares and shell-shock over again.”

It's been quite chaotic at times with 17 of us for dinner each night, but what fun! I wouldn't trade it for anything. Things will settle down before long and I'll be back to my posts. Hard to believe the Summer is going to be Fall before long. Thank you for stopping by and have a wonderful week.

Yes, I'm excited about going back to school again! I'm relieved that it won't take lots of tricky maneuvering between mine and my husband's schedules, just so I can make it to class on time. I'm delighted that this needn't be a decision that will stretch our already-tight family budget, and I'm thrilled that I can have this flexibility and affordability - and still get a quality education through a credible institution.

Instead of being angry or vile, Dratch is understanding and diplomatic. This potentially prickly tale takes up only a little bit of her memoir Girl Walks into a Bar…Comedy Calamities, Dating Disasters, and a Midlife Miracle. Instead of being a first-hand account of the backstage of SNL, Dratch’s book deals primarily with her love life and eventual pregnancy. Because of this, Dratch’s book has the unintended consequence of being rather dull.

However we, the people, are also to blame for not knowing enough about the Constitution to challenge the unconstitutional spending that has long gone on. We’ve allowed ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security and have allowed someone else (the politicians) to play the ‘expert’ and this is the result. The Constitution was not designed to create a mega government that is all things to all people and supports cradle to grave care. I don’t know about you, but I can barely afford gas for my car, and I surely can’t afford to continue to support the government’s spending of my income. I give to charity on my own.

LÄPPLE: In general the reception was critical. There were no objections on the content of the dogma, but on the reasonableness of going as far as dogmatization.

One of the next important innovations came when Santini decided to add a dash of lemon juice to the basic cocktail framework. Until then, cocktails had never contained citrus juice. Sours, fixes and daisies--all prevalent during the mid-nineteenth century--certainly contained citrus, but not the cocktail. And it was this move from a lemon twist to a quarter ounce of lemon juice that changed the face of cocktails.

When I was younger I used to tell my parents whenever we’d be watching whatever awards show that I was going to win that Grammy/Oscar/Emmy/whatever one day. If we were watching sports, I’d proclaim I was going to win the gold medal in whatever Olympic event was on. Sometimes I still believe I could win whatever reality show I happen to be watching at the time (I’m looking at you $1 million on Amazing Race and mirror ball trophy on Dancing with the Stars).
Though the setting is not fully developed, I would love to run both miniatures games and role-playing games in it. It's an excuse to use all sorts of wild ideas and to buy small numbers of miniatures of all kinds. It also allows me to do quite a bit of conversion and modelling work if I get that far. I have a few miniatures that would make suitable denizens such as some of Reaper Miniatures' reptilian faction for their Warlord game. I also have some Warhammer Fantasy plastic orcs that i converted to some sort of strange beastmen (below).

How do you save a drowning person? Lifeguards experience this when someone is floundering in the water. Sometimes they wait, observing the victim and when all strength is gone, and they are unable to fight back, they jump in to the rescue. At such a stage the drowning person gives up and the rescuer takes over.
Last year I was asked to serve on a grant investment committee for United Way of Larimer County. It has been one of the most eye-opening experiences of my life. During these last several months I have seen over thirty presentations from a wide range of non-profit organizations. They include food banks, homeless shelters, community medical centers, and much more. I had no idea about the amount of people who are in poverty, abused, and in need of basic medical services. We all can easily forget how much we all have and how accessible most basic services are to us.

He feels that if we work with him individually that we'll see an improvement. He suggested taking him aside from her and working with him on his sounds. After our appointment we busted out the flash cards and surprisingly he said "pig" when he saw the animal. Although he's still lacking the "g" at the end, he at least made an effort. We've also been diligent at correcting Arabella when she tries to answer questions specifically directed to Evan. We've seen a vast improvement since our appointment. We are getting more beginning word sounds. I've even been able to get him to say "Yes" (minus the "s") when I ask yes or not questions. It's almost hilarious to hear Adam or I talk to him.

Everyone has a public face to fit into the “village” they live in, and my public face is not very different from my private face, so I tend to feel that I don't fit in much of the time because I am not hiding my differences. As I read Eli Gerzon’s post (thanks Eli!) I realized that there are probably many unschoolers who feel the same way, especially if unschooling is not their only difference. They unschool, but that's just a word to most people who aren't doing it, not a philosophy. If someone asks what unschooling is, you may start telling them about your philosophy of life if you want to explain unschooling adequately. You can say your children learn at home without a curriculuum, and many people don't want to hear more than that, but if you elaborate you start talking about your values. You talk about respecting children and trusting that they will learn what they need to. That is a foreign concept to most people, and it may make them uncomfortable because they don't trust their children, and they may feel judged by you. If you say you talk with your teens, they may feel guilty that their teens don't talk to them. Other unschoolers don't need these values explained, they share them.

I have been in Pennsylvania for the last week. It was 70 degrees and sunny for a few days. I work outdoors, and I have been disc golfing twice since I got here. After a few days I noticed something. My skin showed the effects of the sun, it was a shade of pink I hadn't seen in a while.

A modern day fable, hung, as any modern-day fable must (and should) be, on a sturdy frame of logic, reason, and science, the book provides, on one level, a fascinating case study in animal/human behaviour, as Pi, relying only on his own knowledge of big cat psychology, gleaned mostly from his personal observations at the zoo, devises an ingenious program of negative conditioning which allows him to dominate his dangerous shipmate, and thus to survive.
But, I did find these two amazing vintage lamps the other day for only $12. I have been looking for lamps because all of ours have broken. I never find quirky/cool lamps in a pair that actually work at a thrift store.... and these lamps are definitely pretty quirky.

Do you want to see something powerful happen – fasting can be a key to having it happen. Isaiah 58:6 says this; “Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen the bonds of wickedness, To undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free And break every yoke?” Let me ask you – do you have bonds of wickedness in your life that needs to be broken? Do you have things in life that are weighing you down? Do you feel oppressed and need to break free? Fasting is one of the ways that the Lord tells us that these things are broken. I encourage you to fast for a spiritual breakthrough because fasting can a part of encountering God.

And, actually, that's rather true. Because, as I sat watching TV last night, I had an epiphany during Holby City. Just sitting there, thinking rationally about everything, I came up with some great ideas for future books, and there's nothing better, as a writer, to know that, once you've finished one book, there's an idea for another one just sitting there waiting to be worked on. I have an idea for a summer romance, and an idea for a fun, Christmas novel that I hope to have ready to put out there next November/December. So, rather than the events of yesterday knocking me - like I kind-of led people to believe with that shouldn't've-been-written-blog-post - they've actually made me come back fighting, determined to make a success of this writing of journey of mine, if it kills me! Although, I rather hope it doesn't, because I've got a lot of plans...
One last note- and I am pretty sad about this:
Oh, and as for the film's content, I offer this as criticism: For those who think Sam Mendes and Todd Field have cornered the market artistically in the sick-soul-of-suburbia melodrama, I strongly suggest finding a copy of the Criterion DVD of Bigger Than Life and seeing how such a melodrama can be done in a way that is harsh yet compassionate, not snarky and condescending. And yes, it's also more visually distinguished than any of those films (Mendes may have a taste for slick visual extravagance, but none of his images in American Beauty and Revolutionary Road come close to the soulful expression of Ray's).

Good news, though. I'm actually getting my energy back after my little fainting nonsense. I think it's all the junk food I've been eating. The doctor told me I needed to significantly up my sodium and red meat intake. And I was like, "What? I am being ordered by the doctor to eat at Wendy's every day for lunch? Dang it!" Then I started eating a lot of chocolate and ice cream, because if red meat and sodium are good for me, chocolate and ice cream have got to be like spinach to my system, right?

John was part of the National Guard and full of common sense. Feeling sheepish, I pulled the machine through the storefront and into Starbucks. I had to walk through the line of people waiting for drinks to get to the closet, so each of the customers witnessed me take the vacuum across the store, walk into the closet, and shut the door behind me.

Well, after 4 coats of blue paint (2 different shades) I lived with it for a couple of days and decided to just prime it and paint it white. That way I can use it in different rooms if I decide to, and I am not stuck with a specific color scheme in the dining room.

Have you ever met a speaker, Psychologist, and Leadership Coach by the name of Louise Griffith? I had the pleasure of hearing her speak as a keynote at the womEn’s conference this month. Some of her messages about communication really stuck with me because of their clear, simple, and truthful nature. Because I’m still thinking about these messages nearly a month later I’ve decided to pass them on to my readers.

Gold anklets are nice as well as other materials such as white gold, platinum, beads, and others however for the simple brilliance and shine of silver there is no comparison. Sterling silver is 92.5 percent pure and the only reason it cannot be 100 percent pure is because silver is very soft so therefore it must be mixed with other metals to give it enough rigidity to be made into jewelry or other things.

The first issue was the belt, when pinned on it was over two inches short on both sides. After discussing it with my wife for a while looking to see what was wrong she noticed that the instructions said “When not specified, seam allowances are 1.5cm.” It turned out I sewed with 1.0cm seam allowances on all of the panels making up the skirt. That’s why the belt was so short. After unpinning it, resewing all of the panels and re-attaching it the belt now fit. At this point I figured I was almost done the skirt. I was wrong.

Gigli, Gigli, Gigli; words can not truly express how much I did not want to see this. Just reading the synopses last one night and I knew I was in for a two hour run of torment. To this day I remember seeing the commercials and trailers for the film when I was just a kid and wondering what was so great about it. Watching it now years later, I'm glad I had some sort of intelligence when I was a kid to stop my friends and myself from sneaking into it and seeing Freaky Friday instead (which also sucked, but way less than Gigli so I consider that a victory). Still, I guess we need to accept that not all bad movies will be so bad that they are good like our favorite Ed Wood classics. In any case, I dove into this one pretty much blindly and with minimal research on my part (a rare occurrence I would later both favor and regret).
The Philippine summer starts March until about the end of May. This is the time when you hide from the sun between 10am to 2pm. And the humidity oh my goodness! It is also when the skies are just amazingly clear and blue, yada yada… My point is, it is about time to dig out those itty bitty bikinis, pack the sunscreens (preferably with whitening agent if you’re Filipino) and hit the beaches!!! And boy have we got a lot of beautiful beaches in here. Yes I am gloating.

Confrontational Anti-Colonial, Anti-Capitalist
The crowd, which but a short time previously besieged the thoroughfares, is now replaced by straggling throngs of shopkeepers' assistants, porters, and others, whose avocations begin and terminate at a later hour than those of the main portion of the industrial community; and by eleven o'clock even these disappear from the scene, leaving the pavement clear to the idle, dissolute riff raff of the streets, who chaff the drunken sot that staggers along, with a curse on his lip, and the fires of gin caused insanity in his heart. God help his poor wife! for it is little help that she receives from him who, at the altar, swore to cherish and protect her, but who now dashes into the cold, tireless garret, and dog like, brute-like, devil like dashes her to the ground in his insane fury, and wakes in the dull leaden light of the early morning to find his wretched soul stained with the crime of murder! Perhaps the victim's dying scream was heard faintly by the tawdrily-attired, painted, and reck less courtezans who linger near the doors of still open gin places, or dance, in wild, frantic whirls, through the streets, or shout forth discordant snatches of song, which ring through the chilly night air like the despairing shrieks of fallen angels. One by one, however, all these vanish; and as twelve resounds from the church clock, the High Street appears deserted excepting a stray policeman here and there. The gas lamps cast a red flickering glare on the wet sloppy pavement, and perchance reveal some living bundle of rags, which lies coiled up on the stone steps of a sheltering doorway.
Despite promising no poetry, seeing as we’re in “The Orient”, I’ll leave you with a Haiku I stumbled across:
This is a fun one. Yes, I arrived by bike. Yes, pedalling. Yes, with that thing attached behind me. The shock factor prompts facial expressions from sickening disbelief (“No, no impossible!”) to all-out laughter at the ridiculousness of my undertaking. If it’s hard for my close friends to imagine why I would dedicate a serious chunk of my life to pedalling mountains, how can I expect a 70 year-old-woman who has never walked ten miles past her front door to understand? It’s inexplicable, preposterous, insane, dangerous, crazy, stupid—the adjectives that come from their frail, wrinkled mouths never cease to amaze me. Building up to the fact that I’m biking all South America, not just Peru, is always good for pity points, an extra heap of potatoes here, a larger lamb cut there.

Well, what are we to make of this? Virtual communities cannot replace real, face-to-face communities. They can’t perform the function of providing meaning and fellowship in the same way. And they certainly can’t serve as intermediate structures between the individual and an all-powerful government. Virtual community is really no substitute for the real thing.
I don’t know if it’s too late to make things simple again. I don’t know if they ever have been, or if I’ve just been incredibly naïve. But I’m losing patience with the sport I enjoy, and the vast majority of that seems to come from how disconnected I am with other fans. No one is blameless.
There are so many wonderful children's books out there, with beautiful pictures and stories, however the one in particular I want to mention today has very few pictures, in fact only a limited amount of black and white drawings in the corners of some pages, yet the stories of these books, for there are 4 all together, are absolutely enchanting. I am talking about the books of Tiptoes Lightly.

British Nurse struck off for threatening to nail patient’s hand to the floor if she buzzed for help: “A nurse has been struck off after being found guilty of a string of charges, including some despicable threats, after a misconduct hearing at the Nursery and midwifery council. Sally Miller threatened to a nail a patient’s hand to the floor if she buzzed for assistance and also told a colleague she felt like ‘putting a pillow over the head’ of another patient. She told another to drink tap water when she asked for orange juice, after which the nurse added: ‘If you f*****g touch this buzzer again, I am going to f*****g nail your hand to the floor.’”

“The U.S. lowered interest rates in 2004 to their lowest level in 46 years. And what did Americans do with their access to easy money? They borrowed and borrowed some more, investing the borrowed money into real estate. Looking ahead, perhaps the Fed’s actions (of 2004) will one day be regarded as one of the most costly errors committed by it or any other banking system in the last 75 years.”
Lynette, from Torquay, Devon, said they had now reported the care home to the Care Quality Commission after it still refused to put the sides up on her bed - despite the fall.

'But, as she cannot move herself, if she falls face down, we’re concerned she could suffocate.
(Note: My GF version thickened very quickly and needed more broth than the original recipe (original called for 1 1/2 cups). You may need a little bit more than this. I made this in advance and stuck it in the fridge in the soup pan that I made it in, then took it out and warmed and re-whisked it before mixing in the beef mixture and tater tots).
But I can so clearly see the subtle criticism now, that would always just leave me feeling badly and I didn’t know why. He blames us for so many wrongs and has never allowed any of us to freely express thoughts or emotions. Amazing how my new view allows me to see it without feeling it, and before I could feel it but not see it.
Wertham closes mentioning his recent symposium and his impressive credentials are listed at the end. The illustrations accompanying the article are equally telling. Three are reproduced on the second page with captions blaming them for the fall of western civilization, although while I must say that the "injury-to-eye" panel is pretty intense, it's likely the most extreme graphic example Wertham could find and not what little Johnny was regularly exposed to by any means. That panel was taken from the incredible Jack Cole story "Murder, Morphine and Me! from True Crime Comics #2 (May/47) and has become the standard bearer for all that was wrong with comic books ... graphic violence, brutality against women and a narcotics storyline. The fact that the panel below was a dream sequence and didn't actually happen, coupled with the plot being a morality play against the dangers of crime and drugs with the bad guys getting it in the end, didn't matter. Today the story is considered a masterpiece of composition and a pre-code icon of mid-century cultural significance.

Today, moviegoers, is the opening of the new Roman epic movie, The Eagle. In case you were wondering, in Latin, the title of the movie would simply be Aquila, that being the Latin word for "eagle". That might seem familiar to you if you're an amateur astronomer, as Aquila is the name of the constellation of the eagle. It might also be familiar to you if you have a particularly beaky, hooked schnozz, and we tend to describe such noses as "aquiline". To bring this crap-fest full-circle, the Romans were reputed for their aquiline features.
Today, the little illustration of 'Mammy' on the postcard would be considered non-politically correct, but back in the 40's, it was most certainly associated with Southern hospitality and cuisine.

These words did not take me by surprise…what did surprise me was his choice of “White man.” My family has always been a mixed bag when it came to ethnicity. Our background includes East Indian, Negro, Spanish and…yes even Caucasian. The neighborhood we lived in was mostly Negro and some of my best friends were Negro. Dad first marriage was to a Negro woman and they had 8 children. Racism was not in our blood, because we belonged to many races. So hearing the words “White man’s land” was very surprising.

I’d start small by helping children buy guide dogs and pay for education. My next leap would be to start funneling money to a research facility like HHMI so that we could make big changes. The whole prospect is so exciting to me that I could burst with it. There are miracles to be worked here, and I have my sights set on one in particular.

Yes, UTSA is in the Big Country despite having started its program just last year. I think the new league is going to want to tap into the Texas TV market, and grabbing large schools in big cities like UTSA and UNT might not be a bad idea. I’m not saying that either school dominates the news, or even creates that big a stir, in their respective communities, but when presenting a potential TV package to a cable/TV network, it could be a plus to have schools in big markets.

These pretences were not only dishonest but very cruel for they offered to underprivileged black students the promise and the appearance that they would receive an education of unaltered quality, prestige and utility, whereas in fact the opposite was the case. Coincidentally, these changes also collectively meant that the universities would fail the country.

I stopped on a whim today, between the post office and the UPS store, because there was a food truck that I didn’t remember seeing before, parked at the bottom of the big park / soccer field / walking track / gathering place in town (at the other end of which is the town stage where the little girl’s ballet performances used to be, back in Ancient Times). In the summer there’s an ice cream truck that parks up closer to the other end, by the little pavilion, but today there was a food truck down at this end. And the sign looked interesting, and I’d told myself I would treat myself to something novel and lunch-like while I was out doing errands.

Yet we often celebrate those that can stand up and preach, those that can stand up and lead sung worship on Sunday and those that do cold contact evangelism. I am drawing a distinction between those that lead sung worship and those that play in pubs/clubs etc because I think the audience is different and perhaps the purpose as well. Although they are both artists. But what I am really thinking about is what about our artists in the world? Those that draw, take photographs, cook great food, write poetry, write novels, sketch, make models etc for the world to see…yet they often get the back seat. But the church needs them, because these people are speaking into the culture we are in and they are engaging with it in a different way. The are reaching people who the preacher alone could never reach.

In Susan Brownmiller's book on Femininity, she suggested that critical thought about the dress form arose around the time that women were able to freely chose between wearing pants and dresses in the 1970s.

Long time rival, CEO Jack Masterson, finds a way to topple Burnside as his signature project in Ecuador turns into an environmental disaster. Now Burnside is demoted and head of the

I have always been one to change hairstyles, as well as the colour occasionally. I go through periods, I finally grow it out to the length I like and get the colour I like. Then I get bored with it, go into the hair salon and say take it off. I ask them what style they think will suit the shape of my face. Very rarely have I absolutely hated the cut.

CONCLUSION: A powerful ending to a dark saga, the characters of the City are not ones which the reader will easily forget. City of the Snakes is a good book to end out a trilogy and it remains to be seen what readers down the line will make of it when they read all the three books together. I for one, enjoyed this gritty, weird urban fantasy story about power, corruption and the redemption of one’s soul. A must read for all readers of the previous books and for those who like their stories dark & with a slice of Noir.

In November when I signed up for the December Blog Hop I remember having a faint sense of foreboding doing this for my first time and so close to the holidays, but I charged on. This weekend I was reminded about the blog hop and had to put aside my Christmas Cards, yes yes the cards are unfinished and yet to be mailed. Since we took the children in to raise MY free time grows less and I have to be much more focused than I am used to. So dear blog reader here is the card I came up with. It's actually a BIG old CASEd card from one of the Splitcoast Stampers challenges. I hope you find something useful from the card, paper choice or layout.
I now live in a larger town that has a library with several branches. I used to have the intention of visiting every branch, but that hasn't happened. I would guess that I have frequented 5-6 branches, though. I love the branch in my neighborhood because they know me and my children by name.
A high school student, William Swinimer, is now suspended from his school in Nova Scotia for wearing a t-shirt with the words ‘Life is wasted without Jesus’, the CBC reports. Some people apparently find that offensive. The CBC quotes the school board’s superintendent as saying that ”[w]hen one is able or others are able to interpret it as, ‘If you don’t share my belief then your life is wasted,’ that can be interpreted by some as being inappropriate.” The authorities are now apparently trying to find a “compromise” of some sort. In the meantime, the politicians have jumped, with the education Minister supporting the school board, and the opposition critical.
But this is a damn good beer. And who am I to criticize someone else's work and creativity, anyway. Especially when they're doing it right where it counts.

(4) The same King and God will pass judgment on the dead . . . However not all men will be judged by God at that time. Rather, only those who have practiced the religion of God. Sentence cannot be passed to acquit those who have not known God. They are already judged and condemned. For the Holy Scriptures testify that the wicked will not rise to condemnations. (Psalms 1:5). Therefore, only those who have know God will be judged. And their deeds that is , their evil works, will be compared and weighed against their good ones, so that if those which are good and just are more and weighty, they may be given to a life of blessedness; but if the evil exceed, they may be condemned to punishment.

It is at this time that Wilson acquires as case officer the legendary Tom Clines, and comes into association with fellow legend Ted Shackley. Shackley would be at Berlin during the building of the underground surveillance tunnel; station chief of Miamai during the Bay of Pigs invasion; station chief of Laos where he organized the Meos tribe into an anti-communist militia; station chief of Saigon during the closing years of the Viet Nam war. Both Shackley and Clines were very good spies. They got power. They got prestige. Shackley thought Wilson was a clear intellectual inferior. Yet, he was good at the most important thing of all, making dollars, while they were stuck at government pay scales. Clines would always hit up Wilson for loans. Clines would sometimes offer to drive Wilson in his beat-up Volkswagen. Wilson gave him the cash for a new car. I can’t afford to be seen in that, said Wilson.
The team are in tatters, but they decide to go rogue, work together, and head to Stark Tower where Loki’s plan is finally coming to a head. They have to fight his coming army and find a way to stop the portal, and take Loki down, and solve whatever problems they have for the greater good. This whole sequence is done with action that is both impressive and full of unexpected depth. When you see these heroes work together, when they really start to show off what they are capable of as one entity, it is a beautiful thing to watch. I don’t think I need to tell anyone that the day is saved, that the Avengers are a real possibility now, and while everyone goes their separate ways, they come out of it for the better. Stark’s learned how to be a better team player, Cap got back his leadership skills and found his place, Black Widow gets Hawkeye back and they show even without powers they’re formidable, Thor shows his growth as a leader and a king, and his compassion for both the humans and Loki, and they live happily ever after. Lol not really, but it was just a great ending. PS – for American audiences there are two scenes after the credits.

In the bowl of a mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites on high speed with salt and cream of tartar until frothy. Gradually – just a little at a time – add the 1 cup granulated sugar and vanilla, beating at high speed until the whites hold stiff, glossy peaks.

It is always wonderful to walk into a wine tasting room and witness the passion that the staff and owners have for their wine.

Middelvlei is the home of the Momberg family who have been wine farming since 1919.

I am very interested in trying to ignite the passion for self-directed learning in my K-8 students yet, until now, I have not tried this approach with our faculty. The problem with the push model is that it is not as customizable. It violates the the laws of supply and demand that make free markets work so well. Economist Adam Smith described the invisible hand as the mechanism through which needs were filled in a free market society. To paraphrase Smith, when a demand arises in the marketplace, a supply quickly follows as if guided by an invisible hand.

My only coherent recollections of the period between Tucumcari and Fort Irwin were broken shards of consciousness experienced from a contorted sleep in the front passenger seat.

God heard, and the Universe decided to lend me a hand. The very next day msn.com ran an article showing high school photos of celebrities, and guess who was among them. Oh Joy! I owe Mom Knowles a huge debt of gratitude. Beyoncé’s pic showed a smiling young girl in a white sweater and small cross necklace. Lady Gaga had a plain t-shirt, little if no makeup at all and her natural hair color. I was able to show the girls that these women grew up wearing the same boring jeans I now subjected them to. I talked to them about what it means to have a Stylist and “hair and make up people”. I think they are closer to understanding that Gaga attended New York University’s School of the Arts first. She was not made famous by a record producer walking down the street, seeing a girl with green hair, and exclaiming “What an outfit, who cares if she can sing!” (Though I’m sure that happens as well, judging by most of the pop genre).
The most I could get from her was that she loved "Everything about it!" I haven't read these books yet, so I'm having trouble deducing what it is she probably wants. Looking at her reading choices, it seems like she prefers paranormal books with PG romance. I also get the impression that these books are fun and upbeat, so maybe something with a similar tone?

SakeOne does not use sakamai, sake rice, but instead uses a type of table rice, Calrose, which comes from the Sacramento Valley, in California. This rice was developed in 1948, and "Cal" refers to "California" while "rose" indicates it is a "medium-grain." It is a hard grain, and some has been grown specifically for sake production, with a larger shinpaku, the inner core where the starch is located. In Japan, much of their ordinary sake, the futsu-shu is actually made from table rice, though most, but not all, premium sake is made from sakamai.

Eventually, the fugitive squad got the prints from Atlanta and realized they had the wrong guy, she said. "Unfortunately, you have to keep going down there. Otherwise, they'll drop the ball," Moore said.

Some of these cases take a lot longer than a week to sort out.

But wait, Jack, why should we be staunchly opposed to these people being allowed to enter into a binding, government recognized, contractual union that would grant them the same rights and protections of survivorship, communal property, and tax and insurance advantages shared by monogamous individuals in the same contractual union? Why or how does it really affect your life?
So now is the part where I have to talk about something that really set the gaming community, along with almost every gaming news outlet, on fire: the notion of character DLC. It was revealed there was twelve more characters on the game’s roster that were on the disc but are unavailable with the plans that they would be sold as DLC at a later date. These characters include from the Street Fighter side, Guy, Cody, Elena, Dudley, Sakura and Blanka, while the Tekken side included, Lars, Alisa, Christie, Lei, Bryan and Jack. Needless to say this caused a big uproar, and rightfully so, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t both disappointed and angry when I heard this. That being said while this is a pretty sleazy business tactic, it doesn’t drastically change my opinion of the over all quality of the game. That’s all I really want to say on that matter, I don’t want to turn this review into a rant about sleazy business tactics in games, so if this DLC notion bothers you a lot you should probably think twice before checking the game out.

On April 10th Bobby Petrino, still red-faced from road rash and embarrassment, was fired as head football coach at the University of Arkansas. Ten days earlier Petrino had wrecked both his motorcycle and his career while on a drive with his mistress and co-worker, Jessica Dorrell. Petrino, a married father of four, had failed to disclose his affair with Dorrell when she applied for, and later accepted, a job working on his staff.
So many people sang praises for and of this book and its writer. And as you can see it won the Booker Prize, so obviously it's a big deal. But books and reading is such a personal thing and I'm sad to say I did not enjoy this book at all. And I say, sad to say, because I don't pick up a book wanting to not enjoy it. And I finish reading anything that I start, even if I don't like it. I didn't like the story. I didn't like the style. People who have read this and Rushdie's work did you notice the similarity? I thought Roy was trying (a little) to write like Rushdie, and I'm not sure if that's the smartest move! This is a story of a family seemingly doomed by fate, set in Kerala, India in the late 1960s. The plot questions love, forbidden love, and the reality and nature of love. I still think it's worth reading. I still have my copy of the book with my little notes all over it, but haven't read it again.
So, I had to think of a creative, inexpensive, and durable way to display Lori and Lynn's work. It wasn't practical to frame photos, because the glass could get easily broken or the frames would get dinged up. Gallery wraps seemed fragile, too, since they could get dented or punctured if they got knocked over or dropped (hello, we have loads of little kids at our church, so things getting knocked over or dropped is not unusual).

The painting was originally thought to be by Van Gogh, but it was dismissed from his catalogue in 2003 after doubts about its origins. It was thought to be too large, with the signature in the wrong corner. The painting was created during a period during which the artist lived with his brother in Paris, beginning in 1886. Letters from Van Gogh to his brother mention the painting of the wrestlers, which helped historians put the clues together.

My last 1.05-mile split was much faster only because I sped up a lot in the last 0.15 miles. Otherwise, my pace was fairly consistent all the way through at around 4.1 mph. I just sped up at the end because I knew I was near the finish line. :) Sadly, I don't have specific mile splits from when I was on the loop. There's a mid-point that's exactly .35 miles, so every 1.5 loops equalled 1.05 miles. I took my splits at that.

This all sounds like pretty woeful stuff. But there’s a flip side to this self-imposed torture. It’s this very self-doubt that makes you strive to make your work the best it can be (and in doing so, become the best writer you can be). It’s the thing that makes you edit your work to within an inch of its life; worry about the weak points in the plot, and go back and shore them up; to ensure that the characters are as rounded and believable as you can make them.
Now that have that out of the way, I should also underline that I fear nothing. Except brain eating amoebas. And most birds. And tap water. And confined spaces, open spaces, bees, Brussels sprouts, Hittites, Styrofoam, latex, icebergs, robots, bobcats, umbrellas, people named "Clyde," triangles, the number 4, most small children, New Jersey, stairs, everything after 'Bromine' on the Periodic Table, crowds, saccharin, airline travel, hyenas, zebras, and numerous judges from a list of municipalities too long to list.
This morning I woke up Cancer free, just as I had all the mornings before, only this morning... I knew that waking up that way was a gift, and I thanked God for that.
Before I met your sister, I knew nothing about adoption or adoption issues. I’ve learned quite a bit from her and from her friends. I’m proud to know them, and proud to call them friends. I have to say I’ve learned a lot from you as well. I’ve learned the true meaning of obsessive-compulsiveness. That’s the only possible explanation, with the possible exceptions of paranoia and megalomania, that could explain the quantity and frequency of your lying, vicious, vapid postings. You’re boring. Repetitive. And I have visited your blogs.

Everywhere we go, Jacob is a hit! Everyone wants a piece of him!!! He's so charming and lovely. Don't get me wrong, he's a toddler! He hits a little bit, pinches, scratches... gets into things he shouldn't, but all in all he's a charmer... The following is a picture of him at our cousin's wedding in a little outfit Grandma and Grandpa bought him at the silk factory in Beijing. So cute!!!
On top of this my wife is dating again and has seen a guy a few times now. They text a lot and she smiles and laughs like I remember she used to with me. It’s really hard to see the woman you love moving on and dating someone else.
The CG menu is actually quite dizzying to look at because the pictures are passively transitioning from one picture to another, as I havent played much GIGA games you can also make a sequence preview of the CG sequence you want via center mouse button and looking at one of the chosen CG sequences, other than that its still point and click type viewer.
A key element to this project that I like is the Twitter element. The artist broadcasts to followers when and where objects are being placed so dedicated collectors can take the call to action and be a part of the project. (I plan to jump in the next time it is possible for me to do so.)
I’m in Banff, Alberta for another two days, a week in all, and it will be heart-wrenching to leave behind such spectacular beauty. I wake up every morning, in my little 8th. floor aerie, and peer out at the snow-capped peaks, painted pink with the dawn’s light or flirting through mist and snow squalls.
I’ve spent the last few months in a lot of social studies classrooms and I keep seeing the same thing. Kids who are wasting a lot of time searching for stuff. They can’t search effectively, ending up with results that aren’t useful.

I returned recently to the doctor after diagnosed pleurisy seemed to be refusing to go away. Conversation went like something this:
In our office we promote nutrition as part of our wellness program. If the body doesn’t get what it needs in the way of nutrients, then the cells it produces are of lesser quality. This means that the body that is being regenerated is actually deteriorating quite quickly in some cases. Cells reproduce exact copies of themselves, therefore when a cell is of lesser quality-it reproduces lesser quality cells. This process continues and is responsible for aging.
I wish her good health and many a glorious years ahead.
He has been wiggling it like mad lately, and it finally fell out just before school today. He was a a little concerned about the whole blood thing, but was reassured pretty quickly. M helped him wrap it up in a tissue and stash it in a sandwich baggy until bedtime. He is still pondering whether or not to let the tooth fairy take it or keep it for himself. The latter requires a written letter around here. We'll see what he decides.
and we were like..."who is Carson Brown?"

City documents show the city spent $71,994 from the red light camera program for an air-conditioned “tactical observation platform” used for surveillance in a WalMart parking lot. Another $55,000 went for a fingerprint station; $52,275 went for a crime scene imager; $28,234 on a K-9 unit; $20,000 for video and audio enhancement software; $8400 for body armor; $7800 for sniper rifle scopes; $5342 for cell phone forensic software; $5000 for training-room computers; $3750 for tactical entry rifles; and $3250 for a GPS tracker. Schirmbeck points out that the city knew the purchases were shady because a list of items funded by the red light camera program published on the city’s website omits all of the questionable items.

People frequently ask me, what are the best colors to start with when collecting Copics. I always answer that it depends what you are going to be coloring. If you color people, then go for skin tones and build from there. If you enjoy nature, then start with greens and browns. However, you may have only a few colors from each family and feel that your artwork has no depth until you get more colors.
What I think Kirk partially overlooks, however, is that conservatism is not limited to those "who find the permanent things more pleasing". Such people will of course be conservative but most people who adopt a cautious attitude to social change do so for a more practical reason -- because they see that as serving their basic aim of a better life for the individual. Almost all of the most influential conservatives (e.g. Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan) were in their earlier years Left-leaning, so their conservatism can hardly be attributed to an inborn preference for permanence or a dislike of change as such. They became conservative for a good reason -- to promote and conserve one thing in particular -- respect for the individual and for individual liberties. So, particularly in the progress-minded USA, Kirk speaks only for a small subset of conservatives.
The former governor of Alabama echoed a similar refrain in 1963. George Wallace stood in the doorway of the University of Alabama blocking the path of progress, both literally and figuratively, for Black Americans and for Southerners. I imagine that Wallace hoped to prevent Black students from integrating the University of Alabama, and White social psyches by proxy. Because it’s difficult to perpetuate the “lazy,” “stupid” narrative about Blacks when they sit right beside you in Chemistry class — when they have the same opportunity as you to succeed just as much as you. As soon as just one of “them” graduates with honors and just one of “y’all” doesn’t, then the superiority and entitlement you’ve grown so comfortable toting around, has holes in it. So does your superiority narrative.

Before I begin, please know and allow me to start by saying that I know exactly how wonderfully blessed I am. I have everything I could ever ask for… a family who I love dearly and never fails to support my every move. My amazing husband of 19 years treats me just like the queen of everything and has been known to move mountains just to please me. He is my rock and I have no idea where I would be today without him. My children, of course, truly are more than I could ever ask for; they are my heart and soul, they are my everything. They deserve a medal, too for putting up with psycho mom. My parents live right up the street from us and we have such a close-knit relationship. They are so supportive and loving to us all, we are very lucky to be so close, it’s wonderful to be so involved with the family, I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world! My brother really isn’t so far away… we can go for long periods of time without being in touch yet always seem to pick up right where we left off. He “gets” me (what an awesome feeling) and accepts me for the sister I am. How lucky am I? My life is extremely blessed and has all that I could ever need or want. There are really no words to express how I feel about my family. Words are never enough to make anyone understand how much each and every one of them means to me. Thank you all so much for being the reason… You know how that goes… I am a mother, a wife, a daughter and a sister. I am also a friend. Though, over the last few weeks I seem to have fallen short in all categories.
Jenna's mother-in-law is something else, though! Talk about a cold, controlling woman!! Holding on to hope and keeping a compassionate heart in such a repressive environment was a miracle in itself. But I wanted Jenna to do more with her 'anonymity'...kept waiting for the whole thing (don't to give it all away) to soar.
Next I grabbed my new Mayberry stamp set and stamped a few plums in versamark and dipped them in my mixture. Careful when heat embossing here because the kool-aid can make it a bit tricky to heat evenly and you may find it starts to bubble and even burn!

Director Edward Bernds lenses this about as well as he did many Bowery Boys and Three Stooges efforts - albeit with more metallic surfaces and alien chicks. Suffice it to say we have a few major scenes here that deal with elements that would have seemed more at home with Leo Gorcey glowering at his stupid chums or Curly Howard getting clobbered with a pipe wrench.
“Now therefore say to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem, ‘This is what the LORD says: Look! I am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you. So turn from your evil ways, each one of you, and reform your ways and your actions.’ But they will reply, ‘It’s no use. We will continue with our own plans; each of us will follow the stubbornness of his evil heart.’” (Jer 18:11-12)
So, there is a book called The Summoning (Kelley Armstrong). It is a book about a fifteen year old girl named Chloe Saunders. One day she starts to see dead people.

The girls soon leave and even though they could not get the egg back, they thanked Sakai, Junko, and Miura for their kindness. While the three are testing for radioactivity in an industrial area, Godzilla suddenly pops out of a beach (supposedly where he has been resting since his deafeat at the hands of King Kong) and begins to attack the surrounding cities. Godzilla appears to still be 'hung over' from his bought with Kong and stumbles about the area, falling down on several occasions. Godzilla also manages to get his tail stuck in the base of a radio tower and pulls it over on himself while trying to get free. At this point it is easy to see why 'Clumzilla' would become easy prey for both Mothra and her offsping later in the movie.

Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy.

Now I have not tried this one yet, but I am going to. So come back next Friday to see what I think. Share recipes here or send them to me and I will happily post them.
I have to admit, I am.
So we stood up from the recliner and I told him we were going to march, and showed him, when your left knee comes up you have to touch it with your right hand. Then your right knee comes up and you have to touch it with your left hand. I did it too, and especially standing there staring at him I kept getting my hands messed up- and he laughed. It was quick, but it was genuine- he was happy in that little instant.
None stand before her.

They never caught the two perps. Perps. Short for perpetrators. You pickup the lingo when you hang around those who speak it and I had practically lived at the area police station for weeks afterwards. Questioning. Demanding. Pleading. Crying. Resigned. No. Not resigned, never resigned. I would find out who killed Cassie and make sure justice was carried out.
At home I made the edamame. It's SUPER easy and SO healthy!
To the copyright thieves everywhere: do you really think we're this stupid? Do you really think that we're not going to find out if you try to sell our free tutorials in your Etsy shop?
Consider this: a vessel cannot be steered without control, and there can be no control over humans without convincing the mind. Enter the conniving con-trolls, the muscle behind the con narrative, the ones who keep the meme from straying of its concealed goal of conquest. Should someone dare to question it, or metaphorically “cross the bridge” away from its sphere of influence, the troll is there waiting to consume it, as we have all been graphically warned since childhood.
A major bone of contention with the proposed diagnostic criteria arises from opposition to the idea that it will result in the medicalisation of rape as the disorder is most widely reported by rapists who are receiving treatment:

Our strongest theory is that Paul has had some kind of gear failure in the storm on Friday night/ early Sat morning. The wind has been consistently blowing SW since then. We think that in such a case he would have chosen to sail with the wind instead of against it which he would have needed to do in order to continue on to Gizzy.
The ones who should be frontline are the most derelict in their duty. The churches have sold out to another master and no longer warn of evil (sin). The most they hope for (and promise) is a ticket out of the mess they've allowed to prosper, in fact have been instrumental in promoting. They are universalist in the truest sense of the word as almost nothing is sacred or set in stone anymore - nearly everything is allowable (if not today, we'll revise it tomorrow). Preaching a fuzzy, warm Jesus who really has no absolutes and anything goes. What people ? What law ? What kingdom ?

1. You probably wouldn't recognise me in real life. I don't mean in terms of looks (ok that too, I mean come on - that header photo was 5.5 years and 2 babies ago!!) but personality wise. I'm a shiny, happy, cheerful, chirping, competitive, teasing, challenging person in real life. Not sure what I portray on here, it's definitely accurate, but it is one facet of me - the facet that I don't really allow people in real life to see.
In meetings I have found my arguments being less than crisp; my reports are not quite as accurate; my project documentation is not as well thought through and generally I feel like I’m lacking the edge that used to define my work.
By the way, if you are a guy planning to purchase a ring for your fiance. It may not be a good idea to take her here first. When she sees gems that are the size of thumb, it will be hard to top it. If you’re a woman who likes jewels, gems and gold; you should go here first with him.
If you are anything like me you have been trying to awaken your fellow human beings to the dangers we face from this tribal mentality that has cast a dark shadow over the world for fourteen hundred years.

French Essence and My French Life by author Vicki Archer
As I tried to suggest in my introductory overview to this week-long retrospective, I think I was able, in 2009, to lay the groundwork for positive outcomes ahead. Professionally speaking, I'm getting more involved in film-related writing outside of my day job at The Wall Street Journal, and it's even gotten to the point where I'm occasionally asked to take on assignments, if I can. That sounds like some kind of progress to me, suggesting that I'm making some of the right connections at the workplace, that I'm impressing someone at the office with the work I'm doing. As far as connections go, I've made some inroads in at least knocking on the door of the cinephile community both in New York and online. And, of course, I'm trying to ramp up my blogging output here at My Life, at 24 Frames Per Second, and see if maybe I can build up a sizable audience with this here online journal. (Now, I just have to get better at self-promotion. If you all like what you read here, tell your friends!)

Some of these problems I’m still dealing with but they are not as rampant as before. Some of them I’ve dealt with nearly all my life, some just in the past couple of years. As I’ve made this list and put my thoughts about them down on paper, I’ve come to a realization that I created some of these problems though I didn’t know it at the time. I am convinced now that most, if not all, of these problems will no longer be issues for me by the time I’m done getting myself better and completely healed. It is so important to learn proper nutrition from someone that understands real, whole foods.
This was her father’s standard answer for the most part. Each day the hated food changed. Yesterday it was cotton candy. Tomorrow it might be water.

Your Sacred Heart contains a precious Seed Atom of Divine Love from the Goddess so that the Sacred Love of our Divine Mother is always present within, while deep within the Soul is your Diamond Core God Cell containing the White Fire Essence of the Creator so that Divine Will and all the qualities, virtues and attributes of our God Father are available to you. True joy and adoration spring forth from the Sacred Heart and the Soul, where UNITY prevails. From a human perspective it may be difficult to imagine that your Sacred Heart, your Diamond Core God Cell and your Soul are all an intrinsic part of your true Essence. When you focus on the Sacred Heart, it will seem to take a predominant position; when you focus on your Diamond Core God Cell, its power and majesty will come to the fore; and when you seek to connect with your Soul, it will become the blazing Light of Creator Love within your Solar Power Center. So please, dear hearts, do not try to compartmentalize the components of your Essence, for they make up one UNIFIED WHOLE.
Hello everyone! (I'm not actually sure who, if anyone, is reading this ha!) It's been a while since I've posted much of anything other than book reviews, and I apologize! Lots has been going on, and it just became too overwhelming to add another "to-do" into our already busy life.
She blinked, and a lone remnant of a tear wound its way down the curve of her face and dropped off her chin. Brushing its path dry with the back of her hand, she tossed the cell phone into her bag and inhaled sharply before cranking open the door and stepping out.

The late Dame Beryl’s third novel, like much of her early output is semi-autobiographical; apparently she actually worked in a bottle factory after her her divorce in the late 1950s, so I imagine that when she came to write The Bottle Factory Outing in 1974, she knew what she was talking about.
So I’ve made a new rule here when it comes to bootycalls. Strangers only. No friends. No exes. No old flames. No crushes. Keep things simple. Well don’t I sounds completely emotionally unavailable?! Makes me wonder why I even bother talking to men and giving them a chance? I guess I just know that my beliefs are a bit skewed right now. Okay so, I met a guy at work. We’ll call him Firefighter. I seriously had to sit there and talk to him and his friend forever to get like two dances out of him. Yeah, great…40 bucks, whatever. Firefighter wasn’t my type at all. Big, kinda dumb, total jock…. the furthest thing I wanted when it came to a companion. After finding out he was a firefighter my flame was lit. My very first “boyfriend” in highschool was a fire fighter. I was also 17 and he was 27. We even fucked in his fire fighting gear and everything. Always in hotels. I was naive and believed it was because he had a roommate and I was still living at home so that wasn’t an option. But later on I found out he had a girl friend. Go figure.
She was very specific: There had to be gold, jewels, and long, "mean" wings. I bought stick-on jewels at the fabric shop and she applied them.
