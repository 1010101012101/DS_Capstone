At dawn, we'd been a little irritable, perhaps having overappreciated local wines the night before. Plus, one in our party had been jolted awake by something snarling outside her window (we never figured out what). Driving north on Hwy. 19 at about 7 a.m., we craved coffee, so we turned west at a shabby sign that promised a small town, Cumberland, a few miles down the road.

He said he got his first truck at 17 and headed straight for the fields. Since then, he's been riding in the woods. The bog in Great Meadows was the first time he was part of an organized event.
My own experiences confirm Gibson's view, although I've often found even more trouble. Service at my home airport (Medford. Ore.,) is almost entirely on regional airlines, so just about anywhere I want to fly requires at least one connection. Getting seats on a single flight is tough enough; getting seats on a decent connection is almost impossible. Right now, for example, Delta's online booking system shows no one-week trips on any dates through June from Medford to Paris at the lowest award level, in either economy or business class.

"There should be absolutely nothing going on right now," he said. "But people are trying this stuff." One reason Gondolfi's so busy, of course, is that his agency is something of a lender of last resort, the place where entrepreneurs turn when they can't get a bank loan.

Most of Bangkok remained dry and most of its more than 9 million residents were staying put to protect their homes. Still, uncertainty over the capital's fate and the start of a government-declared five-day holiday fueled an exodus of people fearing the worst who clogged highways and air terminals to get out of town.

There are occasional nice touches. Kyra Sedgwick is funny as an obnoxious television reporter named Suzie Morales, who trills the R in her last name in exaggerated fashion. Titus Welliver is always a welcome presence, even if here he mostly stomps around and yells at people.

After telling a grand jury she had hovered in a hallway, she later said she had returned to a nearby room and then to Strauss-Kahn's, they said.

Sometimes, wearing clothing that fights your body is unavoidable: If you must wear a uniform, if you dress for dirty or dangerous tasks you may end up in garments that work against your figure. But it's also possible to simply default to clothing that fights your body, to wear it because you don't know what else to do, to follow the crowd. And you may not even realize you're doing it. Here are some sure-fire signs that you're pitting your clothing against your body:

Romney’s campaign has tried to spin this debate toward economic concerns by pointing out how women in the job market have been hit disproportionately hard in the last three years (without pointing out men had already lost far more jobs in the waning days of the Bush administration). South Carolina’s female governor, Republican Nikki Haley, attempted to press this point in a TV interview, insisting that what women really care about is the state of the economy. Unfortunately, she prefaced her comments by saying women do not care about contraception. It’s probably not what she meant to say, but a gaffe is a gaffe and this did not help the GOP cause.

Recent scientific research shows that parents have a huge role in what kinds of diets their children adopt in the future. Children who are fed high-fat, salty and sugary foods early in life crave those foods later and may become picky eaters, studies show. But children who learn to like vegetables and more exotic foods very early in life likely always will be adventurous eaters. Another maker of natural baby foods, Plum Organics, refers to the concept as "palate development."

He is particular about my wardrobe -- prefers me most of all to wear flannel pajamas or nightgowns with small flower patterns. If not that, at least I mustn't wear anything with a pattern that could be snakes or bugs. If I do, he screeches to a halt on the windowsill and refuses to enter the bedroom until I cover it with a robe. One pair of silk pajamas with an undulating pattern of white and black was particularly offensive.

I seem to remember a particular Register columnist getting a few licks in but, yes, Gustavo, you were right there at the start and then throughout. And, like you, I believe an inflated sense of self-worth is essential for a columnist.)

The Hilltoppers are a little bit of a sentimental pick, firing their coach mid-season and making the field with the Sun Belt's at-large bid despite a losing record. But the Delta Devils are 0-4 all-time in the NCAA and lost by 41 points back in 2008. Mississippi Valley State, 62-45.
Insurers that provide coverage for a nursing home stay, adult day care or a home health aide have seen higher-than expected claims at the same time their ability to grow a cash cushion has been hampered by low interest rates.

I have another idea. Why not wait until the economy recovers and tax revenues rise naturally to pay for the $512 million proposed increase above the "doomsday" budget? Or maybe we could call upon our media mavens to stop using incendiary language to describe a relative drop in the bucket!

Four homemade signs popped up where Glengary meets Shaker to share the street name and . . . well, some frustration. "536 DAYS – NO STREET SIGN," read one marker.

Though it sports bright colors on the exterior, the place isn't much to look at inside, with tired tables and bland decor, and ordering from pictures on the wall is a bit odd. But the food is worth the visit, especially because no dish will set you back more than $9, and most hover around $5 for a generous portion of food.
It was his second goal of the day, bookending the scoring for Philly.

Camby had 13 rebounds. ... The Blazers' lowest-scoring quarter came in the fourth quarter in a 2006 game at New Jersey: five points.
"I think that says it all," Martin says.
Ford is spending less on incentives. GM is continuing to de-emphasize its fleet business and that cost it market share, at least in April.
Are these Blazers too nice to win a series? Too polite? Too many good guys to win big? I keep thinking about that. And watching the Mavericks throttle them in the paint in Game 5 made me think about former Blazers power forward Maurice Lucas, and also, the Blazers teams of the late 1990s.
We're hoping to succeed; we're okay with failure. We just don't want to land in between. The app idea, which came first, was a way we were hoping to make TV without going through all the TV hoops. The magazine came later. Of course you want your peers and the public to engage with something like this, but I don't have any idea of who the people are or what they really think of it. I'm always prepared for people to be like, "This is just f—ing too ridiculous," and then it will all be over. That hasn't happened yet.
Many people join the tea party out of anger because they feel elected leaders aren’t listening to them. But leaders say raw anger is not constructive. Steve Maness, who is running a fledgling tea party group out of his Parlin home, recalled turning down a potential member who left a stream of vitriol in his voice mail.

Reliable voice and data communication are vital to the success of space missions. Imagine if Neil Armstrong's immortal "One small step for a man" declaration had been cut off in mid-sentence, or if Mariner 4 hadn't been able to beam back the first TV images from Mars. Radios relay commands, navigation signals and other important stuff. So NASA wants to rigorously test software defined radio – to "wring out the bugs and buy down the risk," as Malarik describes it – before putting it into regular use.

The Great Danes shadowed Jones with a short-stick defensive midfielder, essentially daring him to dodge – which is not his strength.

Utility officials late today said about 68,000 homes and businesses remained without power following Saturday's freak storm. Shelters and local organizations, meanwhile, continued to offer hot showers and a place to charge cell phones to those without electricity.
The unfortunate part of the whole story is that it takes away from what O'Leary accomplished on the field. He had nine catches for 152 yards and a touchdown. This kid — dare I say kid, since he's a full-fledged, adult-sized6-foot-4, 211-pound man among boys — is the most talented tight end I have ever seen at the prep level. Before that for me it was the former Michigan Wolverine, Pittsburgh Steeler TE Jerame Tuman out of little Liberal, Kan. Tuman could catch the ball as well as any tight end, but he was more of an extension of the offensive line.
His next-door neighbor, Stephanie Machow, 29, said he sometimes grumbled about his ex-wife, saying their divorce case began shortly after his leg injury. Machow waved to him Wednesday morning as she left for work, and assumed he was returning home after dropping off his son at school.

In New Jersey, pension experts have helped convince lawmakers that the system will run out of money unless changes are made that would affect current workers and those already retired. However, Sweeney, who has sometimes tangled with public worker unions, said he won't insist on additional sacrifices from public-sector employees unless the state is prepared to meet its obligation to the work force.
Initially, Billingsley-Walker's mother and sister ran out of the event, overcome with emotion as the words, "Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine. Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart and it feels like a cold night," echoed from the speakers.
It's pretty clear that only the chatmeister is really inside clubhouse dynamics, despite LaRussa screaming. Could you shad some light on why so many times the Cards defense is doing so trivial mistakes? I mean, it's pretty clear that the defense has holes and this was expected, but I see that many routine plays are missed and this seems more related to focus issues than to defensive capabilities. Am I right? Why is this happening? Please Joe, say that it's something fixable!

The novelty of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances overshadowed any disappointment over Michigan surprisingly slipping from a No. 3 seed to No. 4. It didn't matter to Zack Novak, the senior captain who spent many a previous Selection Sunday nervously worrying if the Wolverines would make the tournament field. So why would a four seed make him fret?
Dear Anonymous 3: Not if the context supported it. But this is so fraught. What if the ex had wronged your brother, and he decided not to tell you that because he didn't want to bad-mouth her? Then your "She's coming and you're sucking it up" approach would have been insensitive to him.

No one in Manley's position in the cultural world commands such attentive, powerful confidants and from such diverse and dynamic worlds. The internationally acclaimed Cloepfil is more than an adviser. He's now a partner of sorts, tapped to design the renovation of the 511 building, likely to cost millions.

care. Under IRS rules, however, hospitals can't count such bad debts - hospital charges a patient simply doesn't pay - as charity care.
They sniffed at Justin Blackmon and went all in on Richardson. After missing out on Baylor's Kendall Wright, they refused to lose Weeden (I am imagining owner Randy Lerner locked in a death stare with Mike Holmgren until the Browns got a quarterback upgrade), then drafted a right tackle to protect him in the second round.
Holder told a Justice Department news conference on Wednesday that "we believe that consumers paid millions of dollars more for some of the most popular titles" as a result of the alleged conspiracy. Pozen said the scheme added and average of $2 to $3 to the prices of individual books.

The city should step up enforcement of secondary employment or scrap the rules altogether.
Maybe it's a case of emotions getting the better of filmmaker Lawrence Kasdan. "Darling Companion" is close to his heart, inspired by Mac, the dog he and wife Meg rescued from a Los Angeles shelter who was lost during a trip to the Rockies. For three weeks they stayed and searched — and if the film is any indication, they fought and reconnected while trying to find Mac.

On Sept. 26 a campaign worker and colleague of mine stuck a campaign sticker on my chest without my permission. I reacted by taking the sticker off of my chest and sticking it on her chest.

SMASHIN' FASHION: St. Louis Fashion Week wound up on Saturday night with a "Liquid Style" fashion show at the Old Post Office Plaza that put downtown's best foot forward -- in more ways than one.
So modern economics has been oversold, and the public is now disbelieving. The disillusion feeds stubbornly low confidence. Because psychology is so important, the good news is that if the economy surprises on the upside, the boost to confidence could accelerate the recovery. The bad news is that if the recovery continues to disappoint, the discrediting of mainstream economic thinking will grow. The resulting intellectual void will summon forth new ideas. Some may be good, but others -- though superficially appealing -- will be fringe or lunatic.
State officials stressed it was highly unlikely that survivors would be found.
That, city leaders say, is the main goal anyway.
"The quarterback and the passing game, it is all about timing, but again, we felt we have a lot of trust in Sam. There are some hurdles to overcome, injuries being one of them," Spagnuolo said. "There's a lot of guys around the league, on our team included, that are playing hurt. It's tough at the quarterback position because their position is hard enough when you're fully healthy.

The full story behind the murder never was told, although the first to be arrested, John Harvey Adamson, laid out a plot that involved Kemper Marley, a real-estate and liquor magnate. Phoenix police never found any proof linking Marley to the case. Max Dunlap, a Phoenix contractor, was the only one to receive a criminal conviction that stuck.
Historically, Oregon companies draw venture backing at half the rate of the nation as a whole. But in the last 18 months, VC firms have taken more interest in the state's companies, a sign, perhaps, that Oregon's entrepreneurial community is renewing itself after years of stagnation.
"Three all-star guys and three guys who are effective," Yandle said of the Hawks' new-look top line.
In May, activists from Greenpeace scaled the Fisk smokestack and unfurled a "Quit Coal" banner — a dramatic, attention-grabbing tactic after years of protests, prayer vigils and street theater in front of the plants.

Note: McMillan said center Joel Przybilla probably would not join the team in Philadelphia for its game Tuesday against the 76ers. Przybilla tried to go through a workout Sunday in Tualatin, but cut it short because of lingering effects from the stomach flu. With back-to-back games Tuesday and Wednesday (at Boston), the best-case scenario has Przybilla playing in Friday's game at Washington.

A little more than a year ago, the makers of "Zookeeper" took the Kevin James comedy to the AMC Ontario Mills 30 multiplex for a test screening. The talking-animals film had been scheduled to be released in October 2010, but the Sony Pictures brass were so electrified by the audience feedback — the marks from kids were so good that one executive thought that the data must be wrong and needed to be recalculated — that the studio decided to move "Zookeeper" into the heart of this summer's box-office battle.
Ivan V. Lanier, a lobbyist for the Evitts group, said Friday he is pleased with the ruling. He said that his group has shown it has "the experience and the expertise" to build and operate a casino in Western Maryland.
When it comes to position players who could be identified as "core" eligible, there really is only one remaining in this year's market: Prince Fielder. Mozeliak told me recently that the club didn't plan on making any more "record offers" this winter. The club record, of course, is Holliday's seven-year, $120-million deal agreed to in 2010. Fielder also doesn't fit the Cardinals' MO when it comes to building or adding to the "core" of the team. As it was when Walt Jocketty was general manager, Mozeliak and DeWitt act to lock-in potential core players before they reach free agency or trade for them in time that they get bathed in Cardinal culture and all that. The examples are numerous: Holliday, Carpenter, Lohse ... et cetera.

Stevens, who will lose her job July 1 under the police chief's budget cuts, said the data historically has been compiled and released without informing management decisions.
13. Likely permissible. Typically, loans are considered extra benefits. But if the relationship between the student-athlete and longtime friend meets the criteria of a "pre-existing relationship," it may not violate NCAA rules. The stipulations center on timing; specifically, when did you become friends? If you grew up together and were neighbors your whole life, it would be a lot less suspicious than if the "longtime friend" entered the player's life after he or she reached acclaim.
At the rate Cobalts have been selling, dealers might not have enough to last until August -- leaving a gap of a month or more when Chevrolet could have no small car to offer shoppers.
Squatters moved in. Jacobs said she had to appeal to the city and the Broward Sheriff's Office for aid in getting the putrid pool covered — so no child would fall in — and the windows and doors bolted shut to discourage the squatters.

"Control" dies before he can prove his case and "The Circus," Le Carré's fictional MI6, passes into the hands of Smiley's rivals and peers, Percy Alleline, Roy Bland, Toby Esterhase and the dashing Bill Haydon, who promptly kick Smiley out.

Hilton also said County Councilman Dion Guthrie's earlier proposal of shipping the trash out on trains was not economically feasible because it would cost $2 million for every 5,000 feet of rail siding, and the amount of rail siding needed would be "tremendous."
Even by getting that concession from Obama, Voinovich demonstrated the value of his maverick status within the Republican Party.
Price most recently served as the superintendent for seven years in Middletown City Schools, a district of about 7,000 students in Ohio, before resigning last July.

But after the first snowfall, he admitted: "It's getting tough."
Once deep in the doghouse, Brandon Yip's working his way out. The right winger scored twice and Kevin Shattenkirk broke a third-period tie on a power play, helping the Colorado Avalanche snap a two-game skid with a 4-3 win over the St. Louis Blues on Monday night. Struggling with his game, Yip has had to watch from the sideline in three of the last four contests. Hardly the way to work out of a funk.
At the end of the evening, Douglas reminisced about his days at the O'Neill, his friendship there with Danny DeVito (and Devito's first words to him: "Hey, you get high?"), and his affection for O'Neill founder George White and his wife Betsy ("who are the heart and soul of the center").

For those of us concerned about the welfare of pigs raised in the conventional manner, small farms raising heritage breeds allows us to support farmers who treat their pigs kindly. We can buy knowing that the pigs we consume were given a healthy, happy life. One should note that not all marketed "heritage pigs" are raised on small, healthy farms. Buying directly from local farms is your best bet.
Many of Letman’s sculptures are abstracts with loops and openings, as if something natural has passed through them. Or as if they are inviting something to pass through them. Their eyes and hearts seem wide open. Their skins can be as rough as bark or as smooth as a deer’s belly. It’s as if all of nature’s forces have followed him indoors.
Not only did Cox rule that former Chrysler dealers who won their arbitrations do not have a right to reopen under the same market conditions as before, he also ruled that the dealers are not owed monetary damages.

"It's a terrible thing that happened," Smith told me, when I asked how she would answer questions from people who question why a killer should be released. "She did commit that act, and she paid gravely for it. It was instantaneous, an act that she committed in the heat of passion. It wasn't really a conscious act. Under the law, that's voluntary manslaughter, with a maximum of 12 years. She served 27-and-one-half years."

It is possible that if Google does what John suggests, that they will be off the hook legally. I am not a lawyer. But it still certainly seems socially wasteful to force the copyright owners to do the searching, and if Google want to be held to a higher standard ("do no harm") it should undertake this task on its own. Even law is supposed to take the public welfare into account, from time to time.
Theories about why the merger talks collapsed include conflict between executives of the two airlines, and a weak earnings report from United that made Continental reluctant to dilute its standing as "best in class among legacy carriers," Swelbar said.

Everglades National Park Superintendent Dan Kimball said his staff jokes that the python is the "spokes-snake" for all the exotic species infesting the park.
Mary Zimmerman, the Chicago playwright and director, embraces big, brave stories with gusto. No doubt that at least partly accounts for her popularity; she doesn't confine herself to "realistic" accounts of lives taken up with daily struggles. It doesn't hurt that she's a beautiful writer with a shrewd eye for the physical pleasures of theater: imaginative costumes, exotic settings, gymnastics.
John McGinnis, a conservative law professor at Northwestern University, said Pearce's interpretation is "just completely wrong." The "plain meaning" of the amendment is clear, he said.

Dear TV Watcher: Actually, what you're describing isn't all that uncommon, especially with small dogs. If Lulu is only growling and snapping when she is on your lap or next to you, you could have a case of "lap guarding" on your hands. Lulu most likely views your lap as an item to guard, much the same way a dog might guard a rawhide or a toy.
Sadly, one egregious misstep was unforgivable. A long-ago visit acquainted me with Annondono's skill at producing a truly heavenly risotto, one of the best anywhere.

Every high-flying note, and every snappy word (the performers' diction is ideal) is in place and full of punch. But despite the superficial quaintness of it all - the lush bustles and floral-bedecked hats of the ladies, the piratical derring-do of the Pirate King and his fellows, and the hilariously self-important antics of the Major-General and the Sergeant of Police - it is fresh, funny and surprisingly up-to-date. And Chicago wordsmith Kingsley Day has even put several winning flourishes on the lyrics, including a deft mention of The Hypocrites' recent post-modern version of this same operetta.
Audra McDonald’s performance in “The Gershwins’ Porgy and Bess” made me want to convert to whatever religion she’s founding. Andrew Garfield in “Death of a Salesman” plunged me into such profound emotional depths that only James Corden’s hilarious turn in “One Man, Two Guvnors” could restore my mirth. Steven Hoggett re-imagined the possibilities of dramatic choreography in “Once.” And Tracie Bennett as Garland redefined the meaning of “wowing ’em.”

Lande, who is only one voice, has LSU wide receiver Rueben Randle as a first-round talent. Lande had Randle third on his WR board, behind Blackmon and Floyd. Randle is 6-3, has top-end speed and can play outside. He's certainly a possibility. But other WRs could catch the Rams' eye. There are good WRs remaining, so I wouldn't obsess over Randle.

Some important technological innovations, such as a stronger metal alloy, weren't adopted for commercial use until the 1980s, Mr. Ino said.

Single-composer orchestral programs can lack sufficient variety to completely hold audience interest throughout an evening. Part of the pleasure of concert-going is discovery, hearing how works in different veins contrast and illuminate one another when juxtaposed sensitively.
