"Again we don't know yet. If tom said that Colt would e the quarterback in week one then I think we have to let that thing play out and let them compete. Pat Shurmur has an awful lot to say about that. Both Tom and I are kind of watching from a distance a little bit. I think it'll be obvious and then we'll make the decision. The bottom line is that everybody wants the team to do well. Everyone wants the team to do better. I expect us to take a pretty good jump this next season and so we have to play our best guys. We'll see who they are down the road."

The bottom line: The CDC recommends alcohol-based hand sanitizers for a reason, says Dr. Don Goldmann, a professor of immunology, infectious diseases and epidemiology at Harvard University. Benzalkonium chloride doesn't work as well. Goldmann says the ingredient has fallen out of favor with doctors, partly because products were often contaminated with bacteria. (Not a good sign for a supposed germ killer.) "I would never have dreamt that anyone would resurrect it for a hand sanitizer," he said.

The Question: My wife and I are refinancing our $285,000 mortgage, which we got five years ago at 6.25 percent. We're debating whether to do a 15-year or 20-year loan or just keep the term we have, which would be 25 years more, or go back to 30. There's a slight drop in the interest rate if we reduce the term. Is there some rule of thumb?
I have known many teens with the family money to hire coaches and tutors, attend camps, buy expensive equipment, and do whatever else money could buy. Some of them were lacrosse players, but some were also soccer players, sailors, thespians, and musicians. The pressure, year-round schedules, and high expectations put on students are far from a lacrosse problem. This is an issue that has been discussed for a few decades now.

The orchestra was in magnificent voice, with the many solo parts well-played. Putting the three offstage trumpets in the Dress Circle was an effective touch, making the sound more immediate dramatically as well as acoustically.

In another age, in another kind of venue, there would have been lighters flicked and Frisbees flown Friday night when Lang Lang came to town. As it was, the boisterous ovation in Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall when he appeared on stage confirmed, before he played a note, that the 26-year-old pianist is a superstar. An even more enthusiastic reception followed his performance of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2 with Carlos Kalmar and the Oregon Symphony, and while some purists undoubtedly sniffed at his approach, the shouts and applause were enough to drown them out.

Mr. Rosenberg said KKR has a competitive advantage in real estate because of the firm's large staff and the numerous companies it owns through its buyout portfolio. He said he can call on executives at these companies to help his team size up possible acquisitions.For example, before buying the suburban Chicago retail property, named the Yorktown Center, Mr. Rosenberg said his team spoke with executives at more than 100 companies, including Toys 'R' Us, which KKR acquired in 2005 as part of a consortium. Because the toy retailer is a tenant at the Yorktown mall, it was able to provide KKR with insight into the area's household income and consumer-purchasing habits, he said.

Of course, since Howard opted into the final year of his contract, the Nets subsequently traded for Gerald Wallace, and that cost them their first round pick this season -- protected through the first three selections. They had owned the rights to Houston's first rounder this year, but that was lottery-protected. Since Houston will not make the playoffs this season, the Nets now don't have that pick this season. Now, unless they end up with one of the top three picks in the draft lottery, the Nets will not have a first round pick to offer in a trade this summer. Currently, the Nets are tied for the sixth-worst record in the league, with Toronto. They play the Raptors in their season finale on Thursday.

Last year at one point every player on the Bears' offensive line was playing a different position than they played most of their college and pro career. Gabe Carimi playing right tackle when he was a top left tackle in college. Chris Spencer played right guard; he played center most of his college and pro career.

Look at the demand for locally grown foods, grass-fed beef, organic foods, all the rest.

We became very, very dear to each other in the sense that it started with my teaching him sitar. And then gradually I saw his interest in Indian religion and more than religion, actually, philosophy and the old culture. And I helped him get many books to read, and that's how it started.

Del Rio Vineyards "Rogue Valley" Pinot Noir 2008: One of the complaints -- justified -- of southern Oregon winegrowers is that vintage information about Oregon wines is skewed to the Willamette Valley. As anyone who's traveled the length of Oregon knows, the climate (and terrain) of southern Oregon is considerably different from that of the 100-mile stretch of the cool, moist Willamette Valley.

If your tastes run well past merely macabre into sick and twisted territory, you'll be delighted by "Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)" (10:45 p.m. Friday-Saturday, Cinema 21). The vileness of director Tom Six's premise (a disturbed scientist kidnaps victims and surgically alters them to create something resembling a centipede; take a wild guess how they're attached) was not matched by the on-screen action the first time around; in this reboot he achieves a disgusting sort of artistry by filming in stomach-churning black and white, making the villain even crazier and doubling down on the shock factor. Truly reprehensible and, in its way, perfect.

It would be one thing if the gas tax had gone up with inflation, but it hasn't. It's still stuck at 1992 levels — back when 23.5 cents per gallon represented slightly more than one-fifth the cost of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline. The result has been that Maryland's investment in transportation infrastructure has not kept pace either, despite increases in various transportation-related fees.

But Whedon has managed a feat akin to last summer's "Thor," finding the fun in what should be, by any rights, an exhausted genre. "Avengers" isn't deep (yes, we really should all work together) and it doesn't reinvent the comic-book movie. But it is fun, and if it's an indicator of the season of cinema to follow, this summer is going to be epic.

From the committee's news release:
Hollande is a shoo-in because in the second round his center-left party will collect almost all the votes of parties to the left of the Socialists, and also most of the votes of the centrist candidates. Sarkozy leads a center-right party, but he has to pretend to be much harder right than he is for much the same reasons as Republican U.S. presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
Speaking of feeding those in need, this coming weekend is the annual Scouting for Food drive.

On Saturday, April 21, these young ladies and men will be going door-to-door to collect donations of non-perishable food and then delivering it to more than 30 food pantries in the county. Last year, this initiative collected more than 87,000 pounds of food and the goal is to do even more on behalf of our local hungry families.

Last time, I did that thing people do. Go to dealership. Point to nearest passable automobile. Grunt. Agree to pay 437 percent interest. As that money pit collected years and dents and bad brakes and miles, I knew it was time to be smart. I would save a down payment and buy a new, or at least newish car. This time I would not be a fool. I would do the work, secure my own loan. But I was worried. While many car salespeople are good, fair people, I nonetheless look like a Cabbage Patch doll. Would I be taken seriously? I employed that magnificent tool of deception called the Internet. If people can make themselves look 40 pounds lighter in sexy Facebook photos, surely I could manipulate a deal on a car.

Winter: Winter is the extreme quiet time, with few visitors and fabulous discounts at the lodges in the valley. On Super Bowl Sunday, I was standing in the meadow near Swinging Bridge, and the only noises I could hear were the wails of a distant coyote and the wind blowing through the trees. There was only one other human about. I could hear the crunching of his boots through the snow before I saw him. The scene was completely colorless, stark, leafless trees contrasting with the snow showed only shades of black and white.

Court rules give judges broad discretion when setting bail. On a murder charge, for example, bail guidelines can range from $250,000 to $750,000, though most judges tend to set it higher.

Virtually all bonus plazas are required to be open 24 hours a day, barring a safety issue. And police must be invited in by the owner, just as a homeowner would have to.
The true gap may even be wider, because the study did not account for the full impact of investment losses in late 2008, during the stock market downturn, and because many plans employ multiyear smoothing techniques to lessen the effect of a single year's losses. But more recent stock market returns could help -- on Wednesday, for example, Pennsylvania's $47 billion public school pension plan reported it had earned about 12 percent on investments in the 2009 calendar year.
Last October, Americans turned in 188.5 tons of prescription drugs at over 5,300 sites operated by the DEA and nearly 4,000 state and local law enforcement partners. In its three previous Take Back events, DEA and its partners took in almost 500 tons of pills.
"That hurt me to my heart, you know," he said about the day Roy retired. "The Foye-Roy stuff, that was probably one of my saddest days in basketball, for him and because I wanted to compete against him, play against him. Let this go down in history so we could look back on our careers and see. I don't know what my destiny is yet, but I wanted there to be something great between us, where we were battling in the playoffs every year, me and him.

One transfer who has had one season and a spring practice under his belt now is Dominique Rouse at Winter Park. Rouse will be one of the go-to guys for big Winter Park quarterback Sam Richardson this coming season.
We'll connect the dots. The moment she realized her marriage was not going to stand up to the pressures of fame -- or as Kate prefers to see it, when the tabloids found a storyline that suited them -- that's when she should have pulled the plug. When Morales suggests this, Kate blows it off, saying she would have been forced to put up with tabloid coverage of that, and then she would have been stuck a single mom without a decent source of income. How about living off your earnings? Or how about not having eight children that you could ill afford?

I urge President Obama to fulfill his constitutional duty and utilize his pardon power. On rare occasions, the power has been misused and abused; he does not have to repeat those (mostly political) mistakes. Historically, presidents have wielded the pardon power generously and appropriately, granting hundreds and even thousands of requests, with scandals few and far between. Most recipients are everyday, unknown people who desperately need a fresh start.
And there have been plenty of great ones, and great moments. Halle Berry's weepy speech in 2002. Paul Sorvino in the audience sobbing like a baby when his own baby, Mira, read hers in 1996. Jack Palance breaking for some one-armed pushups during his, in 1992.

The National Enquirer broke the story on its website Wednesday, drawing worldwide attention to the therapist’s allegations.

I reply, "In a heartbeat!"

Staton: "In our particular — right now we've got seven that are assigned as detectives for our agency in our detective unit, so we've got seven.

Put turkey in oven. To assure that the bird cooks evenly, rotate roasting pan 180° every 30 minutes while turkey is roasting. Roast for about 1 hour, remove foil and baste turkey with 1/2 cup stock. Return to oven and roast, basting with pan drippings every 20 minutes, using more stock as needed. Start checking internal temperature after about 1 hour of roasting time. If legs begin to get too brown, cover loosely with foil. Roast turkey until internal thigh temperature reaches 165°. Total roasting time should be about 2-2 3/4 hours.

Since 2002, the Clark native has written for, executive produced, directed and co-starred in two of the FX cable network’s most beloved and most violent adult dramas — “The Shield,” a Golden Globe-winning series that followed a group of corrupt Los Angeles cops for seven seasons, and current hit “Sons of Anarchy,” which he created, about an outlaw motorcycle gang in the fictitious Charming, Calif.
One of the major concerns for scientists is the need to have accurate photometer calibration standards. Calibration standards are needed for the quality assurance and accuracy of readings. If calibration standards are not precise then there is a high potential for inaccurate results and analysis. In effect, inexact laboratory results wastes valuable time and resources.

Alas, Collins does, in a Bollywood-style closing-credits burst that seems to be where Singh spent a lot of his energy. "Mirror Mirror," the first of this year's two live-action Snow Whites (Kristen Stewart and an evil Charlize Theron star in the darker "Snow White and the Huntsman" this summer), has amazing images, from the opening "Once upon a time" animation, to the castle that looks like no fairy-tale castle you've ever seen, and the snowy forest that doesn't quite seem real.
"Classifications were vague or non-existent," Councilman Dave Greenspan said Thursday.

Maybe it wasn't "The Decision." Maybe it wasn't LeBron James announcing he was taking his "talents to South Beach."
The worry for many is that the ECB will be too hasty in getting rid of its crisis measures, that the more hawkish members of the governing council are overly-worried about rising inflation at a time when growth could well grind to a halt as governments enact deep austerity programs to get their public finances in order at a time when the economic outlook in the U.S., and Japan for that matter, is cloudy.

Brooklyn’s Coal Burning Brick Oven (161 Hackensack Ave., Hackensack; 201-342-2727) may be the most awkward pizzeria name in New Jersey, and its history, recounted on the menu, somehow involves Mt. Vesuvius and a Roman emperor. But the pizza stands out. The half plain/half sausage boasted a raised puffy crust — Wiener called it "lusciously tender." Okay sausage. A second pie with peppers and red onions was saucy (thank you!) and satisfying.
The governor wants the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio to quickly restore rate discounts for every residential property that relies on electricity as its sole power source. And he wants the discounts put in place permanently, regardless of who owns the home or when it was purchased or leased.

Members of the union covering teachers, bus drivers and food services workers in the little district just voted 183-0 to accept a new three-year contract with raises of 2 percent a year. That's modest for districts in the North, where pay boosts are usually higher. Under a new state law, the union members also will be contributing 1.5 percent of their salaries to pay for their benefits, so their raises for the next three years will amount to a slim .5 percent per year.

Best Historical Album
Persistence paid off, but not for quite some time. Ten years after that initial trip to the states, a major label finally bankrolled the release of an Urban solo album. (A set recorded by the Ranch, a band in which he was a member, had come out two years earlier.) "Keith Urban" went platinum — his first of four million-selling albums — and spun off four hit singles. On "Golden Road," his next full-length effort, Urban began to introduce some pop and electronic elements into his arrangements. Some of the stance was borrowed from classic rock. But Urban’s heart belonged to country.

"We had 8,000 people on the roads for different events through the year, and what we discovered was that a lot of them were new to bicycling, they didn't know what the rules of the roads were, and we wanted to educate them," Guanari said.
