Our newer 7D has a host of benefits over it's older sibling, but amazing autofocus (helped me get this shot: Maia and the dolphin ) and high ISO performance are two ones that really are most apparent.

UPDATE: 27th April, 2012. The Irish Times reports a reaction from Treasury to this case. It is, according to the newspaper “surprised and puzzled” by NAMA’s application and “we remain open to discussing and agreeing the resolution of this issue without the need for a further expensive outing in the courts funded by the taxpayer” said Treasury (hopefully).

As evening drew in we ate a home cooked meal for the first time since Koh Tao. The surprise was due to arrive at around 9pm and so we kept the kids up, Mateo was seriously flagging so we got him ready for bed and the big boys too.

I can't call Richard Norton Smith a lazy researcher with a biased memory or a partisan hack until tomorrow night's episode airs and I can see how much attention he pays to Perot's concern with both deficits, but the September promos all left out the same thing, and I thought I heard a giant sucking sound.
To go meta on the issue here: as a child actress coming into fruition, Dakota's heading into some treacherous waters... she needs a Keith Richards life preserver. She's a lost little girl, and making your personal lostness part of the role isn't the same as playing a lost little girl in such a way as to make us swoon from your lostness, to cry and pine and bemoan our own lostness at the same time. It's not just Cherie throwing a tantrum of indecision, it's Dakota throwing a tantrum by draining Cherie's tantrum of cinematic resonance. It's kind of like when your trying to do improv with someone who wont obey the first rule of improv (always say yes) so every attempt to start something is shot down by them without even thinking ("I'm a devil!" - "No you're not")- In that way Fanning's become like another child star whose precocious genius seemed to fade between ADDAMS FAMILY and MONSTER: Christina Ricci (as Nathan R. writes about on Film Experience). If moviedom was their parents, Christina and Dakota would be going through a phase, a kind of passive aggressive tantrum, like Richard Burton in EXORCIST 2 (below). Sometimes too, as with Burton, if you have a rep of being a great actor, directors are skittish about telling you how bad your sucking. And you go on auto-pilot, not realizing future generations will be laughing at you for aeons to come.

Does this mean he doesn’t believe at all in the value of economic growth? No, the president’s new appointee is not trying to eliminate economic growth from the equation, as he also believes that “sustained increases in national income – that is, economic growth – are required for poverty reduction.” Relying on previous research, he argues that countries that made crucial developments in poverty reduction and human development have also “done quite well in securing long-term economic growth.”

Here, Kali refers to the personified kali-yuga. Pretention and fakery is his primary character trait. The cow-couple refers to the cow of Mother Earth and the bull of dharma. Dharma has four “legs” – pillars that hold up morality: truthfulness, simplicity, compassion, and cleanliness. In each age another leg is broken. The only leg that remains in Kali Yuga is truthfulness. The age itself pummels away at this leg so that it crumbles and is completely destroyed as the age progresses.

At various points in the town are memorials of the constant wars between Percys and Scots in which so many Percys spent the greater part of their lives. A cross near Broomhouse Hill across the river from the castle marks the spot where Malcolm III of Scotland was killed in 1093, during the first Battle of Alnwick. At the side of the broad shady road called Rotten Row, leading from the West Lodge to Bailiffgate, a tablet of stone marks the spot where William the Lion of Scotland was captured in 1174, during the second Battle of Alnwick by a party of about four hundred mounted knights, led by Ranulf de Glanvill; and there are many others of similar interest.

Now, in the late evening, it is raining buckets, but I don't have to be out there so I am glad. The dog very briefly went out back and was more than happy to come back inside. He got wet enough in the very short time that he was out there. The cat very wisely is staying inside where she belongs. It may be a matter of being smarter or having better bladder control, I don't know.
Although I enjoy reading the author comments in the PEN/O. Henry collection, I am not sure an author is always the best person to explain the intention or the meaning of his or her story. An author may indeed recall the origin of the story, but when he or she writes the story, other forces take over. The conventions of storytelling, for example, force the story into well-travelled paths, in which certain actions take on symbolic or universal significance whether the author intends this or not. When you ask an author the origin of the story or what really happened that instigated the story, the author may be able to tell you, but this may have little to do with the story itself. When you ask an author what a story means, he or she may be able to tell you that he or she had certain intentions, but these also may have little to do with the story.

It feels weird to be looking back from a half-century in the future at "modern" art - the non-representation sort of art that has garnered praise and brickbats through the decades. Jasper Johns, the emotional dipper of paints, the platonic ideal of the "modern artist" lies at one end of the spectrum. Rothko is at the other, carefully laying down layers and pulling the colors forward, until they vibrate on the canvas. Rothko is a careful worker, struggling on a set schedule, to create his art. Yet both styles of modern art remain outside the comfort zone of the average art viewer. So the question ends up, what is the purpose of this art?
For a Jewish audience, to call someone Lord seems to violate the foundational principles of the Hebrew Bible as found in the shema. If the Lord is One, and Jesus is Lord, then he must be the One God. While that has been the claim of John’s gospel all along, that is a shocking statement for the Jewish world to accept. We know from the book of Acts that there was a suppression of the apostolic claim that Jesus is Lord.

This is a brilliant collection. All three women are skilled writers with amazing ideas. I would be hard pressed to find a story in the collection that I didn’t like. There is murder, love, magic and monsters and sometimes all of these things. I often found myself stunned silent at the end of a story, just blown away by what they had managed to do in so few pages.

It's hard for me to select my favourite Muppet character. Was it the drumming machine, Animal? Or hapless Kermit the frog? Or saucy - but control-freak - Miss Piggy? Despite the fact that they were dubbed in Spanish and the voices didn't always match the characters' personalities (a fact I found out much later, to my chagrin, when I came across the original programmes during my uni days) I fell for the charm of this facetious pastiche of famous songs and artists.

Okay... enough about Halloween... I want to talk a little bit about what brought me to Education.com in the first place. Being a homeschooling family, I am always on the lookout for great resources, and Education.com is my go-to site for printable worksheets. It is fairly easy to find printable worksheets for preschoolers all over the web, but I have more than just preschoolers. Education.com is like a one-stop shop for me. I can browse through worksheets from a variety of subjects for levels from preschool all the way to high school. I can browse by grade level or by subject, or narrow it down to both. The website is VERY user friendly, and not only do I always find exactly what I am looking for, but I also end up printing out a couple of extra worksheets that just looked fun!

David Lynch has generally presented himself as a kind of naif, and “no cinephile”, working more from inspiration than influence. While this is largely true, and offers a useful explanation of how his films end up in the strange and wonderful places they do, I’ve noticed over the years a few moments that definitely betray the influence of specific other movies, some of which are equally revealing of Lynch’s approach…

William Marshall's effigy.

Nexavar, although is not a life saving drug, has shown to extend life of a patient for around 4-5 years in kidney cancer and around 6-8 months in liver cancer.

So training stepped up in April with my first event of the season being the Rockin K 50 miler. I came out of that relatively unscathed with a 50 mile PR time of 10:04. Not bad for the rolling hills of Kanopolis State Park. The following weekend was Brew to Brew. 7:39 later I rolled in to Lawrence feeling great. The next weekend---the Lawrence Marathon. I got suckered into going faster than I wanted to and ended up with a respectable 3:39 marathon but the fatigue started to show from the high mileage weekends. The last weekend of April was the Free State 100k. I will just say it ended up being the Free State 44 miles. Then came May---with a trip to Vermont to help Danny Miller complete 200 miles---I got in 70 over a 2 day period of time. 2 weeks later was the 50 miler at Clinton lake---I was asked by Gary Henry to run it so I could evaluate course marking. Well, I didn't have a problem with the course markings because I knew where I was going. Many others didn't and became lost. I wish I had too...it was a long day and I bonked early and often. By the time 8 hours rolled around I hadn't even put in even 40 miles yet. Slow day indeed but with the mud and the heat it was good training. I quit at 37 miles....not because I was done like Free State but instead because I had a BBQ to go to in KC that evening and if I continued I would have been late. Then along came training camp---70 miles of running on the course. I wish all my vacations could be like that. It was just a whole lot of fun discovering the trail I would be running in 3 short weeks.
My new phone(Paul and I upgraded to smart phones and handed down our old phones to the kids a couple weeks ago) hasn't been working right, and yesterday I kept missing calls because it wouldn't let me answer. It was also turning itself off mulitple times a day. So went to the TMobile store. They right away said it was defective and would replace it. Then tried to charge me shipping and restocking fees!Um....NO. I was within their 14 day policy and still had to fight to the point of pointing out that we purchased it on 31 of March and it was only 12 of April. He kept trying to say I was a month past the 14 days! I left with a new phone and not owing anything. I do have to go back when the manager is there, because I don't think I should have to purchase a new screen protector when the phone was defective, not damaged because of me.....Argh!

The Rooster is the sweetest, most even-tempered baby in the history of babies. But my family is just starting and your family is done, and I don’t know if I can do three more years of this without knowing that you are doing it too. I know you don’t know me, and it is so very selfish of me to think this way, but we were in this “holding down the fort while our husband gets his school on because we run a mean egalitarian household” thing together. And I know it makes no sense, but I feel abandoned.

However, he denies that it was the practice of the paper to pay police officers and “to his knowledge” the paper had never done so.

I visited the Oxford University Museum of Natural History a couple of days ago for the 9th Coleopterists' Day (more about that soon). While I was there, I had a wander round some of the exhibits and was distracted by a display of excellent trilobites. I have a couple of fossil trilobites at home, but nothing as spectacular as what was on show, so I felt compelled to take a few photos and find out a little more about them.

Surprised? Ho Chi Minh was a political genius, tricking everyone into believing his lies. Using patriotism, nationalism, and the pretext of fighting for freedom, Ho Chi Minh demonized the Americans and defeated them in the war. It is true, Ho Chi Minh was an inspiring man. He was a charismatic individual who was able to gain support from many people inside and outside of Vietnam. However, actions speak louder than words. The crimes he committed against humanity have clearly been proven. He was a criminal, not a patriot. Thanks to him, Vietnam is now going through a phase of decline and self-destruction. He is not the hero that we all thought he was. However, I will acknowledge his title as the master of deception. He’s a tricky one.
I debated whether to sell or keep the old bike. I thought about using it as a spare, a training bike (does a heavier bike really make you stronger?) or as a commuter bike. The frame is scratched and quirky enough that it wouldn’t attract thieves, and even if someone did cut the cable, I wouldn’t lose my “good” bike.
I had the nicest make-over with Penny at Cover FX in Harvey Nichols and loved the products she used. For one reason or another I haven't got any to try out at home until now and one of the things I have been trying is the Translucent setting powder which I still love. It's not cheap at £29 an not very manageable in terms of size and packaging but really sets foundation fantastically without being at all heavy and actually leaves the skin feeling incredibly smooth.

This news will probably be all over the OSR in the next day or two, but just thought I'd do a quick post on it. Paul Jaquays, one of my favorite JG designers from back in the day, has had gender reassignment this weekend. Apparently he has been unhappy for a long time, and this is bringing him happiness, according to his Facebook page.

Then Jackson is enlisted to help capture the lead suspect in a murder— a man who happens to be Sarah’s most ardent suitor. Jack must continue the deception, and weathering this newest and gravest betrayal will be Sarah’s ultimate test. But as Jack’s passion for her grows, he must also reveal his own secrets. And as the killer turns his attention to his pursuers, more than love and trust is put at risk.
Pay attention American women. So long as you continue to support the farce that is today's government in Washington DC; the same government that kisses Islam's big fat ass at every possible opportunity in the name of Political Correctness, that girl in the picture and video just might end up being you in the not so near future.

Official wedding recaps are upon us, and you have all been loyally following me here on this blog. However, in the past few months, Blogger has been giving me a ton of problems. One of these problems includes transferring my Weddingbee posts over. You see, I compose my Weddingbee posts in WordPress...and for some reason Blogger is giving me a heck of a headache when it comes to copying them over...the photos will not load for me. After failing about 20 times at copying my first recap over, I realized that I would have to upload each and every photo again through Blogger to post it here. For those of you who have already gone through the process of wedding recaps, you know how long it takes to compose one post...uploading photos alone takes a LONG time! I just can't do it for two different blogs...there isn't enough time in the day!
This is one reason vacations are hard for me when dieting, I think. There seems to be a lot of complimentary food, or food included in a price I’m already paying, and I “want to get my money’s worth.” The penny-pincher coming out in me again.
I just had to finally ink up these darling stamps and use a technique that Debby from the DT at the Penny Black blog uses on her cards. It is such an amazing look-she is the "Queen of Everything" when it comes to layering her images! I finally found some larger embossing tools so I could make my images 'rounded' if that makes any sense. It is hard to tell on these pictures.

Be sure and mark your calendar for the weekend right after Thanksgiving. I'll be out in San Marcos, TX with a bunch of other artists selling our creations at the Eye Of The Dog Art Center. This is the third year I've attended this show as a crafts person. It is definitely a good time. Much different from shopping at the mall, in a very good way. You'll need directions as it is out in the country. But, with art, food, drink and fun, absolutely worth it. Check it out here. Friday night is a sweet party there with Ponty Bone playing. All are welcome, hope you can make it out.

I used the same recipe for fresh grape sorbet that I had made before. After simmering the grapes on the stove with a little bit of water, I pressed them into a strainer to extract all of the juice. Then I added honey and a little bit of sugar. And then I just froze the mixture in my popsicle trays instead of churning it in the ice cream maker.

Yesterday I had high hopes of taking the kiddos to the zoo. When we arrived there wasn't any parking spots. Yes, you heard me right. It was insane. So in my frantic desire to do something fun with the kiddos without going mad I went to the Botanical Gardens a street away. They ran and explored. We had a blast. I visited the shop Leaf n Petal while there and fell head over heels for the decoupaged wallpaper. The colors were quite gorgeous to say the least. Such an inspiring day it ended up being. Today we are getting up a bit earlier and trying for the zoo once again. Fingers crossed.

Brooke: Mine may be a little unconventional. I usually read a PrayFit or FCA devotional each day (though I do like me some Oswald Chambers : – ). Or, if I’m participating in a Bible study at the time, I’ll dig into the reading for the week. I also LOVE the drive across the Atlamaha River delta. The drive from Darien to Hofwyl is a no radio, no cell phone zone. It’s pretty inspiring to see what God does in that stretch of wilderness each day.
“The guy I liked was away for the summer and you had just met yours and we made a pact to win their hearts. And we did,” I added somewhat triumphantly. “And since then my whole life plan has changed so many times, I’ve had a few other boyfriends and a ridiculously long relationship with a boy I lived with, and now I’ve no idea what I want to do with my life. You also broke up with your guy and you’ve been around the world and you’re moving to Australia next week.”
The two things I thought to try were baking soda or vinegar. Soak the covers in a tub with water and a generous helping of baking soda, then rinse rinse rinse or do the same with vinegar. I've heard about people using "oxyvin," or oxyclean and vinegar, to strip really icky diapers. The oxy clean and vinegar create a chemical reaction (use caution!!) to clean the diapers.
A ‘trial-within-a-trial’ was also held by Judge S.P.B. Hancke, assisted by two assessors, to determine the admissability of a conflicting signed and sworn confession by the one of the two accused black men who are on trial for murdering the women; their gardener, Joseph Hlongwane (22) and Joseph Khumalo (21). Judge Hancke examined all the statements submitted to the court by Hlongwane, including his claims that he had been ‘threatened, forced and dictated’ by the police to submit this confession.

Sheikh Yousuf Al-Qaradhawi: “I would have liked the Iraqi people to be interested, first and foremost, in the resistance against the occupation, in liberating its land from the American occupation, and in liberating its will from the new American colonialism, and only after liberating its land and its will – to place Saddam and others on trial. But when the American ruler gives the order to set up the tribunal, and when the Americans supervise the trial, and their generals are present at it – this is unacceptable to us.

Obama insisted that he signed the bill simply to keep funding for the troops. It was a continuation of the dishonest treatment of the issue by the White House since the law first came to light. As discussed earlier, the White House told citizens that the president would not sign the NDAA because of the provision. That spin ended after sponsor Senator Carl Levin (Democrat, Michigan) went to the floor and disclosed that it was the White House and insisted that there be no exception for citizens in the indefinite detention provision."

Climbing Soakham Downs, I stop to get my breath back and to admire the view behind, across the Stour valley, the river’s line marked by a palisade of tall poplars; beyond, the North Downs ridge marches towards Dover. Pressing on, the track gradually becomes enclosed on either side by typical chalk flora: old man’s beard, dogwood, field maple, and bright-red-berried (but deadly poisonous) black bryony. And of course beech trees of all ages: saplings, spreading mature specimens and powdery rotting stumps sporting huge Ganoderma brackets.

This move does not come as surprise to many with the way the season has began for the young outfielder. The only other legitimate option the Cardinals had was to move Tyler Greene to make room for Craig. Greene, who has played in 15 games posting a .200 average thus far in the 2012 season, is one of the five active infielders on the Cardinals 25 man roster. With the return of Skip Schumaker, the Cardinals would have had plenty of depth left in the infield.

And it got me to wondering, where does this talented “animator and film-maker” fall in the whole spectrum of integrity? Frankly I’ve been really cranky that I can no longer assume that if I see something I can believe it. I have found myself bitterly wondering, ‘does he care about integrity at all?’.
Before I cooked the fish I put together the veggie dish. It was a black-eyed peas/potato/coconut mix that sounded like it was going to be sweet and savory at the same time. So I chose to use yam as the potato (because it didn’t specify) and shredded coconut instead of getting a whole coconut and shredding it myself. Start with sauteing the spices, add the coconut, peas, and “parboiled” potatoes. (For anyone that doesn’t know what that means, it means to partially boil your potatoes so that when you cook them they won’t be charred on the outside and raw on the inside. The recommended time is about 5 to 6 minutes and then drain and rinse to stop the cooking.) Next was the lime juice, a little bit of stirring, and then I put the lid on and let it sit at a low temp.
Gasps from the children and adults assured me I had made a huge mistake. It went something like this…
A one-sided version of history entirely sympathetic to jews. This means that for any historic conflict with other groups or individuals, the non-jews are and always have been entirely to blame. In a nutshell: jews have always been the victims of horrible persecution and oppression at the hands of stupid, crazy, evil haters.

How do you feel about these two cases? Do you think Mike is just as culpable in Case A as he is in Case B? If you do then you are accepting (subject to defeaters) that attempt liability is a legitimate idea. But in doing so you open up the door to some problems. Chief among them being the problem of distinguishing an attempt from a non-attempt.
Through my DayQuil haze I was having the hardest time figuring out where I’d seen Karen (Jessy Schram) before. Then it hit me that I remember her playing the wife in Unstoppable. It’s very probable that I remember this only because her husband was played by Chris Pine aka the new Captain Kirk. Typical HNG brain, typical. She sure is a cutie though. Good choice for a “girl next door” turned “post apocalyptic freedom fighter chick.” Her fate is unclear and considering the huge crush Lourdes has on Karen’s man, Hal Mason, I’m guessing that Lourdes is going to be mending Hal’s broken heart with her sweet lady kisses in an upcoming episode.

"When heels were first introduced into Western dress from the Near East their original purpose was embraced. Heels kept the foot in the stirrup when horse back riding. However, when the rider dismounted, his high heels would sink into the mud. So in the early 17th century, men began to slip their high heeled shoes or boots into a pair of flat-soled mules to prevent their heels from sinking into the mud. The wearing of mule with shoes or boots did prevent the heel from sinking into the mud but when the wearer attempted to walk a loud slapping sound could be heard made by the sole of the mule slapping against the heel of the shoe or boots---similar to the noise that flip flops make I would guess. Women’s fashion followed men’s in the early 17th century so they too began to wear slap-soles but women’s slap-soles often feature the heel secured to the mule sole so that they did not make noise when they walked. This was okay for women’s footwear because women had no need to separate their high heeled shoes from their mules as they were not going to go horseback riding."

Then I found hymns. Despite the fact that I had grown up in church singing hymns, I’d never really listened to the words. It didn’t help that there was often a disconnect between the lyrics and the music, but I’d never stopped to really wonder about these words in the old stodgy book I was holding. While in college, my campus minister, who loved music, introduced me to some of the most amazing Christian music. One CD he played was called Indelible Grace – old hymns put to a new sound. I listened to that CD over and over (and now I have all of the CDs on my iPhone – go technology!). Since then, more and more hymns have ended up on my playlist.
Translators want to get the right word out! So they must ask the right question. For example, in order to translate “carry one another’s burdens”, the Koma translators in Ghana had to choose between mili (carry on the back), dogi (carry on the hip), vigi (carry on the shoulder) and chii (carry on the head)! So which word did they use? (Hint: What do Koma people carry where?). Please pray for translators who have to make difficult word choices to convey the right meaning.
As the LEGO vehicle moves, centrifugal force raises a lever that pushes a gray gear forward along its axis of rotation. As the gray gear reaches the yellow gear at 0:23, it engages another set of gears that pushes an arm; the arm, in turn, pushes another axis that changes which gear is currently engaged to the output gear, which finally performs the “shifting” action.

Another factor, however, which contributes to split personalities online is the native anonymity of the internet. The screen name may be one of the most regrettable developments in our era. How are you to know, even when someone uses a ‘real’ name, whether such a person is really that person? You cannot, unless you have met and confirmed with the person in real life. And anonymity such as this gives permission for a number of things: it permits us to pretend we are not ourselves—we can intentionally alter our online personas. Anonymity also permits us to say “what we’re really thinking”—a regrettable sentiment which is really shorthand for “the ugly thoughts I cannot share in polite company.” Don’t get me wrong, not all anonymity is bad—there are times when, for external reasons, it is better for people to share from the security of an alias—but those times are rare. Most often online, anonymity serves as the darkness under which we hide our indiscretions.

Add sweetbreads, thyme sprigs, bay leaf, cover and gently simmer, until cooked yet still quite tender, about 8-10 minutes. Toward the end, add the sautéed morels and the juices from them. Then, carefully remove sweetbreads and morels to a dish, loosely tented. Also remove and discard the thyme sprig bouquet and bay leaf. Add the apple cider vinegar, mustard and crème fraîche and, stirring, reduce the sauce further over a higher heat until it thickens and nicely coats the back of a spoon. If necessary, season with salt and pepper to your liking. Add the sweetbreads and morels back into the pan to heat and briefly bathe in the sauce before plating.

What about the world's resources and why they're owned by cunts and not by everyone? Why is there poverty, hunger, genocide?

*Memento was narrowly beaten for the "M" slot, and since I can't talk about it there, I'm taking advantage of the Nolan tie-in for an addendum to this post. Memento is a phenomenal movie, but may not be for everyone due to the way the story unfolds: Backwards. A movie about a man with short-term memory loss who's out for revenge, the movie opens with the last scene of the story and then goes back to the beginning, scene by scene. The effect is stunning, but giving the viewer a sense of confusion that helps identify with the main character because as his memory fades after a few minutes, he is also coming into each scene not knowing what happened right before it; however, as the movie progresses, we the audience know where everything ended up, and watching the motivations and characters shift as their backstories come to light builds suspense and provides a set-up for a great twist at the end...er, beginning...er, just check it it and see for yourself.
Tied to Kenneth Anger by Hollywood Babylon suicide, biker subculture, and black magic, PSYCHOMANIA would be good on a bill with both LUCIFER and SCORPIO RISING.

He's cut his hair. He's traded in the schedule of the road for a 6 AM to 10 PM proselytizing schedule (which might actually be easier...). He's traded in fame and adoring fans for door to door possible humiliation and being openly mocked by those who do not believe nor understand his faith (side note, I've had missionaries over to our home for dinner who have shared experiences such as having beverages hurled at them from passing cars while riding their bikes down the street.)

Duck Dynasty, Ax Men, Hillbilly Hand Fishin’, and Swamp Loggers all have dedicated time slots in my evenings now.

Rather than limit itself to the input of a few “experts,” Wikipedia, instead, relies upon the tremendous pool of knowledge generated by bringing together a group of diverse people. Few of us may be able to call ourselves “experts,” but each of us knows something and, if we’re honest, the vast majority of us know a whole lot about at least a few things. If we were to pool our various areas of knowledge together we would, in essence, create a new kind of expert – a communal expert. And this expert would have access to all of the information that’s in all of our heads.

I visited Willamette yesterday and watched the students pitch their venture ideas to Angel Investors. Nerve wracking for them but they did a great job inventing new products and researching the market. It seemed intensive but something I will have to do if I am accepted in to the MBA program.
Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art. Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art.
These are the basic questions to ask yourself. Once you've answered these then you an go on to the actual details. In the next blog post I'll go into more on choosing what to grow.
There is a pattern to the media cycle that is as predictable as the seasons. Before Anzac Day the press will be looking for stories of sacrifice by those who have served in the defence forces. During Melbourne Cup week, the jockey - largely ignored for most of the year - finds he is king of the airwaves. And during the quiet news periods of Christmas and Easter, church leaders have the opportunity to make headlines with their sermons and pronouncements.

Meanwhile, while I was reaching new heights, Corbet and company were struggling. Just days before their 2011 Pride weekend was due to kick off, it was announced that Corner Brook Pride Inc. had cancelled plans due to apparent lack of support from city officials. CBC filed a report that contains a variety of accusations. A city official fired back in the comment section.
This year there are some fantastic titles to choose from for all ages.

So I head out to the chicken house and grab a bunch of poop/straw, I pick up the poop that is EVERYWHERE (a whole nother blog post) and dump it into a large plastic container. I've tried to re invent the wheel and didn't bother with the burlap sack or pillow case that most websites recommend the manure is put into....I just threw the poo in, added a scoop of soil (micro organisms), and filled the pails and containers with water.....(Let the water off gas overnight before adding poop if you're on city water!)

In terms of characters, I think these ones could have been better. Leah's sister was overwhelmingly naive and annoying. Her inner thoughts didn't match her age at all -- she seemed more like an eight-year-old rather than a twelve-year-old.

If you’re in your car during an earthquake, stay there until the shaking stops—a car’s shocks will actually absorb a lot of the shaking and keep you fairly safe from falling items. Be sure to stop carefully if you’re en route, as you don’t want to cause an accident by swerving or stopping suddenly. Don’t stop on a bridge or overpass on a freeway if at all possible. If debris or other items fall on your car, carefully open the door when you exit, to be sure nothing will slide off

Actually, there's probably a lot of layers here--this is where I play around and try out different techniques, just to experiment to see what works and what doesn't, knowing that it will be all covered up, but noting any color combo or technique that I want to remember. And then one more layer..

When I heard this on the national news, I phoned Ms Lahaie, stunned. What are you doing, I asked. She said, you can't understand, our children have ruined our lives.

The kids are finally back in school! And LPC has just reminded me that I haven't blogged in a while. I've been doing a lot of shopping, and I've been up to my earlobes in fashion magazines, because on the way home from England, I loaded up on English magazines and read all the way across the Atlantic. But I have a lot of half-baked thoughts to work through before I can post anything coherent.
If you find yourself in the same situation, not knowing where to turn and everything seems to be closing in on you remember that Jesus is very near. Talk to Him as you would a friend and open your Bible and He will guide you into just what you need to hear. Our scripture for the day and the one that God showed me when I needed it most is found in Isaiah 41:10. it says “Fear not, for I am with you. Be not dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you. Yes, I will help you; I will uphold you with My righteous right hand.”

I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again – one single paint color throughout your home will create the necessary continuity to let decorative objects stand out and hold their place of interest. Take your queue from an art gallery or museum where spaces are connected by unified color. It focuses your attention on the subjects and creates harmony for all that is taking place.

As I began looking at material for a new discipleship emphasis that we were starting at church, I began to get nervous. Either there was not enough content to really challenge my folks or the expected workload would have required taking a three-month sabbatical to complete. Thankfully, I was introduced to Absolute Basics.

Which brings me to the entire reason for writing this article. I was listening to a certain album this evening, while driving along. I happen to like it a lot and much of the reason I like it is the singer’s voice. So, I was thinking of how to describe her voice. And then got to thinking about communication.
"The advantages of a lie are always short-lived," he writes in 'Through a glass, rosily', an analysis of Leftist efforts to portray accurate reporting of the horrors of Sovietism as counterproductive and worthy of suppression even when allowing that they are true. "And yet," he continues, "genuine progress can only happen through increasing enlightenment, which means the continuous destruction of myths."
If you feel the need to pull this apart, just remember that the ring for 2 sits below the ring for 1, looking at it as seen below. There is a little spring that hooks the two together. When together, they really only fit into the barrel one way, with the shutter levers fitting into notches, so you can't really put it back wrong. It may not work until you actually screw it back to the barrel, because the parts don't sit flush when out in the open like this, so don't worry if you can't make the shutter or aperture move. You probably won't ever need to pull these out, unless the camera doesn't work. Removing the barrel does make it easier to clean the front of the camera and the levers.

Not kidding. I cannot make this up. I guess she had turned around from coloring to see that the dining room had filled up and was indeed filled with old people. Of course, many of them had eyes on her because she is young and so adorable. It freaked Emy out to say the least. For the rest of the night she sat in my lap and refused to even walk through the dining room without being carried. She was terrified. I hope she does not carry this fear with her throughout her life like people do with a fear of clowns.

This really is a fun Valentine to give, and it worked out perfect that there are 24 cans of Play-Doh in a box and both of my boys have 24 kids in their class. The fun part of the big box of Play-Doh is that their are ton of different colors so the boys can go home with a can of blue or green and the girls can have all the pink ones:)

I left the East coast and moved to Oregon. Oregon was a new world for me with mountains and coast close by. I could find myself in the midst of either by traveling east or west for one hour.

Not bad at all, even though I say so myself. I'm really starting to see this novel take shape, more so than any attempts I've made before. Perhaps this is the one. I can only hope.

As of this morning, it appears that a vehicle ran over many of the remaining bollards. Debris is scattered all over the roadway and adjoining sidewalk. Bollards are either missing, snapped in half, or have been pushed off their moorings and are certain to fall under the wheels of passing vehicles sooner or later. Someone has taken the time to collect a few bollards and place them behind the guardrail that keep traffic away from the nearby rail overpass.
Imaginary little man is also going to need a new area rug. (We have wall to wall carpet in this room, but I love having an area rug in there now...it makes a great play spot and adds a bunch of personality to the space.)

I went shopping today. Finally getting around to going shopping with my birthday money. So while I’m all excited about my new clothes, all I can think about is showing them off for Chase. I hope he likes the stuff I got. I like it. But as I sit here in my new top and shrug, I think it would be a perfect going out outfit. I’m planning what jewelry and make-up I’ll wear and deciding for what event I’ll wear it when Chase is home. I’m currently leaning to a night out, maybe dinner with friends. What I’m really thinking though is how Chase will look at me throughout that night. That look that says “wow, she’s gorgeous.” I like that look. I miss that look.
Thankfully, not all games follow this pattern. Few exceptions include Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood and Mass Effect 3. Brotherhood introduces the most creative and unique mutliplayer of its time. It’s unfortunate that Ubisoft couldn’t continue to innovate with Assassin’s Creed: Revelations. Mass Effect 3 is also a noteworthy example. While wave-based co-operative gameplay is anything but new, Mass Effect 3 includes a multiplayer narrative that directly affects the single-player campaign. This satisfies the masses while placing a strong emphasis on the single-player experience. This form of innovation is what can truly change the industry in the coming generation.

If you’ve worn down a groove of panic reactions, it takes a while, but you can wear a new groove down through patient practice. Another way of saying this is that if you’ve taught yourself to believe the often very strange beliefs people with panic disorders have, you can also consciously teach yourself to believe some more pleasant things (that are factually true!). After really committing to CBT I have not suffered a strong panic attack for seven years (and even that one was a bit of a flash in the pan), and adrenalin is something I now actually enjoy. At times I’ve felt myself going into anxiety mode and I’ve gone back to do a refresher CBT course, which has turned things around again.
Growing up, my first real feud when I started watching WCW was Sting Vs Flair. They have had numerous matches against each other, they know each other as well as they know the back of their hands. Sadly, this match didn’t live up to their usual standards, but then again that was never the intention. No question, the reason why this match was moved to Impact, and not at the PPV was so they can edit it….just in case. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t tarnish my image of two legends, and Flair should stay with TNA as a mouthpiece for someone.

Any ideology or outlook that tries to explain what government should do at all times and in all circumstances is un-conservative. Any ideology that sees itself as the answer to any question is un-conservative.... Contrary to all the bloviating jackassery about how conservatives are more dogmatic than liberals we hear these days, the simple fact is that conservatives don't have a settled dogma.... we all understand and accept the permanence of contradiction and conflict in life. Christians and Jews understand it because that's how God set things up. Libertarians understand it because the market is, by definition, a mechanism for amicably reconciling competing preferences. Agnostic, rain-sodden British pessimists understand it because they've learned that's always the way to bet. Conservatism isn't inherently pessimistic, it is merely pessimistic about the possibility of changing the permanent things and downright melancholy about those who try."

As suggested by the Script Frenzy website, I also read a screenplay for a movie that I was less familiar with because, I guess, subconsciously I could be laughing and enjoying the Mean Girls screenplay purely because I am replaying it in my mind. So I read (fine, partially read) the 10 Things I Hate About You screenplay. Keeping with the theme of high school drama and cliques, 10 T.I.H.A.Y. differed greatly to Mean Girls. I laughed aloud at some parts but it was harder to imagine who Kat or Bianca were. I probably would have greater knowledge if I had read the full thing but I don’t exactly have all day. Also, within the first couple of pages we are introduced to a whole bunch of characters and confusing situations that require, what seems like, a lot of information to absorb. Of course, consideration needs to be taken because this is just a draft and it wouldn’t be as difficult to understand on the big screen.
And of course, as usual, I haven't been sleeping enough; averaging about 3 hours a night for the last two weeks. Combined with the 2.5 hours a day in the car.... yeah, I'm not exactly at the top of my game. I've barely even READ blogs this last week, never mind written anything that wasn't work related.
As an aside, is there some irony in the fact that the Google blog editor doesn't recognise the word "blog"?

We also get a look at Elsted, the guardian village located high in the mountains above the banished city.
The husband, Richard, and I have a daily hang-up caller. I have become adept at saying, “Have a nice day,” hopefully before he hangs up. Whether it’s in time for him to hear me, I don’t know; but it makes me feel better. I don’t have the slightest idea what pleasure he gets out of his calls which occur daily between ten o’clock and Noon. I have given up stewing about it because all it does is raise my blood pressure. In fact, I have come to the point of feeling uncomfortable until he calls. I sit at my computer and say to myself, “Well, if you’re going to call, come on and call. Let’s get it over with.”
You have to watch the whole thing.
“It doesn’t matter what the market is doing, I don’t say whether or not it’s a good time to buy,” association chief economist Cameron Muir said in an interview Monday. “That being said, I would suspect investors are actively looking in the marketplace for bargains.

Thereafter I allowed my pure and sinless body to be wounded from the foot to the head, and to be crucified for all the sins of mankind. That same body is now offered each day on the altar so that mankind might love me more and remember my great deeds more often. But now I am totally forgotten, neglected, despised, and expelled as a king is from his own kingdom and in whose place the most wicked robber has been elected and honored.
A few Sox fans–I say only a few because generally we fans are pretty open-minded, except for when we’re dealing with that New York team that begins with the letter Y–a few of the other denizens of our hotel were freaked out, but I’m clueless as to why. I mean how many of us non-furries buy cereal because it’s got a Tiger on the cover, or keep a furry mascot on our rearview mirror–and talk to it–or engage in long back and forth conversations with our dogs?

I’ve seen many women engage in Busyness Battles with each other. We ask each other what seems like such a simple question, such as “What have you been up to lately?” or “Have you been busy?” Then, like a Wild West shootout, we breathlessly list our every activity in an effort to “out-busy” the other woman. The prize? The personal pride that we are more stressed than the woman we are talking to. Don’t be embarrassed to concede defeat and say, “Well, I’ve been focusing on de-stressing. On Sunday, I watched a movie with my family and then read some of my book.” You may have lost the shoot-out, but who wants the title of “Most Stressed Woman” anyway?
Quoting ‘Trudy’ in “Lost and Found”; “I am willing to sacrifice finding my biological mother rather than risk hurting my parents.”(p.180) Underlying these sentiments is a fear of appearing ungrateful, and this is where the status of adoptee as a ‘chosen’ or ‘saved’ child can come back to haunt the entire family. Society at large has picked up on this gratitude theme and often uses it to beat unsuspecting adoptees over the head. I am sure that many of us have seen, or perhaps even written or said, some variation on this theme: “Who held you when you were sick, changed your diapers, kissed your boo-boos, fed you, clothed you….???” Of course, most of us bear some measure of gratitude towards our parents, but for the adoptee, the expectation hangs heaviest over the decision to search, as if that decision is in itself, a choosing, a taking of sides, a question of loyalty.
But realize that you are not alone. Most of us have been through it, and we can all get through it together.

In that last photo you can barely make out these basalt rock columns in the side of the cliff. As we were climbing out of the causeway back to the car park, we came across the massive hexagonal columns in the side of the cliff. As I wrote in my journal at the time, the pictures we have don’t do justice to what you see when you’re there. The whole park is something that truly has to be seen to be appreciated. I kept saying on the drive up that I hoped it was worth the time and effort getting up there and that the whole thing wouldn’t be a bust. I can honestly say that it was well worth the time and effort to get up to the Giant’s Causeway.

I am sad to report that after three months of faithful service, my iPod Touch has met an untimely end. As I was climbing out of my friend’s car this afternoon, the iPod leapt from my back pocket (along with my cell phone) and fell screen side down on the pavement. My cell phone, which I drop or unintentionally throw on at least a weekly basis, broke into four pieces but was easily reassembled. The iPod proved to be less hardy. When I picked it up and and flipped it over, it looked like this:

Hey, we've all been there) so even though he has a duty-free store full of spirits in his Antique(tm) Chinese (tm) shelves, these offered no great temptation. Wine? Well, he's just come back from a Barossa wine splurge, so this was tough, wine fridge full to bursting with amazing old vine Shiraz's and GSMs, and you name it. Let them age a bit more, let's pick one every now and then, for a special occasion.

During this past Holiday Season, starting around the end of November, Cambria seemed to be having a really difficult time. She was acting out a lot more, getting angry, doing things she knows she shouldn't, making messes she knows she shouldn't, and the worst one of all...she started having accidents during the day and night time. She has been potty trained for months now and we had no clue why she was suddenly having such a difficult time. It seemed like the more upset we got at the messes and bad behavior, the worse it got. Finally, one day I sat down at the computer and just started searching the Internet for ADD children symptoms and solutions. Almost everything I found said that the most important thing to have in place for an ADD child is structure. Their mind lacks the normal structure setup and so as a parent, you need to create that for them.
Just wanted to put a little something out there about this week! It is coming up fast and is near and dear to my heart as you all know or hopefully have read by now if you have perused our other articles.

Zymurgy is great for homebrewers, and although I homebrew, I've stopped calling myself a homebrewer. Maybe it's just that it's challenging for me to carve out 8 hours of a day to brew beer, or that we live far enough out in the suburbs that my three kegs will have the same beer in it for months. But I just don't homebrew enough to get 'er done.
I see them as integrated into my life and as part of me–but I don’t give them my heart… I give my mind to them.. and my body.. but my emotions–they are so secondary in most of my experience–that they aren’t really something that I either can or feel is appropriate to give…

Lovingly dedicated to one of the greatest cats of all time, Maurice. He was named after the old Steve Miller song, wherein Some people call me Maurice/Cause I speak of the pompitous of love. He sure did. But mostly he would "slink down the alley looking for a fight/Howling to the moonlight on a hot summer night." I owned Maurice at the time the song came out, and used to sing it to him. (He knew the song was all about him.)

I've had more than one table dropped on my head, forgotten to pack underwear when out on the road, and tripped on my own tongue too many times to count. We'll have 'em falling outta their Barcaloungers with tales of our misadventures in miscues, missed turns, and misbehavin'...to say nothing of flat hair, flat beer, flat broke, and plenty of flat tires.

Greeks and Romans believed in astrology as a predicative and analytical tool of human behavior of past and future. As analytical tool astrology will confirm certain behavior patterns and matches them with the hundreds of mathematical algorithms used derived from Natal Chart to predict such past behavior based on birth time and place. Future predicative behavior assumes a continuum of life in one form or other, consequences of past actions of individual or society long time after the individual or society are gone in to oblivion. AS analytical tool astrology confirms a particular set of algorithms used in natal chart and as predicative tool it utilizes those confirmed set of algorithms to predict future behavioral choices or actionable patterns. Few actions have immediate perceivable results like firing a bullet and killing a person. Few actions have consequences spread over centuries. Destroying the forests or ecology polluting rivers may not affect populations in next few years but alter the growth of human civilization for ever for coming centuries. Same way societal actions also effect long term consequences for centuries to come. But the question whether one will fire a bullet or not or one destroys nature or ecology for narrow selfish profit or not lies in the realm of predicative astrology.

5) As a ritual, it provides a regular point of connection as a family. I’ve always held family meals as sacred, and am loathe to give many of them up during the week, unless it’s to share them with friends (friends are always welcome!). Playing games at the meal table extends that time together, and makes it feel even more like a special occasion.

The wine menu I could at least read. The red and white wine was clear, the region and grape variety I could also read. Being able to read it and understand it however are not one and the same thing. I noticed other punters were able to buy a tray of mixed wines in small measures. Similar to buying a meter of Kolsch beer in 20cl glasses in a tray. So I picked one of them and found a seat among the locals to neck my grog and polish off my jumbo sized hotdog.
The movie is based on the Leopold and Loeb murder case, two young men in Chicago who murdered a 14-year-old boy to demonstrate their intellectual superiority. It has often been argued that the two murderers were lovers. Montgomery Clift was offered Granger’s role in Rope but turned it down, quite possibly because he feared the light it would shine on his own proclivities; indeed, Clift turned down Sunset Boulevard for similar reasons, because of his involvement with the much-older singer Libby Holman. Granger, who at age 22 had already embarked on a lifelong pursuit of both men and women, had no such hesitation. He later said that he always considered himself a working actor, not a star, and Granger didn’t fear the homoerotic subtext of either of the films he did for Hitchcock.

You have to also take into account that she turned three right before they started preschool. She is the youngest in the class. Most of the other kids turned 4 a while ago so if you are comparing an early three to a late three early four than you are comparing apples to oranges. I say this because there are some things such as cutting with scissors that just take time. The number one reason I placed her in preschool is for the social interaction. I wanted her to be with kids her own age and not just her sister. She prefers older kids to ones her age but she is getting better. She participates in all the activities they do and she does play with her friends. I think there may be some anxiety there. I think she may feel overwhelmed. Prayerfully, as I continue to put her in social situations with large groups of her peers she will feel more comfortable.

Similarly, Snowdon points out that high imprisonment rates in countries considered unequal was less to do with incomes and more to do with government policy. By looking at crime rates instead, the same reasoning used by Wilkinson and Pickett could equally prove that egalitarian countries suffer more from crime ... because they don't jail those who commit it as much as their unequal counterparts.

Why bring up nationalities? It has been long held that foreign players were the biggest source of this cheating yet English football through the years has had its fair share of players who fall to earth all too quickly. Indeed, the most recent culprits in the Premier League tend to be natives: Rooney, Gerrard, Young to name but three. All England interationals, all escaping the wider mauling that has been heaped on Arsenal players by the insidious Fleet Street xenophobia.
There were many questions demanding answers, and things started getting difficult. With great beers all around, both from near and from far, how does one differentiate choices in the absence of pockets deep enough to stock 1,000 beers -- or even 300?

The project I'm really excited about at the moment are these mittens I started knitting last night. The cuffs are done with corrugated ribbing, which I had never tried before. I haven't done stranded knitting of any kind in quite awhile so at first it felt like I was knitting with two left hands with all thumbs. But, once I got the hang of it, I was zipping along pretty well. I found the pattern on Ravelry. If you knit or crochet and haven't discovered Ravelry yet, be sure to pay them a visit. The site has tons of patterns, forums, blogs, groups, databases that let you catalog your yarn stash and supplies, and project albums. It literally took me days to explore the whole site!
I got 9 or 10 kills. One of my favorite kills was Jason. We had called a temporary truce to play Zombie Dice together. WE sat at the same table and played together for an HOUR at least. Then I ran upstairs and changed my look from normal ex-soccer mom to goth chic. I came back downstairs, and walked past him. THEN when I knew he didn't recognize me I walked up and asked him about the game he was watching while I draped my arm around him, shiv'd him in the back and asked for my kill sheet. :)
and now I am showing you not so pretty pictures, but I like seeing progress in our home.
Rumbold Builders is represented by solicitors, Noel Smyth and Partners. And as we all know by now, Noel Smyth is a developer as well as a solicitor and was behind the development of The Square shopping centre in Tallaght. Noel is now a NAMAed developer and has seen his art collection handed over to the Agency. It is not clear if Noel is himself dealing with this case, but if he is, he is presumably clocking up the airmiles at an impressive rate given his relocation to an address in south London – not as a precursor to declaring bankruptcy in the UK, Noel assures us.
Howard, however, was perfect on the phone, and always good for a stimulating conversation. It is a good thing that these talks, which in our earlier days could go deep into the night, were not long distance. They could have bankrupted both of us. Perhaps kindred to it was his admirably cozy way of chairing both the drama critics’ and film critics’ circles, which no one else has ever straddled.
Oddly, I still like to shut closet doors before I go to sleep. There’s something about having them open that I’ve never liked. I suspect I’m not alone in this. Perhaps there are some childhood fears we never quite grow out of.
The outer court was surrounded by a linen fence. This is where sacrifices were offered, and anyone could come, Jew or Gentile. For the average person, this is as far as they could come in God’s mobile temple. There was some fellowship here, since people could pray, worship, hear the Torah read once every three years, and have their sacrifices offered. Still, compared to the cohen (priests), the average person had an extremely limited availability to the Shechina presence of God which dwelled in the Tabernacle.
It is all I can ask of myself, enough to be happy but keep the loathing at bay.

This isn’t a fair trade-off. Now I’m forced into actually watching weather reports on RTE, BBC and Sky, and reading the Farmer’s Almanac to see if there’s the slightest possibility this rumour could be just trash talk. A few things I’ve noted: the worse the weather, the more avant-garde Jean Byrne’s clothing choices. Good call on the use of metallics when telling us global warming has dealt us the short straw.

Some put on a suit, put up a slogan, and sell hope of "success", whatever that means. Some setup a blackboard, a whipping stick, and sell bundles of lessons and how-to's, until you want to burp out "shall"s and "shall-not"s and say enough already. Some sell illicit goods, red lantern hung up high, shadowy figure moving about behind halfhearted curtains. Some rolled up carts full of inspirations, setting up shops for the soul without fanfare. Some sell books, pages, and words, whatever you might make of them. Some sell poems, a league all of their own, more of an exchange. Some, just hanging out, chilled out. But most of all, people set up a doorway here to give directions and maps to their other shops, whatever or wherever those might be.

The following are the inscriptions:- 'Beneath are deposited the mortal remains of the Rev. Eugene Kelly, who laboured well in the sacred ministry for 44 years, during the last 31 of which he was the vigilant and zealous pastor of Doonane and Mayo. Having by word and example taught his flock the blessedness of walking blamelessly in the way of the Lord, this good priest, upon Easter Sunday, 1859, closed his earthly career in the precious peace procured by the bright hope which sustains the faithful Christian. Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.-Apoc. xiv."

It is tough for me to write about "Inception", not just due to entering a two week old debate that I consider mostly rancid, but, more importantly, I am absolutely perplexed that this film has actually deserved this fervor.

This movie is the very definition of middling.

This first time out, though, the comedic device of people sitting on pigs is the source of linking material. Frankly, I think it's poorly played the first time (not well-performed by Graham Chapman, also some poorly synced sound), though later on in the episode it's quite funny. Maybe it's the repetition. The idea of repetition being a simple gag for humor would be taken to its most bizarre next season, but that's...well...next season.

I know I have said my kids do that, but they only do so much. They are older, require less care, and I don’t have to push my body so hard. I think photography saved my life two years ago. It gave me something that made me feel like a productive human again. I didn’t start advertising or trying to make a career out of it until about eight months ago. Until then, it was a hobby. Trial and error. Learning what worked and what didn’t. And it gave me time to find a professional print lab that turned out quality prints at an affordable price! My goal was to bring quality, professional prints to the masses that anyone could afford, and I think I did that! So now I am just hoping it takes off and I can stay in business enough to pay for a studio! I also needed something that didn’t require a lot of physical exercise that I could actually do, and photography gave me that!

The reason for this is that there is great genetic variation in hops, and seedlings are very seldom like the parents. Ian Hornsey (2) writes:"Because the sexes are separate the species is highly heterozygous with the resulting extreme morphological variability of plants that are raised from seeds. This causes problems for the commercial grower who strive for consistency. For this reason, therefore, a commercial grower will propagate the crop vegetatively, there being three major methods:

We arrived at the little church, and God began to move on my mother’s heart. During the altar service, my mother became desperate for God, and as we prayed for her, suddenly I heard something that caused me to leap from my chair: my mother began speaking in other tongues as the Spirit gave her the utterance. I was overjoyed! Later as I hugged her, she kept saying, “It’s so real! It’s so real! It’s so real!” My joy only increased as I saw the experience dramatically change her life.

As Moses prayed thousands of years ago, “So teach us to number our days, that we may present to You a heart of wisdom” (Psalm 90:12). Lord, teach me to number my days so that if you bless me with another 33 years You will be more glorified in my life, family, and ministry than You are now. Lord, teach me to number my days so that if I died tomorrow as some of Your faithful servants died at a young age, that others would be encouraged to live for You by my memory. Oh, may we not look back at the end of our lives and say that we wasted them! Are you making the best use of your time?

The adversary of your soul is certainly watching for your faith to fail. He is looking to take your stuff (Job 1:10-11) and attack your body (Job 2:4) in an attempt to pull you from the foundation of Jesus Christ. Don’t let him have the pleasure. Job remained faithful throughout the worst testing I can find in His Word. He lost everything he had and almost everyone that he loved in an instant only to then be attacked physically. Yet his faith in God endured. Job waited on God and He arrived with a double portion for His Beloved. Just as satan is waiting for you to fall, God is looking at you for confident faith. He IS working EVERYTHING according to His Goodness, Grace and Glory for you. He is going to give you back EVERYTHING the enemy stole from you (I Samuel 30:7, I Samuel 30:18-19) and His Treasure in Heaven if you will just wait and patiently endure this test! You will win!

Here’s one that I found in Bill Granger’s “Everyday Asian” recipe book for a beautiful corn soup. (Since buying this book, I have made several recipes from it and without fail, they’ve all been terrific, with spot on instructions, so I highly recommend this one if you like Asian dishes made easy.) It took me about 15 minutes to make the soup from start to finish (how’s that for quick?). Instead of using fresh corn as per the recipe, I used frozen, and not only was it delicious, but it cut about 10 minutes out of the prep time. And on top of it all, it’s parev!

I'm one of those people who is a sucker for a really good nature documentary, the kind produced by the BBC and narrated by someone on the order of David Attenborough. If you've ever tried to take pictures in nature you know how excruciatingly painstaking it is. You might once in your nautical life catch a glimpse of a school of fish compacting itself and swimming into a tight ball. To capture that perfectly on film is a wonder to behold.
It's the same with scars we may carry on our heart. The Lord heals our heart, but it's true that we may carry some consequences from our past sins. We have our memories of who we were before Christ came into our lives, and some may be downright ugly. The Lord is so good to make our hearts new, but to leave these little reminders so that we can be grateful for how much He has changed our lives. And we can use our experiences of where we came from to help others.

We are surrounded by chickens…seas of them. We let Effel out with her 9 babies and she promptly got one of them dispatched to the next world. At the moment she has 8 with her still and we figure that it’s survival of the fittest out there. The silver Wyandotte still has 3 babies in the side garden and as long as she stays there I dare say she will keep them. I think one of the second batch of feral chicks that Houdini raised outside the normal hen societal model (the mainstream hens that head to the coop each night…) has gone the same way as Effel’s baby. It’s a pity because it was the only Wyandotte of the lot and most probably a hen. We have 4 roosters that are going to have to be dealt with at some day in the future in that bunch. Steve is in Launceston today doing the fortnightly shopping. When you live 50km away from the nearest shops you tend to really think about your shopping requirements and make sure that you have enough to last you through. I find it interesting to see how our shopping habits have changed incredibly since we moved from Riverside 4km away from the City centre. We are spending a lot more time at home and a lot more time away from “normal” people. I can’t say I miss wading through the masses at the supermarket checkout or my heightened stress levels whenever I ventured out in the car. Tasmanians are NOT known for their ability to drive well or use their indicators and I am not known for my saintly patience and ability to acquiesce to other drivers especially when they are obviously idiots…I rest my case!
The Big Issue
On that day, it was hard for me to imagine a time I would have to say no to Barack Obama when he asked me for support. But last week, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus sat down with the president, and he asked us to vote for the health care reform bill — a bill that denies immigrants the opportunity to purchase health care with their own money. It was one more in a string of disappointments for the Hispanic community, and today, I no longer find myself able to confidently say “yes” when President Obama asks me for his support.

Putting my finger on any other bands that these guys might be similar to was pretty difficult. Based on the down-tuned riffing and chest imploding production job my initial thought was that they sound like a more punk version of France's Celeste. That's definitely a compliment because it's no easy feat to be as heavy as a band like Celeste, nor is it an easy feat to write hardcore punk songs that aren't regurgitated dogshit these days.

I met my clients at 2 pm on a Sunday afternoon at the park trailhead. Two very sweet ladies from Miami and Slovakia wanted to learn how to backpack. Melissa and Allison were eager to learn all I could teach and were quite fit so I knew this 12 mile loop would be an easy trip for them. As we loaded their backpacks at the trailhead we made sure they were not carrying too much and soon we were on our way. Sky was overcast and a cold front was on its way in, we would be lucky to get to camp before the rain started.

Photographing my last bird of the evening on the last evening of my trip made me feel a little sad. The phenomenon of spring migration along Lake Erie is addictive, and I knew tomorrow it would be very hard to walk away from the Magee Marsh boardwalk and the "easy pickin's" of its colorful neotropical songbirds. The only consolation was my farewell bird was a specific male Yellow Warbler that had been tugging at my heart all week. You may be wondering how it was possible to separate one male Yellow Warbler from the hundreds that sing and flit along on the boardwalk! Simple...he was the mate of a sweet little female who had been working nonstop to build her nest. This little male had to be the most dedicated Valentino on the boardwalk, serenading the industrious female with endless rounds of robust and lively song! I enjoyed watching the couple and learned a lot. Every now and then the female would abandon her work and the two would take off together, flying like mad through the branches of a huge old tree just across the boardwalk from her nest, but she'd never play around too long. Soon she was back to work, scouring the deep crevices in the craggy bark of that old tree looking for food, but mostly looking for spider silk that she would take back to her nest...
I really don't plan on making a habit of frequenting conventions the way I used to; to be perfectly honest, the only reason I went on Sunday was to visit The Lady and the Leopard in the dealers room, purveyors of period-inspired clothing and, mainly, corsets. I've decided this was the summer of corset-buying, something that's been put on the back-burner of my wardrobe-building for far too long. When Angelina posted on my local lolita community saying that the company she worked for would be selling at the convention, I certainly knew where a portion of my savings account would be going!
The hiring process for the store literally took three weeks. I took my first drug test ever (which is actually kind of weird and invasive, I think), and ended up getting hired on at $9/hour. I know I should be grateful that I have a job and that I got one so soon after my other jobs ended, but I guess my hopes and dreams can’t get over the fact that my perfect plan has been crushed and has resulted in me working in a store at $9/hour. I just spent over $60,000 on a college degree!!! Life lesson #1: Undergraduate degrees get you slighty-over-minimum-wage jobs at shops. What irks me more is that my stupidflippinguniform ended up costing me $107.97. Yes, that’s right. $21 for some shirt I will never wear if or when I leave this job, $19.97 for required khakis, $45 for solid black sneakers, $15 for a belt (which, really, will end up just being decoration on my stupid khaki pants because I don’t plan on actually tightening it; the pants already stay up fine as it is), and $7 for long socks. Last I checked I decided to take this job to make money, not to spend it unnecessarily.

All in all, in almost every measurable, Jeremy LaGarde improved on the marks belonging to Chris Barnes, suggesting that even though ETBU did not have a better record than UTD, they might have had the better player.

This produces an intensification of a dynamic that we’ve seen since at least the 1960s, where gay men (and queers generally) judge each other according to their presentability as “normal” to the watchful mainstream gaze. Gender nonconformity and any kind of femminess in gay men (or butchness in lesbians), sexual “promiscuity”, risky sex, kinky sex, group sex, anonymous hookups, public sex, leather, bondage, S/M, drag, etc., are all dangers to the normalization of gay-maleness and by extension to our equality.

Mauritania is the most Westerly of the Arab States. Sitting on the edge of the African continent, with the ocean as it’s Western boundary and the vast deserts of the Sahara to the East, Mauritania has not often made headlines since the days of the Paris-Dakar Rally, which came to an abrupt end in 2008 because of a “terrorist threat”. From that point, the big country with its tiny population faded from the mainstream news and drifted into the shadow realm of international security reports featuring Al Qaeda. That same year saw the latest in a succession of military coups d’état that have punctuated the political landscape since gaining independence from France in 1960. With tourism revenues almost wiped out, the suspension of international funding in response to the coup was devastating for the economy and popular protests called by political opposition leaders erupted in response. Almost four years later, tourists are still extremely rare, and funding – although largely restored – is rarely perceived as benefiting civil society. It is in the area of regional security that the Aziz regime has invested the majority of it’s time and resources, to the detriment of social welfare and economic development.

This is hard. I love so many songs that it's impossible to choose one. I'll go with my favorite at the moment which is Bitter Sweet Symphony from the band, The Verve.

Something about the song is haunting but beautiful, and has me playing it over and over. Seriously, go check it out, you might love it.

As I have indicated in earlier articles there is a short term benefit for the very rich from an endless flow of easily replaceable cheap labour which forces down wage costs and disempowers the native workforce, who dare not strike or demand rights when they know they can be so easily replaces. However, even the super rich are now realising the gains are short term. If there is any satisfaction to be gained from this situation it is contemplating how much money those evil and cynical old men have lost in migrant blighted countries like Greece, Portugal and Ireland.

As many of you are aware, leading Iranian government officials have opted to use their four-year break between vote-rigging efforts to attempt to develop nuclear "power plants of peace" which have absolutely nothing to do with a purely hypothetical desire to develop nuclear weapons (after all, why would a country with American troops occupying its eastern and western neighbors want nuclear weapons?). Recently, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has gone so far as to publicly call on Iran's nuclear agency to enrich Iran's uranium to "a high enough grade to piss off the West, but not high enough to break any international laws...yet" by year's end.

Bernard’s did not have a sale in mind; they had in 1954 refused an approach from a third party who was interested in purchasing the whole property together with the adjoining Ross’s Dairy. But they did agree to give Maitland a 10-year lease, “subject to the usual conditions”. At the time, the pub comprised a public bar, two sitting-rooms and a cellar. Today it’s open plan, but it’s not a big pub, so the sitting-rooms must have been quite small, what we would call a snug.

They showed us video made by people they are targeting. The videos were about the new and different ways these 20-somethings use media (by the way, anecdotal video like this has zero value as research, but that's another story.) Then they made the point that they will be using non-traditional media and creative strategies to reach these people. Only one problem. The average buyer of this product is 53 years old. They skipped over this fact so fast you'd think it was radioactive. In spite of the fact that their average customer is over 50, they have convinced themselves that this is a "youth" product. Not one person raised his hand and said "wait a minute."

Charlie dragged himself out of bed and shuffled over to the clothes his mother had laid out for him the night before. He was really too old for her to do this anymore, but he knew she got some sort of weird pleasure from dressing him. He pulled on some blue jeans and an Optimus Prime t-shirt and flexed his muscles in the mirror. Puny. No wonder Liz only had eyes for Brodie. He made being a 12-year-old boy look easy. His face never broke out, his voice never cracked, and braces only made him look better. All the girls swooned when he walked by in the hallway, breathing in the Axe smell that rolled off of him in waves. He even modeled tube socks for Modell’s. Liz didn’t even know Charlie existed. He sighed and trudged down the stairs.
The Painted Veil was a movie I saw and loved so much that I rushed out to buy the novel as soon as I had rewatched the rented dvd numerous times. The film, which was so moving in it’s depiction of cholera ridden China, with it’s haunting bleakness that somehow helped transform a vain and shallow woman into something so much more. I read, but to no avail; the novel inspired nothing in me but a vague sense of disappointment. I don’t know why I hate to admit it but.. the movie was better.
I'll thank you if you stop hitting me, now.
The bus deposits us in front of the church. Within minutes, the distant rain, the blur over Bohol we saw moments ago, suddenly closes in. A volley of raindrops envelops the town with a delicate mantle of haze. The column of clouds is now upon us. We scamper to the rectory beside the church for shelter.

By 1969 the pair were performing as a duo, with Seals on guitar, saxophone and violin, and Crofts on guitar and mandolin. A couple of unsuccessful albums followed before they signed with Warner Bros. Records. Their second album for Warners - Summer Breeze - sold over one million copies and reached number 7 on the Billboard chart. The title track is best known, certainly in the UK, for being covered by the Isley Brothers.
I had a lovely time in Seattle. It's such a pretty place, all dark green hills and blue bay and a sudden spikeyness of skyscrapers under a vast wash of lavender cloud. And the continual astonishments, to my British eyes, of all the streets being at right angles, and all the houses being different from each other. And it was sunny nearly all the time and I was staying with people I love and who love me back. They fed me and housed me and drove me around with their usual generosity and joy, and I sat with my dear friend and knitted. The thing in the picture is called the Space Needle.

Could you imagine a clothesline being banned in 1950? With our global environmental "crisis", saving energy should be a priority for the health of our planet. Right? Now everyone is more worried about what their houses & yards "look" like, and don't seem to care if they pay $150.00 per month in energy bills. Where did our freedom go? Where did our senses go?

Actually, at this point I have finished the planning portion of the project I have been given to manage and am now in full swing project-doing. The project-doing phase has required me to move down from the shiny, cushy, corporate HQ office tower to a satellite call center, located close enough to my apartment that I can walk to work. Although my commute is much improved, I'm having trouble adjusting from the professional, corporate culture to which I have become accustomed, to the elementary school level environment of the call center.

Lately, my kitchen mojo has been faltering and I have had to make many things a couple of times or try a few different recipes to get an end product that I could eat again and again, so it’s not surprising to me that this cookie tested the last few flickers of hope that my kitchen mojo would return. As you may recall, the first time I wrote about peanut butter cookies was a couple of months ago and those cookies were a little too dry and didn’t hold their shape – a good taste but they were only good fresh out of the oven and crumbled when you picked them up the next day. Then I tried again, with a different recipe whose ingredient list required more wet ingredients, allowing the cookie to hold its shape better, but cracked all over regardless of how it was shaped and was too soft and never quite firmed up… until a couple of days later when it would crumble also. So imagine my reluctance when I saw this recipe in The Art & Soul of Baking by Cindy Mushet – but because I have been on a mission to find the best of the recipes for the things I like to bake, eat and giveaway, I had to make these… kind of a last-ditch effort.

Asked whether the area was blighted, a requirement for the expected use of eminent domain, Gargano’s answers were fuzzy. He noted that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s Vanderbilt Yard is “not utilized today,” though actually it’s a functioning railyard, which will be moved.

Pat: I’d still pursue traditional publishers first. They have the ability to bring a book to a much broader audience than a self-published e-book. They can land you reviews and interviews that most people can’t get on their own. I think it’d possibly be a little easier to get published now, because there’s a more established niche for paranormal romance/love stories than there was when I was taking this out initially.

Blake gets involved with Marissa's heartache inadvertently. He takes a photo of a homeless woman who turns out to be Marissa's meth addicted mother.

Crikey, if I took up all these offers of coffee, I’d astral project. And Polly Harvey – another eeek, musically somewhat of an acquired taste and a fair ways from mine. Tina and I meander down the stairs to be met by a barrage of discordal noise. Blackwell said once that PJ had wanted to sign to Island because of Tom Waits – that’s all very well, but while Tom’s music is also something of an acquired taste, at least he has amazing songs.
He assured them that He had to go away. They should have been expecting it. But the departure was unusual and they stood there gazing after him just as we do many times when a loved one leaves us. Perhaps at the airport when your husband or wife has to leave for a time. You kiss goodbye and that loved one is off to board the plane. It takes off and you continue watching it until it is totally out of sight and still you linger and watch. That was the physical and mental condition of the twelve disciples. They were gazing steadfastly into heaven as we read in Acts 1:10. As they so looked, two men stood by them in white apparel “Which also said, Ye men ofGalilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven?”
...and once again the project details:
It’s all a question of probability and risk. Rapley once put it to me this way. You are putting your daughter on a plane. The pilot tells you there is a 1-in-100 chance it will crash. You, if you have any sense, take your daughter off the plane. Why? Because the potential loss is so great that 1 in 100 is unacceptable. So it is with global warming — except the down side probability is a good deal higher than 1 in 100.
Ten minutes and a clean face later, I was ready. To be honest, I wasn’t expecting much. But the mood is a use-it-or-lose sort of thing, so I decided to just go with it. Glass of wine in hand, I finally committed…to what turned out to be an unexpectedly fulfilling little chick flick, “Friends with Benefits.”
1330 Report that a 4 year old child had been found on the Boulevard adjacent to the Tennis Centre. Security attended and spoke to the child. The child was asked where their parents were the child pointed to the DHL Pavilion. Security took the child to the Pavilion where the mother was identified. The mother was eating a meal. She did not thank Security for removing the child from the side of the road or returning the child to her. She told the child not to do it again and continued eating her meal.
“Wonder what that was all about?” I asked my husband. He said the man didn’t have good use of his legs. He had seen him crawl out of the room (obviously a specially-equipped dressing area) and laboriously make his way to the end of the pool, where the life guard helped him with a special seat that lowered the man into the water. Once in the pool, he was able to do a form of swimming unassisted.
When I returned from Fizzing about I made a dedicated trip to the local SmartyPets store to buy 4 cases of canned dog food for my aging Spaniel. His teeth are down to nubs so crunching kibble is a thing of the past. This sweet, sweet animal still spins joy circles every time he sees me. With or without the food bowl. I am always willing to make the journey across town to purchase the food he most enjoys.
I’ve not written about fathers in this post because, to be honest, it’s very rare to come across one who is tied into knots over every aspect of his parenting, even among stay-at-home dads. Of course, it could be a function of our notorious unwillingness to confess weakness, especially to other men, but I suspect it has much more to do with the fact that we aren’t as burdened with the weight of historical expectations. Men tend to be “graded” as parents almost exclusively on effort and earnestness, which in my view is really how it should be for parents of either gender.
I acknowledge freely that I need grace more often than I want to admit. I need you to love me because you know that I am doing my best, even though in some moments my best isn’t very good. I try to make up for that when my best is shining bright.
OK I admit it – my nearly-three-year-old daughter is more familiar with iPads than I am. It’s not hard – I think I have only just fully realised I am raising a “screen-ager”. Once they started appearing at her preschool, I should have realised that if I didn’t catch up soon, I was going to be left behind; and possibly speaking an entirely different language according to the latest scrabble dictionary!

As a label, I’m trying to mutualise means between my artists. I’m trying to be the third party that will help them achieving their goals, among which having CDs out, sure, but not only that. It has always been the point, anyway: having your bands touring, etc., but it just became more and more important. Let’s hope they’ll understand that answering interviews or playing gigs is far more important than having a CD out if they have a good album and are backed up by a great team.

Speaking of Kolsch, theirs is exceptional and I was told it will be their first bottled beer (and will be available in the Market of Choice chain statewide). This is a great call, nice counter-programming from all the IPAs out there. Their Kolsch is less spicy than DMs, but clean, refreshing and nicely balanced. It is also crystal clear making me wonder if it was filtered. The barkeep was not sure.

Jessie was aware she was lividly frozen in the chair, the only parts of her body that seemed to move were her eyes and fingers. She came upon the cardboard packet she had found on the window sill in his room. She opened it. One cigarette left. She looked at it. She had never smoked. She had known the smell of a married man, the whiff of whiskey, the scent of tobacco, the sour odour of both. Her husband rarely brushed his teeth. When he kissed her, he had a rotten taste: the kiss lasted, not always in a pleasant fashion. She rolled this, his last cigarette in her stubby fingers and put its tip to her lips and she sucked it in, unlit. Her cheeks were, immediately, lined with tears. She breathed in deeply and then removed the cigarette, small flakes of leaf speckling her lips. She spat them out babyishly, making the most polite raspberry. He will not come back.The crowded cast-list is perfect for providing the hustle and bustle of a busy and opulent household, the kind of setting that we have been enjoying once again on television with series like Downton Abbey and Upstairs, Downstairs. It is the perfect background noise to show the shocked state of John Conrad as he moves around the house, his birthday celebrations obliterated by grief and his own senses suffering the same confusion that must come to the boxer who has been caught square on the jaw.

Where did the time go? I am sitting here wondering what happened to all the time. She is such a sweet girl. I know everybody thinks that about their kids, but really she is.
I don’t mind it too much – except that I fear that people touch my stomach and all they feel is fat. And also, often when I see people I haven’t seen in a while, it’s at a Zumba meet, so I’m generally covered in sweat – so they touch it, then feel the need to shower.

I am a big fan of pilfering ideas, maps, and locales from various published adventure modules and gaming publications. While the Lands of Ara is to some extent a full-fledged game world, with many basic assumptions built in and many others organically accruing over time, it has always also been a place into which I can ungraciously shoehorn a modified map from a Gygax module, a random encounter idea horked from Jeff Rients' blog, and/or an entire megadungeon by Michael Curtis. To me this "sampling" is absolutely integral to my DM'ing process: not only do I enjoy buying, reading, and raiding other creative people's RPG'ing products, but I am also a fairly half-assed and slapdash preparer, so when the PCs suddenly decide to visit a place I haven't yet mapped, it is great fun for me to just choose an old TSR module and use (parts of) that. In short, I like allowing significant input from outside sources, sometimes randomly generated, sometimes deliberately planted, to infuse Ara with elements that exceed the limits of my own imagination.

I believe the Sixties ended between April 4 and June 6, 1968. By the following year, the music charts were in transition- awash in sickly nostalgia, half-baked social commentary, frustration, wishful thinking and Creedence. What blended seamlessly in 1967 appears factionalized by ’69. Here’s the Billboard Top 40 singles for 1969:
Advent. I asked the kids (both now officially bigger than me, at ages 17 and 14) if they wanted an Advent calendar. They said yes. I bought the ubiquitous chocolate-filled cardboard calendar, at a suspiciously cheap price of $5. I checked that it was “made in Canada” and not in China. Nevertheless, the chocolate was so crummy that my son ran outside to spit it in the driveway. Advent Fail. On the other hand, I have been touched by some of the Advent offerings posted on facebook by my friends, including glorious music by the Mediaeval Baebes, and a frenetic and surreal liturgical dance by Steven Colbert, which I find somehow deeply spiritual, perhaps because I know that in spite of his hilarious cynicism, he is an ardent Catholic and Sunday School teacher. Advent win.

An unusual thing happened today. Kiba got bathed! And her foot hair trimmed. And her toenails clipped (well, that part isn't unusual). And she got brushed! I'm sure that's not unusual for many dogs, but for a smooth-coated border collie owned by myself, it is VERY unusual. She didn't really understand all the primping and preening going on, but she is a really good sport and withstood everything without complaining. Now she smells nice, and is so sparkly in the sun that she made me think of Edward Cullen out on our walk! (I laughed at myself for thinking that one!)
I put it all on my pretty hydrangea tea tray and escaped to my TV room, where I curled up on the leather couch to watch my all-time favorite movie. What movie is that, you ask? Well, here's a scene from it.

Were we to travel to the birthplace of the English language, yes, England, we would not be at home as one would expect as our languages are very different indeed. I lived in England for a time and found that when I needed to speak more English-English, I used my mouth and tongue more. We Americans have lazy mouths! Who knew? It actually takes work to pronounce words correctly. Here is an example of the words that caused me confusion and embarrassment at times:

Isn't our choice really not one of left or right, but of up or down? Down through the welfare state to statism, to more and more government largesse accompanied always by more government authority, less individual liberty and, ultimately, totalitarianism, always advanced as for our own good. The alternative is the dream conceived by our Founding Fathers, up to the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with an orderly society. We don't celebrate dependence day on the Fourth of July. We celebrate Independence Day.
They’re called the Galilean moons, of course, because Galileo discovered them four hundred years ago when he pointed a small telescope at the sky. The sight shook up the world! At that time most folks believed the Earth was at the center of the universe and everything revolved around it. A bit conceited, perhaps, but darn, watch the sky on any given night and it sure looks like we’re at the center of things! But here comes Professor Galileo with his new-fangled looking glass, and he points it at the bright “wandering star,” Jupiter, and what he sees is another world. Not only is it another world but a world with four little worlds clearly whirling around it! And of course he rushes right into print with this astounding discovery publishing his “Sidereus Nuncius” or “Starry Messenger” in March of 1610. Today many amateur astronomers enjoy studying details on this largest of planets. I love watching Jupiter’s four brightest moons. Here’s why:
Commonly used illegal drugs can seriously harm the heart and should never be used. Even stimulants like ephedra and decongestants like pseudoephedrine can be harmful to patients with hypertension or heart disease.
It sounds funny, but one of the best things that could ever happen to me was when I lost my faith for a few years. The devil attacked me in a way I didn’t know he could, and he was so clever at it that I didn’t even know it was him doing it, and it began a chain-reaction that led me to turn my back on God. It took several years before I acknowledged there was a Powerful Source that must have created everything. It only made sense. We did not “evolve” from apes or tadpoles or any other created being. Someone had to create those other beings and Someone had to create me. So I began to address that Someone. Eventually my searching began in earnest for the Truth. I went down many wrong roads and got into some spiritually dangerous and frightening situations until I literally had the hell scared off of me, turned around and ran back to God. He was waiting right behind me the whole time, with His arms stretched out wide to receive me!! I was back where I belonged!! Then I began searching in the right place. Having burned all my bibles, commentaries, dictionaries and notes I was given an unused Bible by a friend. I sat down and said, “God, I need You to show me Who You are. Not what I’ve been taught, but Who You truly are.” I was addressing, my Abba, God the Father. I read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation and then I knew Who God the Father was. By then, my belief in Jesus had returned. Once again, I sat down and said, “Jesus, I need You to show me Who You are. I don’t need to learn ‘stories’ about You. I need to know the real You.” I reread the Bible front to back. Then I realized I never truly knew Who the Holy Spirit was. So I turned to Him next and said, “Holy Spirit, please tell me Who You are. I really don’t know!!” Once more I read the entire Bible. When I was finished, I discovered that I had really only just begun. Now that I knew Who God was from the words of the Scriptures written by the Holy Spirit, God was going to begin to show me day by day on what has been a long, hard, terrifying, blessed, blissful, excruciatingly painful, wondrous, amazing, tear-filled, heart-broken, stronger-than-ever-before odyssey that has led me to the best place I’ve ever been in my entire life. A place of such intimacy with Jesus that I never knew existed. A place of such satisfying contentment that I never thought I’d find here on earth. A place of such peace and calmness that I’d only glimpsed on occasion and tasted pieces of that left me longing for more and more, yet was so elusive to my desperate grasp. A place that every human being who has ever been born, is being born right this second and who will be born in the future is longing for with their entire being: A place where that God hole is filled up to overflowing with the Only One Who is capable of filling that empty space up completely with Himself.

Today I were walking through town with Party Time when this crazy old man coming toward us in the opposite direction (this was going along Wellington Place) stops this oul doll, a fat valuer-sporting millie, and a youngster stuck between them both, holding granny and mummy's hand (for that was the scene), and the crazy old man, he leans down to the youngster (a boy), and takes his head between his hands, gently, and starts to moo at him and scrunch up his face all sentimental and sad like, then he screams, right in the boy's face “That's the badger!” And just like that he goes on, doing a twirl and mumbling to himself a happy ditty – then, as he draws up level with us, he laughs and groans and laughs and groans over and over again, - his frame goes all loose and he looks skyward, curling his fingers up, thrusting his hands up in the air imploringly toward a greater power. I look past him and I see the youngster has appeared to have passed out and is being dragged along by the granny and mummy to their great consternation. I am linking the two. Thinking the crazy old man happened to have caused the unconsciousness of the youngster through the power of thought alone.
I've been back at my home base in Denver for a few months now and my silence on the blog has been my way to transition back into 'normal' life. I've been far from idle, of course, and just walking around the city to all the things I keep myself busy with adds up to about 50 or 60 miles every week.

The classical findings are of a fever which is followed after a few days with small blister lesions on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They can also occur in other areas, but hands and feet are most common. The mouth is affected too with these blister lesions, and when they burst the raw surface produces a shallow ulcer that is very painful but heals well without any long term consequence.

In the 1950s, Brazilian television was marked by informality, since there were no trained professionals in the country with any experience in this media field. Another characteristic of television productions of this early period was live impromptu, once there was no videotape. The high costs of TV sets, which were imported, restricted the access of the media to the urban elites of major cities.Technical resources were primary, offering broadcasters just enough to keep the stations on the air. It was during that period that TV news and telenovelas were established.[1]

Those scores represent a significant decrease from 2009, the last year Global Integrity covered the US, and reflect the negative impact of the "Citizens United" Supreme Court decision in early-2010 that loosened the controls over private money flowing into US elections. Despite that backsliding, the US remains at the head of the pack when it comes to the disclosure of political finance information to the public (94 out of 100).

Hey everyone! I was hoping to do another server review for you today but unfortunately the server I was planning to do a post on, it’s called Cobble Town, is not working very well. I’m not sure why but there has been a constant lag on the server for the last couple days. I was able to get on today and take one quick preview picture for you and then I had to disconnect before the lag drove me crazy.

Our vet laughed when we told him this and said he had never seen a dog go up the stairs backwards. But Boscoe is a very very smart dog, a border collie, the smartest of the smart, and he figured out that it was easier on his old joints if he pushed off from his front legs, which were still strong, rather than his back legs, which were not.

And it's all for a reaaaaallly good price. The cheap, heifer in me LOVES this part of the deal.

- and that's as far as I got with this post. I got distracted by nights out and parties and friendship-bracelet making sessions, etc, etc, and I forgot all about it. But allow me to continue. The thing I was going to say about expat friendships is that you have a smaller 'pond' of people from which to choose your friends and that is not always a bad thing. I have made friends with people who 'back home' I would probably not have given a chance to and therefore would have missed out on the different things that they can bring to a friendship. I've made friends with some very different, but very interesting people, so if there's one thing to take out of this foreign experience it's that I will hopefully be more open to making friends from all walks of life and not necessarily just go for people who on the surface seem 'my type'. Don't get me wrong, there have still been people who we have met and gone out with and thought afterwards that we just didn't like enough to want to hang out with- that's just life. But what I think we all hope for, is that we meet someone who shares our ideals, our sense of humour, or likes and dislikes, our cultural history perhaps: someone in other words who might just be a perfect friend.
Actually, it's none of the above - the reason I know that winter is officially over here in Paris and that summer is on its way is because the city is starting to fill with tourists.

Another one of my favorite quick chants for getting kids quiet for the hallway is:
They are somewhat unrelated though. I like the ideas that the Dhali Lama speaks of, peace and world unity and how that is important to our daily lives. I am interested on his take of Science and Religion though and that without one you cannot see the whole picture. That the world we live in requires the understanding or acceptance of both and we cannot live our lives without one. I look forward to getting to explore that. As for the Bible I feel that it is time that I learn the lessons my Grandfather would have passed on to me had he still been alive through my childhood. Words of God and of being a good person. In doing so I feel that I must therefore understand why I was named the way I was. The words of King David and his son Solomon, as well as Jeremiah all from my name sake. I think that is what he wanted me to learn from, at least that is where some of his lessons must have been derived from. I can’t learn his meanings on my own but it seems like the best place to start. I just hope I don’t miss to much, because honestly somedays I have no idea where I am going or what I am supposed to do and he always seemed like the type to have advice. I wish I got to know him better. I really do. Maybe this will at least help me know him somehow.

It didn't take a lesbian mom to provide the key to solving our napping problems (though in fact, it was one who did so), and I don't mean to slight the many non-LGBT folks whose blogs I read. But there is something irreplaceable and maybe even healing about seeing the queer part of our lives (and of the lives we aspire to) reflected onscreen. Queer parents don't get talked about much in mainstream media, beyond an occasional "look at the talking goat" sort of piece at pains to point out how normal and non-threatening some pair is, never forgetting that part of being non-threatening is never showing any anger at the forces that threaten our families. (And lookie what happens if you run one of those on Mothers' Day.)

Pratchett’s con artist works through charisma, and successfully charms the readers as well as those in Ankh-Morpork.

Add to that Pratchett’s great talent of creating stories that are really relevant, but only just relevant enough, and Going Postal packs entertainment with a punch.

Former intern: Book details Kennedy affair (CNN International)
I will say that no matter what happened last night I got a lot out of my experience, especially when it comes to practicing those self-help methods or whatever you would call them. I got a chance and succeeded in some areas and failed in others. But the more times you fail the easier it gets so bring on the opportunities life. If I want to be an expert I’ve got to do 10,000 hours of speeches to get there, according to Gladwell’s, Outliers.

I just want to keep this website active on this subject: TRAVELLING.
According to Judge Batten,
Since the FBI raid in October the fortunes of Escorts.com have steadily declined; many clients and escorts abandoned their accounts immediately and many others continued to use them, but much more warily. Before the end of last year girls started complaining about a plethora of fake reviews (obviously posted by pigs trying to establish themselves as “hobbyists”), then a couple of months after that the site deleted reviews altogether. Finally, I just heard at about 9 AM today that the site will be closing as of May 31st. My theory is that the management was forced to cooperate with the disease infesting it, but found legal loopholes so as to prevent their being used to trick their customers. First they shut down ALL reviews in order to stop fake ones, then closed entirely to prevent the placing of entrapment ads (such as you’ll see mentioned in my May 10th column). One final attempt at trickery: A notice in red on the notice page states, “You must provide us with your full name and mailing address if you want a refund check.” Please, ladies, don’t be stupid; if you provide that information your check will come with a free visit from the local constabulary, either immediately or after they use you as a Judas goat for the next few months.

Suddenly it is very important to clean the litter box or take out the trash. Or go belly rub my new pink-toed kitty who sits atop the tower while my mammoth tabby glares from the floor. Then I gaze at some forgotten linocuts. Or a book I started reading and didn’t finish. Life has been a lot of start and go and stop in the middle and I can’t figure it out. It’s a fucked up funk. That’s all. No way to work it out unless I do work. Because in the end I only have myself to contend with.

Next, we have today's Oh Susanna question!
Eventually he enters the kitchen and lifts up the envelope.
Social environment is associated with gene regulatory variation in the rhesus macaque immune system. The researchers found that markers of immunity and inflammation were highly correlated to social rank of the monkeys. (Or macaques; is it more PC to say "macaques" instead of "monkeys" now?) From the abstract:Here we addressed these questions by leveraging the power of an experimental system that consisted of 10 social groups of female macaques, in which each individual's social status (i.e., dominance rank) could be experimentally controlled. Using this paradigm, we show that dominance rank results in a widespread, yet plastic, imprint on gene regulation, such that peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression data alone predict social status with 80% accuracy.This really needs to be done on humans to see whether a simple biological marker can predict social status.

Accordingly the Jingoes had to retreat towards a "common South Africanism" of Boer and Briton, an ideology which became the central theme of Botha, Smuts and the United Party. But even so, this hegemony was always contested by Afrikaner nationalists on the Right and African nationalists on the Left. This "common (white) South Africanism" was the nearest thing to a hegemonic ideology in the 1910-1948 period but its hold was always a little tenuous, even before it was completely overthrown by Malan's Nationalists in 1948.
The actions of Newscorp, for once, go beyond political alliances. Although the vast majority of Brits still can’t get their heads round this, it is the security of the State, the openness of our democracy, and the freedom of the press that are at stake here: a freedom that will be taken away not by fascist elements in the political class directly – but in revenge thanks to the sociopathic greed of one organisation….and those who quietly joined in, but are now keeping their heads low.

Last week I read DOUBLE by Jenny Valentine. This is a suspense/thriller that uses one of my favorite themes-- pretending to be someone you're not. That initially drew me into the novel, but what kept me reading, page after page, was the writing style and viewpoint. It's lean and blunt, yet emotionally deep. I think I may just have a new favorite author here.
So left with the lack of space to place either a mechanical heave element or a antiroll bar, it appears that Mercedes have opted to create a passive hydraulic system. This is not to be confused with any form of active suspension or the cars high pressure hydraulic systems, this system will be entirely self contained to remain within the rules on suspension design. As the system reacts only to suspension loads, it is clearly legal and there is no question of interpretation in its acceptance by the FIA.

Well my boy is now officially a School child. He has been fantastic. There have been no tears or tantrums, only excitement and joy at the fact that he gets to go over and over again. I am sure that will wear off pretty soon but for the time being we are rejoicing that he is fitting in so well to the routine and loves being a school boy. He has made a friend although he forgot to on the first day and then on the second day made the friend but then couldn't remember the friends name.
Now I am not always the most decisive of people - but that is only because I can often see so many possibilities....

In between the work, we did have some time for fun – pool time, visiting the Happiest Place on Earth, and eating entirely too much. I completely disregarded my rules for travel that I laid out in March and came home feeling like a sunburned baby hippo. Luckily, my friend Kacey was able to come meet me for a (slow, painful) run on Sunday to get me out of my post-travel slump, and she mentioned that she and one of her friends are considering going on a trip together to New Orleans. Around the same time, friend Lizzie blogged about her recent trip to the Big Easy and all of a sudden I can’t think about anything else.

Side One opens with what sounds like a forgotten ident for an ITV regional station, then - POW! The horns blast into life, a guitar joins the party, and eventually after a few more horn blasts, a stylophone steps in. It's true to say I'm probably losing a few readers here, but such cynical types need to remember that there was a time in musical history when the stylophone was considered a novel enough instrument to be given pride of place on professional recordings, and not just a toy (David Bowie, we were continually reminded, used it on "Space Oddity"). The way the device is used as part of the arsenal of a lounge orchestra in this instance is peculiar and strangely likable, and the tune swings along at a merry, almost mod beat speed.

Ever since I was a teenager, I've wanted a life in California. One that didn't involve quite so many "rules" as my parents religion. I'm not really sure why I picked California in particular, other than it was way the fuck away from small-town Missouri and it had an ocean. Oh, and I wanted to be in Los Angeles, because I wanted to be in a city. (I also L.O.V.E. New York City, but it's too frickin cold for me!)
Word is that Herschell (I can call him Herschell) got the idea for Blood Feast when he was down in South Florida, thinking long and hard about what the next step in his career would be - because, let's face it, you can't make nudie cuties forever. He was staying at the Suez Hotel, where there were big plaster sphinxes out at the front entrance. Seems he was outside and, once he caught a look at one of the sphinxes in question, he and the plaster construct traded meaningful glances and (eureka, I guess) he conceptualized the basic plot for Blood Feast.

Multiculturalism has not led to the creation of some rainbow-coloured utopia in Britain. On the contrary, it has inflicted enormous damage: alienation, hypocrisy and isolation; bureaucratic and legislative creep; crime; diversity-damage; overpopulation and overcrowding; and the persecution of dissenters in ways that are all too redolent of the former Soviet Union and East Germany.
I've finally come upon a solution that's working for us. The wee ones are happy, we're getting things done, and I don't have fifty kajillion questions about what they need to do now.
