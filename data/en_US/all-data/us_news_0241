Not that I needed more evidence. In our meals, it clearly had the hallmarks of being homemade: soft, yet still toothsome; sauces clung readily to it, unlike the slick texture of dried pastas which tend to repel sauce. I'd also seen it being made in a small room off the restaurant's hallway. Two men were turning out tagliatelle, the half-inch noodles featured with a Bolognese sauce, prawns and shaved asparagus.

State and local workers in the state system — about 700,000 in all — said New Jersey’s politicians have put the $68 billion pension fund in peril by not contributing their fair share. Since 2004, the state has contributed only $2.4 billion of the nearly $12 billion required by actuarial calculations. The pension fund is underfunded by more than $34 billion. Senators point to that number as part of the reason they need to reduce benefits.

6. The mini revolt that occurs in District 11 after Rue's death never happened in the book version of "The Hunger Games." (The uprisings actually begin in "Catching Fire.") Instead, District 11 responds to Rue's death by sending a parachute with bread to Katniss -- as a thank-you or payment of a debt, Katniss isn't entirely sure.

Freedom School, to the same extent, served as a philosophical training ground for the Freedom Newspaper editorial staff, allowing the staff writers to better understand freedom philosophy. They were all working for the same goals: increasing their circulation and an expansion of freedom thinking. There were occasional departures, editorially speaking, from freedom philosophy. During the early 1960's, McDowell, the publisher of the Lima News, and some of the Freedom Newspapers in Texas were the worst offenders. Often the opposition papers were helpful in pointing out their inconsistencies (and of course they delighted in doing so). For example, in 1960 in Lima, the News was planning a special supplement in honor of the opening of a new school and National School Week. In view of Hoiles' bitter opposition to "gun run" schools, as he often termed the public schools, the opposition paper said it looked ludicrous for a Freedom paper to be issuing such a supplement and the publisher had to cancel his plans.

What if I were a tourist, without a car and staying in a downtown hotel, and I wanted to check out the Cleveland Museum of Art? The RTA website (riderta.com) informed me that the HealthLine, which links downtown with University Circle, was my best bet.

Not likely, its critics say. For one thing, mortgage rates have already dipped to record lows without reviving the housing market, reducing high unemployment or stimulating much growth. Would people and businesses that can't or won't borrow now at super-low rates start borrowing if interest rates on loans dip a bit more -- and borrow enough to rejuvenate the economy?

So, what do you think? Would you vote for an act as ridiculous as Jedward if one emerges on the American 'X Factor?' I'm not sure I would mainly because I'd never buy their album.

Regardless, I doubt I would vote for Jedward, but it's undeniable they have something that makes people want to see what they are going to do next.

During my time at the rink the best short-term burst of goaltending I covered was Brent Johnson's run of shutouts against the Chicago Blackhawks in the playoffs. The best extended run of goaltending I covered was Chris Osgood's turn in the crease for the Blues as they headed into the 2003 playoffs. Osgood, underrated throughout his career and especially then, gave the Blues the goalie they needed to plunge deep into the postseason that year. They just didn't. They had their chance and botched it on home ice. Vancouver won Game 7, and a vicious, shoulder-dislodging hit delivered by Todd Bertuzzi played no small role in tilting that series.

There are three things Arizona should do in the coming months on the immigration front to keep this momentum going. First, we should refrain from introducing new, state-level immigration bills. Second, we should follow Georgia and Alabama's leads and repeal or revise those portions of our state's immigration law that are before the courts and eliminate those issues that are damaging our state's reputation and business climate. Finally and most important, we must demand our congressional delegation lead in introducing sensible, market-based and fair immigration-reform solutions in this Congress.

A: Hey, Sartaj: It's Cleveland, so we're always talking draft. Since there is a lottery system in place, it's hard to know where the Cavaliers are picking, which makes it difficult to project whom they might select. The good news is they need help at almost every position, save for point guard, so they should get a decent player. I like Beal, too. But until the order is determined on May 30, it's difficult to speculate. Remember, the Cavs won the lottery with the Los Angeles Clippers' pick last season and it should have been the No. 8 pick.

In 1986 my son was in a terrible car accident and almost lost his life if it weren't for a priest at St. Thomas Moore's named Father Norton Herold who heard the crash gave him the last rites and called 911. He later found out my phone number and called me with the news. During my son's six month hospitalization and recuperation, Father Herold became our family's spiritual advisor.

From Shakespeare and Molière on down, Preston said, "it was always understood that the significant work in theater history emerged from people who worked together collectively over time rather than emerging from one-off relationships." But such cohesiveness is expensive and therefore uncommon on the American scene. SITI, which cobbles together about $1 million a year from performances, teaching fees and donations, helps carry its torch.

The story line becomes a romantic tug-of-war with several surprising detours on its way to an exultant finale linking 1955-style dissidents with the hipsters of today. The film isn't entirely superficial. It shows that hepcats can be co-opted, and that the upbeat "individualists" are all individual in the same way.

Pat Robertson, pro-doper? Sure, and Hunter Thompson was a televangelist.
Mourdock, a former coal-mining executive who enjoys tinkering with motorcycles and building race cars, has built a reputation as a GOP loyalist since that first run for Congress in 1988. He's a regular at party events ranging from large annual Lincoln Day dinners that are the staple of fundraising to picnics with as few as two people. He's so accustomed to delivering speeches about Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan that he seldom needs notes.
3. The Lakers were solid at point guard. There was skepticism about the Lakers backcourt entering the playoffs. Ramon Sessions hadn't played a single playoff game, showed less aggressiveness on offense and remained a liability on defense. Steve Blake was tentative in running the offense and finding his shot. And plenty, including me, wondered how the Lakers would handle speedy point guard Ty Lawson.

What if Lawrence Tynes, instead of running into history at Lambeau Field with one finger raised in victory four years ago, had to sulk back to the sideline after missing that 47-yard kick in overtime? What if he had to stand there in the cold and watch Brett Favre rally the Green Bay Packers to victory over the Giants?
Megan Bonner, 26, from Memphis, Tenn., bragged on Twitter after ordering $300 worth of Missoni dresses and cardigans until the next day when she got emails telling her that her shipments would be delayed. Nervous that she wouldn't get the items at all, she bought some of them at a nearby Target. But now she worries she won't be refunded for the other merchandise.
Schumaker lasted only two pitches into the Cardinals' 4-1 win. He later admitted to jarring the same area (right oblique) that forced him to the disabled list after suffering a strain during a March 16 exhibition against the Miami Marlins. However, he insisted that the hit wasn't debilitating and that he anticipated being available Saturday. Jay made the same claim and, according to manager Mike Matheny, could have pinch ran Friday. Having at least one of them available is vital within a series that projects to be low-scoring and subject to extra innings.
"There's definitely a certain level of prestige that goes along with having a major deal. I know several artists that prefer the prestige; I personally prefer to be able to feed my family," she continued.
It was a lockout-shortened campaign cleaved on March 15 when the Cavs, with an eye toward the future, traded guard Ramon Sessions to the Los Angeles Lakers for essentially the No. 24 pick in the upcoming NBA Draft and the right to swap first-rounders in 2013. Struggling to overcome the loss of Anderson Varejao to a season-ending wrist injury, the Cavaliers slowly transformed from a plucky playoff contender to a glorified NBA Development League team.

Personally, I'd rather look at the ocean than go into it. And, even with the presence of cars on the sand, there's no way to knock the appeal of staring out at the blue water, preferably with a drink in your hand. Although there are certainly more rustic places to do that than next to the cheesy boardwalk amusement rides next to the Main Street Pier, the ocean is still awesome.

Originally a bakery that became an Irish pub in the 1920s, The Tavern was purchased in 1972 by two lesbians who immediately installed clear floor-to-ceiling windows, a groundbreaking move for a gay bar back then. Current owners Jeff Green and George Roehm were originally bartenders but bought the place about 30 years ago. They still have the old wooden bar, keep the music at a conversational level and prohibit Wi-Fi.

Now, allow me to step back a moment. I write about food for a living, so sending me on assignment to check out the dining options at Xfinity Live! might be like sending the Phillies beat reporter off to cover a beer-league softball game. What I have to say about the food may be so obvious as to be irrelevant. So feel free to disregard me as a snob when I tell you to avoid almost all of it. Take, for instance, Broad Street Bullies Pub. This is how it was described to me by an Xfinity Live! marketing person (I’ve omitted the name to protect the innocent): “I don’t want to call it an Applebee’s or a Friday’s, but it’s going to have that sort of neighborhood feel.”

Oven logistics also is important if you're taking a dish to someone's house. Don't take something that needs a lot of oven time. The Signature green bean casserole is a pretty good substitute for the classic made with cream of mushroom soup, and it's ready to eat after five minutes in the microwave.

On Monday, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, one of the Republican signers, reiterated his opposition to filling the post. He said in a statement, "The CFPB was designed to be entirely unaccountable to the American people.

Free-speech violations are, in fact, at the center of the lawsuit filed last week by three doctors' groups and the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
You'll notice that the doctors most people see most often -- the pediatricians, family doctors and internists who handle regular checkups and most illnesses -- make the least money. But pay for so-called "primary care" doctors is rising a bit, the survey shows, as pay for some big-money specialists declines. Those radiologists and orthopedic surgeons at the top of the pay heap actually made 10 percent less in the past year; general surgeons made 12 percent less.

First of all, don't be too fixated on price. There's an acceptable price range for wines that come in a bottle, and I think the sweet spot is $8-$18. There is a tremendous inventory of choice in this range. There are many wines of true merit priced higher, but it's not often comfortable to spend that much. (That said, there is no better time than now to buy higher-end boutique wines. The economy has made them more available than in good times. Stock up.)

That may not be satisfying in the end for some. But Swinton -- Newell and Miller as well -- more than make up for that. The relationships here are toxic, harrowing and damaging. The actors -- Swinton in particular, her portrayal so brutally honest -- impart that with great skill. It's not easy to make such a downbeat movie compelling, but that's what Ramsay, with great help from her star, has done.

Led by Robinson, who perhaps was "challenged" by coach Bill Self at halftime, KU stormed to a 47-44 lead with 16:37 to go on an 13-5 run to open the second half. Robinson had seven of those points, one more than he'd scored in the entire first half.
He did it with a pair of perfect fourth-quarter drives, capping the final one with a one-yard touchdown pass to Ballard for the 24-20 victory. It was, to use the E word, an elite performance.

When a water main break in Strongsville last Wednesday caused a section of Pearl Road to collapse and become a sinkhole, the subsequent closing of Pearl Road and the interruption of water service in the city resulted in the closure of the Strongsville City Schools that day — and the cancellation of Wednesday’s scheduled baseball game between Strongsville and Mentor. When rain then postponed Thursday’s game against Willoughby South, Strongsville Coach Josh Sorge’s pitching rotation was thrown out of whack by the “off days.”

Laxdal told the Edmonton Journal that he'll try to match defensemen Keegan Lowe and Mark Pysky as much as possible against Portland forwards Sven Bartschi and Ty Rattie, who have a combined 24 goals and 30 assists in 15 playoff games. "Rattie and Bartschi are both highly-skilled," said Laxdal, who played on Portland's 1982-83 Memorial Cup team. "Bartschi will go through traffic to score a goal and I've watched some video of Rattie and he finishes his hits and seems to be getting more physical as he gets older. They remind me of Yen Yaremchuk and Randy Heath when I played in Portland -- two typical players who'll do whatever it takes to score goals in the Western Hockey League."
For decades, producers made their money on the front half of the bird but lost money on the back half, said Bill Roenigk, senior vice president and economist with the National Chicken Council. That began changing in the 1990s as the industry found new markets in Russia, Asia and Latin America. While producers still lose money on dark meat, he said, the difference isn't as great as it once was.

While tremendous progress has been made since the passage of the fair housing laws, much work still needs to be done. The good news is that blatant, open discrimination is not tolerated or condoned by most Americans. The bad news is that discrimination still exists in our society in much more subtle ways. We all have a tendency to judge people we meet based on the attitudes we have formed from our experiences and background. Together, we can rise above our human frailties; this is vital to the future of our nation and communities.
"I'm not thinking about it anymore. I think that's the biggest thing," Markakis said. "Just going out there and playing the game. Obviously I had to get comfortable. Now, I'm going to go out there and do my job and try to help the team win. It's all past me now.

Measure B would require that future members of the five-member board – whether elected or appointed – accept the county's least-generous pension formula: a payout equal to 1.62 percent of salary, multiplied by the number of years worked, payable as soon as age 65. That's a better deal for taxpayers than the current system. Supervisors, who make about $143,000 in salary, now can retire at age 55 and collect a lifetime benefit of 2.7 percent of their salary multiplied by the number of years served on the board, where there is an eight-year term limit.

As we all know, the original Rosebud was a sleigh belonging to the movie's hero — loosely based on newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst — which is consigned to the flames.

On the dry-erase board near his desk, there were hash marks under different categories: groundball outs, fly ball outs, groundball extra-base hits, fly ball extra-base hits. The totals grew throughout the spring until it was clear that extra-base hits were darn difficult to get on the ground. Outs weren't. QED. Duncan's goal was to illustrate to the pitcher how difficult it was to get hurt by staying on the ground.

Why is this so? There are many factors and usually when there is an issue with many factors it means there's a partisan divide as to its "true" solution.

The degree you are receiving this month is not the guarantee of prosperity it once was. Back in the days of "Mad Men," a diploma essentially assured you a job in a nice office and, perhaps, a nice expense account.

Perhaps the one on a recent New York Times column -- "College Graduates Taking it on the Chin" -- best underscored the point. But others have done an equally graphic job, using words such as "grim" and "bleak" and "uncertain," to describe your prospects.
