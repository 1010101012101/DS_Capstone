Actually, i never considered myself being a 'pro' movie reviewer .. but i do find myself having some professional taste in movie reviewing.. im not trying to brag here :)
For now, the CD case has been shut again, entombing those ancient relics for a little while longer. Please, don’t hate me for my musical illiteracy, my abysmal CD collection, and my negligent disregard for this amazing art form. Perhaps you can find it in your heart to at least give me points for watching American Idol last night?
TODAY’S NEWS in the Intelligencer:‘Three nights last Lord Spittal was rob’d in his coach by the Infamous Gentleman Highwayman. The highwayman, having fired a pistol shot ‘in terrorem’, and Lord Spittal, declining to give up his belongings, instead offered up his daughter. The daughter willingly accepted her surrender and according to the coach drivers seemed most excited at the prospect. The Highwayman thence proceeded to rob Lord Spittal of his belongings none the less having declared “a Gentleman who gives up his daughter so readily, instead of his riches, deserves neither the title of Gentleman, nor the riches to keep him”. Thence departed with the the young lady much to her apparent delight.’ NOTE: Despite my repeated attempts to return daughter, she instead away to Paris, being much pleas’d at her escape. NOTE: Gave her the money I took from her father to aid her journey.
In keeping with our changing values we decided not to replace those two modes of transport. Last Sunday, however, hubby and I were left at home without a car because two offspring needed them more than us. This wouldn’t have been a problem except daughter went to purchase a new laptop and realised that she didn’t quite have enough in her account to pay for it. I (mobile bank) was called to come to her urgent rescue. “But I have no car” was my exasperated response. A few texts later the problem was solved.
We want to see cards and work for Mum's! The only stipulation the challenge has is no back linking to work already posted - only new work to be linked please.
UPDATE 22 April 2012 10:33: There was a discussion at the blogshoot regarding "eat what you kill". I firmly believe that fresh is the tastiest, but there's always canned for when Unicorn isn't in season. Or for filling your prepper storage shelves. Just because there's a Zombie Apocalypse, you can still have your daily allowance of HopeNChange™!

Yet despite the risks, it is possible to take advantage of public Wi-Fi, but taking precautions to protect your data is strongly advised.
Spectacular view of the city from the top of the hill. Here, we met up with Alvaro (another friend from Louvain-la-Neuve) and watched the city switch from day to night. Spectacular.
Well a half a cider and black for me is minimum on an outing to a public house in the summer, and cokes for the kids, after we had earned it of course, we did the walk between Denford i.e. the Holly Bush public house and walked along the canal towards Cheddleton before turning 360 degrees and heading back towards the pub for a well earned beverage.
Sales threshold being the key term here if it’s not a set license period.

We parted company at the iconic Chalk Farm tube rounding its red tiles between two arterial roads between Hampstead and Swiss Cottage, one of the oldest unchanged tube stations in London.
The Opinion, which says that the UPLS is incompatible with the EU Treaty and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union means that this proposal is now consigned to history, the latest in a long line of setbacks to proposals for such a system that has been in the planning for nearly 40 years.

The resemblance to cough medicine is uncanny: I suggest the label should be changed to show a stern matronly figure holding out a spoon, with an exhortation to "drink it all up now, it's good for you."
You just can’t beat the food. The chicken, the chips, the mash, the garlic bread and of course the sauce. If I could own my own restaurant I would definitely pick to own a nandos. I would obviously make a hell of a lot of money from it with the massive que that is already building up out of the door…we clearly came at just the right time!
Over and out
I was first introduced to the idea of overnight oats through the blog world. Many bloggers (myself included) really enjoy a morning bowl of the nutritious whole grain, and it seems as though we are always coming up with a new way to prepare them. Overnight oats are simply your regular oats that you make oatmeal with soaked in twice the amount of liquid in the refrigerator overnight. That is the basic formula, but the variations on this equation are ENDLESS!
Crowd: Booo!
Requiem For A Dream is a powerful movie, exceptionally well-acted and directed, and guaranteed to stick with the viewer for a long time afterwards. If nothing else, there's Clint Mansell's Orchestral track, which is completely and utterly one of the most beautiful things ever to be set to film. Whenever anything remotely crap happens in my life, this is the song I'll be listening to.
It makes me feel queasy and stressed. Being competitive is a curse. It makes me think that I need to work harder, network more, push my blog out there so I can be *successful* too.
chose from the forest, garden, park (whatever) the most beautiful leaves (it hast to be leaf, you will see now why): with bit oil on the egg you can help the leaf to stay there; wrap the egg in the old nylon sock so, that the stitch is not on the side where your leaf is. Bend the stitch with some yarn and put the egg to be cooked. When it is over, take the stock away (and the cooked leaf) and you will see the imprint of the plant on the egg. This is how we our traditional egg coloring in Serbia is going on (since centuries). But: I suggest to take some old nylon socks for this! Those you won’t wear anymore. They take the onion color, too.
Belfast’s shipbuilding past looms large as does it’s famous child – Titanic. Visiting just a few days after the 100th anniversary of the sinking of Titanic there was an exhibition around the building of the iconic ocean liner and a very moving memorial to everyone who lost their life on the fateful day. I oddly noted there was a George Dean who lost his life (my first name is George) which brought it home to me. I thought there was a palpable sense of civic pride around Titanic – although the taxi driver dryly questioned celebrating a badly designed ship that sunk 100 years ago.

Crawling out of the tent revealed a fight between Brulee and quite a few. . . Orcs? Were those really orcs? The only light was coming from Brulee, who was fiercely attacking them. One or two lay on the ground.
There are times where you have to suspend reality quite heavily for this book to work. (I recommend you go into this with a an open mind) The reactions and actions of some of the characters are just not realistic at all. But somehow Lies Beneath gets away with it. (Probably because if you were looking for a book about reality, mermaids are about the last place you would look.)
The planned torch relay will bring the Olympic Flame within 10 miles of 95% of people in the UK. It will enable local communities to shine a light on the best their area has to offer – including celebrations of local culture, breathtaking landscapes and dynamic urban areas. I will be asking my students to come up with some ideas to show off north Devon to the rest of the world!

I love you all. You are beautiful, incredible, fantastic people who care SO FREAKING MUCH ABOUT ME THAT IT IS OVERWHELMING IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE. I appreciate your concern with all of my heart and soul. BUT I AM OKAY. I am MORE than okay, actually.
Out I fled, wild-eyed and possibly a little drunk but probably not because it was lunchtime on a Sunday.
As my blog correspondents, they were entrusted to deliver me feedback (as well as return sober) and take some usable photographs. They had to work for their junket.
Imagine if the same approach is adopted here in India. Will this re-ignite sales for the brand/business? Does that change the customer behavior in India? What will be the fate of the online shopping portals?
' I know what it's like to struggle, and if maybe I haven't struggled as much financially as some people have, I can tell you and promise you, that I've had struggles in my life,' she added.
But this is radio: And what they replaced all the description with was simply this: the song itself, rising over Jude's final words (which are, unknown to Jude, from the Wizard of Oz, and from Yeats' "Leda and the Swan", and which work fine on the radio.)

The boarding card I was given clearly stated gate D21 was our departure point, the FIDS screens that did work didn’t go that far into the evening, even though departure was by now minus 45 minutes. We were now starting that same criss-crossing trick looking for the right area to head for.
The War on Drugs has cost the U.S. tax payers $1 trillion and the percentage of people that use drugs has not decreased; all the usage statistics are virtually the same. What has increased are the number of deaths at the hands criminals and the prison population of non-violent drug users. This Nixon-era policy has failed because you cannot stop the will of the people. Again, if a significant number of people want something they will eventually get it, legal or not.

Sam's last days and hours are filled with reminders of his strong faith for the Lord and amazing love for his wife. It truly is amazing how God prepares us for what's ahead in our lives. We always say that God's timing is perfect, but when you experience something like this and hear about what lead up to Sam's final moments, you can't help but see how amazing our God is. We are so thankful for salvation and our reassurance that this life is not the end. Praise God!

There was never any attempt by KGB interviewees to conceal Rothschild's links to these scientists or that he was on a short list of ten for recruitment. They were all well aware of him, and those who had been stationed in London, such as Modin, admitted to having known him personally.

Updates are expected from many teams for this weekend, perhaps the most hotly anticipated is the Mercedes definitive 2010 bodywork. Having run 2009 Brawn wings an floor for the winter tests, internet rumours abound about what is expected. A controversial diffuser has been touted, while I have even heard noises about a switch away from the now bulbous nose. The team conducted a straight-line test at the UK Rockingham track, allegedly with the new set up fitted. Sadly no pictures merged from this test.
Krishnamurti: You say that if the minister gave up his work, his wife and children would suffer, which is real suffering for him, as well as for his wife and children. Should he give it up? Suppose that I am a minister; that I no longer believe in churches, and feel the necessity of freeing myself from them. Do I consider my wife and children? No. That decision needs great understanding.
Classic colonialism featured the acquisition by the colonial entity of the formal state power, and with it the formal and legal administrative and military obligations that belong to government. The indigenous population provides personnel, administrators, bureaucrats and soldiers under the command of the hierarchal authority of the colonizers.
The president's order allowed for the de facto declaration of martial law on the West Coast with one not-so-veiled purpose: to remove anyone of Japanese descent. It was soon after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, which killed thousands of Americans. The Japanese were called "yellow devils" on the front page of papers like The Denver Post. People clamored for them to be locked up, sent to work camps, or - in the words of one Colorado farmer - "just killed." No one distinguished between non-citizen and citizen. No one talked about constitutional rights. No one except for Ralph Carr.
June 3 - June 7 - Need coverage
The party was comprised of no more than ten people. We had a small amount of beer, but nobody had drank more than two or three and every person in the home was over 21. (Would I take the time to write a letter to the editor if I were lying?) After about 30 minutes of singing Derek Webb’s version of several classic hymns, we were surprised, nay shocked, to see police lights on the street in front of our home. We were even more surprised when the cops approached our door and informed us that the party was too loud – again, ten people singing hymns – and everyone had to leave. The highlight of the exchange came when one officer, who apparently enjoys stereotyping all college students, told my roommate, “Apparently the beer pong and shots were too much.” Which led my completely sober roommate to respond, “We weren’t playing beer pong. Or taking shots.” The cop then looked inside and noticed my graduation cake on the table and asked “What’s that table game you have going there?” My roommate responded by briefly glancing at the table, then, in a moment of complete mystification looking at the cop and saying, “That’s a cake.” Then the eight friends that weren’t residents of the home and were singing with us went out to their cars and left. At 1o o’clock. On a Friday night.

The inquiry will not go further than exposing phone hacking and lying about individual victims, it will not examine the role of these creatures in what has been done to our society. We are only able to read about it because one section of the media are enjoying undermining Rupert Murdoch, who's Fox News organisation is likely to be the only section of the US media to oppose Obama's reelection in 2012. In any event news reporting is only part of the brainwashing, and in many ways not the most insidious.

As Lee, we’re asked questions referring to events that have happened recently (not the zombie outbreak) and we’re given more or less ten seconds or so to reply to them.

The press photographers, saddled with their cameras, had a private street entrance to this small warehouse space where the haute couture runway collection that I hoped to talk my way into was soon to take place. Most of the photographers in the room crowded together near the catwalk, less than 12 feet away, where they grabbed a place to get the finished looks.
Last year Red Bull as well as other teams were suspected of having a flexible splitter. In order to run lower front ride heights to gain more front wing performance, the splitter gets in the way. Making it bend upwards, allows the crucial nose-down raked attitude required to exploit the current rules. So last year the splitter test was made more severe and also included tests to ensure the splitter couldn’t twist to avoid wear.

I would just LOVE to find out what this Inochi thing is all about. Does anyone with a stouter heart than mine know what the ever-lovin' hell this is all about? Anybody? At all? Hello? Let me know; I have to attend my anti-Inochi therapy session with that ball-peen hammer over there.
And I can't even remotely decide.
If Soulja Boy has to issue an apology to the military, he also owes one to the FBI (who, apparently, aren't offended). If Soulja Boy has to apologize, then all those yammering old bags on television who criticize the wardrobes of Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin have to apologize. I now have to apologize for calling them old bags. Discover Card has to apologize to foreign customer service representatives named Peggy. MTV has to apologize for the Jersey Shore (ok, maybe that's not such a bad idea...).

Determined to achieve slightly more today than just eating, we braved the Hanoi traffic and headed to the Women’s museum on our tandem to learn about Women and Womanly things (cupcakes/hair straightners/One Direction etc etc). Disapointingly the museum was surprisingly lacking on Autumn/Winter 2012 Fashion tips, but offered some genuinely fascinating exhibits on tribal life/beliefs and practices regarding marriage and child birth/womens role in the Vietnam war and some rather excellent cut out models of tribes women that we could put our faces in for culturally appropriate photos (see below). Given that neither of us really like museums (sorry parents) and that AB has the attention span of a goldfish with ADHD it says something for the museum that we spent an absorbing 2 hours there.
The people of Japan went through it at the end of World War II. Suddenly they were told their emperor was not a god, and that the war wasn’t actually ending in victory. Soon everything was about to change.

As if the two above scenarios aren't enough to make me tremble, I had to go and read a book that contains a story about Zell Kravinsky. This man took the majority of his $45 MILLION dollar worth (that HE earned through real estate sales) and donated them to various causes. Then he donated a kidney to A RANDOM STRANGER just because so many people are waiting for kidney transplants. His wife and kids evidently think he is a little off his rocker and I can't say I disagree with them. But the real kicker is this...this man believes so thoroughly in the fact that all people are truly of equal value that when asked by NY TIMES magazine if he would allow his child to die if it would enable a thousand children to live, he said yes.

Overall, my input is it was really time for Dayana Mendoza to get the boot for good this season. I feel that Trump gave her too many chances, playing the game in a safe way. It was an absolutely easy decision. If Trump had fired Clay or Lisa that episode, the ratings would have fallen apart, no doubt about it. So now there’s only three episodes left. Next week both teams have to create a print ad for “Chi Touch” hairdryer. This episode they will be firing not one, but, two people. I have my predictions on who will be fired, but, I don’t want to spoil this for any fan watching. Stay tuned!

Each player rolls 1d12 at the beginning of the year for each activity they are either engaged in or in charge of. If a player controls multiple characters or is also in charge of a project being performed by hirelings, the player can roll for each character in alphabetical order first, then for each project in alphabetical order. Any rolls that match one of the GM's d12 rolls means something unusual has happened that affects that activity. To improvise details of what specifically happened, the GM uses the vertical and horizontal position of the matched die to get descriptive terms. The GM can use whichever index or scale seems appropriate.
They're called "les nopos", or les nouveaux pauvres (the new poor).

Born Édith Giovanna Gassion in the Parisian suburb of Belleville in 1915, her mother was a café singer; her father a travelling acrobat. Early abandoned by her mother and with her father serving in the Army, Édith spent a large part of her childhood with her paternal grandmother, who ran a brothel in Normandy. Later, she lived with her father, leaving home for good at the age of 15 to become a street singer in Paris. In 1935, Édith was discovered by nightclub owner Louis Lepleé, who dubbed her "La Môme Piaf" thereby creating a legend. When Lepleé was murdered shortly afterward, Piaf was among the suspects. She was acquitted. In a short time, she became friends with Jean Cocteau, Maurice Chevalier and the poet Jacques Borgeat, all of whom would be influential in her career. She is credited with "discovering" Yves Montand-- his mentor and lover both.

Thus, I had to laugh at the so-called artist who told the Guardian "This is the last place where you are free to be an artist." Puh-leeze. It might be the last place in Mitte -- except it isn't. When I first came to Mitte twelve years ago, it was heaving with alternative art spaces: Die Aktionsgalerie, Berlin-Tokyo, Haus Schwarzenberg, Eimer, and others which never had a name. Of these, only Haus Schwarzenberg remains, and in very different form due to the real-estate war which they won by going legal and buying their property with funds from an angel. But, much as I hate to break the news to the guy at Tacheles, behind the locked metal gate in Haus Schwarzenberg are a couple of wings in which actual real artists who have a place in the local and international art worlds work on art. No, there's no gift-shop there. They have galleries. And much as one hates to agree with the Berlin city cultural bureaucrat who said "Tacheles used to be a very exciting place with major cultural importance, but it isn't any more," he's telling the truth. About the only real cultural value the decaying hulk has any more is that occasionally Cafe Zapata will book a good band, but, as the article points out, Cafe Zapata and Tacheles only share space; they don't talk.
So, while these kids are trying to figure out how to win this deadly game, they are being pestered by these other kids.

The fantastic victory, however, did not come without a price for the Clippers. (SF) Caron Butler apparently got his hand caught up in the jersey of the Grizzlie’s Rudy Gay. He will apparently be lost for the rest of the playoffs, as the incident lead to a broken hand for Butler. Coach Del Negro simply said the rest of the team will have to “step up.”
While I miss the pantry of my previous office and the liberty from productivity measurement (yeah!), I couldn’t help myself to crave for the free coffee during the afternoon. Nasanay kasi ako every time I feel sleepy, I walk straight to the pantry and press the button for a hot cup of coffee. Before I sip my coffee, it becomes a habit of mine to smell the aroma of my coffee (hmmm parang adik lang).

I finally got around to cracking open The Tipsy Vegan by John Schlimm. I'm not sure how I waited so long! Every recipe in this book has a dash (or a ton) of alcohol in it. Some are made with straight liquor, like vodka or rum. Others are made with the more modest cooking wines. Oh, and of course, there are recipes for actual cocktails too!
On our first evening we sampled a few of the items at the temporary kiosk in the Italian pavilion at Epcot – this is open while Tutto Italia undergoes renovation, and features some items you wouldn’t normally expect to see at a quick-service location.

The main issue that I had with this book was that a big change in the hero was required in a very short space of time. Being a novella the story was only about 15,000 words)the average Mills & Boon/Harlequin novel is between 50-60,000 words) meaning there was far less time to develop the characters and plot. Yates had a challenge in turning Taj the Sheikh from a self-obsessed, possessive character who didn’t understand the meaning of real love to someone who could care more for his wife-to-be than himself.

This brew day I decided to really get to know the ingredients I'm using. To do this they need to be handled, tasted and smelt. Tasting the malts and smelling the aroma from the hops. It really helps to get an idea of what the ingredients add and when to (or not to) use them.
The LRA also killed those they abducted who walked too slowly or tried to escape. Family members and local authorities later found bodies all along the LRA’s 105-kilometer journey through the Makombo area and the small town of Tapili.

So, I have this fetish at the moment for indoor greenery. Orchids have always been a staple, but I'm thinking a little bigger. Actually much bigger. You see, a sweet friend of mine gave me a fiddle-leaf fig, which I'd been lusting over for ages. And then I saw them everywhere. I love that they're equally at home in a relaxed beach setting or in a hip mid-century interior. Now, I know indoor plants fell out of favour, and with good reason. I blame it on an overdose of maidenhair ferns. But what do you think? Yay or nay? Here are a few examples to give you food for thought.
Your prayers and support continue to be such an overwhelming blessing to us! Much love to all.

Interestingly enough, I’ve abandoned trading the metals altogether, thanks to our good friend Dodd-Frank, which I guess was supposed to protect us from ourselves in the gold markets. Not trusing that individuals are capable of buying gold on margin, we’re no longer allowed to do so. The big banks, of course, can do it – just not us. This “reform” has the impact of doing nothing but taking options away from small investors in the name of protecting us. Yes, some people are stupid and lose their money. So, I guess we need to protect stupid people from themselves at the expense of non-stupid people. Well, at least there are other trading options… for now.

All right minded people need to work together to ensure that sexual orientation is so mundane, so boring, that people wouldn’t even think of making fun of a kid for being gay.
There is a lot of talk nowadays about being “invited to the table,” meaning being included in the conversation rather than having to wait for those at the table to discuss and decide and hand down a verdict. I know that language is useful to many people, but it reminds me of Thanksgiving dinner.
Rodents can be cute in cartoons and movies, but not so much when they find their way into your home. Your house, especially your kitchen provides all that a mouse could possibly ask for. Most experts in mice and rodent control, say the best way to keep mice out of your house is, well, to keep them out. In other words, any opening larger than, say, a pencil, should be sealed.
I’m also feeling quite accomplished lately! I have now completed my third MOD and have begun my fourth! I am maintaining my 4.0 in spite of a few challenges and set backs. In fact, I have the second highest GPA in my class at the moment….I feel really good about that. I have four more MODS to complete, then I will begin my Externship sometime in August. I am set to graduate in October, or sooner, depending on how quickly I complete my hours. I’m very excited and quite proud of my new found ability to follow through! I’m definitely determined to finish what I’ve started!

After an audition to be a part of a Next Top Model style show goes horribly awry, Shiraz tries to convince Carrie that she doesn’t need to be famous to feel beautiful and I think this is a bit of a turning point for Shiraz. We really see her grow up in The Fame Diaries and it was lovely to see her develop like this. She’s grown so much from the Shiraz we saw in the first book and even Carrie managed to grow up a little, at last.

In the same spirit as Mary Hooper, I would like to give Dickens a course of parenting classes. Although he was deeply wounded by his own experience of being sent away from his family to work in a shoe factory as a child, he packed several of his younger sons off to a boarding school in Boulogne when they were eight, not even allowing them home for Christmas. He was constantly disappointed by his children - possibly because he never really bothered to get to know them. He said himself that he had only wanted three children, and his response to having ten seems to have been to send them as far away as he could as soon as he could: one was packed off to Australia, another to India, another to China. Or on second thoughts, perhaps some instruction on contraception might be just what he always wanted!
When I saw Kristi Somers' name in the opening credits, I thought to myself: Yes! I loves me some Kristi Somers (she brought a plucky energy to Tomboy and Girls Just Want to Have Fun). However, I did not expect to see her playing a mutant frog woman. A dancer at a semi-popular Frogtown watering hole (come for dingy atmosphere, stay for the radioactive beer), Kristi's Arabella is introduced in a manner that was actually quite clever. Panning up her lithesome frame as she danced on the bar (a greener in a motorcycle helmet powers a small boombox by turning a crank), the camera tricks us into thinking we about to see an attractive woman. But instead, we're shown a mutated frog lady with killer legs. I love it when traditional titillation quickly turns to revulsion.

Until, in June 1750, a shepherd called Alexander MacPherson came to visit Donald Farquharson, the son of the man with whom Sergeant Davies had been lodging before his death. MacPherson, who was living in a shepherd’s hut or shieling up on the hills, complained that he ‘was greatly troubled by the ghost of Sergeant Davies’ who had appeared to him as a man dressed in blue and shown MacPherson where his bones lay. The ghost had also named and denounced his murderers – in fluent Gaelic, of which in life, Sergeant Davies had of course not spoken a word… But Farquharson accompanied MacPherson, and the bones were duly found in a peat-moss, about half a mile from the road the patrol had used, minus silver buckles and articles of value. The two men buried the bones on the spot where they lay, and kept quiet about it.

If my experience is anything to go by, the other big chains are a dead loss for no-budget literary fiction, but Hatchard's and some, though not all, of the Waterstone's branches are great.

“I think there is a wider dissatisfaction, that people feel partly that the parties are still quite similar and perhaps there isn’t a huge choice, and partly they feel, well, ‘I said what I wanted and I voted accordingly, but I haven’t got what I wanted or what I voted for two years ago’.”
They passed around packs of Pine cigarettes they had “liberated” during the raid and taunted each other with gay jokes. On the walls the Afghan homeowners had hung posters and odd pictures torn from magazines. An image of a yellow sports car, a photograph of Mecca, an idyllic scene of a cabin in Austria or Germany. Dreams beyond war. Beneath them, the men tipped cigarettes onto the floor and lit detonation cord on the rug, burning black coils into the fabric. A few men retold plans to kill former wives and girlfriends. Givens and one of his close friends talked of blowing up the qalat as they left, a parting thank-you to the residents of the valley.”

The girl’s father said members of the influential group are now keeping a watch on them so that they could not move or seek legal action. Wahid Mia said they executed the 101 lashes on the girl following the religious edict and they did not call Enamul during the arbitration as he belongs to another village.

Our February could basically be summed up in two words: BOOK FAIRS. It was a crazy time with 3 book fairs all needing advertising, set up, take down, close out, etc. One weekend we had 35 boxes of books delivered. That is a lot!... Like $17,000 in books. Our poor UPS guy.
"And in all of that time I won a nickname, "The Great Communicator." But I never thought it was my style or the words I used that made a difference: It was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things, and they didn't spring full bloom from my brow, they came from the heart of a great nation - from our experience, our wisdom, and our belief in principles that have guided us for two centuries.... Almost all the world's constitutions are documents in which governments tell the people what their privileges are. Our Constitution is a document in which "We the people" tell the government what it is allowed to do. "We the people" are free. This belief has been the underlying basis for everything I've tried to do these past eight years.... I hope we have once again reminded people that man is not free unless government is limited. There's a clear cause and effect here that is as neat and predictable as a law of physics: As government expands, liberty contracts.... We've got to do a better job of getting across that America is freedom - freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of enterprise. And freedom is special and rare. It's fragile; it needs protection".

I was pleasantly shocked every time someone whipped out a checkbook and wrote me a check for $100. And then we started taking credit cards and I made even more money. Not enough to live on (I had a full-time job and no interest in making jewelry for a living anyway) but the money sure kept me in more and more beads, and classes with bead artists and a trip to the Portland Bead Show.

On the Road, a movie based on the novel of the same name by Jack Kerouac, starts in a few weeks. It was one of those books that I actually remember reading. I remember how it made me feel while I was reading it. After I finished it I wanted to go on a road trip across the U.S. I made it as far as Memphis. My sojourn only lasted for the weekend. It was interesting, though. I can’t really go into all of the seedy details. Too lascivious.

Specifically, the conflict in eastern Congo – the deadliest since World War II – is fueled in significant part by a multi-million dollar trade in minerals. Armed groups generate an estimated $180 million each year by trading four main minerals: the ores that produce the metals tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold. This money enables the armed groups to purchase large numbers of weapons and continue their campaign of brutal violence against civilians, with some of the worst abuses occurring in mining areas. These materials eventually wind up in electronic devices, such as cell phones, portable music players, and computers, including those sold here in the United States. Given the lack of a transparent minerals supply chain, American consumers continue to indirectly finance armed groups that regularly commit arocities and mass rape.

The model we use currently is predominantly based on services being delivered by state owned entities and staff. New Labour's early reforming zeal attempted to introduce a more modern and competitive environment but met the same seemingly immovable forces of self interest in the form of public sector unions and others, such as the doctors' union, the BMA, who mobilised to scare the general public and the Prime Minister of the day into believing change was too risky. Old Labour fifth columnists like Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband made sure these voices were heard and moved to scupper all subsequent attempts at reform that threatened their friends and party funders and (as they saw it) loyal Labour voters in the public sector. Sadly, history may be repeating, with Cameron replacing Blair and Clegg replacing Brown. Cameron may not be worried about upsetting Labour voters in the public sector but he is worried about re-contaminating the Tory brand with the poisonous idea, no matter how untrue, that he wants to privatise the NHS.

Then Toddler came along and he was so much easier, I finally started to realize how much Preschooler wore me out. Now, Miss Ellie is cake!

So really, while we do spend a lot of time with Conrad, the film is more about the family as a whole, and as soon becomes evident, the central character is Beth, despite the fact that she spends the least time on camera.

I have planned activities (swim lessons and gymnastics) on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday mornings so we get up and get out of the house...and the kids get some exercise. Now if I could just get some exercise for myself in there, we'd really be doing great. Maybe that's what we'll do on Thursday and Friday mornings. We shall see...
This morning I forced myself out of the box.

This is a contextual snapshot of meekness. This is the attitude that we are to see as being the ‘culture of the kingdom’. This is the attitude that we are called to live out. The beatitudes are not a far off ideal; they are something that we are intended to live out day by day. They are certainly not a set of options as though we can a little bit of this and little bit of that and skip of the other altogether. When read as a whole it is obvious that they each relate to the others and all of them are insuperably linked. They could regarded as different facets of the one gem.

I have always been told that “sex sells”, and I guess it’s true, but I think that it is more the lack of sex that sells. For this assignment I chose an Abercrombie & Fitch Billboard from a few years back that I found on a “daily billboard” blog. Originally I was going to go with a provocative perfume ad that is sold at some department store like Macy’s, but after a boost I chose to focus on Abercrombie & Fitch. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I think that A&F sells sex and desire better than Victoria’s Secret (at least for my generation). I remember vividly when I first heard about the A&F Quarterly magazine. A family friends daughter, who was about 18 and very fond of A&F, was a part of their mailing list and received this “catalog” in the mail. Her mother said, as all mothers did, “They are a clothing company and they don’t have any clothes on!”. Although I may not particularly agree with the tactics of a company that advertises to pre-teens using nudity as their main selling point, you’ve gotta hand it to them- they got people talking and mothers upset. And everyone knows what happens when you tell a kid not to shop somewhere (…they do it anyway! and A&F makes millions).
I don't expect many of you to agree with me here... What do you think: Shouldn't Art be considered in the process of "forming better shopping habits, sharing with others, or making Zero Waste manageable" (as mentioned in this previous post)?

Today is one of my days at CADB, and the card I have for you was actually my daughter's idea. I threw out the question, "What should I do for this card?" She was already aware of many of the themes we have coming up, and since this is an 'anything' Christmas week she suggested an angel. What an excellent suggestion; I love angels! (I think she was looking in the mirror when she made the suggestion. She is definitely MY angel!)

I hope you will always work hard and do your best in all that you do. Dad and I love you more than we can express in words and are SO grateful that Heavenly Father chose us to be your parents! We are SO lucky and blessed! You make our home such a happy place. You make ME so much happier. I know when I am having a bad day that I can just sit and talk with you and I will feel so much better. Even though you are growing up and getting big, you will ALWAYS be my little blond haired, blue-eyed adorable boy!! I love you so very much! Happy Birthday, Parker-Pants!!

So, I jogged around a baseball field and a soccer field and some other well gated fields. And then I found it. Except, it had rained a few times during the day. And the dirt track, on top of only being 300m, now had large lengths of slippery mud.
Justin Vernon’s catharsis of a band released their second album in 2011, and the lead off single was named for my hometown. The droning keyboards matched with Vernon’s wistful falsetto create a sense of icy isolation, much like Calgary in -40C weather. Simply lovely.
I suddenly found myself thinking about this story the other day. I realised perhaps what the story is really about, from recent experiences that have given me more insight. Some events in real life have very uncanny echoes of this story and I feel as if I actually understand now what I was trying to achieve with the story. I think I misunderstood what the story is most concerned with. Maybe I wasn't ready to tell it six years ago. I feel as if I can do a better job now. So, seeing as the rain prevents me getting down to the allotment, I might revisit the story and see what happens.

Of course it didn’t turn out like that. This was the winter of 1944. Everything was beginning to fall apart. “Soon I witnessed an event that should have made the downfall of the German Reich evident – the organised chaos of defeat moving slowly, then with dispatch, and finally at breakneck speed…” But they went on fighting, even when there was no hope of victory, little even of survival. They went on fighting because there seemed to be no alternative – on what was left of the Eastern Front anyway.

There are two issues here. The first is trust and retribution. Many of the conversations I have with my client teams are around a lack of trust and autonomy. They want to respond, they know that whatever they suggest will be approved 99% and they are just as frustrated if not more than their audiences with the communication lag. The need to have the final say for many organisations who are publicly accountable is almost overwhelming. But that’s fair isn’t it? How many blog posts have you read about ‘the bloody council’? If you were to look into it how many of those would be littered with mis-information and written in haste. The public sector needs to have consistency and one rule for all. The need to ensure fairness, transparency and balance the world’s most demanding audience, the public, breeds a culture of fear of blame, which breeds bureaucracy. How accountable are the users of social media for the approach of the organisation they seek a dialogue with?
His time at Bunyodkar resembled his years at Olympiakos as he won three league titles in three years and two Uzbek Cups. In many ways it seemed a sad an undignified end to his career but that was remedied as he returned to Brazil to play for Sao Paulo for the 2011 season. He managed a whopping 46 games at 39 years of age before he was discarded by the management. Never one to quit, Rivaldo cropped up at Angolan side Kabuscorp this January in yet another ‘final’ swansong.

Hi all I really have to appologise for not posting in quite awhile. I have a few things going on at home at the moment that are finally starting to sort themselves out. Im off for the easter holidays for 2 weeks and so far i've spent nearly a week and a half in bed with the flu and now have a highly contagious viral infection so am not allowed out of house :( i'm very annoyed as I promised a friend that we would walk the 26k marathon in October and were meant to be training for it and im not even allowed outside so fingers crossed I will be better soon and can start training. I've also been doing up an order for wedding save the date cards which i'm nearly finished thankfully and will get started on the designs for the actual invites and thank you cards.
Following the straight and narrow path isn’t always easy because the straight and narrow path isn’t always clearly defined. One path can look like the right one at first but then it slowly deteriorates into a terrible situation. Like-wise, a bunch of people take the path that looks the worst on the outset but then it eventually turns to a walkway of gold.
Robert Graves is the next contributor to the collection, with The Lost Chinese, quite an amusing satire of show business and celebrity. Handsome is as Handsome Does by VS Pritchett follows, a chilling but compelling account of the mutual bonds and lonely loyalties of an unhappy marriage between 'two ugly people living in their desert island', marred for modern readers by repeated references to one character as 'The Jew', (this character is not portrayed as a villain, but the very acknowledgment of race these days is discomfiting). Pritchett's understanding of the strange, ignoble motivations of his characters is extraordinary and his descriptions are exceptionally precise.

President Obama said his formal apology to Afghan President Hamid Karzai for the burning of Korans by U.S. troops last week has “calmed things down” after the incident sparked an outbreak of violence across the country.
Comforting Skin writer and first-time feature film director Derek Franson originally began on this project back in 1994 and, after various setbacks and false starts, his surreal film is at last a reality. Recently premièred at the Vancouver Film Festival, Franson’s supernatural thriller follows Koffie (Victoria Bidewell), a lonely woman who lacks any self-confidence and who feels that she neither fits in nor stands out. One night, seemingly on a whim, she decides to have a tattoo and she becomes enchanted by it, but is then disturbed by it as the tattoo starts whispering to her (voiced by Bidewell) and moves around her body. Her relationship with her body art takes a downward spiral, affecting the few relationships she does have around her. But is the animated tattoo real or just a figment of a fracturing imagination? Canadian-born composer Alain Mayrand, whose playful orchestral score for the animated film The Legend of Silkboy (released in 2010), has written a score for chamber orchestra (strings, woodwinds and piano) that concentrates on the fragile mental state of Koffie and her ultimately destructive relationship with her tattoo. He uses atonal and somewhat dissonant techniques – and how these methods are contrasted with more melodic musical interludes – to build an aural world that’s both gloomy and claustrophobic, establishing mood rather than following any action.

It’s one thing to rely on your own strengths to succeed; believing that you already know everything is another matter entirely. Success doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and there are other people in the scene that can enrich your existing knowledge. It isn’t wrong to acknowledge that other people’s perspectives can inspire you and help come up with new ways to succeed. The first step to broadening your horizons is by simply asking other people about their own ideas. Have the initiative to ask for their input and learn what you can from them. You might be surprised by how much you’ll grow after circulating within your professional community.
For those of you who travel the Northeast Regional line, which goes through DC, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, buying the points and redeeming them for travel could save you quite a bit money. The price of a one-way ticket on the Northeast Regional varies significantly based on the distance you travel and the time of day, but as an example, a ticket from New York to Washington, DC, this coming Sunday ranges from $78 if you are willing to take an 8 AM train to $134 if you want to travel in the early afternoon. Tickets on Friday afternoon may be even more expensive.

Children are selfish, but become civilized as they grow older and take responsibility for the world around them. This is becoming adult. But the new culture prevents them from growing up and keeps them immature which is causing so much uncivilised behaviour. Bar owners and the drinks companies play on the weaker part of people’s nature rather like a sales scam would play on, say, someone’s greed. It is preying on the young’s need for fun and adventure with unhealthy adventures.
One thing to remember that is quite amazing is that all of this processing is done in just fractions of a second. Many DSLR cameras can shoot 4,5,6 or beyond 7 frames per second all without missing a beat. DSLRs keep getting faster and smarter with each new model, but that doesn’t mean every time a new model comes out your camera is obsolete.

Shifting weight also demands a shift in aero balance, for Mercedes this means more rear downforce. this cannot come purely from more rear wing angle as the drag that produces will slow straight lien speeds. So ideally greater diffuser development is needed. the team have been quick to get a passive F-duct running, this will certainly aid the ability to run more rear end downforce, but they must be careful its benefit is not eaten up by the need to run more rear wing or sales they will lose the advantage it gives other teams.

Sazed intrigues me, however I am drawn to the Soother Breeze. He’s snarky. I had to chuckle when he tries having a conversation with Vin and she ignores him completely. He says, “Ah…I’d almost forgotten what a fascinating conversationalist you are.” It isn’t just this quality that intrigues me. I can’t get a feel about where he really stands. At first, he wasn’t completely onboard with Kelsier’s plan. Is he only participating since he likes a challenge? Later on in the story, he doesn’t want to participate in Ham’s debate about whether or not they are committing evil, but he points out flaws in Ham’s argument without committing to a side. I like characters that are difficult to put my finger on. Maybe he has me under his powers so I’ll like him.

My list of things to get done is ever-growing. We will be decorating the house today, as well as picking up a Christmas tree and getting that up. That also means, in order to get the tree, that at least a part of my house has to be cleaned and furniture rearranged to fit the monster into the house. Cleaning that room will lead me to the laundry and the dishes that also need to be done which also leads me to my "clean sweep" project which stalled back in October and has my bedroom looking like a complete disaster area.

Vail visits to tell him this news. Aaron says he recalls nothing of what happened in the courtroom, having again "lost time." However, just as Vail is leaving, Aaron asks him to "tell Ms. Venable I hope her neck is okay," which is not something that Aaron should have been able to remember if he had "lost time." Vail points this out, whereupon Stampler grins slyly and reveals that he has been pretending to be insane the whole time. But he didn't make up the identity of Roy, he made up Aaron.
Despite this country's achievements since the advent of democracy in 1994, we are pursuing an unworkable political model. This model will have to be abandoned just as communism and apartheid had to be abandoned. How long this will take I do not know.

But we need to find ways of helping the process along, while also trying to minimise the fearful human and economic damage that may be done in the interim.

We started early today to make some time up from yesterday. On our way to Winchester we stopped for a few minutes in Arundel to take pictures of the castle we saw from the highway. Soon, we arrived in Winchester and immediately began to walk around the town on our way to the cathedral. The town reminded us of outdoor mall because of all the designer stores and shops. I particularly fell in love with a store called Cath Kidston, which sells a large variety of crafty, but rather expensive items. After a few hours of wandering around we jumped back into the car and drove to Salisbury.

I especially like blue hydrangeas and have been trying without luck to find a nice pastel blue bush for my garden, the problem is you really have to see them in flower to know exactly what you're getting as they're very variable. The other thing to think of when you're growing hydrangeas is the soil, acid soils help gives a blue coloured flower, while more base soils will give pink, a side dressing of Aluminium sulphate will help keep the flowers blue.
There is so much going on and I wish I could get it all out, but I am lucky for the ability to sit here now and say this much. My reality has changed so much without the pain pills and the label of "addict" feels so harsh. When I was on meth, it was different. I chose an illegal substance and I continued to abuse it. This time a Dr. prescribed me opiates and when I became dependent and wanted off, I was labeled "addict." Because of my meth addiction, I know there will always be an addict in me, but I don't think this time was the same and I think I should be respected for realizing I had a problem with the pills I was being prescribed and getting off of them. Maybe its the suboxone that says, "addict."

Oh, and just a reminder. He’s 6!

If you park your car on the street in Paris, chances are that you are going to end up with at least one (if not three or four) advertisements each day stuck under your windshield wiper. I don't know if this strategy actually results in more people signing up for yoga classes, buying oriental rugs, or getting their cars washed. I suppose it must; otherwise, why would the advertisers continue to shell out money for it?
This raises two additional points. First is how United 93 functions for the viewer. Although it may seem like a strange comparison, United 93 plays very much like a horror film. Just like a ghost story or a slasher film, United 93 puts the audience through a controlled trauma. By watching this film we are able to re-experience the fear of that moment and study both the attack and our reactions to it. And by (re)experiencing the awfulness from the safety of a theater seat, we are given an opportunity to come to grips with what happened and start to deal with it.

It’s hard to believe how much the plot has changed since I first laid eyes on it a few weeks ago. It seems there’s always new plans afoot and I’m never short of something to do. I’ve set my sights on getting a shed sometime in the next few weeks. We began digging and leveling the area where it will go as I’d been neglecting that section of the plot. I also hope to put in a compost bin, water butt and a small seating area too. There’s a good bit of planting to do soon and It’s looking like it will be another busy few weeks on plot P26; once the bad weather passes, that is. Until then, I’ll be snuggling up with cups of tea and watching the rain from the comfort of the sofa.
Another thing about these granolas is that for every bag you buy, Nature's Path will donate the equivalent in cash and organic food to the food bank, up to $1 million a year!

Most of Africa's problems cannot be solved through foreign aid. The reason for Africa's problems is the people's skill - or rather a lack thereof. That is why Colonialism was such a huge success.

Monty explains that he drove Bert home, and then brought Veda home and decided he wanted to hang out. With a 14-year-old. Nothing strange about that at all. Mildred, of course, seems to have no issue with this, or with Monty planting a kiss on her daughter’s forehead as Veda’s sent off to bed. Mildred returns to the living room after tucking in her daughter and finds Monty getting comfortable and ordering her to strip, even though she says she’s not much in the mood. She obliges him, though, and once she’s down to her slip and bra, he, uh, starts to toe her. That’s kind of gross, actually. There are some parts of my anatomy I don’t really want a toe that near. It gets Mildred all hot, though, so they start to do it right on the couch.

I want to give you all an update on my niece. She got to come home today. They can't do anymore surgeries for three months until her body heals some from her ordeal and other surgeries. She has several more to go and they won't know if she will ever walk again for about two years. They will be doing therapy on her while she's home. She will have round the clock care, as she will be in a hospital bed. Her family has their hands full and still need prayers.. They are overwhelmed with so much caring, love and support. I know with God's help she will overcome this tragedy and they will make it.. Thank you all for your wonderful prayers and caring.. Please continue to pray.. May God Bless Each One.. Susie

I'm guessing the real question should be, when will we see this on tap at EB+B? Seriously, dude, this could be a staple at any bar. If I were to have any criticisms, and this is coming about 6 months after bottling, would be to kick up the dry hopping a bit, and use something with some piny notes to accentuate the Junipers. Honestly, though, those could have been there before, and I was too dumb to crack this thing open fresh.
The year 1874 marked the millenary anniversary of the settlement in Iceland of the first Norseman, Ingólfur Arnarson. In the summer of that year there were celebrations throughout the country to commemorate this event, the chief ceremonies being held at Thingvellir, the place of assembly of the ancient Parliament of the people ("Althingi"), and in Reykjavík. It was for this occasion that the hymn was written, hence the words "Iceland's thousand years", which recur in all three verses, cf. the title of the original edition of the poem and the music (Reykjavík, 1874), which was A Hymn in Commemoration of Iceland's Thousand Years.

Likewise, PublishAmerica, AuthorHouse, Dorrance, iUniverse, Xlibris,Trafford and even Lulu are now engaging in these kinds of foolhardy promotional schemes for authors. That was very apparent at this week’s London Book Fair. At least the efforts in Boulder provider a real store committed to supporting independent authors. The shack foisted upon visitors as an excuse for ‘publisher presence’, ‘bookshop’, ‘exhibition stand’, or a heavenly oasis to discover the next great literary hope for the world resembled more like a temporary halting point on the way to purgatory. I am indebted to Emily Veinglory and POD People for directing me to this footage of video (still shot below) filmed this past Monday afternoon at the London Book Fair, but above all to Peter May who made it available.

I shall repeat it once and for all – any online encyclopaedia is to be used responsibly. However, the authors claim that it is not less reliable than other encyclopaedias, since it is dynamically created by scholars. Errors committed in articles are quickly corrected and the site grows larger and larger. It is also easily noticeable that names of well-known fathers of linguistics such as Chomsky or Yule appear frequently in the sources, alas the information does not come from nowhere.

Personally I think that lots of people see the Louis Vuitton monogrammed range almost as a stepping stone into the world of luxury bags and accessories, being as you can actually still get a good quality handbag for less than £500 and it is fine for those who can afford Chanel and Hermes to sniff at mere mortals who may be over the moon with their first LV purchase but we are all individuals and everybody has a budget of some description.

On it came - the long flat engine putting at its head with subdued snorts, and glaring out of the dark abyss behind with two great fiery eyes. 'Edgeware-road ! Edge ---- ware-road!' shout the guards, emphasizing the last syllable after the manner of railway tradition. The carriage doors are flung open, and I have no sooner popped in and seated myself than they are shut again, and the train is in motion. One last gleam of daylight enters at the window, and then we plunge into the tunnel. Not into darkness, though - there is a good steady light from the gas-burner above, which enables you to read, should you be so inclined, as easily as you could by your moderator lamp at home; or you may lean back in the well-cushioned, comfortable seat of the most roomy railway carriage in England, and, forgetting that you have twenty feet of earth above you, contemplate your opposite neighbours. Mine was a timid, pretty girl of sixteen, taking her first subterranean ride in London, under her father's care. I saw the little delicate and ungloved hand creep gradually towards his whenever the signal-whistle was louder than usual, or when the train swayed slightly to and fro at its highest speed. Papa was absorbed in the 'Times,' and I don't think paid that attention to his pretty daughter which - well, which somebody else might have bestowed in his place. Ah, fair unknown - sweet stranger, in the seal-skin jacket, mauve-ribboned bonnet, and infinitesimal boots! - who shut the carriage-window when you complained of a draught? and who opened it again the instant you hinted at a headache? Who picked up that delicate little mouchoir of yours from the carpet? Who jumped out before the train stopped (in direct opposition to the advice of the Company), in order to assist you in alighting? You will read HIS initials at the conclusion of this article; and if, perchance, you should regret that, during your transit from Paddington to Newgate, you (very properly) did not reward his attentions with a single glance, remember that the slightest acknowledgment, conveyed (with papa's permission) to C. L. E., through the Editor of 'London Society,' will be still received with the deepest gratitude.

Because of these types of diseases, we are no longer allowed such things as a bucket of water and sponge to clean cuts as infections can be spread in this manner. I know every time I walk on to the pitch, I run the risk of receiving an infection (ridiculously small risk, but still present), but I never think of it and it never really concerns me. However, I’m not so sure I can say the same thing now.

EMI were supposed to have issued the album "One Million Smiles" themselves in 1996, but following the total underperformance of the singles issued from it they immediately appeared to get cold feet. For two years after that, it apparently remained locked in the vaults where it may have remained for good had Org not stepped in to rescue the project. By the time they issued the album, however, whatever interest anyone had in Inaura had totally disappeared, and it was left to bellyflop on to record store shelves in 1998 two whole years after the last single from it had emerged. The subsequent public disinterest surely surprised nobody. If EMI's marketing muscle hadn't persuaded the world about Inaura's worth, then what was a tiny indie going to achieve years after the band had even last been in the mainstream music press?

We will then need a different kind of protection law for the children.

-Make a compromise with my vegan wishes and cheese love in becoming a vegetarian (again). I was a vegetarian through most of high school and college (roughly five years). Due to anemia I ended up adding in meats again, but I feel now I have a better grasp of vegetarian proteins. The bigger challenge of this is that I would like to attempt to switch my children to a primarily vegetarian diet. This is not to say that I will deprive them of things they need for a balanced diet. Rather, I would like to encourage more varied eating of beneficial, healthy foods. Technically I suppose we will be Octo-Lavo as I think eggs and some dairy (along with soy) are good for my kiddos. Pescatarian (fish eaters) is also an option we would consider.

I used two different collage sheets from Retro Cafe Art Gallery--the first was a skeleton from one of the Halloween images and the clock and gears were from the Stampunk Parts sheet. I did the skeleton first using gel medium and then cleaned it off--I then layered the gears on top. When both of the images were clean I used a little brown ink on it--there were a few areas that were cloudy and I didn't like how it looked, so I used the ink to disguise the white spots.

Cut in butter using pastry blender or two knives, tossing the pieces with the flour mixture to coat and separate them as you work. For biscuits with crunchy edges and a flaky, layered structure, continue to cut in the butter until the largest pieces are the size of peas and the rest resembles breadcrumbs. For classic fluffy biscuits, continue to cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Do not allow the butter to melt or form a paste with the flour.
Florence gets he equipment set up and start investigating the ghostly mystery that scared a boy to death. She does succeed in uncovering schoolboy pranks and doe manage to solve the mystery of the boy’s death but she has a sense that she is missing something and investigates further. Any more about the story would be a spoiler but I was not very satisfied with the way the film turned out in the last the third when the film springs a little twist on us. I may change my mind about this but I thought it was just not up to the standard set by the first two-thirds of the film. I’ll probably see it again because I think this film does need more than one viewing just to see if questions I have about the story are actually answered. If you like low moody ghost stories that are light in blood you may enjoy this.There is some sex and nudity both male and female so that’s either a warning or a bit of fan service.
I really like to suggest this method for anyone who never make pastry dough before because you don't have to worry about the result from working too much and the pastry will be tough cause you just shaking it, remember ^ ^.

This is a tiny little bar/pub with a huge array of beers, including many Thornbridge ales, which, as a Sheffielder, was pleasing to see. Watch out though as beer snobbery is rife here, to the point that when I complained that my wine glass smelt of antiseptic the bartender wouldn't smell it, claiming that he 'knew nothing about wine'. What-e-ver! He changed it anyway. Gav enjoyed a half of something with a stupid alcohol content and we both enjoyed sitting outside watching the buses come and go from the bus station. It was what it was, a watering hole and as I'm not a beer fanatic I didn't fully appreciate it, although I am thinking that it's probably about time I got into this real ale lark...

It was no surprise to me that Boyd got off, although I wondered how this might be at first. The interplay between Boyd and Raylan has been a key component of this show. That Ava and he do not know that Johnny was plotting against them should play nicely into next season. I would also be surprised not to see Limehouse back, given Johnny’s comments to him over the phone. Note also how Ava has stepped up as a criminal having killed at least two people across the two season’s and now taking to beating her own prostitutes when she feels they have wronged her.

Sometimes I mumble about the importance of the aesthetic in an art work, aesthetic that seems to me have been lost in the last decades. However, when I saw this photo, which won the Pulitzer Prize for photography this year, let’s just say that I got a bit over it. The aesthetic element was and will always be important from my perspective, but sometimes I just need to remind myself that the world I live in needs photographs like this, photographs to show the pain, the hurt, to show a world that most of the time we forget (and want to forget) that exists.
Trudy is trotting at Alix’s side when she and her friend Samir see a man thrown into a wintry sea the next morning. When they rescue the man, Mohammed, an illegal immigrant who has been tortured in Iraq and refused asylum in England, it is Trudy who starts to lick his face and try to bring him back to life. Trudy trots to and fro from the little hut with Alix and Samir where they hide Mohammed to save him from immediate deportation, while they decide how to get help.
I find it easy to visualize a character after I have bestowed a name on it. For every story/book I write nowadays, I spend a little name giving names which I feel will suit my characters. Once a name drops into my mind, it brings with it a tiny mental picture of the character with it. With the mental picture in place, I weave a bit of back-story and give it a personality, looks and mannerisms.

While I’m glad the girl is able to clear such putrid obstructions without my help, it’s always a little bit upsetting when something of such sheer truck stop quality comes out of your kid’s body. But hey, that’s the bittersweet reality of watching a child grow, right? Eventually the “cute-gross” gives way to “just-plain-gross”.
A mother has far greater influence on her children than anyone else, and she must realize that every word she speaks, every act, every response, her attitude, even her appearance and manner of dress affect the lives of her children and the whole family. It is while the child is in the home that he gains from his mother the attitudes, hopes, and beliefs that will determine the kind of life he will live and the contribution he will make to society.
The Norwegians of D´AccorD were so kind as to send me their 2 albums they released so far. Their first one, only bearing the band´s name, was released in 2009 and contains 5 songs that together give us almost 45 minutes of seventies symphonic rock.

Ok, so this is where vintage pack 16 should go. This is also where the "pre-finale" comes into play. The last 4 vintage cards, plus what I earlier referred to as the "bonus" card, deserve a post of their own and I'm going to make that happen for them.
Clearly Grosvenor has not been looking at two many other competitors. Quite why any author would pay any author solution company for a website facility at this price is entirely beyond me. These services are available from network providers at a fraction of this price and with user-friendly software tools. Grosvenor and their authors who have taken up this ‘offer’ should bear in mind that authors are not getting a publisher’s book page or a publisher with their own on line bookstore.
I hope you enjoy the challenge this month.
Dischord keeps their prices low, the ads are informational and hype-free. They are looking for listeners, not consumers. They run fairly in the face of what's known as the "music industry". They are not trying to outing in the music of DC-area bands. That being said, Dischord has struck worldwide cultural impact with taste-fullness, style, an recognition that is unique and envied by labels all over, and with an integrity that labels of all sizes will strategize to acquire in basements and boardrooms for years to come.
In 2005, Stanford School of Engineering started fundraising for new student-focused, technologically-advanced showcase center. In addition, they will be focusing on innovation through cross-disciplinary collaboration. In parallel, the University Librarian began a visioning process for the library. The vision for the future library included: digital focus, less space with more staff, innovation and more technology. The library is moving into the Huang Engineering Center which in addition the library will include a café, lab spaces for students, and breakout rooms with flexible furnishings. They'll be moving into this new space later this summer.
I paused beside the Rhylian, both of us staring up the length of the Citadel; the height immense as its spires rose to puncture the sky, a fortified bastion of glass and steel.

Little W tells us in a shaky voice that he had indeed been picked up and taken in for military service. After a couple of days, they must have sussed he wasn't going to be much help and brought him home. L and P tease him for crying and he denies it. I get angry and say anyone would bawl under the circumstances and he throws me a grateful glance. I can see that L and P are just trying to cover up their own fear by laughing at someone they perceive as weaker.

Yep that's right only 2 days of exercise over the past 5, and honestly they are about the only days I have exercised since the Komen 3 Day Walk a month ago. I had a nice long heart to heart with myself last night while I was wallowing in self-pity and I decided that the only way to pull myself up by the boot-straps was to start moving my body! So although it was LATE and I knew I was waking up early today I decided to do some kind of exercise - I did the Wii Fit Step Aerobics and added in some 3# dumbbells to work on some arm stuff. It felt great to move, even if it wasn't too strenuous!
Place all ingredients in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir occasionally. Adjust heat to keep at a low simmer for about 20 minutes or until cranberries have all popped and become jam-like. Try a cooled spoonful and add a bit more maple syrup or agave syrup if you want it sweeter. Refrigerate 3 hours or overnight.

I am not sure what Quetzaltenango's city planners and bigwigs were thinking in the late 1800's/early 1900's, but I do know one thing. It is obvious from the most ornate colonial buildings still standing around town that they all definitely had some type of fetish for Greek style architecture. A short walk through town takes us past the city's main buildings where the architects got freaky with columns galore.
While we were waiting for our car to be inspected, I took the girls to a play ground in a shopping center called Clarendon Common. It’s a small play ground, but my kids loved playing there. My husband joined us later which made it even more fun.

5. Dam up water flow around the tent at the campsite: Many will tell you that the best way to keep water from streaming inside the tent is to dig a trench around the tent to make a small canal. First of all, it’s almost always to buy a tent that has a Bathtub bottom. Second, there is a more effective way to keep the stream away from the bottom to waterproof a tent. Instead of digging a trench, which is much easier I must add, it is better to build an embankment of dirt as a dam instead of Building a small trench as a canal.

The new noninvasive imaging techniques that allow us to “see” how the brain operates have been a boon to the study of cognition. Through this medium, we now know that the brain is capable of “rewiring” itself. In doing so, the brain can regain some of the cognitive abilities previously diminished as a result of damage from alcohol or other diseases. The brain’s remarkable ability to recover is important for at least two reasons. First, alcohol use over a period of time, even at low levels of drinking, can produce varying degrees of cognitive damage, a problem that is of particular concern because alcohol use is so widespread. Thus, the brain’s self-repairing ability may help defer or reduce alcohol-induced cognitive problems among a large portion of the population. Second, the brain’s ability to rewire itself may have implications in terms of adolescent drinking. Recent evidence suggests that the adolescent brain, which is still forming important cellular connections, is more vulnerable than the adult brain to alcohol-induced damage. This is particularly troubling, given the problems associated with chronic binge drinking, which is all too common among young people. The brain’s ability to rewire important neurological systems might help mitigate a lifetime of cognitive difficulties resulting from chronic drinking during adolescence, but we do not yet know if this is true. Future research will help clarify this and other important questions about alcohol’s effect on cognition.

There are plenty of poets who have been retrospectively placed in their age - whether Emily Dickinson, Gerald Manley Hopkins or Edwin Morgan; the latter being revered towards the end of a long productive life in a way that simply insists in his place in the canon going back forty or more years. Other poets, one realises, may become as historically forgotten as so many then renowned, now unremarked, Victorian poets.
That's about it for now. Things will really pick up over the next few weeks as high schools start heading to the state series. College meets will pick up with the much anticipated pre-Nat's being the highlight. Here's to hoping the Chicago Marathon is another one for the ages. EDIT: Between the time I started this and the end it has been announced that Ryan Hall has withdrawn from the Chicago Marathon.
We need to reflect …. and I believe part of the reasons are because we women loves to look beautiful and unfortunately we measured beauty in terms of other people culture than our own. We lack ownership of ourselves. We mistakenly love our physical being more than our spiritual being …. we forgot that the day we die, our physical being will be food for the worms, scorpions etc.
Although this is a work of historical fiction there is a certain amount of realism. Fogelström presents a well researched book where actual events are incorporated into the book. One of the things I appreciate about this series is that the characters are never given an important part in the historical events of the time. Rather we see them through their eyes, the eyes of the normal person. That makes the books more real to me. One criticism of sorts is that the main characters are incredibly good. It can get a bit grating at times but at the same time makes an important point of not giving into your circumstances.
Voices from your past fade after a while, but just the slightest little thing can bring them back. I'm sure everyone has remnants of a long lost voice singing somewhere in their soul. I hope the voices in your head and in your past are as pleasant as mine.

For those of you who don’t know, this is the imaginary line across England that effectively splits the haves (The South) and the have-nots (The North).

But if you think Kilmer is one-dimensional and dull, wait until you see our main character Detective Black, played by Dylan Neal. He was the father of the girl in the opening, whose wife divorced him after he lost their child. I guess we’re supposed to sympathize or something, but honestly it’s not played up too much, and why would you want to anyway? The guy’s a complete tool. He’s never nice to anyone, constantly shouts and puts people down and on top of that, HE’S THE KIND OF PARENT WHO LEAVES HIS KIDS UNSUPERVISED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WOODS. Screw sympathy. This guy is the worst!

What projects are you working on now?
You know how there are some movies that are just insatiably quotable (Finding Nemo, The Hangover). For my family, one of those movies is AFV. It's ridiculously clever, and while it plays off the Addams' blissful ignorance of how strange they are, it's stood the test of time. My parents and I saw it during Thanksgiving when I was in third grade and still quote it probably every time I'm home. We know it like the back of our hand, but it never fails to entertain. I was happy that the bf found it funny and that 8-year-old me had a well-developed sense of humor at that age.
That said, generally once you're in it, the ad business is a meritocracy. The shit and charlatans get found out pretty quickly. But getting in is what I'm worried about. Specifically, ways for hard-working, committed, hungry people to get in.
So I'm walking along, and think to myself...it's okay, I can still have good luck because instead of giving myself good luck, I am being selfless, and letting someone else find it...
Aubrey has really been enjoying Mother's Day Out. Every day he runs in the room like "I'm here! Let's play!". It still amazes me that they get ten 1 1/2 year olds to lay down on a mat and sleep for an hour and a half. Aubrey is still in his crib so this was a BIG deal for him. I know he loves the activities, play time, crafts and friends there.

Take love, for instance. It can be clasped hands, eager expression with sparkling eyes, sort of “Oh, he just asked me out! I can’t wait for Saturday!”-kind of a crush. Or it can be one hand touching your chest, the other outstretched, an expression of agony and lust at the same time, “You’re tearing me to pieces but I can’t live without you”-passion. There are many different ways to express it: big, small, strong, weak, new love, old love, passionate – take your pick. As an actor, you have to be able to show the difference as well as act it. It’s not just about what you look like, but how you move, sound and behave. All of this comes together to build the perfect character.
Christopher told her eagerly about his errand.
Sam told me she is feeling sad that today is the last day she will see me. But somehow, I don’t feel that sad. Maybe its because I know I’ll definitely NOT lose contact with her. My very first friend in SMU. I’m glad to finish my last lesson with her. I know that I’m not an easy person to be with. Just my hyperactiveness could kill her already, but she’s always there for me neverthelss. That’s one thing that I appreciate and never forget.
My husband emailed me a link to this story on CNN. I don’t normally read CNN because I just don’t like CNN. When I first read the story, I felt rage. I felt my face getting red-hot. I started seeing white and could no longer read the words on the screen. How DARE they imply that being overweight means one is unhealthy! How dare they blame ME for my son’s autism! As if I don’t have enough to feel guilty about as a mother. Since CNN had clearly pissed me off, I went to MSNBC and found a video. I was just as unpleased, only now I was more sad. I had pretty much a perfect pregnancy with Quinn. Was/am I obese? Yes, I am, and was during my pregnancy. However, I did not gain one pound while pregnant with Quinn. In fact, I weighed the exact same amount the day I found out I was pregnant with Quinn and the day I delivered him. My blood pressure, pulse, cholesterol, sugar levels, liver enzymes are all perfectly normal, and were perfectly normal through my whole entire pregnancy. The day I delivered, after my water broke, they said my blood pressure went up, but heck, my water had just broken! Of course it was up! The only problem I had, was that when I first found out I was pregnant, the doctor’s found through blood work that I was hypothyroid, so they immediately put me on medication. It wasn’t bad, I only had to take a very low dose of synthroid. I also had one gall bladder type of attack right after Easter the year I was pregnant. I was about 26-27 weeks along when it happened. I was sent to the hospital with very bad pain. They did an ultrasound of my kidney, liver, gall bladder and stomach, but could not find anything wrong. After I stopped eating all pork products (a suggestion my father had given me), the pain went away. That was basically the only ‘complication’ during my pregnancy.

Though I never had the chance to test the motherboard, I hope that this little preview will give you a gist on how feature rich this ASUS ROG Z77 motherboard from ASUS, is. There’s a lot more to be covered to be honest, but these features alone, plus the build quality, sleek looks, and compact design, sure looks like a win-win scenario for any prospective buyers. Do note however that even there’s no DVI, and VGA Ports present, you can still use LUCID MVP to make full use of this Z77 motherboard’s features. It’s also not cheap, but for a premium item branded under the name of the Republic Of Gamers, the price is just right.
Most book publishing contracts can be divided into two types: fixed-term, where the grant of rights extends for a defined period of time, such as five years; and life-of-copyright, where the grant of rights extends for the full duration of copyright. (If you're unclear on the difference between rights and copyright, I've explained this in an earlier blog post.)
I have wanted to be honest and real and I (we) made the decision it was okay to share that here - with our friends, our family, with strangers we may never even meet. Based on the e-mails and Facebook messages and comments that I've received this week - it was something that maybe I was meant to do. We are not the only ones struggling. We are not the only ones who had a horrible first year. We are not the only ones who are wanting to or have wanted to give up. We are not alone.

The beer appears black in the glass, with a fluffy tan head. However, if you hold it to a light, you can see that it's a very dark amber--and quite bright, with not a hint of cloudiness. The aroma has parts chocolate and parts London pub--don't ask me what that means, I just know it when I stick my nose in a Fuller's or Young's.

“It is the business of the International Working Men's Association to combine and generalise the spontaneous movements of the working classes, but not to dictate or impose any doctrinary system whatever.

Now, Grass has received a lot of criticism for his latest poem, where he accuses Israel for being a thread against world peace, posing a threat against the Iranian people, possibly wiping out the whole population of Iran, as well as other like accusations. Needlessly to say, Israel didn’t take this light, nor did many other reactions show too much of support for Grass’ thoughts as they were expressed in the poem.

No brushes have hit my radar since I got the bum 226 repromote from MAC Me Over. Oddly, since that, I haven't felt the urge to even look at brushes. The 286 Duo Fibre Blending Brush from the 2012 MAC Naturally Collection looked cool, but I wasn't lemming. Then I read somewhere (I want to say on Twitter) that this was THE brush for Mineralize Eye Shadows. Hrm... you don't say?!

From 1846 there's a fascinating record from London's Central Criminal Court dating to the 26th October. A case of larceny was brought against one James Carbry, aged 29, who was indicted for stealing three copper bolts (value 1s), and four copper nuts (1s 3d), the goods of ship-broker William Philip Beech from Rotherhithe (who was connected with the Beatsons). Carbry had been employed on a vessel from which the items had gone missing. Evidence against him was given by Henry Peachey the foreman to Beech, and by Thomas Watkins (police constable K310) who arrested the prisoner in a marine store , having found the property tied in a handkerchief. Carbry said that he had been given the items by a man. He was found guilty and imprisoned for three months.

A week ago I went into the nursing home to see her, having known her time would soon be ending. I wore a sweatshirt, one with wings on it, (for all of those musically knowledgeable people, or anyone who sees me often enough, it was my blue Hopesfall hoodie, the one with the wings from “No Wings To Speak Of” on it.) Though she could hardly form sentences, or even keep her eyes open, one of the maybe three things she said to me was how much she loved my sweatshirt. She said those wings, “they give me hope.”

BUT when we climbed the stairs through a not-yet-bought penthouse (yea recession) to the expansive unfinished rooftop I literally gasped and practically fell to my knees. Hundreds of thousands of blinking lights, windowed desks, car taillights on third avenue and bridge pillars lay in an unending expanse right below us. This was a part of FiDi I could get behind. I swear, every day something makes me fall in love with this city again and tonight it was the idea of the fantasy that makes our city so incredibly unique. From where we sat people partied on rooftops and plugged away at work, streets were empty, others were bustling, and every single reflection had a story behind it. It's the fantasy's that make our city so appealing; the fact that a girl who started a blog to get out of a schlump can end up having you read her words, and that two people can find each other in a sea of millions.

I’d invest some money. I’ve got no idea what the hell I’d invest it in or how I’d even go about it, likely I’d hire some sort of financial advisor…or I’d do like I did when I was picking the, um, thingity-things for my 401k and I’d just pick at random. Either way, I’d try to make some of my money work for me, let’s say roughly $125,000 invested. That seems like enough to turn a serious profit (or lose my ass).

Brendan did enjoy helping me find some last minute goodies from the shops this weekend. We got 2 new books, as I have found it very hard to find any in the Library. We also bought a knight and his horse, although looking closer I think he is a king.... I am sure the children won't mind.
The “pee” is a length of what looks like fishing line. I think he’s meant to be in his pajamas with a nightcap on. Notice the absence of any external genitalia, because peeing is cute and charming, but penises are not. No one wants to see any penises on your bathroom chatchkes.

The newcomers waiting to cross the border were to be temporarily held in tents in Kusakli village on the Turkish side of the border and later transferred to one of the large refugee camps.
I've done a whole lot of healing work around this, writing, looking at it from every angle. Lots of a-ha moments and insights and change and growth. And it's culminated into this:

Even though I have lived on the Gold Coast for much of my life, I had no idea how to get there and set the GPS to guide my way. “What time will we be there,” I asked my co-pilot. “In 20 minutes,” he replied. Not being one to trust co-pilots, I disbelievingly grabbed the GPS. He was right. This piece of nirvana is essentially in my back yard.
“Being responsible for your birth means shifting from a cultural place of control, to a place of trust and inner knowing that all is well and as it should be. It is a space of acceptance for what is and then from that position of well-being, informed decisions can be made. Making decisions from a place of fear or worry isn’t ideal, but unfortunately, in our culture, fear is what fuels most decisions. It is no wonder that birth becomes something very scary for most women. ” Page 2 of Sexy Birth

But with the emergence of big, “national” brands like Solarcity, and competitors Sunpower, Sunwize, REC Solar, Akeena Solar and others, solar power has an opportunity to escape its quirky “green silo” and emerge as a more mainstream household purchase, albeit one that still costs upwards of $15,000. Many of these companies provide not only installation, but extensive customer support as well as financing.
Today, the New Forest is patchwork of hugely valuable habitats, home to a vast range of wildlife (including all six species of native reptile), and well deserving of its status as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, Ramsar site and EU Special Area of Conservation. It is also hugely popular for recreation, with many honeypot sites that attract thousands of visitors every year. But even so, as I found on this walk, get away from the main roads and the sense of isolation and wilderness is wonderful.
My little girl, McKenna (8) has got to be the easiest child in the world to deal with. She was a piece of cake to deal with from day one. She seems to be under the impression that she's much older than her 8 years though. LOL I'm constantly being asked when she can shave her legs and when she can have a cell phone. There tends to be attitude on occasion, but it usually blows over fairly quickly. She's my Kenna and my little mommy. She rides the older kids like she's their mom and tries to tell them what to do all the time.
I know that seems depressing. It happens to people all the time. I’m always impressed by people who take on physical challenges and overcome them as though it were not a handicap at all, but a great catalyst to success! (See Paul Schulte, and Stephanie Nielsen) I don’t know if I have that much strength within me to do that! I don’t want to find out either! So I live each day in grace knowing that I must do my very best and the Lord will do the rest!
I also find myself observing others more, and realizing what a long way I've come in the past 5-10 years. It's a big chunk of time to think about, but I notice how times have changed and how I've aged when observing others. I watch young high-schoolers board the bus with their nonchalant "tough" demeanor and I wonder what they'll be thinking about when they come to my age. I'm not much older than they are, but the space between the teenage and young adult years is much wider than the space between the 20s and 30s.

Now, I fell in love with this purple-ish magenta tartan purse the very first time I laid my eyes on it. However, since I've already had a similar bag in red, I resolutely turned my back on it and walked out of the store. Two weeks later I came back to the store to see that it has been marked down from the original price of about USD 60-ish down to 30 dollars. Still, I didn't budge. Another two weeks had passed before I happened to be in the store again. And lo and behold, there were only two bags left - one in this gorgeous purple-ish magenta, and another one in lovely shade of aqua blue. AND the price has been reduced further to about 10 bucks each. I grabbed both of them on the spot. It was sometime in December, and up till now, I have no regret. It was meant to be. It was serendipity!
Then I decided to plant the beans, all eight varieties. I filled a whole 4'x16' bed with beans. Most of these are dried beans, but I do have Kentucky Wonder pole and Masai bush for green beans. The Masai is an early bean and I'm hoping will fill the gap before the pole beans start to produce. Then when they are done, I want to plant the same ones again for the fall. The pole beans peter out towards fall after they have produced for months. So I'm looking for a long green bean season.

White currants, which are technically albino, are such a rare treat that I never expected to happen upon them. It's hard enough to find red currants or gooseberries, either green or red, which are in the same family of fruit. Should you see any of these lovely little berry-like baubles, grab them while you can. I can promise you will not see them again if you overlook them the first time.
First, I'd like to thank the DoubleTree hotel in Princeton, NJ for providing water glasses that almost perfectly match the taster glass on the Stone website. They obviously thought of men like me when they chose them.
So now we wait. We have been incredibly blessed by the generosity of so many people, allowing us to feel as prepared as possible for the babies' arrival. We have been reminded deeply of God's amazing provision as supplies, gear, clothing, and more have poured into our home at the hands of loving friends, family, and church congregations. We are thoroughly outfitted not only with the things that we absolutely needed, but items that we simply wanted to have as well. Local friends here in Pittsburgh have provided us with company, helped with errands, and even lent a hand with household chores. Last week, my college roommate, Joy, came in from Chicago to stay with us. Not only did she give Josh a welcome break from cooking and cleaning so that he could get some much-needed work done at the office, but she kept me company at the house, helped me run errands, and drove me to multiple doctors appointments. This week my mom is here, washing and organizing baby clothes, doing more cooking and cleaning, and helping us get some final things in order. Thank you ALL for your love and support as we make this transition. More than anything else, we appreciate all of the prayers on our behalf and on behalf of the twins. We truly look forward to telling them how incredibly loved they have been, even well before their births. This week, we would love prayers for the following:

The Tracey Fragments – Another film based on a book, both of which I have not experienced. there does not seem to be a lot of detail available about either (including reviews on Amazon) to get a clear sense of whether Tracey has BPD or not, she clearly has issues but what they are remains to be seen when I watch the film or read the book…
Tallapoosa is beautiful Country side. Reminded me a lot of My home willage in Estonia BUT WITH one big difference. Tallapoosa was very well taken care of .. well,,, I am not talking about suspicious trailers here and there, that most likely had one or two or 3 "suspicious " people cooking up some special potion .... but in general I was experiencing spring Like I have not done so past 12 years. Blooming apple, cherry and dogwood trees, Wisteria, tulips, dafodills, ... Green grass, trees getting their leaves and.... LOTS OF YELLOW POLLEN, so much pollen that one day we could see trees having pollen explosions... now, that was a site I have never seen....

In two weeks, settlement is complete and the keys land in our hot little hands. I get to paint walls, knock out walls, and plant garlic bulbs safe in the knowledge that I will get to see then sprout in Spring. I will get to sit on my back deck in the north-facing yard and tutt-tutt over the mess my chickens are making of the lawn. When I juice my fruit and vegies, the pulp will go to the worm farm. The friends that matter, will visit. I’ll find new places to go out, I’ll be ok.

“Deputy U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens is something of a 19th century-style officer in modern times, whose unconventional enforcement of justice makes him a target with criminals and a problem for his superiors in the U.S. Marshals Service. As a result of a controversial but “justified” shooting of a mob hit-man in Miami, Givens is reassigned from Florida to Lexington, Kentucky, a district that includes Harlan County, a rural mining area in the east of the state, where Raylan was born and raised.”

(I can't really stress enough nevers in this situation) do a bunch of shots of Goldschlager and try to sing karaoke on your birthday - you will be the suckiest singer there, even if you're normally soberly pretty decent and you may inadvertently grab the wheel of the sober person driving on the ride home, ending up in a ditch or possibly fall up the stairs - twice. ALSO? NEVER under any circumstance try a drink called the Three Wise Men - ever. We're talking keys locked in the car, lost earrings and people having to assist your every move only to remind you how completely stupid you were the night before when you wake up wearing someone else's pants the next morning. Wait, there's one more - if someone dares you to buy any hard liquor that is over 100 proof, just pass (unless it's a triple dog dare and you can't)...really it's not worth being told that you beat the crap out of your cousin (for being a slut), ruining her glasses or having the Southern Comfort flu until the following evening. Not that I have ever had *ahem* personal experience (there is no photographic evidence) with any of these situations but I guess this would mean you should be nice instead of naughty.

But workers don't just support retired people, they support all non-workers, including their children and their spouse or partner if they don't work. Even as the number of retirees is growing, family size is shrinking. So over those next few decades, even as the ratio of workers to retirees is expected to go down, the ratio of workers to non-workers is expected to go up. The burden on workers will be much that same, it's just that in effect, some portion of that burden will have shifted from supporting their children to supporting their parents.
I had been gripping the steering wheel because of the rain, oh it felt so good to get out of the car for a bit! I took my Bible in and was relieved to just sit and be still for a few minutes. I was reading in 1 Samuel about David and Goliath - David facing scary Goliath with trust in God!!
When using a glass cutting mat you'll find that less pressure is needed with your craft knife and so it is easier on your fingers. Also you'll find that your cutting blade will glide along without dragging or jumping as there are no indents left in the mat from previous cuts (as sometimes happens with self healing mats.)

I have been married to my assumed to be faithful husband for 5 years. Last weekend, I found an online dating profile that he had filled out. He hadn’t submitted his profile yet but half of it was filled out. In the ‘About Me’ section, he said that he was a married man looking for a discreet relationship. When I confronted him about it, he told me it wasn’t cheating because the profile was never posted. Is the intention of cheating still considered cheating?
The actual committee report reveals in full detail that Waters did not profit from or influence decisions the Treasury made to help One United Bank, or any other minority bank. But the damage has been done. Waters is now firmly imprinted in the media and public mind as the poster politician for congressional corruption. She’s black, high profile, a ranking Democrat, and outspoken. That instantly made her an inviting target to dump on the political hot seat. The release of the full report should, but won’t change that.

The main plot sees Clark’s parents (John Randolph, Diane Ladd) and Ellen’s parents Art and Frances (E.G. Marshall, Doris Roberts) coming to Clark’s house for Christmas. The move forces the Griswold children, Rusty and Audrey (played this time around by Johnny Galecki and Juliette Lewis), to move into the same room and inexplicably share a bed. Unlike the increasingly insipid Focker movies, CHRISTMAS VACATION never stops being Clark’s movie, yet all of the parents have their moments. Clark’s dad displays some of the same overly-positive traits that Clark does, but he’s also more realistic, trying to let Clark down easy that the attempt at a perfect Christmas has turned into an unmitigated disaster. Clark’s mom is this steadying influence in the background, and you can see some of the same quiet, supportive qualities in her that you see in Ellen. Ellen’s mom and dad are the much more sarcastic couple, with E.G. Marshall getting off some subtly vicious one-liners.
In later years, he has concentrated on composing classical music. He collaborated with Tom Stoppard on Every Good Boy Deserves Favour,[5] a play with substantial musical content, which was first performed in London in 1977 with Previn conducting the LSO. His first opera, A Streetcar Named Desire, premiered at the San Francisco Opera in 1998. His second opera, Brief Encounter, based on the 1945 movie of the same name, was premiered at Houston Grand Opera on May 1, 2009. His numerous other classical works include vocal, chamber, and orchestral music.

1.) As I was coming to post I noticed it was my 800th post on this blog. So crazy. I started it the day we found out I was pregnant, moving from my old blog because we didn't tell our families about the pregnancy until 13 weeks but I wanted to document everything.
Months ago, when I was having lunch with a group of French ladies I know, I asked them the significance of the date. They all hemmed and hawed, looked a bit sheepish, and mumbled something about it being an important date in French history, but just what they couldn't recall. So much for the rigorous French system of education. (Although to be fair, I don't think any of them was younger than 50 so it had probably been awhile since they had last taken a history test.)
What makes me wonder is why do we wait to fulfill all our desires and wishes before we do such things? Why can’t we do almost all of these things now, today and make our lives more meaningful and become lot happier right now? Why can’t we do these and bring ourselves this happiness and peace today?
Thank You to all those that serve.

The other day I went to the market and got one of my awesome box of veg for £1 deals. Then I went on a massive roasting spree- eggplant, peppers, onions, sage, cabbage, mushrooms, onions. I also have a little casserole pot with a lid that I got from my Nanny job (they are moving) so I layered veg in that with shepherd’s pie seasoning and baked it for some sort of pottage….and then I stir fried some stir fry mix with black bean sauce. It was an epic evening. All eaten with tahini of course.

Each case study confirms this. Storey re-inserts politics into the work of Matthew Arnold, claiming that he was hegemonic, as essentially a reformist, urging for the middle classes to step up to leadership and displace the aristocracy, rather than the more revolutionary recommendations posited by Marx. Arnold had some unpleasant things to say about the middle classes, but Storey reveals how cultural critics need to go further than the rhetoric on the surface, locating deeper veins, and even blacker track marks, on the skin of culture. His ‘symptomatic’ reading of Conrad’s Heart of Darkness shows how it attempts to construct ‘bad’ imperialisms, which are bracketed off from British forms. In this case, the ‘bad form’ is Belgian, re-situating Heart of Darkness in a nationalist discourse, even though it is identifiably anti-imperialist, thus teasing out and revealing hidden strands of hegemony. Storey returns us to the way in which cultural texts refer to grand-narrative power discourses such as imperialism at the same time as they resist them, creating ambivalences, as well as meanings, in their semi-lit, beating centres, with all of their shadows. This level of nuance in Storey’s critique is exemplary. At the end of this last chapter I sense a way in which reading Conrad like this might lead us to question more contemporary cultural documents and ask the ‘imperialism’ question of them all over again, in the manner Storey so ably demonstrates.

Being in a team is not just for our benefit. We could be able to help other people reach their full potential. We could share what we have instead of keeping it to ourselves. And that’s great because by doing that, we know that we are living for a purpose.
Okay, I understand that the police have a difficult job. They have to make spit-second, sometime life-or-death, decisions. They are tasked with protecting the communities which they serve, and preventing crime and bringing justice if a crime is committed.

Dessert was a take on a pineapple upside down cake. This was probably my #2 dish on the night, though the “cassoulet” is up there too. The cake was made with polenta, so it was much more dense, but I liked the almost-gritty, cornmeal texture. It was a nice ending to the night.
The urine is normally sterile. An infection occurs when bacteria get into the urine and begin to grow. The infection usually starts at the opening of the urethra where the urine leaves the body and moves upward into the urinary tract.

They are jumping through hoops to avoid giving us an appointment so we can ask questions about the pitch and format of the exams. God forbid that we should have the kind of advantage in terms of past papers that they enjoy when externally tested via INVLASI. We wouldn't even know the date if we hadn't called for the appointment we can't have. They said they left a message on my (defunct) mobile. Considering this is a legal requirment I have to comply with surely the ethical and professional thing to do is either speak to me in person on the phone or send a registered letter to ensure I get the information. they've never had an issue with making me spend an hour in the PO trying to pick up a registered letter from them before now. For far less pressing matters.

These statements are like the flu; infectious. Eileen Censullo, president of the Pennsylvania Society for Respiratory Care, wrote in “Reduction in mercury emissions long overdue” that "Every day, respiratory therapists see firsthand how poor air quality impacts their patients. Members of the Pennsylvania Society for Respiratory Care work directly with patients living with chronic respiratory diseases that require ongoing treatment and at times, intensive care and therapy. Pollutants like the ones emitted by coal-fired power plants (mercury, benzene, formaldehyde, acid gases and more) can make even the healthiest person ill. For respiratory patients, breathing these air toxins greatly exacerbates their disease symptoms while also increasing their need for emergency medical care…"

I love the movie The Wizard of Oz as much as anyone, but I have never liked the fact that, in the movie, the events are all just part of Dorothy’s dream. In the books, Oz is a real place, and the wizard is an actual man from Kansas who takes her home. I used to wonder why the movie felt the need to change this fairly important plot point, but then I developed a theory:

Jesus tells us in John 14 that the Holy Spirit is a comforter, a helper; someone to console us. That day when I prayed, it was His strength and His help that got me through it, not mine. This is how prayer helps us in times when we simply don’t know how to persevere. It helps because God does hear us, and the Spirit supports us.

You see, we are right, collectively. Capitalism is shit and destroying our lives and our planet.

Why are beads so satisfying? What's so fascinating about them that they've been part of human culture for so long, even to the point of acting as currency?

And then we really did get married.

Were I to be several stops away at this time of the morning, at Ikebukuro or Shinjuku, it would be a different sort of sight I would see. The umbrellas there are either black or transparent, and amalgamate into grey. A river of grey, moving in straight lines. More of a canal, whose movements have been dictated by the will of man. It does not curve. It does not waste time. Those streets, at this hour, look like they have been clicked and dragged over.
When I lived in Atlanta, there was this little Greek restaurant that my mother and a few friends would go to occasionally for an authentic Greek meal along with some wine. That’s where I first had a taste of Stifado, minus the beef tips. Tomato, Red Bell Pepper, Whole Pearl Onions, Red Wine, Garlic, and Cinnamon create a comforting, yet slightly exotic flavor and the stew is excellent when prepared in a slow cooker. So, with the arrival of cooler weather, I thought this ‘meaty’ stifado would be a great way to introduce people to seitan, if they’ve not had it before.

This meant that a receiver or a running back would always try to fake you out before moving in the direction they were actually going to go. Their hands might flail, their head might pivot, their shoulders might juke, they might step one way and cut another. But the belt buckle would never move anywhere but where the body was actually going to go.

There are free-trade, balanced budget Democrats. There are socially liberal, fiscally sound Republicans. There are people interested in the world in both parties. They are not setting the tone of debate. The recent brinksmanship over the Budget ceiling may have caused the parties to re-examine their shibboleths or face a US default on its debt, but it was a dispute between headbangers. The only hope is this dialogue filters through to the parties' activists and they re-examine their ideas, because at the moment, The USA looks a lot like a richer version of Britain in the 1970s. Ungovernable, as the tribes are just not willing to talk to each other, and I see no Thatcher on the Horizon. The Americans I know, which includes a range from London ExPats to West-coast software engineers and deep-red-state soldiers, are being failed by their political culture. Yes, a political failure worse than Europe's. At least Sarkozy and Merkel are trying to address the issues, and someone sane might replace them.
You cannot oppose mass immigration for very long before you are forced to notice the overwhelming support for it coming from some of our most powerful institutions: media, academia, business, and politics. It is more difficult to notice that Jews have a disproportionately large representation in each, and nearly impossible to discuss what that may mean, without being called an anti-semite.
The saddest thing is, I’d say 25% of Harper voters last night did so just because they are ‘sick of elections’. Meanwhile, people are dying for a chance to have a right to vote in the first place, a vote that is actually counted. These countries are shaking their heads at you, today, as am I. Harper’s refusal to cooperate with other parties has finally paid off for him; he’s manipulated you into no longer giving a damn who runs things, as long as no one troubles you with the details.

So Monday comes and we park get the boom box out and set up camp adjacent to the MLK Memorial, and wait for the people. Mobbers were supposed to wear red, black, green, or gold. All leaders were ready and waiting by 1:30pm. Some people were confused about where we were meeting. The Dream LLC didn’t want to do it right at the site, we were not going to get crunk right under The Monument. So we did a couple of sweeps to get all over to the right spot.

Be unselfish. Ask God to help you think of yourself less and other people more. Personally develop a habit of generously giving your money, time, and talents to help others, both on and off the job. Help your organization help others, as well, such as by giving a percentage of its profits to people in need and mentoring future leaders within your organization. Make decisions through a Socratic method, which involves asking people questions, facilitating team discussions with talented people and making decisions based on those discussions, and summarizing decisions and directions to your team to clarify and build unity.

Connecting all the dots points to this portrait being of Charles Genevieve Louis Auguste André Timothée D’Eon de Beaumont, aka the Chevalier D’Eon, a biological male who spent his first 49 years dressed as a man, fighting in the Seven Years’ War, fomenting political intrigue as part of Le Secret du Roi, King Louis XV’s personal secret spy network, and serving as Minister Plenipotentiary in London in 1763....
Parents can bless their child in no greater way than to pray for his or her salvation. Yet sometimes knowing what to pray can be difficult. Prayers for Prodigals will help you pray for your prodigal child while encouraging you and reminding you of the power of God to answer prayer. Ninety Scripture-based prayers cover emotional and practical challenges faced by parents of prodigals.

India prides itself as being the largest democracy in the world. It's economy is growing with an emerging middle class. It may not be a super power (yet?) but it is a regional power and India is better placed than any other nation to accommodate Sri Lankan Tamils fleeing alleged persecution in Sri Lanka. So why are there more Sri Lankan Tamils in Canada than in India?

I guess I'd better get busy and get my tree decorated as it's only 7 days until Christmas. It's standing in the living room completely undecorated. I had a bazillion things to do today before we could go to my significant other's great niece's 2nd birthday party. And somehow the tree decorating didn't happen. I need to find one of those light connector things that you can feed through the tree to connect all of your lights to because our other one was broken when we got it out to use it. We've had it so long that I don't even know if they make them any longer. I'll look for it after work tomorrow. Then I can get the tree decorated. I guess that means I can leave it up longer after the holidays 'cause it's taken me so long to get it decorated. Works for me. All the other decorations are finally finished. Finally...
A few days AFTER Christmas, Jeremy's mom and her husband came down for a visit and to celebrate Christmas with us.

In talking with friends recently, I get the feeling that I may be the only 30-something out there that still does New Years resolutions. Really? Anybody else out there?

While many conventional economist, points to over consumption and over leveraged, particularly in the real estate sector, as the cause of the Hamburger Crisis, a string of cutting edge economist have argued otherwise, that the “Real Fault Line” in the American economy, causing the Hamburger Crisis, is the wide gap between the rich and poor.

However, as I understand it, Harold Camping no longer has this perspective himself. He used to believe and teach that the folks left behind after the Rapture would then suffer horribly for five months and die … and go to eternal torment in Hell. As one commentator put it, Camping was “one of the most ardent hell and damnation emphasizers of any evangelist in recent memory.”

Regarding the story, it’s very far in comparison to other Filipino horror movies which are solely based on superstitious beliefs. It focuses more on its social relevance, the essence of family, and why some people cannot dodge karma. It digs deeper to the root of the grudges that transcends to different psycho-thrilling acts. You will get your brains out figuring out what’s happening especially when what someone is thinking is being projected while in total disagreement of the real situation.

It read like a chapter out of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, instead this time, the evil protagonists were not Jews (for the most part) but rather rightwing anti-fag/ zealots whose secret(?) Facebook group was infiltrated by undercover maggots who then spread the LIES to HATERS/fag activists who then trumpeted the news across the airways and throughout cyberspace. In reality, the sensationalistic reports were totally false and what was true is hardly sensational.
It helped that it's been over two years since I read The Thief Lord, so I had few instances of "that wasn't in the book" or "how could they have left out such and such."
when you try your best but you don’t succeed, when you get what you want but not what you need; when you feel so tired but you can’t sleep … stuck in reverse. when you love someone but it goes to waste, could it be worse? when you’re too in love to let it go — but if you never try you’ll never know just what you’re worth. lights will guide you home and ignite your bones … and i will try to fix you.

What the problem is precisely is that the nation of North Korean will continue to try, simply because it can, due to a lack of any ability to bring it under control by those that value life, and non-irradiated fish. They do not fear the U.S., or any other military power – of course, China, lent a helping hand in getting the right materials to the North Korean’s – or at least one of their companies did, and one knows, communist countries, own everything, there are no private corporations in China (CanIndia.com) (well, with the exception of General Motors and G.E.).
“Let me be very clear…Christians can and should have political opinions! (Have you ever noticed that those who criticize Christians for having a political opinion always seem to have their own political opinion?) We should vote (and if you don’t then keep your mouth shut when it comes to our country and how it is led!) We should pray for our leaders as the Scriptures clearly teach.

And there is another issue about buying digital goods. Some companies charge extra if you use their content on a smartphone. Rdio and Spotify are $4.99 a month for listening on your computer but $9.99 a month to also listen on your smartphone.

Why would they care where you read their paper.

One marketing tool I believe is very effective is to post on other people’s blogs. People read their own blog. I think building community is more important than direct marketing. Making connections with the movers and shakers in the business is also important. That’s the reason I was just at RT and will be attending Thrillerfest in July.

I hoped you guys enjoyed it, this was a lot of work and this will be the last blog I'll be doing from my house, because this Friday, I'm moving in to the Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

So any well wishes or best of luck comments would be appreciated.
In the Wassalou region of Southern Mali is situated the small farming village of Korin. For many generations the people of this land locked region of West Africa have raised cattle and worked the soil. The constant cycles of drought have made their lives susceptible to famine, and food is never far from their thoughts. Issa Bagayogo was born in 1961 to a father that had four wives, and eventually was surrounded by fourteen brothers and sisters. All of the children at a young age were expected to work in the fields; it was the only way to stay alive. As a teenager Issa started to learn how to play the kamele n’goni, a traditional Malian six stringed instrument similar to a guitar. He was slowly getting a local reputation as a singer and performer when at the age of thirty Issa felt he had finally paid his family dues of working the land and headed for Mali’s capital city Bamako. He needed more out of life than the endless plowing of fields; it was time to try surviving as a musician.
So as we cut up the fallen tree to get it out of the yard and adjoining driveway, I took the opportunity to use the natural greens in an indoor impromptu arrangement in our foyer. There was no art involved, I just cut up a bunch of branches and put them in an urn. Matched up with a wintry pinecone wreath and some birch-bark candles, it makes a simple vignette on our foyer table.

Before the fall of the Soviet Union the Marxist cause had made huge advances. Nobody living in the 1950's or 1960's would have been accused of being a conspiracy theorist had they claimed that there were people within our society working for its destruction, because there were. Communism made no secret of its sworn aim to dominate the world and, unlike with Islam today, there were no politically correct scruples against acknowledging it.

Within this body of entrapped Tamils, therefore, the circumstances were revolutionary in impact, though this turn of mind does not seem to have embraced the diehard supporters in their midst.[xx] Thus, the evidence provided by reporters behind army lines as well as the recent UTHR report confirm the conclusions one could draw from the many efforts by those entrapped to flee LTTE containment – even in the face of fire and death from Tiger interventions.

Azuma tweaks this model for understanding symbols and narrative in his database model. While Ōtsuka argues that the grand narratives of shows like Evangelion are given weight by their relevance to real-world grand narratives (such as nation and history), Azuma believes otaku narratives are almost completely removed from those of the real world. In the opening chapter of Otaku, he states, “In otaku culture ruled by narrative consumption, products have no independent value; they are judged by the quality of the database in the background.” Thus, although an otaku might be familiar with Ayanami Rei’s age and bust size, be able to quote her dialog, and expound on the quality of various plastic models made in her likeness, he is not invested any larger worldview or grand narratives that may be encompassed by Neon Genesis Evangelion. Instead, the otaku mines the series for information to plug into a mental database that also contains information on similar shows. Because of the absence of the emotional pull of grand narratives, the otaku can substitute one element of his database for another. The light blue hair of a young female character such as Hoshino Ruri from Martian Successor Nadesico or Tsukishima Ruriko from Droplet effectively is the light blue hair of Ayanami Rei. For otaku, grand narratives are nothing compared to the “animalistic” appeal of a character’s cute face or slender waist. Tropes can therefore be transferred from one story and character to another, as can an otaku’s emotional investment.

The whole situation kept me away from my blogs for very long. Too long maybe. And then one day I started to pray, not that I did not pray before but this time it was different, I started to have long conversation with my God and ask him to give me more strength and faith and courage and suddenly my life started to get better (not that the situation in Haiti is better) but my personal life gets richier and I have learned to cop with the environment - not as I would want it but as it is when there is no other choice.
All this being said, I think it is getting high time for Paul and I to get away for a weekend. Not because I am sick of the kids, because I am not. But because we need some time to talk and to connect and to just have fun being a couple, not just Mom and Dad.
