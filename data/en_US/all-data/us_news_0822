The kitchen's palette and whitewashed brick continue into the adjacent family room, also designed by Schlarb. The geometric theme carries over, too, in a copper mirror above the fireplace and a rug made of gray cowhide shapes stitched together. Upholstered and textured items - a sofa, armchairs and fur-topped stools - offset the sharp angles.
The department said it reviews the criminal records only of those who check the box admitting to past crimes, or when the department receives information suggesting someone has a criminal history. Criminals who lie don't get a background check.
It's a strange phobia, considering that "Brokeback Mountain" may be the best date movie to come along in years. You have the potential to look so sensitive that you can probably get her to pay for the movie and a trip to Red Lobster. Add a few tears near the ending (just think about that scene in "Rudy" where underdog Rudy leads the Notre Dame Irish on the field), and you might be surprised where the evening takes you. Think make-up sex is great? Try some you-just-took-me-to-"Brokeback Mountain" sex.
Christine Brooks, a friend of seven years who served as officiant at the couple's wedding at Quail Hollow Ranch, said Collins was "the most honest person I've ever known in my entire life." The couple marked their fourth anniversary on May 3.

In a move that acknowledges the higher risks that kids face from medical imaging tests, the Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday will announce a proposal to protect children from unnecessary radiation exposure.
John Czarnecki, FoxSports.com: "Michael Brockers is the best run-stuffing defensive tackle in the draft and would have been a top 10 pick next season at he stayed at LSU. He's basically a third-year sophomore. Brockers is a solid young man (6-5, 320 pounds) with a bright future if he remains grounded. He was an extremely hard worker for the Tigers and never disappeared in the big games. With three quality defensive ends, led by Chris Long, the Rams needed a defensive tackle to hold down the middle. When everybody thought the Rams were going to end up with Justin Blackmon in order to help Sam Bradford, Brockers may be disappointing to the fans but it makes sense to coach Jeff Fisher. The Rams need so much talent and they are stockpiling picks, adding the Cowboys 45th pick. This draft is extremely deep between Nos. 20 to Nos. 55 and the Rams will be making three more selections in that range, so they should be getting some quality talent tomorrow."

Season highlights: "Last season I was a first-team all-state outfielder and this season first-team all-conference. I led the team in batting average in conference, and tied a school record in runs batted in (RBI) with 33, was a part of the first conference championship in six years for Wilsonville High School, had two RBIs and a run scored in our semifinal game against No. 1-ranked Pendleton, and was a part of the first state championship game in school history. We lost to Sherwood High in the championship game."
The difference is that Sowell, who faces the death penalty if convicted of murdering 11 women, is truly indigent -- a fact that doesn't please citizens who will subsidize what's likely to become the most expensive publicly funded criminal defense in Cuyahoga County history. That's because justice, particularly in a case where a man's life is at stake, demands a thorough and vigorous defense. Poverty should not be a bar to an effective defense, no matter how heinous the crimes.
What: This egalitarian retrospective devotes an entire CD to each member of the classic Kiss lineup. The Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley discs are stacked with hard-rocking keepers -- from "Rock and Roll All Nite" to "Detroit Rock City" -- although once you get past "New York Groove" and "Beth," the pickings are slimmer on the Ace Frehley and Peter Criss volumes.
She said the transactions save the prisons about 6 percent in operational costs. Plus, the state thinks it will trim about $7 million by combining the two Grafton prisons in Lorain County. But the state still has outstanding bonds to pay off that were used to help fund construction of the Lake Erie prison in 2000.

CINCINNATI - After nine years, three months and almost 157 games as the franchise that could not, the Houston Texans were two minutes, 33 seconds, 80 yards and seven points from becoming the franchise that could.
That spurt seemed to finally wake up the Bulls defense, which was its usual smothering self. The 76ers scored just 12 points in the opening eight minutes of the quarter. The lull allowed the Bulls to pull even, and eventually take the lead, with 30 seconds left in the half before Spencer Hawes hit a 3-pointer to give Philly a two-point halftime lead.
GM's Lordstown plant probably won't produce more vehicles because it at full capacity with 4,500 workers filling three daily shifts. The plant produced about 22,000 cars in both January and February. But GM could earn more for each vehicle sold if it is able to get rid of incentives.

Instead, they feel Roy’s swelling and pain is merely a re-occurrence of symptoms Roy feels every season. The hope is that Roy’s knee will recover as in previous seasons.
Sliver is the perfect conduit for the chiaroscuro material, never going for a cheap mug or sentimental tear. Her final monologue, when she allows that her decline might be more serious then she has been willing to admit, is a throat-gripper -- frightened and angry, raw and real. Those with aging parents in the audience will recognize the emotions only too well, but in Silver's hands, its precise articulation is a breathtaking experience.
Every muscle strained and her face turned a bright red. But she did it. The record was hers.
Instead of joining a team that would have given him a better chance to start — or re-signing with the Chiefs and competing with Matt Cassel for the starting job — Orton elected to join the Cowboys, giving them insurance in case Romo is injured.

Bea's house, where her husband convalesced the last few years of his life before dying a few months before her, was full of books about gardening. Her friends were gardeners too.
-- When Coughlin says it's about more than just the offensive line struggling to make blocks in the running game, he means it. One play I noticed live Monday night was in the second quarter when Cruz was unable to stop S Roman Harper from spinning off him on a pitch play that seemed to be otherwise blocked well. It went for only 1 yard on a first-and-15. After an incompletion and a 6-yard screen pass (on which LB Scott Shanle got around Boothe to stop RB D.J. Ware), the Giants settled for a field goal in a game that required touchdowns.
At first, the agreement, dubbed the "Adoption Pact," was a success. By 1999, the number of homeless dogs and cats killed in the city's shelters was cut to 2,916, including some pets who were too ill to be treated. It was the best save rate of any city in the country at the time.
Assemblyman Jay Webber (R-Morris) made a procedural move to try to get the bill that devotes the revenue to rebates and prescription drugs thrown out by arguing it was outside the rules of the General Assembly.

"I think that despite the continued rhetoric about the end of pay-to-play, we are clearly seeing that organizations benefiting from municipal contracts are paying to play," said Brigid Harrison, a professor of political science at Montclair State University and an expert in campaign finance.
* This isn't a problem, two have two elite goaltenders. The problem is going into the postseason with a No. 1 goalie that isn't a No. 1 goalie. A No. 1 goaltender that inspires little confidence, a No. 1 goaltender that has the job because the team couldn't find anyone better, a No. 1 goaltender that's just waiting to get blown up. Having two highly capable goaltenders going into the postseason. The problem is not having one highly capable goaltender to take into the postseason.

"At the end of the day, I'm going to take it as a positive. I was 16 of 20 on first-pitch strikes, so obviously I'm throwing the ball in the zone. It wasn't like I was up there ball four, ball eight. Obviously, not the results I wanted, but I'll be fine. I'll be good for the next start."
There's even a helpful notice posted at the bottom of the Snow ramp pointing people toward the lot, as a pair of Road Rant scouts -- including Lisa Riley of Avon -- reported in recent e-mails. "It would be much less confusing" if signs on Ohio 237 told people to exit at Snow, Riley wrote.

The NCAA Preliminary Round regional qualifying meets are a case in point. There are no team scores and no winners. The best athletes frequently deliver throttled down performances because they are trying to qualify with minimum efforts to save themselves for the NCAA Championships. It's long, torturous to watch and virtually guaranteed to drive spectators away.
"In addition, the likelihood of dry mouth increases with the number of medications a person takes. Since people over 65 use an average of three prescriptions and two over-the-counter medications per day, they stand a good chance of suffering dry mouth. Denture wearers with reduced salivary flow should be particularly concerned about the cleanliness of their dentures and serious health risks associated with contaminated dentures."
Many people got up to leave during a four-song interlude with her side project, The Pistol Annies. The trio, with its more traditional stripped-down, Hillbilly roots sound, failed to enthrall many in the crowd, particularly after being in near 100-degree heat and drinking for much of the day.

Bank of America Corp. gained 4.7 percent, the most of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones industrial average, after chief executive Brian Moynihan told an investor's meeting that the bank could earn more money over the next two years as its business stabilizes.

Those artists include Nine Inch Nails, Maroon 5, My Morning Jacket, Ben Harper, Steve Earle, Kanye West, Conor Oberst, Rise Against, Serj Tankian of System of a Down, Joe Satriani, Sonic Youth, filmmaker Michael Moore and comedian Chris Rock.
This one-war response capability needs to be responsive and highly effective to compensate for its modest size. That fact has implications in areas like strategic transport. It also has implications for the National Guard and Reserves. They remain indispensable parts of the total force. They have done well in Iraq and Afghanistan and merit substantial support in the years ahead — better than they have often received. But they are not able to carry out prompt deployments to crises or conflicts the way that current American security commitments and current deterrence strategy require. As such, we should not move to a "citizens' army" that depends primarily on Reservists for the nation's defense.
The ruling also states: " ... the prosecutor’s frequent comments that defendant was ‘a liar’ should not be repeated."
The district may be California's quirkiest. It contains uber-wealthy Marin County, thousands of acres of prime vineyards, miles of depleted salmon rivers, and the dirt-poor backcountry in the far north. Its biggest cash crop is marijuana, and there are more American Indian tribes than anywhere else in the state.
Perhaps that’s because Ellroy gets story and co-screenplay credit on this one; perhaps it’s because director Oren Moverman – a former Israeli soldier – understands all that macho can mean.

Friar set a new school record, something she's done many times over in multiple events.
The same cannot be said of Eliot. She never intended to flout convention, and her "Middlemarch," published in installments in 1871 and 1872, is widely considered the apogee of the British novel. I first read it in college, captivated by its protagonist, the young gentlewoman Dorothea Brooke, who makes many mistakes while earnestly trying to find the right way to live.

Regardless of its dramatic increase in obesity over the past two decades, Hamburg said Oregon is in relatively good shape compared to other states such as Mississippi, who has the highest obesity ranking.
Diagnosing ADHD is far from an exact science. Children with extreme symptoms are fairly straightforward to identify, but most fall somewhere in the middle, making the diagnosis fuzzier and prone to error. Evaluations often consist of subjective questionnaires for parents and teachers that have yes-or-no answers — if enough of the answers are yes, the child may be diagnosed with ADHD, says Dr. Lawrence H. Diller, a behavioral and developmental pediatrician in Walnut Creek, Calif.
Education policy, especially concerning rules for charter schools and how teachers are paid, were key areas where majority-party Republican lawmakers in the House and Senate were at odds.
The combination of limp hiring by businesses and more governments layoffs expected means unemployment could rise to 10 percent again this year or next. When Obama took office in January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.7 percent.
The wash trading left the bank with no net position in the market but with a profit from saving in Canadian taxes, the CFTC said. The agency said the trading is illegal because they weren't arms-length transactions that involved profit and loss.

Foglia claimed he went to Lott's home to make peace with her, but she provoked him by coming at him with a small wooden folding tray table. In a rage, he grabbed the table and hit Lott on the head. His attorney characterized it as a crime of passion, not premeditated murder.
"I think it's fair to say that Ohio has one of the more restrictive statutes as far as the requirements go that are in there," said National Rifle Association lobbyist John Hohenwarter. "The majority of the states, for example, do not address consumption of alcohol by the gun owner."
The candidates are relying on attack ads to sway or motivate voters. TV and Internet ads for Barrett and Falk accuse the governor of cutting funding for education and failing to create the 250,000 jobs he promised in the 2010 campaign. Ads on behalf of Walker portray Barrett as the mayor of a failing city with a poor economy and Falk as a poor fiscal manager.

I confess to my own inner Neanderthal whenever I get near a football field. I love the collisions. I feed off of the sound of all that football armor pounding into a loud and continuous thunder. I am one of those folks who's fascinated with the way NFL Films can turn all those ferocious, bone- and tendon-damaging collisions into slow-motion football poetry. I am the same guy who sneered at the shocked reactions of some football fans who were appalled at the blood-thirsty language and cold-blooded attitudes revealed in Bountygate. But I am also the same guy who thinks the NFL has for too long treated player safety as an emotionless liability issue instead of a more human health issue.

Richardson has been in Phoenix nearly two years, evolving from an awkward transition upon his arrival as a third or fourth option to a more familiar role as a primary scorer. He is the Suns' top returning scorer from last postseason, including 28 points per game in four first-round victories against Portland. Richardson averaged more points in his six previous seasons but Suns coach Alvin Gentry still considered last season the best work of Richardson's career because of his all-around progress.

Vanderbeek declined to discuss the matter today. But after a reporter asked whether any elected officials had sought Springsteen tickets for the May 2 concert, arena officials immediately offered a copy of a March 22 private e-mail request from the mayor’s campaign staff for tickets — a communication that ordinarily would have likely been kept confidential.

There used to be two kinds of people in retirement -- those who stayed home and those who didn't. Now, there's a third category: nomads who relocate when they retire, then pick up stakes a few years later and move again.

Honestly. It's a small exaggeration to say that I could board a flight to China tomorrow, be in Shenzhen by the next morning, plunk down about 1800 Yuan for a working Tegra 2-based 10.1-inch Android slate, draw my own logo on it with a white Sharpie on the flight home, and then after a quick 15-minute press conference at the airport Ramada I'd be just as credible a force in Android 3.0 tablets as most of the companies who showed off hardware at CES this year.

Working parents do not need to call to make an appointment, leave work to go to that appointment or fill out pages of an application.
The Ducks overcame adversity. They won with backups of backups playing at key positions. They won with ASU's offense putting a ridiculous amount of pressure on the defense. They won in spite of turnovers, and having to come from behind, and with rain falling and every excuse to quit.
There were moments of the "old" Brandon Roy, effective off the dribble, in traffic, at the free throw line. Roy was one of three Blazers starters to score at least 20 points, along with LaMarcus Aldridge (20) and Wesley Matthews (24).
But Marquette skated into the game Wednesday looking for a win rather than an excuse. The Mustangs got off to a fast start and skated to a 5-1 victory against Holt.
Yet even this comes with a mythic underpinning, a touch of the mysteries. Graciela is obsessed with Jackie Kennedy and presses against the security fence to get close to her. As she does, she scrapes her wrist and starts to bleed. She and the first lady make eye contact and something passes between them, a transference that activates her state of grace.

The day the music died -- Feb. 3, 1959 -- Buddy Holly was just 22 years old, yet this kid from Lubbock, Texas, managed to become one of rock 'n' roll's greatest legends. To celebrate what would have been Holly's 75th birthday tomorrow, an all-star lineup takes on 16 of his hits. Aside from Linda Ronstadt's boisterous 1976 cover of "That'll Be the Day," all are newly recorded. Other veteran artists include Ringo Starr ("Think It Over"), Brian Wilson ("Listen to Me") and Stevie Nicks (with a country-tinged "Not Fade Away"). The vets are set side by side with fresh faces such as the Fray, Cobra Starship, Imelda May and Zooey Deschanel. While most of the artists offer fine, true-to-the-original versions, Cobra Starship's "Peggy Sue" gets a nice change-up with a he said/she said duet, May is resourceful with a rockabilly edge on "I'm Lookin' for Someone To Love" and Deschanel's rendition of "It's So Easy" has built-in sexiness missing from the original. It's so easy to like this album.
Cannon and Coffield, who both worked on the new criteria, emphasize that the changes were not intended to cater to anyone. The new pay figures are "on the low side," and many theaters are already in compliance, Cannon said.

In the filing, Zimmerman, 28, also waives his right to answer to the murder charge in person. It is not clear what that means for Zimmerman's arraignment date, scheduled for May.

Former county auditor Frank Russo, who's pleaded guilty to taking bribes and faces more than 20 years in prison, will definitely not win the contest, either. Russo's made a career of taking advantage of connections and is still doing it. This time, he's using the feds. As their star witness on all things corrupt, he gets to stay out of prison until he's done testifying against Dimora and others. At the current pace, Russo won't see the inside of a cell until the next century.

Staton: "All of them that you've mentioned. New leads help us build off of old leads. If we've got a lead that we're working on — and this applies to any case — you've got a lead that you're working on and you haven't closed that lead out and there's another piece of information that comes in from another source that will add to that, it helps expand on that. And potentially that lead will take us somewhere. That's what we're looking for and that's one of the reasons why I'm talking with you. Keeping this out there — people think of things. And we do take suggestions — please, you communicate this to your readers. We take these suggestions that come in. It may not be a lead where you're pointing at an individual or a location or anything like that, but taking a suggestion."
Batchelder's staff also expressed some confusion over the two bills. Earlier Thursday, the Speaker's office said in-person absentee voting would be permitted the weekend before the election. But the Speaker's office reversed course after a second read of the two bills and discussing the matter with Husted's office, Dittoe said.
Thus does a rationale attach to an otherwise illogical relocation. South Eighth just north of Washington Avenue is not exactly the French Quarter. A shuttered Italian candy-and-cigarettes corner store, the color of tobacco stain, lies to the north; a series of funky Vietnamese shops and eateries spill to the south, offering cilantro-scented "hoagies" and fatty roast pork hacked from hanging carcasses. (Calmels prides himself in using all the parts of whole animals, from fish to rabbit to pig. But you can stand at the door of the Vietnamese places, as well, and have to step aside for a man hauling in a massive, gutted hog.)

Van Voris and Hunter have good chemistry as a married couple, and each delivers, as usual, a wonderful performance (Van Voris’ pole dance is brief but not to be missed). De Groat, who begins the production in turquoise leggings (a nice expression of character by costumer Ashton Edmonds) and works her way up the brightness scale from there, is a delight. She plays her ditzy, live-in-the-moment character with great skill.

The clever conceit here is that each boy already has the emotional issues or personality that will inform how he handles great, seemingly unlimited power. They can goof around, figuring out who can take a smack from a baseball and who can master flying first.

A: I guess that I'm here. Sometimes I feel like those cartoon characters after the explosion. They're like, "Whew! That was rough! But you know what? I'm on the other side now. It's all good."

I never look back, and I hate nostalgia in that way, but I can't believe how much time has gone by. Just working so hard, I never had time to come up for air and realize, whoa, it's been a while.

As a booker and organizer of folk events, he helped introduce the Garden State to the work of Nanci Griffith, John Gorka, Patty Larkin and others.

The e-mail he sent to city commissioners and the media Nov. 21 criticized police command staff for allowing Sgt. Kyle Nice and Officer Christopher Humphreys to remain on the street. Brennan specifically described a meeting he had with Reese, then Central Precinct commander, on Oct. 26, in which he raised concerns about Nice's response to a call to move along two homeless men playing music outside Huber's Restaurant a few nights earlier. He told Reese that Nice "grossly overreacted." Brennan said he had already persuaded the two men to walk away, when Nice arrived. He said the sergeant yelled that the two men weren't free to leave, and later, using coarse language, told them to get out of there, and if they said any more, they'd face arrest for disorderly conduct. Brennan said he stuck out his left arm in front of Nice, to keep the two sides from stepping toward each other.

Estrada is a prematurely gray 48-year-old who speaks excitedly. "El Infierno" is the third installment in his trilogy on Mexico. The first piece, "La Ley de Herodes" (Herod's Law) in 1999, won international acclaim and, in the view of many, helped bring down the authoritarian government that ruled Mexico for seven decades and that he parodied in the film. Now, Estrada says, things in Mexico have gotten only worse. Far from resolving the problems of poverty, political evil and social deterioration, the system in Mexico is more corroded, the dire situation exacerbated by an overlay of out-of-control narco-violence.
For example, after Rock made fun of Jude Law and other contemporary stars (himself included) for not quite measuring up to the greats, Sean Penn took it upon himself to issue a recriprocatory blast of windy pomposity.

The number of months people are out of work is just tragic, and I know the impact of being out of work for a long period of time, having seen it with people that I know and love. Being out of work a long period of time typically leads to depression, often to divorce, loss of faith  I mean its more than not just having a paycheck.

5. If you're a get-in-the-car-and-hit-the-road kind of traveler — and 80% to 90% of California vacationers do go by car, the Auto Club of Southern California says — you won't be immune from those aforementioned fuel-price increases, and you'll probably pay more for a roof over your head (see next item). Gasoline may top $5 a gallon by Memorial Day, GasBuddy.com has said. But Jeff Spring of the Auto Club noted that if the economy improves, the price increases may not affect the number of people who travel. They'll grin and bear it or trim the length of their trip.

If passed into law, the bills would improve wild and scenic protection and finally would make permanent the mineral withdrawal on national forestlands.

Cynics will argue that Haugen, as a Democrat, made a political decision in line with her party's ideology rather than a personal one. Yet she is a Democrat in a conservative-leaning district, and her vote took courage.

Chris Gregoire, a Catholic, was a longtime opponent of gay marriage who changed her views after years of internal debate, and is now an enthusiastic supporter. Yes, we can all get along — once people of all faiths understand that there's nothing morally upright about discrimination.

"He's filled in very well for Korpikoski," Tippett said. "He's a two-way player, strong on the boards, can play center, which gives him the ability to take a second center position out there.
