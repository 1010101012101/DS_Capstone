It started when a fan asked me if I thought the Beavers would ever play for a national championship in football under current head coach Mike Riley. I said no, because OSU doesn't have enough resources. (As in, money ... to build better facilities.) This fan said that if that's the case, the Beavers should fire Riley and hire someone different. I thought that was a ridiculous leap. Why should playing for national championships be the barometer for every program? That's completely unrealistic in my mind.

Turning point. With the Rockies' grip slipping on a three-run lead, Esmil Rogers faced the hottest hitter on the planet, Matt Kemp, with bases loaded and no outs in the seventh. Kemp homered in the first inning, his 12th in April, extending a club record. Rogers jumped ahead, and stayed brave. Rather than try to outmuscle Kemp with his 97 mph fastball, the right-hander threw back-to-back breaking pitches, striking out the slugger on an 86 mph curve on the inside corner. Rogers exited to a mini-standing ovation.

The war is on. Ajla is a Bosnian Muslim, and over the coming weeks she and the other women in town are rounded up by Serbian soldiers and bused to a camp. On the way, the soldiers shoot a man on a sidewalk with casual disregard. The women are terrified, as they should be.

The movement—named after béton brut, French for raw concrete, its main building material of choice—was strongly antibourgeois, and sought to replace the cold efficiency and utilitarianism of modernist office buildings with an even colder, almost forbidding sense of sculptural grandeur, a highly complex and monolithic geometry that is conceptually beautiful, if not aesthetically so.

Leaves make good additions to the soil too, but they are best composted first. When fresh oak leaves and other types are turned in with the soil, they tend to bind up nutrients plants need for growth.

If they are composted first and then mixed with the soil the decomposed, leaves start releasing nutrients the plants can use.

ESPN draft guru Todd McShay recently broke from the mock draft norm and had the Ravens selecting a defensive player (Notre Dame safety Harrison Smith) in the first round of April’s draft. McShay has obviously done his homework and knows way more about the draft than I will ever know. And I have heard that the Ravens do really like Smith and Alabama safety Mark Barron. However, my guess would still be that the Ravens go offensive line or wide receiver with their first pick. I think it would take a pretty attractive defensive option to fall to them to go that route. I could see a good pass rusher like Whitney Mercilus (Illinois) or Melvin Ingram (South Carolina) getting their undivided attention, but both are expected to be long gone by the time the Ravens pick at 29. I also think Alabama linebacker Dont’a Hightower would force them to make a difficult decision. However, his status is on the rise and now it appears that he’ll be gone by the time the Ravens pick as well. Ravens officials are expected to address the draft later this week. They’re obviously not going to reveal too much about their plans, but we should get a better idea on how they feel about certain players.

When you can't squeeze another cup out of that used teabag, feed it to your plants. Teabags can be used as an organic fertilizer for potted houseplants. You can even remove the tea leaves and mix them with the soil to help it retain moisture. If your problem is leaking bottom holes in plant containers, you can use teabags to prevent the leakage. This also works well for hanging planters.

Daniel finished college in 1983 and was quickly married with a child on the way. After five years as an oddsmaker and stand-up comedian, he figured he'd pulled together a nest egg big enough to finance a switch to acting.

Baldwin's real breakthrough came in 1993, as a star in the prime-time drama "Homicide: Life on the Street." Baldwin's character, the hard-living detective Beau Felton, lasted three seasons before he left the show, ostensibly to pursue a career in films.

But those hard choices will now be postponed until the 2012 election — when American voters have to decide whether they want a permanently weakened defense structure or are willing to use the savings from our withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan to modernize our military for the threats to come, from a nuclear Iran to a hegemony-minded China.

In decades past, the ratio of buy ratings to sell ratings had not been this lopsided, and in theory it should be roughly 50-50. That seems right, doesn't it? Some stocks go up, some go down, because of the overall market direction or competitive threats or issues specific to each company. In the late 1990s, though, the ratio was 100 buys or more for every sell. Merrill Lynch had buy ratings on 940 stocks and sell ratings on just 7. Salomon Smith Barney: 856 buy ratings, 4 sells. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter: 670 buys and exactly 0 sells.

The larger lesson is that, according to the latest research, these "deficits" are actually trade-offs. What seems, at first glance, like a straightforward liability turns out to be a complex mixture of blessings and burdens.
Darain Atkinson's mansion - an almost unfathomable money pit - didn't simply bring down the man. He directed his company, Wentzville-based US Fidelis, to pay $26.7 million of the construction costs.

Referring to the Madigan cases, Murray said, “If it’s the matter of trying to weed people out because there are fewer resources, that is absolutely wrong, absolutely wrong. If it’s because Madigan has implemented a system that has more correct diagnosis, then we need to know that.”

U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag's office declined to comment about Oakland's move Tuesday to increase its dispensaries, but medical cannabis advocates said stepped-up federal prosecution was the primary reason the city received only 12 permit applications﻿.
"Construction lost a huge number of jobs in the last few years because of the housing situation and essentially people weren't building things," Mantell said. "Assuming that housing picks up, which I'm assuming that it will, some of that construction jobs increase will be in the housing area."
Outdoor feeding stations were set up. The settings were plain -- long benches and long wooden tables. The food was pretty plain, too, often a concoction called "earthquake stew," lots of potatoes, a little meat, a lot of meal.
Meanwhile, city officials hired a physician to examine Sellers to verify his medical condition.
Myanmar has avoided the rapid, often rampant development seen in Thailand and other parts of Asia because of decades of isolation brought on by harsh military rule. But as foreign investors begin pouring in, activists in what was once known as Burma say endemic corruption, virtually nonexistent environmental laws and a long-repressed civil society make it "ripe for environmental rape."

Since then, this absurdly broad "substantial effects" doctrine has proven spacious enough to accommodate virtually everything Congress has tried to do under the pretext of regulating interstate commerce.
For walnuts, the cleaning process is simple and quick: The outside of the shell is washed with a dilute solution of bleach and water, then rinsed several times, dried and packaged. The process doesn't affect the nuts at all.
_ Worst-case outcome: In parliamentary elections next month, French voters elevate far-left politicians. To assuage them, Hollande boosts spending sharply and rejects austerity and other reforms aimed at stabilizing France's debt load.

Kevin Pelton, Basketball Prospectus: Thabeet's size is always going to be intriguing for NBA teams. If placed in a situation where he could anchor a zone defense with his shot-blocking ability and finish a few times at the rim, Thabeet could have some value off the bench. However, according to NBA.com/Stats, the Blazers were outscored by a crazy 29.8 points per 100 possessions when Thabeet played this season, so I don't see this experiment as one worth continuing.
Interstate Realty Management spokeswoman Laura Zaner said company officials, along with representatives from the mayor's office and the police department, were meeting with residents to address their concerns about inadequate security.

Trotz said he expected Lindback to practice on Tuesday.
Tuesday felt like an opening night. The basketball wasn't clean. The passes weren't crisp. Even the public address announcer mistakenly followed a Jared Dudley two-pointer with "basket by Chris Dudley." Anytime now, I'm sure the John Kitzhaber campaign is going to ask the basketball team for equal time.

Cosgrove apologized for the manner in which the decision was delivered, while reminding us of the prior conversation that could have taken Huron in a different direction.
West believes that the king rules not merely because he’s got the weaponry to blow you away, but because he’s more cultured than you are. This is a running theme in his work: Exclusive brand names are not merely a mark of conspicuous consumption, they’re also a reservoir of symbolic force. All over "Watch the Throne," West and Jay-Z drop the names of artists, designers, historical and mythological figures, gods and monsters. The cover of this album is folded gold leaf. "It’s time for us to stop and redefine black power," raps West on "Murder to Excellence," the stop-you-in-your-tracks centerpiece of the new album. (Another song, "N--- as in Paris," imagines rappers "going gorillas" in the French capital and seizing Old World prestige for themselves.) He wants fewer guns and more fashion, less puritan austerity and more blunted beauty. Themes he first explored on the autobiographical "Everything I Am" reach fruition here: "Watch the Throne" presents the artist-king as a clear-eyed hedonist and discriminating cultural consumer, the refined curator of a life lived on the grandest scale imaginable.
How do I see this feud unfolding? I love that Lesnar is mysterious and is a monster right now. Because he wasn't the best promo guy in his time with WWE to begin with, I would envision him saying very few words and letting his actions do the talking. While The Rock saw Hollywood “change” his Rock persona and make him a softer, more smiley Rock (a hybrid between Rock and Dwayne Johnson, if you will), Lesnar's time in the UFC, if anything, made him meaner and more matter-of-fact. Was Lesnar the best in-ring competitor? No, but Cena has a history of presenting an entertaining match with an opponent of any skill level. Can this feud build slowly? Absolutely it can. Though WWE is big with social media, particularly Twitter, I think it would be a great idea for Lesnar not to embrace Twitter. During his time in the UFC, he didn't seem to do so either (@DCBrockLesnar). Lesnar is a quiet guy who is easily rattled (past UFC press conferences dictate that) and gets easily annoyed with opponents. What's a more perfect opportunity to let Brock adopt that very persona in WWE and blur the lines? The story of a former UFC Heavyweight champion and the biggest draw in the UFC now turning back to WWE is a big one and a marketable one.

Bickering over the cultural superiority of the city versus the superior public education in parts of the county is a waste of time. What matters is elevating the region so all of our children have opportunities at successful lives and memories of happy childhoods.

Why are Americans such wusses? Threaten the Greeks with job losses and benefit cuts and they tie up Athens, but take away Americans' jobs, 401(k)s, even their homes, and they pretty much roll over. Tell British students that their tuition is about to go up and they take to the streets; American students just amp up their doses of Prozac.

Wait, that feature was supposed to be functional last year, wasn't it? I remember it distinctly. Apple kept promoting it as part of the launch of iCloud.

GSHS Chairman Rodney Seelig of New York said "We do have hopes of having a second week next year," speculating that one three-day show might be unrecognized by the U.S. Equestrian Federation, while the following week would be recognized and maintain its AA status. If dates are available, Seelig said the idea eventually would be to have two weeks of recognized competition.

Technically, they now have two new helmets, three new jerseys (in gold, black, white and a matted gray that is being called "anthracite") and four new pairs of pants that provide Mizzou with the ability to come up with no fewer than 24 combinations every week if they want to. If you read the news release or talked to the Nike representative who was there Saturday, there are any number of gushy, over-the-top techno phrases that they use to describe the collaborative creative process that led to the uniform redesign.

However, I’m still fending off people calling for defensive coordinator Perry Fewell's head, which amazes me. This team is headed to the postseason and the defense has given up only four touchdowns the past two weeks (two of which came on short field). I would think that would be enough. And the funny part is if they continue to play well over the coming weeks, these same folks will want him to stay even though he’ll go back to being a hot head-coaching candidate.
The end isn't officially here yet for the Metrodome. But then again, it really is.

Agreed, Steven. But at this point, I think it's obvious Mike Quade is not going to start playing Campana, preferring to use his speed off the bench. I'm not sure that he is "the future," but it would be nice to see what Campana could do if he actually got a chance to play once in a while.
Here are 10 reasons to strike out on a nonprofit career path:
Jack Hannahan knows all about the sharp turns that can take place over 162 games. He opened the season as the Indians starting third baseman, a surprise since he spent all of 2010 in the minors.

"I am glad to report Kyle's concussion tests have been extremely positive, and we are grateful he is ready and anxious to get back to competition," Williams said in the statement. "Personally, suspension or not, it's probably best I'm never in a room with Gregg Williams and wonder if such an order crosses the line of the aggressive, competitive spirit we all know and love about the sport and leans closer to a criminal act and therefore a litigious matter.
“He prepares like a maniac,” Razzano said.

Not 20 feet away from her, the little girl's father, who had taken off work to be in the courtroom, bowed his head. When deputies had brought Hayden -- shackled and in a blue jail uniform -- into the courtroom, the father could not bear to look at him. He kept his head down. He glanced up only when a sheriff's deputy tapped him on the shoulder with a box of tissues.
The early loss of Helm's energy and aggressive forechecking certainly contributed to Nashville's 3-2 victory. But this loss was more about a playoff hockey adage: To the victor goes the fortuitous bounce.
Foreigners are attracted to U.S. real estate because their local currencies are so much stronger than the dollar. Investors are also attracted to the properties because rents are rising.

The special election was being held after Guinea-Bissau's president died in January from diabetes-related complications. Fears of a military coup have grown since his funeral, when power was handed over to interim President Raimundo Pereira. The chronically unstable nation has been beset by coups since its independence from Portugal in 1974, and its ruler Joao Bernardo "Nino" Vieira was assassinated inside his home in 2009.
“We have enough houses to sell here in West Orange,” said candidate Jill Tekel. “We need to bring back ratables. Not more cars, more people, more streets and more taxes.”
It was like I was in a real-life Olivia Newton-John "Let's Get Physical" workout video! Randomly, my concentration would be broken when someone would yell out "Wahoo!" or "yaoowww!"
The woman and her bag were rescreened and allowed to proceed to the gate area. And in another incident at Terminal B, screening at Checkpoint 3 was halted for 12 minutes on Friday, when a passenger flagged during a full-body scan walked out of the screening area before being rescreened.

"Absolutely it's the right thing to do," said Dr. Errol Soskolne, chairman of the department of pediatrics at St. Joseph Mercy, Ann Arbor, which also started performing the test. "You wouldn't want to not do it" and risk problems going undetected, he said.
Thanks to the patient efforts of some tantalizingly attractive therapists, he learns to communicate by blinking. Through a tedious process, he dictates his thoughts, which turn into a memoir, the basis for this film.
Here, though, we have John Madden (“Shakespeare in Love”) directing a treasure trove of top-notch British actors who bring professionalism and humanity to a leisurely story that never sinks under the weight of a sentimental script.

One of Mary's co-workers told me, "On the day the shutdown was announced, we had a ceremony in the living room – we cut up all the credit cards." For many people this is a recommended reaction to the loss of a job.
The Angels' No.5 starter faced only one batter over the minimum before walking Denard Span with two out in the ninth. Alexi Casilla grounded into a double play after Span opened the game with a single, and Span was picked off first base to end the third. Span's two hits extended his career-best hitting streak to 12 games.
The case remained dormant for seven years, until Jan. 4, when the Chicago Sun-Times requested records of the investigation. Top Chicago Police Department brass then ordered a new investigation, and detectives determined that the 6-foot-3, 230-pound Vanecko punched the 5-foot-5, 140-pound Koschman but did so in self-defense. They closed the case March 1 without seeking criminal charges.
Senate Majority Leader Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex) doubts the bill can pass. "There’s no support in the Senate for any of the proposals that have been put forth in the Pennacchio bill," she said.

Posko will take over an organization with an operating budget of approximately $15 million, said Mark Bendann, Habitat's chief operating officer. Bendann said the nonprofit was on track to build 49 homes this fiscal year, which ends in June.
Sure, it features the folk and guitar legend performing some of his best and darkest songs, but he also plays goalie in a street hockey game with his son. The film covers the breadth of Thompson's huge career, from Fairport Convention to his current place as a captivating solo performer. So it has to cover ground quickly. We learn he's a creature of the suburbs, and he makes that seem like a pretty decent thing. The interviews with ex-wife Linda Thompson are especially interesting, as interviews with ex-wives often are.
"But the thing is, he came in and didn't play early, but he didn't lose his enthusiasm. He understood that practices were his games and he played very hard. He earned minutes, and when the opportunity came, he was ready. And I think it makes everyone feel good."
Now, the district is trying a different approach to getting educators off the payroll. Several educators, including Cotman, Pitts and Davis Williams, were notified their contracts would not be renewed next school year. When a contract is “nonrenewed” an administrator isn’t entitled to the same job protection rights as one whose contract is terminated while in progress.
The Chiefs missed out on signing quarterback Peyton Manning, but they appear to have an interest in one of his favorite receivers.
This is the third year that New Line has offered a $1,000 scholarship to a senior in the St. Louis area who plans to study musical theater in college (and the third year that I have had the privilege of selecting the winner from among the finalists - always a real challenge!) The 2010 winner, Matt Dumke of Kirkwood High School, now attends Missouri State University. The 2009 winner, Jake Fruend of Webster Groves High School, is a student at Columbia College in Chicago and was the directing intern for New Line's production of "Evita" last year.
Cobb knows, from experience, that it can be done, but he also knows the cost. Still, if he can complete this one last job, it'll mean being cleared of a crime he was set up for, and seeing his beloved children, from whom he has been separated. Thus he brings more members to the team - Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a chemist who will take care of putting everyone into a dream state; Eames (Tom Hardy, so great as the title character in "Bronson" and exceptional here, as well), a "forger," who can impersonate people in dreams; and Ariadne (Ellen Page), an architecture student brought in to help construct the dreamscapes in which the inception will take place. Why does Cobb need an architect? Can't he build his own dreams? Ah, he can. But he won't. The reason why is a part of the story best discovered for yourself.
Burglary--On April 16 between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. in the 800 block of Silacci Drive. An iPad, MacBook and other items were stolen.
"I'm sure there will be lot of ads that attack Rob Portman for everything that is bad about George Bush," he said. "Rob Portman is not George Bush and not responsible for everything bad that has happened."
Recognizing the need for some veteran leadership, and the presence of a few grownups in the locker room, and on the court, the Wizards shipped Young to the L.A. Clippers and McGee to the Denver Nuggets, and added 10-year veteran Nene to the roster. From the day the trade was made, the difference in franchise point guard John Wall was immediate and obvious. Wall enjoys playing with Nene, far more than he did with McGee.
The stomach-shrinking procedure is for men 100 or more pounds overweight, women 80 plus, or people who are less overweight but who also have diabetes, heart disease or sleep apnea. But this is not a "get healthy in an instant" scheme. Afterward, to get healthy for the long term, you have to change your eating patterns and get up and get moving.
In his last three starts, Jimenez has pitched five, six and six innings, and he has thrown 112, 107 and 113 pitches. His inability to pitch deep into games has been a problem since he came to Cleveland in a trade with Colorado in the middle of the 2011 season.

Prosecutors also say Lester Mullet's request to go free before trial should be rejected since he "joyfully" participated in the attacks last fall and said he would do it again, according to a filing on Thursday.
The Greek vote is less predictable. Thirty-two parties are standing, and the last poll in mid-April suggested 10 may enter parliament. Pasok and New Democracy, the two largest parties that broadly support the program set by the International Monetary Fund and European Commission, may not be able to deliver a coalition. Of the 10 parties likely to win seats, seven oppose the IMF program and two want to exit from the euro, Credit Suisse notes. Meanwhile, the IMF is expecting another €3 billion ($3.95 billion) of spending cuts to be implemented straight after the elections and another €12 billion for 2013-2014, UBS notes.

In government, the hardest hit were employees of school districts, counties and cities, who combined accounted for the vast majority of the lost government jobs. State government, on the other hand, lost a few thousand jobs while the federal government actually increased its job offerings in California by a few thousand, all in the Department of Defense.

The lyrical intermezzi of the final movement featured wonderful interactions between clarinet and solo cello, and later a memorable passage for solo flute. The enigmatic closing pages of this work did not sound episodic. Gerard Schwarz kept the music airborne and pressing forward to great effect. He got a great sound from the HSO brass section that was quite distinctive as the work came to a close and in several other key moments during this expressive and powerful concerto.
Officials said that, overall, the proposal could increase federal borrowing by $900 billion.
LANSING  The state House approved a series of bills Thursday to modify Michigans medical marijuana law, proposing rules for doctor-patient relationships, law enforcement access to the patient registry and requiring medical marijuana to be kept inaccessible in vehicles.
Many Democratic lawmakers believe the governor’s ultimate goal all along has been to redirect New Jersey’s share of the tunnel project into the nearly bankrupt state Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for road and bridge repairs and transit services. That would enable Christie to avoid increasing the gas tax to pay for the fund, generally considered a politically unpopular move.
How the triad happens is not fully understood, Prather said. There's probably no one mechanism driving it though medical experts suspect an energy imbalance leads to irregular menstrual cycles. And they do know that not menstruating can permanently affect bone mass.
Second, because we're still in the throes of Thanksgiving excess, I decided to offer more than a one-on-one showdown.
On Three Mile Island, the radiation leak was held inside the containment shell — thick concrete armor around the reactor. The Chernobyl reactor had no shell and was also operational when the disaster struck. The Japanese reactors automatically shut down when the quake hit and are encased in containment shells.
The central bank was reacting to a slowdown in global growth, particularly in China, a big buyer of Australian natural resources.
McCoy wasn't Young, not even close. But Young wasn't so hot in the NFL after winning Rookie of the Year honors. The "sophomore jinx" occurred because other teams adjusted to his style and also because he wasn't the best athlete on the field by a lot anymore. Scheme recognition and decision-making became much more important than at Texas, where coach Mack Brown memorably told Young, "Just play."
Tybor says the high court will evaluate how the pilot programs proceed in those counties before expanding. He says there's no immediate timetable for that evaluation.

The pairings: Of the four-star restaurants, Fleur de Lys was the least sophisticated in matching wine and food. Even with nearly 1,000 wines on the list, the pairings seemed predictable and safe -- 2000 Domaine Trimbach Pinot Gris with the trio of soups, 2003 Matanzas Creek Sauvignon Blanc with a soft-shell crab on spinach leaves with piquillo pepper coulis and lobster succotash, and 2001 Havens Merlot with the lamb main course.
Christie also defended the rules describing the relationship patients must have with a doctor vouching for the severity of their illness. A doctor must have been treating a patient for a year, seen the patient at least four times, or be a hospice doctor who has reviewed the terminal patient’s records, Walsh said.
Murray said that she learned from her campaign that many residents strongly opposed the special financing. She said she wanted to be "their voice on the council."
It’s its own thing — and sometimes, admitted, it gets lost in its own wanderings. The story easily could have been sped up by five or 10 minutes. And although the late appearance of one movie icon is fine, an invocation of “Apocalypse Now” is both old and off-track.
"Immediate action was taken to assist the student, while at the same time a search for the suspect was initiated and ongoing," said Laura A. Wankel, vice president for Student Affairs, in a statement.

"It's supereasy - nothing to be afraid of. No pain at all," says Pihl, 39. "Blood products can't be manufactured. They have to be donated. If you meet the requirements, it's a totally selfless thing to do. I actually leave there, and I feel so good."
BY THE NUMBERS: 51 2/3 -- Cubs starting pitchers have worked 51 2/3 innings over the first eight games. They entered the day tops in the NL with 46 2/3. The Cardinals were second at 43 1/3, but Cubs batters knocked Adam Wainwright out after three innings.
Morris eventually changed his mind — just in time, it would seem. He interviewed last week, and Bear Creek announced his hiring this morning.
He felt "the chain of evidence was lost, for one thing," Marilyn Rose said. "It would have been helpful if other doctors who had worked on Kennedy would have been able to put in their expertise. Also, the autopsy that was done was very inadequate."

In both his songwriting and onstage persona, Ebert, 34, has impressively embodied his creation, generating a cult-like aura and a devoted musical following. Tall, lanky, long-haired and bearded, he performs in a near-ecstatic fashion, often sans shirt and shoes, arms flailing, perched at the edge of the stage so as to reach down toward his euphoric audience. It's a scene that could easily be mistaken for a kind of tent revival or hippie camp somewhere in the middle of a desert.

"There has to be big pieces out there," SETI Institute meteor astronomer Peter Jenniskens said before the trip. "We're just hoping to collect more meteorites for research."
Q: I have a newly renovated bathroom with Craftsman cabinets, black and white tiles, a black countertop and a clawfoot tub. The walls are a light blue. It looks great, but there is a space at the top of the cabinet that cries for decoration.

Rep. Steve LaTourette, a Republican from Bainbridge Township, plans to take a few days off to visit a beach with his family -- his staff would only say the beach is in the United States -- before returning to a schedule of local events, including a visit to Geauga County's fair. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, is taking a few days off to spend time with his children and grandchild in Ohio, and will also take a short vacation "within driving distance" of the state, his office says.
PG&E has already acknowledged that it failed to conduct federally required leak surveys on more than 20 miles of its distribution system in the East Bay and elsewhere. The state utilities commission has levied a $16.8 million fine for the company's failure to check some of that mileage.

After Harry S. Truman became president in 1945, he called on Congress to provide national health insurance but could never bring it to a vote.

Tax experts say the problems at the state level could spread to Washington, as the highest earners gain a larger share of both national income and the tax burden. The top 1% paid 38% of federal income taxes in 2008, up from 25% in 1991, and they earned 20% of all national income in 2008, up from 13% in 1991, according to the Tax Foundation.
Meticulous preparation as well as high standards are what make his sushi so good. Fanatical about the smallest details, he makes his associates hand-massage octopus for 45 minutes before it is considered ready to serve. And one assistant talks of preparing egg sushi that was not up to the master's standards 200 times over a four-month period. The first time Ono said it met the mark, the man cried.
Ahead of state and federal governments, which are now catching up, Klein introduced the use of data to assess student and school performance. That's why every school gets a report card. That's why teachers can closely track how every student is doing. That's why the next chancellor will be able to identify the weakest teachers using measurable data. And that's largely why New York State won $700 million in federal Race to the Top funding.
"He's not feeling anything," McIntyre says. "He's not aware what's going on."
About 4,600 claimants filed for development rights under Measure 49. The state official in charge of approving them says the grumbling is overstated.

Both are staunch union supporters and foes of trade agreements they believe will export jobs. Harriet Applegate, who heads Cleveland's North Shore AFL-CIO Federation of Labor, describes them as "champions of ordinary people over corporations and Wall Street." She expects her organization will support Kucinich because "he is our hometown guy," and her AFL-CIO counterparts in Toledo will back Kaptur for the same reason.
This is more of a debate about where our oil comes from than about price. The price of oil is set globally, after all. When we are asleep, oil prices are being set in Asia and then in Europe. Unless the United States can shut off all reliance on all foreign oil, something that is not projected, those markets will still influence price.
Although it's been 20 years since the release of their breakthrough album, "Dónde Jugarán Los Niños," last night's sold out concert at the US Airways Center in Phoenix, proved the lasting power the band's music has maintained over the years.

To the extent that we rely on skilled architects and landscape architects to manage this transition, there is much to gain. In the case of the Ellipse — much of which was originally laid out in the mid-19th century by Andrew Jackson Downing, and which is among the most visited open spaces in Washington — the decision by Rogers Marvel to wrap the site in a secure wall will clear the way for both formal and informal gatherings in front of the White House even as it promises to substantially improve the experience of walking or playing on the grass.
