• Stoudemire believes one of the best ways to deal with the Heat is to slow down their offense, wrote Jared Zwerling of ESPNNewYork.com: "'Miami's a team that plays great getting turnovers, and they get out and run well,' said Amare Stoudemire after the Knicks beat the Bobcats on Thursday night 104-84 in both teams' regular-season finale. 'So if we can contain our turnovers and contain their fast break, we've got a great chance to win. Half-court defensively, we're playing as one of the best in the league, but it's easier said than done. It's going to be a tough battle, regardless.'... There's no denying how good the Heat are in transition, but when the pace slows down and they have to initiate their half-court offense, that can be a different story. One of their biggest weaknesses is half-court execution when the game bogs down, which is what the playoffs are all about. Grind-out possessions."

These centers provide a program of social activities, health management and assistance with daily activities that allow individuals to remain in their home but receive daily services in a professional setting. While we understand the fiscal challenges facing Maryland, this tax should not be part of the solution. With the projected growth in Maryland's senior population, Maryland should be promoting community based services, the preferred choice for many individuals, not taxing them.

I bend down to inspect the suitcase, and to my amazement there is the Eiffel Tower logo, assuring my disbelieving eyes that this is indeed a Travelpro, and it is outwardly pristine.

Jesmyn Ward was struggling. Despite two master's degrees and five years of work experience, her job situation was difficult: She commuted an hour each way to a low-paying college teaching job.

It also had ride quality sponsored by the American Dental Association, especially in the V-8-powered FX45 version.

We followed him on a circuitous route down city streets and dark alleys. Just as we were starting to fear he was leading us into trouble, we emerged into a well-lit plaza, where cabbies vied for our fare back to the ship. We offered our guide the rest of our Barbados dollars, but he indignantly refused, hugged us goodbye, and disappeared into the night.

Small big labels. While most of the intellectual interest in Champagne lies in the growers, they still account for about 4 percent of the U.S. market.

So I readjusted my snorkel, inhaled and pumped down toward the reef. Some members of our 19-member sailing expedition were already there, peering into an orange coral bigger than an armchair.

The emails' writers include public relations people, lawyers, and top police officials, including a deputy police chief, Jeffrey Israel, who has since been demoted to captain.

Myself, I wish I could hear more about just how reason and intellect rule out Branch Davidianism. Once you're prepared to accept miracles, once anything goes, how do you set limits on irrationality? And eyewitnesses? Surely Justice Scalia is aware of the now vast research regarding the unreliability of eyewitness testimony to — how to put this politely? — anything. I'll leave alone the witness of witnesses witnessing their own beliefs. The virtual definition, I believe, of sainthood.

It's definitely a group effort. Under host and sommelier Joel Gunderson's stewardship, St. Jack attempts to re-create the Lyonnaise tradition of buying wines by the barrel, some custom-made for St. Jack. Alyssa Rozos, who was sous pastry chef at New York's Daniel, preps pastries from a princess's dream -- pink raspberry macaroons, éclairs, and her after-meal signature: tiny, just-baked madeleines served warm and delicious. Bartender Kyle Webster brings a steady hand to the craft cocktail list, and he also built the French-themed playlist, which builds from old-timey 1920s French tunes through Serge Gainsbourg hits of the '60s before crescendoing into a mix of low-volume French pop and hip-hop.

For most seniors, this will be the first Part B premium increase since 2009. For the past two years, most beneficiaries' Medicare fees went unchanged because of a "hold harmless" law, which barred the government from increasing them without a cost-of-living adjustment to Social Security.
At its most basic, cancer is a disease of miscommunication. Cells get their cues on how to act from their own DNA from other cells, and from the environment around them.

The 80-page booklet for the boxed set will not be a standard one. Spiral-bound, it’s intended to look like the beat-up notebook that Springsteen used to rewrite songs, play around with potential track orders for the album, and make other notes related to the project. In the documentary, Springsteen’s notebook practically becomes a character unto itself. E Street Band members wince when they see it, knowing their boss will be asking for yet more revisions, yet more takes (at one point, they start taking bets on his “whims of the day”).

Separately, Cleveland and Cordray are waiting to see if the Ohio Supreme Court will accept a different case concerning the city's right to regulate firearms. The Ohio legislature tried to remove that right in late 2006, with supporters saying the state needed consistency across local borders rather than a smorgasbord of local gun regulations. Cordray defended the legislature's position, as is his job, and asked the Ohio Supreme Court to weigh in after a state appeals court ruled in Cleveland's favor.

Take the STL Cinemas chain. Harman Moseley, the owner, says attendance at his four theaters drops by about half on postseason game nights. He gets it - he, too, plans to spend the next three nights at home to watch the games on TV. That trend, though, isn't hot for movie ticket sales.
The book also details the enormous personal challenges and limitations Schuller overcame. It talks about a life of poverty during the Great Depression, shucking corn in the fields of Iowa. At one time, Schuller sold postage stamps to the post office to buy milk for his children, Sheila and Robert. It talks about that phone call Schuller and his wife got when they were in Korea that their 13-year-old daughter, Carol, lost her leg in a motorcycle accident. It details Arvella Schuller's battle against breast cancer and Robert Schuller's own brain surgery after a car accident where he hit his head against the door and almost died.

One thing that has surprised me slightly is that finding another veteran running back to replace the retired Ricky Williams doesn’t appear to be very high on the Ravens’ offseason to-do list. Perhaps, team officials are being coy. Or perhaps, they feel like Williams, who didn’t completely close the door on a return, will ultimately reconsider and be back. Or perhaps, they saw enough in practice from rookies Anthony Allen and Damien Berry to believe that they are more than capable of stepping up and filling a back-up role behind Rice. Either way, it still would surprise me if the Ravens didn’t add a veteran running back before the start of training camp.
An investigation into the accident pointed to a 19-inch length of four-by-four lumber as the likely cause. The wood got hung up on a piece of concrete downhill from where the Roche's sewer line tied into a larger collector line.

It has been painful to watch. Not only has it made Romney into an inconsistent foil to his own record -- which in Massachusetts and other endeavors has been about pragmatic problem-solving, not ideological windmill-tilting -- it has also hurt his general election prospects. For the past few weeks in particular, the polls have shown Romney trailing President Barack Obama -- nationwide and in key swing states, in some cases by significant margins.
