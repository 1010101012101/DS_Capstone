Fair enough -- and so what? What's crucial about Boswell's book is not that all the relevant categories are not appropriately filled in but that the author created the categories.

Facing the reality of running as a bruised incumbent in a politically divided country, Obama's advisors say they are plotting a strategy that doesn't depend on a wave of support to lift the president's chances across the country.

Why it's hot: The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa stands apart from the rest of the club and bar scene by virtue of one simple fact — the casino is on Seminole land, making it exempt from last call restrictions. Floyd's, the nightclub inside Hard Rock, is open 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The music is generally hip-hop on Fridays and house and electro on Saturdays; you'll want to arrive before midnight if you want to pay only half of the $20 cover. While Floyd's and the Center and Lobby bars are very popular during normal hours (the Lobby Bar gets especially packed on weekends, when DJs play a solid mix of dance tunes from the last four decades), it's the after-hours action that many come for. On weekends you can stay at the Center or Lobby bars until 5 a.m., where you'll find many after-hours types that aren't as interested in the club scene as they are in getting a drink when nobody else will serve one. This includes many people working in bars in Ybor, who head to the casino at the end of their shift.

Even in Latin America we are not free of international politics, as countries on other continents have made substantial gains in this region.

Pages 135 to 144: Andrea Leckey was hiking with her 12- and 13-year-old children and the family dog when she heard loud talking followed by gunshots. She was asked how many shots. Answer: Two and two -- so four altogether. She was asked how much time elapsed between the shots. Answer: Well not much, but it was like two, boom-boom, boom-boom. Question: In between the first boom-boom and the second boom-boom, did you hear any more loud talking? Answer: Um, I heard not yelling ... but just loud talking. Leckey said since she had her children with her, she paused on the trail leading down to the parking lot, uncertain what to do. She waited to see if anyone was running but saw people just walking. She wondered if it was nothing. She encountered three other hikers and asked them if that had sounded like gunfire to them. They said, "Yes, something is going on. There is a police officer yelling for someone to put the knife down and we decided to walk away from it." Leckey waited a few minutes more and began to hear police sirens so she decided it was safe to return to her car in the parking lot. She had parked near the visitor center so her children could use the restroom, so the path back to her car took her past the scene. They saw a body lying on the ground. She said she couldn't see the front of the man because he was facing away. She said there were police officers there and she saw one officer hugging another officer. Before she drove away she spoke briefly to a park employee who told her the police wanted to clear the parking lot. She didn't talk to police at the scene and was contacted later after police had seen her being interviewed on the news.

A collection of previously unreleased Hendrix music, “Valleys of Neptune,” hit stores and online outlets on March 9, and has led to a fresh round of publicity for the rock-guitar giant (he’s on the cover of the current edition of Rolling Stone magazine). But guitarists at Wednesday’s show stuck mostly to the classics.

I have been watching the surreal drama that is playing out in Washington, just another insignificant American citizen, wondering when the curtain will fall on the histrionics. I hope after all the confrontations and clashes the debt ceiling will be raised in the last minute, House Speaker John Boehner will appear on talk shows, his eyes moist, claiming victory, and President Obama will go off on his fundraisers, telling the world that for America to survive as we know it, we need new taxes — but I cannot be sure.

For many, an office at home but not in the home is proving to be the best way to reconcile work and family life. Filmmaker and commercial director John Dolan said he chose a detached structure in his Studio City, Calif., backyard even though he could work in an office in Hollywood.

3. Brandon Weeden, QB, Oklahoma State. Criticize his team relative to LSU and Alabama if you must, but the Cowboys needed every bit of Weeden's 502 yards and four touchdowns to outshoot Kansas State 52-45. Weeden did throw two interceptions, but then again, he's a quarterback who's willing to take some chances—nothing wrong with that in our book.

New Jersey's eagerness to make a deal before the deadline might have been affected by the decision of Orlando center Dwight Howard to exercise his option with the Magic for next season. Howard was believed to have been leaning toward teaming with Nets point guard Deron Williams. But Howard made a late decision to remain in Orlando through next season, and the Nets scrambled to piece together a deal that could entice Williams to stay with them. Williams can opt out of his contract this summer and become an unrestricted free agent.

When I tapped one of those artists, Nina Simone, a similar panel slid into view with her information, with the Aretha panel moving to the left of the screen. You can continue to display or peel back these overlapping panels. There is the danger that this can get out of hand, with one panel on top of another on top of another, but this approach worked for me. I like how you get a quick progression of artists, the people who influenced them and quick access to many of the songs you'll almost certainly want to play on the spot.

Pendergraph is a second-year player who blew out his right knee in the Blazers' second preseason game. The injury will sideline him for the season. According to a source, the Blazers are engaged in trade discussions and will keep Pendergraph as an asset that could help make a trade work financially. The Blazers have until 3 p.m. Monday to finalize their roster. If they are unable to make a deal, Pendergraph will be waived.

But don’t tell that to the producers of “Brooklyn 11223” — a reality show set to stink up our shores next month on the Oxygen network. With its caricatures of slutty “guidos” totally lacking in manners and sexual restraint, who bear the absence of a vocabulary beyond “fuhgeddaboudit!” the show cements the basest bigotry. For Italians today may represent the last group that TV producers are permitted to malign. It’s also fun and profitable.

I would like to know what happened to the coverage of boys swimming in the newspaper. My son swims in the GAC. They had their GAC championships and there was nothing in the paper about who won each race. I think it's really terrible that these kids work so hard every single day and the kids who got medals never even got recognized in the paper. There was one article and it only spoke about the boy from Timberland. I think it's really rotten. We pay to have the newspaper come to us; a big reason why is so that we can see the stuff in the sports section because our son plays sports. I hope you will post who won the races in the GAC.
And a look back at 2010:
With "The Ides of March," however, there's a distinction that could work in its favor. Though the film revolves around a Democratic presidential candidate — a stirring, seemingly populist Pennsylvania governor named Mike Morris (played by Clooney) — the story is hardly some liberal screed. Instead, the screenplay, adapted by Beau Willimon from his play "Farragut North" and reworked by Clooney and longtime collaborator Grant Heslov (all three share scriptwriting credit), proves a harshly cynical look at a win-at-all-costs political process propelled by the increasingly corrupt Morris.
The Celtics broke out of a halftime tie and outscored the Nets, 26-13 in the third quarter on the way to a comfortable 94-82 victory before a Prudential Center crowd that featured plenty of Celtics green in the seats.

I'm not really a writer. Luckily I live in an age where less emphasis is put on grammatical errors and composition, and more on what story it is you're trying to tell. I'm certainly not an investigative writer, no digger of facts. I guess my talent lies in being very able to say what I feel. It has been a soothing remedy to be able to speak frankly about the people, places and situations in my life that have the most meaning. It boils down to family, frankly.

The report concluded that expediency seems to dominate equity. Instead of taking into account a defendant's economic circumstances, as required by the state "Harris County rarely deviates from its predetermined bail schedules." Jailing people who have not yet been convicted of even a petty crime is unjust - and costly to taxpayers, the report said. "The rigidity of these rules contributes to high pre-trial detention rates in Harris County and exacerbates the County's budget woes."

Not that it doesn't face its dangers. Audiences and choreographers have moved on to a swifter, more compact style of storytelling (or of not telling a story at all), and a lot of people these days find those swoonily tragic Romantic-era stories a bit tough to swallow. Beyond that, as the American and world economies turn to sawdust, every arts organization needs to worry: In such harrowing times, how will they meet their own constantly challenged budgets?

In their time, the daughters of the second Baron Redesdale, better known as the Mitford sisters, were an industry. Their trade, for the most part, was their mere existence — swanning about British society, leaving scandal and newsprint in their wake. Nancy wrote deliciously acidic novels and gossipy history. (Evelyn Waugh dedicated "The Loved One" to her.) Diana and Unity were avowed fascists. Adolf Hitler was a witness at Diana's wedding to Oswald Mosely, and Unity was so besotted with the Führer and chagrined when Britain declared war on Germany that she tried to kill herself. Deborah and Pamela were more reserved, but the tabloids avidly detailed all the sisters' fashions, marriages, politics and real estate.
Sen. Reid's motivation is obvious. He knows very well serious problems exist. He knows very well tax increases cannot begin to scratch the surface of a solution. He knows very well entitlement reforms/cuts are necessary and unavoidable, but he has a personal problem. Sen.

Justice for Trayvon Martin means more than arresting and trying George Zimmerman for his death ("License to kill," March 23). It means building communities where our black sons are free to walk the streets and be children, safe from the perception of neighbors and community members who believe that to be a young, black manchild is to be bad and to desire to bring harm to others. To focus on our black sons is not to say that our other sons and daughters are less important and less valuable. It is to be honest and to recognize the treacherous plight of young, black males from infancy through adulthood. We must stand our ground for our black sons and agree to engage with one another and to have the hard conversations about race, fairness, equity, justice, civility and the meaning of community. For these are all our children; and we will pay or profit for whatever they become.

Q: Our patio has a north-facing wall that receives little, if any, direct sunlight, even in midsummer. We would appreciate any suggestions about what we could plant there -- preferably something that would grow on a trellis.

I've got my copy of the liner notes to "Speak Now," and I have decoded the secret message inserted into the printed lyrics. I know this song is dedicated to Adam, and she doesn't mean Adam Lazzara. I hope. That guy has enough women to contend with. Swift is not having the easiest time with the high notes here, and I'm beginning to worry that she emptied the tank on "Dear John." She could use a little Auto-Tune. Adam Young might have helped out with that.

Hey, Tony: How would you compare the West Coast offense with the Sam Rutigliano offense that Brian Sipe led? I ask because over my 48 years watching the Browns, I felt that offense was incredibly dynamic and threatening. Sipe was Colt McCoy's height and didn't have a rocket arm.

I've long given up finding a version of beef Wellington, a dish that at one time deserved its "classic" stature. The version at Chez, however, was given "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" treatment on Food Network, and those kudos are well deserved.

The 0.7 percent rise in nonresidential building left the sector at an all-time high of $428.2 billion at an annual rate, following a 0.4 percent drop in October.

I oppose this anti-collective bargaining legislation because I believe it will give employers a huge upper hand on implementing work practices that give way to at-will employees being treated unfairly when it comes to pay, hiring and firing, and treatment in the workplace.

Don't be alarmed. For the record, our family room has not been freshly painted, nor do I have gnome-like friends. These were just snippets from two recent dreams, selections from my own somnolenscent cinema. Though my sleep rhythms were off kilter this week due to a nasty virus, these vivid visions are just part of my regular dream routine. Sometimes they are intensely vivid projections of fears and anxieties, while other times they are pure slapstick. For example, there was the dream a couple of years ago where I dreamt I had invented a computer printer that could print photographs on tomatoes. "Think of the possibilities," I said to my kids the next morning. "Printable tomatoes! You could serve salads to your friends with your pictures on them." Apparently I was the only one who saw that as a vision. Email me if you want more details, as I want to protect my patent rights. I think my children are still laughing about it.

His American Jobs Act -- combining minimal ambition and minimal creativity -- was greeted with bipartisan skepticism. Obama has repeatedly demanded that Congress "act now." In response, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has effectively told the president to get in line for the Senate's "next work period" in October.

Freshman Williams is the likely replacement in the starting lineup. The coaches will speak with players soon to wrap up the year and a transfer for some reserve is a possibility. But don't expect the Buckeyes to add any junior college players, and grabbing a recruit at this stage of the game -- though they remain in on highly-rated big man Tony Parker -- isn't a strong bet. So working with 11 scholarship players next season, instead of the maximum 13, looks like the plan, with the roster dropping to 10 if someone else leaves.

Meadows Depot is a homespun, grass-roots operation, a nonprofit that's long on heart and short on sophistication.

That hardly affects two other endearing appetizers. A pile of crisp, skinny, truffle-inflected frites can be enriched with a burst of crabmeat, sweet against salty, cold against hot, pillowy against crunchy. Lobster bisque, too often swamped in the Northwest by tidal waves of clam chowder, is an outburst of creaminess punctuated by dabs of lobster meat. It also holds up well against the restaurant's own clam chowder, dauntingly rich even before being bafflingly spiked with olive oil.

The other factor these lawmakers - and many citizens - seem to ignore is the reality of the classroom setting. As a teacher, you're not only teaching, but you're also managing a classroom of about 25 energetic kids who have a variety of learning needs, skill levels, home lives and personalities. And let's remember that not every child is angelic, respectful and attentive, either. Teaching math while managing the short attention spans and behavior issues of all these children simultaneously is truly an art form.

Previously, Greece, Portugal and Ireland succumbed to similar predicaments. After interest rates soared on their bonds, they had to be rescued by loans from other European countries, the European Central Bank and the IMF. The trouble is that Spain's economy is twice as big as Greece's, Ireland's and Portugal's combined. And financially precarious Italy has an economy that's 50 percent larger than Spain's. Is there enough money to bail out these countries?
