Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski and Washington Gov. Chris Gregoire, both Democrats, appeared with Chu to announce the tentative agreement Tuesday. Kulongoski said afterward that it gives Oregon more input at Hanford and puts tank waste cleanup "on a realistic time frame" given the technical challenges.
When I walked into Divas (divassf.com), I had a vague idea of what to expect. I mean, it's a tranny bar that's been around for a while, so I figured it would be rough around the edges, packed with trans girls and the guys that chase them. Being a San Francisco girl, I've had many a t-girl gal-pal mention her time at Divas or, before that, the Motherlode, the now-shuttered Post Street reform-school-for-girls that many surviving trannies might prefer to forget. By all accounts, it was a rough place, blending in quite well with the commerce of the neighborhood.

Affton tied it at 18, but a Beauchamp kill and two Affton hitting errors gave Lindbergh a 21-18 lead. A lift call against the Flyers followed by a Benedict block allowed Affton to cut it to 24-23, before Jameson Stanton finished the game with a kill for Lindbergh.
Unless the Lakers also complete a trade involving point guards Derek Fisher or Steve Blake, the addition of Sessions would create a logjam at the position. Sessions has one more year remaining on his contract for $4.55 million, though he can opt out.

Generalao will oversee a wide selection of sake.
Throughout, she and her assistants offer gentle instruction — how a damp dishcloth under a cutting board stabilizes it when chopping herbs, why a shallow and wide soup pot is better than a tall and narrow one, why slab bacon is better, why you should dilute your olive oil with canola oil when sautéing vegetables and always heat the pan in advance, how tilting your just-baked bread atop a wooden spoon is a good substitute for a baking rack.
The Grand Marshall of the 2010 parade was 43-year veteran Don Tracy, who has been captain, lieutenant, secretary and treasurer of the Hose Company during his tenure.

He did not accompany the team to San Antonio last Sunday when the effort put forth in a 114-98 loss to the Spurs earned praise from Scott. The coach was sincere as he congratulated his players for just playing hard.

I happen to think Palin's position on abortion stinks. But abortion and your list of other feminist concerns don't come close to capturing all of the issues I care about most -- not by a long shot.
Among the most regularly offered are the global and regional passes offered year-round by airline groups such as Oneworld, Star Alliance and SkyTeam. These tend to be good for up to a year of travel and cover more of the globe than JetBlue's pass. But you may need to identify your destinations upfront before you leave, and although cheaper perhaps than booking individual flights, they're not cheap. Pricing is generally based on where you bought the pass, seat class, number of continents visited and miles flown. The one-world fares, for example, start at $3,499 for three continents (before taxes, fees and surcharges) for a pass bought in the United States (for the same pass, prices start at $3,000 if bought in Venezuela).
Didn't Oprah just have a show with news stories from the 80's, in which she interviewed the husband of Susan Smith who drowned her 2 boys, but claimed they were car jacked ? People lie. BIG LIES. Philip Markoff is on suicide watch right now. If you were innocent would suicide be your first thought, or would making sure you were able to prove to the world that you were NOT guilty be your main goal?
Desserts? How about enough intensely flavored raspberry sorbet to feed a family of four. Our other dessert was a warm chocolate cobbler. What words in that last sentence would dare make you think this was less than a home run? "Chocolate" plus "warm" equals melt-in-your-mouth.
A group of small soaps ($12 each; fresh.com) in Bergamot Citrus, Coriander Lavender or Gardenia Magnolia, are more use to a host than one large bar of soap.
The UFW is the linchpin of the Farm Worker Movement, a network of a dozen tax-exempt organizations that do business with one another, enrich friends and family, and focus on projects far from the fields: They build affordable housing in San Francisco and Albuquerque, own a top-ranked radio station in Phoenix, run a political campaign in support of an Indian casino and lobby for gay marriage.

The Rangers’ literal strength in puck battles was one of their singular team strengths during the season.

Once you get beyond Sunday's episode of "NYC 22," which fits into what I like to call the "recited resume" category of show premieres, the actual plot situations are adequate, although it doesn't help that some events are baldly predictable. But even when the events somewhat catch our interest, we're left unfulfilled because of how one-dimensional the characters are. And that's a fundamental problem with the script. Yes, the dialogue itself is often terrific - Price has always had a great sense of how real people speak - but, again, it can't hide the fact that the characters themselves are never fleshed out.
A 59-year-old Powell Butte woman died this morning after losing control of her car on an icy stretch of Highway 22 near Santiam Pass and colliding nearly head-on with an unloaded log truck, according to Oregon State Police.

The prime real estate in the historic Fairmount neighborhood immediately attracted a lot of attention. "There was a big fight to save it and that's why it is what it is today," Elk said. "This was one of the first neighborhoods to be gentrified from the city ring. It would have cost a lot of money to demolish it. There were proposals but every one required some demolition, but it became a national historic landmark." The City of Philadelphia owns the site and public money was initially applied to the project for roofing work and to gain a certificate of occupancy for public safety.

— In the '50s and '60s, amphetamines became popular drugs because they boost metabolism and suppress appetite. But the pills proved to be highly addictive, and doctors discovered they increase blood pressure and heart rate. The amphetamine phentermine is approved for short-term weight loss, usually less than 12 weeks, though it is seldom prescribed because of the potential for addiction.
The problem is that Anderson, caked in white "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?" makeup, manages to make Miss Havisham silly, and that's the last thing the character should be. Why? Because silly is neither scary nor sad. When Pip is first brought to Satis House and later lays eyes on the decay of the unattended wedding feast of years before, and when the ghostlike image of Miss Havisham descends from the second floor to greet him, he doesn't seem even slightly afraid or nervous. And why should he be? There's nothing scary about Miss Havisham, and, to a young boy used to a simple rural life, there should be.

The scalp that matters belongs first, second and third to Jerry Sandusky, Paterno's former defensive coordinator now facing multiple charges of sexual abuse with eight different boys over 15 years.

The couple called DPW, which came and opened manhole covers until it found the source, Smith said. She said the source of the problem was the same manhole cover where DPW were working when the Sudols had their sewage mess in 2009 — a mess she said she would have also experienced had her husband not installed a backflow valve after the 2004 incident.
So we have a problem with that of how to make the working capital regular -- always on an incoming basis versus waiting for the 90-day payday. Because the 90-day payday just puts you out for another four weeks and then you have to do it again and again. Those are issues that I think most of the fabricators here, or manufacturers, or even construction personnel have issues with. That's one problem.

That's six Saturdays when OSU fans should wake up a bit on edge, not knowing how the day will end. Exciting.

When it comes to orderly storage for the gear and belongings of multiple team members, my money's on individual rolling duffels. If each child has his or her own, it's easier to transport gear, shower supplies and uniforms between the school bus or van and the host school's locker room. Corral the clutter and keep it from walking away.
The council decision, on a 4-1 vote, was extraordinary on several fronts: 1) the home might be the most architecturally important structure in the city; 2) the council's action was prompted by citizen outcry as opposed to city staff's concerns; 3) the owners had a building permit; 4) the emergency action itself required a supermajority of the council to overcome legal hurdles.
Ready is a reflection of the anger over illegal immigration in Arizona. Gov. Jan Brewer signed a controversial new immigration law in April, which requires police, while enforcing other laws, to question a person's immigration status if officers have a reasonable suspicion that the person is in the country illegally.

The team practices twice a week, usually for two hours a night, and plays games on weekends. Players are paid by the game -- meaning Carter is also trying to line up sponsors to provide some financial stability. The win against the Vipers should help, the coach/owner said, though the team dropped its next two games and is now 1-5 heading into its April 21 game at Evansville.
The Cardinals had two close calls go against them Saturday at Busch Stadium, but it was the things they failed to do around those pivotal moments that decided the game, not a couple of gestures from the umpires.
"That's a level of outside influence we've never seen before," said Mike McCabe, executive director of the government-watchdog group Wisconsin Democracy Campaign. "He's been all over the country raising money."
Soon afterward, the California Supreme Court deemed the couple’s nuptials invalid. So when Denelsbeck and Javins moved to New Jersey from Brooklyn three years later, they entered into a civil union, which grants the same rights and protections as marriage, only without the title. It wasn’t as romantic as that day at San Francisco’s city hall, but finally gaining recognition of their relationship overshadowed the shock that would come later.

Carr was primarily responsible for the recruitment and development of the Scarlet Knights last two NBA draft picks — Quincy Douby in 2006 and Hamady Ndiaye in 2010.

On a few topics, they are more or less unanimous (dimmer switches, natural colors for expensive-to-replace items like countertops or tiles) and on others, there are varying opinions (green or peach for a bedroom? is an open floor plan a pleasure or a pain?).

There are a lot of high school athletes, very elite swimmers, that choose not to do it so as not to interfere with training, but it's not as much for myself as it is for the team and school.

You're swimming for other people. You learn so much more.

House Bill 3241 had a ton of bipartisan support.

Analysts almost never said to sell specific companies, because that would alienate those firms, which then might move business for bond offerings, equity deals, acquisitions, buybacks or other activity away from the analyst's brokerage firm.

The high-low hemline emerged a clear favorite this season at David's Bridal dress shops across the state, as well as at the Windsor at the Glendale (Calif.) Galleria and Unique Vintage, a small boutique in Burbank, Calif. - Windsor's buyer Blanca Farber called it the biggest prom trend in California.

“A key driver behind the increased share buyback and larger dividend is that IBM’s software growth continues to grow at or above market,” Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in San Francisco with an overweight rating on the stock, said today in a note to clients. “Today’s news signals no pullback in its shareholder-friendly focus.”

Perhaps the most extreme of Crews' scenarios unfurled in "Car" (1972), in which the son of a junkyard owner eats an old Ford Maverick chunk by chunk, in the process becoming a spectacle on national television.

But Romney's choice of the modestly priced jeans make a statement that every man - and his significant other - can relate to.
One of those opportunities was with Chris Getz at the plate. Yost put a safety squeeze on and Getz bunted the ball foul down the first base line. A safety squeeze requires a better bunt than a suicide. The runner waits to see that the bunt is good enough before breaking for home. On a suicide if the ball gets down anywhere the runner will probably be safe. The situation was first and third with one down and Ned may have been trying to avoid yet another double play  although Getz is pretty hard to double up.
Excerpt: Although Blazers executives would not say this is the end of the Oden era, the chances Oden plays again in Portland, or anywhere in the NBA, are doubtful at best. Of his five knee surgeries, three of them have been microfracture procedures, including Monday's surgery in Vail, Colo. Microfracture is the most invasive and serious of knee procedures, and involves making tiny fractures in the knee bone to generate bleeding and stimulate new cartilage growth. No NBA player has come back to play after undergoing three microfracture surgeries.

For "Star Trek" fans like Moore, conventions are a Disneyland of celebrities, merchandise, trivia and all things intergalactic. It’s a chance to see familiar faces (often painted and plastered over with elaborate makeup) and to reveal one’s true colors, sometimes the green of a Gorn or the brown of a Klingon.
Le: There's a lot of work about how parents have interacted with their young children. The attachment style is ingrained in the child and can be carried on to romantic partners. If the parent was not consistently nurturing or there for the child, the child will have expectations that their partner can't be relied upon. Studies show people will choose dissatisfaction if it's consistent with their expectations, versus things that make them change the way they see the world.

Given how incremental change can get overlooked until you suddenly understand there has been a revolution, Auburn's involving play is a very useful and potent reminder of how much things have changed for the better, and how the need to hide an aspect of themselves undermined so many brilliant political men of not so long ago. That category certainly included Alsop, who wrote for a time alongside his less testy and more cautious brother Stewart (warmly played by Boyd Gaines), whom Auburn treats as a wise, see-all-sides adviser who didn't quite know what to do with brother's polemical sharp edges.

That message was driven home in spectacular fashion on Tuesday by Apple, America’s most valuable company. While the mainstream media was whipping up a frenzy over the labor practices at Apple’s outsourcing company Foxconn, Chinese consumers were buying up iPhones and iPads with abandon.

The fairy-tale heroine has been a touchstone of Oates since childhood, when her grandmother, Blanche, gave her a brand-new edition of “Wonderland” and “Through the Looking-Glass” as a Christmas present. For the shy, intellectually “I love both novels,” she says. “They go between scenes of childlike adventure and scenes of nightmare. They skirt on the very edge of being terrifying. All these things are almost like nightmares but they’re not completely horrific. And at the end of each novel, she wakes up.”

The bill would require the three tax agencies to develop a single Web portal to file, pay, check due dates, claim refunds and seek information.

Earlier that same day we had stood in triumph on top of Mt. Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States. The weather was glorious, and the view was stunning.

If you’re outraged by Swiss authorities, who had Polanski arrested while on his way to a film festival even though he’s maintained a home in the country for years, boycott cuckoo clocks. Call the Los Angeles prosecutor’s office and tell them the state has bigger fish to fry.

Davis' execution had been halted three times since 2007. The U.S. Supreme Court even gave Davis an unusual opportunity to prove his innocence in a lower court last year. While the nation's top court didn't hear the case, they did set a tough standard for Davis to exonerate himself, ruling that his attorneys must "clearly establish" Davis' innocence — a higher bar to meet than prosecutors having to prove guilt. After the hearing, a lower court judge ruled in prosecutors' favor, and the justices didn't take up the case.
Collins knew a potential calamity when he saw one. He took one look at my lack of grace and grabbed my hand, announcing, "Never fear, my lady, I will be your guide and your life saver today!"
He said the fact he played in a pro-style offense compensates for the fact he started only 19 games at quarterback. Tannehill was athletic enough to switch to receiver as a redshirt freshman in 2008, leading the Aggies in receiving (55 catches for 844 and five touchdowns in six starts) and earning Offensive MVP honors. He led the Aggies in receiving again in 2009 and then split time between receiver and quarterback in 2010, starting he final six games at quarterback.
Florida, Georgia and Illinois are among the states hardest hit by bank collapses, stemming from the meltdown in the real estate market that brought an avalanche of soured mortgage loans.

And it's not because the Hancock administration makes a compelling case to move the National Western Stock Show out of the urban core, where it's been for 106 years. They haven't. As a matter of fact, there's been radio silence since December, when Mayor Michael Hancock fired his working group and directed the Denver Urban Renewal Authority (DURA) to evaluate the stock show's business and facilities plan.

In that case, the drugs inhibited the degradation of proteins rather than inducing protein degradation.

Expounding on Frank Cimo's astute summary of the President's Council on Jobs and Competiveness report, I would like to convey my thoughts: I researched that report for accuracy and indeed Mr. Cimo was correct. The President's hand-picked, non-partisan Council made up of members appointed by Mr. Obama from among distinguished citizens outside the Federal Government actually did recommend increasing production of American fossil fuels and champion corporate tax reform in a recent statement, only for it to fall on deaf ears. I also concur that we need to "optimize all of our natural resources and construct pathways (pipelines, transmission and distribution) to deliver electricity and fuel and not allow 'obstacles' that could threaten the development of some energy projects, weaken our energy infrastructure while negatively impacting jobs."

Moreover, The Plain Dealer is dead wrong in its proclamation that currently the balance is "tipped in favor of unions." Any member of any negotiating team -- on either side -- can attest to that. When you look at the statistics on binding arbitration, you see unions winning almost half and employers winning a little more than half of the disputes that go to arbitration. The work of the state and its cities has been uninterrupted by strikes -- which were numerous before we had collective bargaining. And why were there so many strikes before collective bargaining? They were the spilling-over of pent-up frustration at an unfair, one-sided system.

The Latter-day Saints have been running a multimillion-dollar series of ads, called "I'm a Mormon," since 2010, to dispel stereotypes by telling the stories of individual Mormons. To avoid any appearance that the ads were meant to help Romney, the church didn't buy ad time in Iowa and some other markets with early primaries, said Michael Purdy, an LDS national spokesman. At the General Conference last month, led by the highest authorities of the church, there was no mention of the election across the pulpit.

For our final nights in Bath, we had splurged by booking a room at the elegant Priory Hotel. But as we approached the city, we found ourselves dawdling. In hours of walking each day, we had gotten to know the countryside intimately.
