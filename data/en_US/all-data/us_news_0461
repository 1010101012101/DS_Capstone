That’s all the Giants have to show for playoff appearances since winning the franchise’s third Super Bowl. And while such a “drought” can be tempered by the fact that quarterback Eli Manning, defensive end Justin Tuck and a host of holdovers remember the good times, it shouldn’t be forgotten that a significant portion of the roster hasn’t been able to experience what the playoffs feel like firsthand. The revved-up intensity; the spotlight; the emotion. That group includes 21 players who have entered the league over the past three years — and the entire wide receiving corps.

Since the late John T. Corrigan first won it in 1956, the job has turned over only twice, both times on a vote of Democratic Party insiders. The late Stephanie Tubbs Jones replaced an ailing Corrigan in 1991. When she moved on to Congress in 1998, party leaders picked Bill Mason. That meant that the first time both Tubbs Jones and Mason faced the electorate, they were incumbents with all of the power and advantages that implies.

She wrote a column for a British magazine before covering the 2008 Democratic and Republican national conventions as a correspondent for Seventeen magazine. She worked the presidential inauguration for Nickelodeon, and was on the red carpet at the Oscars for the "E!" network.

Yes, sadly, some people in Orange County are more likely to be the targets of hate crimes than others. This year's hate crimes report stresses the fact that blacks were the most frequent targets, with 19 hate crimes directed against them in 2006.

OBAMA: "Yes. I have been a long-time advocate for public financing of campaigns combined with free television and radio time as a way to reduce the influence of moneyed special interests...In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election.

In the great majority of instances, Sunshine Laws are the only tool that citizens have to make sure their officials act the public's interest.

These fiscal motivations have coincided with consumer demand for more attractive options. Much of the push for improvements comes not from current residents, members of a do-it-yourself generation who often hold modest expectations, but from demanding baby boomers who want better accommodations for their parents -- and, in the future, themselves. NRC's management talks to residents and their children, and "listens to what they want," said CEO Kyle Nordine. Ecumen's board, said Ordahl, "looked into the crystal ball and said, 'Really, do any of us want to live in a nursing home the way they're currently configured?'"
The new contract provides for police to receive the annual 2% raise retroactively to the beginning of the new four-year agreement, Jan. 1, 2011, and adds two years to the salary guide. That means that it will take newly hired officers 10 years rather than eight to reach the highest pay rate. Under the new contract that rate is about $101,000, Russo said.

The big reveal of "Then Again" (besides Keaton's claim that Allen had a beautiful body) is that for many years Keaton was bulimic, excusing herself from real life to soothe herself with prodigious amounts of food (lovingly cataloged in detail only a true addict could muster after all these years) of which she then rid herself. The confession is not particularly surprising — Actress has issue with weight/food! Details at 11! — but the aplomb with which she handles it most certainly is. She discusses it in the middle of the book, refuses to offer armchair diagnosis or blame, and then she moves on. She doesn't use it as a symbol for her life or spine for her narrative; she doesn't use anything as a spine for her narrative. In fact, while reading "Then Again, " one would do well to remember Keaton's love of photography — she has curated several collections and learned, from her mother, the art of collage. "Then Again" often feels like a collage, or a collection, of moments and thoughts and images, that stay with you longer than you suppose they might because they are so often contradictory and unsettling.
The sensitivity is understandable. Many Cuban-Americans — including many in the baseball world — risked their lives to flee the island, with vivid memories of escaping the regime on makeshift rafts, leaving everything behind and arriving in the U.S. penniless. Well aware of this, the Marlins sprung into damage-control mode, trying to prevent a plunge in ticket sales and to limit the political fallout, given that Cuban-American taxpayers helped fund the new stadium.
But we balance that against the conviction that there is something totalitarian in the idea that the state can force a woman to bear a child that she, for whatever reason -- incest, rape, illness, deformity or grinding poverty -- does not wish to bear.

After living in their daughter’s house for approximately seven years, Mr. Traister had significant health problems and was eventually admitted into a nursing home facility in August 2009. As part of a Medicaid estate strategy designed to protect their assets, Mrs. Traister, the healthier spouse, purchased a life estate interest in their daughter’s home for the sum of $498,500.00. The Contract and Deed required for this life estate transaction were also executed in August 2009, although the court did point out that the Deed was not filed with the clerk’s office until more than 14 months later in November 2010. New Jersey denied Medicaid on the basis that Mr. and Mrs. Traister had gifted $498,500 to their daughter and son-in-law. Although the parents had been living in the daughter’s house for over seven years, nevertheless, New Jersey took the position that the one year residency requirement must be met before the applicant applies for Medicaid. In this case, the life estate transaction did not take place until August 2009. This was only one month before the application for Medicaid assistance was filed with New Jersey. Rather than proceed through the state courts, Mr. Traister filed a lawsuit against New Jersey in the Federal District Court for the District of New Jersey. Mr. Traister filed a petition for a preliminary injunction seeking to prevent New Jersey from treating the August 2009 asset transfer as a “gift.” The Federal District Court denied his application for the preliminary injunction.
So you wanted a wide receiver? You got a wide receiver. His name is Brian Quick, and it hardly matters that the casual Rams fan has no idea who he is. Fisher and Snead are convinced that they found the new secret weapon for quarterback Sam Bradford, and they firmly believe the wide receiver from Appalachian State will turn out to be a ball-gobbling, touchdown-producing big target that will make everyone forget about Justin Blackmon and Michael Floyd.

Another safeguard should be that if a teacher received enough negative evaluations to trigger the student comments to be used in evaluations, the teacher should be notified. Only if after another school year in which the teacher again received negative evaluations after being put on notice should the student comments weigh on the teacher's job security.
However, five states offer fully equal marriage rights for same-sex couples: Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. The District of Columbia also allows same-sex marriage.
But many teachers along with their statewide union, the Florida Education Assn., are opposed. They say the law will be expensive, will rely on an unproven system and won't fairly evaluate teacher performance. The union has threatened to sue, arguing the plan tramples on teachers' rights to collective bargaining on salaries and work conditions, among other issues.
Analysts from Standard & Poor’s called the revenue estimates "optimistic" in a critical report released days after the governor unveiled his $32.1 billion budget last month.

To the cancer comedy subgenre we can add a new category: the colonoscopy rom-com, not likely to metastasize beyond "A Little Bit of Heaven." What Gael García Bernal, Kathy Bates, Treat Williams and Peter Dinklage saw in the material, one can only guess. But for leading lady Kate Hudson, the ill-conceived, blandly executed production is the latest in a long line of disappointing career choices, leaving fans of her eye-opening turn in "Almost Famous" still waiting for another role to showcase her range.

If Manning remains healthy, Osweiler has an ideal profile for a developmental quarterback.

When adding an equity position, my preference is to buy a basket of the underlying stocks themselves rather than a fund or ETF, which not only saves on management fees but also permits more portfolio flexibility by allowing you to focus on the best performing names.

However, the limoncello ice cream soda with berry puree and biscotti made for a refreshing ending.

And then there is the Virginia ultrasound bill, otherwise known as the "state-sanctioned rape" act, if abortion-rights activists and their legislative surrogates are to be believed. Here again, mainstream media reports have depicted American women as universally horrified at the prospect of a law that would require a woman to undergo an ultrasound before consenting to the destruction of her unborn child. Never mind that the use of both abdominal and vaginal ultrasounds is standard practice in abortion clinics. Or that the same reporters and commentators who cannot repeat the "abortion is murder" slogan without snickering now are passing along the "ultrasound is rape" argument as self-evident truth. The point is that there is one acceptable opinion for women to hold on issues like abortion and those who dissent from it do not deserve a hearing.

Meanwhile, the testimony from Brokos seemed to mostly lay the foundation for the detailed case the government is meticulously unwrapping against Bergrin: Namely, that the former federal prosecutor and son of a Brooklyn cop became a dangerous defense lawyer who orchestrated the execution of McCray to shield himself from being fingered as a cocaine supplier to a Newark drug-running gang — and so a drug-dealer client of his, William Baskerville, who was associated with the same gang, could beat criminal narcotics charges.

If China won't revalue, the alternative is retaliation. This might start a trade war, because China might respond in kind, perhaps buying fewer Boeings and more Airbuses and substituting Brazilian soybeans for American. One proposal by Reps. Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio, and Tim Murphy, Republican of Pennsylvania, would classify currency manipulation -- which China clearly practices -- as an export subsidy eligible for "countervailing duties" (tariffs offsetting the subsidy). This makes economic sense but might be ruled illegal by the World Trade Organization. A House committee last week approved this approach; the full House could pass it this week. Ideally, congressional action would convince China to negotiate a significant RMB revaluation.

The truth is that Sarkozy, 57, has never succeeded in shaking off the negative impression he made at the beginning of his five-year term, that the conservative leader was the "president of the rich."

But in heavier use, including lots of email usage and Web browsing, streaming a one-hour TV show via Netflix, and conducting an hour-long phone call, the battery drained more quickly and was almost gone by late in the afternoon.

The infinite had been a part of the sales pitch for Los Angeles for a long time: in its light, its deserts, its emptiness and its place at the end of roads leading west.

But according to Johnson, Wallace provides far more to the team than mere statistics. The coach said Wallace will sometimes ask, during a timeout, to address the team about offensive or defensive responsibilities. Johnson said he welcomes that kind of initiative from the 29-year-old veteran.

No matter how you break down the numbers, the Affordable Care Act has built upon the strengths of the American health care system. While patients are busy taking charge of their care, the Michigan Legislature is missing an opportunity to grab the reins and tailor the state Health Insurance Exchange to the needs of its citizens. Instead of taking advantage of almost $11 million in grants to plan and establish the exchange, my GOP friends are holding their breath hoping they won't have to implement the exchange for the people of our great state. While they are crossing their fingers, other states are busy putting the needs of their citizens first so they will be ready to go in 2014 when these exchanges will be fully functional. If our Michigan Legislature does not move forward with setting up the exchange, then the federal government will do so for them.

Buffalo carpaccio ($15) stands out not only for its unlikely flavor profile but also for its beauty. Paper-thin slices of meat act as a mat for three fried oysters and tasso aioli with a cap of green and red spinach chiffonade. The lushness of the meat, the briny crispness of the oysters and the earthy flavor of the ham work to create a dish that plays successfully off the theme of surf-and-turf.

If they can continue to improve that record -- if they can overcome Verlander at least a few times a season -- perhaps that will verify that Hosmer and Moustakas have completed a corps of young players who will soon make the Royals an annual part of the race in the AL Central.
By the time the Berkshire Mountains got a confectioners' sugar frosting of snow in mid-December, I was ready to walk into a print by Currier & Ives, which isn't a far-fetched notion in western Massachusetts. Back roads cross rivers on covered bridges, mosey past red barns and lead, inevitably, to country inns where I was always tempted to check in on the spur of the moment. I drove around in an old Subaru station wagon, listening to James Taylor, with an overnight bag packed and ready on the back seat just in case I find a picture-perfect inn and decide to bed down for the night.
Just as I pushed myself to new feats of endurance, I also found new and better ways to recover and relax. The muscles in my legs, back and shoulders have been much happier ever since I discovered these two programs:

Decorative pillows, lamps and throws can add class to a room. “A cashmere throw on the end of a bed or over a chair adds the finishing touch to the bedroom. Because it’s something that, if you don’t want to get in bed, you can go in and at least cuddle up with that.”

It isn't just the institutions, either. The individual American investor, who has been selling stocks for most of the past couple of years, has suddenly turned tail and started buying again. Portfolio managers will tell you their clients have been back on the phone since the start of the year, eager to get in on the action. The Investment Company Institute, a trade organization for mutual funds, reports big inflows of new money into stock-market funds since early January. Indeed, inflows into U.S. stock funds have been running at levels not seen—but for a single brief spike in 2009—since well before the crash.

It sliced about $7.5 million this school year.
Once again, running back Lache Seastrunk made noise with his feet. Showing the darting ability of Jacquizz Rodgers but with more size, Seastrunk wowed for the second straight day. He’s the rare running back who can not only stop on a dime but throw it into reverse without grinding any gears.

He opened the game with two catches for 48 yards and finished with a game-high 130 receiving yards. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers cooled off considerably, especially after torching the Atlanta Falcons the week before. He finished 17-for-30 passing for 244 yards but was intercepted twice and didn't throw a touchdown. Rodgers, though, consistently connected with Jennings enough to keep drives alive, and he picked his spots to run well, finishing with 39 rushing yards, including the game's opening touchdown.

WR Mario Manningham. The taunting penalty was a big, big mental mistake. And yes, it probably sort of wound up helping the Giants because it helped the Pats take the lead more quickly, thus giving the Giants more time to come back. But you can’t make that mistake. That being said, that was a well-run route for the TD by Manningham, who said he “stacked” CB Kyle Arrington. What that means is he got past him and then back on top of him to shield him from making a play. Manningham has struggled with that in the past. He executed perfectly there to give himself a better angle on the ball.

øThis is a team that looks like something is wrong, and no one is quite sure what it is. Whenever that is the case, the coach usually pays the price. That's never a painless solution, but it is even more difficult in Buffalo's case because Lindy Ruff is the NHL seniority leader among coaches. He and Regier have been together a long time. A decision to fire Ruff probably would have to be the most difficult hockey decision Regier ever would consider.

They're much, much larger than that now, e-mailed the Road Rant commuter. (Think buckets of baseballs.) The ever-expanding craters force drivers to swerve like a base runner trying to avoid a tag.

Industry leaders, on the other hand, say the drilling involves proven technology with adequate safety measures. Accessing that huge store is a tempting prospect; while most Americans are convinced that developing alternative and sustainable energy supplies is essential, getting there from here will necessitate an array of traditional energy sources as a bridge. Cleaner than petroleum, natural gas could be a part of that bridge. However, its procurement cannot be at the cost of safety, well-being and drinking water.

Fannie and Freddie buy mortgages originated by banks, then bundle them for sale to investors as bonds.

“We’ve never looked at (this) game in any other way than it’s an experience for the kids,” he said. “None of them will probably ever get to play (in a Major League game) and it’s all about the experience.

Dan: In the Page Avenue extension construction zone, it was a very good idea to add that "turnaround" just east of Central School Road. However, is it too late (or simply impossible) to move/add the same thing just east of where the old Harvest intersection was?
