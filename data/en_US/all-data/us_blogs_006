The worst defense you can offer for trying first-person fiction based on reality is, "But it really happened." So what?
All I ask is that every medical report have a uniform heading, with spaces for the patient’s name, birthdate, and a date for the document which should default to the date of service. Other useful pieces of information (for which space could be allocated, even if left blank when unnecessary — like an insurance claim form) could include the physician, the medical record number (used mainly for institutions), location, procedure, etc. It would be nice if the body of the reports followed suit, but I have no problem leaving it with one large content field. Tables for lab results would be nice. Once you design it for paper, frankly it becomes child’s play to adapt it for electronic use, which would be a giant step towards a universal EMR.
Speaker 7 is out of her beautiful, goddamned mind – as the anonymous, Samantha Brick “Oh I’m so pretty, so Speaker 7 did me a favor and threw a bag over my head” photo should indicate. 7 has chosen the photo of this self-proclaimed beautiful narcissist posed next to a bag of colon cleansing doggie treats as a stand-in for her own photo. Never mind, that the bag says “coprophagia” on it, which I believe means a dog eats their own poo. I respect this choice. Truth is, I respect everything Speaker 7 writes.
When I saw this guy I stopped for a few minutes…various things came to mind. Afterwards, I couldn’t get this scene out of my head. He did this thing with these glass balls, allowing them to almost seamlessly slide around his hands and arms. At the time my friends told me the name of this art form, but now for the life of me I can’t remember what it’s called (never fails, eh!)
http://alethonews.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/top-israeli-archaeologists-contest-jewish-ties-to-jerusalem/ You won’t hear about this on MSM. After over 2 years of digging, noted Israeli archaeologists have stated that they can find no archaeological evidence to prove that Solomon’s Temple even existed! This follows on the heels of a stunning announcement by eminent Egyptologist Zahi Awas earlier this year in which he stated that, based on the evidence, the exodus of Jewish belief did not happen…. at least not in the way portrayed in the Tanakh or Bible. The timing of such announcements is never coincidental.

May 1-7: A time of review especially regarding your unconscious bids for power. Watch Martyrdom and watch for irritability and crankiness in yourself and others as you face certain truths and realities. Don’t get stuck. Remember to engage the moving center regularly as that will keep things flowing. The key is to be proactive, make adjustments, choose or eliminate, clean something out to make room for something new. Especially watch self-judgment. Keep the mantra that “it is all good”.
That night was unexpected and unplanned. After Marianna convinced Isabel to give the guys a chance, the girls rode around for a couple of hours in that Trans Am with Roger and Randy. In the celebration of Marianna’s graduation, the girls had already had a shot of moonshine. This caused Marianna to be a complete lousy Lucy. It wasn’t a big deal for Marianna to meet and greet strangers. And even though the moonshine was 110 proof, Isabel’s morals were in tact. However, while driving around Fort county and seeing the sites as a light snow fell, they began drinking vodka and orange juice. Unforeseen by the girls, youth and stupidity go hand in hand, and they got drunk quickly. They all ended up at the only hotel in Poverty, Traveler’s Lodge.

Paul claims to have been educated by Gamaliel, one of the premier teachers of the Law in the first century. Gamaliel taught between A.D. 22-55, giving us an approximate early date for Paul’s education. If Paul began study at the latest age of 16, we can guess a birth year of about 6 at the earliest. Polhill observes that several rulings of Gamaliel appear in the Mishnah, mostly having to do with marriage and divorce. Perhaps Gamiliel’s views influenced Paul’s personal comments on marriage in 1 Corinthians 7 (Polhill, Paul and his Letters, 30).

It all started after dinner the night of June 28th. The contractions began steady, but not painful. I had had a few false starts over the past few weeks, but this felt different. I decided to just let them happen, keep watch, and get a little sleep just in case this really was it.

The problem I have with these presenters, is that they do this all the time, -- with every episode! In every single episode the Whiteman’s reputation, culture and heritage is thrashed to hell. How many viewers are getting the general impression that the Whiteman (Dutch, English or Norwegian), where the scum of the earth? Surely they must realise that many schools in this country will be using this programme for educational purposes! In the end this programme, and many others like it, will cause more harm than good by generating more feelings of racial tension and ultimate hatred towards the ever-dwindling White Race living on the southern tip of Africa.

It's not that she equates non-consensual penetration with consensual intercourse. It's not that she dismisses the concerns of women who don't wish to be poked and prodded unnecessarily with a slut-shaming "hey, they ought to be used to having stuff jammed inside 'em." We've come to expect that sort of casual horror from people like her.
Yes, I have made several changes to my lifestyle this year. I have given up habits I was never really too proud of having, I am focused on being a better person. But, the tears that I cried for the whole first hour of my birthday, I realize it’s less the things I did to celebrate, but more the people I celebrated with that I miss so much.
I love a good quest and I’m not bashing it as a story form, but let’s be honest: plotting a quest is relatively easy. The characters must make a journey. Once you’ve decided where they start and where they finish, constructing a plot is basically a process of inventing interesting obstacles and sticking them in the way of the characters. In a fantasy world (as a youngster, I wrote fantasy) you have a whole exciting array of potential obstacles that can be thrown at hapless questers: dragons, monsters, orcs, Evil Dark Lords etc etc etc.

Week 3, for my Lenten Thankfulness Journal.
I remember promising myself that if I just managed to sell 5,000 copies, I would never ask for anything again, and I can safely say that it surpassed that number long ago. I mean, don't run away with the idea that The Swan Kingdom was a bestseller. Or even a big seller. It wasn't. It sold unexpectedly well, got some good reviews, and my publisher was happy about it. So was I.

Celeriac also known as 'celery root', used raw or cooked. It has a tough, furrowed, outer surface which is usually sliced off before use because it is too rough to peel. Celeriac has a celery flavour, and is often used as a flavouring in soups and stews; it can also be used on its own, usually mashed, or used in casseroles, gratins and baked dishes.

Around the time I started brewing my own stouts, ales, lagers, and "wee heavies," my father mentioned his fond memories of making root beer as a kid before World War II. During a subsequent school break, I scrounged up a few cases of empty bottles and pulled together ingredients to make an extract batch good old-fashioned American root beer with him. It was my first batch of home-brewed soda and the project taught me some early lessons in how not to work with yeast.

Incredibly, because of Christ’s death on the cross and His resurrection from the grave, our sins have been covered and made clean, and we have access to His Holy Spirit; who dwells in us to open our understanding, so that the things of God may become clear. No longer do we have to depend on another to grow in our knowledge of the things of God. We need only to ask the Almighty, and He will open our understanding and reveal to us the Truth. Because He loves, He leads and allows us to learn. All that was once hidden, has now been made plain.
Hey Friends, It has been such a busy month (April). Yesterday, Saturday the 7th is when the opening reception for our show at 2nd Helping occured. Sheila Wiley, whose art work is below, was unable to attend. She had a family emergency, I hope all is well now. The photo above is my work. The 2nd Helpings Gallery is really lovely and a great place to have a reception. They have lots of room and wonderful catering on site.

This was a super quick make using the pattern I'd already drafted for this tutorial. I was aiming for a boxy style shell top and that seems to have worked out pretty well. Except this time I drafted a facing for the neckline,which really enhances the bateau shape much more than the bias finish did on my previous make of this top. It was such a quick make that I even bothered to finish the facing with some deep purple bias from my stash...

I wasn’t sure if he was joking or not, but he pointed me in the right direction and I found a place at the end of the block.

I worship and make offerings to my gods because I believe them to be worthy of my praise, my love, my adoration. I honor them not even because they wish it, not really. I honor them because I honor who they are, what they represent, because they are worthy of my time, my work, of all I can offer and so much more. I honor them because they are a part of me.
Therefore, please consider my positivity reinstated. Game on!
Some would argue that "Scripture" is traditionally capitalized in Anglican circles when referencing it for theological method. The reason for capitalization is to differentiate the Christian canon, from other types of scripture. That would be small fry.

I have to thank Shawn at Crafty Chics Blog for her detailed instructions on putting together a diaper cake! She did a blog tutorial in July which she posted in sections over a few days. If you are interested in viewing her tutorial, be sure to start with Part One ~ Diaper Cake Getting Started. I will throw one additional little tip in to go along with Shawn's instructions. I was at home and ready to get started and I didn't have any ribbon or large enough rubberbands that would work to secure the diapers together in the larger layers. Since the rubberbands were not large enough to go around the entire bundle I just started grouping 5-6 diapers at a time around the core base that I already had placed a rubberband around by adding a new rubberband and securing it to the base by stretching the rubberband around at least one of the diapers in the exisiting core. I continued this same pattern of piecing together another 5 or 6 at a time and securing with a new rubberband. I was using the small Goody rubberbands out of the hair care aisle. I decided to use those on the diapers because I didn't have to wrap them more than once. I could just roll the diaper and slide the rubberband over it! Does that make sense to everyone the way I wrote it? I hope so...I should have taken a picture of that step to add. Once I got the enter layer complete THEN I added the decorative ribbon around the outside, but it wasn't for structure...just as a finishing touch.

I didn't want to fly across the coast for a meeting, despite the promise of celebratory cocktails with coworkers on the other side. Didn't my clients know it was MY day? Shouldn't I be excused from work on MY day?
In Don't Blame It On Me, the superficial trappings of genre cross-pollination are obvious - the Pistols' Submission re-routed through Marshall stacks. But if there's one characteristic that exemplifies the no-man's-land between punk and hard rock, it's the drumming. (If the mechanics of punk drumming make your eyes glaze over, you might want to skip ahead). Inherited from the likes of Slade, the four-on-the-floor drumbeat - in which every beat in the bar is accented by the kick drum - became a staple of Oz hard rock (check in here at around 1:55, or here at 4:13, or here whenever you damn please). At this tempo, it's usually accompanied by eighth-notes on the hi-hat - that's two hi-hat hits for each thump of the kick drum - propelling the song and, when played slightly behind the beat, making it "swing". Not here. Invader's four-on-the-floor lumbers instead of swings, delivering the sort of heavy-handed quarter-notes reserved by punk drummers for tempos of twice this speed and beyond. Ordinarily, a rhythm stripped of feel and pace is a bit like a gluten-free vegetarian pizza - what's the point? - but here it's perfect. Hey, true art ain't always pretty.

. . . we must determine whether Broadcom has stated actionable anticompetitive conduct with allegations that Qualcomm deceived relevant SDOs into adopting the UMTS standard by committing to license its WCDMA technology on FRAND terms and, later, after lock-inoccurred, demanding non-FRAND royalties. As Qualcomm is at pains to point out, no court nor agency has decided this precise question and, in that sense, our decision will break new ground. The authorities we have cited in our lengthy discussion that has preceded this point, however, decidedly favor a finding that Broadcom’s allegations, if accepted as true, describe actionable anticompetitive conduct.
I don’t own an iron (not that we could afford the energy to run one if we did), and the act of washing is a mission in itself. Get all the dirties in a laundry bag, then cover it with a waterproof bag, dinghy to a marina, get tokens, wait through both cycles, roughly fold and haul it all back to the boat without getting wet and salty again. Most of the time our clothes are hanging around the edges of the boat, airing or drying, pinched by pegs and as wrinkled as an elephant’s skin. If we manage to find something semi-clean to throw on then we’re peachy.

Basically, the original blog that caught my attention went with the idea of “the boss is always right”. This type of blog, well hell, it came off as being an advertisement for a huge jobs board. That’s part of the problem in the good old USA. We are beginning to take too much shit from people who otherwise should have their asses put in check. We all have wanted to tell the boss fall into a bag of dicks, but most will never. Most will never rock the boat. I say rock it until he/she pees their pants, terminates without prejudiced, or basically gets a clue. Management is in charge of nothing without your work product.If the new woman at the office is hot, and the boss is a guy that automatically pays her better, gives her a better cubicle, and allows her more freedoms, then yeah dumbass, he’s trying to bone her. Don’t get in the way unless you have balls of steel. Tell him to fuck himself. Tell her that he’s trying to buy her off. Cock block if she isn’t doing it already. Serves the prick right.

So, I’ve got an aching back, but I’m not sure if that’s from the exercises or just my ongoing back issue. Or both. I’ve also got some sore thighs. I know tomorrow is going to be even worse for those! But, I don’t mind the pain. I know it’s because I worked those muscles and they are letting me know. It does suck, however, when you are constantly following a toddler around the house and lifting him up. Thankfully, my little man likes to play independently and give me a break.

Some people do frown upon such behaviour unfortunately. Rigid, uptight, conservative, moralising, traditional, authoritarian types who would do well to take their heads out their own arses. And prior to meeting him, I was kind of worried that Uncle Ji would be precisely one of those types, given his persona on twitter. However after lunch, conversation and a WMPC swap, the first one in a long time, I was pleasantly surprised. And futhermore for such a strong, masculine, macho member of the male species, I have to say that Uncle Ji had pretty good hair and nails for a man. Too good really. So I'm kind of suspicious as a result. And as for what we actually talked about over a pie and a pint in The Fox and Anchor, well Uncle Ji has forbidden that I reveal too much as he is a fiercely private man. It turned out that he only really wanted to meet me to see if I could get my hands on some indigo kyanite but I didn't really have clue what dear old Uncle Ji was on about. "Vat you talkin' beta? Vord on the internets is you the man who gets things?" he exclaimed, to which I could only reply, "Well I do get food from people Uncle Ji but that's about it". So bizarre and curious goings on indeed but I was grateful for the Indian food he gave me which came in the form of an aubergine dish called 'baingan ke amchoo', some 'shahi paneer', a dahl chutney, some rice and a very unusual pigeon tikka dish.
If you recall, I was injured after completing the Army 10 Miler back in October. I had high hopes that it would be a quick recovery, but that was not the case. I ended up giving up on all running, and pretty much any other form of exercise as well. It was all just too painful. I started in with the chiropractor. I was saved by one many years ago when I was dealing with intense back pain, so I thought it would be a good idea to try it again. After many months, I am happy to say I'm back to being pain free. I still go to the chiropractor, but I'm now down to once every other week.

Spending the Christmas holidays in Beverly Hills, Casey bought a Christmas tree and set it up undecorated in his hotel room which was across the street from the Luau, a popular restaurant. Playing the lonesome cowboy, he’d sit at the bar, strike up a conversation with a gal, telling her it was his first Christmas away from home. Would she help decorate his tree? How could she refuse the love trap? He’d whisk her away and “loosen her up with champagne” as they decorated the tree. After she’d leave, Casey said he’d undecorate the tree and return to the Luau in search of other prey.

And that’s it. As I type it in English it sounds so contrived, but you have to understand that in Arabic, this is actually completely natural speech. This is just how people say “hello”, “thanks a lot”, “good luck” and “have a nice day”. Every utterance is a prayer, returning the speaker to the divine, time and time again. As I drive away from the guardian I feel so incredibly thankful that this is the case, I feel a little more alive, more humbled, more compassionate.

Next day as he travelled from St. Pancras to Bradborough in a crowded third-class non-smoking compartment, wedged tightly between a soldier home on leave and a woman with two children on her knee, Athelstan Digby had the image of Evans’s Schalcken constantly before his mind. Long before they passed the glare of the Sheffield forges, he had made up his mind to buy it provided that the man would sell. If he had been hit by the war, and from what he had seen of him Digby thought that this was more than probable, he might jump at the opportunity of finding a purchaser.
So often God seems to deliberately overlook me, at least in my mind. My Bible? My Bible was once So often the Bible that seemed as dry as dust. There are times I felt as if I have nothing to live for. Sometimes, the adversary still tries to plant those seeds in my garden for God. My emotional pain seemed endless. I thought God constantly seems to favor others over me. But nothing can change the consistency of His word. Nothing can change God’s love for me!

From the highest point at 5,120 m above sea level in the Ruwenzori mountain range, to the Quattarah Depression, at 159 m below sea level, the river channel consists of flat reaches in certain sub-basins presently linked by steep channels. Within this basin the topography is diverse. The highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and the “Mountains of the Moon” in Central Africa give way to the lowland pastoral plains of Sudan and the deserts of Egypt. Tropical vegetation, snow-capped peaks, and some of the driest areas in the world, as well as some of the largest bodies of inland waters, can be found along the basin’s length and breadth.

Japanese import Yu Darvish is locked in. Sure, skepticism was abound when Darvish first started spring training. He at times, looked as wild as former Yankees import Hideki Irabu. Hideki Irabu he is not. He learned some lessons early in spring training. He also was hit around in his first start of 2012. Those experiences have quickly paid off for Darvish. Since giving up 5 earned runs in his first start, the 25 year old right hander has been tremendous. In his last four starts he is 4-0, pitching 27 1/3 innings, allowing just 3 earned runs and striking out 28.

Bromine: Is a disinfectants that can be used as an alternative for chlorine. In swimming pools, bromine is used against the formation and growth of algae, bacteria and odors in swimming water. Did you know in the United States, bromine has been used since 1936 to treat swimming water. Bromine comes as a powder of tablet form. Bromine is more stable than chlorine at higher temperatures and is more commonly used in Spas because of that. For spas it is used for sterilizing and disinfecting the water. Store in a cool dry place away from direct sunlight. When adding Bromine to your pool or spa be sure to follow the manufactures instructions. Keep away from eyes as well as avoid direct contact with skin and clothing.
What has happened in Florida is a tragedy of imaginable sorrow for the parents of this child, all parents who have lost a child, or who watch their child leave with a group of friends, who appear at best dubious, are always fearful that perhaps there will be a knock-on the door before the dawn comes. This is happening across the nation and it is irrespective of race, religion, or ethnicity. We have lost our youth to violence and most importantly apathy.
On Thursday night, I had the great fortune of meeting up with Melissa, Jenn, Sue Ann, and Cheryl (right to left) in D.C. at a fabulous tapas restaurant named Jaleo. I had met both Melissa and Cheryl at Stamp-A-Faire last summer, but it was my first time meeting Jenn and Sue Ann. I had the BEST time! They're all such amazing people and I am touched that they made the effort to join me for dinner, especially on a weeknight. Melissa was so sweet to plan this get-together:

From the research and the projects on search, I have confirmed my belief that search continues to be a core element in digital marketing. I have learned that search should be considered at every stage of building a website and any update to the site. The challenge with SEO is that the algorithms continue to change and websites need to be updated along with the changes. However, as recently as March of this year Matt Cutts of Google announced that over-optimised sites could incur a penalty in search results. The rationale is to reward sites that are most relevant to a user’s search query and have the most natural relevant content. This could be beneficial for companies that focus on content for humans versus content for the search engines.
The department's former Deputy Director General Astrid Ludin has been appointed to lead the commission and will be assisted by several deputy commissioners.

The pre-release price is only $29.00 - I'm sure there is an article (or 20!) in there that will end up making you WAY more than $29.00, so this one is definitely a no-brainer. From what I hear the price is going to increase significantly after it is released, so now is the time to get your order in... I know I can't wait to get mine, as all of us in this business know, knowledge is not only power, it is also PROFIT! :)

“I think like every parent, he worried about it as a profession,” she remembers. “But we now live in a world that’s so unstable that I don’t think there is such a thing as a safe profession anymore. And I’m sure that if he was still alive, he’d acknowledge that.”

Prog rock may well be the last uncool genre of music. Sure, acts like Battles, Dungen and Deerhoof have given virtuosity and technical triumphs a new, cool, edge, but barely anyone dares to dip back into the ’70s back catalogue of Gentle Giant or Emerson, Lake and Palmer.

In my 2006 article on this topic, I argued that borrowers who have not fully exploited all tax-advantaged investments, or who have high-rate credit card balances, are unlikely to have the iron discipline required to invest the cash flow savings on their mortgage month after month. But the financial planners who wrote me argued that they have developed special plans for borrowers in such situations that provide the discipline that is required. But until I see such plans along with evidence that they work, I will remain skeptical.

On Thursday morning I was surprised to see these two young stags in the field just below where I park the car. Having looked in vain for nearly a year I saw the deer three times this week as they were up on Big Moor on Wednesday too but only on the skyline and much too far away for photographs. I shan't be around for the next week as we are off to our house in Lancashire today. I hope the weather turns out better than the forecast which appears to be wall to wall rain!
Context on the show: Bart comes knocking at Milhouse’s place at an early hour in an attempt to get his soul back. Milhouse’s grandmother is staying with the family, however, and she’s filled with panic at the thought of an emergency that would require such an early morning caller, prompting her to shout out the above.

Wow. Since I gave up bread for a few weeks I’ve really saved some coin. I thought I was spending a boatload o’ cash on gluten free items and I was right. Yikes. So to celebrate Easter I decided to make a gf/vegan banana bread for a friend (one slice for me- I’m a weak mortal). I adapted a recipe from Babycakes cookbook. This one called for chocolate chips and vanilla and cocoanut oil. I substituted sunflower oil, vanilla seeds scraped from a pod and cocoa powder.
But that doesn't mean that I don't like to be showered with treats, in fact I insist on it.
I was captured in a fairy tale with autobahn thoroughfares and fast cars, stores with shelves overloaded with a myriad of products. Instead of one government-issue of an item, a selection? Instead of hoping to find an item, a choice?

The question, however, is whether the revolution that Jesus came to initiate has reached into your heart and mine. No matter how long you have been a disciple of Jesus, there are parts of the revolutionizing of your heart and mind that have yet to be realized. Ask the Spirit for the power to change and not to resist.
Every mother tries to start out doing everything just right for their perfect baby. Every maternity check up is in anticipation for that child to come and be with you. That excitement of watching a child grow inside of you and come out and then watching and waiting for that child to grow into an adult. Every step of the way, most aware parents try to do what is right and best for that young person.

Recently I asked Radford what she was reading. Her reply:I’m almost embarrassed to admit it, but I’m currently rereading Mansfield Park for, oh, about the 87th time. I have a bit of a Jane Austen obsession. Not only is she a beautiful, timeless writer, but there is also something so soothing about her novels – that elegant sweep towards a well- ordered ending - that I reach for them a little as if they were comfort food. I always notice something new on each rereading. This time it was the brilliantly waspish way she managed to pin down a character (Mr Rushworth) in half a sentence: “He was a heavy young man, with not more than common sense...”) – a salutary lesson on the power of brevity. I did find, as usual, that I was cheering on the villains of the piece (the witty, lively, amoral Mr Crawford and his sister) while despairing at her supine goody goody of a heroine, Fanny Price. In this novel, it almost feels as though Austen is arguing against herself, painting liveliness as a dangerous quality and championing a docile, downtrodden girl who could not be further from her usual strong-minded protagonists. Elizabeth Bennett seems like a much more instinctively written, and likeable, heroine (yes, I must have read Pride and Prejudice 192 times). I’m still enjoying Mansfield Park, though – there is something so irresistible about the “triumph of the underdog” narrative running through it that I’m sure this will be far from my last rereading.
If you buy the retail disc or the full Undead Collection DLC you also get the previous few DLC packs which are strictly online but give you access to new gang hideouts and the ability to play poker and liar’s dice online (both brilliant) and also take part in horse races, along with a new territory based Free Roam game called Land Grab.

The State has emphasized the need to strike a balance between economic growth and such factors as social justice and ecological sustainability. It is time to enhance economic restructuring, so that there will be enough skilled labor to undertake sophisticated tasks with high added value and accelerate growth in both quantity and quality. Wages will also jump as a result.

This album was titled "If friends were flowers, I'd pick you) so of course I had to combine the wonderful Tattered Floral die with beautiful tiny Prima flowers for the centers. I even went so far as to create my own little rose using the Tattered Pine Cone die. Tim shared this technique on his blog back during the 12 Tags of Christmas and I have wanted to try it so I finally did and I LOVE how it turned out! I actually managed to do it without the toothpick so that is even better for me as I rarely have then around and when I do, my boys think it's time to play with them and they disappear again! Simply adorable and seeing as I LOVE adding flowers to projects, it's good to know I will never have to hunt for that perfect flower again as I can create my own co-ordinating ones with ease.

Many stories that begin this way end much worse.

In that case, a swarm of gang members attacked Robertson and two friends. Robertson's friends got away and called for help; police arrived to find Robertson's stripped, swollen corpse.

About a month ago I was at the doctor with the hubs. As I was sitting in the waiting room I noticed a new mother and her baby. The baby was adorable, as all babies are, and the new mom was in awe with her little bundle. After a while we began chatting. You know, the normal "your baby is too cute" conversation. At some point, she shared with me that the baby had spent a couple of months in the NICU due to being diagnosed with meningitis soon after birth. Naturally, I told her about Footprints Ministry. After a few minutes into our conversation it was obvious she was in need, so as she and her mother (the baby's grandmother) were leaving I gave her my contact information and told her to please let me know if I could do anything to help her.

“Market conditions improved across the board, even from the rather strong level of three months ago,” said NMHC Chief Economist Mark Obrinsky. “Demand for apartment residences – and apartment properties – continues to grow. We anticipate this increasing further in the coming years due in part to the large number of younger households moving into the housing market and a greater preference shown for renting.”
Two weeks ago, our clients visited the neighboring village of Orr, where they met with women of the same socio-economic background who have successfully engaged in “kitchen gardening.” This method of small-scale vegetable production involves very little or no land, and mostly organic inputs. Home-grown vegetables significantly increase nutritional levels while also contributing to income, as families can sell excess produce. Our clients also received a demonstration on gunny-bag gardening, which is essentially a garden in a bag that grows along creepers against the walls and roof of the house.

It doesn't matter if you have decided to get your degree online or are going after it in person; you are taught how to write properly. Sure, you may not be a History or English major, but that 10 page paper you just wrote is teaching you a very valuable skill. Being able to write well is a necessity with any career. One day you may have to write a 50 page report and then present it.

The fourth factor, Abdullah said, was the government’s affordability which was aided by a marked increase in tax collection and a more prudent execution of expenditure.
That’s it. No light, no feathers, no voices. I even stood there too long waiting for it and got hustled along by our priest. At that point, even a burning bush would have been welcome. Chalk it up to reading too many books about the lives of the saints. I don’t know. Plus, bishops weren’t supposed to wink, were they?
On the inside, I placed a 2-1/2″ blue scalloped circle off-centre to the right and added the sentiment. Beside it, added a turtle. I stamped and embossed the turtle on some designer paper I had that was various shades of green, which reminded me of a tortoise shell. So, there you have it. A bit of insight into what goes through my head when planning to make my cards.

In 1944, Wingate was promoted to Major General and given command of six brigades (totaling 15,000 men) for use in long range penetration. The penetration was to coordinate with a British invasion of Burma and would operate from airstrips that they would construct for resupply.

But when Adam graduates and takes an Off-Broadway job in New York—at Nate’s insistence—that certainty begins to flicker.

However, I seriously wanted this $5 goat. I thought it would be a great (and cheap) alternative to a lawnmower. I'd read that they could be walked on leashes like dogs, and could even be trained to carry packs. For helping when I hiked to the liquor store, for example. But I knew I'd be met with the same opposition as when I'd approached the North Mankato mayor (actually, I accosted him when he was jogging down the street one day) about raising chickens in my backyard. "No, they're smelly," he'd said. "And noisy."
There is something intrinsically appealing to me in a scene of water and land meeting, the reeds and lily pads and the stones and muck underneath. It is comforting for me to watch such a scene, but I would never step into it and wrap myself in the water’s lapping embrace because I am terrified of the bottom of lakes. The muck and stones and worms and leeches and turtles promised under water, the same things that seem to evoke serenity in me when I look upon them, disgust and terrify me when I enter into the picture. Instead, I simply find comfort in the view.
There are of course, bits that cause me some confusion. For instance, I didn't want to be a Buddhist this Wednesday, but didn't want to wimp out without good cause; everything worth doing needs discipline. But then my youngest daughter forgot that her room had been changed around recently. She misjudged a corner and tripped,falling straight into a wall and allowing her tiny, romanesque nose take the full force of the hit. The screams were no doubt heard on your street too. The nose bled and became swollen and there are the dark, tell tale thunder clouds of bruising threatening her from under the skin. No chanting for me that night, oh no!

Six months - (huge exhale of breath) surely my medal is in the post? The little assistant is slowly coming around to the possibility that they could be something other than extremely noisy things that take up time with his Dad.

Unsurprisingly, the headline has been widely criticised. The Everton and former England full-back Phil Neville tweeted – “Have u seen front page of the sun this morning disgraceful journalism-what chance have we got!” – while a former editor of the tabloid, David Yelland, described it as “cruel” and “hurtful”. He tweeted: “So little compassion for Roy Hodgson today, bullying language, pointlessly cruel, pointlessly hurtful.”
Now it is time to break out the colors! I once again pull out the baggies of crayons from the HUGE box of crayons. Students then color in each box a different color from the baggie- I don’t care if mine use the exact ones from the Renaming Crayons sheet. I just let them use a variety of colors. I do encourage them to not let the same colors “touch.” When students finish coloring, then the glue the poem in the center.
Kudos to the writers and producers of Glee for giving the LGBT youth of today something to remind them that there is more out there than sex and that they matter and that they are worth it. I can’t help but think about how my life would be today were my friends Ed and Christopher still alive to talk to me and to be with me as I matured into an adult. Unfortunately, this big disease with a little name took them away way too soon and I miss then dearly.
In a large bowl take half of the flour and add salt to it. Make a well in it and add the eggs, oil, honey and remaining water in the well. With a whisk beat vigorously for a minute. Switch to a wooden spoon when the dough clogs the whisk. Add the remaining flour 1/2 cup at a time and keep mixing with the spoon until soft shaggy dough that just pulls away from sides of the bowl forms. Then transfer the dough to a lightly floured kneading surface. Knead for 8 – 10 minutes at least.
All behavior is communication. I believe that, i live it everyday with the children i visit and serve. Just like any other form of communication, behavior needs to be understood in order to respond properly. We must listen look and then repsond to this form of communication. If we don't we will not understand how to either extinguish it or help it to flourish. Yes flourish! not all behavior is unwanted!

Much of the reason for this was the inventiveness of a man named Washington Duke. Coming home from the Confederate army in 1865, he returned to his farm almost broke but with a determination to succeed that would lead to the building of one of the largest companies in the world.
Lou tells it best, “Hillerman was a warm and kind gentleman, who made me extremely proud and grateful to bring such an iconic character to life. Every once in a while, we get blessed with the kind of writing that brings out the best in us and challenges us to bring our hearts, minds and souls to a role completely. Funny thing is, he could write the words so very eloquently but had a little more trouble making them come out of his own mouth.”

For the past two years, Eternal Summers have been steadily putting out scrappy, lo-fi jangle pop that is wonderful. Their cover of Guided by Voices' "Salty Salute" for the Guided by Guided by Voices cassette is a particular gem. Chances are though you haven't heard it or of Eternal Summers because you would rather put a pencil through your school then hear "Scrappy, lo-fi, jangle pop" no matter how great it is. Shame on you if that is true. However, recently the band collected all their previous material in batch and released it at as Dawn of Eternal Summers. Apparently the band also used that compilation release to start stretching their sound as well.
My biggest thrill in life is helping people see their own gifts. It's a shame that so many people aren't aware of just how creative they are. Have you ever been in a conversation with someone who just cooked a magnificent dinner for a big party and they're lamenting the fact that they have no talents? Or the person who whips up dozens of beautiful, hand- knit scarves for the holidays and wishes they were creative when they hear you've published a novel? My jaw drops and I want to shake them by the shoulders until they realize just how gifted they are. :-)
I used "Tilda with apron" from Magnolia´s easter collection and used her to decorate a little album that I made with my Bind-It-All. Inside there is one sheet for each day of the week where I can write down the challenges that start this day. I used a light blue color to stamp the flourish - by Magnolia as well - on the inner pages, each time on a different place and direction and used different parts of it to decorate the tabs as well.
That was then in 2004. Now, in mid-late 2009, after the LTTE was vanquished, these tuyilam illam are no more. My information from journalists and Tamil people[iv] is that they have been bulldozed and obliterated by the army as the enforcing arm of a Sinhala dominated government. This can be deemed an act of desecration. It calls for condemnation. This essay is an indictment of this act, a protest that flows logically from the essay on “The Tamil Tigers and Their Practices of Homage.”

Both of these may seem nit-picky to some, but if we are going to assume an inerrant Word of God, divinely inspired, not written by mere man, especially if we further believe that every word is literal, then even small mistakes and contradictions become statements either of an Author’s character, or of our scribes’ reliability.

Beautiful days that are the epitomy of spring - heavy, dark downpour, then the sun breaking through so powerfully, blue skies overtaking the grey, a rainbow appearing, the freshest scent imaginable in the air, and then a misty rain again, but this time with the sun remaining...glorious and perfect.

The possessive correction? Meh. Yes, it should be "Mr. Tyler's" but it was a little hard to see where he put the apostrophe. It almost looks like a comma for the sentence above instead of an apostrophe in the sentence he wrote. He needs to work on his penmanship, but fine motor skills are one of his challenges common amongst those with autism. That's part of why he's in private OT once a week.
Maria - another in a long line of injured, but persevering dance stars. Do we believe that Maria has a broken foot? I dont know… I’m a sceptic, so I tend to believe the doctors are actors too. The judges really seemed to give her some leaniance in their scoring this week – she pretty much won the night, but I don’t think she was the best she’s ever been.
Off to states - it was interesting to see it all first hand - Chionia did so well and the scores reflected all the hard work her and her 2 friends had put in - They entered at Level 1 trio so they work as a team :) At the end of the night they were named winners overall and also took first place for their dynamic routine and their balance routine - we have a state champ in the house rofl!!!!! :) Well done gorgeous - we are very very proud!!!!

This daring group of students went through old books on student rules and became very interested in the rules that were assigned to students about relationships and dating. Their presentation brought both curious stares and ecstatic giggles throughout the room.

We entrusted Ling’s mum to order the best dishes that the chef can make while we went to check out the deck. The deck is off the Straits of Johor supported by wooden planks at the bottom. Although it creaked as we walked on it, it’s quite structurally sound. We then ventured out to the jetty and soaked in the view of Pulau Ubin in front of us and Singapore in the far distance. I suppose they get a lot of hungry Singaporean tourists who would come into Johor looking for cheap food? Mind you, at the time of writing, 1 Singapore dollar is equivalent to RM 2.50.

“Because she doesn’t want to be here. She’s only here to help you.” David turned to Ann. “Forgive me, Ann. If I have anything wrong, please correct me. You were ready to go. You didn’t want to go, but once you realized you were dead, then you were ready to move on. But then when you saw that he wanted to stay, you felt bad that he might be alone, so you stayed with him. You are a wonderful soul.” David turned back to Chris. “You, on the other hand, were not about to leave until your questions were answered. And for discretion, I will stop there.”

Honestly, I don't remember what happened next. I'm pretty sure I let my doctor know of my reaction, but I don't remember going back to see him right away. By this time my husband was on his way home for 2 weeks of leave, and I thought maybe the headache was just stress. It HAD just started right before the crazy back-to-school schedule, so I thought maybe having him around would relieve the stress and the headache. I even planned a weekend away at a lake with a couple friends while he was home. After my trip to the lake ended without relief, my husband went with me back to the doctor. It was then that he decided it was likely upper back and neck strain (I have a bit of weight to lose and a more-than-ample chest, so my back, neck, and shoulders are always tight). He prescribed a muscle relaxant and physical therapy.

The band's don't-give-a-damn underdog and outsider status is reflected in songs like "Matinee Idol," where Roger sings about pursuing a girl who's "running with the 'A' crowd/My 'C' plus is not allowed/But I've got the nerve/and I hope you're grading on the curve." He pictures himself as an overseas movie star (as opposed to the standard Hollywood leading man) in the "foreign films you do adore/Well, I could be a matinee idol/with the yellow subtitles/But when the subject turns to a date/it does not translate." "Crown Victoria" is a tongue-in-cheek, laid-back ska tribute to trombonist Chris Malone's late model American car that, despite its regal connotation, is not a mode of luxurious transport for the band ("The Crown Victoria/You are my joy and pride/The longer the trip, the rougher the ride/Is that smoke beneath the hood?/You know that can't be good...). In life, sometimes function has to trump style, no? "Permanent Error" is a soulful, reggae-ish lament about e-mailing under the influence, and realizing that there is nothing in the world you can do to patch things up. Just move on.

In 1933 this film has been banned from Italy apparently because the Italian Fascist Dictator Benito Mussolini thought Marx Brothers were poking fun at him, in person. It seems that Marx Bros. were ecstatic about it! In 1940 Mussolini, from Piazza Venezia’s balcony, made a bad Duck Soup’s parody when in front of a jubilant crowd he declared that Italy was entering the war alongside Germany (it seems that in newsreels there has been a little “reinforcement” to enhance the shouts volume). The end of the story is known (unfortunately, not a funny comedy).

What I do remember is Mike letting the big girls ride stuff that makes a mother cringe. And the little girls rode their first roller coaster. Even though it was small, it was really too much for them too because when it took off they slammed their heads back on the seat. I was behind them so I spent the rest of the ride hanging my arms over the seat to buffer their heads, which meant I couldn't hold on at all during this jerky ride. It was not fun, at least for me, but all the kids said it was their favorite thing.

Now, admittedly, I planned our schedule with absolutely no input from ‘experts’ and did zero research on the subject. It merely seemed logical to me based on my experience in public school – spending 3 months in the summer vegging out with no academic concerns and then spending weeks on reviews at the beginning of the school year catching up and re-learning what I’d lost. It seemed that not having that huge long break would eliminate that whole scenario.
The conversation Bobby listens to out on the ledge is being conducted by China Blue and the Rev. Peter Shayne, and it's a terrific example of the wacked-out chemistry that exists between Kathleen Turner and Anthony Perkins, as the two actors both seem to be giving it their all. Awash with purple, pink, and blue, the scene where the fake clergyman reluctantly shows the droll harlot the contents of his bag perfectly signified the go for broke attitude of the two performers. Besides, I also liked the names of the "disgusting array" of items he had in there. My personal favourite being: Foam Rubber Pretty Kitty.

When I first started writing my memoir I had a very different take on what I wanted to include. I wanted it to be more family history – mainly the dead relatives and my relationship with them – when they were alive. I’m not that weird. Some family flak, as well as some constructive criticism from another writer, steered me in another direction. My memoir is now my story of growing up a shy only child of elderly parents in the 1950s and 1960s when Dad is dying of cancer and the environment is old-school Catholic.

I think the rulers know their function. The rulers are the protectors of the Constitution. They should be above politics. Obviously politicians should not use the royal household for their political schemes.
And with the three affirmations, Christ also gives three commissions to care for His people and His church. And here is still more encouragement and grace for Peter and us — even after failure, there is still ministry. With Peter’s repentance there also eventually came more ministry. This is the work that Christ accomplished on the cross for both Peter and us — that which Satan would use to destroy us is redeemed by God and used for His honor and glory.
I’m not sure of the score in the battle for America’s soul, but the Red Team (not to be confused with Red State or for that matter, the Redskins, seen at right ), that is, the Social-Welfare Team, ran the score up from the 2008 elections until the 2010 elections.

Many countries have step up measures to combat corruptions, with many being successful and others gain support by their own regime; very much to mercy of the innocent ones. Bundling large projects with self interest siphoning of public funds are common sights in many countries. Some wealthy ones, protected by their powerful colleagues became richer. Whistle blowing remains rhetoric most of the time because those in power are accomplice to the corruption.

9. Writing well is a real skill. Although I believe that many, if not most, people could write reasonably well, very few actually do. Further, I believe that most people think they're good writers because they write every day—grocery lists, e-mails, birthday cards, &c. Literacy is not equal to writing ability. Good writers are rare and should be paid well for their work.
Next, I was in 6th grade. I wrote a love note to a girl. The teacher intercepted it. Crap. Read it out loud. Double Crap. I couldn't believe it. She was my first "girlfriend."

When I go to Phoenix to see my family I generally drive my mom's 12 year old Ford Taurus. (It only has 60,000 miles on it.) The perk to driving this car is that it comes equipped with a handicapped parking sticker so I can get those prime spots right by the door of most establishments. However, sometimes I forget that I have that all access pass to premium parking and wind up parking pretty far away. That's not a big deal except when it is 115 degrees in the shade at the height of summer.

My mother, to whom he was married in 1942 (a complete fizzle of a marriage that lasted three years on paper though it was over in half that time), was omitted from mention in his obituary, and his second wife is described as his first. His third wife, to whom he was very happily married for many years, is Linda Fairstein, the former sex crimes prosecutor who is now well known for her thrillery crime novels. We had a warm friendship, my husband and I, as well as our daughters, with Justin and Linda, and the omission of my mother from the story of his life is strange, yet somehow it is not unexpected.

This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice. They had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called ‘comfort’ of familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical lives. Fear of change had them pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were content. When deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have silliness in their life again.

To describe Angel Zapata’s short fiction as poetic, bizarre, and speculative dark horror is anything but fitting, because it doesn’t highlight the effect his stories have on the reader’s psyche. Zapata fiction brings horror to the edge of science fiction, mystery, fantasy, and literary, and then he spices it with traces of slipstream, erotica, and noir in a language that is both stunning and precise, ultimately delivering that meaty tale one expects.

So there are two big lessons to take from Guber’s book and from the new science of storytelling. First, storytelling is a uniquely powerful form of persuasive jujitsu. Second, in a world full of black belt storytellers, we had all better start training our defenses. Master storytellers want us drunk on emotion so we will lose track of rational considerations, relax our skepticism, and yield to their agenda. Yes, we need to tell to win, but it’s just as important to learn to see the tell coming–and to steel ourselves against it.
A promising day of blue skies held a hint of rain. Some friends accompanied us to Snowbowl. We began a long trek up Mt. Humphrey’s. Our goal was to reach the summit, or at least the saddle.

Her unfeeling parts really got to me when Rue died. Okay, Rue was a main-ish character so okay, fans are going to be sad now that she’s dead. Yet there’s a dead guy that Katniss killed RIGHT NEXT TO THIS WHOLE FUNERAL. Hey, I didn’t know the guy but I’m sure he had a mate, maybe an older sister who beat him up, a father who loved him..I bet he was a funny guy. Why didn’t (in both book and movie) acknowledge his death other than with a passing glance? Katniss seemed unfeeling to me in these scenes. The lack of describing minor characters bothered me. And the way people have interpreted Rue.

The High Court has ruled that over 100 investment bankers at Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd (DKL) are entitled to receive a total of €50m (£40m) in backdated bonus payments. The decision hinges on a contractual promise which was made back in 2008 by Stefan Jentzsch, the former chief executive of Dresdner Kleinwort Investment Bank, that the employees would receive a share of a bonus pool irrespective of financial performance. When the global banking crisis hit, Dresdner lost more than €6 billion, and was later taken over by Commerzbank. The promised bonuses were not paid which resulted in litigation.
My next comment might sound familiar to those of you who have been following my blog since the beginning. Yet, at the risk of starting to sound like a broken record, I feel I must point it out. The movie did follow the book very well, but it still missed the essence of what made the book so good. Once again, it seemed like the move was including certain aspects because “they were in the book”, but didn’t develop them enough to actually make them mean anything on screen. The affair was included, but it didn’t seem to add anything to the story. It felt forced almost. Part of this could just be that the character development wasn’t there in the movie. I didn’t find myself caring for any of these people, so I certainly didn’t care that Donna was having an affair. The same thing could be said about “The Monster Words”. They were also included in the movie, but they were just suddenly there and being used and for someone who hadn’t read the book it would certainly have to come across as odd. And the whole lottery winning thing was also rushed and forced. Of course, this wasn’t something that could have been left out, as it was necessary in order to have the Cambers be gone when Donna and Tad come to drop the car off. But it sure felt unnatural in the way it was presented. Once again, not having the character development was part of the down fall. When Mrs. Camber told Joe that she bought him a present, now he needed to give her one, it just didn’t really make any sort of sense at all without knowing all of the background information from the book. The line, which worked very well in the book, actually sounded quite dumb to me in the movie (and I even knew said background information). It seems like the screenwriter just used whatever he could from the book to make his job easier, instead of developing a screen-worthy script that could have actually done the book justice.

"In traditional publishing we had three formats, each at a different price. They were targeted at specific channels of distribution and were released at different times. There was some discounting by retailers, but historically not much. Then discounting became more aggressive and the channels of distribution for the formats began to blur. Currently some books never appear in paperback, some books only appear in paperback, and some books are in the market simultaneously in hardcover and both paperback formats (at three different price points). The digital edition (in almost all cases at present) doesn’t change in format over time – there is no difference in what is actually being sold. So, how should the digital edition be priced?"

Have Scripture interpret Scripture. If Scripture uses a word in one way throughout Scripture and not another way, it is best to interpret that specific way in which it is used when the issue is in dispute. Thus, in which way is the word anamnesis used throughout Scripture? Merely remembering something, or is it a memorial offering in sacrifice in Scripture? For arguments sake for the moment, let us leave aside the way it is used in the context of the Lord's institution of the Eucharist, since that is in dispute. Let us see how the word anamnesis is used. Now, in the Greek Septuagint, the word zakar is translated as anamnesis four times, ... Let us see the context and quotations.
By “Breakthrough” I mean those athletes that achieved a new level of performance – in some cases moving up near the top of their event globally. Not just new PR’s but also consistency of performance. And all improved to the point where I think they are in a position to help the US in their medal search over the next couple of seasons.

‘It was a lovely day for the drive,’ Nash remarked, ‘But devilish cold for drawing when we got to the hills….

I don't think that I have one! If I truly believe in something, I will resolutely defend my belief, but I'm happy to let others believe what they will and celebrate the differences.

In What Price Culture? David Throsby and Glenn Withers point out that, based on 1981 census figures, more people were employed by the arts than were employed by mining and agriculture — a point you also made in your inaugural address as chairperson. How important do you see economic considerations, such as potential for employment, tourism, and so on. being in determines the direction of the government’s arts policy in the future?

Today is our 1 year Blogoversary and even though I decided to hold a special event in January, I couldn't go without saying something today.. One year ago I was talking to close friend and she said since I loved books so much I should start a blog. I thought why not. Even though I didn't think I would get much response I figured how fun it might be anyway.
More likely, perhaps, the Metropolitan Police did not want the world to know that only a few miles from the Olympic Stadium, and four months before the Games begin, a Russian hoodlum has been spraying around gunfire. It somewhat gives the lie to the notion that London is a safe city.

Family Christmas planning in the 21st Century could not be more complex, especially when your family extends all over the country. To the rescue - technology for all generations! Really, get the greatgrandparents and the little ones connected! We are having a jolly time cyber-connecting, menu and game planning. Greatgrandparents are Gen 1.0, and so on until you get the youngest ones in Gen 4.0. How lucky are we to have 4 generations celebrating together?!
Today, I have a smile in my heart. I ran home on lunch to grab a bite, and right behind me was the Fed Ex man. He hoped out jolly as an Elf, and called out, "Lindsay, this is Your Lucky Day!" I knew what he had for me, and he handed me the box, and ask for my signature, wished me a "Merry Christmas" and then off he went, bounding up the truck again before driving gown my street off to deliver another smile to someone.

We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can’t go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy… Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.

Now, one of the main functions of having parents around is safety. Somebody needs to make sure the kids don't crawl under the trampoline or make sure kids' legs don't plummet through the springs while bouncing. Somebody needs to keep an eye out to ensure that roughhousing doesn't get out of hand, or that kids don't slip and bash their heads, or any number of other nightmare scenarios. It's really asking too much of one single teacher to watch 25 energetic little kids under such circumstances and ensure their safety.

Speaking of sesame flavoured things, this was a dessert that we had at the end of one of our many dim sum sessions or yum cha (literally translates as 'drink tea') that the Chinese tend to refer to it as. They're little dumplings made from glutinous rice flower (tong yuen), rolled in an almond powder that are filled with a black sesame paste. Oh my, this was one of Hailey's favourite things and she definitely let out a little 'oooh' in nostalgia as she saw me putting the images together.
But it’s OK, because Michael Ironside is ready to one-up this ridiculousness as he commands his two BDSM Cenobite minions to go and kill McLeod. They point out that he is so old that he will die on his own soon anyway, but since we wouldn’t have a movie in that case, Ironside rejects that sensible idea and tells them to go to the future and kill him anyway. Hooray for illogical decisions!

Since we’d waited a little late to actually plan this trip, our ticket situation had been tricky for the weekend days of the meet. It’s a huge event among Dutch speedskating fans, and most of the tickets sold out quite early; on this particular day, we had not been able to buy enough seats for the five of us, so John, Ryan, and I were ticketed in the standing-room-only corners, i.e. the party zone of the oval.
The Avocado (Scientific name, Persea Americana) is a native of South and Central America. It was also originally found in the Carribean. Sometimes avocado is also known as Aligator or butter pear. Some of avocado extract can be used as antibacterial chemical.

It’s one that has me puzzled because in my opinion, there’s only one answer. I mean, to put it simply, I can’t write anywhere other than my own house. If I try to write in public, I get the feeling I’m being watched and it’s incredibly distracting. Take the library for example – I’m sitting at the table with my laptop and Mrs Jones comes in and says hello to the librarian behind the desk, Mrs Pettigrew.

Marilyn even confided her deepest worry. “I’ve always wanted a baby,” she said. “Having a child, that’s always been my biggest fear. I want a child and I fear a child. Whenever it came close, my body said no and I lost the baby.” She talked to Schiller about being afraid that she’d wind up like her mother, who had been in and out of mental institutions her whole life.
Namnam Cafe (318 Wallace Avenue) is a fairly hip Vietnamese casual place which opened last year on the St. Matthews-Clifton border. It falls on to what is to my mind the wrong side of the divide (I’m still somewhat bitter about the time the St. Matthews police hassled me), but has much to recommend it: a bright, cheery ambiance, an apparently authentic menu, and a pleasingly diverse list of local beers. Generally speaking, I don’t go too much out of the urban core of the city, and I’m generally a bit dubious of Viet cuisine outside of the South End, so even though this was on my list, it was easy to overlook and I put off actually coming here for a long time. Their menu has a good range of standby casual-Vietnamese foods, including noodle soups, noodle salads, rice dishes, and the like: it also has four varieties of bánh mì: pork (analogous to a thịt nướng), chicken (gà), tofu (chay), and cold cuts (thịt nguội), all for $6 except for the thịt nguội, which is $6.50. We waited for some time, but it’s a sit-down place, and relaxation is the rule.

These are assumptions, based on cultural clichés, stereotypes, and personal experiences, which I realize is unfair to all those who are not at all this way. I don't want to make the case that *all* French men are perves -- this is far from true. The assumptions can get you into trouble, and not just French assumptions.

Ron has been concerned that he's not done enough the past four years. I told him that he has been busy concentrating on staying alive.

CR: I've lived in different districts of Paris (15, 14, 18, 3, 4 ... from west south to north and east). This sounds cliché, but I'm definitely in love with the Marais. The oldest, cutest, and most compact area ever. The problem is it's really expensive, so my flat (a cute duplex) is small, but I really enjoy living here. Shops are opened on Sunday, streets are beautiful, Seine is just around the corner, and I can really feel the heartbeat of the city.
The low ceilings and walls are blackened from decades of cooking smoke. Strips of meat hang like party streamers, drying from the rafters. The tiny shop is invariably crowded; the few tables are usually filled, so I always sit on a wooden bench, balancing my paper plate in my lap.

Well, let's start this post with Friday. Last show. Somehow strange it's over. And I don't know why I've got drunk after two glasses of whiskey and a half glass (not even half I guess) of absinthe. Maybe 'cause I didn't eat anything the whole day. Maybe because I didn't drink for weeks ('cause I took antibiotics) or maybe even because of the antibiotics, Friday was the last day of my 10-days treatment (another thing I'm glad about. No pills anymore!). However, three o'clock was way too early and I felt way too drunk. But I didn't had a hangover next morning. If I remember correctly, I never ever had a real hangover. And this was the first or second time I felt drunk, but I guess I wasn't even drunk, 'cause when I was home I felt pretty well. Hm, enough about that. I shouldn't blog about drinking experiences :D I'm just glad I didn't have to drive home. That's another thing why I usually don't drink when I'm out.

It's probably a safe bet that the station will do SOME sort of public affairs presentation aimed at the underserved Akron area - which still misses the nightly news program on what is now WVPX/23, anchored in its most recent incarnation by "NNA" host Mansfield.

And yet, everyone seems to be in constant search for love… even those already married or seeing someone! The quest for that “perfect soul mate” has ruined many a lives in the past and will continue to do so in the future… whatever happened to the concept of “Eternal love”? People use the word “love” to depict their ulterior motives… They often confuse love with lust, obssession and what not! Are we running behind an illusion, which is anything but love?

It had rides, a lake, a kiddie pool, and it was on Bay Lake near the Contemporary Resort and Fort Wilderness. It was meant to resemble an old-fashioned swimming hole. Here's the weird thing though:

There was no further rain, but we hit roadworks a couple of times, leading to quite lengthy delays.

Some hills resembled those around Ipoh.

But the BYC showed me that Joshua could have given up when he became a slave in the house. But he didn’t. He could have given up when he became a prisoner after being falsely accused but he didn’t. He kept growing, he was persistent in his faith with God and obeyed him. (And I’m sure there were times he did want to give up). It also taught me that we have to wait patiently for God. I originally made plans to commit to be here for two years. But after the BYC, I started to question if two years was enough. If not for the BCM, but DC. I realized that God has plans for me and sometimes I’m just scared to admit that I need more time to grow and be more faithful. But I need to be like Joshua and wait patiently for things to happen. Even if it means becoming a slave somewhere or thrown in jail because of false accusations, I doubt that would happen that way. Oppression here is definitely one of those things in the Deaf community. But everything happens for a reason.

Nowadays, movies have innocuous composed scores with moneymaking “soundtracks” featuring songs that never even get into the movie, except for one blustering, sounds-like-everything-else rock song that plays over the credits.

And it’s that implicit understanding of its protagonist that makes Belle de Jour feel still relevant and satisfying even today, when it’s social politics are starting to feel fairly quaint. It is a film about the struggle to embrace one’s true self, even when it clashes with the identity society puts upon you. In that way, and in a very similar vein, I would compare it to a movie such as Secretary, which explored similar concepts in a more conventional (as if such words were ever used for that movie) romantic comedy setup. But few movies delve so deeply into the strange and bewildering blurred lines between reality and fantasy like Belle de Jour, where the unconscious and the consciously suppressed merge to become one complex, delicate lens through which Séverine (and everyone, really) views the world.
As is every great shoe acquisition, today's started innocuously--I had just pledged to not spend any money, having several large upcoming purchases in mind to save up for, and I was out helping my father shop for men's shirts. I was absolutely not going to buy myself anything. The last time this happened two years ago, I ended up with a pair of Chie Mihara pumps that I still wear at least twice a week and I certainly do not regret that shopping indiscretion. We ended up on 4th Street in Southwest Berkeley, always a nice time what with the lovely CB2 and the Pasta Shop, at local and sustainability-conscious boutique Convert.

Keri is blackmailed by her boss to go and try to interview her high school boyfriend who has become a best-selling author and recluse. Keri only agrees because she is determined to win her promotion but realises it is going to be a hard job of getting the interview as they didn't really part on good terms. When she sees Joe again and he offers her a option of going on holiday with him and his family and he will answer a question a day or no interview at all, she goes with them. But she faces the trouble of getting on with his family especially as they all know how much she hurt him all those years before. At first she doesn't like the whole outdoors holiday as she is pretty much a city girl and she has to overcome some fears to be able to deal with the activities. The more time she spends with Joe she gets confused as he tries to seduce her but she is leaving again at the end of the holiday and tries very hard to make him realise that. She also finds it very hard to get any sensible answers to her questions and realises her dreams of succeeding at the magazine are slipping away from her.

It's pronounced Hay-in Broo before you ask (or something close to that anyway) and if you ever get asked, in a pub quiz or during a lull in conversation with a particular kind of bibliophile, 'What author's novel was chosen by the Faroese as their Book of the 20th Century?' you'll be able to answer with confidence (and for a bonus point you can say it was actually the pen name of Hans Jacob Jacobson. And if you really want to be a smart arse you can add that he translated into Faroese works as diverse as Hamlet, The Tempest, Hedda Gabler, The Brothers Karamazov, Wuthering Heights, and the tales of the Brothers Grimm). Publishers Telegram are the marvellous folks that brought Sjon into English translation (whose two books I would recommend to anyone looking for a literary shot of something a little different) and so I couldn't resist when they sent me this novel originally published in Faroese in 1940 and finally translated into English thirty years later. It is this same translation by John F. West which we can read today, a further forty years later, and it stands up remarkably well. It may be describing a way of life that was slowly being eclipsed 70 years ago but the wit and verve of Brú's observations come through loud and clear and in our current economic climate, a perilous one brought about through a reliance on debt (both personal and state-owned), this novel actually couldn't be more relevant. You may not think that a novel about the fishing community on a small island halfway between Scotland and Iceland in the inter-war years had anything to say to you beyond its only local interests but you'd be wrong.
Lost In The Glare testifies that Barn Owl know this, and suggests they are perpetually trapped in that netherworld, probably by choice, working on their sound unnoticed in some low-watt cellar. Spacious and graceful, you might file this under ambient drone, but I think that does a disservice to the slow-burning intensity of this record, and the range of influences absorbed into the whole. There’s no infinite drifting here, always a build to something fierce yet indistinct. Something is always about to happen, often a plaintive picking of an old-English folk melody merges, incongruous against the dust-blown Eastern backdrops dragged from indistinguishable instruments. Even as they emerge and build, the hooks recede again, a shifting mirage in twilight. In and out weave the thumbprints of early Velvet Underground, the stripped-down Mogwai of Come On Die Young, the rain wet moors of Further-era Flying Saucer Attack and the slo-mo fuzz of latter-day drone metal.

On Wednesday, I slept in a bit late. I didn’t get up until 8:45 and had to hurry to get breakfast before Bob started his daily devotional with the Fulbe guys at 9. It’s okay though, nothing happens before 9 anyway. After the devotional, I went with Sulemanu to a baby naming ceremony for someone in the church. It is a Fulbe tradition to not name a baby until one week after it has been born. Also, during the ceremony, they shave the baby’s head and snip the tonsils although I didn’t witness that at the ceremony. It probably happened after we left. Before going to their home, Sulemanu and I stopped at a grocery store so I could buy two bars of soap, just as a present to give when someone has a baby. One bar was from me and the other from Bob. They named the baby boy Ali. The father and mother live right in Banyo. I rode on the back of Sulemanu’s motorcycle to get there. Dayyibu and Umaru were also there. I had never met the father or mother before but they were very glad to have me in their home and very welcoming. I got to hold the baby, take a few photos and socialize a little bit. The women all congregated in one room while the men congregated in another. The men were in the same room with the women for a short amount of time to socialize but it was very crowded so we retreated back to our own room right next to the women’s room.

He prefers to just stay at home and be low key about it, although he does typically take the day off from work.
My few fruit trees seem to be all right so far. Of course, they are of personal concern, but I don't depend on the fruit for my livelihood.
It still amazes me that God loves me; but I know that He does, and this knowledge sustains and strengthens me on a daily basis. My journey to this point has been a long, and sometimes difficult one: accepting such immense, unconditional love is hard, especially after a being told, seemingly forever, that you need to earn that love, and that love can be taken away in an instant if you ‘mess up’, or you’re not ‘good’.
A docent told a story in the new Chazen’s African art gallery. It concerned one tribe’s customs over the birth of twins. As we step into Wisconsin’s future, this story reminds us of the need to maintain our humility and balance: between the differing needs of our city and university, as well as between our past and our future.

I have a love/hate relationship with horror movies. Now if we are talking Hitchcock, well, I love all of his work. He was a genius! I don't think there is a movie of his that I don't madly love. My all time favorite? Vertigo.. I could talk forever about all the psychology of love, loss, and obsession wound in that film. My next favorite? The Birds...

So many times I resolve to get to bed at a decent time, that I cannot make up for all my failures from the day in the night time. And even worse so I make the next day worse from staying up late and frantically trying to make or do something that I should have been trying to do throughout the day.

It is only a matter of time before the first buttercup also rears its golden yellow head among the flower beds - or, worse still, in the lawn. I don't know which is worse to remove - the deep, deep root of the dandelion or the creeping sneaky root of the buttercup. Apparently buttercup flowers make a good skin potion if they are warmed in vaseline. And of course, dandelion flowers make delicious wine and their new leaves are tasty in salads.
April. 5th grade. It must've been raining, because my class was playing a heated game of kickball in the gym. Mr. Timmer was our teacher, and I was the catcher. William Wainwright, my nemesis, was on third base, and after a decent kick from his teammate, he came toward me with determination. Though I had the ball, and was standing on the base, he put his shoulder down and knocked me up in the air. I came down on my left wrist, and broke both bones in my arm. Ow. That's what...28 years ago now? My mom was teaching at the time, but couldn't very well leave her classroom, so she had her sister Beverly take me to the doctor in Halstad. My arm had quickly swelled up to twice its normal size, and as we waited to see Doc Brown, he decided to spend 45 minutes visiting with an octogenarian in the next room. Aunt Bev and I learned all about Mrs. Alfredson's ferns while we waited.

One of them, for me, is taking time each day to share with you something that has blessed me during the day. I hope to accomplish two things in doing this; the first is that I take time to slow down, to notice, and savour the everyday moments that I take for granted. The second is to inspire you to do the same.
I don't have a week straight to devote to any decorating, let alone even one full day, so I hit on the project when I can. I may install wood one day and paint the next. Doesn't matter.. just move forward with intention to complete by a certain date and don't stop until it's done, preferably ahead of schedule. Definite deadlines bring new meaning to projects and it's no fun pulling all nighters.
This just makes things weird. No matter what you're thinking or feeling, play it cool. If you don't have "game", pretend that you do. This will avoid even more awkwardness.

Preamble:
I highly recommend this message by John Lynch. Tina told me about it about 4 years ago I went and found the audio and then bought the book. I have listened to it 25 plus times I have taught on it. It is in video now. It will wake us up from the drudgery of trying to please a God who is already pleased.
Since brewing the blonde, I've also brewed a stronger blonde that I initially intended to ferment with Wyeast 3942, but I ended up pitching some EC-1112 Champage yeast after about 24 hours with no visible fermentation activity in the airlock and no krausen. I didn't use a starter for this batch (which had a starting gravity of 1.060) so I probably should've just been more patient. The Champagne yeast took off like a rocket, but when I tasted this beer before racking it to the secondary it seemed to be lacking the esters I wanted from the Wyeast. No doubt the Champagne yeast took over. My solution to this lack of complexity was to add the dregs of one bottle of 2007 Boon Mariage Parfait. About a week later I added more dregs, this time from a bottle of New Glarus Imperial Saison from a couple years ago. Now I have very full carboy (it was full to begin with) and a little bit of krausen on top. I plan to let this batch of beer sit for awhile, maybe the whole summer, who knows? I have no idea how this experiment is going to turn out.

Blogger Jim Hoffman Wrote: “The scientific paper Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe provides, quite simply, proof that explosives were used in the destruction of the Twin Towers. Specifically, the paper positively identifies an advanced engineered pyrotechnic material in each of several samples of dust from the destroyed skyscrapers, in the form of tiny chips having red and gray sides and sharing a very specific three-dimensional structure, chemical composition, and ignition behavior.”

Having taught at a couple of state schools (and currently attending one), the students at these institutions are not well served. Many come to college barely literate, as it is; this is a product of the “free” public schools. They barely pick up any information, much less critical thinking skills due to the monolithic ideological makeup of liberal arts curriculum and faculty. Since the bachelors’ degree is unlikely to gain you better employment than a similar number of years experience in the workplace would (although there certainly is a ceiling to what you can do without one, thanks to the certification inflation created by idiotic, hire-to-specifications human resources departments), and you aren’t learning much, the degree is worth very little. For the value, you could make a credible argument it should be free.

That's sort of interesting in a macabre and scary way when you think about it. One would naturally think that being unfair would be dangerous and/or unpopular, instead being the victim of or objecting to unfairness appears to be the risky and/or unpopular thing.
I've always loved the Rose Bakery (forgetting the nice but inept Anglo service, overpriced organic fare) for its comfort food, edgy industrial décor, cool-crowd-fallen-out-of-bed-for-brunch vibe, so when Kaori Endo and André opened the first Nanashi in the 10th, my ears perked up. The local food press/blogger brigade did their usually circle jerk putting the the hot new table up their somewhere with the second coming of Jesus, but, as it was okay food at reasonable prices in a funky place, and the staff was really friendly , it got my seal of approval.

When I can, I typically take a long run after a day of writing, and I remember when I was writing the part of the trilogy that ends tragically for VILLAIN, and feel all weepy about him. Tearing up on the running path. Oh, how I loved my villain. Every villain is a kind of tragedy, and also a kind of rich and evilly delicious chocolate. What kind of chocolate??? I will tell you….

Anyway, there’s an interesting aspect of Timelash yet to tag, which is the way in which the story is haunted by Jon Pertwee. And not just haunted by Jon Pertwee, but haunted by a Pertwee story that doesn’t exist. This is not the first reference to an unseen adventure ever, of course, but it is in many ways the most substantive and deliberate. There’s stuff like Planet 14 from The Invasion, but that can be explained away as a continuity goof. And there’s stuff like the Terrible Zodin, but that’s clearly intended as a joke. And there’s stuff like Meglos, but that story suggests a visit that was more tourism-based. The only story to really resemble this is The Face of Evil, and even there the story hinged specifically on the unseen story being a Tom Baker adventure.
Earlier in the semester, when we reviewed Foucault, we talked about his general rejection of sexual identity formation as a means of sexual liberation. To Deleuze, zeroing in on a sexual identity would inevitably just limit a group of individuals who could be vastly different from another, lumping them together by one common trait, even if that trait itself is a unique individual experience. This identity, would not really designate what this person is, it would only remove the possibilities of what a person can become. Thus, ascribing an identity becomes a repressive force instead of a source of strength.

I've tasted a bit of this myself when I was part of a 20 year run where I ran either attended a summer camp as a high school student, worked in it as an intern, or ran that same camp as a youth pastor in Nor Cal. Powerhouse was full of moments like this that only hindsight can tell you were in part because of growing up in the area and sticking around for over a decade in the role. The last 7 years in San Diego have been an awesome ride, but this weekend was a fresh reminder that so much comes to those who stick around. Time to batten down the hatches folks, I think we're gonna be here for a while.
Because I am in the last 2 weeks, I am doing workouts for the "last" time. The absolute best part about doing workouts for the last time is that you can push yourself the hardest. You see, when I know I have to do the workout the next week I mentally hold back knowing that I will want to beat that number the next time I do the workout. Since I won't be doing the workout again, I push so hard I can even get a bit queezy. I like getting a bit queezy, it means I am pushing my hardest! I don't recommend it for everyone though ;)

One may ask the question, why now and why such a blitzkrieg, by passing all diplomatic norms, of even the worst of the Cold War and the 90s and quite literally fringing on war? Why during a parliamentary election and not the actual presidential? The West, that is the Anglo-West, did not even wait till the votes were counted to start its assault. Some areas were still voting and the OSCE had not yet said a word, when the Hitlery, er Hillery led assault began.

I’d still like to see adult-only bowling centers, though I think those are a bit of a stretch. I understand the appeal of bowling as a family activity and strongly support it as such, but please teach your kids proper bowling etiquette. It’ll make the game more enjoyable for all of us. Thank you.

As I looked at this old house that day, my imagination went wild with images of my grandpa being a young kid. This home has withheld a myriad of floods and hurricanes. The trees protected it. When I began this project, I stuffed my face into books. I saw our history boldly smothered over pages…pages that give some knowledge, but leave out a lot. These missing pieces aren’t easily found once generations pass and homes collapse to the ground. Just as a unique language and dialect is kept inside its people, so is the heart behind traditions, ways of approach and intricacies of lifestyles. Certain patterns cannot be sustained. Other patterns may need to be remembered.
Sometimes I find myself thinking about life, the universe and everything as I drive from school to school, as I do in the course of my work. The other day as I was driving along (somewhere just outside Bedale, I think) it struck me that I have been a vegetarian most of my life. I went through a comparitively brief period eating fish as well as vegetable matter (during which I was, I suppose a piscatarian) but felt uneasy about it, and went back to being vegetarian.

Beckett was consistent in his loneliness. The unhappy boy soon grew into an unhappy young man, often so depressed that he stayed in bed until mid afternoon. He was difficult to engage in any lengthy conversation--it took hours and lots of drinks to warm him up--but the women could not resist him. The lonely young poet, however, would not allow anyone to penetrate his solitude. He once remarked, after rejecting advances from James Joyce's daughter, that he was dead and had no feelings that were human.

The other day I was checking a prescription for a patient when he asked me how long I had to go to school to be a pharmacist. I have a good relationship with him and let him know it depended on the college of pharmacy but it was 6-8 years.

Pharmacists are the medication experts and many patients may not know their pharmacist can for them.

6. Brave (June 22) – Ok, so Cars 2 was a bomb and a rare misstep for the animated gods at Pixar, but if the lusciously gorgeous trailers for their latest film Brave are any indication, this could be an impeccable return to form for the animated powerhouse. While the Scottish accents and setting may not work in the film’s favor, leave it to Pixar to craft an engaging story of a feisty, archery loving princess who decides to create her own destiny after years of being told what to do by her Royal Parents. While plot details have been scarce, I trust Pixar completely with anything they do (yes, even after Cars 2), and in a year where female power is at a peak (Katniss Everdeen, anyone?), a young, spirited female animated heroine could be just the thing to return Pixar to animation glory.
But on the flip side, it was something new and different. And new and different can sometimes be great.

I was on the yearbook staff sophomore, junior and senior year. My brother Andrew had been editor-in-chief his senior year six years earlier, and had also designed the cover, a legacy I coveted. It was between me and Kim, and our adviser, the fantastic Jerry Halfmann, chose Kim to be EiC. I was actually relieved, because I liked Kim and knew she was better cut out for the position. Upon being told, I said, "Oh, that's great! Congratulations, Kim! I get to do the cover, though." To my surprise, everybody just kinda shrugged and said, "Sure, OK."

If the terms of protest can be opened up and redefined by those to whom that protest serves, then we’ll be free to decide how we will deal with the oppression we face. That freedom will begin a process that will invariably lead to the question of sacrifice. Do we really want to fail at making the impossible a reality for the next generation? Do we want the inheritance of the next generation to be the continuation of this struggle? Or do we want to be the generation that ushers in a new era of equality that will be unrivaled by any other era before it?

The design effectively creates a perpetual-motion machine, which physicists consider an impossible device.

The criminals and gangs of New York City had little respect for the Watchmen, who numbered only 30-40 in the entire city. The Watchmen were considered not to be very bright, nor very ambitious, and were known to be frequently drunk on duty. Each Watchmen had a post, or watch-box, which consisted of an un-anchored wooden shack, where they would frequently fall asleep on duty, usually after consuming huge amounts of whiskey. A favorite activity of the young ruffians throughout the city, was to catch a Watchmen sleeping in his watch-box, lasso the watch-box with a rope, and drag it through the streets, whooping and hollering like banshees. The soon-to-be-famous writer Washington Irving was known to be one of those pranksters.

Deep down, we know. We have our imaginary view and we have our reality view of the world. We just can't cope with holding both views at the same time.

Getting creative with my titles today, but it kind of gives you some inclination towards what went on this past Friday and Saturday. Date 14 and 15.
Prior to the conference, the protestors assembled outside where I caught a few pictures and a short video of "Free Free Fakestine","From The River To The Sea'' and the usual"Fakestinian" flags.
I confess that I go to Walmart once a week, and I'm not the least bit ashamed by this fact. Every single time I go down the clearance aisle hoping to discover some diamond nestled among the dog crap. And I almost always grab at least two things that I never intended on buying upon walking in to the store. Yes, I confess I'm a Walmart sucker.
A 5-year-old girl stood next to her mother at the counter waiting for my co-worker to cut a bit of fabric for her. It turned out that the little girl was getting fabric to cover a donation box to collect money for Heifer International. Isn’t that an inspiring thing? That a child can be so aware of a need that she takes the initiative to do something to help.
Tom is taking one group to Red Star in Greensburg to watch some brewing, then heading to Rock Bottom. I'll be taking a group to Marzoni's to watch some brewing, and then head up to Otto's for lunch and a tour. Should be fun.

Then earlier this week, I was doubly excited to read that NY’s pilot for a shared bike program launches this summer. Woohoo! 600 bike stations south of 60th Street; memberships will be available—like the Velibs—daily, weekly or annually; and, again like the Velibs, the three-speed bikes will be uniquely designed for the city—but ours will have GPS. Sweet!

I've been seeing these things all over the internet, and every time I do, I get the almost irresistible urge to gather up my collections and start photographing them on a white background.
You should wonder whether there are people who eat only British food in Palo Alto. In this example, those are the only people you have pricing power over. And it’s very possible that those people don’t exist.

Interestingly, only one of the films has offered us a teaser trailer as of this writing—Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter—even though it's the movie with a later release date. Is the secrecy surrounding Dark Shadows helping with its allure? Or is everyone just more excited about seeing Johnny Depp sinking his teeth into a classic vampire series than witnessing Honest Abe whacking the undead with an ax?

Today's challenge is this:
Obscured by the housing bubble and cheap credit, the well-being of working Americans was already threatened by powerful structural forces when the Great Recession hit. Technology supplanted routine work of all kinds, leaving millions with skills that employers no longer need. Offshoring of work to China and India destroyed millions of labour-intensive factory jobs. Low interest rates artificially pumped up wealth and consumption, but didn’t steer enough investment into the roots of the economy.
But, my goodness, how many ways did I enjoy this ale. And for how many varied reasons.

Recently I sent a link to the QS to someone querying me. His query didn't work very well, and I thought I was offering him a second chance.
This is pure escapism, pages and pages of thrilling relationships, turmoil and love all set against the exciting backdrop of three-day-eventing (the rules for which Walker covers at the start of the book, which might be worth reading for those not familiar with the sport, although Walker does manage to insert details and information into the course of the story without it feeling tacked on or information-heavy).

I shared this with friends at a party several weeks ago, and I wish I’d taken better notes. But let me just cut to the chase: outstanding. I can only remember so much, but I just remember everyone going “wow, this is great.” It’s a black IPA, a style that seems to be on the rise (Stone has one as well). I remember it being very mellow, with a very balanced hop bite that is subtle, not overwhelming like some IPAs. A touch of coffee. This is part of Deschutes Bond Street Series, available May-September, and I encourage you to grab some now if you can find it – here in Texas, I think all we get from Deschutes is Black Butte Porter and Mirror Pond Pale (seriously, guys, could you at least start sending some Obsidian Stout down here?).
Here are some more examples of what I've done with the embossing kit so far! On this layout I embossed the top and bottom of the title using Opposites Attract, and the branch the little bird sits on using Straight from the Nest.
The topic of conversation turned to their audio of a clip culled from this weekend's episode of HBO's "Real Time With Bill Maher". In general I have a low opinion of Maher, an unfunny liberal mouthpiece hack, and I was prepared to loathe his guest by name alone: Alexandra Pelosi, daughter of Nancy Pelosi. Yeah, guilt by association, and the rotted crabapple didn't fall far from the tree.

This is the new Saybrook rug from Ballard Designs and I would choose the black/gold on the bottom right side. It's a beautiful indoor/outdoor rug that would be perfect for high traffic areas in the home.

The ANC may be more subtle than Zanu-PF, but the ultimate goal is the same — getting rid of whites altogether. Most whites, English and Afrikaans, have seen the writing on the wall.
Looking at these purely as beers-to-drink, I didn't enjoy them as much as the Mikkeller single-hop series. If BrewDog are planning a second set of these, or if any other brewery is contemplating it (it's a great way to get drinkers actively thinking about beer and what goes into it), I'd advise toning the hop levels down a little to let those distinctive flavours speak more clearly. Yes, that's my excuse for scoring so poorly...

BEST BEATLES COVER. EVER.
As I said before, the Renaissance was (in part) the product of the Black Death. After being killed like...well, like people that are usually being killed during a pandemic they started to think that maybe they should care a bit more about their lives on Earth and stop worrying about all that "Life after Death" docudrama that was taught to them every single Sunday at their local church. For once in their miserable torn out by the Plague lives they raised their heads and looked up to the sky with great hope and expectations and said: "Hey! Fuck you!" and finally started minding their own business.

It was more embarrassing than funny now that I think about it, I had a lot in my mind that day – or so I like to believe.”

Since moving out here, Indie has backtracked a little on her night sleeping so we are in the process of fixing that as soon as possible. My eyes burn all day long as my night's sleep has likewise backtracked. Aside from that, she's smiling all the time now and loves squealing and kicking her legs to Ellen. She gets the whole kitchen wet when I bathe her because she just loves to kick those legs. She absolutely hates riding in the car, I think because she needs constant entertainment and staring at the back of the car is not that cool. My rotator cuff is frequently sore from reaching back and putting her binky in her mouth. Needless to say, I now hate riding in the car too. Notice a pattern? If Indie doesn't do it or doesn't like it, neither does mom.
He said mistakes made by AROs in recording the details of voters would tarnish the image of the EC, which has been the subject of criticism by the opposition.
Yesterday I met up with Elaine for lunch and a bit of a shop. I had to take a dress back to another thrift store because they forgot to remove the security tag. Grrr...I hate that! You can see the bundled dress hanging from the hook on my closet door in the above pictures (yes, it's pink) - have to keep it away from kitties who like to chew on bags.

So, now, here in the present...I've been in Louisiana for a year now and I'm in that "trying to figure out my place" role. There are tons of really sweet, really Godly girls here that I love. I hope and pray that we are gonna be here for a long time. Previous pastors have stayed 20+ years and I want to be in that category!! But right now we're still in the new phase. People here already have their groups of friends. And so many of these groups have been so wonderful about welcoming me and including me and making me feel loved. But I still know that I'm not part of the group (YET!). I know that's normal, and again, it's just a part of being the new girl and that everyone has been there and I'm not alone. But it's still a hard place to be when you're there.
So for eight years I have been desperately seeking 'Me' time.
I hooked up with Richard Hogan and his trainee instructor Stephanie and got a really good idea of all the equipment, as well as a good reminder of what is involved in climbing. Climbing is a problem solving sport, thinking about your next move, weighing up the possibilities and the difficulties. But there is also the risk taking. You just have to go for it, not think too much about it or you'd never make the next move. Look at your feet, keep three points of contact at all times, build your muscles and develop your flexibility. Going up vertically on rock walls with the tiniest of holds for feet and hands is one of the most exciting and demanding sports - other than base jumping I suppose. ( No, not on my list.)

Summer’s last hurrah continued to defy the crisp fall banshees, making it almost impossible to go into work this week. While the beach tempted me all week, I stayed away. This weather cannot last forever, and if I get back into summer mode, the cold weather will be that much more soul crushing.

I've been very good bout making lesson plans a week in advance. It helps me stay sane not to wake up every morning and scramble to assemble my thoughts. So now I post those plans where my kids can see them. I explained to them that they don't need to wait for me to tell them to start their work. Now they know what is expected of them and they can do it when they want, but no privledges until the work is done.
Grosvenor House Publishing is taking nothing based on these examples of book costs. I have seen several author solution companies claim the above royalty as a 100% royalty, but Grosvenor explains royalties the way they should be explained, that is, based on the percentage of a book’s retail price. For authors wishing to order larger print runs, Grosvenor do also use litho offset printing and will quote on this.

If you’ve got down time from your business, do not cram it with lots of routine tasks that you can easily assign to an assistant. Rather, utilize the down time for analytical tasks — such as finding ways to increase your sales or how you can improve a specific process in your business so you can deliver faster.
The newest collaboration is for Dark Shadows where Johnny Depp plays the role of Barnabas Collins. The film is a remake of a gothic soap opera that aired quite some time ago – between 1966 and 1971.
The swiss roll cake was really fantastic. Of course mine looked less than perfect, but the taste was phenomenal. Light and moist with the perfect amount of sweetness. I made two flavors of ice cream: vanilla bean and french vanilla (sorry, forgot which recipes I used), and added a layer of chocolate ganache. I made a mini bombe and a deconstructed version. Personally, I liked the deconstructed version better. But that's just me sometimes: disorganized and random (sshh...don't tell my students).
He was one of the word sellers. Or so I thought. He put out pages, bundles of words that sparkled, like crystals hung by the stalls in one of those old style markets. They caught the light, and leave you with something brighter. Some took it home, cherished it, and told him so. Some tossed him a pebble or two, of praises -- like flowers tossed onto the stage at the end of a performance, tossed and forgotten. Not a thought given to the work behind the scenes. But that's the way it goes. Some kept quiet, but kept the lightness too. And all was good.

Finally we get to the cruise ship and get through security. We are on the deck of the ship at noon and it doesn’t leave until 6pm. From that time we waited on our luggage to get to our rooms and went on the deck to eat at one of their free buffets. They also had a cookout at 5pm. There was a live band and I finally felt like I was on vacation. Some of us got up and dance while the band was playing and we was have a good time. We got in the jacuzzi and stayed until we left the port.
The court was wrestling with the nature of democracy vs. secrecy. At issue: whether people who sign ballot petitions should have a new right to add their names to ballot petitions -- anonymously. I grew up in the Chicago suburbs, a place with some very interesting politics. It wasn't until I moved out west, first to Oregon and, later, to Washington, that I learned about the initative process. Professor X and I did quite a bit of research in the 1990's on Ballot Measure 9, a precursor to the recent Proposition Hate in California. Like those two measures, the one involved in this recent court case concerns gay rights. This little gem, which I'm happy to say was resoundingly rejected by the voters, sought to overturn domestic partnership protections for gay and lesbian couples. Petition signers didn't want the public to know about their bigotry and sought to have the names remain secret. The Oregonian observed thatBut by signing their names on initiative or referendum petitions, people act as citizen legislators. Yes, in the age of the Internet, it may take some special courage to let your name hang out in the public square, but that is a minimal requirement of petitioning for a change in the law. ... Signers' names should be public in the same way that lawmakers' names, are public. Years ago, I had a mad crush on was crazy in love with deeply admired one of my political science professors. Something he said has always stuck with me. Just a pithy little truism, I suppose. But that doesn't make it any less valid.

At the same time, Dilla was ushering in his own group, the Detroit-bred Slum Village, whom many called the successors to A Tribe Called Quest. Dilla never seemed happy with that comparison, however, and always insisted SV was harder-edged and more materialistic than the Native Tongues.
James Gordon, Director and Founder, Center for Mind-Body Medicine, has conducted mind-body skills trainings for patients and health care practitioners around the world. Gordon has said, “Mind-body medicine requires that we ground information about the science of mind-body approaches in practical, personal experience; that we appreciate the centrality of meditation to these practices; and that we understand—experientially as well as scientifically—that the health of our minds and the health of our bodies are inextricably connected to the transformation of the spirit.”

Since the fall of the Berlin wall, very few, if any, white Europeans have benefited from Asylum legislation either here or in the States. Some might argue that most European countries no longer have oppressive governments so their citizens do not qualify for asylum. Others would question that assertion, and in any event how can these two men be considered guilty of anything other than a thought crime and the false belief that the right of free speech existed in Britain?.
But it’s what made Julia a star, so it’s OK.
Our present day prison system is built on the idea that the right way of dealing with bad behaviour is to inflict pain on the offender. While we are certainly moving in the right direction, with improved anti-bullying, some efforts at teaching skills and elements of emotional education, we still fall short in important areas. Most important of all is in fact public opinion. As long as people in society call for harsher treatment, and use criminals as scapegoats for the ills of our world, they cannot be treated fairly – and it will be their victims, and future victims who suffer.

My primary inspiration for this post is a recent post at Patrol Magazine by David Sessions. I love Patrol (as I’ve said before), and I respect David a lot (see his comment on my original Douthat post). I used to write for them a couple of years ago. I consider their editors (as well as some of their former writers) to be “friends” of mine (in that unique-to-our-generation, online-only, never-met-in-person sort of way). All that being said, I felt like the post was a tad unfair and didn’t give Douthat the benefit-of-the-doubt–that I believe he has earned–to think more than what was in the book.
“I thought not. I could make that land larger for a price. I want you to take me into your service” asserted the Voice in a tone that concealed whatever nefarious scheme it had concocted.

And don't get me started on the impact of fun @ work on productivity, creativity and problem solving. When we have fun @ work we immediately enter the realm of possibility and 'other-ness', even for a short time we exit our work-constraints and instead push back the boundaries of our minds to make way for more of the ridiculous. These very acts of 'exiting and pushing back' are the little windows through which imagination and innovation can enter the scene, and enter they will if we let them.

Everytime I’ve had à wonderful time or day My head starts singing her music. The lyrics of her songs are for us italians poetry. It is maybe not a coincidence but surely “blood” calling as they say it in Italy. My grandmother was Sicilian of origin (Catania) and I have all the temper, stubborness and love for life that the Sicilians have. This is one of the reazons why My closest friends call me Etna. ;) I Will share with you all one of My favorite performances since I was listening her cd tonight. Her sentence in this song reminded me of another reazon why I so much love skulls. Among so many others because they are the “hidden cause” behind an effortless beauty…
Then we traveled to Northern Minnesota where we camped on an island for three days, drank purple cows, took our picture with Paul Bunyan. For our next stop we drove a little further west to participate in a wedding: a matron of honor, two junior flowermaids, a singer/guitar player, a ring bearer and a reader. We all had a job. We tubed down a river, rehearsed, met some new friends and celebrated with dear friends and danced the night away.

Because we have insisted, and continue, to use and abuse her body for capital gain, like a pimp selling the services of a whore for his own profit, Gaia has only one of two choices at this critical point. She can either die, physically and/or spiritually – as many abused women do – or she can stand up and boot the abusers out the door. I’m placing my bets, based on the evidence I have observed (USGS world earthquake and volcano maps are useful), on the latter. The batterers are now becoming the battered. Our karmic debts are coming home to roost. Gaia’s survival is not our concern – she’ll be fine. Ours is of concern as, in point of fact, her health (and her other charges – non-human flora and fauna) is far better off without us.

What began as a hearing sympathetic to the police’s budget constraints turned into a barrage of criticism as the conversation moved from what the police required to do their jobs, to the savings that could be achieved by simply cutting out waste and graft.
With the current economic climate effecting peoples budgets, people are now more then ever looking for good value breaks and Kerry has something for all budgets.

Now starting out the book I loved how Harry really did have a normal life. He couldn’t do magic and still had to live with the Dursley’s whom I actually like, frustrated by like. Their attitudes are completly annoying but they give Harry a sense of realiness. Magic is not the only thing. I think that it also really does give more to the plot because it lets you understand Harry more.

The goal of this class is to think about what it would look like for the Christian faith to be that shaping, formative story which – explicitly or subconsciously – shapes the foundational ways in which we see the world. And the way we’re going to approach this question is through the writings of two English fantasy writers with a brief discussion of a Victorian journalist enormously admired by both our writers. Late in his life, C.S. Lewis wrote an autobiography of his early life titled Surprised by Joy. In it he described the effect that the fairy tales of George MacDonald had on him: “They baptized my imagination,” he said. Over the next six weeks we’re going to return over and over to that line – what is a baptized imagination? What does it mean for our very imagination, the core of our being, to be itself Christian?

So much so that 15 girls died in a school fire in Mecca in 2002, after “morality police” barred them from fleeing the burning building — and kept firefighters from rescuing them — because the girls were not wearing headscarves and cloaks required in public. And nothing happened. No one was put on trial. Parents were silenced. The only concession to the horror was that girls’ education was quietly taken away by then-Crown Prince Abdullah from the Salafi zealots, who have nonetheless managed to retain their vise-like grip on the kingdom’s education system writ large.

In future posts, I'll talk about other types of fun, high-energy Grand Entrances.
I don't want to be a spoiler here, so I won't say a lot more. What I will say is that "Started Early, Took My Dog" is well worth the time spent reading it, and indeed, following along with Jackson Brodie as things reveal themselves. However, I would recommend reading the three earlier Atkinson books, "One Good Turn," "When Will There Be Good News" and the previously mentioned "Case Histories" in order (and not that order!) to get underneath Jackson Brodie's skin and learn about this tortured detective. And I promise, you'll find them all fascinating.

“But, I need to know, why am I here?” Obadiah strained to see into the darkness but all he could make out were thick ferns next to the canal. “Can’t you show yourself, I wish to know who I’m speaking to,” Obadiah added boldly. He felt peculiar but not afraid.

This is probably one of the most bodgit & scarper things I've done (well almost) however the end result is quite comfy.
If he were traveling with a British passport that would provide proof that he was born in Kenya on August 4, 1961, not in Hawaii as he claims.. And if he were traveling with an Indonesian passport that would tend to prove that he relinquished whatever previous citizenship he held, British or American, prior to being adopted by his Indonesian step-father in 1967 … MORE HERE

This has led me to initiate destructive relationships, led me to dissolve good ones, led me to put my life in danger for any of a hundred stupid reasons, and led me to make more than my fair share of bad choices. Yes, it is this part of myself that has lead me to fall head over heals in love way too quickly and in turn led to recurring heartbreak. This is the part of me that used to be way too eager to trust and in turn brought me to countless disappointments. This is the part of my personality that has gotten me arrested on occasion – I’m sure we’ll get into this at some later date – and has even landed me in the emergency room on at least two occasions (that I can remember). Yes, this is the part of me that is often easy to anger, upset, annoy, intrigue, amuse, surprise, elate, piss off, sympathize, grieve, panic and embarrass, which in turn leads me to act out, cry, stomp my feet, concentrate deeply, laugh like a hyena, shout, grin from ear to ear, rage like an insane person, reach out to anyone (regardless of the wisdom in doing so), weep uncontrollably, completely freak out, blush and/or try to hide out. Damn, that was a mouthful.

So it’s against some code of ethics to accuse a priest of subterfuge, even when we have the evidence from historical scholars that Olivieri did precisely what I accuse him of? And if Mr. Palm thinks that I misconstrued the true office of Olivieri, let him show us the evidence instead of his mere assertions.
But I knew that I was supporting the very best cause imaginable. But it was more than that. I informed this family (who I do not know at all) that I was buying. They responded, "Oh thank you! No one has purchased a thing from us - thank you so much!"
I look forward to spending more time in Kindergarten classrooms – every secondary math teacher should get the opportunity at some point in his or her career.
I'm back at the Sauce, and I am at a loss as to which style to sample. I'm still pretty far from the 200 beers needed to get a plate on the wall, so I'm still drinking the beers on the Fire Sale. This means I'm going for the New Belgium seasonal, Springboard. The lady tells me that this is a blonde ale, so blonde ales it is for the night.

Moreover, during the administration of President Richard Brodhead (2005-), the university’s most significant racially-oriented episode involved not racism toward African-American students or professors but a racially-charged crusade directed by members of the school’s African-American Studies Department against a group of falsely accused white Duke students. Apart from a single statement from Provost Peter Lange rebuking an outright racist screed from then-Duke professor Houston Baker—and a vague, tardy, and ultimately toothless apology from Brodhead—there’s no evidence that anyone from Duke’s administration ever addressed this faculty behavior, or ever rebuked those Duke professors whose private biases led them to ignore their obligations to their own institution’s students.

Since making my big announcement I have been busy on several designs for new clients. It really has been a wonderful collaboration and again, I can't believe I waited so long to jump on board with Envelopments.
Contrary to every inner prompting I walked on.
The pros being meeting three or four close friends whom I still see to this day, learning to read at such a young age that I don’t remember learning it, participating in/creating several cool and creative projects, and experiencing the school atmosphere.
They were nice, tho. One bought me a Guiness and Napkin Man tipped me five dollars as I played all his 90′s hip-hop requests.

I've been using recycled glass jars, as I did last year. But this year, I've been washing them and then sterilizing them for about 10 minutes in a 150 degree oven. I pop the jar lids in for a minute or two. Once almost filled to the top, I screw on the lid tightly and then turn them upside down on the bench. I leave them for about ten minutes before turning them the right way up. When they are cooled the lids that have a raised middle should be able to be pressed to invert them. I've been using this method for about 6 months and with good success so far.
To pass the time, Mom started doing a lot of word search puzzles. It was her way of keeping her mind active. It was difficult for her to read, but she could still focus on one word at a time. She had dozens of those books lying all around the house. No matter where she went, she could do a puzzle.
I must say the cop-protagonist of this novel is one of the brightest lights in the clone world, an exact replica of Thomas Jefferson. But as I kept reading, the improbabilities kept bumping into each other and I just couldn't believe the storyline. Thank you for letting me see this, and I wish I could be more enthusiastic.

A lot of people tell me not to worry. Unless they've been in the shoes of someone who knows what it's like to lose a baby, then I don't want them to tell me that. I feel like I have earned the right to worry about Jude. No, I don't like worrying about him, but I don't like feeling that other people think I'm silly or crazy, as if I haven't been through anything to warrant extra concern for my unborn baby. All I know is a devastating ending. All I know of pregnancy is death. The only other baby I had died inside of me. No one can expect me not to let my imagination run. I can't be confident and calm all the time. I wish I was. I would love to be. It would make this so much easier! But I know I won't finally feel better until Jude is in my arms, healthy and alive.
I also intend to up the excitement factor! I'm a bit of a "fun junky" and I cannot stand being bored. I need to dance more, travel more, socialise more because as much as I like baking and cooking and family life, I'm not really all that domesticated. Plus I'm very good at doing all of it anyway!!

When I think about the times when I live in the moment. On the allotment, where I often just turn up, whatever mood I'm in, whatever the weather. I don't always know what I'm going to do. I just turn up and start somewhere on the plot... pulling up weeds for example, or planting something, or like last weekend, clearing the paths of weeds, covering them and putting chippings down. Most of the time, I focus on what I'm doing. It's very practical, often repetitive, and involves exertion. I'm conscious of what I'm doing, and whether it's hot, the birds chirruping, the strimmer somewhere on the plot, when the sun goes behind the clouds, whether I'm thirsty or not, how wet or dry the soil is, how it feels to dig the fork into the ground, the smell of the soil. I still think about other things, but the thoughts come and go. Often I can arrive in a bad mood or a tired mood or preoccupied and it works out by the time I finish. I notice what has grown a little more, I notice everything. It's the time when I am most observant of what's around me, but also observant of how I feel in a very uncomplicated way.

Point being: One of the best things someone feeling lost in the church can do is read history. You’ll meet lots of friends who can help you as you struggle, a lot of them will probably be from church history, but if you’re like Yancey, you’ll find help from several non-Christians too. Yancey’s friends are Martin Luther King, Jr., G.K. Chesterton, Dr. Paul Brand, Dr. Robert Coles, Leo Tolstoy and Feodor Dostoevsky, Mahatma Gandhi, Dr. C Everett Koop, John Donne, Annie Dillard, Frederick Buechner, Shusaku Endo, and Henri Nouwen.

Well, children have an amazing ability to learn quickly and efficiently. Their brains are like sponges and as far as language learning goes they have the ability to learn without many of the anxieties adults have. They learn for fun, not out of obligation, or to improve their resume, but because it‘s an activity. Enrolling children early on for English courses outside of school will only improve their school performance. Teens are similar in that they are still so young and have the ability to learn at such a high level. If you doubt this, check any teenagers Trigonometry homework, and chances are your opinion will change. Not to mention that after taking an extra English course, children and teens alike will have the ability to return to school confident in what they know, enabling them to really concentrate and fully engage in more advanced lessons later on.

These should not be treated with the same types of treatment. You are going to have to get special treatment and the right medicine to treat this disease. There are some people who have this disease will not know they have it. They may not have any of the signs of the disease. They may have painless warts on their sex organs. Those warts will be different in size and can be smooth or bumpy.
Not one of the central demands of public sector workers has been met. All public sector workers are still being told to work longer, pay more and get less.
I watched “The Beaver” tonight and that’s the theme. My title might have reminded you of the graduation speech at the end, if you’ve seen it: “What if some of human experience is just something that you inherit like curly hair or blue eyes? What if pain is just in your DNA and tragedy is your birthright?” I’ve grown up with these questions in and around me.
Again, not entirely a legit complaint, but I have utmost respect for SAPS. These guys go into dangerous situations and fight real bad guys like murderers and drug lords. JMPD like stopping rich white people in BMW’s and making their lives shit. They are like the bulleys from high school whose teacher was on the committee. Fight some real bad guys JMPD or GTFO.

Stephen Meyer, on the other hand, though he does argue that intelligent design can be detected in evolutionary steps as Behe proposes (thus, for instance, his provocative essay on the Cambrian explosion published in Debating Design co-edited by Michael Ruse and William Dembski), his principle argument is actually situated at the very origin of life. In Behe’s case, there are dozens of proposals for the steps leading up to the bacterial flagellum, none of which happen to be plausible or convincing – or at least not as plausible or convincing as intelligent design. In Meyer’s case, there is actually no alternative hypothesis on the table at all, let alone a plausible one. It is more difficult to imagine this kind of intelligent design proposal being dissolved. However, Meyer’s case is qualitatively different from Behe’s, since Behe’s proposal is for intelligent design to act as part of the explanation for how things evolved, and Meyer’s case is about how life arose at all.

I bet adamant watchers of the RSI are still pushing in however, given how the Wednesday opening got beat back in above a level that showed RSI 21 at above the 50 level, and closing Friday on RSI 21 at 58.8 while shorter term RSI adjusts down even further on its Friday close. Very few people thus read RSI as overbought, and it might come back in vogue somewhere around HK$21-22 assuming a straight run up.
