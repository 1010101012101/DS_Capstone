In the Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America two years ago, Lomax reported that he had recalculated Bolt's data and had added fresh data based on modern algorithms from his own software programs. From that he established that the epicenter of the 1906 quake was, in fact, some 6 miles northwest of Bolt's epicenter. He has since refined those calculations further.
"If you appreciate humor, go to comedy improv school - Second City's, in Chicago. You don't have to worry about breaking the ice: It's broken the second you arrive. I'm told it's like being on an athletic team, only you're throwing ideas back and forth and off each other. You'll laugh hard and get to know people on your team really well. And after class, you go out to clubs and see pros doing what you're learning." (Details:secondcity.com)

I head over to the apartment building where Salander commandeered 21 rooms on the top floor with her newfound wealth. It, too, is a private residence, stolid and ultra respectable looking. Standing outside the building, at 9 Fiskargatan, I remember Mara's punked-out performance as Salander, the victim-turned-avenging wraith, and am bemused when the guide produces a magazine advertisement for the apartment building.

Zach Lowe, SI.com: Amid the stinking, flaming wreckage lies some opportunity for the combination of intriguing young players and misfit cast-offs the Trail Blazers have assembled for the stretch run of tanking. Will we actually get to watch Hasheem Thabeet play NBA basketball, given the departure of Marcus Camby and Gerald Wallace from Portland’s front court? The only downside is that lots of these youngsters are guards — Jonny Flynn, Elliott Williams, Nolan Smith — and thus face competition from two veteran holdovers, Jamal Crawford and Raymond Felton, who have their next contracts to think about. But if the young guys play enough, it might actually be worth checking out an occasional Blazers game.
Draeger's pecan pie ($19.95 for a 9-inch pie) was "loaded with nuts," more than twice as much as any other pie. It also hit all the right notes: "buttery," "nutty" and "not too sweet." With a "good American pie crust" and "smooth brown sugar filling," all five tasters would buy this pie.

The Los Angeles production, with Brooke Shields and Raúl Esparza as the leads, was "erratic and somewhat overeager," Times theater critic Charles McNulty wrote.

The problem: While research finds that physician counseling can be a powerful prod to weight loss for those who need it, many physicians have been reluctant to offer it.

Only the teacher remains immune to the village's disease, a lethal cycle of punishment and retribution; only the teacher grew up elsewhere. Through his generous, inquiring spirit, we come to realize the probable identities of the evildoers. Beyond that, we're brought to understand that their evil has its roots in the prevailing emotional climate of anger, repression and displaced rage. The sins of the fathers are endlessly visited on the sons, and daughters, and it's not for need of a dramatic parenthesis that the film ends with the outbreak of World War I. The village's disease, Mr. Haneke tells us, is the German disease, and the human disease as well.

In 2010, those makers didn't know what they would be up against. They knew Apple was releasing a tablet, but nobody had seen it. They returned to CES in 2011 with a second round of samples, but they didn't know that they'd have to do far, far more than just make a tablet that looked 80 percent like an iPad and which they could sell for no more than 120 percent its cost.

But you don't have to despise Sharpton to wish that Holder had kept his distance. Sharpton has been a leader in seeking "justice for Trayvon Martin," a cause that, for many, assumes the guilt of George Zimmerman. Holder's Justice Department is investigating whether there might have been a violation of federal civil rights law in the incident. Those facts should have counseled Holder to send his regrets to the National Action Network, if only because his presence there gave critics like McCarthy an opportunity to denounce him.

But there are risks to this style. Namely, the TV screen can't really compare with a well-projected movie image -- not unless your home entertainment center is a whole lot bigger than mine. Even a high-def, flat panel TV is still an item in your room -- you're not sitting in the dark, with all your attention focused on the sight, sound and pace of a movie. No wonder the kind of textured sound mixing that works in a film, for example, can be a trial for home viewers.

While hives are being put to bed to let bees cluster together to keep the queen warm during winter, hobbyists - today's usual beekeeper keeps one or two hives for fun, not profit - can read about beekeeping. He feels joining a local group is "crucial" for sharing both information and strong stock for hives.

You can get sacks out of the three-man rush, as the Giants showed. But usually they don’t happen as quickly as the one the Patriots got late in the third quarter when Ninkovich and DE Mark Anderson beat McKenzie and Diehl. McKenzie got beat cleanly, while Diehl was expecting help from Bradshaw, who didn’t decide quickly enough whether to chip a juking Anderson. That forced a field goal instead of a touchdown to take the lead. No biggie now, but had the Giants lost, it would’ve been a big play.

But there was something unique and compelling about the composer's voice, and I look forward to hearing more from her.

So what's most important at these high-performance workplaces?

Success is supposed to broaden an artist’s perspective. Jonathan Rice and his girlfriend Jenny Lewis — who is best known as the frontwoman of popular country-pop ironists Rilo Kiley — are tacking hard in the opposite direction. Rilo Kiley’s early albums were as wide open as the Pacific Coast Highway. “Under The Blacklight,” their last set, on which lesser-light Rice co-wrote a song, stuck to the underside of Los Angeles and trawled those filthy curbs exclusively. “I’m Having Fun Now,” released under the cutesy-but-misleading Jenny and Johnny name, feels confined to, and defined by, one L.A. neighborhood: artsy Silver Lake, the Williamsburg of the West. “I get claustrophobic even when I’m outside,” confesses Rice in “My Pet Snakes.” Yup, life in hipster centers can do that to a fella.

Obviously, Jamie didn't learn from Geoff's mistake that eyeware does not a 'Voice' winner make and has taken to wearing nerdy red glasses that he didn't have before, which made him look like a refugee from The Buggles. Jamar seemed hungrier and more willing to take the title from a friend, and he buried him handily. Both men hugged and turned into a puddle of tears after Cee Lo maked his decision.

Pairings expert Lynne Char Bennett updated the classic party dish pigs in blankets, using tiny, spicy sausages and store-bought puff pastry. The pastry's buttery layers crunch so well, and make such music with sparkling wine bubbles that she used them for another classic, palmiers.

For a lot of top-notch art in a small place, you can't beat the Norton Simon Museum (411 W. Colorado Blvd.). It begins out front with "The Burghers of Calais," Rodin's 1884 bronze celebration of heroic yet human politicians (yes, you read that right).

You are right, Dan, that the rationale of John McCain's candidacy was undercut by changing economic circumstances and diminished interest in the Iraq war. Had the economy turned upward and, say, Russia invaded Poland, McCain would have been in a better position. So luck worked against him in the fall. By comparison, he drew aces in the primary. McCain's candidacy actually failed three times: once in 2000 and twice in 2006-08. Let's remember that he was left for dead when his campaign collapsed before the primary and revived miraculously because conservatives could not agree on Romney versus Mike Huckabee, and the party establishment concluded that McCain had the best shot at defeating the Democrats under the adverse circumstances. In the primary, McCain was also greatly aided by the GOP's winner-take-all rules, allowing him to garner a majority of delegates by winning many states with small vote pluralities.
