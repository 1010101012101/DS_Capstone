Willis said that Sam DeLuca, another attorney hired by Manzo, had negotiated the plea deal and Judge Jose Linares had given Manzo time to deliberate on it. In the end, Willis said, going to trial would have been too risky.

While not a new concept, hand pies turn apple pie into a convenient, easy and mess-free treat for Fourth of July celebrations. The term hand pie has been around for a long time; farm workers used to eat them in the field. Hand pies are different from tarts, which lack top crusts and are cooked in a shallow pan.
The new iPhone has an improved camera with a higher-resolution sensor. The processor is faster, which helps run smoother, more realistic action games. It's also a "world phone," which means that Verizon iPhones will be able to useable overseas, just as AT&T iPhones already are.

• Sacramento 95, Portland 92: Same old story as Blazers falter on the road -- Joe Freeman, The Oregonian: The Kings, who were creamed by the Blazers in two previous meetings this season and had lost five games in a row, were rejuvenated. They took their first lead late in the third quarter and opened up as large as a seven-point edge in the fourth quarter. The Blazers were a head case throughout the final quarter, which has haunted them on the road this season. They shot 38.1 percent, committed three costly turnovers and twice they had three-on-one fast-break opportunities that the Kings stymied.

Clayton broke into a home in 2010, bound the occupants and took their belongings. He was convicted in Lorain County Common Pleas Court while free on a $100,000 bond and failed to report to prison to serve a four-year sentence, Deputy Marshal Ryan Helfrich said.
The three-hour hearing inside the gymnasium at City Academy, 4175 North Kingshighway, primarily focused on the potential impact of Turner vs. Clayton, a lawsuit that could open the doors of schools in St. Louis County to students in unaccredited districts, such as St. Louis and Riverview Gardens.

After the game, I swung by the base-selling table behind home plate, and found they sold two bases to a pair of poor souls with more money than sense, plus one from the day before for $200. Although that might be harsh; the most surprising thing about the base-vending is, judging by mark-up, the bases are one of the bigger values at Wrigley, since a new base costs about $150 online.

The best meal of my visit was across the street from the market at St. John Bread & Wine (94-96 Commercial St.), which opened in 2003 as a more casual offshoot of the Michelin-star-winning St. John restaurant in nearby Smithfield. Both St. Johns revere "the whole beast" and load their menus with offal and cuts of meat seldom seen anywhere else. I ordered the deviled sprats -- just because it sounded good -- and soon confronted a plateful of six-inch fish, heads and skins attached, all so tender and savory that it was a joy to swallow their bodies, bones and all.

"If you sat Jerry Brown down and asked, 'Why are you running, are you mad?' " Gore queried one evening, "I bet he would go absolutely blank." The proposition seemed true enough to me, because, as Gore maintained, "you're not supposed to ask them why they run. They run because it's a compulsion."
Well America, you have spoken. And judging by your votes/downloads/reprieves, I am 4 for 6 in lockstep with you. But clearly you are better people than I. Me, I'm still thinking of the elimination round the way a cold-hearted A&R man would, envisioning who here can realistically have a long recording career. You, America, have a lot more empathy, choosing to keep two contestants whose parents have that pancreatic cancer we keep hearing so much about on this show. You saved Erin Willett (Team Blake) and Chris "Opera Mann" Mann (Team Christina). Or "Luciano Pava-Rotten," as my editor dared me to call him. Please don't write nasty letters to Ed.

Stretching northwest from Bolinas, the 100-square-mile peninsula is proof of Simon Winchester's assertion that dramatic landscapes go hand-in-hand with tectonic mischief. The long finger of water called Tomales Bay is actually a rift zone of the San Andreas Fault, and Point Reyes has been peeling inexorably away from North America at the rate of 2 inches a year. It isn't always a slow creep: During the 1906 earthquake, the entire peninsula shifted 16 to 20 feet in one cataclysmic jolt. If you put off your visit for 5 million years, you'll need a ferry to get there.

Fair officials have yet to release the theme for the 2012 extravaganza  you'll have to wait until May  but the essence of the fair every year can be gleaned from the name of its website  "Big Fun." Ah, yes, deep-fried dough round as a hubcap, and breaded, fried sticks of butter longer than a billy club. Presumably, the big thinkers with the fair have other things in mind beyond attendees' stomachs. But let's be real: The fair could go themeless one year, and it wouldn't matter; you'd still go. It's the fair. You've been inculcated since toddlerhood to want to go.

There are houseguests who join the search party, and most are drawn with good attention to detail. Joseph's sister, Penny (Dianne Wiest), and her new boyfriend, Russell (Richard Jenkins), make an odd pair. He's got a scheme to open an English pub in Omaha with Penny's savings. Her adult son, Bryan, played by Mark Duplass, views Russell as an AARP gigolo. Bryan was sent to med school by his uncle and works with him; he seems to have inherited some of Joseph's control-freak tendencies. He overlooks the fact that his mom is glowing. Russell makes Penny happier than she's been in ages.

The show is El Monstero's most ambitious production yet. An oversize stage was built out into the audience with more than a hundred seats on the stage itself, giving an "in the round" perspective.

Already, the single vacancy on the court has had an impact on its ability to function. Last month, the justices split 3-3 on whether to hear a motion by six gay couples to hear their request for the right to marry.

In recent times our military cooperation has deepened a lot. And the United States assists us in reforming our armed forces. They assist us to increase our capabilities in peacekeeping.

I wrote earlier that while I find Guillen's remarks stupid and insensitive -- and completely understand why many people were offended by them -- I thought it was wrong to punish him for them. The Marlins decided to suspend Guillen anyway, and trying to appease the outrage felt by much of the Cuban-American portion of the team's fan base certainly had something to do with that. While I might not agree with the decision, I understand it, and it's their prerogative.

TV Land's first original sitcom, "Hot in Cleveland," is old-fashioned by design — right down to the live studio audience that the show tapes in front of — but an ace cast gives this throwback some zip. Valerie Bertinelli, Wendie Malick and Jane Leeves play fading showbiz types who move to Cleveland and live in a house with a wacky old woman played by Betty White while they figure out the next step in their lives. The jokes are too pat (and surprisingly raunchy), but the company's good, and the show succeeds at generating the nostalgic, "TV comfort food" vibe it's aiming for. The DVD adds featurettes, bloopers and the original pilot episode.

The next move may come from the FCC, which has been looking for a way to impose Net neutrality rules. The agency's most recent attempt, however, was swatted down by a federal appeals court this spring. To move forward with regulations, it probably would have to reclassify broadband as a regulated telecommunications service, similar to voice traffic. That would be a lengthy process and probably would face a new court challenge.

"I remember when she first made it, she bought a red drop-top and drove it down Dodd Street," Munford said with a smile as he left flowers outside the school.
But Mitt's not wrong. In the end, a corporation doesn't pay tax. The marble atrium of Global MegaCorp's corporate HQ is indifferent to the tax rate; the Articles of Incorporation in the bottom drawer of the chairman's desk couldn't care less. Every dollar of "corporate" tax has to be fished out the pocket of a real flesh-and-blood human being, whether shareholder, employee or customer.

Browns need to get early picks right as most will be expected to start right away.

For the young chairman of the House Budget Committee, it was a timely lesson: However much Ryan may wish it, God does not take sides in politics.

The once-austere dining room is now warmer and sexier, with pale light, slate walls and candles glowing everywhere. But service needs work, as waiters seem bewildered by the new approach. Castagna's kitchen needs a translator: informed, confident servers who can bring us along on this unusual ride from the moment we sit down. And, good grief, why is Motown playing on the sound system? Does anyone really want to "hitchhike" to Marvin Gaye while eating food as riveting as a Charlie Parker riff?

The 87 newly elected House tea party representatives have good reason to defeat the McConnell plan because it relieves the pressure to achieve their objectives of reducing the deficit, the national debt and the size of government. If the House Republicans settle for posturing with votes to cut spending, cap the size of government and pass a balanced budget amendment but in the end enact the McConnell palliative, there will be many more profiles in cowardice.

Robyn records two kinds of songs. The first are pure synthesizer meltdowns like "Fembot" and "Cobrastyle" — songs that suggest what Yaz might have sounded like if Alison Moyet and Vince Clarke had had the benefit of a heavy hip-hop influence. The others are traditional verse-chorus pop numbers arranged for drum machine and synth, pitched somewhere between Ace of Base and Madonna at her most Euro-detached (think "Live to Tell" or "Ray of Light"). Beyond the oscillating bass synth and the auto-panning sound effects, "Call Your Girlfriend" is a very traditional pop song. Only the message is unconventional.

The case, Turner vs. Clayton, had the potential to affect 72,000 children living in the boundaries of the St. Louis and Riverview Gardens districts. While it has meandered through the courts for five years, the case has fixated education officials nearly two years ago after a ruling by the state Supreme Court.

He also was prickly, arrogant and hard to work with, with an abrasive style that alienated many, from junior aides to senior generals and allies. Those qualities were a key reason Holbrooke never achieved his life's ambition of becoming secretary of state. He reportedly barely held onto the envoy's job in Afghanistan after alienating U.S. war fighters and Afghans alike.

As Obama navigates a crossroads of his presidency, a moment when he signals what lessons he has drawn from his first year in office, the public posture of the White House is that any shortcomings are the result of failing to explain effectively what they were doing -- and why.

He leads a brief tour, pausing in front of a framed picture of himself standing with Paul McCartney. He recalls seeing the Beatles perform in Minneapolis when he was a teenager, how music has always occupied a central place in his life. His dad was an insurance salesman, and the Sarnoffs moved around a lot. But no matter where they lived, Lawrence Sarnoff had his hi-fi in the living room. "Boy, he loved his jazz," Les Sarnoff says.

He wanted, in Miller's summary, "reliable and protected trading routes — as well as political and economic stability within America's trading partners." The difference for the locals would be minimal, as Cuban and Philippine rebels learned after throwing their support to American troops they believed were liberating them, only to hear all talk of self-government relegated to the unspecified future after the U.S. victory in the Spanish-American War. Perhaps they took comfort from McKinley's assurances that "their welfare is our welfare."
America's streak of bad luck continued in the second round, as Mario Deslauriers, an 8-faulter with Cella in the first round, was going clear until his gray mare surprisingly ran out at the last fence.

Some merely startling images, too. The film begins with a credits sequence — all Led Zeppelin metal, and naked bodies writhing in crude oil — that wouldn’t feel out of place in a James Bond film; later landscapes make much of the grays and whites of wintry Sweden.

Cramped and dingy, with a bar at the front, and a minuscule stage in the back, the Fishtown venue is all frivolity and kitsch. A big angelic portrait of Tupac Shakur hung near the stage, which was draped by a secondhand red curtain and decorated with some cheap, plastic skulls. A solitary disco ball hung above the tiny dance floor. Performing Saturday night was a hip-hop duo, Sgt. Sass, who bill themselves as gay equivalents of Missy Elliott and Lil' Kim. Though there were fewer than 50 people in front of them, DeShawn Seymore and DaQuan Motley played the room with all the energy and fierce bravado of arena headliners.

Chris Cooper, a program coordinator with the Small Business Succession Planning Program at Kent State University, said only about 30 percent of all family-owned businesses make it to the second generation.

3 If you want your party to win in November, help it select the best candidate in May. Consider the Republican presidential primary: As more people voted, the party settled on Mitt Romney, clearly the GOP's best hope this year. If only the most ideologically driven voters had turned out, the party might be heading toward November with Herman Cain or Newt Gingrich at the top of the ballot -- and we all know how that would have turned out. It's just like in baseball: If you want your team to win in the fall, field the strongest team in the spring.

But the Dartmouth program is unusual - unique in Dartmouth minds - because of the combination of focus on delivery at the patient level, along with its use of distance learning via the Internet and the need for buy-in from students' bosses, who often pay the $83,600 tuition.

That's because America's system of governing is designed to force compromise. Both houses of Congress must pass, and the president must sign, a bill before it can become law. The Senate requires 60 "yes" votes to advance most legislation. Congressional overrides of presidential vetoes require supermajorities. As a result, most initiatives require either bipartisan support to succeed or one party to have a commanding advantage over its opponents.

Snider never thought much about writing until he crafted a one-act play that he produced, cast and paid for. The effort prompted a call from an editor who asked him if he wanted to write a book.

I needed to share what I was reading with other believers, to pray with other believers, but I had closed a heavy door behind me and walked away.

The administration has repeatedly said that faculty and students don't understand budgets. The administration has consistently refused to be transparent about PSU's finances, and administrators have admitted that some of the surplus is being put aside for "strategic investments," but they won't reveal how much or what those investments might be. Clearly, investing in human infrastructure isn't what administrators mean by "strategic investment," so one assumes that they are referring to the various private-public partnerships that PSU has been promoting, such as the Oregon Sustainability Center. This center will most likely not be built because it lacks state support, but PSU was poised to invest in a building that looks more like a risky venture capital project than a "strategic investment" in the core mission of the university.
