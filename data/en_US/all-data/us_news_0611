To McClure, it’s a mindset. Buchholz hasn’t demonstrated much faith in his changeup, widely regarded as his best pitch. Once he gets a feel for his changeup again, feels McClure, he likely will see better results with his other pitches.

It’s a worthwhile topic for anyone voting for Rice as he takes on Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in the Madden NFL 13 cover competition. Linebacker Ray Lewis, the 2005 cover boy – a bit of a misnomer, don’t you think? – emerged from his Madden-linked season relatively unscathed, missing only one game, but the game’s history is littered with tales of NFL stars burning out.

Getting started isn't as intimidating as it might seem. Search YouTube for "cyclocross skills videos" or "cyclocross dismounts and remounts" and you'll be overwhelmed with virtual instructors. The beginners that I work with typically master the dismount quickly and then find they are vexed by the seemingly impossible remount, which looks a little like magic when done correctly. Practice often, starting in slow motion and gradually increasing speed as your comfort level rises. Science tells us that this kind of motor learning demands thousands of repetition to become subconscious. It took me three full seasons to really get the remount down, but that didn't stop me from racing.

I enjoyed "Money on the table" (April 23), an editorial about reforming the out-of-date Missouri tax code. In addition to being one of only six states that give deductions for federal income tax, Missouri is one of only three states that allow deductions for Social Security taxes. This deduction is used only by higher-income taxpayers who itemize their deductions, and, therefore, it has a de facto effect of passing the tax burden for the state onto those who don't itemize.
Unfortunately for the rest of the Pacific-12 Conference, that choice is the Ducks.
Now what the Browns are saying by drafting Weeden and not significantly adding to the receiving corps in the draft (after ignoring the position in free agency) is that Colt McCoy was part of the problem.

"I believe he had another test today and if the test comes back well, he'll start swinging (Saturday)."

After a 3-for-4 night with a home run and two RBIs, Girardi was encouraged by what he saw from Rodriguez. "He drove the ball the other way, he was patient, he got his pitch," Girardi said. ...

True, the "downstreaming" (from Columbus) of state costs to local taxpayers got into high gear during Republican Gov. James Rhodes' 1963-71 administration. That, conveniently, also downstreamed to mayors, county commissioners and Ohio's bazillion special districts, boards and authorities the political heat for taxes -- heat school boards already faced, and still face. The rationalization in Columbus was that if a locality wanted "extras," its voters should find a way to pay for them. Problem is, what Ohio considers "extras," the rest of the country might fairly consider "bare minimums."

David Backes, Patrick Berglund, Alex Pietrangelo and Alex Steen have taken their games to new levels over the last 12 months and I expect all of them to have big seasons again in 2011-2012.

Is the new proposal really the fairest way to collect the revenue the state needs, or is it just a reflection of who complained the loudest?

"It is not the record. It is not about the skills they learned. It is entirely about the personal touch--the caring," Conard said, adding that Bugliari does not like to see people unhappy.

A cynic might say “typical Jose Reyes” and dredge up the way Reyes asked to be pulled from Game 162 a year ago to protect his .337 average, which would ultimately be the number that made him the Mets first National League batting champ. But that would be petty. Judging Reyes on that one selfish moment, on the final day of a 77-win season, would be wrong. The truth is that Reyes was a joy to watch for nine seasons.
Feiss's lawyer says in court papers that she has met numerous times with investigators to provide information about the scam. Feiss is asking for probation and community service, partly because she has a 14-year-old daughter to care for.

“We should raise the minimum wage. We have to restore the earned income tax credit,” said Weinberg. “I support tax breaks for job creation, but how can we justify giving tax breaks to the rich and corporate America while eliminating them for workers struggling at the minimum wage? It is not fair and it is not ok.”

Brandon Snyder homered and had a career-high six RBIs against his former team, and the Texas Rangers beat Baltimore 14-3 Monday night to end the Orioles' five-game winning streak.
A friend of a friend gets me into Shoreditch House, and I slurp an overpriced gin and tonic poolside, admiring the sun setting across the nearby city, London's downtown. But no A-listers cross my radar, so the next afternoon, I find Dalston Roof Park. This cheery venue is more my speed, built on the summit terrace of an old paint factory; free "membership" is open to all.
Given this sad state of the union, I was drawn to the title of a new book by uber-pundit Thomas L. Friedman and noted political scientist Michael Mandelbaum: "That Used to Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back."
"Over the last three years, the tide has turned," Obama said. "We broke the Taliban's momentum. We've built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al Qaeda's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set - to defeat al Qaeda, and deny it a chance to rebuild - is within reach."
She said al-Khawaja repeated his claims that he was force-fed with nasal tubes and IVs in the past week. Bahrain denied the charges, saying he agreed to all treatments.
 Check your irrigation system every month for leaks and misdirected sprinkler heads.
Over the past few weeks, Christie has been hailed in conservative editorial pages such as The Weekly Standard and The Wall Street Journal for cutting from the state budget and, as he says, inflicting pain on all levels of government, instead of raising state taxes, such as an income tax on earnings over $400,000.
That same balance shows on one of his amuse-bouches: a briny sea urchin ice cream topped with little bits of sweet mango, alongside peppery radishes. Kostow's flavors are so carefully woven together and meticulously presented that the savory courses end up looking like dessert. Or maybe I should say his desserts look like savory courses. While the main courses were flawless, the sweets left us a tad unsatisfied, and for the first time I felt like flavor had been sacrificed for presentation.
About 16 states now require people convicted of driving with blood-alcohol levels over the 0.08 legal limit to install so-called alcohol interlocks in their vehicles. These clunky systems require drivers to blow into a tube to verify that they are sober before the car can start. Nobody in the auto industry is proposing to offer such systems as factory-installed equipment. Instead, sensors would be unobtrusive, perhaps embedded in a starter button or a shift lever.

Fellow co-chairwoman Trudy Sargent said the board will cut teachers now, rather than spend from savings to protect jobs, because the risk of further state funding cuts during the school year is too high. Spending $16 million from reserves, but no more, as the board plans, "is prudent at this point."

In a brief interview with The Associated Press minutes after the vote, Lamothe said he would tackle Haiti's extreme poverty, rebuild public buildings that collapsed in the quake, restore the population's confidence in the government and move the 400,000-plus people displaced by the earthquake who remain in makeshift settlements.
TRUSCOTT: I'll remind you that four years ago at this point, Hillary Clinton was an odds-on favorite and Barack Obama was barely on the radar screen. Issues, social media and an angry public have changed all the dynamics. Michigan is at the crossroads of these dynamics. But remember, polling in a primary is a difficult proposition, and I predict the media will be writing about a Romney resurgence later this week.

The relationship with the team invigorated Coughlin. It was funny to see the contrast between him and Patriots coach Bill Belichick in the days leading up to the game.

It is time to revisit the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights; it has been noticeably absent in this crisis in Sanford. In the great legacy of Theodore Hesburgh and Mary Frances Berry, I would appeal to the president to take this opportunity to reconstruct and revitalize the commission and charge it once more with investigating discriminatory practices, rousing public concern and forcing the pace of reform.

It's not that the machines don't emit radiation. By all accounts, they do. But as Pistole reiterated in my conversation with him, those organizations had indeed assessed the devices and "all found that the radiation from these machines are well within the acceptable safety limits." That does not dissuade James Babb, a local man who is cofounder of the group We Won't Fly, who told me in an interview that the same Johns Hopkins report asserted that because so many millions of Americans would be scanned, somebody was bound to get cancer as a result.
For the most part, though, the Buffalo-based student and mother of two says she is no different from thousands of other people across North America and Mexico who have become absorbed in an effort called the Lost Ladybug Project, which Cornell University entomologist John Losey started 12 years ago to document the insects and determine why some species are declining.

Red Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk missed a dozen games down the stretch, but such is his lethality on the ice he was still recognized as one of the NHL's best two-way forwards.
Every elementary-school kid knows corn was the most important food in the Americas. The Popul Vuh, the Maya "bible," attributes humankind's very existence to this domesticated strain of wild grass. In its creation myth, the "Creators and Makers" fashioned man from tender kernels of yellow and white corn after failed attempts with mud and wood. Though corn was a dietary staple in most of Mexico as long as 6,000 years ago, it was the Maya who first cultivated it around 2500 B.C., abandoning their nomadic ways to settle in villages surrounded by cornfields.

The effect: One of the coolest tools in my camera bag has to be the macro lens. I use a 100mm Canon that is one of my sharpest lenses. The trick to shooting with the macro lens is getting down low -- and I mean really low, like on your stomach, because most of the really fun nature stuff that looks good in macro is only a few inches off the ground. It also helps if you have a tripod with legs that swing way out and go almost flat. My carbon fiber Gitzo GT 1830 has levers that release the legs to swing to almost 90 degrees.

An obvious source of inspiration lies in 17th- and 18th-century European botanical prints, which are often bizarre and stylized but always highly colored. Kanevsky's other references are more personal and obscure. He cites Harvard University's glass-flower collection at its Museum of Natural History as an inexhaustible cache of ideas, for form, content and sheer brazen originality. Carl Fabergé's flowers set in rock-crystal vases (less well known than the eggs) are another. "They are very poetic, just simple flowers, almost weeds," Kanevsky says. "I try to create this kind of effect in my work too, with something humble like a dandelion."

Perhaps most impressive is how Verlander has shown he has it when he most needs it. No matter the pitch count, he always seems to have the ability to reach back and hit three-digits. He is a four-pitch guy through most of the game, throwing his fastball at 92-93 mph, along with his changeup, curve and slider. But around inning seven, Verlander has shown the ability to, in effect, become his own closer.

Making the music choices interesting are the stories behind them. Some make deep connections to the songs, others love the beat, and then there are guys like Kaz Matsui who walk backward into a perfect fit. No, he'd never heard of Run DMC's "It's Tricky," but it worked like magic during the Rockies' 2007 season World Series run.
Still, others weren't so impressed.
Parise on whether he'll give a pregame speech: "I'm sure everyone will give their two cents and their opinion. We'll all make sure our linemates and teammates are ready to play. We've got plenty of guys capable of doing that. But we actually have to do it."
Which one's for dinner tonight? That's a tough call — one's flavor is simple and direct, the other is more complex and comforting. And the really great thing is, now that these frittatas are so easy to make, I no longer have to choose.
"I've got to assume that most of these large high rises are appealing their taxes because they're receiving quotes from the city that are higher than what they're actually worth," he said. "Sales that have occurred in the last couple of years have not supported the values the city is putting out."

The sixth-seeded Li used powerful groundstrokes to compile a 31-12 edge in winners, and won the last nine points of the match, a run that began when the fifth-seeded Schiavone was flustered by a line call she was sure was wrong.

I feel disgust. That Obama thinks a comedian who has been slammed by Hispanics in the past for his sexist and stereotypical humor and a "Desperate Housewives" star who is currently under fire for coproducing a television show called "Devious Maids" are appropriate conduits to Hispanic voters pretty much says it all.
The takeaway: The Musketeers have won just eight of their past 15 games. They are holding their opponents to 39.8 percent field-goal shooting, ranking 28th in the nation. Point guard Tu Holloway has a big-play reputation, and he gets scoring help from guard Mark Lyons (15.5 ppg). Kenny Frease (9.6 ppg), at 7-0, helps around the basket at both ends of the court. Guard/forward Dezmine Wells (10.3 ppg, 5 rpg) has had a solid freshman season. Holloway plays 36.5 minutes per game, among the nation's leaders.

Turns out that there's a "flat tire" rule, and airlines are known to cut their passengers some slack if they can't make it to the airport through no fault of their own. (Seems fair, given that we're pretty understanding when their planes break down.) I thought the rule had been phased out, but I'm told it's still unofficial policy at some airlines, including US Airways. Had de Pascht politely invoked that rule with the reservations agent or the agent's supervisor, she might have been able to rebook her flight at no charge.

The jet was doomed, the Russian probe determined, when, flying 16 feet above the ground and attempting to climb, its left wing struck a foot-thick birch tree trunk. The impact sheared off a third of the wing, which landed 121 yards from the tree, the Russians found. The loss of the wing tip caused the plane to dip sharply left, though it continued a slight climb. As the aircraft rolled, the stub of its left wing plowed into the ground, digging a deep trench. The fuselage flipped upside-down and ripped apart.
"Everybody says (the market) can't keep going up, but the facts are there are 250,000 households being created in California this year, the same as last year. And last year, there were only 200,000 residential units being constructed. As long as there is that imbalance, plus the demographics, prices are going to continue to rise,'' Gillespie said.

Meanwhile, the president who runs, or claims to have run, on a specific platform risks over-interpreting the election results. Recall George W. Bush a couple of days after his 2004 re-election. "You asked do I feel free.

The capital turned out to be inadequate to either task.

Now, less than nine months later, it occurred to Warden as he gazed down the city's deserted streets that the quiet could well just be the calm before the storm. One could imagine that the cinders from the previous summer's fires were in fact still smoldering, merely waiting for the right spark to set them off. By now he knew the stories. How the afternoon after the police raid on the blind pig, the Tigers had taken the field for a doubleheader against the New York Yankees.
