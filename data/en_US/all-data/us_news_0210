Republicans argue that the practice of "fast-gaveling" immediate effect motions without taking a roll call vote is well established in the House, and they say that Democrats employed the same procedure to authorize immediate effect for 744 of 761 bills adopted in the 2009-10 session, when Democrats held a 66-43 majority.
A: At this point, there's really not much else you can do. It appears you've tried to help and he simply resists it. If he fails the class, make him attend summer school. I bet next time he won't think twice about completing an assignment. -- Joel E. in Arlington, Texas
"There's no question that our schools deserve greater attention and investment, but resources shouldn't be wasted on programs that simply do not work," Bonney said in a written statement.

Not many company bosses toss $2,500 into a cash machine to reward employees for hard work. National Title Network chief executive Paula Pautauros does it 12 times a year, giving workers 30 seconds to grab as many bills as they can. The record haul was $978 at the 2-year-old firm.
The Painted Wall involved 26 pitches, a pitch being the distance the lead climber ascends before belaying his partner. The fastest climbing is done when a team's pitches are as long as their rope, about 150 feet.

The Nuggets would likely acquire forwards Derrick Favors and Troy Murphy and two first-round picks from the Nets in potential deal. Under one scenario, New Jersey would send point guard Devin Harris to the Blazers. The roadblock is that the Nuggets also covet the Blazers’ Nicolas Batum, and Portland officials have shown no interest in trading their versatile young forward. Other players and draft picks could also be involved. Spears also says the Nets inquired about Miller during the preseason.
The irony in comparing Adler (1914-2001) to today's jazz "harmonicists," such as Messrs. Thielemans, Meurkens and Maret, is that Adler was an American who specialized in the European classical repertoire (his signature performance of "Clair de Lune" embarrassed most pianists). Conversely, these living jazz masters are all European, from Belgium, Switzerland and Germany, respectively.

It must have been that evening that I heard the word 'lonesome' spoken in tones that let me know the privilege attached to it, the kind of democratic privilege that comes with simple deserving. ... In modern culture these are seen as pathologies — alienation and inauthenticity in Europe, maladjustment and depression in the United States. ... I am vehemently grateful that ... I learned to assume that loneliness should be in part pleasure, sensitizing and clarifying ... when I see a man or a woman alone, he or she looks mysterious to me, which is to say ... I see another human being clearly.
Confused? That's part of the fun of it. An example of the territory Kaufman is exploring: In one scene, a real-estate agent shows Hazel a house she's interested in. The only problem is that it's on fire. The house is perfect, Hazel says, except for the nagging fear that she might burn to death. Well, the agent chirpily responds, that is something to think about. The house continues to burn for years.

"I want to trigger that belief and extend it, to trigger a feeling of wonder that connects people to the natural world, to see a person like themselves as a wild animal," says Willers.

January, helped by consumers' improving assessment of the job market. Analysts had expected a reading of 63. The February reading marks the highest level since February 2011 when it was 72.0. The index is still far below the 90 that indicates a healthy economy.
But the House, which planned to begin a two-week recess later Thursday, had given the Senate little choice -- the government's authority to spend money on transportation programs and levy federal fuel taxes expires on Saturday, leaving no time for a tug-of-war between the two chambers.
There are, of course, other challenges that face these places beyond coming to an agreement on immigration issues. The median household income here, about $34,000, is a good $3,000 below the national county average. The poverty rate, 14 percent, is 3 percent above the national average. And nearly one in five people in these counties lives in a mobile home - despite the fact that a three-bedroom, 1�� bathroom house can be had in old El Mirage for under $100,000, often for under $50,000.

One's enjoyment of "The Fairy" depends a lot on knowing why it's worth seeing. It's a comedy with two or three big laughs, but it's not side-splitting.

Indeed, the fight over executive pay has evolved this year and moved to some new arenas:
In my experience, it seems as if boys are more favorable to their dads dating than girls. My sons were fine with me meeting and getting to know women, but my daughter picked apart every woman I introduced her to. She would be borderline rude to every date and sort of put them through the third degree, especially if they also had a daughter. The more one-on-one time I offered, the more she wanted. Once her mom remarried, things got worse instead of better. My ex-wife and I went to counseling with her and discovered she was afraid that she would be replaced should I get too serious about anyone and she would lose me all over again. The therapist suggested that I not introduce her to anyone I was dating unless we had been doing so for at least six months. When my daughter finally realized I wasn't going anywhere, she was easier to get along with and even looked forward to spending time with me and my girlfriend. - B.C. in Baltimore
While it is tough on hitters, Howell coach Tony Perkins is happy the new-found delivery is pretty easy on Norton.
Hugh Sisson, general partner of Heavy Seas Beer in Halethorpe, is working with state legislators to refine the growler law in Baltimore.

"It's really hard to say," he said. "I can't keep getting flagrant fouls. I'm giving up a lot of money. So, you know, no one else is going out there taking hard fouls or standing up for themselves. The fight has to be within everybody, it can't be just a few guys. It ain't just about hard fouls. It's about how much you're going to take. I'm tired of getting hammered every night. It's 30-plus, 40 points. That's embarrassing."
Don Marrandino, eastern regional president for Caesars Entertainment, which owns four of Atlantic City's 11 casinos, says the resort is working hard to redefine itself.
And, as Denver tightened things late, closing to within four points, what was the crowd chanting then? What was on their minds? “We want tacos!” The reference was to a promotion the Lakers have where the fans can receive free tacos from a fast-food chain.

HITTING: Adam Melker was 3-for-4 with a run scored. ... Victor Sanchez 2-for-4. ... Outfielder and rising prospect Oscar Taveras doubled. It's possible to see Taveras as a top-15 prospects and perhaps more if he has a solid season this year and includes time as a starter with a full-season club. His invitation to the mini-camp the Cardinals had at the start of spring was indicative of how they feel he could echo last year's breakout in Johnson City. ... Catcher

Analysts estimate the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.7 percent in the April-June quarter, held back by weak consumer spending and high unemployment.
The wild chef behind these festive mountains of food is Martin Picard, whose Au Pied de Cochon in the city has been a sensation for its unsubtle dishes, such as pig's trotters stuffed with foie gras. As a defender of Quebecois cuisine, Picard bought a place in suburban St-Benoit de Mirabel a few years ago and turned it into his own version of a cabane a sucre, or sugar shack, where syrup producers mark the season with maple-drenched meals. And his is no fake: On-site production of maple syrup is supervised by his uncle, Marc, and the liquid gold works its way into just about every dish, as does Picard's sense of playfulness — and unbridled excess. (If you think that this man knows, or cares, about the meaning of "over the top," consider the fact that he piles his fried-sturgeon sushi with pork rinds, and he sprinkles those with flecks of gold leaf.)

One would also think it would serve as a great narrative for the White House to use in a fall campaign against Romney. But not so fast. Painting Romney’s Bain Capital as a one-stop chop shop isn’t going to be as easy as many of President Obama’s supporters might expect.

Arechiga was leading a tour of the top-secret “cheese cave” at Valley Shepherd Creamery in Long Valley.

To put it on the spectrum of films that have sprung from the Sparks canon of weepy romance novels, it's not as good as "The Notebook" but not as bad as "Nights in Rodanthe."

Those polls also show that younger people tend to be far more accepting of gay marriage than anyone else, and maybe that's the key for Obama. He needs millennials (who voted for him by a three-to-one margin in 2008) to come out big in November if he's going to be re-elected.

And he was apologizing a year earlier after FSM botched the most anticipated moment of that home opener, the controversial return of Mark McGwire to the team after having admitted to using performance-enhancers during his now-tainted run to the single-season home run title in 1998. The focus that day was how McGwire would be received by the fans, but just as the Cards' new hitting coach was to be introduced FSM cut to reporter Jim Hayes talking to reserve outfielder Joe Mather. That led some fans to think it was cover-up in case McGwire was booed.

But such efforts do little to stem the inflow of youths who don't even belong in detention centers. Between 40 percent to 50 percent of the roughly 230 youths detained at Cheltenham and the Baltimore facility at any given time are there because they are awaiting placement in a group home, substance abuse program or other type of treatment plan, not because they have been sentenced to remain there, the report found. Detention centers are considered the last option for treatment because they are expensive and don't tailor care to individual youths' needs.

At some point, and hopefully before someone suffers a devastating injury, the athletes and their leagues will begin to seriously address the machismo culture in their respective professions.

"It's unbelievable," said Freese, the only Cardinals player to hit safely in each game of the team's 5-1 start. "You're going to win a ton of ballgames if your starters keep doing what they're doing.

But holding interest rates steady is a small gesture in the face of mounting student debt, which was expected to hit the $1 trillion mark this week. Policymakers, colleges and students themselves must work to make higher education more affordable and avoid high debt levels.
Still, with the SSS caveat in full effect, there is a bit of history in play for the local nine. The Cardinals are off to a 9-3 start through 12 games, and it is arguably the best start for a Cardinals club since 1900. According to historian Tom Orf and his magical, mystical database of Cardinals history, this club's pitching staff has more strikeouts than all but five previous previous teams, only one club has fewer walks allowed through the first 12 games of a season, and no team -- not one since 1900 -- has had a better run differential through 12 games. Orf said he had to dig back to 1888 to find a higher run differential.

Smith: The only answer -- well, this city needs to have a commitment to keep open our major art institutions. Additional money out of the general fund during times of budget cuts should not be our first move. The mayor can play a role not only in having the city give taxpayer dollars but also in helping to identify and find additional private giving or givers. That's a move before taking money out of the general fund. Taking money out of the general fund should not be off the table, but you also want to be careful about the moral hazard of saying: "Sure, the city will cover if private donors stop giving." Because you don't want to make it seem like private donors don't have to give.

"I love these guys. But they are totally full of crap," he said. "The pressure is on us. Wichita is in the NCAA Tournament already. I don't really see the pressure on them.

In the top of a double boiler, melt chocolate and butter, stirring occasionally, until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool.
The story that former Cardinals manager Tony La Russa likes to tell is that Albert Pujols was on the field and Mark McGwire was in the dugout, looming behind the manager and providing shadow with his size. It was 2001. The game was during spring training. And Pujols had just done something else remarkable. Maybe it was an extra-base hit. Maybe it was a line-drive RBI single. Maybe it was advancing the runner.
In the seventh, Windsor's Lauren Snodgrass reached on an infield single and should have gone to third on Caitlin Tufts' infield single that spun into foul ground, but she missed second base. A simple fielder's choice, followed by Elle Madsen's eighth of 10 strikeouts, ended the threat.

Thunder win again: Oklahoma City dispatched Sacramento 120-112 to match the Lakers' 55 wins, but the Thunder (55-26) need help to move up from the No. 4 spot and a first-round date with Denver.

øAs for those not looking forward to another defensive slugfest, Saban countered, "Two great defensive teams, no doubt. … There are so many good players on both sides for both teams …I think there's a lot of opportunity for the game to be completely different and have a completely different flavor from what the first game did."

Of course, it's only natural to prefer the devil we know -- and like for the wrong reasons -- but the costs of too much backslapping, first-name calling and uncritical support often outweigh the benefits. The prospects of Musharraf leaving office in Pakistan were so unsettling that we failed to prepare for his inevitable fall. And in the Middle East, we could not comprehend the rise of Hamas in Gaza over our chosen partner, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas.

Clemens surely knows what they are, because his life hasn't been the same since McNamee exposed him as a juicer before Congress and he denied it all.

But the measure doesn't survive the practicality test. San Francisco's garbage system works fine as a regulated monopoly. So well, in fact, that its recycling and composting methods are a national model. City Hall has pushed hard to divert 78 percent of the city's waste from dumps with a goal of 100 percent by 2020. Also, in a notoriously high-cost town, the rates aren't exorbitant.
Perhaps the reason there were no eblasts about this robbery is that, like the Roland Park woman who was held up, no one wanted to create a stir. Like other city residents, Roland Parkers chose to live and pay exorbitantly high taxes in Baltimore City. If Roland Parkers did not support the city, even in a time of huge challenges for a beleaguered city, they would move. More “for sale” signs would pop up.

Barry, as someone who claims to be devoted to the separation of church and state, surely you can agree that exempting churches from taxes is a better way to separate state and church than taxing them.

But lost in the sputter and griping is a key fact: A majority of the House Tea Party Caucus came his way. In exchange, they won a vote later this year for a balanced budget amendment, and they can't be blamed for any tax hikes because, with Boehner's lead, they agreed to none.

Chef Stefan Sabo, a native of Germany who worked at the Manor in West Orange and the Bernards Inn in Bernardsville, offers a seasonal menu that is impeccably executed. Using short ribs instead of the traditional pot roast for the sauerbraten ($29) gives the dish a richer flavor, enhanced by potato gnocchi standing in for spaetzle, and marinated red cabbage that hits exactly the right note. An Oktoberfest beer jus adds the appropriate touch for a standout dish.

Collins, a product of the political organization of former Ald. Ed Smith (28th), said she has the endorsements of Senate President John Cullerton (D-Chicago) and Gov. Pat Quinn. The governor showed up at a late-January fund-raiser on her behalf and tabbed her to carry his proposed constitutional amendment to enable voters to petition to get ethics initiatives on the ballot. "The fact he'd try to get her to carry a bill like that for him, a constitutional amendment, is strange to me," Van Pelt Watkins said of Quinn. "For one thing, she has a series of lapses in ethics."

Exceptions are rare—Cher scored No. 1 singles more than 33 years apart ("I Got You Babe" in 1965 and "Believe" in 1999). Louis Armstrong managed to keep adding hits to his catalog throughout his long career.

"General Shali," as President Clinton often referred to him, counseled Clinton on the use of troops during conflicts in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Haiti, Rwanda and other places. When he appointed Shalikashvili chairman of the Joint Chiefs in 1993, Clinton lauded the general as "a soldier's soldier, a proven warrior, a creative and flexible visionary."
There has been plenty of great pop that blithely mines past glories. But the mimeographed approach Gaga takes on "Born This Way" completely contradicts the amped-up (and self-righteous) empowerment rhetoric of her lyric. Even as she’s lifting ideas from world-famous Madonna records, Lady Gaga is telling you to express your individuality. Stefani Germanotta, why not express some of your own?

Finally, the man in the row behind us, a tall, beefy guy who easily had 50 pounds over my husband, stood up, put his hands on the back of my husband's seat, and screamed at the top of his lungs, "SHUT UP!"

Sweet potatoes are native to the tropics from the Yucatán to Venezuela, and the Maya domesticated the plant at least 5,000 years ago. By 2500 B.C., sweet potatoes had spread throughout the Caribbean and South America. Sweet potatoes belong to the genus Ipomoea, which includes morning glories. Though commonly confused with the yam, what we know as yams are simply another variety of sweet potato. True yams are native to Africa; when slaves from that continent were deposited in North America they adopted sweet potatoes as a substitute for the tuber they had eaten in their homeland and called it by the familiar name.

Add to that the knowledge that the so-called pink slime is composed of mechanically-separated beef trimmings -- parts of the cow that once were only used for dog food, not human consumption.

Why is the House of Representatives' vote to require a balanced budget such an empty gesture? ("Cut, cap and empty gesture," July 20.) This is what millions of American families do when hard times knock on their door. They cut their spending, they cap their future budgets, and they attempt to work within their means. This is what The Sun says is an empty gesture? The Sun's grasp on reality is, at best, questionable.

I hadn't rented in more than two years and this one had eluded my attention. And it illuminates the degree to which the rental companies' CDW is inflated. You can bet that those third-party insurance companies are not losing money on their $9 to $11 coverage rates, so about two-thirds of the rental companies' daily CDW charges are pure gravy. No wonder they push it so hard.
