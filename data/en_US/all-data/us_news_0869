Judging by the vocal French dueling behind me, there seemed some question about its status as a masterpiece. And what to make of Hungarian artist Gyula Halasz's photographs? Between 1932 and 1956 he tracked down a group of urban petroglyphs hacked into the industrial concrete of Europe's inner cities. Like Richier, 20th century taggers produced a series of skulls that Halasz's photographs turned into art. The more art changes the more it stays the same, a lesson learned under the big top of the Pompidou-Metz.

When you are recovering from a brain injury, you see the world in a different way and feel a lot different than your former normal, especially in the beginning, so it is valuable for TBI survivors to get to relate to their new people. I attended one "Brainstormers" meeting at the North Portland hospital the weekend before my "Think Out Loud" appearance to learn what I could about the brain-injured community.

"I used to think that Mia was some kind of superhero. That her boundless energy and joy was completely without effort in every moment and that nothing could infringe on that," Porter says.

So, some of us are intrigued by what recently happened in Cleveland. It seems someone using the alias "lawmiss" had posted provocative comments and scathing personal attacks on the Web site of the Cleveland Plain Dealer. Some of those comments and attacks evinced an unlikely familiarity with cases being heard by a local judge, Shirley Strickland Saffold. When lawmiss made a comment about the mental state of a reporter's relative, the paper decided to trace the nickname. It found that the postings came from Judge Saffold's personal e-mail account.

For Silent Knight, who was named one of AllHipHop.com's Top 25 underground artists of 2011, that's a good thing. As his album title proclaims, "Busy Is My Best Friend." It might just as well be the motto for Jersey hip-hop artists, who say hip-hop culture persists in the Garden State, though staying both busy and heard is not easy. Over the river and across the city in Brooklyn, says Silent Knight, "Everywhere you look there's a show and a bar."
Sure, it may seem like it's a case of kicking people when they're down. After all, Jon and Kate Gosselin have had their share of hardship in the last several weeks: allegations that Jon cheated with a 23-year-old schoolteacher and that Kate is everything from a money-hungry power freak to a manipulative schemer and a cheater herself. Amidst reports of their disintegrating marriage, the fifth season of their increasingly popular TLC reality show aired, and the strain on them was clearly evident: paparazzi stood at a distance and photographed their sextuplets' outdoor birthday party while Jon and Kate barely exchanged a word. It was all so riveting, 10 million of us tuned in to watch.

"I had a lot of different musical influences early on," Little said. "I was in a fife and drum corps, which is a strange thing to run through your veins for someone born in 1978 in New Jersey. But I feel connected to the tradition of classical music, even if I grew up playing rock and metal. The funny thing is that certain parts of Bach, Mozart and, especially, Beethoven are so punk in my mind."

The Ricks Centre is a restored 1946 Art Deco/Art Moderne-style building that began life as the Weil Theater, serving as a concert hall and movie theater.

Frisman Jackson, WR, Browns: Yes, I've actually received emails asking if I think Jackson is for real.

Walter Pilling. My German friend. I'd written about you some time ago when we went to Oktoberfest at the Phoenix Club. You used to have a Westfalia identical to mine. On Friday, you brought me a spare taillight lens, a bottle of smoked beer from Bamberg and, most precious, a custom tool you'd made for adjusting VW engine valves. You are a machinist by trade. You also have one less thumb than the last time I saw you. Most machinists lose digits to the lathe or band saw. You retired from Beckman with all of yours intact - only to lose one late in life to cancer. There's irony.

On the other hand, Union Station is in downtown, where you don't find a lot of free parking. And it's not too far from other major entertainment venues downtown -- Busch Stadium, Scottrade Center, the Peabody Opera House, etc. So if it did have a free parking lot, Cardinals and Blues fans might end up using it a lot (to the chagrin of other parking lot attendants around town).

Watch Harrison in the weight room, her shoulder-length blond hair pulled back in a ponytail and her face flush and bathed in sweat, and it's hard not to be impressed by her work ethic. Although she's put on more than 30 pounds in the last four years, little of that is fat, leaving her with the chiseled upper body and sculpted biceps of a middleweight boxer. That strength allows her to fight standing up and moving forward, avoiding the lazy "drop and flop" style many female judo athletes fall into.

"Old Town School runs programs in 17 schools," Graves said. "It's almost all grant-funded work. Last year for 17 schools we had more than 100 schools that applied. There's a lot more demand for it that we can fulfill. It kind of breaks your heart that our teachers, who are with students 18 weeks a year, are the only exposure they've got in music or dance.

Folks, if you're going to do a movie about an illness - a serious one that kills lots of people every year - have respect for the people who've been through the experience. Respect their fear and suffering. Don't have Kate Hudson look more and more radiant the sicker she gets. Don't portray being battered by chemotherapy as something on the order of a hangover.

What pushes THE FOURTH WAR over the top of being just a mediocre Cold War film are the leads mesmerizing performances. Scheider’s Colonel Knowles visibly teeters on the edge of sanity; his longing for a fight and near childish desire to pick on his enemy shows as plain as day on his face. Likewise, Prochnow’s Valachev is a picture perfect representation of the cold icy enemy Scheider wants to take down. His no nonsense, single-minded determination is the opposite side of the crazy coin shared by his foe. THE FOURTH WAR is an okay, fun little movie on its own, but the director and the lead actors make it something far more enjoyable and engrossing.

But the view that Romney is inevitably going to be the Republican nominee wasn’t hard to spot in his victory speech in Milwaukee as the former Massachusetts governor did not make a single reference to his Republican competitors and focused on President Obama’s record in office.

But instead of falling on it, two Chargers tried running with it, and Franklin recovered it.
When ex-newspaper reporter Ray Dudgeon first appeared in last year's debut "Big City, Bad Blood" (somebody should have been shot for that title), the Chicago private eye had a rough time of it.

Dudgeon does face lies, threats and manipulation trying to find out the truth why the daughter of an Army Intelligence colonel dies.

Sadly over last few decades what we have seen is an erosion of the significance of the father's role in the family. The father is at the core of stability for a family unit, along with the mother and children. When fathers are given their proper respect and admiration, in the process we also teach our young boys what their role will be as future fathers. Fathers have the obligation to provide for the family but that is not the only "function" they serve. They act as teachers, helpers, and offer a shoulder of support during a family's tough times. In the Islamic tradition, Muslims are commanded to respect their parents: "And We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents..... Quran (46:15)

An appeal to the state Employee Relations Board would be limited. Under state statute, the three-member panel cannot determine whether the arbitrator made the right decision. Instead, the board must decide whether there are any grounds for an appeal -- for example, did the arbitrator consider all pertinent evidence, exceed her power, base the ruling on a material mistake, or did the ruling violate public policy or law?
