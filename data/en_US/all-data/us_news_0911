Amazon's shares trade at about 130 times last year's earnings, which Reeves aptly described as "nosebleed" territory. Investors treat it as a stock with explosive growth potential, even though its profit margins have declined and revenue increases have tailed off.

Nah. Instead, Brown got away with blaming California's dysfunction on the Republican "cult" in Sacramento.

President Obama's "evolution" of his thinking on gay marriage is nothing more than a desperate attempt to look relevant and stay in the headlines.

The 1999 MVP was a feared hitter -- a tough out even when he got to the big leagues as a 19-year-old, and in ’99 he hit 35 homers, the most ever by an AL catcher -- and had one of the best arms ever behind the plate (I think it was the best, but I saw Johnny Bench only on TV). When Larry Parrish managed the Tigers, he told me that Rodriguez saved the Rangers one run per game with his arm, not just by stopping runners from stealing bases but because the threat of a pickoff kept runners anchored within a few feet of first or second base, which regularly allowed them to advance only one base, not two. A run a game sounds like a lot but Parrish was on to something. Because of Rodriguez, Jorge Posada was one conversation away from becoming a Ranger in 1997. Rodriguez’s contract was up at the end of that season and the Rangers were going to trade him if they hadn’t signed him to an extension. Doug Melvin had worked out a Posada deal with the Yankees and was about to pull the trigger when Rodriguez walked into his office on July 31 to see if they could compromise. They did, agreeing to a deal before agent Jeff Moorad could arrive from California, and the Posada trade was off.

Florida and the 25 other states say the law goes too far in coercing them into participating by threatening a cutoff of federal money. The states contend that the vast expansion of the joint federal-state Medicaid program and the requirement that employers offer health insurance violate the Constitution. No appeals court has agreed.

CARNEY: The President is interested in helping the American people, helping the American consumer. I mean, this is one -- this, to me, is -- and, I believe, to him -- is just a no-brainer.

Not that the U.S. can claim any kind of moral purity in this regard.

The U.S. also took too long to establish procedures by which inmates could challenge their confinement with the assistance of an advocate and with the right to introduce "reasonably available evidence." In offering support and advice, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the U.S. should press the Afghans to afford their countrymen similar due process. The Afghan government must treat prisoners with dignity and abide by international norms.

If the containment vessel is not breached and the fuel has not melted, then the fuel assembly could ultimately be replaced and the reactor restarted in a process analogous to refueling the reactor. But that might require complete replacement of all the plumbing in the reactor if pipes have been damaged by the seawater. In that case, it might be cheaper to start over. If the fuel has melted partially, or perhaps even completely, without damaging the containment vessel, the reactor would have to be decommissioned. Most likely, the company would keep pumping seawater through it for several years until it had cooled down sufficiently and many of the radioactive isotopes had decayed enough that engineers could go in and remove the fuel. That, in essence, is what happened in 1979 in the partial core meltdown at the Three Mile Island Generating Station in Pennsylvania. Workmen eventually dug out the partially melted fuel and buried it at a disposal site in Idaho. The empty containment vessel now stands next to functioning reactors at the site.

As if this child had any choice. Much of her mother's short political career, and virtually all of her appeal as a vice-presidential candidate, are staked on her opposition to a woman's right to an abortion.

Chongqing's new leaders have launched a "cleanup" of government investment projects, one local financial official said—projects that helped to propel the megacity's growth to the fastest in China and put Mr. Bo on track to be considered for a senior national leadership position.

It would cut retirement payouts or make firefighters work longer careers to get them in several ways: by reducing annual pension increases earned after 25 years of work; by changing pension calculations to an average of the firefighter's last three years of pay instead of last two years; and by ending the practice of returning tens of thousands of dollars in firefighters' accumulated pension contributions when they leave the department.

Most relaxing place: Lanai. After three hectic days in Honolulu, I fled for a weekend to the old pineapple island. During a visit more than a decade before, the place had left me cold. On that trip, I had followed the normal tourist route of staying at the two luxury resorts – now the Four Seasons Lodge at Koele in the upcountry and the Four Seasons Manele Bay down by the ocean. To get around, I rode the shuttle bus that hit the resorts and Lanai City, the old plantation town that is the center of local activity. The resorts, especially Manele Bay, were very nice, but I felt like I was in a bubble, disconnected from island life. I was in no hurry to return. Fourteen years later, I did. This time I stayed at the only other hotel, the tiny Hotel Lanai, a restored plantation-style building that had once been the guest house for Dole Pineapple Co. executives and visitors. From my porch, I could look out through the pine trees at Lanai City life. Best of all, I rented a Jeep and kicked up red dust from one end of the island to the other. Now I can't wait to go back.

The Warriors lacked three core players in their starting lineup, including Stephen Curry, David Lee and Andrew Bogut. They're not exactly mailing-in performances. But by losing 15 games of their last 23, the team's not exactly sweating the fact they're playing young players since every dropped game gives them a better chance at striking a high lottery pick.

Why he makes sense: Zeitler had been projected to go in the first half of the second round, but some draftniks now say he could sneak into the first round. Do the Ravens like him enough to take him there? Or would they maybe try to slide back then draft him? Only those inside the Castle know, but he would immediately compete with Jah Reid for the starting left guard spot and quiet some of the concern about the departure of Ben Grubbs.
Three of the team’s current linebackers – Jameel McClain, Albert McClellan and Dannell Ellerbe – joined the team after going undrafted, and have developed well enough that the Ravens once again did not select an inside linebacker to potentially replace Ray Lewis.

There will be tough days ahead in Nash's campaign. Opponents of his order have filed an appeal and are seeking a stay to block it while they pursue that appeal. Moreover, Nash's order, for tactical reasons, decrees that the press — but not the public — has a direct interest in the workings of the court and thus deserves the presumption of access. That puts off two questions for later: What about the general public? And who, exactly, is a member of the press?

'He always talks about it,' Baron Davis said before the Bobcats game Thursday night. 'He always references the Pistons and what they were about.

Go whale watching. From early December through mid-April, Hawaii's waters are graced by the majestic kohola, or humpback whales. These gentle mammals can be easily spotted slapping tails, blowing spouts and breaching. You can watch from the beach, from many places where the highway runs near the ocean (there's usually a line of cars pulled over when whales are offshore) or from the deck of a sailboat. One of the best whale-watching cruise companies is Ocean Sports (http://www.hawaiioceansports.com), which also offers dolphin watching and snorkel cruises year-round. With five marine biologists on staff, one of whom sails with each cruise, an Ocean Sports adventure is as educational as it is fun.

Speaking of drollery, one of the car's backers, Ray Lane—formerly of Oracle, now a managing partner with the mega-VC outfit Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, in charge of green tech—told me on the phone some months ago the Karma would have performance comparable to the best GT sedans out there. Alas, not even close. In the all-electric Stealth mode—with a full charge, a range of between 32 miles (says the EPA) and 50 miles (Fisker)—the Karma accelerates to 60 in 7.9 seconds on its leisurely way to a 95-mph top speed. That's perfectly adequate in daily driving—during my 70-mile test drive through the hills of Malibu, the car never felt at a disadvantage in traffic—but it ain't bottled lightning either.

"Mother's Day"—Inspired by the 1980 Troma slasher flick of the same name, this is notable for a chilling lead performance from Rebecca De Mornay and not much else. The home-invasion thriller from director Darren Lynn Bousman (who made the second, third and fourth "Saw" movies as well as one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life, "Repo! The Genetic Opera") takes us through all the obligatory steps of the genre: Bad guys enter, assert their dominance and pick people off one by one. The hostages make futile attempts to attack or escape but their actions aren't as important as the structure itself, which serves as a crucible of human nature. That would be all well and good if the characters here were vaguely intriguing. They're not even cliched types—they're just sort of bland, and eventually they're bloody. That makes De Mornay's quietly commanding, creepy turn stand out even more. She stars as Mother, who steps in to clean things up when her idiot bank-robber sons (Patrick Flueger, Warren Kole and Matt O'Leary) botch a job and then try to hide in what they believe is their childhood home. Turns out Mother got foreclosed on, and the place now belongs to Beth (Jaime King) and Daniel (Frank Grillo), who were in the middle of a housewarming party. Gnarly, sadistic torture ensues. R for strong brutal bloody violence and torture, pervasive language and some sexual content. 112 minutes. Two stars out of four.

The second is that the world needs the U.S. and appreciates the role it plays. (In some versions of this argument, the world needs the U.S. far more than the U.S. needs the world.) If there have been no serious challenges to American hegemony to date, it is asserted, it is because the U.S. provides what are referred to by foreign policy analysts as "global goods": It maintains political and economic stability around the world, it guarantees a democratic capitalist world order and, by virtue of its unparalleled military strength, it acts as a world policeman of last resort.

To help effect the deal for "Intermission," SFMOMA is taking to auction a Hopper painting that it already owns, the 1939 "Bridle Path," a view of riders entering New York's Central Park that faintly foreshadows his mature style.

To be signed by Gov. Mark Dayton, the bill also will need to give the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) the authority to regulate minnows coming into the state from waters where Asian carp have been found.

The soft pillows of stark white cheese, topped by off-white macadamia slivers, are ringed by bright yellow olive oil. The cheese has the texture of the softest tofu and just a hint of tanginess from the goat's milk. Cut by a dash of pure olive flavor, complemented by the crunch of the nuts, with just a few flakes of sea salt on top, the cheese is transformed from something rich-tasting and farm-fresh into a rounded, subtle and complete dish.

In the face of competing research, some area school administrators say they rely on their own measures to weigh the effectiveness of their programs. And many are reporting positive results.
One might be tempted to lay blame for all this on the party's nominating process, with its mixture of elections and caucuses, winner-take-alls and proportionals, that are complicated and confusing. Or perhaps on an electorate so fickle that it changes preferences in a flash. But perhaps more alarmingly, it also speaks to the character of the men running for office: their egos, their obstinacy and their inability to see beyond their self-interest.
National Little League president Bill Hooper remembers Harvey "always smiling. He was a great athlete. As a 12-year-old he hit 15 homeruns, five of them grand slams."

"We're deeply concerned by continuing Israeli actions on settlements in the West Bank," the statement from the U.S. Embassy said. "As we said before, we view these settlements as illegitimate and as running counter to efforts to resume direct negotiations."
Former Browns coach Sam Rutgiliano, who had cast Ozzie Newsome as one of the first "receiving" tight ends 30 years ago, loved Winslow's hands. But they were not the equal of Newsome's. The mantra around town was that Winslow never dropped the ball, but Brady Quinn's only series of 2007 ended with a field goal, not a touchdown because of Winslow's drop. Quinn's fourth-and-short pass in the collapse against Denver went right through Winslow's hands, too. He had had a big game overall against the defenseless Broncos.

What do you think about the Bears going after Saints guard Carl Nicks in free agency? I know that guard is not a big position of need, but I think whenever you have an opportunity to acquire one of the three best players at his position in the entire league you should go for it -- especially when there's no compensation involved. Most teams have a similar philosophy in the draft -- if an elite player falls to you, you draft him regardless of position or need -- so why not use the same philosophy in free agency? -- Tom Davis, International Falls, Minn.

Despite the onslaught of higher bank fees in the past year, consumers scored a rare victory this week when Bank of America Corp. backpedaled on its plan to charge $5 a month for debit card purchases.

Some of these promises have been fulfilled, yet progress in most areas has been incremental and not necessarily attributable to Villaraigosa. Like past mayors, he has boosted the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department, yet also like past mayors he has been prevented by budget pressures from going as far as he wanted. He never succeeded in getting the control over schools he sought, and changes in the gang situation are hard to measure (L.A. gang killings rose 6% last year, but other gang-related crimes were down). The Department of Water and Power, meanwhile, remains stubbornly unaccountable to the public, Villaraigosa has cut fiscally damaging deals with public employee unions, and his skills as an administrator leave much to be desired.
