Once a year, Orange County chefs gather to turn the taco-themed charity fundraiser into an opportunity to create concoctions that are, well, wild and crazy. Off the beaten culinary path, the "tacos'' this year were filled with everything from alligator to lamb shanks, steak tartar to duck "fries" (yes, duck testicles).

Burning hot. You don't seriously believe Broncos executive John Elway is hurting inside after getting rid of quarterback Tim Tebow, do you? Seriously? That was the greatest day of Elway's life, and he couldn't care less about Tebow. He lied to Tebow and fans over and over again, and now we are supposed to believe a word that comes out of Elway's mouth? This is the thanks that Tebow gets for turning around a terrible team, taking the Broncos to the playoffs and then throwing for 316 yards against Pittsburgh?

In that sense, it's only fitting that "Woolgathering" should have emerged from the extended period of nearly total silence (1980-96) during which Smith lived in Michigan and raised two kids. What are parents if not woolgatherers? For Smith, however, writing the book served another purpose, offering a way out of what she calls "a terrible and inexpressible melancholy," in which she "would sit for hours, when my chores were done and the children at school, beneath the willows, lost in thought." It's hard to read those lines without thinking of Mapplethorpe, who had died a couple of years before. But even more, I think, "Woolgathering" is the expression of an artist sitting in the exact center of her life (she finished the book on her 45th birthday) and considering where she's been and where she wants to go.

"I just think he wanted to make more of a conscious effort to be in some of the meetings," Pettine said at the "Match for Michael" event. "He’s already been in some of our spring meetings, sat in on them and got lathered up, and all of a sudden had to jump up and go over a technique or something like that.

What is missing here is any true recognition that Cascade Locks has serious economic problems and that the community can choose to use its available resource to solve those problems. That's what we do. Local resident and state representative Mark Johnson was clear that using the excess water offered a high-value reward when viewed against the prospect that the community will, in the Sorensons' words, "dry up." This opportunity is confirmed by OSU professor Bruce Sorte, who estimates that the Nestlé plant "could close to double" the Cascade Locks economy. By using its abundant water resource, the community will again be able to fulfill its obligation to its children and citizens. How long will the relationship last? Who can say, although it is likely that Nestlé will only invest millions of dollars on plant, personnel and infrastructure if it plans to remain for some time.

The ram-air chutes, so named because slits on their leading edge let air rush in to create lift and high-speed forward movement, were a radical design shift when they appeared in the 1970s. Ram-air jumpers carve pinpoint turns by tugging down one side of the chute's trailing edge, like wiggling the aileron on a plane's tail. Yanking both sides at once tips the chute up in a speed-damping "flare," which makes for a super-soft landing.

His book about the murders masterminded by Charles Manson, "Helter Skelter," written with coauthor Curt Gentry, hasn't been out of print since it appeared in 1974. It's blurbed as the bestselling true-crime book of all time, at what Bugliosi figures is about 7 million copies. His 2007 JFK book, "Reclaiming History," got its start in a 1986 mock trial on television, in which Bugliosi prosecuted Lee Harvey Oswald, using actual assassination witnesses, and proved that Oswald alone killed the president. It has sold considerably fewer copies than "Helter Skelter," but, as he says, "if you want to make money, you don't put out a book that weighs 7 1/2 pounds and costs $57 and has over 10,000 citations and a million and a half words."
Yet Katrina plays only a small role in some of Spera’s portraits. “I don’t describe this as a ‘Katrina book’ at all,” says Spera, 43. “If you write about any New Orleanian’s life for the past six or seven years, Katrina’s going to factor into the story, so the storm definitely weaves through a lot of the narratives. But that’s not the point.”

"Exit Music" finds Rebus with 10 days left on the job. Taking stock of pending retirement, he doubts whether his old friends, "ciggies and booze and a little night music," will be enough comfort without the job. Certainly his grown daughter in England and an ex-wife in Italy won't be much help.
What could help schools deliver more would be out-of-the-box thinking, big innovations and novel use of the money they do have, he said.

Kitzhaber has shown himself to be thoughtful and courageous in reconsidering the executions he supported years ago. His reconsideration, one may hope, is only part of a developing process.

Boy, did it. The birth rate spike created a boom in the country unlike anything seen before. It would take a half-century to match the mark. Births jumped from 2.8 million in 1945 to 3.4 million in 1946. The babies kept coming, topping out at 4.3 million births in 1957 and staying over 4 million per year until 1965. In all, about 75 million boys and girls. Despite a much larger population, immigration and the "echo boom" of boomers children having children, the 1957 single-year mark wouldn't be surpassed until 2007, when there were 4.31 million births.

"We had summer in the spring and spring in the summer," said François Mitjaville, owner of Saint-Émilion's Château Tertre-Rôteboeuf, in reference to a year that saw temperatures rise to 30 degrees Celsius in April, hitting highs of 40 degrees Celsius in late June then plunging in July and August before a stormy Indian summer in September, which, in the case of the Cabernet Sauvignon variety, saved the vintage.

Of course, clothing reconstruction has been going on since the early days of punk, when safety pins were all the rage.

By keeping its currency undervalued, Brown said, China can flood open markets like America's and lure away American jobs.

Detroit Tigers radio broadcaster Jim Price, who has been battling health problems, did not accompany the team to Seattle. The club said it requested Price to stay behind.
The old adage "justice delayed is justice denied" rings true in this case. Both the Constitution and the Speedy Trial Act require us to focus on criminal cases, which means that civil cases may not get the attention they deserve if the other two branches do not fill judicial vacancies. We get many age, race, sex and disability discrimination cases. We also get complex business cases, and cases involving disputes between individuals or businesses and state and local governments or agencies. I have learned there is generally one side to a dispute which benefits from delay. If I don't make a decision, I am in effect tipping the scales of justice in that party's favor.

The next day, I asked my mom if she would drive me around the neighborhood. It was early spring, and weak sunlight filtered through the windshield. I squinted, unused to the light. My mom looked over at me and smiled. She had been begging me to do this for months, but I hadn't seen the point. Now I saw there was value in just leaving the house.
He developed some pretty admirable ways to cope with these limitations - instead of spending the mornings with a newspaper, for instance, he'd spend the evenings with the radio. He asked other people to write down his letters - my mother did this for him a lot when she was a child.

"I was a 22-year-old kid with blinders on," Nicklaus said. "People ask me about Arnold's backyard, Arnold's gallery. I never heard it. All I was doing was playing golf and trying to win a golf tournament. I looked back and said, 'Wow! Look what happened.' It's amazing that was my first win. Arnold treated me great. He couldn't have been nicer. He's always been that way with me."

Davis had been known as an emotional player during his time with the Boston Celtics, and he has displayed that emotion over and over again in this postseason.

The Cardinal had a bit of an awakening Saturday night, giving up shocking chunks of yardage, but it hardly mattered in a 65-21 thrashing of Washington before a sold-out crowd at Stanford Stadium. If you saw the game, and concluded that Andrew Luck has about two dozen explosive options within every huddle, it's because that's how it seemed to everyone on a warm, windless sampling of Indian summer.

"When you have one line going, it's too easy for the other team to shut your offense down," McDonald said. "So we really need contributions from our top six forwards. That's going to be the key for us going forward. We've got great goaltending, team defense, we're really strong. It's just going to be whether or not we can get that depth scoring we need - our top six and then the third line chipping in here and there for us. That's going to be the key."

Williams, ASU coach Tim Esmay said, was "vintage, really efficient (85 pitches). The best thing about Trevor was he didn't let the score dictate his outing. Early in the game he wasn't establishing first-pitch strikes. He got back into that and when he did the game was over."

The lack of a GM only added to the limbo nature of the season. The coach didn't know who he was coaching for, the players who they were playing for. They should have named a GM in February at the latest to give the new GM a chance to evaluate who should stay and who should go. It will

Wainwright wasn't consistently sharp. He threw a couple of notably bad pitches and missed on many others. But he made a lot of good pitches, too, and he generally hit spots when he had to. He worked inside quite a bit and to good effect. This was not a bad first start for a pitcher scraping some rust off. He faced a tough lineup in a hitter's park.
The Vikings would keep all revenue from NFL events, including concessions and club seat and suite revenue. It also would get the money from naming rights and advertising on the stadium site. Revenue from events not related to the team would go to the stadium authority.
And so we continued for the next seven months. I didn't keep it entirely to myself. But I was choosey in selecting confidants, not because I thought they'd intentionally sabotage the mission, but because no vault can guard against the powerful forces of pronoun slippage.

Existing scanners could allow passengers to carry on any amount of liquid they want, so long as they put it in the gray bins. The scanners have yet to be used in this way because of concern for the large number of false alarms and delays that they could cause. When I left TSA in 2009, the plan was to designate "liquid lanes" where waits might be longer but passengers could board with snow globes, beauty products or booze. That plan is still sitting on someone's desk.
At the risk of sounding foolish for trying to parse the triumphantly brief statements of the world's great architects: Really? I mean, couldn't you argue that during the recent boom years the easy credit that Ratner and his fellow developers came to rely on was to the skyline what the little blue pill is to, um, blood flow? That pouring 903 Gehry-designed apartments into an already saturated real-estate market is the sort of development folly or feat of architectural daring -- depending on your point of view -- possible only with the financing equivalent of a pharmacological boost?

Two themes have loomed large in obituaries for Charles Colson: his career as a Nixon hatchetman, culminating in his prison term for his involvement in the attempt to smear Pentagon Papers leaker Daniel Ellsberg, and his post-confinement career as a Christian prison reformer. But Colson played another role whose influence was felt in this year's Republican presidential race. The born-again Christian was one of the strange theological bedfellows who produced a 1994 manifesto called "Evangelicals and Catholics Together." His counterpart was a liberal-turned-neocon, Lutheran-turned-Catholic controversialist, the Rev. Richard John Neuhaus.

That could encourage people who already have a smartphone to get a tablet with data service as well. Verizon Wireless has already announced that it is introducing such plans this summer.

Until recently, there had been just one great advance in responding to HIV since it was discovered in 1983: a revolution in treatment. Thanks largely to AIDS activists who demanded expedited research and approvals, today there are more drugs licensed to treat HIV than there are for all other viruses combined. Generous donors and innovative pricing mechanisms have made these antiretroviral drugs available to about 36 percent of those in the developing world who need them to stay alive and healthy.

The first story, "Tower of Babylon," is a boldly conceived Borgesian fantasy about the biblical undertaking to build a tower up to heaven, with an ending at once inevitable and jolting. "Were the tower to be laid down across the plain of Shinar," it begins, "it would be two days' journey to walk from one end to the other." Contemplate that: how far you would walk in two days. Then imagine that distance upended heavenward. Then dilate on the fact that, for the tower builders, it would take even more time to ascend: "Four months pass between the day a brick is loaded onto a cart, and the day it is taken off to form a part of the tower." The strangeness of the account in Genesis is made fresh again via thoughtful expansion, as Chiang's characters contemplate the logistics of construction and marvel at the strange new territory they enter.
Oakland resident Tom Martin might have some tips. The 38-year-old homeowner, who had gotten in and out of $10,000 in credit card debt in the 1990s, was determined not to let that happen again when he went through a recent period without a good job. He took on roommates to cover the mortgage, quit driving his car and used his credit card only for emergencies like furnace repair. Such austere measures helped keep his card debt down to $3,000, which he is paying down now that he is back at work managing a bicycle business in Oakland.

(In other states with COBRA continuation programs, the fee can be as high as 15%.)
The parallels between Wallis and Wally are . . . not so parallel, although the script presents them as soulful Americans hitched to soulless Brit-twits. And as women who long for children. Their kindred-spirithood is established in an opening sequence where Wallis suffers a miscarriage after her first husband physically abuses her and Wally struggles with infertility problems that her emotionally abusive husband does not want to talk about.
Part of what makes the movie so frustrating in its essential flatness is that there is an interesting idea for a film tucked away in all that, something about the intersection of mental illness and possession, the point where faith must pick up what science can no longer explain. But instead of exploring that, there is lots of tedious exposition with an over-reliance on direct-to-camera confessionals as dutiful setup to a handful of dreadfully handled exorcism scenes. One of the key ad images for the film, an elderly nun whose eyes have no pupils, is seen only in passing and there is a lame attempt to milk a big scare out of a dog barking on the street. Directed by William Brent Bell from a script co-written with Matthew Peterman, "The Devil Inside" plays like a horror film conceived on graph paper.

On this side of the Atlantic, it's tempting to view the uproar in purely parochial terms — out of concern that the U.S. economy will continue to be encumbered by the eurozone crisis.

In Silicon Valley-speak, the word "hacker" is more often used to describe someone who comes up with a clever solution to a frustrating problem rather than someone who's committing cybercrimes. Levitas says hackers in the positive sense of the term start from the premise that problems are solvable and then work quickly and cheaply to solve them, learning from their mistakes and trying again — what the startup world refers to as "iterating."
I reached the point when I was 28 or 29 and I was in Washington, D.C., working for this VC firm, that I literally thought my career was washed up. I just thought I had made a series of wrong decisions, and I wasn't on the blueprint I thought I was going to be on. A lot of times, I think, you become an entrepreneur when you feel like you have nothing else to lose. It started to crystallize for me that my passion was creating these break-through consumer services that would change people's lives.

For example, I was in the sweetest, hidden-away taco restaurant in San Antonio on a recent Sunday. Decorative tinsel frills of blue, silver, green, gold and red crisscrossed the ceiling. The walls were lime green, the plastic tablecloths were blue-white, the dark carpet had lavender flowers, the chairs were orange vinyl, and there were probably 75 of them, and you had to wait for a table for lonche. The only thin person there was a woman maybe 90 years old with a walker. How many breakfast tacos can possibly fit between a tight belt and the memory of a small waist? How many flour tortillas? Let's not play around with it—just look at the schoolyards! Of course the explanation is not that there's such an overabundance of wealth, that we feast at a gluttonous Henry VIII banquet table. Some like to defend the bulk, calling it all a genetic propensity. Probably it is, especially when even that thin slice of tomato is avoided. It's lo barato sale caro: Cheap costs the most.

It makes them realize the kids still have respect for the tradition of marriage, still want to get married themselves and still see gay couples as part of that."

California has always been a magnet – a land that has attracted people from across the nation and the world. It's a place that was known for its entrepreneurial spirit and open culture. But it has been turned into a regulatory and tax nightmare, a place where those who already have money can live in their coastal palaces and enjoy the splendor of the landscapes, but where it's unnecessarily difficult to move one's way up the economic ladder. The USC study doesn't reveal anything new as much as it confirms established trends.

• How UW's Justin Wilcox grew from small-town kid to big-time coach -- Bob Condotta, Seattle Times: But the job at Washington and a chance to return to the Pacific Northwest proved enticing. And it didn't hurt that he was able to bring along Sirmon, a Walla Walla native who was named UW's linebackers coach, the same position he held at Tennessee.

"The way he chose to address it is he thought if you just developed responsible and accurate health data, you could counter persistent myths about the uninsured and also connect the fact of being uninsured with harsh health consequences, such as a shorter life span and having more serious illnesses because you didn't test to be diagnosed early," Kuehl said.

At the end of the episode, we see moments from the upcoming season. It seems pretty obvious that some, if not all, of those last-place finishers in each city will, in fact, be coming to the ranch.

It took Ame, the couple's new restaurant in San Francisco's St. Regis Hotel, to give Sone a platform to freely mix cultures, often with glorious results. Some might categorize his handiwork as fusion, which has about as much cachet in the culinary world as a Nehru jacket does in fashion.

Reality is a more complicated thing. The nimble, productive, high-profit dynamo that Daniel Gross describes as America's new economic model is making plenty of people rich. Nevertheless, it is different from the old economy. It requires fewer workers. Those who are lucky enough to have jobs often do not have the benefits, job security and solid middle-class salaries that were more plentiful in the old economy. Older workers may never find a place in this new system. Young people with only a high school education can expect a life of underemployment. Those who have gone deep into debt to pay for a college education may spend years after graduation waiting tables or making lattes before they find a job that matches their skills.

"The suite needed to speak 'sparkling luxury,'" Taylor said. "They both wanted to update the master to be like a high-end hotel suite, but on a sensible budget due to the economy.

One day, on the trail, my mother asked me one too many times to get something out of her pack and then put it back in. Digging into mymother's daypack started to feel queasily cozy, as if the zippered compartments were recesses in our own bodies. And later, when my mother couldn't find her medicine and started to freak out, I called her a catastrophist. For some reason she didn't appreciate this assessment. At dinner, conversation was strained.

• Game 14 Preview: Portland Trail Blazers vs. Atlanta Hawks -- Blazersedge: The best hope for Portland may be an uncanny explosion from one of LaMarcus Aldridge's sidekicks. I'm looking straight at Jamal Crawford here but Gerald Wallace, Wesley Matthews, or even Nicolas Batum would also do. Portland needs a boost somewhere...a wave to knock the Hawks off their feet. It feels like a game where Portland's individual heroics will have to overcome Atlanta's team play. Obviously the Blazers should try to put pressure on the middle of the Hawks defense as well. Aldridge is going to have a hard time getting inside. A few well-placed 15-footers early might clear out the lane enough that Portland's guards could drive and (hopefully) finish over the Horford-less interior.

Torrey Pines' Rachel Nasland, 2013 (Notre Dame).
More important, and particularly pertinent to Romney's choice, was Obama's Tuesday speech comprehensively misrepresenting Rep. Paul Ryan's budget. (For Ryan's refutation of Obama, go to ow.ly/a6hPz.) Remarkably, the 42-year-old congressman is today's agenda-setting Republican. Admirably, Romney has embraced Ryan's approach to altering the ruinous trajectory of the entitlement state and forestalling what that trajectory presages, a "government-centered society" (Romney's phrase in his fine Milwaukee speech Tuesday night).

The tentative debt limit agreement President Barack Obama and leaders in Congress negotiated over the weekend is awful. It involves extensive spending cuts at a time when economic growth and job creation are practically non-existent, all without actually providing enough deficit reduction to secure our long-term prosperity. It offers no assurance (and considerable doubt) that the wealthy and large corporations, who now pay as low a percentage of their incomes in taxes as at any time in decades, will contribute anything whatsoever to the ultimate solution, and it represents less an example of a well-functioning democracy than a case of panicky deal-making. Also, it might not actually pass Congress before the nation starts running out of money to pay its bills tomorrow.
