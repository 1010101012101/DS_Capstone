As word trickled out over recent months that the Fed was planning a new round of bond purchases, the dollar sank. It hit a 15-year low to the Japanese yen Nov. 1. Why? In the simplest terms, a country that cuts interest rates makes its currency less attractive to the worlds' investors. The interest rate is also the investors' yield, the payout they receive. When that yield falls, the world's banks move their money into countries with higher rates. They may exchange U.S. dollars for Australian dollars then invest the money in higher-paying Australian bonds.
A cumbersome policy manual was singled out for the third time in recent weeks as a serious impediment to workers.

Park led Arizona State to a national title in 1998. She won her first and only major, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, in 2004.

All right, I finally took it to the source. These guys make about 15 different sausages, owner Rob Reeves said, and they supply restaurants and grocery stores all over the metro. At lunch time, though, they serve smoked sausage sandwiches over the counter. You can get a knockwurst or an all-beef wiener for $2.50, and there are daily specials, too. The condiments are slim, but if all you want is mustard, you’re in business. For some reason, they’ve also set out a big jar of kraut.

The president keeps promoting an "adult conversation" about the budget, but that can't happen if the First Adult doesn't play his part. Obama is eager to be all things to all people. He's against the debt and its adverse consequences, but he's for preserving Social Security and Medicare without major changes. He's for "tough cuts," but he's against saying what they are and defending them. He pronounces ambitious goals without saying how they'd be reached.

Hey, Jason: I believe Steinbach is under contract for two more years. I think his loss hurt the outside running game in particular because he was so good at pulling and leading sweeps. Of late, the Browns have been working to incorporate Jason Pinkston that way. But he's only a rookie and he played left tackle in college. I believe Steinbach will reclaim his left guard spot next season and Pinkston might be tried at right tackle.

The son of harp master Carey Bell, the Chicago guitarist brings his considerable chops - especially on acoustic here - to a set of gospel and like-minded songs. He's not the first bluestender to mix up a salvation-and-sin cocktail, but "The Devil Ain't Got No Music" is a mighty strong alloy. Opening with an unearthly groove applied to "Swing Low," this Satan-taunting set (titled for one of Mavis Staples' favorite interview quips) tries to reclaim blues from the depths, or bring gospel down to earth, or both.
The professional, casual approach dovetails with the style of restaurant, which has a sense of history preserved in its decor. It was built more than a century ago as the Marine Electric warehouse. The brick walls have been left intact, accented with dark wood floors, slat-wood ceiling and off-white bead board wainscoting, all of which, however, do contribute to the noise level. The focal points are the whimsical George Jetson-like chandeliers, each giving off 74 pinpoints of light.

I sued Baltimore City last summer to stop what I perceived to be an illegal removal of trees. But this was prompted by secrecy and incompetence. We asked for a copy of the city's tree plan, from either the city or BRD, and got nothing. We asked for assurance that no more trees would be cut before the plan was released, and still more trees were cut. As a result of our suit, the city did release its tree plan, and the count of trees actually cut dropped from 139 to about 40. And now, taxpayers will be paying for the replanting — which BRD was supposed to cover.
The CAS ruling cleared the way for American 400-meter runner LaShawn Merritt to defend his Olympic title in London. Merritt completed a 21-month doping ban last year.

Moment you committed to being a musician: I had two "'aha' moments," as Oprah would say. Both happened my junior year of high school. The first happened when I participated in a program for African Americans called the Juilliard Exchange. I got to travel by myself to New York City for a week and participate in activities, sit in on classes and experience the Juilliard School dorms. I had an extreme amount of fun, so I was convinced that I had to go to Juilliard after that. The second moment happened at the end of my junior year, when I had the choice of taking an AP calculus class or choosing a second study hall -- basically choosing to go the way of medicine or music. I took the study hall and chose music. Little did I know that I would later have to fulfill a math and science requirement for my bachelor of music degree, and the AP class I had passed over would have given me the credit.

“The first debate between Romney and President Obama: If I was Romney, I would ask President Obama can you run on your record? More people on unemployment, more people on food stamps, more people on welfare, higher food prices, higher gas prices, $5 trillion more added to the deficit in just three years? I close my case.”
Yes, I'm a sap. I believed Obama when he said he wanted to move beyond the stale ideological debates that have paralyzed this country. I always believe that Obama is on the verge of breaking out of the conventional categories and embracing one of the many bipartisan reform packages that are floating around.
* In a repeat of the main event of last year's WrestleMania, Cena faced The Miz. This time, though, the result was flipped, as Cena wound up on top. The match was pretty good for television, and Miz actually landed some offense, including a good-looking DDT. The downside of this match is that it drove home the point of just how far Miz has fallen in the past year.

Though OWN's ratings are up in both its key demographic (women ages 25-54) and in total viewers, the network in the last few months has experienced personnel shakeups, layoffs and last month's high-profile cancellation of Rosie O'Donnell's talk show after only five months on the air.

Most remarkable of all is “Blame Game,” in which Kanye eavesdrops on a bedroom scene: his automaton ex-girlfriend and her new man (played by Chris Rock), who compliments West on how well he’s fashioned her into a tawdry male fantasy. Like so much on this set, the humor only amplifies the grimness. West knows that he’s dehumanizing the people he encounters, pulling them into his wobbly orbit. He’s aware that he’s doing it, and he knows the consequences. His intelligence only makes his damnation a thorough one, and his distance from other people an unbridgeable obstacle.

The government argued that to broaden damages to include mental distress would open it up to more claims than was intended by Congress when it approved the Privacy Act.

They're also growing quite accustomed to playing tight ones: 10 of their 11 playoff games have been decided by one goal, and only once has Washington scored as many as four.

Hey, Mike: 1. Holmgren has vowed not to make a coaching change, especially after one season. 2. Head coaches make so much money these days, it is rare for them to step into another job soon after being fired. Reid's been burning the oil for 13 years in Philadelphia.

One quarter to one third of borrowers are late or delinquent on the very first payment on their student loans. Most student loans have a six-month grace period before repayment begins. Students often move after graduation, losing track of bills. The loan payment is due even if you do not receive a statement or coupon book. Be sure to notify the lender about any changes in address or contact information. Borrowers who consolidate their federal student loans are more likely to pay on time, with less than one fifth missing the first payment, in part because the first payment is due soon after consolidation.

Scouting report: Great defender and rebounder with a 7-foot wingspan, known for his hard work and character. Lacks shooting range beyond 15 feet. But the kind of kid coaches love. Has maintained he is not leaving school, and Irving only will talk about him if/when he has announced his intention to enter the draft. Said Kentucky coach John Calipari, "Michael is a flat-out winner. He was the leader on one of the best high school teams in the country, not because he's one of the nation's best scorers but because of his intangibles, intensity and passion. With his athleticism and length, he has the ability to be one of our best defenders. I'm looking for Michael to be the fire of this team."
Strength/weakness: Good shooting team with a deep bench, good defensively on the perimeter but at times the Lobos turn the ball over too much and while Gordon is their key player (he can't allow himself to drift outside), they will need step-up performances from guards Kendall Williams and Tony Snell in the tournament.

Q: What will the new schedule look like?
It seemed like an ordinary shopping expedition: two gay men wandering the aisles of a San Francisco Baby Gap in search of a neo-preppy look for their tousle-haired tyke. An adorable attention-grabber, the little fella with the thin neck and long arms didn't prove the easiest of fits, however.

I massaged my shoulders, growing sore from rubbernecking.
The manufacturing sector is also a major adopter of new technologies. New technological innovations have driven down the relative price of capital goods, which has encouraged manufacturers to modernize, investing more in new plants and equipment. This has made the sector not only more capital-intensive, but much more skill-intensive.

MetroHealth enrolled girls between ages 12 and 18 who were in good health. The girls participated in a randomized trial, meaning that some received the HPV vaccine while others received a Hepatitis A vaccine. All of the girls received regular Pap or cervical dysplasia testing and regular blood tests. Not until the trial was over three years later did anyone -- including the trial administrators -- know which vaccine had been given.

So there you have it. Robert Rizzo and Jiminy Glick, Alfred Eisenstaedt and boldly romantic sailors. Will Scott Smeltzer's shot join that long list of photojournalistic icons? Don't know, but if you ever get arrested and dragged off to an arraignment, try to get Scott to shoot it. You'll look really good. I gotta go.
Former department interim director Mark Long and three other employees were placed on paid administrative leave after a Department of Justice investigation into allegations that energy staffers steered a state contract to a company co-owned by Cylvia Hayes, the companion of current Gov.

I wish the same sprucing-up would occur on Falls Road, north of Cold Spring Lane. The bedraggled hodgepodge of stores and beflagged gas stations and car lots look more than ragtag. When I see pictures of this once scenic byway, I ache for landscaping and a more cohesive design.

All of those services target the region’s older population, which is already a big portion of St. John’s patients. About 50 percent of the hospital’s patients are on Medicare.

The Super Bowl XXXIV MVP with the St. Louis Rams, was brought aboard after being cut following the 2003 season. He signed a two-year contract to become the new Giants quarterback — and play mentor to the newly drafted Manning.

Appointing a special prosecutor would be an unusual step but not without precedent. Ten years ago, Bowman and Taylor filed a similar petition that resulted in Biebel naming a special prosecutor to investigate torture allegations leveled against the Chicago Police Department and former police Cmdr. Jon Burge. Though the special prosecutor determined that no charges could be filed because so much time had passed, Burge was convicted in federal court of perjury for lying in sworn testimony about allegations he presided over the torture of criminal suspects from the 1970s to the early 1990s. Burge is serving a four-year prison sentence.
Rogosin and his collaborators arrived with a loose fictional framework, and the film advances its perfunctory plot through a combination of documentary footage (shot at times with hidden cameras) and staged and improvised scenes.

Though he often espouses an unsentimental view of his work — "My job is to work for the owners, who are trying to reach a very expensive piece of real estate" he said — Baffert's health scare and the close association of the horse to his son have given this week a different feeling. The colt got his name more by accident than through an actual tie to Baffert's only son with his wife, Jill. He suggested his son's nickname as a place-holder when owner Ahmed Zayat asked for a suggestion only because someone had just walked by and said it.

Breivik said Wednesday that being declared insane would be the worst thing that could happen to him because it would "delegitimize" his views.
Smith is a reliable and orthodox conservative on taxes and spending, but more liberal on social issues.

While tests such as skin-prick tests and blood tests to detect IgE -- a natural substance that increases when someone is exposed to allergens -- are frequently used to indicate a food allergy, far fewer patients undergo an oral, food-challenge test.
Dunham — the first township, established in 1796 — and Frelighsburg are for the epicure. Knowlton is known for its antiques dealer. Tourists can visit the best wineries — Les Pervenches, Val Caudalies and the second oldest one in the region, l'Orpailleur — and be in Montreal, the largest and closest city, by nightfall. Or they can finish the official wine route of townships within Brome-Missisquoi and venture on through the rest of the Eastern Townships, staying at B&Bs and lakeside inns, and sampling not only wine and ice cider (depending on the season) but artisanal cheese, chocolate, honey, duck and foie gras, and classic French Canadian sugar pie, or tarte au sucre.

The FTA doesn't have a good way to evaluate the cost effectiveness of a multi-modal project, Brouwer said. The $3 billion in highway widening and bridge building might add to the cost, but the project wouldn't get credit for light rail's ability to ease rush-hour congestion on the highway, he said.
"A couple of these boys play together on another team, so it will be a good, friendly matchup," Althoff coach Charlie Kassly said. "We're gonna have to hustle because Edwardsville is gonna bring a whole other intensity than even what O'Fallon brought us tonight."

"I really don't know," he said. "It's still up in the air. To us, it's how many reps can they get, and then let's just see how it is. It's not like every day we're coming in and saying, 'Hey this guy is ahead of that guy.' And, we go so fast, especially in practice, it's tough to know who the center is. It's almost like the only reason you know is if there is a bad snap.
On the set, I also plan to give a shout-out to Wayne Dawson, another class act at that station. I see Wayne at LifeTime Fitness Beachwood almost every time I'm up there.
In this, the measure is really little different from civil laws that permit contraception, consumption of alcohol or eating bacon, all of which are banned by certain faiths. It was not that long ago that people of one race were sometimes prohibited from marrying those of another. Such anti-miscegenation laws remained in force in this country until the mid-1960s.

So I can relax with reckless abandon for a week, and I'd be willing to try two, but I'm pretty sure that into my third week on Fantasy Island I'd start to go a little crazy. Without the hobbies of golfing and boating that so many people enjoy in Florida, I think I'd be rather a lost soul. There are only so many online Scrabble games I can play at one time, and even those look a little fuzzy after a couple of glasses of Riesling.

The installer wouldn’t elaborate on why he didn’t like them, so I didn’t listen to him. I had it installed, and everything was fine. For years we saved $10 per month during cooling season. The unit would sometimes cycle off in the late afternoon on very warm days. We were uncomfortable for a few hours, but that was it. It would go on several times an hour too, so the house never hit sizzling temperatures.

Costa Mesa employs roughly four people for every 1,000 residents. Sure, contract cities like Laguna Niguel (. 87 employees per 1,000) get by fine, but the differences are huge: In Niguel, HOAs assume many duties; the infrastructure is newer and less problematic; the citizenry knew what it kind of city it was getting when it incorporated; employees knew what kind of city they were hiring onto.

The Translational Portfolio is a fascinating look into the future and what a new era in medicine might look like someday. It uses technologies that are just a few years old, like the ability to map a patient's DNA and target specific genes, or to take an adult cell back to its formative state and reprogram it to avoid a previous malfunction.
"President Obama said that the southern border is more secure today than at any time in the past 20 years. I think Arizonans would beg to differ. The President needs to understand that states like Arizona are moving ahead with immigration reform measures of their own because the federal government has failed to act. The best thing he can do to head off state laws he disapproves of is to push Congress to act on comprehensive reform. Yet, the President's speech today seemed more like a nod to his base rather than a genuine effort to move comprehensive immigration reform."

Today's marine layer is thick and extends far inland. So people probably won't be able to see it when station makes two flyovers tonight (Sunday, April 29).

Nearly every mock draft has him going in the late teens to early 20s, which means the Giants will have to move up if they want to land Kirkpatrick.

Indeed, moving Rodriguez wedges his right-handed bat between the lefties Curtis Granderson and Cano. So, there's certainly validity to his thinking.

That's a big, ambitious list of goals on both sides, and coming to any agreement will take time and patience. The two chief negotiators, Saeed Jalili of Iran and Catherine Ashton of the European Union, have been repeating two phrases over and over: Any agreement will be "step by step" and will be achieved on the basis of "reciprocity," meaning each side will have to give a little.

Sara: The new body of work is a series of colored ink paintings on paper. They're really important to me because it's my first body of work since I was hospitalized for over three months in 2010 when I was pregnant with twins. I wasn't able to make work in the hospital, and to top it off, I had to move out of my studio during that time. My family moved it for me. I missed an entire season of the year, came home with two premature babies and didn't even know where my paints were.

14. Courtney Upshaw, OLB/DE, Alabama, 6-1, 272. Opinions vary on him throughout the league, that he isn't as explosive as some others on the board, or as strong. But the bottom line when it's time to play football he gets it done, either rushing the passer or dropping into coverage. He finds the ball and makes things happen.

If my only choices are Ingram or Floyd, I'd go Floyd. Ingram is a natural pass rusher, but has not always been productive. The Bears look for two things in defensive ends: speed and motor. Neither are among Ingram's best traits. There are pass rushers I like more than Ingram who could be available when the Bears pick, but from the available receivers Floyd would be a solid pick. As long as he has learned from his mistakes I think he should be a very good NFL wide receiver.
The debate is an unwelcome one for dozens of vulnerable Democratic incumbents just weeks before Election Day. Already, a handful of Democrats in conservative or swing districts, such as Reps. Gerry Connolly in the northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Bobby Bright in southeastern Alabama, have come out publicly for extending all the cuts -- at least temporarily.

Georgia Tech, Maryland, North Carolina and North Carolina State are all involved with his recruitment.
The cast has flawless timing. Elvey, a newcomer to the Twin Cities, nails Hanan from her shock to her doubts. In the opening audition, she explains how she made her demo tape by talking about a boy who was a boyfriend before he came out. It's a breathless tour-de-force performance. Kapil is excellent as Mary, an academic-cum-record exec with a dominatrix streak.

Secondhand shopping is in the throes of a tech-driven seismic shift, one that is quickly making the gently worn and just-like-new not simply equal in stature to off-the-rack items, but arguably more desirable. How much more would you want that Prada purse or perfect vintage fedora if it were from the closet of your favorite fashion blogger or among favorite items selected by a stylist to A-list stars?

Others think Apple will include the Siri intelligent voice-control feature, and perhaps even a glass screen with a tactile element that can simulate the feel of touch typing.
"Our goaltending in general was not our strength this year. I don’t think it’s fair to lay the blame on one player. You win as a team and you lose as a team. We need to be stronger defensively and that includes our team commitment to defense, not simply the goaltender and not simply the defensemen. It’s really a team concept.

Chandler's life spanned a period of head-spinning change in Southern California, and his death marks the end of an era. He was the last member of his family to run The Times and the last to exert a powerful influence over the life of the region.
National politics around abortion will rage on.

That prompted heavy criticism from Dayton earlier in the day
Otherwise, the East playoffs are going to start with a titanic mismatch between Boston or Chicago (or even Miami) and whichever team gets the No. 8 spot. Right now, the leading contenders are Indiana (27-37) and Charlotte (26-38), and those teams -- both of which had midseason coaching changes -- are doing little that screams "playoffs."

Last year, more than 100,000 tickets were sold to BIFF screenings. But because of censorship issues many of the 200 foreign films at this year's festival, which join 60 Chinese features, may never be seen by the Chinese public. Others may lose certain moments. A nude scene from "Titanic," which held the top box-office record for 11 years after its 1998 Chinese release, was excised from the recent 3-D re-release — its absence noted by film fans who saw uncut versions of the movie on pirated DVD copies. Last year's festival offering "Black Swan" also saw sex scenes snipped.
In San Francisco, the city fathers wanted to relocate Chinatown to Hunters Point, or some other location on the fringe of the city. In an editorial, the San Francisco Call said the old Chinatown, destroyed in the fire, was too valuable "to permit its relapse into the occupation of the swarming, clannish, unclean and troublesome coolie."
"Theater didn't involve the audience enough, and magic wasn't elevated to the art of a theatrical spectacle," he says. "But historically, like in Shakespeare's time, that artificial separation didn't exist. ... I wanted to bring the audience onstage and give them a magical experience while also making magic a theatrical experience.
Smuggling has become so prevalent, the BLM has posted signs on roads leading into the monuments that warn the few remaining visitors to travel with caution.

Yes, R.E.M., the outfit that discovered a way forward for guitar-rock in the synthesized '80s, is hanging up the six-strings.

Ask everyone to bring a few fashion magazines. Supply scissors, glue sticks and plain paper. Guests can tear out pages with modern-day Anne Taintor-type models. Invent an Anne Taintorish catchphrase that relates to the bride-to-be (for example, "Bridezilla -- who me?"), then cut out the letters of that phrase from the other pages of the magazine to glue to the model's image. Present the art as a gift to the bride-to-be.

Both cars topped out at 57 mph in that first race in 1903. But sage observers later pointed out that the real winner wasn't Olds or Winton. It was Daytona Beach.

When one of my friends invited a group of us to a girls-night-out by her pool, that party was a perfect opportunity to work on one of my summer projects. I want to taste all the dry rosés sold at the Wine Merchant, 20 South Hanley Road in Clayton. The Merch, which is conveniently located across the street from my office, has a row of beautiful rosés just calling my name.
Zimmerman remains free because Sanford police said he invoked the "stand your ground" defense and there were no witnesses to disprove it. So does Thomas Baker, who in November 2010 went jogging shortly after midnight with his loaded pistol. He ran into 18-year-old Carlos Mustelier on a jogging trail and ended up pumping several bullets into the man, who he said attacked him. The killing was ruled a justifiable homicide.

Any items in Doll's well-stocked kitchen are considered fair game, and there have also been last-minute runs across the street to Hays' refrigerator (and, on one occasion, a flashlight harvest of her garden).

The writer was William J. Zeile of Arlington, Va., whose great-uncle co-founded a San Francisco furniture shop with Arthur and Lucia Mathews in 1906, in response to the earthquake that devastated the city. The firm mainly produced custom furnishings for offices and residences. But for close friends and family, the Mathewses made extraordinary carved and painted pieces that merge the ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement with the classicism of the American Renaissance, and that's what Kaplan coveted.

One obviously bad option would have been to withdraw from the euro, default on a mountain of debt and slowly climb back from a deep economic depression. Officials in Athens decided to go with a worse option -- stay with the euro, impose draconian austerity, muzzle anyone who utters the word "default" -- that also sent the country into a deep economic depression with no apparent way out.

Yet the U.S. can no more afford to scrap its relationship with Pakistan than Pakistanis can afford to break with Washington. Awkward as the truth may be, Pakistan and the U.S. need each other to prosecute the war on terror. And for that reason, they are going to have to learn to get along despite the hard feelings over bin Laden's killing because the price of failing to continue cooperating with each other could be disastrous for both countries.
At least we know where the unions are coming from. But consider the big picture, as pitched by President Barack Obama: "What we're talking about is a vision for high-speed rail in America. ...
