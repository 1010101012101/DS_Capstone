One of those agencies was Family Resource Center of St. Louis which licensed the Cronins as foster parents. State records show the Cronins failed to inform the agency on their own about the broken arm as required by their foster parent licensing contract. That alone could have been a trigger for a hotline call and possible removal of the baby.

As it turns out, Denver Broncos fans and ESPN columnist Rick ­Reilly aren't the only people willing to be critical of Cutler. Many ­current and former players don't care for him, either, or they wouldn't have been questioning his toughness, heart and character on television and in other public forums during his darkest hour.

Wiper blades. Just as the rubber in tires and hoses can break down in summer's heat, so too can the rubber in your wiper blades. Wiper blades that may have already been compromised by inclement conditions during the cold weather months will degrade even more during a summer heat wave.

The annual report analyzed more than 1.6 million stops by 630 police agencies statewide.

I'm really looking forward to the Olympics and, hopefully, I'll be able to come and represent my country."
No, not at all. Sometimes they tried to play that out a little bit to make the show more interesting, but I didn't have any issues with anyone at all. I think a lay person's understanding of the way a kitchen works is really different than when you're actually a chef in the kitchen. Things get said in haste in the middle of service. If someone smashes into someone else with a hot sheet tray, they might barely get a sorry. There's no time for formalities when you're under the gun like that. Nobody takes it personally. In the kitchen it's never personal -- at least rarely.
We don't know if Fisher plans to modify his approach in St. Louis; it may depend on his choice of an offensive coordinator. I doubt we'll see a radical deviation from his philosophy in Tennessee. We can expect a power running game and play-action passes.

Don't get me wrong - the food on its own is excellent. The autumn salad ($15) looks like a fantastical forest, anchored by "logs" of chestnut puree. Scattered over and around them were florets of green cauliflower, paper-thin slices of radishes, dices of apples, chunks of beets, ribbons of daikon and delicate leaves of frisee and other greens. Barrel-aged Banuyuls vinegar tied it all together, but each ingredient seemed to be dressed separately, which made the array come together flawlessly.
Right up front, you'd have to suspect that the Mancrunch.com bid is a hoax, designed to generate free publicity. For a company to come out of nowhere -- Buchter says the site has been in operation only since January -- and to expect to waltz into the Super Bowl lineup with its cheeky ad for a gay dating service seems pretty naive. I mean, how mangled does your cultural antenna have to be to think such an ad will fly?

Second, wasn't the council member told that further involvement with the project would be a violation of state conflict-of-interest laws? Her employer, the San Mateo County Economic Development Association (SAMCEDA), is a central booster of the project, regardless of its environmental impacts. Third, is it legal to vote on just vague project "benefits" (in Foust's words), with all the many serious impacts yet to be detailed?

The method became indispensable to modern chemistry and the pharmaceutical industry because it allowed scientists to "make three-dimensional representations of drugs so that we understand what they look like in space and can understand how they work," said Eaton Lattman, chief executive of Hauptman-Woodward. "I don't think there's a single pharmaceutical that's been developed in the last 30 years that hasn't been studied using derivations of what Dr. Hauptman and his colleagues won the Nobel Prize for."
Mr. Obama's jobs strategy is more of the same. Even if this new piecemeal strategy works, the results will be just as underwhelming as the White House's previous efforts to stoke employment. A truly effective jobs initiative would permanently cut taxes and reduce spending, while curtailing unnecessary regulations, and empowering industries that are proven to create jobs.

“I read about the marathon and sent the information to my friends,” he said. While none of them will be joining him, they gave him a good--natured needling, “because I’m always the one who hosts a marathon of, like, every-thing.

The Americans finally broke through in the second half, with Morgan scoring her second goal of the tournament in the 69th. Rapinoe booted a pass that traveled almost half the length of the field and Morgan, who replaced the injured Cheney at halftime, beat three defenders to catch up to it. She shook Kumagai, touched the ball once with her right foot, stutter-stepped and then delivered a left-footed blast from 17 yards that Kaihori had no chance at stopping.
Sullinger was solid in two games, scoring 30 points and grabbing 15 rebounds. But Thomas a 6-7, 225-pound shooting guard/small forward, went for 49 points and 19 boards. And he is a threat from behind the arc.

Rafaela Carrasco, the choreographer and star, dares to challenge gender stereotypes—she often wears pants, and when the lights come up on four dancers silhouetted in ruffled gowns, the performers turn out to be men.

Long an admirer of Demme's work, particularly with such actresses as Jodie Foster, Melanie Griffith and Mary Steenburgen, DeWitt was excited to join the ranks of Demme goddesses. Despite runs on the Fox series "Standoff" and the AMC hit " Mad Men," however, the theater veteran feels she's still learning her on-screen craft. The director's choice of shooting as intimately as a home movie -- often with practical video cameras in the hands of cast members -- first confused her, then deepened her performance.

In the mid-1990s, in the space of about three years, he had crisscrossed the Atlantic 34 times plus trips to Asia and other international destinations for racing.

The film, directed by Ami Canaan Mann (daughter of Michael, who is a producer) is beautifully, creepily atmospheric, with a good cast and a story inspired by actual crimes.

I agree that our schools are in a great deal of hurt. But I don't think we can fix the problems by raising property taxes on the backs of the large portion of "not so wealthy" people in Oregon. You (Mr. Hellman) have a great retirement through PERS which is paid for by us not so fortunate. The majority of those of us that are retired are trying to get by on Social Security. If the politicians and the public employees had to do as we do, they would not be so willing to raise taxes.

A: Hey, Don: Players receive their base salary in 17 weekly installments during the season. They don't get a separate check for practice. Because of the potential for suspensions based on game checks, agents frequently seek to keep base salaries as low as possible and have the bulk of their player's compensation come from guaranteed bonuses.

But determining Inge's remaining value can occur only when he's healthy enough for an honest evaluation. Don't waste your breath arguing about Inge's sub-.200 spring-training batting practice as the last convincing argument against him staying on the roster.

As students at the California Culinary Academy and interns in The Chronicle's Food section, we're constantly pelted with that question from friends and family members.

Ray Harper was named the Hilltoppers' interim coach. The Toppers closed the regular season with three wins in four games before their Sun Belt tourney run.
Another anti-Canadian oil decision came late last month from the European Union. Canada has been trying to work out a free-trade deal with Europe, but the bloc ruled last month that Canadian crude oil extracted from oil sands is more of a pollutant than other sources of oil, assigning it a bureaucratic rating to reflect this assessment.

Europeans, meanwhile, are selling their first-to-sixth-born children to put gas in their Renaults.

Through the years of the Handbook one of the easiest players to predict each season has to be Albert Pujols. There's a reason why ESPN had him standing at a Xerox machine for his commercial.

1973 -- $800,000 barrier: Anshen & Allen presents 18 designs. The winner is a lightweight 8-foot-high rail, with rods about the size of a thick pencil, that will not impede the view. It is estimated to cost $800,000.

Every year I imagine Maybin being at least four years older than he actually is. He may have been around forever, but did you know he just turned 25 earlier this month? Last year, in his breakout campaign with the Padres, he proved he could run, swiping 40 bags. He's got 4 so far this year, but his low batting average has kept him from exploiting his speed further. A low BABIP and a higher-than-ever walk rate suggests he'll be completely fine. Maybin was a 13th-round pick this preseason, but I believe he could be had for 18th- or 19th-round type players in a trade such as Colby Rasmus or Matt Joyce. Find the fed-up owner then pounce.

This was the central question raised and left unanswered by the riots — and it remains essential to Los Angeles. But 20 years later, the shelf of books addressing the disaster is threadbare, conditional even, as if we've never figured out how to write about these events. Sampogna's poem appears in a small anthology called "The Verdict Is In," edited by Kathi Georges and Jennifer Joseph and issued by the San Francisco independent publisher Manic D Press. It's long out of print, as is Jervey Tervalon's 2002 collection "Geography of Rage: Remembering the Los Angeles Riots of 1992," which gathered recollections by 39 writers (disclosure: I am one of them) on the 10th anniversary of the tumult. On my desk are a handful of other titles that deal, in one way or another, with the upheaval: Wanda Coleman's "The Riot Inside Me," with its heartbreaking title essay, Lynell George's "No Crystal Stair: African-Americans in the City of Angels," which opens with the astonishing "Waiting for the Rainbow Sign."
"I left Washington, but I don't plan to stop fighting for middle class families," Warren wrote in a posting Thursday on Blue Mass Group, a popular blog among Massachusetts Democrats.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) — Jae Crowder had 25 points and 16 rebounds, Darius Johnson-Odom scored 12 of his 20 points in the second half and Marquette withstood another furious rally by BYU.
Why does the U.S. need Pakistan? For one, most of the supplies for the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan have to pass through Pakistani territory. If the U.S. lost access to those routes it could jeopardize the fight against the Afghan Taliban at a time when American officials are trying to stabilize the country enough to turn over its security responsibilities to Afghan government forces in 2014. Preventing a resurgence of the Taliban along Afghanistan's porous border with Pakistan is a key to that strategy, and the U.S. needs to continue pressing the Pakistani military to take stronger action against the insurgent bases on their side of the border.
AMC certainly can be forgiven a misfire, even one on as epic a scale as "Hell on Wheels." This is, after all, the cable home of "Mad Men," "Breaking Bad" and "The Walking Dead." Even its failures (think about last year's one-season "Rubicon") have been intriguing.
"We must make the most of this moment," Ban told reporters. "We need to see more such progress, more international support for Myanmar's efforts to bring about democratic change."

"When you look at the cars parked at Coachella, you see license plates from all around the country," said Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert industry trade Pollstar.

“What’s impressed you about this run for Kansas?” a reporter asks about Wildcats’ opponent in the championship game. As questions go, it’s as easy as an uncontested layup.
The loss was charged to reliever Manny Acosta, who gave up the go-ahead single to Lowrie in the eighth. It was Acosta’s second inning of work. Manager Terry Collins stuck with him for a second frame because the bullpen is taxed, and because he was saving other pitchers like Jon Rauch and Bobby Parnell for when the Mets might have a lead.

48 Oliver, Aaron LB 6-0 219 Arizona State
It's been suggested that this year's glut of 9/11 specials (thickened with repeats from earlier years and anniversaries) risks trivializing a time of unspeakable tragedy, of exploiting the moment as much as honoring it (a fine line the media walk most days). Of course, the trivialization of 9/11 can be said to have begun on the very morning of Sept. 11, as reality was quickly framed with special graphics and music and the conjectural chatter of time-filling talking heads; television brings everything down to its level. Yet to the extent that the nation and the world became one, for those few days, it was through the window of a TV screen.
With Luebke making the calls, it's easy to see why.
School officials say part of the reason the state may want the closure is that DOE wants access to its facilities — several former parochial schools — for another charter school. G.

Finally, the quality is outstanding for everyone, at one-half to one-third the cost per person that we have here (including the 45 million uninsured). That means that taxes and the costs of doing business would go down. If GMC figures a cost of $1,800 per car for health care expenses, and we had had a full public health system, GMC could have charged $1,800 less per car, and just maybe would not have gone under.
"Nine days of early voting is certainly an improvement on the status quo," he said.

Drama: "Water by the Spoonful" by Quiara Alegría Hudes, an imaginative play about the search for meaning by a returning Iraq war veteran working in a sandwich shop in his hometown of Philadelphia. Finalists: "Other Desert Cities," by Jon Robin Baitz, a drama about an affluent California couple whose daughter has written a memoir that threatens to reveal family secrets about her dead brother, and "Sons of the Prophet," by Stephen Karam, about a Lebanese-American family that blends comedy and tragedy in its examination of how suffering capriciously rains down on some and not others.

The one person who somewhat dents Wraysford's emotional armor is a common ditch digger named Jack Firebrace (Joseph Mawle). Uncharacteristically, Wraysford lets him off the hook for a serious infraction, earning loyalty from the man in return and, in the end, a reminder of the true purpose of life.
The White House has said it wants the legislation wrapped up by March 18, but that seems unlikely.

THE menu instructs "save some room for DESSERT." That's a tough order here, yet somehow you've got to do it. Pastry chef Dahlia Narvaez worked with Silverton at Campanile, and together they've devised the perfect desserts for this kind of food. Get something, if only the textbook-crunchy almond biscotti to accompany your espresso. Just introduced on the menu is a Meyer lemon gelato pie that's absolutely irresistible. It has a buttery dark graham cracker crust topped with a fragrant, but not too sweet Meyer lemon gelato and a drift of softly whipped cream.
Still, it's a change that many on the School Board believe district parents have been prepared for. The decision was the product of eight months of debate, dozens of meetings, focus groups and polling.

Big dippers: You'll have to dip deep into your pockets to pay for a stay at Four Seasons Hualalai, just north of the Kona airport, but at least its seven pools with many comforts can ease the pain. My favorite is the King's Pond, an ocean-fed snorkeling lagoon lined with lava rocks and strategically placed enclaves of pairs of lounge chairs. Its hours are limited to protect the marine life — including friendly rays — but there's always another pool available while you wait.
Smash Mouth has a long way to go before it reaches the 150 million mark, but it has sold 10 million albums worldwide.

Spaniards arriving in Mexico found Indians cooking with corn, beans, chilies, tomatoes and squash, often combined with wild game. The Europeans brought beef, pork and lamb, nuts, fruits, cheese, spices and sugar cane (by way of the Caribbean), and local women promptly incorporated these ingredients into their cooking. To the Spaniards' dismay, the result was not Spanish dishes but new versions of native food: simple but nutritious dishes in the north, seafood specialties in the coastal regions, complex sauces in Mexico City and the central states and spicy, Maya-influenced creations in the south. Here are a dozen favorites to seek out:

"I told (Chrismer) that I was not ready to because Henry Adkins is still the only game in town," Schnur said in an interview. "There's no point in putting a bid (request) out when you know the result before you put it out there. My hope is we wind up with a couple more manufacturers out there that can satisfy the requirement for the 2005 certification. Then we enhance the competitive nature of the bid."

Those taken away described being tortured and assaulted by Zimbabwean police as part of a widespread campaign of violence against the MDC. The rights activists have said high level officials and ministers are implicated, but not Mugabe himself. They have refused to name the officials, saying that might make further investigation and possible arrests more difficult.

It is a rare move for a starting pitcher to make that jump as the Cardinals usually like their highest-ceiling starters to at least make a turn through the pitcher-friendly Florida State League. (Shelby Miller, for example, spent half a season there; Carlos Martinez, who will follow Rosenthal into tonight's game as a reliever for the big-league club, is set to start the season with a return to High-A Palm Beach.)

Arthur is tearful, and thanks Jesse for "never giving up on me," and promises his father, "I will get rid of all of this weight."
A: Yes, there are a couple of gifts that didn't go as well as they could or should have. I have learned from those. And, no, I'm not talking about the "misses", just add it to the learning curve.
Not all prospects receive complete MLB clearance. That usually involves questions about the player's identity. A common practice among buscones is to move a player from one town to another and have him assume the identity of another family. When a player's family history comes into question, he can take a voluntary DNA test -- DNA tests for employment are prohibited in the Dominican Republic -- to prove who he is.

The FDA says that Amyvid "is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia" in those who have no problematic symptoms. It's an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer's disease may be the cause.

Susan Norton is a personal chef by trade, running Epicurean Delights out of Palm Harbor for years. In November, she took over a charming space on Main Street in Dunedin formerly occupied by a massage therapist and opened Hot Dogs on Main. Why hot dogs? "Hot dogs are fun, and the demographic really needed it." It also gives her an opportunity to experiment with sauces and to exercise a little dog humor: The Greek Hound Dog reads like a Greek salad crafted atop a tube steak; the "poodle dog" is a reduced-fat spin; a special Italian Greyhound featured pesto and shaved Pecorino Romano.

Red Onion is Dang Boonyakamol's third explosion in the Portland area -- first at Cha Ba Thai on Sandy Boulevard several years ago, and until recently, at the impressive Dang's Thai Kitchen in Lake Oswego. Dang's greatest strength is working with textures, making them turn out the way they should and setting different ones against each other in the same dish. His crispy dishes are seriously crispy -- a specialty dating back to Cha Ba -- and in the most crowded, chili-laced stir-fries, his meats never turn into casserole casualties, keeping their tenderness and their identity. Sure, he can do a chicken with green curry, but the dishes you haven't seen in lots of other places are more interesting.

Ed Royce in 2006, he said, when he chose to "not sit back" but get actively involved.

Even six months ago, that kind of talk might have sounded as outmoded as John Molloy, who penned "Dress For Success," the 1980s bible of corporate style. Casual clothing has long been seen as a sign of a modern attitude and has become an important job perk.

The jars are great for party dips, too. A classic Tex-Mex seven-layer may look fantastic when it first appears at the potluck buffet, but a few chips in and the thing looks downright debauched. So Martha Stewart suggests layering the ingredients in tiny grab-and-go Mason jars - and sautéing pinto beans with onion and garlic and mashing them with a fork, instead of resorting to a mushy canned mix. The colorful results retain their pretty layers. Everyone gets his own. And they can double-dip to their heart's content.

What we don't often see are the long-term results of such contortionism, including joint surface damage, muscles too loose to support a knee or hip, and sheer physical weakness.
