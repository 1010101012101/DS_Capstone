The reforms also mean some current Chicago-area union leaders will be unable to base their public pensions on hefty union paychecks. Instead, their pensions would be calculated on the city salary they had when they left to work for the union, factored for inflation. Those officials already on the books would be allowed to keep counting their years as union employees to rack up public pension credit. Going forward, however, both current and future city employees who leave city jobs to work full time for unions no longer will be able to count union experience toward their pensions.
The team — Cayla Phillips, Haley Chynoweth, Tessa Warner, Hannah DeAngelis and alternate Meagan Gaedtke — also had to execute chicken butchery and knife skill presentation. They also had to create a packet of standardized recipes and a calculated cost analysis report of their menu — “And with nine components minimum per course, that works out to about a 90-page document,” Woodward said — that is scored and scrutinized to the last detail.

But when it comes to power, nothing reveals the childhood fascination with smallness so much as the appeal of the microcosm. The dollhouse, the toy theater, the action figures on the rug — there is an impulse at work in the early years to replicate the world in miniature and then tower over it. This may explain, incidentally, the appeal of Legoland, where, with its 20-to-1 scale, even a tot can feel like King Kong looming over a replica Empire State Building.
"At least when it comes to mortgages, the banks have the right address, everyone agrees about the interest rate.

2010 Roark Wine Co. Santa Ynez Valley Chenin Blanc ($15, 12.3% alcohol): A small side project label from Ryan Roark, who works for Central Coast winemaker Andrew Murray. Roark tapped 30-year-old Chenin vines behind the Curtis winery for one of the state's most masterful examples of the grape. Distinct spruce aromas are matched by a creamed honey accent, plus ryegrass and quince.

Bipartisan embarrassments. Boy, did I hear from a lot of people who disgusted by the behavior of both state Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, and state Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary. During a public hearing, both men ignored residents who simply wanted to be heard; the lawmakers did things like chit-chat and play on Facebook. Both men are a mess. But here's the difference: Most Democrats are embarrassed by Siplin. Republicans elected Dorworth as a future House speaker.

Like "Beloved," "Song of Solomon" and other Morrison novels, the book is a journey and a reckoning. Using bus money given to him by a pastor, Money travels from the Pacific Northwest to Chicago to his dreaded hometown, Lotus, Ga., "the worst place in the world," where nobody "knew anything or wanted to learn anything." Warned from the start that the North is no less racist than the South, he encounters violence and segregation and the lawlessness of police. Once in Georgia, he is almost relieved. At least the pace is "human," Money observes, there was "time to instruct one another, pray for one another, and chastise children in the pews of a hundred churches."

But the city releases pit bulls only to rescues that are screened and have pit bull experience. Eight groups qualify, but they can't keep up with the flood of dogs.

Deadpan comedy in rural Norway that grows on you slowly, slyly, surreptitiously. It's a riff on sociological research that starts in Sweden after World War II, where scientists in a fictional Home Research Institute have been doing time-and-motion studies of housewives in their kitchens. Now it's time for them to study the kitchen routines of single men, so they dispatch a team of observers to the Norwegian countryside.

In fact, voluminous research suggests such laws are actually likely to make the problem worse.

* The follow-up with Punk's field sobriety tests fell flat with me. While it got a little funny by the end, it took a long time to get there and was completely predictable.

"Why bother establishing a new form of county government? The voters in Cuyahoga County have caused these problems.

Face it, people, on Election Day most of you are nothing but political zombies. "
4. Metta World Peace got into foul trouble. The Lakers used to find ways to limit World Peace's playing time. But with his production consistently improving, his picking up his third foul with 8:10 left in the second quarter severely hurt the Lakers. His 11 points on four-of-11 shooting may not look that great, but the points came off hustle plays. He also posted three rebounds and three assists. So it shouldn't be surprising the Spurs outscored the Lakers 26-16 after he got into foul trouble.

He wants what is best for his teenage son Dylan (Colin Ford) and 7-year-old daughter Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones), but particularly in the case of Dylan, he doesn't know how to provide it. Dylan is remote, spending his time drawing horrific pictures, and Benjamin struggles to reach him. He fares better with Rosie, but the family has been rocked by tragedy -- how could it not be?

Paul, if you come aboard we can become fully baked and make a difference.
Bell also objects to other new rules. One is a rule that requires all theaters to present at least 8 performances of each show, which bothers him because there's a built-in exemption for the Muny.

Allman's been carrying all that weight for decades. Duane Allman, a pioneering slide guitar player whose legacy still vibrates in rock 'n' roll and the blues, was the force who kept driving the Allman brothers toward worldwide fame as The Allman Brothers Band.

As for the question of whether CASA is crossing the line in trying to persuade people not to sign the petition, the group's members are exercising their political rights, just as the petition gatherers are. Delegate Smigiel has done important work in making sure that local authorities recognize petition organizers' right to gather signatures in public places, and he should recognize that the opposing side has the same right to express its point of view about a matter of public policy. If the backers of the petition drive have actual evidence that representatives of CASA or any other groups that support the law have engaged in harassment, they should call the police. All those involved on both sides of the issue need to be respectful.

Spags will find ways to get them on the field at the same time; Hall has done a good job as an inside rusher on passing downs. And with veterans such as Hall and DT Fred Robbins, Quinn has some quality mentors to help him reach his potential. A good situation.
