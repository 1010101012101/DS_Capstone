Obama is correct that certain cultures believe a man takes on the powers of whatever he eats. In Liberia, where presidential contests are somewhat more primal than in this effete republic, Samuel Doe was captured by some of his eventual successor's, ah, campaign staff, who cut off President Doe's ears and then fed them to him. They then removed His Excellency's genitals and wound up in a fight over who should get them, believing that the still-not-quite-yet-late president's powers would be transferred to whoever got to chow down on the crown jewels. I'm not suggesting that President Obama has eaten a human penis, because, if he had, he'd almost certainly have boasted about it to the impressionable NPR ninnies who gobbled up his memoirs. But I am suggesting that Mitt Romney might like to consider it for next year's Inauguration Day.

A large swag from Hobby Lobby provided most of the other elements. It had silver poinsettias, silver stems, and dark evergreen needles. The total was truly heinous but when deconstructed, the pieces were separated into piles of like colors. The red potpourri was singled out and all the silver bits went into the pile for New Year's. Some of the ivory chunks of potpourri were put with the red, and the rest with the silver. The remainder, the indiscriminate colors - too orange, a dreary beige or dark green - were taken outside, piled onto a dropcloth and spray-painted either red or silver.

But rebranding requires more than building and bragging. In 2011, four major health care systems allied with city and county officials to start Healthy Cleveland, a campaign to make this region as noteworthy for the health of its citizens as it is for the quality of its hospitals.

These healthier approaches need to become part of the story we tell about ourselves.

Personal story: "I would have to say my biggest obstacle so far would be getting a stress fracture. Last year I had intense pain in my leg throughout all of the track season and ran through it. I'm glad I did, because that year I got all-state in 300m and the 4x400. I trained throughout summer and ran cross country this year to keep in shape while simultaneously playing tennis. I went to state in both. After both of these seasons were over, I continued training throughout the winter. This constant running and never taking a break is what gave me the stress fracture, forcing me to completley stop running for the 10 weeks before track. It almost completely healed and when track started, I trained on a bike for the last couple of weeks needed to heal. I have been running for about two weeks now and there is still no pain. I will be running in my first competitive meet this Saturday and cannot wait!"

Of course Issa opposes the mandate; he's a Republican, and he's entitled to his position. As committee chairman, he has some leeway about what issues he wants to pursue and whom he wants to hear from. But the House oversight committee is not his personal plaything, and its hearings are funded by taxpayer dollars. Shouldn't he make at least a token effort to show that he's not using the committee for purely partisan purposes? Shouldn't he at least pretend that he's trying to grapple with a public policy conundrum — a conflict between religious liberty and healthcare policy — rather than merely taking pot shots at Democrats? Shouldn't any member of Congress be interested in hearing all sides of an issue?

He greeted a few passersby with "Good morning" and shook hands with Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones, who was implicated in Dimora's indictment last week.

For now, JetBlue bundles Even More Speed with its older but somewhat improved "Even More Space" option for extra-legroom seats in the front of the cabins. The space option also now includes early boarding and therefore priority access to cherished space in the overhead bins. Together, JetBlue re-brands both options under the "Even More" umbrella, which will undoubtedly see future additions. Prices for the bundle start at $10 for a short flight and run up to around $100 for longer flights. JetBlue says it will sell Even More Speed separately "later this year."

If the Rams were going to fire Devaney, they also were probably best off replacing Spagnuolo, in my view. Changing both positions allows the next leadership regime to start fresh together and on the same page.

Prior to this past weekend, Pittsburgh hadn’t surrendered more than seven third-down conversions this season, and the Houston Texans’ 50 percent on Oct. 2 had been the defense’s worst showing. The Steelers forced just two three-and-outs against the Ravens Sunday night.

"They were the idea of the studio who wanted to capitalize on the Beatles' `Hard Day's Night' with a weekly TV show built around the same kind of high-spirited hi-jinks," said legendary producer Don Kirshner in an interview with The Star-Ledger in 1997. (Kirshner died last year.) "What they did was hold a cattle call and selected the four guys out of a thousand or so, based on their appearance, rather than any musical ability," he continued.

Basketball is still the easy part. That could be printed on his business card. Sometimes life is a make-or-miss proposition, and the fact that he’s shooting 38 percent this season as a starting two-guard is irrelevant to him as long as he can consult the standings without cringing and suit up again tomorrow.
In 2010, somebody at Nike produced a tongue-in-cheek video in which the camera cut back and forth between Flanagan and Goucher, who skewered each other like Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney.

The thoroughly bought-in Bruins will visit Scottrade Center tonight, seemingly a little worse for wear.

Research also tells us the community wants to learn a little something when they come to the Garden. Again, we are at the forefront. We were pleased to announce just last week that the Garden was selected as a pilot site in the nation's first initiative to create a set of benchmarks for sustainable site management and landscaping. Over the next two years, the Garden will build on and demonstrate best conservation practices on both institutional and residential scales for its guests and neighbors in University Circle.

Hough: I think initially I might have been, when it was going to be a musical. I was hired for the dancing and singing aspect. But this version of the movie is like the original.

I'm more interested in traveling and going to these other countries and helping these people out. I thought this was a good way to put my feet in the water. It's kind of an experiment."

While owner Laura Williams feels her regular price for fresh, from-scratch products is fair, she says it's still steep for customers who stop by after visiting social services agencies in the neighborhood.

When unfair judicial systems exist, it mainly is the result of political abuse, as in Illinois' expensive partisan elections of judges. Justice is much better served by the merit selection of judges, which is how the Missouri Non-Partisan Courts Plan selects judges for courts in Kansas City, St. Louis and St. Louis County. The term "Missouri Plan" doesn't have the pizzazz of Judicial Hellhole®, but at least it serves the genuine cause of justice.
Asked in an interview if he supported a year-round school year, Obama said: "The idea of a longer school year, I think, makes sense."

The Ohio Democratic Party, however, says there's more to the Mandel matter. Mandel, who won his statewide office in November, apparently is using his old state campaign infrastructure -- his state campaign website and e-mail list -- for a federal (U.S. Senate) campaign. While this can appear to be a minor matter, politicians in fact spend a lot of money to develop good campaign websites, and a strong, established e-mail list can be worth a lot of money for a politician.
"Job No. 1 for whoever comes into this new government is to reestablish confidence among voters that their government is being run in a transparent manner," Williams said. "I'll bring a balanced perspective. I've met a payroll. I understand the complexities of how government works."

While educators must decide if punishment can stop short of expulsion under the circumstances, there can be no excusing the use or even possession of an unlawful weapon by a student. Nor, however, should there be any tolerance for the cruelty that drove a young person to such an act.
"Regardless of how other people want to do it — there's a million ways to do it — but this is a way to do it that I particularly like the style. I like being part of it and I like the locker room and I like the meeting room when we are like we are, and our guys do, too," Carroll said. "We like to play to it. We're not trying to win any popularity contests. We're just trying to win games and play well, so this is the way we're doing it."
The SafeGround movement began several years ago in response to police rousting homeless people from a large encampment along the American River Parkway.

These players want to believe in the coaches who recruit them. They want to believe they will be the No. 1 tight end if they go to that school. That's what they are told.

Miller defended himself in a later interview.

"So I brought that up and asked whether they had made any decisions, and he said that they were still looking at candidates and that they would be meeting soon. I interpreted that as Tuesday. But he couldn't tell me exactly when because it was a secret process. He didn't give any specifics."

"I knew Scott was tense, but (the custody battle) was going on for a year and a half. It was postponement after postponement after postponement," she said.
The best chance for Fesenko, who signed with the Pacers in late March, to play this series was if Howard was playing. They could use his height, strength and six fouls against the league's best center.
The closely geared manual transmission really, really needs an additional gear; this transmission's five gears aren't enough for daily driving. That's mainly because, at 70 mph, the engine buzzes loudly running at more than 3,000 rpm. I tried to shift into a nonexistent 6th gear more times than I'd like to admit.
In the film, she plays Nathalie, who works for a Swedish company in Paris, although we never figure out what their business is. There are files and dossiers, but no hint of whether they make furniture or sell financial derivatives.

Under the proposal, each teacher, including related arts, would have two 50-minute periods a day, one for personal planning time and one for program implementation.

This means lots of jumping out of planes and cool shots of submarines, swift boats, helicopters, aircraft carriers and some weird little mini-sub thing straight out of a Bond movie that I didn't even know we had. Hollywood is good at portraying military might, but not as good as the Pentagon.

Kasich has until Monday to sign or veto the bill. If he does nothing, it automatically becomes law. That must not happen. Lake Erie is an asset that requires stewardship. It is not a resource to be plundered.

More unusual are the lettuce packets stuffed with minced, sautéed chicken gizzards. They have an earthy funk that's delicious. Go chu are slender peppers stuffed with whitefish and cut open on the diagonal showing off the stuffing (which can be beef as well). I liked the thinly sliced conch tossed with slivered Asian vegetables, but a raw fish dish something like sashimi doesn't have much flavor. And mandu, the Korean equivalent of pot stickers, are just OK, nothing special.
“A lot of times you have to take crazy risks in Hollywood,” says Medved. “Look at ‘The Hunger Games,’ an $80 million movie with a director who hadn’t made a film in nearly 10 years. And sure, before you came out, you heard, ‘Who the hell picked this director?’ ‘Who picked this cast?’... But when it came out, consumers on Fandango weren’t talking about that. They were talking about the movie.”

But Putin won the election easily, returning to the Kremlin seat he held in 2000-2008. That raised questions about whether the opposition could maintain its momentum against a leader who dismisses them as naive youths, Western stooges and who won't have to run for re-election for six years.

He pleaded guilty to second-degree official misconduct and unauthorized use of a computer. A plea agreement called for Lawrence to receive three years of bench probation and to perform 24 hours of community service.
Granted, there's nothing wrong with requiring photo ID of voters in the states that require them. But much like the 2006 ordinance to bar landlords from renting to illegal residents, a legally dubious measure Waldron spearheaded, Waldron is pandering to the culture warriors who make up her base, not the pragmatic interests of the city. (Thankfully, the rest of the council appears to have no appetite for a voter ID clause in the proposed charter.)
They aren't.

"Yup, that's what I'm doing. Can I help you?"
He said the Big East remains an attractive home for UCF because of the vast national media exposure, strong football programs, elite basketball programs and a television contract that will likely generate seven to 10 times as much revenue as the Knights currently make with Conference USA.
Fortunately, this story is uncomplicated. A man named Ivan must enter a darkly magical world controlled by the evil sorcerer Kaschei to find his lost love. Along the way, he stumbles across a flock of brilliant red firebirds and becomes fascinated, snaring one. She escapes, but leaves him with a magic feather that allows him to summon her when the going gets tough.
The Desperate Paws of Orange County Dog Club posted the petition online Friday. It takes issue with council members' statements that the city shouldn't restrict where people can buy dogs and that local animal-control officials could verify that pet stores aren't getting puppies from high-volume breeding operations, or "puppy mills," that activists say are inhumane.
"The owner's intention is to look for a suitable purchaser," said his attorney, Scott Greenberg. A hearing on the bankruptcy is set for Monday.

Not that guards aren't important. But the Chargers already have two starting guards in Louis Vasquez and Tyronne Green and if they want a backup they don't have to rip out their throats to get one in the first round. DeCastro is a nice player. He could be in the NFL for 15 years. The Chargers don't need him.
Tuck’s revival was complimented by Jason Pierre-Paul’s two sacks, which have become routine of late. In all, the Giants sacked Sanchez five times, along with issuing a number of other hits the third-year quarterback took.

"Even if we didn't go downstate we definitely changed the way people look at women's basketball (at Niles West)," Loyd said.

We gave Niles West a little excitement."

Overall, the Tiger boys finished third with 62 team points as Dover won the meet with 136 and Crestwood was second with 69.
Seize the day, as they say. Another time, I fell in love (which I always seem to be doing with trees) with a little redbud with the musical name Cercis canadenis 'Forest Pansy.' It has charming heart-shaped red leaves. Sadly, it died one summer, felled by the heat and in a dry spot that sprinklers just missed. I was broken-hearted but decided not to replace it since, having cancer, I wasn't likely to be around when it matured enough to enjoy. Then one day I ran into a good-looking specimen of reasonable size, which the nursery promised to deliver. That was five years ago, and my 'Forest Pansy' and I are still going strong.
FYI...The last of several attempts in Oregon to open primary elections was in 2008, ballot measure 65. The top two primary vote getters to the general election.
Nevertheless, I cannot help it. A warning must be sounded. A fist of protest must be raised. For lo the headline did scream, "Taco Bell jumps into breakfast market," and then up popped the frightful photo you see before you, this hideous slab of yellow and brown depravity looking very much like a barnacle scraped off the bottom of a truck, to which anyone with a functioning anima will naturally recoil in abject and understandable dread.

This is NASCAR’s version of going to the penalty box for an extended period of time. Kurt got bounced from Penske because of anger-management issues (bickering with his crew and such). Although he found a ride with Finch, the team neither has the manpower or the dollars to compete with the big guns on the Cup circuit.

Though youth and inexperience kept the U.S. women's figure skaters from the medals, Evan Lysacek jumped and spun to Americans' first gold in the men's event since 1988. The four-man bobsled won its first gold medal since 1948, and four U.S. athletes helped the nation to four medals in Nordic combined -- its first ever in the ski-and-ski-jumping sport.
But it would be a serious mistake to imagine that personal performance is what matters in combat. Combat is not a contest between individuals, like poker or tennis; it is a team event whose success depends on group cooperation and morale. So the behavior that concerns us is not individual achievement but the social dynamics of relationships and groups. The issue is whether and how the presence of openly declared homosexuals in the ranks affects the solidarity of the unit.

The plant produces a durable, fuel-efficient truck that continues to have a place in times of high energy costs, Zimmerman said. St. Paul has long been one of Ford's best plants, he said, with one exception: It lacks integrated metal stamping, which means big parts such as hoods and doors must be shipped in.
While Christian's TCU stint (56-73) has been anything but successful, his Kent State run - 2002 through 2008 (137-59) - was one of the best in league history, as he never finished lower than second in the tough MAC East Division.

Swindle, the new pastry chef, doesn't miss a beat. Pre-dessert might be a thimble of plum sorbet or a glass of coconut horchata. An individual blackberry pie has a fragile short crust filled with luscious dark berries and served with an utterly enchanting wild fennel ice cream that strikes a perfect balance between sweet and herbal. Though strawberry shortcake skimps on the Harry's berries, the shortcake is marvelous. O'Henry peach cobbler arrives in the oval cast-iron casserole with a biscuit topping and a small dish of gorgeous vanilla ice cream, a great example of an all-American dessert. And I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of silky dark custard tart with a gorgeous, sliced-plum compote.
The major oil companies, including Chevron, are struggling with a slowdown in production. New fields are tougher to find and expensive to develop. And many of the best reserves are owned by foreign governments that reduce the amount of oil that companies can sell as prices rise.
The report revealed that Multnomah County refused to allow its employees to be interviewed by internal affairs investigators until after they were deposed in a civil lawsuit, which was pending at the time. That meant internal affairs waited until April 2008 to interview sheriff's Deputy Bret Burton, who by then had been hired by Portland police. (Consultants said the bureau shouldn't hire an officer from another agency while the officer is under investigation.) Portland police did not want to interview officers who were more involved in the case until they interviewed Burton, but finally decided to interview the officers in November and December 2007.

Those were great days. That's probably the loudest of any crowd I've ever been involved with. People would be at the arena an hour before the game and they'd already be stomping, "Let's Go Cavs!" The whole building would be rocking.
Confusion about whether the Coast Guard or the EPA should take the lead complicated the response, all the parties said. Frequent turnover among Coast Guard personnel also complicates coordinated spill response; two of the Coast Guard's key responders on the New Dawn incident have already transferred to other posts.

2. I read a Tweet the other night, sweeping the dirt out from under the, uh, rug. It was about Kansas coach Bill Self, and it made the same claim -- that Self's immaculately coiffed hair was not what it appeared to be -- as my friend, the retired Toledo Blade columnist John Gugger, suspected. In 2001, I was in Dayton, covering an NCAA sub-regional, when a crush of officials and players near the court brought me to a halt, inches from Self and the Illinois team he coached at the time. Peering intently, I confirmed Gugger's suspicion, due to a small strip of bald skin visible only at close range. I never wrote it, but now I've got to defend my peerless investigative powers and my buddy's uncanny instincts.

In addition to choosing the density of the dye job, Lissak says clients also specify the color from an extensive lens palette, often to match a particular outfit or accessory.
It's been five years since the housing bubble burst, yet hundreds of thousands of California homeowners remain in default and en route to foreclosure. Some of these troubled borrowers will benefit from new consumer protections included in a nationwide settlement that five major banks agreed to in February, including a requirement that foreclosure proceedings wait until the bank considers a modified mortgage that would be less costly to borrower and lender alike. Those protections, however, extend no further than the five banks and the loans they service. This week, state lawmakers are set to take up a series of mortgage-related bills backed by Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, beginning with a measure (AB 1602) to enshrine the national settlement's safeguards into California law and apply them to all borrowers in the state. Also included in the package are proposals to improve lenders' record keeping and extend the statute of limitations for prosecuting certain mortgage-related crimes.
So, just how fast is the Sellwood Bridge falling down? Apparently, that is up for debate. Clackamas County Chairwoman Charlotte Lehan took a peek at a Multnomah County study and used the data to conclude the creaky span would have to be shut down within eight years. But maybe not, depending on how you look at the stats and projections -- adding more fuel to the fire over the vote that would block Clackamas County residents from chipping in for bridge replacement costs through a vehicle-registration fee.

The Volt operates as an electric vehicle for up to about 35 miles, and then it shifts to power from a gas engine. That translates to the equivalent of 94 mpg in electric mode and 37 mpg overall, according to the EPA. The Leaf is electric only and is rated the equivalent of 99 mpg from the EPA. The EPA says the Leaf has a range of about 75 miles, but there is no fallback once you run out of battery power; you need to recharge the batteries to get back on the road. The Prius is a hybrid that operates in an electric mode for brief intervals, boosting its mileage rating to 50 mpg from combined city-highway driving.

Flanked by two docking stations — that is, a pair of desks and chairs — he reminisces with the occasional video clip. His stories unspool in rough chronological order as he highlights his various activities and passions — NASA! “Boston Legal”! Priceline! — as well as drops Jewish-mother jokes and a couple of references to his having “a rocket up my ass.” In space, no one can hear you groan.
"It doesn't hit me the same way, like the last time we were here in '07," Johnson said. "You know, you at least had (Michael) Strahan that was here — a guy that I actually spent training camp with.

The dishes each reflect a moment in Williams' culinary evolution. The beets are inspired by a dish he learned to make as an extern at the famed New York restaurant Le Bernardin, the "prosciutto" is a recent invention that exemplifies Williams' skills as an innovator and technician, and the daube serves as a tribute to Eddie Neill and Cafe Provencal where Williams worked as a young cook.

Lesch cited the Dakota County case, if proven, as an example of why the law is needed. "Some people are irresponsible and need to be regulated to ensure they are following the same standards that everyone else follows," Lesch said.
Newman says, "Motherhood prepared me for TV writing. It taught me to focus and work hard no matter how tired I was. That was huge for me. I think I was somewhat lazy before I became a mother. Once I was a mother, because I had so little time to spend on things other than my child, I made my time away from her count. I used my time way better. I decided what I wanted to do and went for it."

Survey the tufted leather banquettes, the stainless flattop bubbling over with fried eggs, the oversize mirrors, the bowling alley-length Zinc bar and the bow tie-shaped ceramic tile, and you might write off Au Cheval as some kind of cute pedestrian brasserie/greasy spoon hybrid, the kind of place you amble into a little tipsy at two in the morning, not so much seeking transcendent fare, but merely because it's there.

Bunning wanted to force Democrats to find ways to finance the bill so that it wouldn't add to the deficit, but his move sparked a political tempest that subjected Republicans to withering media coverage and cost the party politically. Bunning's support among Republicans was dwindling, while Democrats used to being on the defensive over health care and the deficit seemed to relish a battle that could reinforce their argument that Republicans are bent on obstruction of President Barack Obama's agenda at any cost.

Sound budget decisions for Portland's water and sewer utilities can only occur with a long-term view of the system's needs. Consequently, both utilities routinely update five-year forecasts of operating and capital requirements and the rate increases necessary to fund them.

For ratepayers to accept forecast rates and support annual budgets for the water and sewer systems, the city needs to ensure that budget decisions are made in the open and reflect highest priorities.
