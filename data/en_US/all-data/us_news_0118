"Wrecking Ball": The latest album from Bruce Springsteen, due Tuesday, gets its title from an object that the Boss presumably would like to use to tear down corporate greed. In songs like "Easy Money" and "We Take Care of Our Own," popular music's venerable conscience makes it clear what he thinks of those who amassed fortunes in a house-of-cards economy while ordinary people's bank accounts were crushed. Bruce may belong to the 1% technically, but it's safe to say that 99% of this record speaks for the little guy.

Practice restraint. One really fabulous work of art, well placed, has more impact than lots of smaller pieces. And it might be all the art your garden needs. Buy what you love, not what someone tells you to buy because it's "art." You're going to have a piece of art, especially a statement piece, for a long time. If you can't afford to make the purchase now, put in a plant to serve as focal point and placeholder, knowing that when you can afford the piece you want, you'll sacrifice the plant for the art.

Take, for example, Stix, Baer and Fuller. I remember it because the chain had a store at St. Clair Square in Fairview Heights, Ill., near where I grew up in Collinsville. The chain got its start in 1892 when Julius and Sigmund Baer and their brother-in-law, Aaron Fuller, went into business with Charles Stix to open the Grand Leader. The original store was on Washington Avenue in downtown St. Louis. The store name was later changed to Stix, Baer and Fuller. Eventually, the stores were acquired by Dillard's, which rebranded them with that company's name.

My parents were divorced when I was younger. My father was not in the home with me. Sure, I had a relationship with him, but it wasn't the same as if he had actually lived in the house. I explain in the book how I had to look at other men as positive role models, like my pastor or my assistant coach at Syracuse, or my grandfather. These were positive men that I had to have in my life for guidance.

The best material in Tom Zoellner's "A Safeway in Arizona: What the Gabrielle Giffords Shooting Tells Us About the Grand Canyon State and Life in America" comes at the beginning: a moment-by-moment breakdown of the events of Jan. 8, 2011, when, during a Congress on Your Corner event at a Safeway store in Tucson, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner opened fire with a 9-millimeter Glock, wounding Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and killing six others in a rampage that took "approximately fifteen seconds from start to finish." These are the facts, and Zoellner, a former reporter at the Arizona Republic and the San Francisco Chronicle, does a good job of setting them out for us, breaking down the chaos and giving it an order, telling us something of the victims, who they were and where they were standing, as well as the small, essential acts of bravery that prevented Loughner, in all likelihood, from causing further harm.

I didn't have the Blues on the radar screen until 1975, when I landed at Mizzou as a freshman. Mike Liut was all that for the Note in the pre-Ornest Era, stealing games with swagger. It's safe to say the Blues haven't had anybody like him since. Greg Millen and Rick Wamsley had big moments, but just passed through. Curtis Joseph was often spectacular, but he suffered a full meltdown when Mike Keenan leaned on him. Grant Fuhr was past his prime. Roman Turek was emotionally fragile. Brent Johnson was immature . . . and so on and so forth. Jaroslav Halak might become special, but we've seen his unstable side as well. So Liut is the man.

This includes Love, who was idled with symptoms from a concussion.

Maybe not so great for David S. Ferriero, archivist of the United States. In a ceremony at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., attended by dozens of media, government officials and interested spectators, Ferriero declared the 1940 census officially open — and then promptly was unable to access the data because of heavy traffic to the site.

"Then God said, 'Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb that yields seed, and the fruit tree that yields fruit according to its kind, whose seed is in itself, on the earth'; and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, the herb that yields seed according to its kind, and the tree that yields fruit, whose seed is in itself according to its kind. And God saw that it was good" (Gen 1:11-12; NKJV).

College baseball: San Francisco State at Santa Clara, 6 p.m.
Half a Jidori chicken arrives crisp and golden in its cast-iron skillet, bursting with juices. Boneless short ribs in all their beefy goodness are served simply with grated fresh horseradish root. And that grilled beer-brined pork chop tastes like itself, not just salt. For something on the lighter side, there's a thick cut of roasted salmon in a gentle smoked tomato butter.
Americans have seen all of those conflicts before. They're frustrating, but they could be resolved by a responsible political establishment with a commitment to honesty, a bit of courage and a sense of obligation to work within the constraints of fiscal sanity.

If those two events are not of equal significance to St. Louis commerce and culture, they share the relative rarity of having survived on recordings. Most radio and early television broadcasts were beamed live and unrecorded into the ozone, never to be heard a second time. But a few ended up on heavy phonograph disc or audiotape.
PolitiFact New Jersey found that Rothman is wrong, because Pascrell -- just like Rothman -- voted for a House bill that included a public option. A U.S. Senate bill, which became the final law, did not include the public option.
Sam Burkhardt, 70, of Phoenix, counts himself as one of those with mixed feelings. He is neither stridently in favor of nor opposed to the nation's toughest immigration law, which requires police to inquire about legal status if they reasonably suspect a person is in the country illegally.
The agency had thrived under governors ranging from Bob Graham to Jeb Bush, with all of them touting DCA as a guard for both residents and the land.

While there's sophistication and subtlety in some dishes, the chef knows when to pump up the volume. The New York steak ($28) is served with a creamy rich bearnaise sauce, adding a heady licorice scent to the subtle grassiness of the nicely charred beef. Rosemary perks up the exceptional thin-cut fries alongside, with a hot tingle of freshly made aioli.
The large menu, executed by chef and partner Parke Ulrich, is based on local and sustainable seafood, some of which is bought directly off the boat. With the restaurant's watery vistas, the shellfish platter is the thing to order. It looks like edible art, and features a cascade of lobster, crab, five shrimp, three clams, six oysters, Florida stone crab claws and a small ramekin of scallop ceviche. It's impressive in its scope - and its $90 price tag. If diners don't want the traditional chilled platter, they can choose a wood-oven-roasted platter that includes some of the same ingredients .
What: The Relief Pitcher is the archetypal, friendly roadside tavern -- cold beer, full bar and sports on TV. It's a place where Seaside locals meet for a game of pool; a place where work clothes or clam-digging outfits are met without judgment; and a place known for mouth-watering burgers.

"You haven't seen me in a boat, yet," said Whipple, chuckling. "I think that's why a lot of my teammates appreciate me. I know how to turn it on and turn it off. More important, when I say something it really needs to happen when I say it needs to happen for us to maintain our boat speed or increase our boat speed."
If approved, the consolidation would place NLRB employees in St. Louis under the leadership of a regional director headquartered in Kansas City. The St. Louis regional director post is currently vacant.
Nothing on this show really increased my desire to purchase Extreme Rules. I expect Punk and Chris Jericho to put on a heck of a show; I didn't need their bits to sell me on that. John Cena and Brock Lesnar have already done their part to hype the show. The Randy Orton-Kane interactions may have actually decreased my interest in their blow-off match and Daniel Bryan and Sheamus' angle didn't really do much.
Port Authority officials released a video of the crime in August of 2010, and were finally able to identify Corley after an inmate in an unrelated case came forward and said he knew someone in the footage. Corley was arrested in Newark on Feb. 2, and Bey was captured five hours later.

Best Buy, based in Richfield, Minn., posted a loss of $1.7 billion last quarter. It faces an increasing threat from shoppers who use its large stores as showrooms for merchandise they purchase elsewhere online for less.
It's smart and effective, it turns out, to keep young offenders in their home communities, close to local rehabilitative programming and mentors but with probation-officer monitoring to help them resist the lure of bad influences; or, when more direct supervision is needed, in local probation camps within visiting distance of family. More rigorous data tracking from across the nation shows, not surprisingly, that wards who committed lower-level crimes do best when kept apart from more violent offenders. The two populations respond best to different kinds of supervision and living conditions.
No. 10-ranked Sunnyside Elementary in Garden Grove soared to success by rolling out a simple, easy-to-understand program designed to put kids on the college track. About 66 percent of Sunnyside's students come from low-income families, and about 60 percent are designated English learners, with Vietnamese, Korean and Spanish the primary languages spoken at home.

In the two years that have followed, Tuohy's big grants have remained elusive.
Indiana became the first state this year to cut off all government funds to Planned Parenthood, fulfilling conservatives' goal of financially weakening organizations that provide abortions. Other conservative states have considered such action in recent years but backed away under the threat of loss of all federal money for their Medicaid programs.
The son's ideas for the future direction of the Cathedral were drastically different from the father's. Robert A. Schuller wanted the Cathedral to reach out to communities. He wanted to expand missions. But, most importantly, Robert Anthony Schuller says, he was for better governance, more accountability and better financial control.
Finished with the Robbins, he strolled into the wings singing a few bars of "Honey Bun" before shifting gears to work on a recent ballet created for him, Christopher Wheeldon's "An American in Paris." He got in the mood by bellowing "Gotta dance!" with Gene Kelly flair before working through his sections of the ballet, in which his role is a distillation of Kelly in the 1951 film, encountering an array of Parisian archetypes as well as a romantic adventure or two.

I was lonely, nursing a broken heart after the sweetness of my "happily ever after" turned sour. My one bright spot was my job at the Humane Society Silicon Valley. Still a little wary of human relationships, I decided to pursue one of the canine variety and adopt a dog. My wish list: mature, quiet, intellectual, a canine Gregory Peck if you will. Yet, one year later, I remained dogless. None had caught my eye or touched my heart.
"We had fallen through the cracks," Warden recalled. "It wasn't like these days when I could call anybody up on my cell phone. That night still remains one of the eeriest sights I've ever seen. There was simply nobody around in this big city. Simply nobody. Detroit, the place where I was so determined to pitch, had become a ghost town."

Verbinski went to Industrial Light & Magic for the animation, with "Rango" the visual effects house's first and hopefully far from its last full-length animated feature. The company certainly has a history in character creation from its inception, when George Lucas set it up for "Star Wars." Since then, it's left a deep imprint on many films, including "Terminator," "Transformers" and "Avatar." But there is a freshness you can feel in "Rango" that comes from having new hands on deck.

Five days after the escape, a Corrections team scoured Kingman to determine what security flaws led to the escape. Their scathing assessment, described in an internal Corrections memo, listed the broken alarm, eight burned-out perimeter lights, other broken security equipment, and a lax, high-turnover culture in which MTC's green, undertrained staff and rookie supervisors ignored alarms, left long gaps between patrols of the perimeter, left doors leading out of some buildings open and unwatched, didn't alert the state or local police until hours after the escape, and failed in all manner of basic security practices.
Well, Mr. Holley, these victims weren’t shot by a man supposedly protecting the neighborhood, while the victim only had a bag of Skittles & a hoodie. His crime was being black & an assumption of guilt for wearing a hoodie.

When Dolores Gomez, 78, moved from San Francisco to Brisbane in 1941, the population was about 2,500. She found it a perfect place for an 11-year-old kid to grow up in. Along with her friends, she waxed big pieces of cardboard to slide down the hills on, hiked up San Bruno Mountain, hunted for frogs in Crocker Park and, when near a ranch, cooled off on hot summer days by taking a dip in water troughs.
Evert said the group should not have sent council members mass emails that looked identical. "Maybe all those people are real people, but they didn't go out and have 800 people send the same letter the same day," the mayor said.
I was addicted to Vietnamese food long before I strolled the frenzied and frenetic streets of Hanoi and sailed the karst-populated waters of Ha Long Bay — and dipped into neighboring communities in Laos, Cambodia and Thailand. The Southeast Asian cuisine is fresh and often lean — surprisingly so, given how flavorful it is. And from a steaming bowl of pho (pronounced fuh) for breakfast to a perfectly grilled shrimp dish for lunch, it's simple (and delightful) to eat it three times a day.
"You’re in or you’re out," said Phil Garafoli, an employee in what was formerly Auditor Frank Russo’s office. "It is what it is."

Orchestra officials say audience members won't notice the reductions.
Yet the commission thus far has been largely absent without leave. This isn't an accident. Under Reagan, conservatives began to cut away at the commission, reducing its budget and staff. In theory, the eight-member commission is bipartisan, with no party having more than four members. Then, under George Bush, two Republican activists changed their registration to "independent," enabling conservatives to hold six seats on the commission, rendering it less useful. By 2011, Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, issued a report concluding that the commission was "so debilitated as to be considered moribund."

Then there was a different type of scare, one that I chose: I ziplined at heights of up to nearly 1,500 feet over the Copper Canyon and tap-danced across two wobbly hanging bridges, albeit while wearing a helmet and being firmly attached to a steel cable that would prevent me from catapulting over the edge and into the depths below.

A: Nuclear workers at the damaged reactor site may get high enough doses to cause radiation sickness. Less intense radiation from airborne sources reaching civilians in Japan could cause elevated rates of cancer, especially thyroid cancer. The risks are hard to measure. Fallout from nuclear bomb testing in Nevada during the 1950s exposed some people in Utah to as much as 16 times the dose of radiation they would have otherwise received from natural sources. These downwinders showed elevated rates of thyroid cancer, but researchers still can't precisely calculate the risk. After the Chernobyl disaster, rates of thyroid cancer rose to five to eight times the expected level in the most highly exposed children living nearby.

To resuscitate this play, we needed an A team. But Gregory Mosher's star-studded production -- the cast also includes Kiefer Sutherland, Chris Noth and Jim Gaffigan -- is a train wreck. Actually, that implies some kind of momentum, of which there's none onstage, aside from Patric's tumble.
But the Quinnipiac poll also showed even stronger support for increasing public workers’ share of health insurance and pension costs. Some public workers, however, already pay as much as, if not more, than the health insurance and pension costs SB5 prescribes.
NEWARK — Federal prosecutor Joseph Minish was more than halfway through his 4 ½-hour closing argument today in the murder trial of Paul Bergrin, when he went straight at Bergrin's veracity, telling the jury that the once-prominent defense lawyer had purposefully tried to fool the jury by leaving out key information when questioning a witness.

The good news: Couples can learn to stop nagging. Early in their marriage, Ms. Pfeiffer, now 62, repeatedly reminded her husband about household tasks and became more demanding when he ignored her. "If I was asking him to take care of something that mattered to me and he was blowing me off, that made me feel like I didn't matter," she says.
The course was short but thorough, featuring most of the challenges racers would encounter at an event. There were two-by-fours to ride over, a zig-zag chute, and three hurdles spaced a few feet apart. Coaches from Century and Raleigh broke the course into three parts, allowing me to master each skill individually before trying a full circuit.

The winners of those four games are rewarded with a game two days later against a No. 1 seed. Gee, thanks. Eighth-seeded Iowa State vs. No. 9 Connecticut looks like a terrific matchup in the South Regional. But guess what. The winner gets overall No. 1 seed Kentucky. In this case, it would be better to have a lower seed.
The Syrian revolution is going to spiral into something awful. The longer it lasts, the more people die and the greater the chance of it spilling across borders. The plan, as it is now, is to wait for the inevitable -- the failure of Kofi Annan and, after that, the predictable failure of an arms embargo that will weaken the opposition much more than it will Assad. Somehow, multiple failures are supposed to lead to success. That's worse than Munich. It's madness.

When Bradley was succeeded by Republican Richard Riordan in 1993, the African American community found itself mostly on the outside at City Hall. The three most prominent connections to the Bradley era were City Atty. James K. Hahn, son of Kenny Hahn, who held the 2nd District seat for 40 years, Parks and Ridley-Thomas. Like his father, James Hahn was popular in the black community, and when Riordan endorsed a Hahn rival in the 1997 election for city attorney, Hahn easily won because of strong support from African American voters, as well as others.

In all of South Africa, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more potent symbol of those old ways than the Voortrekker Monument at the edge of town.

The first step in curbing the nagging cycle, experts say, is to admit that you are stuck in a bad pattern. You are fighting about fighting.

Among the movie's many revelations is the fact -- I'm taking the factuality on faith -- that the Vatican library's most treasured manuscripts are stored in sealed chambers under a partial vacuum. At certain points during the screening I attended, when the action was interrupted by major eruptions of information, a sealed chamber under partial vacuum might have described the screening room. With a running time of 138 minutes, "Angels & Demons" is a serious slog. Still, it's an odd kind of a slog that manages to keep you partially engaged, even at its most esoteric or absurd, despite an endlessly excitable choir and Hans Zimmer's pitiless score. Tom Hanks is a companionable presence, as always, and he gets to run and jump much more often than he did in "The Da Vinci Code." Stellan Skarsgrd is the Swiss Guard's stern big cheese, Ewan McGregor is the quick-witted Camerlengo and Armin Mueller-Stahl's gimlet-eyed cardinal exudes villainy with every whispered syllable.
The first is that Barnes & Noble needs to get the lead out and let people run these applications on the Nook Color without having to jail-break it. Obviously they want to block Amazon's Kindle app, because they want customers to buy books from BarnesandNoble.com. But why block everything else? Why should I have to invalidate the warranty in order to make their product more attractive?

Sen. Linda Higgins, DFL-Minneapolis, argued that the city charter included many outdated points, including one concerning cutting ice out of the city’s lakes.

In a pair of scathing audits, Chiang warned that the East Bay city may have to pay back the $2 million it received in 2009-10, and because the "glaring holes" in the city's accounting may have existed before that time, the city's liability to the state and federal governments may be higher.

Scrappers 9, Jammers 2: Cleveland's No. 1 draft pick Francisco Lindor singled in his first at-bat of his professional debut, and later scored on a base hit. For the night, the shortstop was 1-for-3, as Mahoning Valley defeated Jamestown, N.Y., in a New York-Penn league game in Niles. Lindor also flied to left and grounded to second. Lindor also turned the pivot on two 4-6-3 double plays.

What made him most upset was the way mortgages are structured, with the bulk of the monthly payment going to pay interest at the beginning of the loan term. Fast-forward eight years, when we refinanced our mortgage to buy the new home. That's when Gerry realized that of the $94,391 he'd paid out on his old mortgage over those years, just $12,035 had gone to paying down principal. His reaction? It was ugly.

Our students in the inner city, struggling to meet proficiency standards in the current formulation of the HSPA, will be the greatest beneficiaries of a new HSPA. The current assessment is unfair and fails to meet the state’s own objectives. It is not aligned to all of New Jersey’s Core Curriculum Content Standards and, most important, it does not test students on the things they should know to be actively engaged in our democracy and free market economy. It is time for a change.

In the Middle Ages, crossing the Alps was like sending a satellite to Mars. Nowadays, passing between Italy and Switzerland is about as challenging as going from Missouri to Illinois. At a defunct guard gate north of Lake Como, I had to buy a $45 pass, good for a year of driving in Switzerland, which is a European anomaly. It didn't join the EU, uses the Swiss franc instead of the euro and is trilingual, as I noted when the signs changed from Italian to German on the far side of a tunnel and later from German to French.
As for 2012, Smith will earn $4.5 million, in the form of a $4 million base salary and a $500,000 roster bonus. Before the restructuring, he had been scheduled to make $10 million this year.

Mathias Kiwanuka recently got a three-year contract extension worth a total of $21.75 million that included an $8.5 million signing bonus and $10.95 million in guaranteed money.

It’s a job he did exceedingly well in the 24 games that closed the season, an 18-6 stretch that took the Knicks from the outside looking into the playoffs to the No. 7 seed, that immediately elevated the team’s level of effort and defense. And Woodson, a confident man, has not been shy about reminding everyone about how different the team looked across the last six weeks than it did across the season’s first 2 1/2 months. And that’s fair.

This wasn't an isolated incident, either. In my work for SmarterTravel.com, I regularly check flash sale deals. And I quickly learned to ignore the posted discount or regular price claims; instead, I check through Expedia, Hotels.com, or some other third-party source. And all too often, I see repeats of the example experience: Last week I spotted a claim for a discounted room at $299, compared with a "regular" price of $689, only to find the same room through a third-party OTA at the same $299. As I look at these flash sale websites, I find no general pattern of accuracy or deception. Any one site can and often does post really good deals and phony deals at the same time.

The colt who carries the family name of owner Kendall Hansen breaks from a favorable No. 14 post, where the nation's leading jockey, Ramon Dominguez, can gauge the front-runners and try to keep the speedster fresh for the stretch run.

In Ohio, the president noted that he'd nominated Cordray last summer but that Senate Republicans had blocked the appointment, not because Cordray was unqualified, but because "they don't agree with the law that set up a consumer watchdog in the first place," he said.

To sustain its economic future, a country needs reasonable taxes, an affordable public sector and an economic climate conducive to job creation. This is not exactly a blinding revelation in the United States or much of Europe, which has seen painful encounters with economic reality in Italy, Greece and Spain. But in France, it seems to be a well-kept secret.

Until very recently, the common factor for these groups was that life in the East End was always meager. Crime and disease were a constant menace. This stems from the fact that the area was originally not part of London at all; it was outside the walled medieval city. The residential areas were mostly slums, inhabited by poorly paid dockworkers and those who toiled in dark industries - tanneries, soap making and gunpowder factories, industries that wouldn't be tolerated in the city.
One faction argues the city shouldn't impose a camping ban without adequate resources in place, including enough shelter space.
Susanna Phillips picked up the concert's operatic current with "Non mi dir" from "Don Giovanni," which Donna Anna sings to her fiancé as an explanation of why she fends off his advances in the wake of her father's death.

4 Portland filmmaker Matt McCormick's wistful, affecting feature, "Some Days Are Better Than Others," has a distinctly Portland flavor. The characters are underemployed and a bit aimless, living low-budget lives, vaguely dissatisfied, but yearning for something to give their lives meaning. While the presence in the cast of Carrie Brownstein might make it seem that "Some Days" is a "Portlandia" clone, McCormick's film is his own vision, with characteristically evocative images, and attention to the subtleties of passing mood. The film also stars James Mercer of the Shins, who's very likable as a directionless guy fresh from a busted relationship. Available on DVD and Blu-ray; $19.98-$24.98; palisadestartan.com

Today the white elephant  it cost about $650 million to build and possibly twice that, if roads and utilities to serve it are included  is an object of national ridicule, a metaphor for Spain's crazy construction bubble and an example of the kind of spending that has made Spain as well as Greece and Italy poster children for Europe's economic malaise.

But the recovery that was limping gamely along in 2011 has lost whatever modest momentum it had, and the situation has become increasingly dire. The latest jobs numbers are not good, and the 14 million unemployed in this country need help. Such circumstances cry out for a short-term government boost to employers — whether it's in the form of government contracts or tax policies that encourage expansion. This, too, is a reasonable economic principle to be followed.

In fact the whole film feels a bit like a strangely altered Herzog, holding on to some of his obsessions but avoiding much of his ambitious sweep.

Ernst Loosen, a top winemaker in Germany's Mosel region, home to some of the most famous and most aromatically intense Rieslings in the world, has long acknowledged English as a necessary marketing tool and has put English words on his labels for years. One reason is that he exports nearly all (90%) of his wines, unlike most of his peers. I had lunch with Mr. Loosen a few weeks ago while he was in New York to show off a few of his 2011 wines. (The 2011 Riesling vintage has been much praised and anticipated, and many of the wines are just now arriving in stores.)

Perhaps Taylor was distracted by the men who now flitted through her life (including two more husbands, U.S. Sen. John Warner of Virginia and car dealer Larry Fortensky). Perhaps she liked the easy paychecks too much. But after “A Little Night Music” in 1977, her hard-won position as a serious film actress was pretty much abdicated.

Shea has that ability at a very high level."

Only the shortsighted would consider Michigan State sophomore center Adreian Payne a failure -- the five-star out of Dayton, Ohio, who too often looked like he wasn't worth five cents as a freshman. But this is how the recruiting rankings obsession has poisoned the well in college basketball, creating an accelerated maturation course that's actually unattainable for a freshman but doesn't matter as long as the kid lands in the NBA as quickly as possible.

This 56,000-square-foot landmark with a giant yellow inflatable duck usually perched on top has become much more than founders Carolyn Nelson and Reba Wehrly ever envisioned. In 1982, the two Santa Clara women were hoping for "a small area where young children could go," said Nelson, who gave up a finance career with Fairchild Semiconductor to raise her son. Wehrly had moved from Boston, where one of the first children's museums in the country was housed in an old Victorian.

Christie will also propose converting the state’s property tax rebate checks into direct credits on homeowners’ tax bills, eliminating what was once considered an almost untouchable fixture of New Jersey government and politics because of its popularity among voters.

Fast-forward one year shy of a quarter century. Many things have changed, yet a few have remained the same. The former include Vidal's sale of La Rondinaia and his full-time return, at the age of 80, to Los Angeles. Among the latter is the latest campaign of the now-soon-to-be-ex-mayor of Oakland, Jerry Brown, whose election mania Vidal long ago questioned, now running against L.A. City Attorney Rocky Delgadillo in the Democratic primary for state attorney general. It is easy to imagine Gore, the aging lion of the left, grumpily surveying the scorched earth of modern American politics from his Olympian Hollywood Hills haunt and acidly wondering what in God's name is Brown thinking? Or, rather, if.
As I previously stated, I used the time trades to advance my education. With the assistance of my fellow firefighters, I attended local colleges. I attained a bachelor of science degree in criminal justice, followed with a master's degree in labor relations and human resources. During the time I was in school and working as a firefighter, I also participated in negotiating labor agreements between my local union and the city administration. At no time did the issue of time trading come up for discussions, primarily due to the fact no one, labor or management, had problems with the process. Again, I emphasize this fact: Honest and fair was the process, and all parties worked to keep it that way.

"With the economy being what it is, it's understandable. But what was most troubling was that there was no room for dialogue. It was made very apparent to us that, at the end of the day, it's a business, and businesses are designed make money. And to any actor or artist, that is hard to accept."
