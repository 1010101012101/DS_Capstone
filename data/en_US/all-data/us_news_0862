If you have a question about marijuana, now is the time to ask, she said. And they did. Why do people get hungry after smoking? What chemical makes it addictive? Why do eyes get red?

SFMade's budget also has grown, to $500,000 a year, with funding from city agencies, banks and other companies, including Google and Levi Strauss.
The city of Cleveland still has not done nearly enough to honor one of the great suffragists, civil rights pioneers, role models, and amateur historians to ever call this place home. Now is the time. I don't know what a fitting tribute is: A bridge, a park, a school, a building? All I know is that respect should be paid.

The movie also inspired a pre-show spelling bee, open to all ages for tickets to a prize raffle. And though contestants were allowed only 10 seconds to think, 30 seconds to spell, this wasn't the usual white-knuckles-in-the-spotlight atmosphere of serious spelling bees. Misspellers could come back for a second shot.

"The signal danger of life in a godless society is that it lacks reminders of the transcendent and therefore leaves us unprepared for disappointment and eventual annihilation. When God is dead, human beings — much to their detriment — are at danger of taking psychological center-stage. They imagine themselves to be commanders of their own destiny," De Botton writes.
øToday, more workers have a 401(k) defined contribution plan and an IRA instead of a pension. While federal and state employees and a relative few corporate retirees will still enjoy all three legs, most are left with a pair of stilts: Social Security and personal retirement savings.

“The single biggest determining factor on sports performance is the central nervous system readiness, i.e. your brain,” he said. “If we had that many kids doing it, we wouldn’t be 34-6. (And) it’s not just doing it the day before the game – it’s about practice. We win because of how hard we practice. I see our kids every day at practice, and if we saw signs... I haven’t seen signs.

Putting these personal documents onstage isn't a new idea, as anyone who has seen Griffin Theatre's touring production of "Letters Home," which also features correspondence from soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, can attest. But Elizabeth Margolius and Terry McCabe's decision to intersperse the contemporary experiences of soldiers on the front with a moving selection of Civil War-era songs — from well-known classics such as "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "When Johnny Comes Marching Home" to somewhat lesser-known ballads such as Stephen Foster's "Was My Brother in the Battle?" — adds undeniable emotional heft. Classic spirituals such as "Michael, Row the Boat Ashore" remind us of the human cost of slavery.

There aren't too many places where you can find a pasta plate loaded with seven medium-large shrimp and four very plump in-the-shell clams for such a price. And you'll have to look long and hard to be able to pay so little to satisfy a scallop craving with a half-dozen nicely seared specimens.
Chicken picatta is Italian. Robert likes the dish enough to add his own interpretation  thin slices of chicken, breaded zucchini and lemon butter caper sauce.

But polls agree that much of the population remains undecided — as high as 56 percent according to one.

North Korea is separated from the more prosperous South Korea by a heavily militarized frontier, and access to the country remains strictly controlled. The communist government's monopoly on information began to erode in the late 1990s, when famine led to less reliance on and trust in the state, Kretchun said.
The look of Nua, which means new in Gaelic, is sleek and cool, and is a pleasant contrast to the warm Mediterranean flavors favored by Bautista, who broadly interprets the cuisine of three countries.

Warren's return — he signed a two-year contract last summer — is one reason the Broncos haven't done anything at defensive tackle in free agency this year.

Chris Christie has advertised his availability, but the New Jersey governor is too charismatic; he'd remind everyone that the guy at the top is as scintillating as a plate of vanilla. Jeb Bush has the wrong last name. Bob McDonnell, the Virginia governor, wants the job so badly that he's running TV ads touting himself, but he won't help Romney with women, not after signing the bill that requires women to undergo ultrasounds before an abortion. Mitch Daniels, the Indiana governor, has home-state fiscal woes - and he was George W. Bush's budget guy when the surpluses vanished and the red ink began to cascade.

I'm not sure how much the league can control in order to pump up the suspense, short of adding an element of surprise and shock by letting an Al Davis hologram pick for every team. You'd expect him to pick Andrew Luck for the Colts. But given the Raiders' penchant for stunning the crowd and the commentators by over-reaching on selections, Hologram Al might just hand deliver the Colts a kick returner from Bethune-Cookman.
The limited-edition collection, which will be available through March 6, will include apparel, handbags and scarves. The price range is $19.99 to $59.99. If the Wu collection catches on like last fall's Missoni launch at Target, here's hoping the retailer is prepared both in store and online.

Matta keeps putting up 20-win seasons and Big Ten championships, and maybe this team has a Final Four run in it. Texas, Kansas, Pitt and, especially, Duke, if injured freshman guard Kyrie Irving comes back, are all formidable, too.
At first glance, Loyola's resume this season is equally — if not more impressive — than the Blue Jays'.

Put it this way: If something like the financial crisis of 2008 had occurred in, say, 1971 -- the year Richard Nixon declared that "I am now a Keynesian in economic policy" -- Washington would probably have responded fairly effectively. There would have been a broad bipartisan consensus in favor of strong action, and there would also have been wide agreement about what kind of action was needed.

"If I had anybody else I could talk to about this stuff, I'd go there," Nick says. Monroe grudgingly shares his savvy about the ziegevolk creatures, who have a mysteriously powerful effect on their prey, like "preachers," "game show hosts," and "actor types," says Monroe. They give off a sort of scent, he says: "Chicks can't resist it." Monroe goes down Memory Lane, recalling a short, tubby old acquaintance named Elvis Greenspan who really had a way with the ladies, courtesy of his ziegevolk mojo. Oh, and if one of these goat guys touch you, Monroe adds, they own you.

Another brilliant season, another heartbreaking semifinal loss for Tottenville. It doesn’t get any tougher than Saturday’s 20-17 overtime loss to Erasmus Hall in Huguenot, the Pirates leading 14-0 at one point late in the first half, only to fall agonizingly short. With so many key losses, from Syracuse-bound wide receiver Alvin Cornelius to middle linebacker Kenny Coughlin, the Tots may not get so close next year.

It's safe to say that fight has been won. Alameda now has vigorous requirements for historic review, as I can attest, having paid several hundred dollars for city approval to tear down a nondescript, rotting wooden shed and replace it with a garage that would match the architectural lines and stucco exterior of my 1920s-era Mediterranean. I appreciate the city's newfound vigilance on protecting older structures, even if the fees seemed excessive.

J. Edgar is, of course, J. Edgar Hoover, the longtime director of the FBI, rumored to be a closeted homosexual who maybe dabbled in cross-dressing, as well. All of these aspects of his life are covered, as is his opportunism. Hoover was around for so long -- he served as FBI director for nearly 50 years -- that he was something of a law-enforcement Forrest Gump, present for some of the biggest crimes of the 20th century, and quick to take advantage of them to further his professional and personal interests.

The average age of the state's population, as in the nation, is rising, partly driven by the aging of the huge baby boom generation, whose oldest members were born in 1946 and are of retirement age.

NFC EAST: Yesterday’s column was devoted fully to the Eagles, so I won’t rehash only to say once again second-round pick Vinny Curry, the defensive end from Marshall by way of Neptune High School, was a real good pick. When the Giants sat at No. 32, they had three players in mind: Virginia Tech running back David Wilson, who they selected; LSU wide receiver Reuben Randle and UConn defensive lineman Kendall Reyes. So when they got to 64 and Randle was still on the board, it was a no-brainer for GM Jerry Reese and his crew. For once, Dallas owner Jerry Jones didn’t let his ego get in the way and mess up the team’s draft. The Cowboys actually made a good, calculated move up in the first round and got the guy, LSU cornerback Morris Claiborne, who might be the safest pick in the draft. By that, I mean at worst Claiborne will be a solid cover corner; at best he becomes an All-Pro. Washington might have become the biggest joke in the league. With all kinds of needs on a team that finished in last place in the division for the third time in four years, the Redskins took two quarterbacks with their first three picks.

Château de Beaucastel produces a stupendous Châteauneuf-du-Pape blanc, and its Paso Robles property, Tablas Creek Vineyard, turns out a white in a similar spirit called "Esprit de Beaucastel Blanc." It's no mistake that so many Central Coast winemakers have gravitated toward Rhone varietals. This blend of primarily Roussanne with Grenache Blanc and a little of the livelier Picpoul Blanc is a great tribute to the Rhone with its scent of white peaches and honey, bracing minerality and lush texture. The 2009 changes in the glass, revealing more layers, more complexity.

Coming off a miserable opening week to the season (.174 without an RBI in the first 23 at bats), A-Rod barely drew a cheer from the home crowd during player introductions.

Among those who voted "no" on the 1989 tax-raising conference report was future House Speaker William Batchelder, a Medina conservative in what was then an embattled House Republican minority. Batchelder said that because neither the House nor the Senate had proposed the gas tax increase, slipping it into a conference report was unconstitutional and illegal. Batchelder was right. But Joe and Joan Taxpayer didn't then, and don't now, have top-dollar Columbus lawyers on retainer to challenge such antics. And the highway lobby wasn't about to.
Asked about her career now, the 46-year-old model paused. "I'm active," she said in a calm, careful voice. "I would like to work."
Around the corner on Via Medina, I stopped at a doorway big enough to admit the Trojan horse.

Yauch, who was 47, achieved fame with the Beastie Boys, but as their fame grew he directed his energy toward his lifelong passion: Buddhism and Tibetan independence. While he and his fellow Beastie Boys Mike Diamond (Mike D) and Adam Horovitz (Ad-Rock) continued to transform rap music through classics like "Paul's Boutique," "Check Your Head" and "Ill Communication," Yauch helped tether the group with his rhymes about peace, enlightenment and other topics far removed from the party-rap of the Beastie Boys' early music.

"If dual office holding is a problem, I become the poster child for this," said Singer.

But the question lingers: If a book reviewer brings up a firearm in the first paragraph of his review, does he have to tell whether it is used by the end? Don't look for any spoilers here. Instead, read "The Humbling." Axler may have lost his magic. You can't say the same for Roth.

Looking back to Red McCombs' purchase of the Vikings in 1998, had the group of 10 local stockholders who owned the team at the time kept their word and allowed Glen Taylor to match the price of any other buyer, the threat of the team moving would not be the concern it is today.

Today, however, many Americans are personally uncomfortable with Islam. One kind of discomfort is actual Islamophobia — and it is usually easy to spot. There are many more voices that decry obvious anti-Muslim statements and actions than support them. The second kind is more subtle but still hurtful.

Hey, Tony: I like Colt McCoy, but he simply can't win in this division. Maybe he would have fared better if he was in the NFC West or AFC West, but his problem is that he simply does not elevate the play of the guys around him. Look at Big Ben -- worst O-line in the league and he gets the job done at a Pro Bowl level. If McCoy played with the Steelers' O-line he'd be slaughtered. If the Colts want to trade, we have the most ammo to move up. Two firsts this year and one next year should get it done. If Andrew Luck really is the guy then we got to get him. Any thoughts? -- Billy D, Mentor

A dilapidated English country house, called Sterne, is the setting for this dark but droll story of strangers seeking refuge after a nearby train accident and refusing to leave. The eccentric family living at Sterne, who are celebrating a birthday, initially welcome and comfort the pale wanderers, but soon find themselves overwhelmed by their demands. No further description of the plot is possible without ruining much of the thrill of the story. I'll only say that I read "The Uninvited Guests" a couple of months ago, and I'm still haunted by it. Ms. Jones's earlier work, "The Outcast," won the Costa Book Awards prize for First Novel.
Divorced and childless, Minco often took his widowed mother to stores and racetracks. He reached the finals one year in the World Series of Horse Handicapping in Harrisburg, Pa.

He has indicated since the first day he stepped into our building last training camp that he wanted to be a Raven for the long haul."

Realistically, Barack Obama has about six months to turn around the nation's financial plight or prepare for the possibility of looking for another job at 51. Sadder for him will be the comparisons in history he would have to suffer the rest of his life if that occurs, Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter prominent among them. Hoover had no answer to the financial tidal wave that hit the nation. Carter was a victim of his own inexperience and narrow perspectives about the job.

Michigan State guard Brandon Wood never imagined he'd be engaged in conversations like these as he casually watched college basketball games with his roommate. After all, he'd been an offensive-minded player since he learned to dribble. At Valparaiso, where he'd led the team in scoring and had been an All-Horizon League first-teamer a year ago, his mantra was to shoot -- and then shoot some more.
Jacob Josefson, sidelined with a fractured left wrist, was examined and had a shorter cast put on his left arm.
Last month, Green told the Post-Dispatch she would consider delaying the bond issues until 2014 and issue the bonds in stages, maybe $5 million at a time, instead of all at once.

This restaurant and cocktail bar is awash in feminine touches, from the flattering pink lighting to the sheer quantity of bathroom stalls and mirrors everywhere that make checking makeup remarkably easy. And the cocktail menu is similarly female focused, filled with light, sparkling flavors. A favorite is the Wild Hibiscus, $10, with Acai Absolut vodka, Mumm Brut Prestige and hibiscus syrup.
There's also a rooftop deck complete with a garden where McDowell-Ray said the students will be able to plant crops and receive science lessons.

The rate of displacement surprised even people with a front-row view.
It lends more emotional power to the Hulk when he's eventually unleashed. And through motion-capture technology in which Ruffalo's body language and performance is digitally captured as the undercarriage for the Hulk, topped off by computer animation, the green giant looks more genuine and moves more credibly among real people than he did in the earlier movies.
The Finnish startup making "Angry Birds" games -- in which players use a slingshot to attack pigs who steal the birds' eggs -- has been valued by analysts at up to $9 billion, just short of that of struggling world No. 2 phonemaker Nokia.

If an earlier vote is an indication, residents such as Meeks are open to paying an extra penny in sales tax — part of the 2012 transportation referendum — if it will mean smoother commutes not just on the highway but on the state roads that carry local motorists.
Also tonight, the board will consider a plan to repurpose the district's 44 vacant buildings, many of which have fallen into disrepair. Adams will propose opening a charter high school in one of the district's unused buildings for the 2012-13 school year.
In "Out to Pasture/The Family Farm," another harvesting machine rides above a city scene of skyscrapers in shadowy blue tones. Again the color in the painting nearly overwhelms the image, but you sense narrative and symbolic aspects to the work. Is the family farm threatened by the city? Does the city in some way support the farm? The possibilities are intriguing.
But the bioscience field, which offers the promise of high-paying jobs, got its biggest boost in 2000 when voters passed Proposition 301, a sales-tax increase that would provide about $1 billion over two decades for scientific research at public universities.
Gen. John Allen, top commander of U.S. and all international forces in Afghanistan, issued a statement Wednesday condemning the photos even before they were published.

Hunched over in the tail of the chopper, Arias watches solemnly as Downham unzips Tim’s survival suit, then takes out his knife and cuts the suit at the waist to expose more of his chest. When he does, seawater gushes out. Downham flinches, worried all the saltwater might short-out the helicopter’s electronics. After slicing through Tim’s wet undershirt, and applying several conduction pads to Tim’s chest, Downham tries to shock the fisherman back to life, twice.
"I don't worry about their hurt feelings. Sometimes, that's a good thing. Kids rebound a whole lot better than coaches," Samuel said on the weekly OVC teleconference.

If Zimmerman was the aggressor and provoked the fight, that might be manslaughter, said Orlando defense attorney Diana Tennis.
For Pitt, the big sci-fi thriller also represents his strongest bid to have a big film franchise of his own, which might be viewed as the missing piece of his career jigsaw puzzle. Forster and Paramount Pictures each view "World War Z" as a trilogy that would have the grounded, gun-metal realism of, say, Damon's Jason Bourne series tethered to the unsettling end-times vibe of AMC's "The Walking Dead."
She asks for explanations. How could two branches of evolution independently produce essentially the same complex design for an eye.

Del. Heather R. Mizeur, a Montgomery County Democrat, said she's prepared to introduce legislation to address the concerns of landowners and real estate agents. "There's no reason why Wall Street investors should have more information about the riskiness of this practice in order to protect their financial investment in the company," Mizeur said. "Why should that outweigh the impacts on landowners who are engaging in these leasing practices?"
The spill occurred in 2009 when a tank on the ship Dubai Star began overflowing during refueling between San Francisco and Alameda. Investigators say among other errors, the crew waited hours before calling cleanup companies.
Walker's spokesman, Tom Evenson, said the primary's outcome "changes nothing."
Check the origins. By no means will this guarantee great Champagne, but you can find cells of greatness in many grand cru villages (Champagne is ranked by the price of grapes each village can potentially command). Towns like Ambonnay, Ay and Bouzy (for Pinot Noir) or Cramant, Le-Mesnil-sur-Oger and Avize (for Chardonnay) have a preponderance of great vineyard sites, harnessed by local producers. So check the address.
A strong argument can be made that healthier children are more ready to learn. Healthy children also have fewer school absences, are more engaged in their studies and quite possibly will behave better. Now, what educator would work against that outcome?
Although Albert Pujols was hitless in four at-bats, he drove in a run with a third-inning grounder, ending at 14 a string of games without a run batted in and giving him five RBIs this season.

As Coughlin suggested, there’s yet to be a team on its way to the Super Bowl that isn’t talking about “harmony” among the ranks.
Kapilow writes for the orchestra with undeniable flair, and there are passages in "Chrysopylae" that boast a certain rhythmic exuberance - particularly in the finale, when the chorus bursts into a celebratory passage around the phrase "seventy-five years." And the inclusion of the recorded sounds, which could so easily sound gimmicky, is smoothly integrated into the score.
"The Fighter" was nominated for seven Oscars including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor and Best Supporting Actress (for both Adams and Leo). In January, Bale won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

In the end, the Raiders got two players who take their football very seriously and have good track records at a fraction of a cost that would have taken to retain Wimbley, who nonetheless got $6 million of Oakland's money and was due for another $17.5 million guaranteed had he remained on the roster.

The findings of the two surveys used different methodology and definitions -- and did not necessarily include all of the same veterans. The veterans group surveyed only veterans. The government survey, which is based on annual averages, included all Americans in the work force.
Wait, here’s an idea: Put it all on one foul shot, make or miss. If you hit the free throw, you get to do whatever your heart desires — even fire coach Stan Van Gundy, and hire Shamu from Seaworld.
High rainfall combined with high tide are the main reasons for the water level, which is highest between mileposts 23 and 25.
Carniceria Guanajuato's authenticity is clear. The voice on the PA system speaks Spanish, and aisles are stocked with plenty of unfamiliar -- at least to me -- produce and products. Even the meat counter displays cuts, such as tripe, tongue and pig's trotters, that I don't usually see at my regular store.

Dawn Phipps, a 58-year-old mother of three from Boise, says she's outraged Winder's initiative is happening in Idaho, calling it demeaning and shameful to women.
* A quick note on my philosophy of voting, which I've been explaining for a few years now. I try to vote almost entirely on onfield performance, ignoring my preseason poll and the reputations of the teams. It's pretty simple. Let what happens on the field dictate my rankings. This can make my rankings very volatile from week to week, especially early in the year. In the end, I think this is what most voters end up doing anyway, but for the first month, my ballot can look odd at times.

Kipnis hit a 1-0 pitch from Hisanori Takahashi between first and second base to give the Indians their 11th home win in their last at-bat and break a four-game losing streak.
After several rounds of balloting, it is Piccoli's Cardinal Melville, so unassuming a figure that we hardly notice him in the early processions, who gets the nod. He will be the "incarnation of God on Earth."
In late 2008, French Senator Jean-Pierre Fourcade used a closed-door gathering of center-right lawmakers around Mr. Sarkozy to voice concerns that France's budget deficit and debt risked spiraling out of control.

Caldwell said that after the Japanese earthquake and tsunami last week, Curry County's reverse 9-1-1 system -- which authorities wanted to use to warn residents to stay away from the ocean -- failed because of a glitch. He said Curry County has not been able to put as much of its own local money into 9-1-1 as most other counties in the state.
How much of Aqua's substantial appeal, if any, has to do with Gang's gender? Certainly its shape is animated by characteristics that -- at the risk of slipping into stereotype -- we associate with femininity and even the female form. But then so does Gehry's Beekman Tower, which appears loosely draped in a fabric-like skin. Perhaps more to the point, Aqua seems impatient with the rigidly geometric and overly muscled shapes that surround it in the Chicago skyline as well as with the race to achieve height at the expense of architectural expression.
"These are the memories we use to develop a sense of identity -- who we are and where we come from," said study author Carole Peterson, a professor of psychology at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada.

Orville and Wilbur Wright didn't have a government grant to launch their plane, and, more importantly, they didn't need three dozen permits and an EPA study to take off. They took their risk, not just in terms of dreams and accomplishment, but of treasure and bodily harm, and quite literally took off — without a safety net! But we latter-day Americans demand a safety net. If not on our own, then there is always some busybody willing to put a safety net around a rare, never-heard-of bottom-feeder fish or somebody else's dubious economic interests. The trouble is, safety does not breed invention.

5. Castle Lake, Trinity-Divide: This adventure has world-class views and is easy to reach off I-5, but gets missed by thousands. Castle Lake Road is directly west of Mount Shasta and rises up from Lake Siskiyou into the Trinity-Divide. The road has been plowed this week to Castle Lake, but by mid-winter, it is usually blocked by snow about a mile from the lake. This is one of the best viewpoints to the east, where giant Shasta pokes a hole into the sky like a giant diamond. You can snowshoe about a mile with a slight, easy grade to Castle Lake, elevation 5,450 feet.

One chapter in particular resonates with Fickell. Dedicated to "The Man of Action," it is based on Union Lt. Col. Joshua Chamberlain's defense of a hill called Little Round Top in the Battle of Gettysburg. In the decisive action of the pivotal battle of the Civil War, Chamberlain, a former Maine schoolteacher, led a bayonet charge down the hill, repulsing a Confederate advance and keeping the Union forces from being flanked. "Many people move out of the way for a person on the run," Andrews argues. "Others are caught up in his wake."

And unlike many rich people who dabble in Hollywood, Soon-Shiong has no opinion on the content Fourth Wall makes. "I have very little knowledge of media, so I don't know whether what they are making is good or bad," he said with a laugh.

The Sterling Vintner's Collection Chardonnay is a medium-bodied, bigger white than the pinot grigio. It's also more complex, partially due to oak aging, which lends vanilla flavoring to the wine. It's a well-balanced wine, meaning that peach and stone fruit flavors are not overwhelmed by the oak. Although I preferred the pinot grigio with my fish dinner, another diner, who got drafted into our tasting, thought the chardonnay was a better match.

"The Walking Dead": Fans of the zombie apocalypse-and-the-people-who-survived-it series have been divided about Season 2. After AMC fired showrunner Frank Darabont early in the filming of Season 2, viewers were outraged. The show's budget was reduced, and some fans have griped about too much being spent on one location, a farm that serves as temporary refuge for the hard-pressed survivors.
