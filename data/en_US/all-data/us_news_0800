Meanwhile, the city needs to make it easier for immigrants who bring their entrepreneurial skills to this country to open businesses. Navigating the red tape can be frustrating for any would-be business owner, but it could be particularly baffling for a newcomer to this country. Small businesses serve as engines of economic development in immigrant communities, and they also provide an anchor that encourages people to come and settle.

The catchphrase in the Blazers locker room was that everyone is "thinking too much," but nobody could pinpoint what they are over-thinking.

Congress can easily turn the trend around with “carbon fee and dividend” legislation, which places a gradually rising fee on carbon as it enters the economy and rebates the proceeds in monthly “green” checks to American households. Consumers are shielded from price shocks even while the costs of coal, oil and gas gradually rise.

The teachers union has been offered a chance to help make the draft legislation better, and it should do so.

My mind was awash with Wes Craven-fueled images as I ran around the couch to see exactly what he was doing. Had he turned the cat inside out? Had he suddenly figured out how to use the front door and was now out playing in traffic? Had he fallen into an interdimensional gate and now I would have to search the universe for him (that is exactly the kind of thing he would do)? No, he had discovered his toes. He was sitting on the floor, playing with toes. Apparently his toes can hear very well and don't need to be screamed at. I, on the the other hand, am completely deaf since he looked up at me, saw the bowl of apple slices and happily screamed his head off.

Back in the 1950s, that stretch of McDowell Road near 17th Street was a bustling business district known as Miracle Mile. Needless to say, those days are past. The 85-foot steel arch was installed in 1991 by as a joint project of the East McDowell Civic Association and the Phoenix Arts Commission in hopes of revitalizing the area as sort of a gateway to the city. It was designed by artist Michelle Stuhl, who described it as an abstract white picket fence. The $47,500 arch was meant to symbolize "reliving the miracle," said Charles Civer, Civic Association president at the time the arch was put in.

On the mound. Nicasio threw a career-high 115 pitches, eclipsing the 111 he fired last July 1 against Kansas City at Coors Field. The reasons were two-fold: he was performing well and the Rockies desperately need the rotation to start gobbling innings. Nicasio allowed just two runs on nine hits. He has reached six innings in four of his five starts, joining Jamie Moyer as the rotation's most reliable member. He allowed the team to rest Josh Roenicke and Matt Belisle, both of whom have assumed a heavy work load this season. The right-hander also benefited from solid defense from Todd Helton.

So why is Germany booming now? The country is reaping what it sowed during a sometimes-painful restructuring to overcome the aforementioned chronic unemployment. One spur was the opening of Eastern Europe to German investment, which gave firms a low-cost production alternative analogous to the U.S. South. The threat of runaway shops weakened German unions in collective bargaining and politics, opening the way for more modest wage gains and a series of labor market reforms, enacted under a Social Democratic government -- over bitter union opposition.

As so amusingly played by Cumberbatch, who has imbued his character with a singeing intelligence and an offbeat sexual allure, Sherlock is a constant source of insulting ill-timed truths, a showoff who just can't help himself.

And Romney was still silent a day later, when the Rev. Franklin Graham, Billy Graham's son, said on MSNBC that while he believed Santorum was a Christian, he couldn't be sure whether Obama or Romney was. Maybe Graham was channeling the Southern Baptist pastor Robert Jeffress, who said in October that the Mormon Church was a cult. Last week, Jeffress said he would hold his nose and vote for Romney. No doubt his antipathy is shared by the one-third of evangelical Christians who told the Pew Research Center that they would have a hard time voting for a Mormon.

There are many ways to cook this popular cut of beef, but low-heat roasting minimizes shrinkage and helps you avoid the wide ring of well-done meat around the roast's beautiful rosy pink interior.

He lamented the turn the art world took in the 1960s, when, he argued, critics and scholars threw aesthetics out the window in favor of judging artworks through a political lens. He believed the criteria for judging art was not subject to intellectual fads, the category to which he relegated works about cultural diversity and feminism. He once belittled the naming of Los Angeles' Temporary Contemporary (now the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA), which he said was sad evidence of how ephemeral cultural standards had become.

But the Jets weren’t ready. Last January, the Jets seemed to come up with the game plan for slowing Brady, loading up the field with enough defensive backs to clog his throwing lanes.

Across the country, we've seen over 100 men walk off death row because eyewitnesses lied or were mistaken, because the DNA didn't match, because police, prosecutors or lab techs made mistakes or mishandled evidence. ... Unfortunately, we can't find and fix every flaw in the justice system. Pfeifer is right. We need to do what Illinois did. Its House and Senate just passed a bill to abolish the death penalty. Ohio should do the same.Last year, 10 Catholic church leaders in Ohio signed a statement urging the state to stop using capital punishment. The former director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction wrote a column last year in opposition of its use. Former Ohio Attorney General Jim Petro also is raising questions about capital punishment, but he stops short of calling for a repeal:

Santorum stumped in an open-collared shirt, a dark suit and black cowboy boots. He seems to have misplaced his sweater vests, which were his lucky talismans.

King expressed optimism that society was changing but offered a mixed message about the Martin case. "Unfortunately, it's a rough road. It's tough being a young black man," he said. "As far as racist profiling just because you're black, we've got to move past that." And yet he added: "It's in our blood, in the world's blood, because we're all sinners."
The screenplay, set in the 19th century, alluded to Agnes being an artist, though that’s not really in the film.

Video: From the NBC telecast, most of the Browns' game-winning drive in the second overtime, ending with Mark Moseley's 27-yard field goal:
Incumbents from states with closed primaries have reason to be sensitive to inter-party challenges if they stray from the base ideology. These days, it is the only political threat that seems to resonate with some. One of the major stories of the 2010 elections was successful internal party challenges to Republican moderates by conservatives: Utah Sen. Bob Bennett was bested by Mike Lee in the GOP primary in May 2010. Christine O'Donnell's primary win over Rep. Mike Castle almost certainly resulted in Democrat Chris Coons winning the Delaware Senate seat. Republican and Democratic moderates who used to align in cross-party coalitions often feel constrained by primary threats. The resulting ideological radicalization of Congress and strict "party voting" results in more than increased confrontation and less consensus: We have a Congress of ideologues representing a country of pragmatists who increasingly feel alienated by partisan rancor. Indeed, a Gallup Poll found that on the debt-ceiling debate, 82 percent of Americans thought members of Congress were guided by partisan advantage while only 14 percent thought they were acting out of what was good for the country.

According to the FTC, a typical scenario was to charge consumers a $90 finance fee on a $300 loan.

Under that system, which was not disclosed to borrowers, total payments on a $300 loan hit $975.

The sheer scope of the ad effort — $25 million in one month in the battlegrounds of Virginia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nevada, New Hampshire, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida and Colorado — illustrates the huge advantage the incumbent Democrat has over Romney. Obama is tapping into a campaign bank account of more than $100 million to pay for his big opening salvo in the TV ad wars while Romney scurries to catch up after a costly and contentious primary season. The presumptive GOP nominee is relying on outside groups — like the pro-Romney Restore Our Future political action committee — to keep him competitive on the air against Obama’s behemoth campaign.

These days he writes for Golf Digest, but even during his 22-year career at Sports Illustrated, and before that at the now-defunct Fort Worth Press, his comic style came straight off the Fort Worth municipal golf courses where he played as a kid. In Jenkins's 11 novels, including "Semi-Tough," on pro football, and "Dead Solid Perfect," on golf, his wisecracking central characters almost all hail from Fort Worth and attended Paschal High School, just like him and Hogan and, for that matter, me.

Her blonde hair curled into a Marilyn Monroe flow, her old-fashioned style vocals flying high, Day gave a fantastic performance of a song that has become a favorite of late on reality singing shows. The crowd loved it - for good reason - with a "HAL-LIE" chant even erupting at the finish. Day is definitely worth keeping an eye on going forward. Sidenote: Hallie Day is an awesome name.
HUDA'S GONE - Jasmine Huda, a popular reporter at KSDK-TV (Channel 5), is leaving the station as of today, news director Mike Shipley said Friday. "We loved her to death. She's a great young talent," Shipley said. "I can't go into any of the details, but we have only the best things to say about her." Sources at the station said an e-mail was sent around by management earlier Friday saying they regretted they were unable to reach agreement on a new contract with Huda. Shipley said he couldn't say what Huda is planning to do when she leaves KSDK. Huda did not return a call for comment. Huda, 31, is a St. Louis native who was hired away from a Springfield, Mo., station in 2007 after Karen Foss announced that she was leaving the station to go to work for AmerenUE. Station insiders say it was widely believed that management was grooming Huda to replace Foss. After Foss left the station, Deanne Lane anchored the news until April when she left, also after failing to reach a contract agreement.
Gov. Jerry Brown and the California High-Speed Rail Authority propose to use $2.6 billion in high-speed rail bond funds and $3.3 billion in federal funds to start construction in the Central Valley by early next year. The LAO and other critics of the project have long questioned the authority's reliance on uncertain federal funding to complete the project, an objection raised by the LAO again.

"There's a lot of buzz about 4K right now," Soohoo said. "But the resolution is impressive, like what you see in a movie theater."
But that’s the nature of chasing perfection. It’s not only unattainable, it makes a performance that’s merely very good seem downright awful. Brady didn’t have his best day against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship Game. But is there another quarterback who would declare that he “sucked” while his teammates started slipping on their championship caps?
To the film’s credit, too, it’s open to the awkward, honest — and not always flattering — moments of real life. Tom and Violet love each other. But that doesn’t mean they can’t be awful to each other or react badly when called on it. They’re a committed couple, yes, but the worst wounds always come in close combat.

Former federal railroad inspector Paul Gouty, an expert for the Manns, testified that it would have been "highly unlikely" for either Mann or Sherrill to spot the signal in the fog. Not only was the light out, but the signal pole was warped and faced away from the track, Gouty said.
Christie added he will work to make affordable housing policy "fair and effective" going forward.
We all have different needs when it comes to banking services. Fortunately, we have many more options now than we did even a few years ago, thanks to such innovations as online banking. True, many regional and national banks have been absorbed by larger banks, but those banks now provide a wider array of services than before, albeit typically with higher fees.

The high-end street-food trend has gained momentum in the past couple of years, evolving most notably in Los Angeles' taco truck culture and spreading to cities throughout the country. With roots in the humble lunch truck, these new incarnations are helmed by Michelin three-star chefs and serve everything from grass-fed beef burgers to French pastries to gelato.
Earlier this week, the Heartland Institute, a self-described “free-market think tank” that pilloried climate scientists whose stolen emails were released in 2009 as part of the so-called Climategate flap, found itself duped out of several confidential fundraising documents that were then distributed widely over the Internet, offering a glimpse of its priorities.
M. Albert Figinski, an attorney representing Angelos' group, said Thursday that the city pressured Little to act on his own in favor of a plan to "destroy rather than preserve." Only the board had the right to act on the plan, and the court should allow board members to do so, the suit contends.

For my tasting, I shopped at Dierbergs at Brentwood Pointe, where I bought the 2009 Chateau Ste. Michelle Indian Wells Cabernet Sauvignon ($12.98) and the 2009 Hogue Cabernet Sauvignon ($10.79). Both wines come from the Columbia Valley, Washington's largest American Viticultural Area, which covers almost 11 million acres, nearly a third of the state.
Becky Bloomwood is a sparkly young woman breezing about Manhattan. She's happiest when she's buzzing into stores to score a dress, a coat, a bag. For her it's like an addictive aphrodisiac, the smell of leather, the swipe of a credit card. "When I shop," she says, "the world gets better."
The competition is obviously and understandably vital to two hungry and fast-rising contenders, so the game went on. And a sellout crowd put their worries aside to watch the first act of what should be a dramatic series.

While raising money from groups outside one's home state is nothing new, Kerrey's recent take - which includes $1,000 from Barbra Streisand and $5,000 from S.

The hope of many Democrats is that Smith can be talked into resigning from his seat in the House and giving up the nomination, moves that would allow Democratic ward bosses to pick a successor and a candidate for the November general election.
The hospital grew through the years. And in keeping with its Catholic identity and the charisma of the Sisters, the care of "private charity patients" represented a sizable percentage of the hospital's work. In fact, in 1881, both the city of Baltimore and state of Maryland designated St. Joseph's to care for "indigent patients."

Like any other museum on the distant road, it is nice to make connections with home. The wooden Walker Vehicle Co. truck with a steel floor was used by Bowman Dairy to transport "Milk of Superior Flavor," according to a panel on the side of the truck. "I don't know how you take that because it was unrefrigerated," Meier said. "Does it get flavor as you drive around? It had a range of about 50 miles and ran about 12, 15 miles an hour. There's no speedometer in it. You've got parking brake and a foot brake."

Another politician might get away with routine tardiness and absences, but Adams is already fighting to regain the public's trust after a rocky two years. He acknowledged lying about a sexual relationship with a teenager, then faced a criminal investigation and two recall attempts. After the recall threat ended in April, Adams defaulted on a mortgage for the third time in 14 months and got in a public spat with Cogen last month over the mayor's promise to contribute city money to the Sellwood Bridge.
Season recap: Waltmire wasn't at his best at the beginning of the season and when he was on his game, the events he participated in usually were rained out. He changed his swing right before the season started, so that took some time to incorporate. But Waltmire certainly shined at the Division II state tournament. He was one stroke off the leader's pace on the 18th hole, but he birdied to force a three-hole playoff. There Waltmire pulled away to snag the individual title. His performance also helped Canyon del Oro to win the team championship.
Hendricks scored midway through the first period, and Seguin tied it in the second. It stayed that way through a scoreless third, with Washington killing off a penalty in the final three minutes to send the game into overtime.

Service changes mean you’re staying in your destination longer than expected. So you’re going to Buenos Aires. Congratulations! Except that between the time you booked and the time you travel, your airline decreases service to the destination from daily to five times weekly. This means that your return flight has been canceled. Now you’re spending extra, unplanned nights. Do you have a right to ask the airline to compensate you? Unfortunately, no. And most travel insurance policies won’t cover you, either. At best, you’ll be offered a refund and told to book a last-minute flight on another airline at considerably higher cost. This is one of the most pressing areas for new airline regulation.

Boring wouldn't be the first to pull out of TriMet. Since 1989, Wilsonville, Damascus, Molalla, Canby and Sandy have done so. Aside from Damascus, all those cities developed their own transit systems to make up for the lack in service. Canby, for example, offers a free paratransit service to its residents along with a regular bus service. Recently, Canby made major cuts to the service after its budget was slashed.
Into this on-screen love-in is dropped the depth charge of Rachel's fresh-from-rehab sister, Kym (Hathaway), forcing to the surface rich veins of familial resentment.

Re "A more palatable tax reform," Opinion, April 20
Lugar supported the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty with Russia that Obama signed last year, and he voted in favor of Supreme Court nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. His reputation as a centrist made him an easy target for Tea Party-aligned groups, who rallied around Mourdock.

For instance, according to the Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development, "During the second half of the 20th century, human numbers and food demand grew at an unprecedented pace, yet food supplies increased even faster." Around the world, "prices of corn, rice and other staple grains were 75 percent lower in the middle 1980s than in 1950," proving that they had become more abundant. Real prices have stayed low for decades. Such improvements came as the result of advances in farming and high crop yields, which came from human beings living in free economies.

“Based on favorable utility costs so far this fiscal year, it's likely that more than $200,000 of utility savings could be transferred from that budget to the school bus replacement account,” said Scott Johnson, the district's chief financial officer. “These savings could help fund additional purchase beyond the three that are currently budgeted.”

(But Bechard assures it won't be the same food you'll get elsewhere: "Somebody who has the chili here, and chili at Shari's, they're going to know the difference.")

Can relations be mended? Can the United States still leave Afghanistan on its own terms? Can the two countries salvage a long-range strategic partnership that extends past the military withdrawal? It's hard to say. Two days before the atrocity, we were heartened by the fact that the two countries had managed to overcome a measure of mutual suspicion and advance the day when Afghanistan takes full responsibility for its own security.
