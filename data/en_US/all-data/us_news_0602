At that point, Bielema was operating with what he should have thought was one of the best teams, and certainly one of the best offenses, in the nation. Getting quarterback Russell Wilson the ball with any time on the clock would have been worth it. The Badgers were too good to play scared and settle for overtime. "We were going for the win," Bielema said afterward, and really, that's all that needed to be said. ...
"You can take away just about everything from individuals ... in terms of material livelihood," Hart-Andersen said.

Bandooch beams and nods. Later he says to me, "So I'm getting her a piano. Something like the one Schroeder plays in 'Peanuts' would be about the right size, don't you think?"

In between, Spurlock weaves fond remembrances from more famous names: comic legends like Stan Lee and Frank Miller, revered writer-directors like Joss Whedon and Kevin Smith, and popular actors including Seth Rogen and Olivia Wilde.

Alec Baldwin, who made headlines this month for getting kicked off a flight after tussling with a flight attendant, has decided he no longer aspires to become the next mayor of New York City.
Four years later, it is difficult to find this Palin in her public utterances. Her suspicion of the media has become antipathy. Her style is often abrasive and self-pitying. She encourages an odd sort of conservative class resentment, attacking George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush as "blue bloods." Her hyperpartisanship can be embarrassing. Michelle Obama's concern about child obesity, in her view, violates our "God-given rights to make our own decisions" -- a Jeffersonian defense of Twinkies in high-school vending machines.

Cleare and Mitchell, both four-star post players, provide a formidable inside duo. Layman, a shooter with length, has plenty of upside.

Some of the 82 Kansas stores that closed have reopened as community co-ops. The residents of tiny Leeton, Mo., set up a school-sponsored enterprise in which students manage a grocery store  ordering, stocking and pricing items, working the counter and sweeping the floors.

Expect to see more similar moves industry-wide, although in most cases they will be more about generating new revenue than about passenger convenience.
Each judgeship is its own political "office" for purposes of the election. That means candidates run for a specific judgeship. Even though they run at-large within the county, it's nota situation, like on a city council, in which multiple candidates run for three open seats and the top three vote-getters win jobs. So there's always jockeying around among prospective judicial candidates - most of whom are usually deputy district attorneys - as to which "office" to run for. You don't want to pit yourself against a good friend or someone with a better resume or more political support.
Mogahed, who claims she was instrumental in the composition of President Obama's infamous Cairo speech to the Muslim world, was on a controversial television show in London awhile back. The UK Telegraph reported that this White House advisor remained silent as others bantered about the West's "secular man-made law" (the Constitution) and talked about the "lethal cocktail of liberty and capitalism." Mogahed told the show's host the West's view of Sharia, is "oversimplified," and "not well understood." It would be nice to hear the poor Moroccan woman's take on that one.
With Mitt Romney not scheduled into Illinois until March 19 (though he could well add stops) Romney's Illinois team also has a Wednesday fly-around aimed at the four major Illinois television markets with Rutherford and former House Speaker J.

The bank is reducing its exposure to residential development loans. Umpqua closed the quarter with $501 million in loans to residential developers, down $81 million from last quarter and down $263 million from September 30, 2007. Nonperforming loans, while still on the increase, seem manageable.
The world premiere of "Sense & Sensibility The Musical" is a coup, a stretch and and a fitting expression of the ongoing ambitions of the Denver Center's resident theater company. Not only does the musical take on the work of the maverick female writer, director Marcia Milgrom Dodge is set to direct. The increasingly acclaimed director-choreographer helmed a read through of the play at New York's Playwrights Horizons. She gained a permanent spot on the radar with her 2009 revival of "Ragtime" at Washington's Kennedy Center.

Obama's speech last week suggested that he sees the wealthy almost as a parasite class. Over and over, he demanded that these plutocrats pay their fair share or do their part, as if he had no idea that the top 10 percent of earners already shoulder 70 percent of the income tax load or that nearly half of American households pay no income tax at all.

His disclosure in a Vanity Fair article by his family's lawyer, John D. O'Connor, provoked a national debate: Was he a hero who should be lauded for sparing the country the strain of further high crimes and misdemeanors by the Nixon White House?

Cris Collinsworth, the analyst on the NFL Network broadcast of that game, said Manning looked in that game as though he were just "playing football," as opposed to times in the past where the quarterback who was Archie Manning's son and Peyton Manning's brother too often seemed, Collinsworth thought, to be simply executing plays in robotic fashion.
The final narrow rays of sunlight gave way to dark and stormy around 8 p.m., just as Kid Cudi hit the stage. His was easily the most interactive act of the night, and what started off slowly with hits like “Soundtrack 2 My Life” and “Mojo So Dope,” soon gave way to blunt-raising and head-bumping tracks including “Up Up and Away” and the David Guetta-collaboration “Memories.” His biggest hit, “Day n’ Nite,” was only given a slight nod at the end of “Erase Me,” which I’m sure the crowds of high schoolers were disappointed about. Nonetheless, Kid Cudi nearly stole the show from the headliner and the final act of the night.

Surely it's where we're headed. Oregon's imminent debut of The ORcade will set us on that path, however lightly. That's why the lottery commission should reconsider its green light for The ORcade, and so should Gov. John Kitzhaber, who gave it a nod when briefed. Legislators who track Oregon's revenue also should speak up.

According to some archaeologists, two cable TV reality shows have done just that. National Geographic's "Diggers" and Spike TV's "American Digger" follow the exploits of the archaeological equivalent of bounty hunters who, with property owners' permission, dig and occasionally blast their way to underground artifacts, which they hope to sell to collectors for profit. The issue here isn't so much the legality of what the diggers are doing, but the ethics.

"We have a process at the university in which we do not immediately make decisions. We try to be deliberate and that was the process. Two months later, I think there were a lot of additional facts, and I think there was also the reality that we were facing serious issues.

The money would come from Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, one of the sponsors, said the thinking is that Medicare already spends billions on chronic care for patients who smoke, gain too much weight, eat too much sugar, or fail to exercise or control their cholesterol. Medicare spends $3.8 billion a year just on annual "wellness exams" for nearly 2.3 million seniors, yet seniors often leave those exams "without a game plan," said Democratic Sen.

A similar measure stalled in Springfield last year, which Berrios blamed on pressure from real estate agents and landlords who oppose the plan.

The lack of enthusiasm from the market is understandable. Huge implementation risks remain. The Greek government has a daunting list of so-called"prior actions" to achieve before it receives the bailout money. There is a non-negligible risk the private sector bondholder debt exchange will fail. National parliaments in Germany, the Netherlands and Finland must approve the deal. Worse, hardly anyone thinks the deal will work: Few believe there is much chance that Greece will hit its target of a debt to GDP ratio of 120.5% by 2020—or that the debt would be sustainable if it did. Most believe further debt relief will be needed, so the prospect of a default and euro exit remains.

But in the year between the program's announcement and the two accountants' retirement on Jan. 14, the auditor did not sufficiently train other workers to fill the spots, said Destin Ramsey, the auditor's chief operating officer.
I've always been amazed by what the Coyotes have done. Dave Tippett is a miracle worker. His team has plowed on through bankruptcy and talent losses to keep winning. But when you look at the talent level and the history of goaltender Mike Smith, you see that team as arguably the least dangerous of the No. 8 seeds. The Desert Dogs have had a tough month with some difficult losses. Can they reverse that in three weeks?

In a broad sense, sure, Crean was right. But Saturday, IU (27-8) doesn't advance out of the third round if not for freshman center Cody Zeller's game-high 16 points and 13 rebounds. Or the inspired play of sophomore guard Victor Oladipo, whose athleticism and attacking style helped make it fair fight against the Rams.
"This was not the fault of a few bankers, a few politicians or even a few central banks," King said. "This was the failure of a system. And I accept our share of responsibility in going along with a system of banking that failed."
Other UCF projects delayed by the governor's veto include renovations of two classroom buildings and improvements to infrastructure, such as chiller plants.
--Wal-Mart fell 4 percent after missing analysts' expectations for revenue and per-share earnings. The world's biggest retailer has lost some of its momentum in the past couple of years with strategic errors like a brief foray away from "everyday low prices," which turned off cash-strapped bargain hunters, and a short attempt to declutter its shelves and offer fewer items, which turned off customers who went there for the convenience.
Christie also said women can go to federal qualified health centers and emergency rooms for these services, Weinberg said. "The centers themselves have said they have some centers that do not provide ob-gyn services,'' Weinberg said. "And who goes to the ER for birth control?"

Once when I was leaving for home after a visit, he stuffed my duffel bag with as many balls as possible. The bag was bursting with an assortment of every golf ball manufactured.

For those familiar with British film history, gritty may instantly equate with working class and realistic. In this case it does and it doesn't. Does because Mia's surroundings fill the bill—a cheerless housing project that she, her prickly mother and kid sister call home; a landscape mostly, though not entirely, distinguished by blank horizons and vestiges of vanished industries. Doesn't because Ms. Arnold relieves the grittiness with interludes of intense pleasure (during one of them, Mia watches her mother's handsome boyfriend catch a fish with his bare hands), and transcends realist conventions with tough-minded poetry. (The spirit of Fellini seems to hover over an exquisite, ritualized dance toward the end.)
It's called the Big One for One Drop. The buy-in is $1 million per player and the game is no-limit Texas hold 'em.

The fight started more than a decade ago in Surf City when oceanfront residents resisted granting easements because they felt they were losing their privacy. They didn’t get very far with that argument; the state successfully argued the oceanfront residents don’t own the beach and that the public has the right to access the sand in front of their homes. A court agreed that the borough has the right to erect dunes on the homeowners’ property because it has a right to prevent a nuisance — the destruction from storms.

Then the judges chat. They agree Mila's collection was good, but not surprising. Michael says Seth Aaron's collection was much more sophisticated than where he had been. But he can still overwork looks. Nina says he can be borderline costume-y. But Michael liked that Seth Aaron knew he was putting on a show. Nina admires Seth Aaron's guts, and that he's "more fearless," than the others. Emilio went more quiet, they say, with a collection that looked like it was ready to be sold, but didn't have the showstopper quality they look for in a runway presentation, which then gets tamed a bit for commercial production. "Where was the drama?" Michael asks. The choice comes down to who is the most creative? Who has the most to say?

We engineers and seismologists need to gather and study as much data as we can from Chile's quake. But one thing is already clear: Based on the kind of damage that buildings suffered in Chile, tall structures in the earthquake zones of the United States appear to be at much higher risk than we thought. This lesson should be of obvious concern to San Francisco and Los Angeles. But it is actually the Pacific Northwest that is most vulnerable to a mega-quake like Chile's.

Fine print: Premiums for comparable private coverage run cheaper by $50 to $100 a month than the federal high-risk plans. And more than 13,700 Oregonians with pre-existing conditions remain stuck paying substantially higher premiums because they enrolled in a state-run insurance pool before the federal program opened. To become eligible for the cheaper, federally subsidized coverage, they would have go uninsured for six months. Enrollment in federal insurance pool has fallen short of expectations across the nation. In Oregon, only 779 residents have signed up.

D.C. has no "ethnic" neighborhoods with the tantalizing food and flavor distinctive to such neighborhoods. There's no Little Italy here, no Collinwood or St. Clair-Superior. D.C. has no white "working class" people who, along with their brown-skinned neighbors, are struggling to survive and infuse cities with a certain raw energy. The only white people in D.C. are privileged people -- students, the wealthy, the politically connected. Cleveland, with its economic and cultural diversity, is a true melting pot. D.C., with its schism between blacks and whites, has the creepy feel of apartheid.

Unlike in Iraq, the insurgency in Afghanistan doesn't spring from deep-seated animosity toward a fatally sectarian government. Rather, as former U.S. special envoy James Dobbins points out, the insurgents are primarily ethnic Pashtun living on both sides of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, and their campaign is organized, armed, funded and directed from Pakistan. The Taliban have been Pakistan's hedge against a united Afghanistan allied with India. This thorny problem won't be easily solved, but it can be managed. Weak governments around the world have successfully dealt with insurgencies -- when they have been able to pressure the rebels' foreign sanctuaries and when they have earned popular support by political inclusion and economic progress.
In Seattle, where the National Guard was deployed during the 1999 World Trade Organization protests, the mayor has publicly supported the Occupy protesters.

In this telling, we humans are like all other animals - deeply and thoroughly selfish. We spend our time trying to maximize our outcomes - competing for status, wealth and mating opportunities. Behavior that seems altruistic is really self-interest in disguise. Charity and fellowship are the cultural drapery atop the iron logic of nature.

The Giants and Cowboys also met in the final game of the 1993 regular season with the NFC East crown on the line. But both teams were 11-4 — not a mediocre 8-7 — and were going to the playoffs regardless of the outcome. Still, there was something to play for: The winner would earn the No. 1 seed and home-field advantage. The loser would be the fourth seed and had to go on the road.

Even so, there is good reason to wonder whether the vendor really has the resources to provide adequate services for all the groups it is targeting.

It is not my intention here to parse any of those troubling quotes. Let us leave it to religious scholars to contextualize them, to explain how they square with the contention that Islam and Christianity are religions of peace.

To get a sense of what was wrong with opt-out, let's rewind to a 2010 column of mine on this subject. In it, I spoke with customers who booked airline tickets online only to discover that a box indicating that they also wanted to buy optional travel insurance had been pre-checked. I interviewed Terri Widder, a retiree from Carol Stream, Ill., who bought American Airlines tickets through a site operated by Travelocity. She nearly ended up with precisely the same insurance that Minnesota took action against: a Travel Guard policy.

"Top of the Rock": Remember when Thursday nights on NBC were a national town hall of quality viewing, not a niche gathering for a much smaller band of comedy geeks? So does former NBC entertainment prez Warren Littlefield. He tells the story of the 1990s must-see TV era in this book (out Tuesday) through the voices of the people who created and starred in defining shows like "Seinfeld," "Friends," "Will & Grace" and more. Did you know that Nancy McKeon of "The Facts of Life" was in the running to play Monica on "Friends"? Or that Lisa Kudrow was originally hired to play Roz on "Frasier"? Littlefield, who had a "Seinfeld" character based on him (the Elaine-obsessed network exec played by Bob Balaban), has provided yet another hit: this essential oral history for couch-potato libraries.

From the moment Larry David appears, in full nun's wimple and habit, as Sister Mary-Mengele (hah!), the Farrelly brothers' updating of the lowbrow comedy trio works. We meet Larry, Curly and Moe the day they're hurled, in a bundle, at the door of an orphanage and watch as they grow into troublesome orphans with bad haircuts. Mother Superior (Jane Lynch) and Sister Rosemary (Jennifer Hudson) tolerate the boys, so when, 35 years after their arrival, the orphanage faces foreclosure, the Stooges decide to save the day. A plan is hatched after they run into a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) who wants them to smother her husband. The Farrellys, who fell off raunchy comedy's cutting edge in recent years, manage the right tone here, and they've scored with their casting. Sean Hayes (of TV's "Will & Grace") is mannered but funny as Larry, while Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos truly inhabit the roles of Curly and Moe. Rated PG; slapstick action violence, rude and suggestive humor. 1 hour, 32 minutes. By Roger Moore.

Either way, the BOE shows little sign of changing its approach despite its new model: Astonishingly, the words "deleverage" or deleveraging" haven't appeared once in the last five Inflation Reports, notes Citigroup. The MPC is still not consulted on crucial decisions regarding the banking system: The decision to force banks to repay early emergency funding provided under the Special Liquidity Scheme—arguably the BOE's most successful policy since the start of the crisis—was taken without reference to the MPC. Policies on bank capital and liquidity ratios are the preserve of the separate Financial Policy Committee. And BOE Governor Mervyn King refuses to allow the MPC a say on whether it should buy private-sector assets as part of its quantitative-easing program or engage in other measures to ease the pressure on bank funding costs.

Hokkaido is far more low-key, from the intensity of the room to the flavors of the food. And since Shoki is not for everyone, Hokkaido should be a viable player in the ramen game.

Although the rappers abhor the term "horrorcore," the Odd Future live experience does share many qualities with a good slasher film. The stage show is chaotic, relentless, yet weirdly watchable; emcees pop up out of nowhere to stab up the track with vicious rhymes, and then disappear back into the shadows. Group leader Tyler, the Creator -- who won Best New Artist at the MTV Video Music Awards calls himself a goblin, and he behaves accordingly, rattling off gruesome verses about unprintable subjects. The kids love him, of course, and recognize him as one of their own: an impish, foul-mouthed, attention-grabbing wiseguy hell-bent on making authority figures howl with outrage. He's the daredevil friend who'll mouth off to grownups when they don't have the guts to; he'll take the trip to the principal's office with a smile. Tyler often gives the impression that if apples were considered offensive, he'd do an entire album about apples.

They tapped the artichoke-based amaro Cynar, rounding it out with gin, lemon juice and another bitter element, Carpano Antica Formula vermouth.

Where has Jack White been all these years? We know the official story — making blues-pop with the Raconteurs, singing Bond themes with Alicia Keys, producing for ex-wife Karen Elson, licensing ferocious mater-ial to crummy ad campaigns. But the White who roasted eardrums with the White Stripes on the “Elephant” album has been curiously MIA; he has been too cheerful, temperate or unfocused to bring the pain with such deranged conviction. On “Blunderbuss,” that White is back, taking berserk inspiration from heartbreak and reclaiming the emotionally raw blues-rock territory he ceded to other artists. He draws inspiration from the same sources he did in his Stripes days: Led Zep, the Doors, the Faces, “The White Album,” classic blues 45s (this set includes a thunderous version of Rudy Toombs’ “I’m Shakin’ ”). He gives the impression that he writes his lyrics in a rush, but he’s a pro at turning out memorable phrases, and has never been more thrillingly acrid than he is here. There’s more piano than Stripes fans might like, but every time he picks up his six-string to solo, he shows why hard, embodied blues will always sound contemporary.

For the federal government, however, hundreds of millions of dollars isn't a lot. There is also a national rationale for spending it. Human and drug smuggling is now largely in the hands of organized and violent Mexican criminal syndicates. Arizona is the main corridor for distribution of both throughout the country. This makes the failure of the federal government to act in a big enough way to make a difference both unwise and insanely frustrating for those living near the border.

Ben Golliver: It's difficult to envision a scenario in which Crawford returns to Portland as he is looking for a multi-year contract, he's at the stage of his career where he fits best on a contender and his 2011-12 season didn't go very well at all. Assuming Elliot Williams gets and then stays healthy, Portland is better off drastically increasing his playing time than paying to watch Crawford ball stop and pop rainbow jumpers. The Portland media will miss his friendly personality and quick quips. But his production simply didn't match his cost. His career-long tour from team-to-team will almost certainly find a new stop this summer.

In Crested Butte, where every view seems to contain a snow-capped peak and ranchers still herd cattle on city streets, the American frontier is alive and well. Perhaps that's how I found myself exploring the rustic Colorado countryside just outside of town on horseback with Mount Crested Butte - a 12,000 foot mass of craggy rock and pine - in the distance. If you're not exploring the snow-covered hillsides and picturesque ranches on horseback this winter, a pair of alpine or cross country skis will do just fine.

The key variables in that calculation are the price of natural gas as a replacement fuel and the price of any eventual tax on carbon dioxide emissions. If there's no carbon tax, the company says, the utilization of its coal fleet is likely to remain steady at 80 to 90 percent. Alternatively, if PacifiCorp faces a combination of low gas prices and high CO2 tax, it could reduce the coal plant utilization rate to 35 percent by 2030. Most scenarios included a reduction in utilization, meaning ratepayers would foot the overhead for running plants less efficiently.
