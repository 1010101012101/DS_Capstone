Roy did provide a measure of hope, albeit a tenuous dose, in his first action since missing three games with a sore left knee. He scored a game-high 27 points on 10-of-20 shooting, with bursts of explosion and his first dunk of the season, a two-hand dunk in transition that he said he wanted to layin, but had to dunk because of a closing Trevor Ariza.

"This sale is completely out of step with the United States' stated commitment to reform in Bahrain," said Brian Dooley of Human Rights First. "Where is the progress that warrants the reward of arms? This new sale will only damage U.S. credibility among those working for democracy in Bahrain and across the Middle East."
James, who said his arm is not broken but that his elbow was dislocated, declared he would wear a Ducks uniform again this season. Oregon coach Chip Kelly said he wasn't sure about the extent of the injury. Running backs coach Gary Campbell said he certainly hoped James returns. Everyone in Ducks Nation would agree. But if he's not, in the short term, or at all, the Ducks likely could be OK in the running back department.

"I love Sullinger and he knows how to use his body, he's long, but he's not a super athlete. He's not going to jump over people in the Big Ten. His offensive moves are very much direct. He's putting his shoulder down and banging people back and attacking the basket, which I love.
The new G.I. Joe's must rekindle that passion so it can focus on winning over new customers, said Debra Ringold, dean of Willamette University's Atkinson Graduate School of Management. The concern, she said, is that a beloved brand can erode in the face of stiff competition, especially when a company is off the scene for a while.
That's hard to answer. Anarchist and philosopher John Zerzan argues that anarchy is the original state of humankind. Its etymology can be traced to the ancient Greeks. Some would say that the United States and the freedoms that it encourages are fertile ground for anarchism. American anarchist Benjamin Tucker wrote in 1888 that "Anarchists are simply unterrified Jeffersonian Democrats. They believe that 'the best government is that which governs least,' and that that which governs least is no government at all. Even the simple police function of protecting person and property they deny to governments supported by compulsory taxation."

"A few years ago, he would've had a hard time being out there, knowing he's got to hold back," teammate Luol Deng said. "He's matured so much that he still knows how to be effective even though he's not 100 percent. Last game, even though he wasn't attacking or anything, he was still running the offense, running the team. He did a great job doing that."

The station also said photographs had been retouched to show fire damage, not earthquake ruins. They didn't mention that the 1906 disaster occurred at the birth of photojournalism and reports of the event, most illustrated and many extremely lurid, circulated throughout the country. It would have been pretty tough to pretend that the skeletal ruins of the City Hall, the most famous picture from 1906, was caused by fire.

Sensible changes, however, are being shouted down by demagogues who portray any change in Social Security as an attack on the elderly.

The trade was a four-player deal. In addition to Pineda, the Yankees acquired 19-year-old Jose Campos, a hard-throwing right-hander who is considered a mid-level pitching prospect.

Coach Schiano's answer was that he takes the time to meet the parents and the family as well as the player and his HS coaches. He does his best to bring kids into his program who he feels would fit in as mature, respectful men. He admitted that it is always possible to make a mistake and have a kid come in who ends up being disruptive. And if that is the case, he will give that kid a chance to prove it may have just been a lapse in judgment, and not a pattern. But if that player continues to be a problem then he will be gone. He cannot watch each kid 24/7 like a mother can. But he hopes he can take a kid whose family built a great foundation and help that child become a responsible man. "Kevin will have to be responsible for Kevin, but I can help him prosper to his fullest." It was an honest answer and not fluff.

Effects of the newly approved, bare-bones state budget are already being felt in programs ranging from child care to university tuition and access. But leaders of California's judicial system, the largest in the nation, say courts up and down the state will be hit hard as well, with cuts of $350 million in operations and $310 million in a courthouse construction fund that once could be tapped for emergencies.

In terms of what will be happening on stage, Mintel's jazz musicians and Dawson's classical singers promise to seamlessly mesh as they perform Brubeck's notated choral scores. These scores also contain sections where the jazz musicians are meant to improvise, which means that Mintel and the other three jazz musicians will spontaneously take the music wherever it leads them; as these improvised sections reach some sort of resolution, Dawson's choral forces will rejoin the musicians for another notated section.
Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics' economy.com, said the House-passed bill would eliminate up to 700,000 jobs over the next two years and shave 0.5 percentage points from gross domestic product growth for 2011. His assessment reflected similar warnings last week from Goldman Sachs.
This collapse in gas prices is putting a strain on Chesapeake and the industry. Chesapeake's share price is down more than 70% from its 2008 high. But Mr. McClendon sees the pipe as half-full, a period of transition during which the rush of new supply will drive more demand and create a larger market. "The price problem is really a price opportunity from the consumer perspective and of course there are more consumers than there are producers. And so the opportunity that's presented on the demand side is really quite remarkable and will be fundamental to the way American businesses compete in the world."
In an often combative cross-examination, the government's first witness, congressional staffer Phil Barnett, told Hardin that the questions and answers could have informed legislation, such as classifying HGH as a controlled substance.

But Barnett said that no legislation was passed as a result of the hearing.

-- Most flash sale deals for hotel and resort accommodations focus on up-market options. The prices may be very good for what you get, but they generally aren't the lowest you could find. Several recent postings I've seen, for example, cover big discounts on high-end hotels in Las Vegas. Surely, $100 for a room that generally goes for $200 is a good deal -- the room might well be a big suite with Jacuzzi -- but if you're satisfied with a standard room in a four- or five-star Strip hotel, you can find one for well under $100 through Hotwire or Priceline.

Both said the Keystone XL pipeline is designed to divert heavy crude tar sands oil from the Midwest -- where it has overwhelmed refinery demand and depressed the price of crude -- to Gulf Coast refineries, where much of it can be exported to international markets.

In this unanticipated roller-coaster journey to determine which Republican will face President Obama in the fall, Oregon's March 19 presidential debate has sudden significance.

If those minutes are accurate, then the Giants' claim to San Jose and the South Bay could indeed rest on more shaky ground than once believed. The A's obviously interpret it in that fashion. On the other hand, if MLB agreed 100 percent with that interpretation, the Giants' rights would have been dismissed long ago. And, indeed, the Giants released their own statement later Wednesday, asserting that their rights have been "reaffirmed by Major League Baseball on four separate occasions."

We have emergency room people on the sidelines as we do for any normal NFL game.

Santorum emerged from the contest far stronger than he entered it, having transformed himself from a political has-been to a leader of the party's evangelical and non-establishment wings.

Controversies can be wonderfully clarified when people follow the logic of illogical premises to perverse conclusions. For example, two academics recently wrote in the British Journal of Medical Ethics that "after-birth abortions" -- killing newborn babies -- are matters of moral indifference because newborns, like fetuses, "do not have the same moral status as actual persons" and "the fact that both are potential persons is morally irrelevant." So killing them "should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled." This helpfully validates the right-to-life contention that the pro-abortion argument, which already defends third-trimester abortions, contains no standard for why the killing should be stopped by arbitrarily assigning moral significance to the moment of birth.
The Spanish-style home, built in 1924, is described in the listing as an "opportunity to remodel … or to build a new home."

The Knicks were said to be close to a deal with Smith at press time. They had an experienced man in position, I guess. The Clippers only had promises. But in a negotiation such as this, with the teams willing to one-up each other, and Smith holding all the leverage, I'll wait to see Smith receiving a bounce pass from Lin/Paul to make the call.

That's more undrafted rookies than the Rams usually sign, but only because the NFL decided to increase the offseason/training camp roster size to 90 players - or 10 more than usual - shortly before the draft.

The Browns need to take Claiborne at 4. The drop-off at corner is considerable while positions like WR and RB have depth in this draft. Getting Wright or Stephen Hill at 22 and Doug Martin at 37 will give us 3 playmakers and give us one of the best secondaries in football.

It would be a major step if the debacles in Iraq and Afghanistan created a significant change in this. As the world's largest arms dealer, with a war expenditure higher than the next sixteen countries combined, America has found new rationales in every generation for not reducing weapons expenditure. At this point, most of the pressure is political. The right wing is more or less a permanent war-friendly party.

The right pumped up terrorism into a war on terror instead of dealing with it sensibly, as a police action, the way counterinsurgency experts recommend and the way that Britain dealt with the I.R.A.

Spurgeon also pointed out the bill was for both water and sewer usage. Of course it was. Sewer fees are added into every bill the city sends to users of both the city's water and sewer services, because the charge for wastewater treatment is based on the number of gallons used. But residential bills don't usually amount to hundreds of dollars, let alone thousands. And if the meter worked properly, as Zimmerman said, then why would the consumption, and thus the dollar amount, drop so dramatically from one billing cycle to the next?

Of course, it’s Mark Wahlberg who’s the star, and who pushed this project into production. He’s rock-solid in the ring, and truly affecting in the film’s quieter moments — as he sits tongue-tied on a couch while his older sisters and new girlfriend sling insults over his head.
Meanwhile, the study is also producing a wealth of information about cougars and what they eat:
"We fully anticipate that our public officials will, in fact, make public a proposal that calls for spending millions of dollars in public funds on a public facility. It's the right thing to do," Robbins said in a statement. "The public has a right to know how its tax money could be spent. We don't see how a so-called confidentiality agreement benefits the public, and we certainly cannot imagine how it could trump state laws that protect the public's right to know."
Making matters worse for the Knicks: Amare Stoudemire cut his left hand in a postgame incident, requiring stitches. The Knicks did not immediately release any details on how it happened, and coach Mike Woodson -- who saw the cut -- declined to offer specifics.

‘‘Absolutely. That's their call,'' he said after pitching a scoreless inning. ‘‘I've said it from the first day of spring training. I'm going to do what they need me to do and what fits best for the team. And obviously what's best for the team is for me to come into a game like that or get a run up.''
"It's the least expensive per mile cost of any startup in recent history," Fraim said. "We got great value for the investment." He called The Tide a "resounding success" that has proven to be a viable transportation alternative.

In the best-case scenario, inspectors would return to apartment buildings and other "high-hazard" properties every year, not every five years, according to the fire marshal's report. At a minimum, routine code inspections should take place every three years to account for "changes in staff at the property, new hazards being introduced and construction/modeling changes," according to the report.

She has modified the nest, made it taller, steeper. She has laid 6 eggs. We wonder if the two sterile eggs laid by Mother Goose could be mixed in with the new goose's eggs? We'll have to wait and see. Her eggs will probably hatch sometime during the week of May 7-13. That's just a guess. It takes 28 days for the eggs to hatch and it took us a few days to realize she was on the nest. We'll keep a close eye and let you know when things start to pop. Have fun watching.

In reds, prices range from $32 for 2007 Chateau de Mattes-Sabran Dionysos Corbieres from Languedoc to $180 for a 2005 Chateau Lynch Bages Bordeaux.

Everyone agrees with you, Dan, that a commercial bank would not make a loan to a company in the situation you describe. Observers also agree that all of the Big Three are hemorrhaging cash at an unsustainable rate and that at least two of them face the prospect of running out of money soon. The crisis in the industry is the reason Congress is considering offering the companies credit or loan guarantees to keep them afloat. Commercial lenders are unwilling to take on the risk of making new loans, and private investors are steering clear of the auto industry and its problems. The U.S. government is the only institution with the resources and time horizon to accept the risk of huge new loans.
O’Neal was in the city Sunday to announce that his development company will help renovate the city’s lone movie theater, adding six screens and 20,000 square feet to the building.

Kyle Kosier (Dallas): The Ravens have had no contact with Kosier’s agent since the 33-year-old was released by the Dallas Cowboys, so that’s probably a sign that they are not interested, and focused on other options. But Kosier, a veteran of 10 NFL seasons, is one of the more accomplished guards available. He’s been a fixture on Dallas’ offensive line for five of the past six seasons. The Ravens signed another long-time Cowboy in lineman Andre Gurode to serve as insurance last season and Kosier gives them the option of doing that again.

Clooney is the celebrity might and some of the money behind the Satellite Sentinel Project, which hired Longmont's DigitalGlobe to photograph the civil-war-torn Sudan region of Africa. His purpose?

I crossed off two "bucket list" items on my South American trip because I also visited the Galapagos Islands, straddled across the equator 600 miles west of Ecuador. These are the isles Charles Darwin visited in 1835 — before he wrote "The Origin of Species" — an archipelago containing fascinating giant tortoises, assorted lizards and iguanas, finches and blue-footed boobies, equatorial penguins and scads of California sea lions, not to mention dazzling sunsets and a striking serenity.

"Winning wasn't crossing my mind at that point. The back nine can be penal with all the water, but you can score on it," he said. "You never know what can happen. This is the craziest game ever."
Writers walk the tables too, looking for ideas to steal. There's no shame in this. Shakespeare pilfered old stories of princes who feigned madness for characters and plot points in "Hamlet." Modern writers in turn pilfer "Hamlet" for characters and plot points, in works like Tom Stoppard's "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead" and David Wroblewski's "The Story of Edgar Sawtelle."
Dombrowski said Young isnt allowed to be around the team during his suspension, which was announced at about 7 p.m. When he was around the team this afternoon, Young hadnt yet been suspended.

Some of what sets Frameline35 apart is apparent from the program: lots of films about transgender people and issues, more American-made features than we've seen in recent years and, above all, simply a lot more films - 231. But what you won't see until the lights go down in the theater is how much the quality of LGBT filmmaking - from theme, to characterization, to directorial sophistication and production values - has matured.

Which isn't to say this year's Oscars will be a battle of the blockbusters. There are still plenty of fine small, or smallish, films in the running -- "Milk," " Frost/Nixon," " Frozen River," "Wendy and Lucy," "Rachel Getting Married" -- and there's even the return of Mickey Rourke in "The Wrestler." They all fall into what has become the traditional awards template -- heart-wrenching, fraught, moments of black despair. But with Pixar lobbying for "Wall-E" as a best picture (as opposed to best animated picture) nominee and its recent claim on that award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn., it could be a surprisingly rich and varied race this year.

Further, the second main argument of my earlier op-ed piece is ignored: that the criminal prosecution of Mr. Schurick and Julius Henson constituted selective prosecution; that is, prosecution against those representing Republican interests.

Portland had at one time over 200 cast-iron buildings downtown. The first one came down in 1928 and lots more were demolished in the following half century, many to be replaced by surface parking lots.

The Chesapeake thrived fabulously on this diet. Its shallowness, its two-layered flows of freshwater riding atop salt, its structures of filtering shellfish and burrowing worms and clams, its vast grass beds that could absorb and rerelease nutrients — all of this and more enabled the bay to retain, recycle, and recycle again whatever food it could get.
