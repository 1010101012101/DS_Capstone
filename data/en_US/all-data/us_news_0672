Downey's performance also succeeds because it's grounded in reality. The Marvel comics' flying, beam-shooting man starts life as Tony Stark, filthy rich defense contractor, playboy, and gifted inventor. The film brings Stark into the present day by dropping him into Afghanistan where he is nearly blown up, abducted by terrorists, and fitted with a strange new device in the middle of his chest. He whips up an armored suit that looks like robot-from-outer-space-guy, and later makes a better one.

Agave offers no advantage in terms of caloric content: about 16 calories per teaspoon, the same as table sugar. But the syrup's chemical makeup can differ significantly from that of other sweeteners. Whereas table sugar is composed of sucrose, which is broken down to yield half fructose and half glucose, agave can contain up to 90% fructose, Shelke says. That increase in fructose means -- theoretically, at least -- that agave nectar doesn't result in the same dangerous spikes in blood glucose that other sweeteners can cause in diabetics.

Goalie swap: Goaltender Jeremy Smith was returned to Milwaukee and Chet Pickard came back to Nashville from Milwaukee.
But the book has kept popping up over the years, in inconvenient places in curators' heads. It is overrated in a way; "Sunshine Muse" was never meant to be what it became: the (or even a) definitive book on L.A. art. We could start with a term from its subtitle, "West Coast," which means from the Canadian to the Mexican borders, and not just "advanced art in Los Angeles." And it was certainly never meant to stand alone for 37 years as the lone overview of modern art in Southern California.
This comes as a shock to some people, that the president would have a war on something. But this is consistent.

The layout represents an ingenious use of shipboard space. Cabins are on decks 11 and 12, with the lounge near midship. All studio cabins are located on either side of a central corridor, on the center of the ship and between rows of conventional inside cabins on either side. Only studio passengers use the central corridor. The advantage is a certain level of privacy and separation of studio occupants from the other 4,000 or so cruisers; the downside is that occupants of the far fore and fore aft studios have a long schlep to the lounge. Following a transatlantic cruise in late June, Norwegian Epic will operate seven- and 14-night Eastern and Western Caribbean cruises from Miami.

Like most other places the Spanish padres set up shop along the Pacific Coast back in the day, Santa Cruz and grapes go way back. But all these years later, only a handful of the dozens of wineries have achieved much in the way of far-and-wide notoriety. Bonny Doon is one of them, long-running but recently shrunk down and smartened up in a major way by honcho Randall Grahm, a classically quirky Santa Cruz type. Start here. You can forgo the trek up to the mountaintop winery and just hit their excellent Cellar Door Café and tasting room in downtown Santa Cruz (bonnydoonvineyard.com). Afterwards, stop in for a tasting flight at Vinocruz, which stocks over 150 wines from more than 60 wineries in the region (725 Front St.).

But we could buy your farm. Go back to your kitchen table and think about this some more. Maybe what you really want to do is sell the farm rather than expect the federal government to restore the levees that the federal government is responsible for.'"

"In many ways John and I were different," she wrote in "Saving Graces." "I had traveled the world; he had never left the South.... But we had each moved from place to place, following our fathers' jobs. We had each lived in company housing — military bases for me, mill villages for John. Neither of us had a chance to be rooted in a place, so we were rooted in family and faith, the things we took with us."

The defense industry is being paid $2 billion a week to run two wars, and the political action committee money from military contractors to every politician is too bountiful to pass up.

If Hill's effulgence dazzled the SOPAC crowd, her backing band occasionally threatened to overwhelm the house sound system. But the frontwoman held the group together, conducting her musicians shrewdly, reining them in when they got too rowdy, and whipping them up into a froth for the emotional climaxes of the songs. Since the release of "Miseducation," Hill has acquired a reputation for erratic performances and unwelcome stage antics, occasionally prompting refund demands from concertgoers. There was no sign of that at SOPAC. Instead, the sold-out house watched a woman who seems to have, quite literally, gotten her act together. The genre-blurring set at SOPAC was exactly what Fabolous' surprise rap-rock show at Summer Jam should have been; Fabo's musical imagination is limited, while Hill's seems to have no ceiling. Her upcoming concert at the Rock The Bells festival at Randall's Island ought to be fascinating.

With its Jules Verne meets Steve Jobs meets Queen Victoria look, it may be the first Steampunk hotel. But if you aren't familiar with Steampunk's high-tech Victorian hybrids, don't like deafening restaurants, can't read tiny type on menus in the dark and prefer to wake up to something other than beer bottles clanking into the recycling bin, the Redbury might be your idea of wretched excess. If you can ignore the rough patches, the hotel's location, room size and wicked-cool decor make it an exceptional choice for a night on the town or a week spent finishing your screenplay.

Once Strayed started writing long, sincere responses to questions for advice, the reaction was overwhelming. One column, "Tiny Beautiful Things," got 75,000 hits its first week. Dear Sugar has more than 7,500 Twitter followers and about the same number on Facebook, but it's the emotional reaction that's more meaningful than the number of unique visitors.

Nevertheless, they are united in their contempt for President Obama. A collateral consequence of the long Republican primary campaign is that, when they were not attacking each other, all the GOP contenders blasted the president from every angle in the long series of debates, in attack ads and on the stump. After months of this, it is hard to imagine some damage has not been done to the incumbent.

Wyden says the attacks from Democrats are misdirected. Health care, especially Medicare, has long been a "passion" he said. Moreover, he notes that other independent positions he's taken eventually became accepted party policy -- getting rid of tax breaks for oil companies, forcing politicians to "stand by their ad," assuring a free and accessible Internet, and sharply questioning the government's desire to secretly monitor citizens.

He was an awesome guy to work with, and he was so protective of me at a time when I really needed it. I had death threats, and he didn't let anybody get near me. He was my rock.

Nothing can make a very old pet young again, but eliminating chronic pain comes pretty close.

The revelation comes as other problems have come to light over property taxes. Earlier this month, state officials revoked tax breaks from more than 550 homes in the city, based on a Sun analysis showing owners had been improperly getting the homestead property tax credit on multiple homes.

But for Edgren having Alfie Boe in her life is more than a lark. For her it's deeply emotional and meaningful  as she found out when her little grandson Aidan was diagnosed with cancer. The Alfie fans she had met online offered support  emotional, spiritual and material. One of her online friends in the UK managed to get a request to Boe asking him to dedicate a song to Aidan, who passed away before his second birthday. In a concert in Birmingham, England, Boe did just that. The song was Bring Him Home.

Because the dolphins were so decomposed, Hung said, it was impossible to rule out a theory promoted by the sea mammal conservation group Orca, which initially publicized the dolphin die-off.

The little boy's dream changed then. It was just as well. The Ben Franklin glasses weren't a prop. "Blind as a bat" is not a happy annotation on a resume for a would-be Army aviator.
Kyle Lohse started to falter in the fourth inning as he walked two batters. A slick double play started by Lance Berkman at first base and finished by Berkman at first base helped Lohse escape that inning without giving up a run.

After the speed horses lose steam, here come the stalkers. This is where Union Rags(9-2) could shine. The hype was Macy's balloon-sized for this horse, who was undefeated as a 2-year-old until the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, where he came in second. The can't-get-around-it question is his performance in the Florida Derby: He met with congestion, resulting in a third-place finish. If he's such a champion, why couldn't he at least push up to second?
The trouble is, a lot of that pension money comes from taxpayers -- the very people who are cheated when elected officials and others who are supposed to be public servants sell their influence or their votes.
As much as I miss the Dodger Dogs, I won't step foot in that stadium until Bryan Stow walks in there on his own and throws out the first pitch.
Some call the battle the "Gettysburg of the West." Early in 1862, Confederate Gen. Henry H. Sibley headed north from El Paso, Texas, with about 3,500 soldiers on horseback.

In a feat of editing misdirection, it appeared that Freitag would almost certainly survive tonight's challenges, which first involved invoking umami, the "fifth taste," in traditional Japanese yakitori, and then creating a five-piece bento box with each dish incorporating rice and each representing one of the five tastes. Her poached blue fish in a ponzu-yuzu dashi broth was hailed as "amazing," and guest judge Dr. Yukio Hattori, a commentator on the original Japanese "Iron Chef," singled her out for inventive use of different kinds of rice and rice-based ingredients. Which was, last we checked, a major part of the challenge.

Take the unusual, but compelling "Always Right." Beginning with a quick bit of barrelhouse piano, Knopf wrenches a fuzzy, electronic beat and rubbery bass out of the ether.

According to Roth, it is often easier for children to recognize the disconnect between how humans treat pets versus factory farmed animals, than it is for adults, who are set in their own ways. "Children respond with such excitement to their own empowerment," Roth says. "When you give them tangible ideas about things that they can choose to do to be healthier, to help save the environment, and to help save animals from unbearable conditions, they make choices with a knowing and instinct unburdened by studies, authority figures, pyramid charts, or statistics. They just feel it."

Background: I grew up in a small town in Ohio. After graduating from college, I handled an outside sales territory in New England for a national manufacturing company. A territory change brought me to Iowa in the late 1980s. In the mid-90s, my employer was purchased by a larger corporation, and I knew it was time for a change.

Once again, I felt the direction shifting and knew it was time to make another change. In 2011, I started my own law firm.

Likewise, he said he would not fight to block abortion rights but changed his position on that and pronounced himself pro-life while governor.
