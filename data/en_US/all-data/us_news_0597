Not that he's apologizing. When the state realized it had misplaced $320 million several months ago, Daniels treated it like a joke, talking like a college student who'd just found $20 worth of beer money in an old pair of jeans, as if important budget decisions hadn't been made on the faulty numbers. And on Thursday the state put out a news release that downplayed the newest mistake, writing of "programming errors" and mentioning not the $206 million but the smaller "$13 million per month" mistake.

The groups have argued that Wal-Mart, the largest U.S. private employer with 1.4 million workers, doesn't pay fair wages or provide adequate health care. They have said the company's big-box stores are eyesores that crush small businesses and wreak havoc on traffic and commerce in local communities. They have complained that Wal-Mart hasn't taken responsibility for its impact on the environment. And they have complained that the company buys too many goods overseas.
I'm all for the right to peaceful assembly and protest, just as I appreciate a free press, so you and I can share our opinions on things. While I appreciate that the "Occupy" folks are trying to make a difference, I'm not sure they've yet communicated any proposal for a real solution to our nation's economic woes.

Sandick wondered whether prosecutors could have done a better job of preparing the jury for Pettitte's admission of some uncertainty.

In the long history of bad movies about bad illnesses, "A Little Bit of Heaven" just might be the worst. When you get right down to it, the point here seems to be that it would be a horrible thing were Kate Hudson to get colon cancer. And I agree. I like her. She's good even in this movie, which is saying something. But if terminal colon cancer is the worst thing that could happen to her, "A Little Bit of Heaven" might be the second worst.

Arrieta's sub-par junior year knocked him out of the first round. And whispers that he and his agent, Scott Boras, were asking for more than $1 million sunk him further. Teams weren't interested at that price. So Arrieta attended a draft party with friends and family and became increasingly embarrassed. Finally, the Orioles, who didn't have a second- or third-round pick, bit. They selected him in the fifth round, giving him an eye-popping $1.1 million signing bonus.

Earplugs also help block some of the engine noise, allowing you to sleep. I always carry earplugs or noise-canceling headphones, and an eye mask on longer flights. It's the only way to rest, and nothing stops a chatty seatmate who can't buy a clue like earplugs and blinders.
Hey, Mary Kay: Our defense is closer to competing in our division than our offense is. Wouldn't it make sense to get those final pieces for our young defense in this draft and let the so-called "offensive gurus" we have on our staff coach up the offense? If we can re-sign D'Qwell Jackson and get a top prospect at defensive end and cornerback in the first round, and comeback and with more defensive tackle depth behind the mammoth duo of Rubin and Taylor, we might have the makings of a truly dominant defense. -- Kellen Kelly, Los Angeles, Calif.

"Our defense came out to play. We shut down who we wanted to shut down. We wanted to shut out big No. 38 (running back Michael Scherer). He's a monster," Burroughs senior linebacker Nick Rassieur said. "They have kind of a young quarterback and we wanted to put pressure on him and keep him running around."
I don’t want to end on a pessimistic note. I, too, think we did very well. Second-rounder Vinny Curry was a steal (though what does taking a defensive end this early say about Brandon Graham’s future). Brandon Boykin, the cornerback we took in the fourth round, fills the Asante-less depth problem we had there and, best of all, he may finally give us a top-flight kick and punt returner. Late-round offensive lineman Dennis Kelly, of Purdue, and Brandon Washington, of Miami, seem to bring real value that late, and sixth-rounder Marvin McNutt may not be Michael Floyd, but he’s big, strong and was All-Big Ten with 1,315 yards and 12 touchdowns (answer to our red-zone woes?).

Minutemen. The illegal-immigrant-hating zealots imploded in 2007 and became so factionalized they ended up suing themselves. It's too complicated (and, frankly, too boring) to go through the whole mess, but suffice to say that the group that Chief Whack Job Jim Gilchrist founded basically exists in little more than name only. Deborah Courtney, Barbara Coe and Eileen Garcia are only the better known members to have abandoned him. Courtney - whom I think has a good heart but a misplaced sense of justice - is a member of a faction that sued Gilchrist for control of what is known on paper as the Minuteman Project.

When Obama says he'll "stabilize" the budget outlook, he really means he's doing nothing to reverse the trend. The so-called $3 trillion in "additional deficit reduction" isn't a reduction at all. It's just a deceitful way of saying that the cumulative deficit over the next 10 years will be $7 trillion instead of $10 trillion in the baseline estimate. In other words, the national debt will increase by $7 trillion.

I can support innovative revenue sources to help make a new stadium possible, including some of those the U-T describes.

Beer collaborations have been a growing trend for several years now. Typically, two breweries team up to create a recipe and brew a limited-release beer that showcases the talents of both companies and the convivial nature of the craft-brewing world.

Cat litter: Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease that can be transmitted through the feces of infected cats. Cats can only get infected if they hunt and eat rodents or if their owners feed them raw meat. And as a rule, even an infected cat can only transmit the disease for two weeks in its entire life. It's rare for people to get toxoplasmosis from their cats, but the disease is very dangerous for pregnant women because it can lead to birth defects or miscarriages. Have someone else clean your cat's litter box, or wear rubber gloves while you do it, and wash your hands very well after you're done. Change the litter every day (the protozoa in cat feces can't infect anyone until the feces are at least a day old). Still, remember: The most common way for people to get toxoplasmosis is by eating undercooked meat.

There's Jonathan (De Niro), an angry, bigoted old man with some of the trappings, a bit of the discipline and all of the bravado of a celebrated "artist." He tells one and all that there are three "classic American writers," and that he's one of them. He's never been published, never held a real job for any real length of time. But his ego buries that reality behind delusions of talent and the glory that will come when "my masterpiece, 'The Button Man," is published.

If you ask the right questions, though, Williams will tell you his life story. You have to lean in close to hear it, because the chaos of an NFL locker room doesn't pause, or quiet down, and offer up an environment that welcomes deep reflection. When Williams talks about how he arrived at this moment, how he became a starting cornerback on a playoff team that has a real chance to make it to the Super Bowl, it's not just a story about an late-round draft pick from a Division II school who defied the odds and became an unlikely NFL success story. It's also a gesture of faith. It requires a measure of vulnerability.

"If you lose by 30-something points, you question the intensity," admitted James. He added that the Cavs have not lost their identity as a defensive team, although the 30-30-40 body-slam Boston delivered in points in the last three quarters certainly argues that Brown's "five men on a string" concept of defense has become a ball of yarn with which the Celtics toy.

Six days after Bridget McCarthy spoke with the police - on May 19, 2004 - Dwyer brought Kevin McCarthy and Denham in to meet with detectives at the Area 3 detective headquarters at Belmont and Western. That's when Kevin McCarthy changed his story, agreeing now that his wife had told the truth in identifying Vanecko and Denham, describing an argument that began when their group had bumped into Koschman and his friends and developed into "pushing, shoving and name-calling" and ended with Koschman on the ground, none of them sure how.

Kansas City had gone 17-39 in the previous four seasons when Levy took over as coach in 1978. The Chiefs went 4-12 his first year, then 7-9, 8-8 and 9-7. At Buffalo, Levy took over after back-to-back 2-14 seasons and a poor start in 1986.

Reteaming with Oscar-winning cinematographer Chris Menges, who shot "The Reader," the director has kept much of the film awash in sunlight despite its subject and filled with details that make it feel specific to New York and yet universally familiar.

For, most assuredly, these figures on the whole are portrayed not as solemn men of sober duty but rather as worldly leaders of a vastly powerful and wealthy global institution that, writes Norwich, today counts "two billion members, representing as it does half of all Christians and about one-sixth of the global population." For Catholics and non-Catholics alike, this is surely an extraordinary feat, one, he suggests, that is built upon a short passage in the Gospels, Christ's pronouncement to St. Peter: "Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church."

One of the major problems with ionization smoke alarms is that they give off too many false alarms - mostly from cooking and showers. When a smoke alarm goes off every time someone cooks bacon, people remove the battery or take down the smoke alarm. Manufacturers require them to be installed away from kitchens and bathrooms, but there is no hard and fast rule for clearance requirements across different manufacturers. Some cities, such as Minneapolis, have implemented even stricter requirements for ionization smoke alarms; they require smoke alarms that are within 20' of a cooking appliance to either be of the photoelectric type, or to have a hush button.

This gives us the best opportunity."

It didn’t matter that the lifelong Union County resident had no professional radio experience. He had passion for new music, an ear for an intriguing new sound and a gigantic collection of his own (Russo owns more than 100,000 recordings). In November 2008, just months after the New York-based commercial radio station switched from a smooth jazz format to one grounded in alternative rock, Russo launched his own show. Like Scelsa’s "Idiot’s Delight," Russo’s "Anything Anything" is free-form. And just like Scelsa, Russo made sure his program aired on Sunday night. "Anything Anything" hits the airwaves at 9 p.m., and doesn’t sign off until 11.

After Couvron in Portland, I opened the New York City version in 2004 and stuck with that for a year or so before I sold it. The pressures of dealing with big rent and expenses were tough. After that, I cooked for a while at a restaurant in Michigan, then came back to the Pacific Northwest. My last job before Noisette was as executive chef, then chef de cuisine at The Herbfarm, north of Seattle. It is a great restaurant but wasn't the right fit for me. And I always intended to get back to Portland and open my own place again.

And instead we rush through the mall, write and sign and mail our Christmas letters, bake dozens of cookies, put up hundreds of lights around the yard and in the house, get our homes ready for the loved ones who will be coming to visit, or ready ourselves for our own trips to see family who live far away. And if for some reason we choose not to do some or all of those things, there's a high likelihood that we'll manage to feel guilty and frazzled anyway, either because it means that we're not going to have the Christmas we most desire, or because it means that we're not living up to someone else's expectations. It can feel like a no-win situation.

He notes that people want to listen to digital music not just at their PCs and on their MP3 players, but in the living room and in the car. Yet there are still technological hurdles for making a subscription service truly ubiquitous -- he sees current services at "an interim stage of incompatibility." A related problem, he says, is price -- he thinks current monthly prices ($12 to $15 at Rhapsody and Napster to Go) are too high given that subscription services are an adjunct to other methods of consuming music, not a replacement for them. (This was what ultimately made me leave Rhapsody -- I liked the service, but I spent a lot more time listening to things I'd already downloaded on iTunes than I did using Rhapsody to try out new tracks.)

A: I think one, it's a film that, as much as it's war, it's human beings at war. It's couples and mothers and children and fathers and sons and friends. The human side of it, it's natural to have all of these things. And the cast themselves are from the area, and they lived through the war, and they are naturally funny people, they're artistic people, they're fascinating and are interesting and attractive people. So all of that comes through as it would, because people from the former Yugoslavia have all of these wonderful things to bring to film.
Jason Renaud, a volunteer with the Mental Health Association of Portland, said all of the people shot by police in the last year -- Lagozzino is the sixth person shot by Portland officers in 2010 -- have either suffered mental illness or untreated addiction.

They need a second option other than lethal force," Renaud said.

Peter and his classmates, seniors at a Roman Catholic boarding school, lead a sheltered, privileged life. But in the throes of adolescence, they aren't sheltered from themselves.
3. Pau Gasol. His role may have downshifted as the Lakers' main post option to becoming a facilitator. But he still remains dangerous so long as he plays aggressively. Other than wanting to rectify last year's disappearing act in the postseason and giving the Lakers front office no excuse to trade him this off-season, I can't think of anything else that would keep him motivated.
At the bottom of the stairs in Du Cane's office basement lurks a large, free-standing pull-up bar. Each time he passes it, he uses it. Since he's frequently in the basement for meetings or a snack, he's at that pull-up bar about 10 times a day.

Excerpt: "It's fun to be Feb. 11 and still be in the hunt, and still have the guys talking about the next game being really important." (coach Dana) Altman said. "We had to get Washington or we were going to be way behind them (in the standings) and our guys found a way to do that. It'll be the same with Cal — we have to find a way. We know we've got a long ways to go yet to be the team we want to be in March."
But the presidential candidates are simply the top of a cesspool. Rep. Doug Lamborn (R-Colo.) said of Obama that he didn't "even want to have to be associated with him. It's like touching a tar baby and you get it, you're stuck."
Bah humbug!
It’s not a stretch to say this wonderful, beautiful season had its origins in Game 80 of 82 last year, a must-have match in which the Rangers went down 3-0 to the Bruins and somehow rallied back against the eventual champs, precisely the kind of grind-it-out effort for which they’ve rightly earned so much praise across this year’s 82.
Power rankings don't tend to carry much weight because they're, well, power rankings. But one such list of the NFL's top coaches compiled by the National Football Post caught our attention.

But some council members, in a series of contentious committee meetings leading up to the vote, accused Mayor Frank Jackson's administrators of being disingenuous in characterizing their new efforts as taking a fresh look at solving the city's overwhelming trash problem.
The magnitude of the calamity overshadows the question of the disaster photographs' status as artworks. Klett is on safe ground here, as his rephotography project has conceptual as well as documentary and even sociopolitical claims to art status. But the case for putting "1906 Earthquake" into an art museum rests on the fact that no institution could have presented it better and on the irresolvably ambiguous artistic standing of a great many documentary photographs.
On these household courts, C.J. Paul made Chris Paul, and Taylor Griffin made Blake Griffin.
It's hard not to.
In home-and-home agreements, money isn't a big influence "because you're basically just sharing expenses back and forth," De Carolis said. Factors that weigh more heavily, Washington athletic director Scott Woodward said, are distance, weather and toughness of the opponent.

That stock conversion was subject to shareholder approval and will take place Wednesday morning.
Lang said the net loss would be covered by better-than-expected ticket sales for SDSU during the 2011 season. Before the season, SDSU projected that it would sell $1.92 million in tickets for seven home games. Instead, it ended up with $2.357 million. SDSU finished with an 8-5 record last season, including the 32-30 loss at the Louisiana Superdome.

Unlike some of those tony, big-bill steakhouses, the Buggy Whip includes soup and salad with the price of the meal. Great idea, but the salad is barely worth eating, featuring iceberg lettuce with dressing ladled over the top, and the greens are not tossed. The soup was fine  hearty and thick  but we agreed it shouldn't come with an extra charge.
He wanted loyalty, he said.

In this long, slow slog of an election year, it's certainly easy to think that our country is a more sinister and dysfunctional place than the one of our youth. But every once in a while it's good to take note of these small triumphs that happen every day, out of view from the headlines and TV cameras.
Indeed, the highlight of the evening could have been when the pair slid to center stage for an acoustic bit that dipped into the past. Because it seemed like most of the "new'' hits from B&D feature Dunn's voice, we forget that the early years were a true collaboration, almost a you-sing-one, I'll-sing-one deal. So the acoustic set reinforced memories of those early harmonies when Dunn sang Roger Miller's "Husbands and Wives'' and Brooks launched into "Lost and Found.''
The Sun editorial board is prone to making stupid and inane statements, but the blanket statement that "Iraq had no nuclear, chemical or biological weapons nor any prospects for building them at the time of the invasion" ("Home for Christmas," Dec. 2) may be the stupidest and most easily refutable ever written.

The loss of business is critical in a recession-battered state vitally dependent on visitor spending.
"Folks were pretty excited. It was a pretty special moment and a great show," said Adrienne Watson, an aide to Rep.

Heading down Taylor, the next segment takes us from Fisherman's Wharf to the Ferry Building. Following the Embarcadero to the base of Telegraph Hill, and attempting to circle the hill along the fire boundary line gets tricky, though -- streets repeatedly dead end, and trying to find through-streets can get annoying. A map is particularly handy here.
... that the McDonald's in Homewood refused to give me two packets of salad dressing (unless I paid for them) that the McDonald's in Kankakee forgot to include in my bag with the two salads that I had ordered. Now I see why people check their orders before leaving.

And even as he joined the battle, Obama immediately volleyed the substantive work of debt reduction back to Capitol Hill, calling on lawmakers to reach "a final agreement on a plan to reduce the deficit" before the Treasury breaches the $14.3 trillion legal limit on borrowing in early July.

Last month, Carnival announced that it would begin sailing year-round from New York beginning in 2012. Prior to that, Baltimore was the cruise line's northernmost year-round port.
Still, the fact Romney thought he could play the Harvard card again suggests that he really will say anything to get elected. Or that it's Romney, not Obama (as some Republicans have said), who gets in trouble when he departs from the teleprompter. Or possibly that he has bottomless contempt for the voters.
When I reviewed the restaurant again two years ago, it seemed that the food had fallen into a crater; prices were up, cooking was sloppy and the place needed a face-lift. Owners Joseph Manzare and Mary Klingbeil seemed to have split their loyalties, opening, and closing, Mucca in Glen Ellen and Globe in Venice Beach. Last year, they opened two more restaurants closer to home: Zuppa and Tres Agaves, both in San Francisco.

I received a complaint about my texting 911 story. One example mentioned was how texting 911 could be beneficial is if a man was trying to break into a woman's home she could text 911 from the closet rather than call and give up her location. A viewer wasn't happy with this example. She e-mailed to say it smacked of sexism. She believes "specifying a woman as helpless and vulnerable reinforces stereotypes better left in the dustbin of history." I don't think my example came off as sexist. I apologize if some took it that way. It wasn't my intent.

The only miracle going on here is a marketing one. A treasure-trove of tunes by the Gershwin boys has been repurposed into a wobbly jukebox musical, with a hot-off-the-press book by Joe DiPietro ("Memphis") that's inspired by material by Guy Bolton and P.G. Wodehouse. That's the duo who wrote the book for "Oh, Kay!," the frolicsome 1926 Gershwin relic in which Broderick's character, the Jazz Age aristocrat Jimmy Winter, finds himself in a vaguely similar romantic jumble with a sexy fugitive bootlegger who's storing hooch at his Long Island estate.
Richard Clark, then the head of consumer protection and safety at the California Public Utilities Commission, criticized the spikings at a federal hearing in March as a "wrong-headed approach to safety," and federal officials said PG&E had misinterpreted the law - that such spikes were not needed to maintain a pipe's legal pressure cap.

I can't believe it has been 25 years. Sarah, Rachel and Josh were all under 5 when you left us, so while they got to meet you, they never got a chance to relish in your wit, your wisdom and your can-do spirit. And you never had a chance to see them grow into competent, compassionate and truly decent adults.
She could sing Sam Cooke with the grit of a soul shouter, and Gershwin with the grace of a jazz chanteuse. Acoustic folk, standards and show tunes, rock ’n’ roll and glossy chart-topping pop — she could handle it all. Yet she was never more commanding than when she sang her own genre-straddling compositions.

State competitiveness was a common thread at the opening of the ceremony, where Porter addressed the governors about how to improve competition in their states.
Yep, these are the things that I demand. I probably can find a lot of my friends who will demand many of these same things, and they could add more to customize their lists. Should we form a group and march for these demands? Make some signs? We can get angry that we don't have just what we want - RIGHT NOW - and decide that it's someone else's fault, and they had better give us what we want. RIGHT NOW. Or else.
In his 34-year career at Honeywell — known as Honeywell International Inc. since its acquisition in 1999 by AlliedSignal Inc. — Spencer rose from an aeronautical engineer to the company's chief executive from 1974 to 1987.

Another strong running back, another test for the Browns' run defense.
Many members of Congress in addition to Kaptur have accepted campaign donations from PMA, whose Washington, D.C., offices were raided by the FBI last year as part of an influence-peddling investigation. The firm disbanded after the raid. Over the years, it gave Kaptur's campaign $43,500, according to records analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, although it is far from her largest career donor. The lobbying company began giving to Kaptur in 2006, after she joined the defense spending subcommittee.
The Old Place: The Old Place roadhouse in Cornell in the Santa Monica Mountains has been grilling steaks for decades now. In fact, at one time steak was about the only thing on the menu. But when Morgan Runyon took over the old place after his father, cowboy actor Tom Runyon, died, he made some changes. Though most everything is still grilled over an oak fire, he greatly expanded the menu (and also hired a real chef). The oak-grilled Black Angus sirloin is still one of the best steak deals around at $19 — and that includes mixed green salad and a hefty baked potato. At that price, the steak isn't prime (just as it isn't at the Santa Maria steakhouses in the Central Coast). That red oak fire, though, gives the steaks a beautiful smoky edge. If you want to upgrade, consider the bone-in rib-eye that's almost always available. At 27 ounces, the $42 steak is big enough to feed two. Have it with a red from one of the Malibu wineries featured. Add in the old cowboy atmosphere, with tall-sided wooden booths, sassy waitresses and the star-studded sky overhead, and it's a steal. Groups of eight or more can reserve the long table in the original Cornell post office, which is, oh, about 127 years old now. Live music on the weekends too.

With 160 million doses available nationally, there shouldn’t be any shortage of the vaccines this year, Skinner said. The H1N1 virus — also known as swine flu — is one of three viruses included in this year’s flu vaccine, so one shot covers all, authorities said. H1N1 claimed 12,270 lives in the United States since April 2009, according to the CDC. In New Jersey, 37 adults and five children died of H1N1 last year, according to state health department spokeswoman Dawn Thomas.

Mike Vaccaro, New York Post: "He's been up and down and over and out, time and again, yet now, after this, after these two improbable championships, there is little question that whenever Coughlin decides he is done - and that will be entirely his decision now, make no mistake - he will take the passing lane to Canton, to the Hall of Fame, to a bronze bust and immortality.

And then the soldiers came. The solitude of Gethsemane was replaced by public exhibition. Crowds gathered again. The arrest and trial ensued. The beatings, the Via Dolorosa and the cruel Roman cross followed.

Was the animosity that saturated the atmosphere so dense that it stifled his breath? One can only imagine.
As a filmmaker, Donzelli deploys a heady, headlong style that recalls some early French New Wave (lots of running across city streets, lots of exuberant music, fast cuts, interior monologues and voice-over), but it never comes across as precious, or predictable.

A: I'm careful talking about partnerships between teachers and parents. Teachers see good parents as those who read to their kids and come to meetings. I think we need to look at why a parent won't come to a school. Why not say to the parent that we see you as a valuable partner? Tell me the assets of your child. Perhaps some parents have had bad experiences in schools. We can create a safe place to meet them, like a library or their homes.
We're almost at the end of our time in Europe, which has been a lot this year. It's been crazy with all of the travel but we've definitely been covering a lot of ground. They've been going really well. It's always interesting playing festivals because they're either well-organized, curated events or they're with bands you've never heard of, so that can be entertaining.

He spends the winter -- when he’s not pitching somewhere in Latin America -- in Oswego.
