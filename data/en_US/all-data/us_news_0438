They have no choice but to be trusting because, with limited understanding, and limited abilities to communicate, they, like Blanche DuBois in “A Streetcar Named Desire,” always depend on the kindness of strangers. Judging by Jon’s experience, they almost always receive it.

You might expect politics in affluent Orange to be a genteel endeavor. You'd be wrong. Incumbent Kathy Urdang Mulcahy, 56, won a fourth term in 2007, and the angry tone of that campaign still echoes on council. One of her loudest critics, first-term Councilman Edward J. Bonk, promises a "new perspective" as mayor. An energy executive and the husband of a former City Hall employee, Bonk, 60, would certainly deliver on that, but the new tone might not be an improvement, given his acidic take on almost everything Mulcahy -- usually with support from council -- has done.

Whatever the elements, Cronenberg has made a good movie from them, with outstanding performances by Michael Fassbender and Viggo Mortensen.
However, this move is by no means permanent because the Giants know Diehl's versatility means he can move back outside at a moment's notice.

Kevin Boothe, who agreed to a two-year contract this week, also provides flexibility.

Sustaining the success at Arlington Woods will require a commitment to maintaining the sense of urgency that has enveloped the school for the past two years. That's not an easy chore in a school frequently confronted with energy-sapping emergencies. Additionally, it will rely on the school dodging looming budget cuts that could eliminate positions that have been crucial to its success. And, leaders at the school say, to further improve, they need education reforms that would allow them to more easily remove poorly performing teachers and keep top teachers, regardless of seniority.

We are artists, we humans. Even those of us who are poor artists - by which I mean me - still long to express ourselves artistically. Every hymn, every stained glass window, every prayer in the Book of Common Prayer is the result of someone giving artistic expression to their faith. But the desire to worship artistically goes beyond what someone has done in the past. We participate in the present. When I raise my hands in worship it's a spontaneous response to what I'm feeling in that moment, but it's also, really, a way of embodying my worship. Less spontaneously, but just as meaningful to me, I lift my hands at the end of the service as the pastor gives the blessing. It's an embodied way of expressing my openness (and need) to receive a blessing.

Part of the social and cultural reality behind the tea party-GOP establishment split has been the sheer fact that tea partiers live in non-D.C. America. The establishment came from America, but hasn't lived there in a long time.

Still, Las Vegas oddsmakers have plenty of reason to tab the Lakers only as the fifth favorite to win the NBA championship. Lakers forward Metta World Peace will continue to serve a seven-game suspension for his elbow last week to the head of Okahoma City guard James Harden. Barnes currently nurses a sprained right ankle that he described as "sore." The Lakers' bench remains fourth to last in the league in efficiency.

Using the well documented notion of institutional racial bias in the legal system, this implicates the court's claim that pit bulls are "inherently violent."

"The Dressmaker" has all the required girlie-tropes. All the young girls worth knowing wear their hair carelessly unpinned; I suppose it shows their willingness to cut loose and party down, no matter what the century. Their love interests have blue eyes and unkempt beards. The young protagonist, Tess, notices a handsome young sailor: "His hair was unruly, but swept aside with careless confidence," and his eyes were "indeed as blue as the sea."

The airfare of my dreams was a Valentine's Day special open to anyone: $599 round-trip from L.A. to continent-straddling Istanbul, including tax and fees. It required a companion fare (which meant I had to find someone to go with) and traveling in February.

The Flyers are atop the Suburban West with postseason dreams dancing in their heads because they have a defense that can get key stops despite the turnovers.
But it was the five players Scott had on the floor early in the fourth quarter that became the story of their latest loss, a 101-98 setback to the Washington Wizards.

In the case of this plant, looking at its deep, narrow cup that unfurls into a floppy roof with a cylindrical spadix inside, reaching almost to the roof, I can imagine the scene. To an imaginative plant lover long ago, the oblong interior structure brought to mind the minister “Jack,” while the leafy shelter resembled an old-fashioned pulpit.
And does Christie really want to be known as the guy who chose casinos and shopping (rather than, say, genetic engineering) as New Jersey’s future?

The partnership has worked across multiple community sectors, designing projects that provide resources to meet their needs and relevant education opportunities for them and their communities to learn more about the science of climate change and the regional impacts that affect our quality of life.

The 2007 team had Oden to rebound and clean up defensive mistakes. "You usually talk about teams without a lot of talent playing good defense," Purdue's Matt Painter said of the 2011 Buckeyes.

The new MAC Tournament format, however, doesn't. With its perks to the powerful and its uneven playing field, it has more in common with the BCS than the NCAA Tournament.
This is all terrific stuff, vivid and honest, which is what happens when writers enter their discomfort zones. And yet, what strikes me most is how, not unlike the city it describes, such material reveals itself to us in pieces — which are another metaphor. In that regard, it seems oddly fitting that the most comprehensive literary response to the riots remains Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992," a theater piece, written and performed by an outsider who channels the cacophony of voices at the city's heart.
Mo Williams hit seven 3-pointers and scored a career-high 44 points in that victory. On Tuesday, Williams missed 13 of 17 shots and scored only 14 points, but hit a 3-pointer with 6.6 seconds left to give Cleveland an 85-83 lead.

In early December, lawsuits challenging the initiative were filed in King and Cowlitz counties. Final rulings on those challenges are pending. The key issue in the litigation appears to be whether I-1183 conforms to the single-subject rule when the provisions deal with the same general subject.

Big shock.

At the film's start, life is lovey-dovey for Tom and Violet. Soon after Tom cutely pops the question, things fall apart thanks to a string of unexpected events. A rushed wedding between Violet's quirky sister Suzie ("Community's" Alison Brie) and Tom's crass chef buddy Alex (a scene-stealing Chris Pratt of "Parks and Recreation"), along with a postdoc gig for Violet at the University of Michigan put engagement plans on ice. Their move to Michigan chills their relationship, with Tom quietly sacrificing his career so Violet can pursue her academic dream. After a long search, Tom lands an unfulfilling job at a deli, while Violet lands the affections of her erudite professor (Rhys Ifans).

In the early 1900s, at a time when most waterfront cities had ports and industrial plants, a crusading editor named W.L. Straub pressed this city to make its waterfront a public park. Today, 100 years later, St. Petersburg has the third-largest downtown waterfront park in North America, behind only Chicago and Vancouver. A spiky skyline has taken shape with six new condo towers rising in the past decade alone. So, with so many new skyscrapers and such varied architectural styles, did we do a good job of framing the unique waterfront park that Straub and other city pioneers left us?

OTIS THORPE: It's not his fault. And it is his fault. That's about all you can say. Some players don't jibe with their coaches. Otis didn't make it any better with his scowling, uninterested appearance on the court. And he was awful in the second half of the playoff series.

We're a pushover for any place with 80 wines by the glass and two dozen wine flights; it's not a long list. But Metrovino's vast vinicultural array is set against a menu of rampaging flavors, the kind of approach that perches a school of smoked trout atop beer-braised pork belly and lets the two salty richnesses fight it out. Metrovino's ideas of edible intensity are similarly expressed in pungent Louisiana grilled shrimp atop a muscular risotto, and brown sugar crème brulée topped by whipped cream spiked with pear bits. And with vast windows onto Pearl parkland, the people-watching is as lively as the cuisine.

Twenty years ago, I was thrilled to stand in a line that wrapped around the B&O warehouse in the hope that I'd be able to purchase a standing room only ticket to see the Baltimore Orioles play at Camden Yards.

We put a variety of dishes to the test recently and fell in love with the excellent crab rangoon ($4.95 for eight). The simple but satisfying contrast of crisply fried wonton and creamy-rich interior only becomes more addictive when drizzled with Dragon’s house-made sweet-and-sour sauce.

The United States is among the few modern economies in the world that still circulate such a low-denomination paper currency. Today's dollar buys about as much as a quarter did in the 1970s. In Canada, the lowest paper currency is the $5 bill, and in Japan it's the 5 yen ($12). And yet, year after year, the U.S. government churns out billions of $1 bills to replace the billions of worn-out dollars that are shredded and dumped in landfills -- at your expense. Dollar coins, meanwhile, are virtually indestructible, fully recyclable, and have a lifespan of 30 or more years. It's simply a better, more efficient product.
From that point on, I was all about registering online. I started going on my friend's registries to see what they asked for. For the big-ticket items like a breast pump and stroller, I started reading online reviews. For bottles and diapers, I began asking friends and family what worked for them. And that's how I built my registries: 100 percent word-of-mouth.
If the possible salvation of Android tablets is demonstrated by CES' premium tablets, the destruction of the platform is represented by damned-near all of the rest of them at the show. What lessons did tablet manufacturers learn from the beatings they received in 2010 and 2011? Mostly that they can't compete with Apple by selling a slightly-inferior tablet for the same price as the iPad.

øNot to be outdone, consider Yak Films. Another global company yes, but this time formed and run by three hip 20-somethings (or is it Hip Hop? There I go, dating myself.) The three friends travel the world filming cutting-edge dance and music scenes, then posting them on YouTube. Haven't heard seen their stuff? Don't worry, others have . . . millions of others Google "Heroes of Dance." That is why the likes of Adidas and Red Bull hire these guys to produce videos for them.
Christina Riccetti"The Brothers Size," featuring Bobby Bermea (from left), Damian Thompson and Brian Demar Jones, digs deepest and hits hardest of Tarell Alvin McCraney's "The Brother/Sister Plays."“The Brother/Sister Plays,” the colorful trilogy by acclaimed young dramatist Tarell Alvin McCraney, currently being staged by Portland Playhouse, has a handful of recurring motifs. For instance, each play begins with breath -- sharp, pronounced exhalations -- and song. Each includes references to the heat, the rain, the storms that almost can become shadowy characters in their own right amid the Louisiana bayou setting. And central in some way to each of the three loosely connected stories is the combination, oddly enough, of sleeplessness and dreams.
"In my opinion, there has been nobody bigger when it comes to San Diego sports," said U-T San Diego Publisher Doug Manchester, a close friend of Seau's. "… It's a sad day for San Diego. He was full of life. He was never down. The fact is, he was larger than life."
