Ozzie Guillen had no managerial experience when he took over the White Sox in 2004; a year later they were world champions. Mike Scioscia did much the same at Anaheim a few years earlier. Joe Girardi had immediate success as a rookie manager at Florida in 2007, then replaced the iconic Joe Torre as the Yankees' manager in 2008; they won a World Series in 2009.

I've been doing this all my life. The first time I started preaching I was 4. When I was 9, I was ordained by the Church of God in Christ. I started in civil rights when I was 12. I became director for Operation Breadbasket under William Jones and Jesse Jackson when I was 13 years old. People had never heard of me until I was late 20s or early 30s. So I sure didn't do it for fame. Who knew what you were doing at 13? I was a kid, so I grew up in the movement. One of the reasons Michael Jackson and I got along and I ended up doing the eulogy at his memorial is we used to talk about how neither one of us had a childhood. He grew up onstage; I grew up behind the pulpit.

This two-disc collection chronicles the solo years of David Sylvian, who rose to fame as the dashing yet arty young front man of U.K. New Wavers Japan. It begins with a remix of "Ghosts," his old band's biggest hit, which broods as artfully as David Bowie ever did.

Q. I work in the Deloitte building at the corner of Walnut and Memorial Drive in the city. My office overlooks the intersection on Memorial. Last month, there was a huge collision between an eastbound car that had probably violated the red light and pulled into the intersection where it was T-boned. I suspect the driver was seriously injured. There have been many such accidents at this intersection. The cause is the traffic light on the east side of the intersection near the cathedral. It turns green before the near light that drivers face on Walnut just before the southbound Memorial Drive intersection. It turns green almost five seconds before the first light, and inattentive drivers pull out thinking they have a green light. Either the city or state should change that so both lights turn green at the same time. There is no need to stagger the lights. If you can get that fixed you will save people from further injury.

Equally important are the problems China seems to be running into at home.

And believe me, I talk to him often enough to know that I'm not out of line. And I would never disrespect the man. I think he's a genius, and he's given me my whole life. He's done so much great work that there's no need for him to feel vulnerable about one film. But when you drop the ball you drop the ball."

øThe politics are very simple: Coal is the conventional fossil fuel that releases the most carbon dioxide, pound-for-pound, compared to oil or natural gas. Efforts to get across to the public that emissions of such greenhouse gasses inevitably lead to global warming, a position repeated recently by the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in a series of 2010 reports, increases public support for further regulating the stuff, almost certainly raising the cost of doing business for coal mine operators.

I saw another couple in the same situation recently and it really got to me how subservient and weak she looked as she scurried to keep up. We have been married a long time. I don't guess anything is going to change after all this time, but I feel uncared for and unloved when he goes off and leaves me trailing behind. Talking (arguing) has done no good. Any advice?
Now -- in this brief interlude between March rain and June heat -- is the best time to visit. Their views are not yet hazy with summer smog. The mud has dried along their steep trails, yet creeks still trickle like long cords of silver. And atop each peak are a few favorite wildflowers and gentle breezes.

Cardinals first baseman Craig, who had suffered a fractured right kneecap when, as a right fielder, he slid into a railing here last May, showed no fear as he got to the rail in front of the dugout. He reached well over that rail to snatch Martinez's foul pop.

But, then again, in a further twist that differentiates them from most other line cooks, French Laundry cooks don't taste their completed dishes. Keller explained that if the cooks taste each component, and know that the flavor profiles work, the finished product will also work. On top of an ever-changing menu, if an ingredient doesn't look up to snuff when it comes in, Hollingsworth will swap it out for something better. The line cooks must not only be skilled enough to juggle new dishes every day but also be able to change their dishes on the fly.

"She can do that with her right and her left," Bruno said. "She's curved in a lot of corners for us."
A key factor was a 38 percent rise in fuel costs during the period, Heimlich said.
One of Feigen's sources calls that an "outright lie" by Stern.

The move represents the latest salvo launched at Indianapolis-based SynCare. As first reported by the Post-Dispatch last week, SynCare missed payroll and laid off 29 staffers working out of its Ballwin office.

Of course, many Americans who cite Christianity to justify their economic conservatism may not have read the Bible. In that sense, religion has become more of a superficial brand rather than a distinct catechism, and brands can be easily manipulated by demagogues. To know that is to read the Sermon on the Mount and then marvel at how anyone still justifies right-wing beliefs by invoking Jesus.
As haute couture undergoes the process of revival once more, its insular and quintessentially Parisian nature is changing. To wit, many of today's practitioners are not French. Italian designer Giambattista Valli debuted just last year, joining Giorgio Armani, which launched couture label Armani Privé in 2005, and Versace, which began in 1989 as part of the Milanese contingent. And there's Lebanese designer Elie Saab, who does a robust business for his gowns. Perhaps it's only fitting for what appears to be couture's ever more global future.

Angela's condition, known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, affects some 3,000 newborns in the U.S. each year. With just one pumping chamber, or ventricle, instead of the usual two, the babies can't deliver sufficient levels of oxygen to their organs and extremities, compromising their development and causing them to turn blue and suffer from a lack of energy. Without a surgical repair, says Dr. Breuer, 70% of them die before their first birthday.
“It is mathematical snake oil,” says Stanford mathematics professor Keith Devlin, who chafes that, despite his perfect blood pressure and cholesterol numbers, his intensive routine of competitive bicycling and his 32-inch waist, his BMI number identifies him as “overweight,” (defined as falling between 25 and 29.9), prompting his physician to nudge him to exercise more and eat less.

Culturally, beatniks were becoming mods, rock 'n' roll was taking hold, and the move from stockings to pantyhose -- and eventual bra-burning -- all influenced mid-'60s fashion. It will all probably mean a lot to upwardly mobile Peggy Olson, who started off wearing matronly clothes when she was Don Draper's secretary but is a feminist at heart, says Stoddart, who wrote "Analyzing Mad Men: Critical Essays on the Television Series."
Minoso just turned 89. He's still a fixture at Sox games. It's not clear he'll get another shot at Cooperstown. But if he ever does get the esteem he enjoyed at the Frolik dinner table so long ago, let's hope that unlike Santo, he's still around to hear the cheers.

Correia lacks Strasburg's power and instead kept the Pirates in it with his precision. He cruised through the first five innings but wobbled just long enough in the sixth to give up the lead.
In Mary's words: "It was encased in a clear-plastic box and had a roadrunner design imprinted on it. It came back and forth in the family, always disguised in many ways and always with everyone forgetting it was around. Finally after 30 years of the soap going back and forth, I turned it into a Christmas ornament with a note that it must stay as an ornament. My daughter-in-law still has it."
Raonic won at San Jose last week and is 15-1 in match play this year. Ranked 35th in the world, the ATP World Tour's first multiple winner this season will try to win his third title Sunday against Austrian Jurgen Melzer, a 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 winner over No. 3 seed Radek Stepanek.

Yet when Lincecum left the field Monday with his first win of the 2012 season, it didn't matter how difficult the outing looked at times. He declared it a starting point. Almost any pitcher would. They rarely talk about their ERAs, considered a pedestrian measure in sabermetric circles, much less WHIP, FIP, BABIP or the especially esoteric WAR.
Come summer, expect to see the Skittles shades on hot pants. And, Moellering says, look for prints, in floral and geometric patterns, on denim this fall.
Though she stuck it out the entire meeting and participated fully in the discussion, she couldn't cast a vote on the most divisive issue of the night, whether to negotiate contract changes with district employees. She clearly wanted the district to do so, but by law she had to be physically present for her vote to count. An Internet hook-up didn't count.
Orfield, 63, entered the sound-research field fairly early, but not until after he figured out what he didn't want to do: work for anyone other than himself.
Chapin lived in Liberty with her husband, Timothy Finn, The Star’s pop music critic, and their two daughters, Brenna, 16, and Maren, 14.

Sammons, who moved to the Buford area about 30 years ago from Los Angeles to get away from the busy city life, bought the trading post on Jan. 31, 1992. He plans to retire from his unofficial title as "mayor" and write a book about his experiences in Buford, he said.
Glasgow, Ky., was sentenced today to seven years in prison for an October 2009 plot to steal a gas station's cash as an employee deposited it at a bank.
Beyond the local issues of total-run volume and pension payments, the significance of firefighter and paramedic staffing levels has been documented over the last 30 years. Repeatedly, studies from major universities and national public safety organizations have demonstrated the empirical evidence against reducing first responders. Eliminating personnel has been directly linked to the loss of lives, increased financial strain to compensate for overtime and influxes in workplace injuries, as well as criminal and civil litigation against municipalities for failing to protect their citizens adequately. The facts are painfully clear. When emergency services staffing is cut, the public suffers.

To qualify for the government’s incentive funding, hospitals must meet “meaningful use” criteria, a set of regulations that was updated in July by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The guidelines define “meaningful use” objectives that providers must meet. One regulation identifies the technical capabilities required for certified EHR technology.

Ultimately, this enchanting tale is a Zen analogue to the story of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus transforms biblical vengeance into a Christian's duty to "turn the other cheek." The harsh treatment he has received for 40 years, and his willingness to forgive all those who have done him harm, makes Thich Nhat Hanh the spiritual heir of, coincidentally, a Zen legend and a good Christian's first maxim.

But Batch hasn't saved Dixon from typical rookie duties: Toting bags and shoulder pads, bringing sunflower seeds for the quarterbacks and fetching their breakfast from a downtown restaurant on Saturday mornings. Batch and Roethlisberger are "licking their chops," Dixon said, especially since Dixon is Roethlisberger's first rookie to break in.
In my position, I do a little bit of everything, which includes traveling with the team to Spring Training and for a minimum of two regular season road trips, writing game notes, assisting with the production of the media guide, coordinating features for Comcast SportsNet CA's "All A's" show and assisting players with their charitable work. When the team is in town during the season, our typical day begins at 9:30 a.m. and concludes about an hour after the last out of the game, and during the off-season we work more of a typical 9-5 schedule.

Long, of course, is more than that. Freshmen do not dominate the area running scene. They don't challenge for the large-schools state title. They don't set the meet record in the season's first -- and biggest -- race. Long did all of those things, including obliterate the meet record at the season-opening Forest Park Cross Country Festival where, in her first varsity race, she ran the area's fastest 3,000-meter time of the season, 18:00.
Most of the events for the conference are expected to take place in the Tower Grove and South Grand Avenue neighborhoods. Organizers did not rule out taking over downtown's Kiener Plaza, where the group kept camp about two months last year.

This Advent, I am practicing ways that I can hear the sounds of Advent differently. There's too much noise in our world, and I think the church ought to practicing turning the volume down a bit if we really want people to hear our message. I pray for the imagination to see Christ being born in this world in ways that I might have otherwise missed. If we want something in us to change this Christmas, then a good place to begin is turning down the volume on the Christmas megamachine.

"Everyone, from consumers to regulators, knows that they are different," he said.
It was obvious the long-implied contract between America's biggest companies and its upwardly mobile work force was broken. From here, boom or bust, nobody could expect to stay in one place for long, except for maybe Challenger.
It's true that anyone can go to the Johnson County website at JoCoGov.org, navigate to its Index of Official Records, look up the annotated agendas and even watch online video of the meeting. But I also agree with one caller Friday who said he looks to The Kansas City Star to do a lot of that work for him:
1/4 cup minced fresh sage, plus 12 whole leaves
It's possible to overdo the richness if you order carelessly. So we had the bone marrow, the pork belly and the tendon and tongue dishes on separate visits. All together in the same evening, it would feel like four sticks of butter washed down with a pint of heavy cream.
Huffman recounted driving up a long winding driveway, past a guard, to Mellon’s home in Virginia horse country.

I look forward to that time as a time at home where I can be with my family more. But I would love to see us on top of the East. Coaching the thing, that's not a goal of mine at all."
Clever enough to have thought about asking for — and receiving — some 1,200 pairs of orphaned eyeglasses at two unclaimed baggage facilities run by the airlines in Alabama. And clever enough to have talked up the Lions long ago to an assistant principal at McEachern High School, where Couey was working as a plumber for the Cobb County School system after spending 20 years as a welder at Lockheed.
"It used to be more like a folk rock kind of thing, and now we're getting more into some electronica and bringing some jazz influence into the folk genre," said Zucker, who is a University of Michigan English major. "So we're kind of molding this traditional genre based around storytelling and that kind of lyrical component, and we're shaping it into something that kind of fuses genres. We're trying to get a little bit more out there with our sound and make it more ambient and dense in terms of orchestrations."
Had Glover met the president, she said: "I would tell him to try to do something to keep the water from coming in all the houses. Divert the water somewhere. Or just knock all these houses down and make a parking lot."
The county's plan is hazy. In January, staff and consultants will survey residents to suss out what's wrong and what's right in Aloha. Eventually, staff will create a plan for redeveloping the community, but right now, no money is available to implement any plan the county creates. In the meantime, Aloha is changing -- with or without concrete plans.

The Anglican musical repertoire is largely written for divided choir - cantoris (on the cantor's side of the altar) and decani (on the dean's side) - and much of the music took advantage of that split. As in an English cathedral, the "congregation" sat in those choir stalls that weren't occupied by singers.
For Schenk, that's illustrated in his Lamb Skewers with Mint Mojo. Like many South American and Caribbean skewers, the lamb soaks in a simple marinade of honey, vinegar and oil for at least two hours, allowing it to absorb flavor and tenderize the meat.

Q: Would you please direct me to the website that would provide a list of native plants and trees that would grow well in the soil of our El Dorado Hills home? It would be such a helpful option available to home gardeners.
For such a busy, crazy place, the service is low key and friendly. The staff knows the menu and is able to shout out recommendations. If you order as much food as I always do, the waiters work out the progression of dishes, ensuring that the table is never overloaded with plates. You're on your own in pacing how much you put away.
"The refreshment was so well-received that about midmorning, one of the voters decided to go through the line again," E. Guy Jewell reported, in a story untroubled by names or dates.

The Blunks had to ask their son, Michael, for a loan that they haven't been able to repay. It worries them because they know that making the loan was a sacrifice for their son and daughter-in-law. According to Rutgers, 60 percent of the unemployed have borrowed money from family or friends.
In Shreveport, Michael Nash, 38, watched his son play in a T-ball game, describing the scene as "good old conservative values." He said he would vote for Santorum even though he expected Romney would win the nomination.

In Portland, for example, half of all new hires in the past year have been women or minorities, says Yvonne Deckard, human resources director. But it takes a while for change to reach the highest ranks, she says. “You’re not going to ask all your white males to resign,” she says. “When you have an opportunity, you have to take advantage of those opportunities.”

I am almost embarrassed to say in public how much I enjoy that last one.
In San Jose, the gleaming core of downtown stands relatively unscathed. But an older industrial area outside the downtown has fared less well. Some of its buildings were of "tilt-up" construction, a cheap and quick way of creating a large working space by propping up walls and then securing them with a massive roof. It's a kind of construction similar to the building of a house of cards. And that's exactly the way some of those structures respond to the quake.
The stepmom has 30 days to notify the court to request a hearing contesting the restraining order, and a hearing would have to be scheduled within 5 days of her notice.

Known today for its top-notch public schools, this well-heeled city survived annexation efforts in the early 1900s and today thrives with a great quality of life and as a place to raise a family.
The two other appellate judges who upheld the jury award noted that the diocese did not argue the $5 million award was excessive. The ruling also found that allegations were not refuted that former officials of the diocese in the 1970s and 1980s ignored evidence that Kownacki was a pedophile and reassigned him to parishes without warning parishioners.

Mike Dittoe, spokesman for House Speaker William G. Batchelder, said "all options are on the table" and indicated that a decision would be coming in the next day or two.

I was still in diapers when Hawaii became a state in August 1959. But in our mutual (relative) maturity, we’ve become lifelong friends. It was the first place I ever took a vacation on my own, the first place I vacationed with my future wife, the collection of islands I return to at least once a year for a working trip that is the most blissfully relaxing of anything I do all year.

This industry's business model is based on trapping people in a cycle of debt. In exchange for a postdated check for, say, $300, borrowers get $255 in cash. When the loan is due, many can't pay it off. So they go across the street to another lender and pay another $45 fee, just to borrow the same $255 and pay off the first loan. This can go on and on.
In some cases, the chief didn't react strongly or quickly enough when inappropriate use of force was used during police stops, some of which were captured on videotape.

"Unwind," reads a message spotlighted on the entry wall of Bank, the bistro-bar tucked off the lobby in Napa's Westin Verasa. That gimmick, plus the color-coordinated bar and furniture, sleek stone columns, jazz and bartender in classic black vest and black shirt, might suggest a cookie-cutter corporate operation for the plush hotel that opened next door to Oxbow Public Market in 2008.

The Republican primary is a two-stage process, in which voters state their preferences for presidential candidates in a nonbinding "beauty contest" and then vote directly for delegates pledged to contenders. Santorum, who failed to file full slates in several congressional districts, is eligible for only 44 of the state's 54 delegates.
Fran Fraschilla, ESPN.com (via Salt Lake Tribune): "He's the old-fashioned prototypical international player that we remember when he first started coming into the league. What we call the face-up four or five man. The guy that plays on the 3-point line, can stretch the defense with his shooting. He's crafty inside but he's not a physical player yet. He's really one of those pick-and-pop four or five man. A lot of international experience for a young player … very successful — actually may have been drafted higher if he were in the draft last year."
"Together we will secure our border and get our nation back," Pam Stephenson, director of the Arizona Tea Party, told a crowd of more than 5,000 people gathered at Tempe Diablo Stadium.

Hammond said to expect more books from Newt Gingrich — he has written about two dozen — and videos from the couple. Gingrich also will return to the paid speaking circuit, on which he commanded $60,000 per speech before his presidential run. But Hammond said he does not expect a return to the five- or six-day-a-week schedule of the past. After all, Gingrich is 68; when he left Congress, he was 55.

Need hairstyle ideas for your wedding? We love the braided bun that Kerastase hair stylist Brandon Yamamoto created for the Monique Lhuillier Fall 2012 bridal show. "Monique's collection is very springy, young and flirty, so we went with a French braid so that it was textured and young looking, but clean at the same time," says Yamamoto. Here's how to get the look in five easy steps:
In the midst of a three-game losing streak, the Portland Timbers take on the defending MLS Cup champion Los Angeles Galaxy Saturday night at the Home Depot Center (7:30 p.m., KPDX).
The Blazers’ offense was disjointed and ineffective for most of the night, committing 18 turnovers and shooting just 40.5 percent, including 27.8 percent from three-point range. Coach Nate McMillan said his team stopped feeding the ball to Aldridge in the post and tried to force the issue with a “run-and-gun” mentality.

The program has helped to prop up the housing market, but its health remains precarious. Foreclosures are expected to keep climbing. Soured loans will still weigh on banks. More homeowners are expected to go under water, meaning they owe their lender more than their home is worth.

Critics claim the Chesapeake Bay Restoration Fund was raided, but that's not really true — unless "raiders" customarily replace all the money they've taken. Whatever money was transferred out of the fund to shore up the operating budget was immediately restored through the capital budget. That kind of swap is not ideal, but it's reasonable given the economic downturn and the desire to avoid tax increases as long as possible.
Other vets in Royal Harbor don't see it that way.
- In Colorado, state Senate President Brandon Shaffer is challenging freshman Rep. Cory Gardner in the 4th District, which includes most of the state's conservative eastern plains. McCain carried the district with 56 percent of the vote. Bush won it with 64 percent.

"I think there is confusion," said Paul Keckley, health research chief for Deloitte, a major benefits consultant. "I found myself wondering how much they understood the Affordable Care Act.

One more win gets them to the Super Bowl, thanks to Brady's six scoring passes against Denver, tying the NFL record held by Daryle Lamonica and Steve Young. By halftime, Brady already had thrown for five touchdowns while Tebow had just three completions.

My guess is he goes with someone to boost him in the South, where Romney needs shoring up. My bet is either South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, to get the women's vote, or former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. At least he can talk to people.

With hundreds of Tequilas at the ready, it's no wonder Tommy's draws a crowd.
Christopher Hansen, a hedge-fund manager, would be the main money man for the arena. It's not been clear if he intends to buy the teams that come to Seattle, but the Times' report said "he also would buy a professional basketball team, and recruit a hockey team." The Maloofs have been insistent that they would not sell the Kings even if they move, which makes you wonder if the NBA-owned Hornets aren't a more natural target.
O'Connor's personal life threatened to overshadow her new music. Her tweets in January about seeking psychiatric help set off a round of potentially embarrassing stories, although O'Connor says medical professionals commended her for taking her needs public.

This week, the FDA proposed guidelines not for the livestock industry but for the pharmaceutical companies that provide farms and ranches with massive amounts of common antibiotics without prescriptions. The guidelines call on drug companies not to sell the drugs without a veterinarian's prescription or for "non-medical uses." Even if pharmaceutical companies were to comply, despite the considerable loss of sales, this would address only antibiotic use for growth and would not stem the use of the drugs to prevent illness. Because the same drugs are commonly used for both, it's hard to see how this would make a sizable dent in the problem.

"Honestly, we were squeezing as hard as we could over the last few years."
But just because Gianni is suddenly interested in women, just because he engages in desultory rooftop exercises to get into shape and even buys new clothes, that doesn't mean that women are necessarily interested in him. In fact, in this gentle world where everything is slightly askew, it might not mean anything at all.
"No matter how you slice it, that's real money that could help bring down our deficit. Most important: It's simply the right thing to do," he said in a statement.

"Chinese consumers love to be driven probably more than in any other market," said Ian Callum, global design director for Jaguar. "They love opulence, they love all the conveniences, they to love to show off." At the show, Mr. Callum debuted the company's XJ L Ultimate, a glittering stretch specimen with lacquer-black-and-polished-metal work tables in the rear cabin, twin integrated iPads, two business-class lounge seats (climate-controlled and massaging) in the back and a Champagne chiller with custom-designed flutes.

The daughter is found in Crab-a-rama, a seafood shack located, somewhat improbably, inside the convention center -- um, the airport. The thug who's been holding the girl is dispatched, pronto. Nate and the gang find out that the evil rich guy is also dying, and wants the heart for himself.
Apparently, it's not going to be boring, on the field or off, and you suspect that's exactly what athletic director Bill Moos had in mind.
The true but irrelevant point that the report talks up is this: Huge retirement plans like New York’s, which manage $110 billion for 700,000 families’ current or future retirement, can achieve economies of scale and other cost savings (e.g., lower investment fees) because of their sheer size.
If that general rule isn't followed, “It creates more congestion; it creates more hazards,” said Gabe Montoya, a California Highway Patrol officer and spokesman based in Irvine.

Japan, the only country to have experienced an atomic-bomb attack, has for decades played up its role as the victim of an unthinkable atrocity, while at the same time glossing over its invasions of China, Manchuria, and other countries in Asia. Revisionist textbooks in Japan have glossed over the massacre at Nanking and other atrocities the Japanese committed in Asia during World War II.

The campaign-as-warfare metaphor may seem sensible to those inside the hothouse. It may make sense if you think today's swing voters hunger for more combat, more harshness and more attack.
This week, it's Arizona Cardinals running back Beanie Wells. The former Akron Garfield and Ohio State star is a burly 6-2, 229 pounds, and he's used his brash style to run for 943 yards in 12 games this season. That's an average of 4.4 yards per carry, and it's helped him to score nine touchdowns for the resurgent Cardinals, who are 6-7.

The adjustment is with the new domed stadiums, where they have you a step below the court. When we did the first basketball games at Reliant Stadium in Houston (site of next week’s Final Four) in the 2008 regionals, they had us so submerged that we were at sneaker level. From where I was I couldn’t tell if the guy was shooting a 2 or a 3. I had to call it off the monitor.
New UCLA linebackers coach Jeff Ulbrich is pounding him on it, chanting, 'Get low, get low," to Kendricks in every drill, on every play.
• A proposal for an emergency expenditure of $49,700 for SAK Construction to install a protective lining on 400 feet of sewer pipe that the city found to be degraded by sewer gases. The discovery was made after the line was damaged and repaired by a Caltrans contractor that had been doing pile-driving work for an I-5 widening project in the San Juan Creek Road area. The money for the lining would come from capital-improvement funds for sewer replacement.

The e-mail Dincuff said Corcodilos sent to Patricia C. Scott, director of Fiscal Policy and Planning for the department, sometime in March, when the school board was in the process of crafting its 2012-13 school district budget, is the reason the board will be voting tonight, Monday, April 23, on a resolution stating “Corcodilos does not represent the Clinton Township Board of Education or any of its members or any administrators in any capacity whatsoever.”

Forward Carmelo Anthony said he didn't see Stoudemire after the game and didn't know what happened. But he admitted it's clearly the last thing the Knicks, down 0-2 in this first-round playoff series, need right now.
Part Korean pancake, part crepe; easy and versatile. For heartier appetites, fill the pancake with shredded, cooked chicken, pork, beef or seafood (or other vegetables, for that matter) or add some cooked protein to the batter. (Fish or seafood in small pieces could be added raw just before cooking; the pancake's cooking time allows these items to be cooked through.) Use older scallions with thick bulbs for this recipe; they have a more distinct oniony flavor.
And his efforts have inspired those fed up with the corruption that plagues daily life. Gaurav Bakshi, a 34-year-old who was running a social-development nonprofit, decided to join Mr. Hazare's campaign as a senior volunteer after a run-in with a bureaucrat who demanded a bribe in order for him to finalize adoption papers for his stepdaughter. He didn't pay the bribe and was assaulted, he said.

Again, feel free to call me a snob, but it’s not as if I don’t appreciate a good hot dog, burger or pretzel. Some of my favorite meals come from a truck. And it might be that you’ll be so drunk — like many were after the Phillies’ Opening Day loss — that you won’t be offended, as I was, at the insulting beer menus at Broad Street Bullies and Victory Beer Hall. At both places, the menus offer dozens of beers, with a list of their alcohol content . . . but nary a price. “Oh, all our beers range from $4 to $7,” said the bartender at Broad Street Bullies, only when I asked.

The image of the lone gunman is dated. During Vietnam, snipers were often sent on hunting missions far from friendly forces, Brink said. Today, however, the Army usually teams them up with conventional forces or places them in positions that can be supported by nearby friendly troops.

One of the few moments in "Last Days" that may elicit a smile is an early one when the addled hero, Blake, a fictional version of Nirvana's Kurt Cobain, puts a box of Rice Krispies back in the fridge and leaves a container of milk on the counter. But then Gus Van Sant's meditation on Cobain's death -- his third meditation on death after the baffling "Gerry" and the dark, ineffably moving "Elephant" -- isn't meant to amuse, or entertain. Mr. Van Sant and his star, Michael Pitt, together with the cinematographer Harris Savides, set out to do a somber, rigorously distanced study of a man drained of all resources, and slowly though inexorably approaching his end.
Firefighters and police officers packed a conference room yesterday inside the Student Union Building at New Jersey City University to tell members of the state Assembly Law and Public Safety Committee their departments desperately need more staff.

The performance was remarkable basically from start to finish. It was one of those nights when Springsteen -- arguably the most acclaimed live act in rock history -- actually managed to surpass his own legend. He was fiery, passionate and very much in control, working the crowd with the conviction and focus of a preacher in a revival tent.
As Spencer lay in a St. Joseph Mercy Hospital bed Sunday in Ypsilanti, slowly fighting back against a newly diagnosed automimmune neuromuscular disorder called myasthenia gravis, she became the 41st inductee into the Canton Hall of Fame during a ceremony at Summit on the Park.
