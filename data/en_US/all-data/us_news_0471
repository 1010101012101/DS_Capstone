Rather than switch schools, the Baldocks asked to stay in the Tigard-Tualatin district. Beaverton granted their wish.

Unlike antennas, spires are liked by record-keepers. It's a tradition that harkens to a time when the tallest buildings in many European cities were cathedrals. Groups such as the Council on Tall Buildings and Emporis, a building data provider in Germany, count spires when measuring the total height of a building, even if that spire happens to look exactly like an antenna.

There's no debating the need for a police training center. Portland police now must crisscross the metro Portland region and even travel out of state to get their annual review training accomplished. They do defensive tactics and scenario-based training at the Oregon National Guard's Camp Withycombe, about 12 miles away, and travel across Oregon for firearms training at several private gun clubs because the bureau can't reserve enough time at any one range to accommodate its nearly 1,000 officers

øIf it's assumed - and it's not confirmed - that every Western team supports the four-conference plan, then five Eastern votes would be needed to pass. Of course, one of the Eastern teams is the Winnipeg Jets, formerly known as the Atlanta Thrashers. It's their need to be regrouped with Western teams that is the genesis for realignment. Presumably, they support the four-conference concept. That means only four more Eastern votes would be needed for passage, and supporters of the four-conference seem to believe that the Philadelphia Flyers are now in their corner. Now it's down to three.

The edict Ayeroff got from Dylan's camp upon opening his song trove for the benefit of Amnesty International couldn't have been clearer. "My assignment was not to be a snob; it was to be creative and to let everybody do it who wants to do it," said Ayeroff, who also shepherded the John Lennon tribute album. "There is no judgment here. We wanted to hear what people could deliver. Miley has spent a lot of time dealing with gay issues, she's young, she has a voice and is coming into her own as a young adult. She's actually very bright, very articulate…. And her godmother is Dolly Parton — you can take it from there."

Meanwhile, Seattle (7-7) has won five of six to get back to .500, but needs plenty of help to complete its second-half charge and reach the postseason for a second straight season.

St. Margaret Mary parishioners have already begun taking steps to appeal Lennon’s decision not to reopen their church, filing appeal documents with the Vatican. There is no timetable on when the Vatican will rule on this appeal, though if the appeals of the other 12 churches are any indication, it could be a couple of years before we receive a final ruling. There is certainly no guarantee St. Margaret Mary will win its appeal, and parishioners have to accept that bitter reality.

The Northeast Portland high-tech consultant told The Oregonian last month that was fed up with what he sees as a violation of his civil liberties. On April 17 at about 5:35 p.m., he was on his way to catch a plane for a business trip to San Jose, Calif., when he chose not to go through one of the new security machines.

Brennan said he found that "ridiculous," and so he stripped off all his clothes to show that he didn't have a bomb.
"This transition of construction has been challenging," Brown said. "We're working around the contractors. We've maintained our capacity the whole time, and the dogs and staff and volunteers have been patient.

Posada's image was basically a head shot, unclothed except for the elegant hat. It took Diego Rivera to portray a full-length figure, put her in an elegant dresss and, by some accounts, to dub her "La Catrina." In the center of his 50-foot mural, Sueño de una tarde dominical en la Alameda Central ("Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in Alameda Park"), Catrina holds the 10-year-old Rivera's hand while Frida Kahlo in traditional Mexican dress stands behind them. None other than a dapper Posada himself stands to Catrina's left, offering her his arm. The symbolism — and this is but a fraction — is staggering.

What it means: First of all, Pollard stays where he probably belongs. With his intensity, toughness, confidence and bravado, the strong safety proved to be a perfect fit for the Ravens’ vaunted defense, and an ideal partner for the freewheeling Ed Reed. Pollard’s free agent signing last offseason was a little bit under the radar, but he quickly emerged as an impact player, and a well-respected locker room voice. By getting the 27-year-old locked up through the 2015 season, the Ravens added some necessary stability at the safety position. While they possess three young cornerbacks, the Ravens’ outlook at safety had been a little murky with both Pollard and Reed heading into the final years of their deals and reserves Tom Zbikowski and Haruki Nakamura having bolted in free agency. But now, the Ravens got Pollard locked up for longer and in doing so, they also were able to find the salary cap space to bring in his former Texans’ teammate, Jacoby Jones.

Booksellers conduct one of the mysterious, essential transactions of the business: "handselling." That's when a staffer thinks of the perfect book and gets it in a customer's hands. Booksellers can't snow customers, because they won't come back.

For Chaon, then, selling a few books in Naperville is good; hanging out with Chicago booksellers is better.

Mr. Slob's Christian party is one of those now key to a deal. Mr. Rutte's caretaker government is most likely to get support from the Liberal Democrats, or D66, the more progressive Green party, or Groenlinks, and Christenunie.

Statisticians and city supporters call the study flawed. Because it measures only cities, they argue, it unfairly equates tight-boundaried places such as St. Louis with far-more sprawling Sun Belt towns. And even then, they point out, a few neighborhoods with high crime rates end up tarring an entire city as unsafe. Still, such statistical nuances are easily lost on observers from elsewhere, making the whole region look bad.

The year's most misunderstood album is also one of its best and most political. "Watch the Throne" is not just a celebration of opulence. It's also a challenge to the poor and mistreated to stand up and take control of the American project. That the challenge came from two of the wealthiest men in popular entertainment shouldn't come as a surprise to fans of rap music (or Occupy Wall Street) -- upward social mobility has always been central to hip-hop's ideology. Thanks to Jay-Z, the imperative to hustle for every dime has rarely been articulated as well as it is here, and thanks to Kanye West and his stable of producers, the beats gleam like a Maserati fresh from the paint shop. Heart-stopping cut: "Murder to Excellence," on which Jay tells his audience, "When you see me, see you."
