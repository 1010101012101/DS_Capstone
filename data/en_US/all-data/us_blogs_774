I used some pretty papers (Denim, Poplin, and Tweed), wooden buttons (Boutique Fair), and alphabet stickers (Bitty Block) from the lovely Indigo Bleu collection by Pink Paislee that's on sale in the StopAndScrap Store.

There was much excitement in the house as it was The Wonoona Show weekend. Marilyn and her mum were fussing over what I thought was a cranky, ugly dog.
Dixon- Dixon gets a call from a label and tells Ade they got a meeting and a spot at a music festival. Dixon shows up to the meeting with Marilyn, sans Ade. Marilyn notices Ade’s absence and says she’s got a bad rep in the business. Dixon tries to convince her Ade’s changed and says that Ade’s not there because she’s sick. Because of the Vanessa incident, Dixon has to perform his and Ade’s set solo. After Dixon’s set, Marilyn offers Dixon, and only Dixon, a recording contract. Ade later comes by and Dixon lies about seeing Marilyn.
That didn’t work this time. In fact it might be time for me to clean up the long list as I didn’t understand half my suggestions. Bright ideas, I’ve discovered, often lose meaning if left stagnating too long.

"You're going to have a good birthday," he said. He meant well, but it felt like a stab to my heart. The trip was planned with his family last year, before we were serious, before he even knew when my birthday was.
Oh, lordy, lots at different times! Mac Wellman’s Crowbar by En Garde Arts in 1990 is as good as any. I’d been in NYC three whole days when my friend Dan called and asked if I wanted to be in the ensemble of a play he was stage managing. Looking back, I can’t believe I hesitated, even if only briefly. The production was a whole new world. I’d never heard of site-specific theater before, I’d never read or seen anything like Mac’s work, I’d never imagined exploring every nook and cranny of a former Broadway theater (the Victory, pre-New Victory). The production became a huge hit, with celebrities in the audience every night. I met wonderful folks, like Richard Caliban, Annie Hamburger, Jan Leslie Harding, Juliana Francis, Michael John Garces, Lou Moreno, Richard Sheinmel and Anita Durst. I got my Equity card. And it entirely changed the kind of work I wanted to do.
An hour after breakfast, strolling out toward the horse stable for a midmorning ride, she turned to me with a mischievous gleam and informed me that we would be "investigating the old farmhouse" just as soon as Grandpa headed into town for groceries. I took this about as well as someone who's been informed of impending oral surgery, but I also knew better than to resist her will or let her go alone. The last thing I wanted on this quiet weekend was an upset wife or--far less--an injured one, so I acquiesced.

After all pastors are “paid” to do the work aren’t we? Throw some money in the offering plate and they’ll get the job done. If they don’t, get rid of them and find someone who will. So, pastors burnout at a rate that is considerably higher than in other vocations.
Seriously, I have no idea. I don't think I'd be good at long life, I'd probably get all stabby and off someone. But, if I had to say something, I'd love to see (a) the world as culture and that kind of thing intrigues me. And (b) I love to see fashion changes. This is mostly because they crack me up! And besides that, imagine the shoe collection I could have...because you know I'm vain like that.
So with that in mind, I stepped on the scale today, one week later, and BOOM: no loss, no gain. Exactly the same as the week before. Even though I stuck to the same eating and exercised more.

But walking around the Marais today, I couldn't deny that it's officially fall. And I sort of liked it. It reminded me of being a college student in Boston: everyone was out strolling in their tweed blazers and Ray-Bans. Sitting at cafes with coffees and chocolats. Bundled up in chunky sweaters and swaddles in scarves. Or maybe I'm just sick of fighting things I can't control.

Of late, there has been a veritable explosion of sorts, in writing memory. In these times, we are really seeing the final passing away of that generation from West Bengal who not only had ancestral roots in East Bengal but had actually lived their, often right into their adulthood , as was the case for many later refugees. What they have also seen is the gradual loss of the signs of their distinctiveness in their future generations – distinctiveness that defined self-identities and attitudes. Few people of Barisal origin born in West Bengal have anything akin to the stereotypical Barishailya raag ( the innate short-temper of Barisal people). In West Bengal, hardly any post-partition generation of Dhaka-Bikrampur origin would self-identify oneself with that dash of brash pride that comes with the epithet of ‘Dhakaiya kutty’. The slow loss of the cultural peculiarities of these sons and daughters, and grandsons and granddaighters, of East Bengal, thrust upon West Bengal, has resulted in the writing of memoirs – memoirs of a way of life, memoirs of the loss of a way of life. These memoirs differ from the kinds which were produced earlier, post-partition, which often had the backdrop of recent loss, that one had not come to terms with. The present crop of writing is rich with the story of loss, that has been digested and reflected upon, in terms of the double loss in identity that they see right in front of their eyes, in their progeny. That makes this genre of literary exploration especially poignant as it is also the last gasp of a robust, secure and self-confident East Bengal in West Bengal. Aldous Huxley said, every man’s memory is his private literature. Now, after long last, some of that is becoming public.
Well to my surprise, he decided to do one better for me and purchase a new laptop for me. I was taken back by this kindness, I am not use to having someone wanting to do this for me and I told him it was not necessary, but he insisted that I have a new one, it was his way of saying thank you for putting up with their father, because his father is not a very easy man to put up with.

The matter that we’ll certainly encounter this summer, as with every season, is temptation. Capitalism demands it. Temptation, we can rest assured, is not the only matter and it’s not that which matters most. But the manner that we choose to confront the matter that confronts us lends testimony to our relationship with our Savior and, therefore, is of great import.

How did I resolved the issue? Well after about 11:00 pm I noticed she shut down to go to bed and still hadn’t gotten that bath. I politely went in there and told her to get her bath. She said she wasn’t going to be able to get up for school, I said I really didn’t care. I’d been telling her since 5:00 pm that evening to take her bath. I got upset, she got upset, I’d said some choice words which I later apologized for, but I did not apologize for making her take a late bath. I’d gone from trying to be nice about to acting like the biggest bitch. I had to remind her what my role was and why it was so important for her to do like I asked. She felt that by pissing me off she felt like the biggest f*** to me which I had to reassure her that I never felt that way about her and those words would never ever come out of my mouth because I love her too much to put my own child down like that. I let her know that it just upsets me when with all that I do for the household I can’t get her to do the littlest thing. I hoped she was on the same page as I was because I wasn’t prepared to have that kind of conversation again.

January Jones wouldn’t have been my first choice for Emma Frost but I think she did a pretty good job. I wasn’t hugely impressed with the effect of her in her diamond state, but as many a Twilight fan can attest…getting those damn diamond effects can be challenging. I remember Riptide releasing little projectile stakes while spinning really fast…not so much for creating tornados and crap. I’m not sure why they felt the need to change that, other than to bring down the stealth jet during the climax…which I guess is an ok reason. That devil-looking guy that looks an awful lot like Nightcrawler and uses the same teleportation effect? That would be Azazel. And he looks like Nightcrawler because he’s Nightcrawler’s daddy. Are you wondering why Nightcrawler is blue? That would be because Mystique is his mama…and threw him down a well after he was born. Azazel is biblical and should TECHNICALLY be trapped in an alternate dimension. Thanks to his teleportation skillz he’s able to come here every once in a while for just long enough to knock up a random woman. Which he does. Often.

And you keep going... and then you smile a little, as the pants make it over your hips. Hey! That wasn't so bad. They fit! They fit! There is even a little room. Wouldja look at that?!

(There isn't - it's still a closet.) Even so, you are happy. And so damn proud of yourself. Dude, I am the balls, you think.

Sometimes family is really all you need. This was reinforced to me when my Mother shared a story a few days ago about her mother, my Grandma. You see, when my Grandma was a very young girl, around age 10, she was diagnosed with polio. This meant long hospital stays, extremely limited interaction with children her own age and lonely days staring out the window from her hospital bed. In those days, with polio, they felt keeping the children very subdued and quiet was best, and this particular hospital was as drab as can be. It was also during the time of the Depression, which meant money was tight and life was tough. Day in and day out, she was given the best medicine and treatment, but she wasn’t thriving and recovering. Daily visits from adult doctors and specialists is not exactly stimulating for a young girl. Her health was so poor, at one point, a Catholic Priest had administered the "last rites" at her bedside.

I'm pretty sure that their level of dedication to their craft was not what Jinguk was asking about. A crowd of Jinguk's new fans catch Hyemi outside her own house and forbid her to go in, so it's Samdong to the rescue!

I wondered, when this incident took place, and when they said that 33 people had been killed at a university… I said that I wish I knew who the killer was. My heart was filled with fear, but I realized that they were not saying anything. They knew who it was right from the start. When they realized it was a South Korean, they kept silent. What would have happened if it had been an Arab or a Muslim? If it had been an Arab Muslim who had killed 3 people – not 33 – what would have happened? The world would have turned upside-down. There would have been commotion and turmoil, and all hell would have broken loose. But since he is neither an Arab nor a Muslim, they accepted it somewhat quietly. They did not talk about it much. This is what is called a double standard. A double standard, a triple standard, or even more… That’s America for you.
Well, we ruled out trauma because your daughter hasn’t experienced anything like that . And the culprit are the vaccines just as you had suspected. Doc continues telling you that your daughter is exhibiting ghost like symptoms of TB and you can only sit back and be angry. Angry because you were lied to. Angry at yourself for not having listened to what your gut instinct was telling you back then. You knew before you even gave her one single shot that there was something not right about giving a very healthy baby a disease to prevent her from getting the disease later on. Then you asked people whom you thought wiser than you for advise and they just told you the same thing: “ Give her the shots because you never know what can happen later if you don’t.” So you stop listening to that inner voice and agree to it because you’re a new mother who wants the best for her child and you go against your God-given gut instinct and allow her to be poked in her arm with TB.

6. You know how people say "There's no such thing as bad pizza?" Well, I feel the same way about Doritos. Even the lamest gimmick Doritos, like the mystery flavor a few years back, were fine by me. I can't really get behind Doritos Jacked though. The whole idea behind them negates what Doritos are all about. They made these chips harder to create more of a crunch, but I'd rather not break my teeth, thank you. And even though they amped up the amount of Dorito dust on these suckers, the actual chip is twice the size of a normal Dorito chip. They are more like the size of a restaurant style Tortilla chip. You need to take a few bites of one chip rather than stuff a whole chip in your mouth. Bah. Whatever. If you're going to try them, I suggest the Smoky Chipotle BBQ flavor if you're into that type of thing.

I'll be honest - when I titled my last post 'A serious setback...' I thought I was being a bit dramatic. I was wrong. What started out as a somewhat welcome excuse to scale things back a bit has turned into a full blown running injury that is seriously impacting my ability to train. After a full week of resting and rolling I hopped on a treadmill Saturday morning thinking all was well. Less than a mile into my run my knee began to hurt. I managed to complete 2.5 miles of running/walking - not exactly the 11 miles on my training plan.

I had a facial last week; a vain attempt to prepare my skin in addition to the copious amounts of bio oil I slap on my face. My hair has been a dilemma. I contemplated having it all cut off so it wouldn’t be so noticeable when they shave each side, but then figured that it’s probably best to leave it long - that was idea of growing it in the first place – it would be better to help cover the swelling. And after surgery, I can always have lots of layers cut into it to disguise the scars.

Handling social situations gets easier and easier, especially when I can plan for them. Traveling home last Fall for my cousin’s wedding was easier than I thought it would be. Traveling home last month and being with family nearly 24/7, not so easy.

If nothing else Marge was a coward. When I shouted he kinda lost all coordination of his body and became flustered, caught between doing something drastic and doing nothing at all. Finally he put the needle down on the bed besides me. I picked it up. It was perfectly clean on the outside, but right down inside, where the needle enters the barrel, was a tiny dot of dried black blood. The needle was dirty. It had already been used.
The women expressed their disappointment with the magistrate for the linient sentence given to Emmin Baro and are embarrassed that it was done by a female magistrate. The magistrate did not act as a human being, she acted like a machine. Matembe noted.

Empathy – Tied in with all the above elements, this is what you want your readers to feel. Great rounded characters, tight plot and interesting sub plots, fantastic story with lots of conflict and emotion all mean that the reader will understand the character’s journey, they will empathise. This creates immediacy.
I’m glad Dove has a self-esteem workshop series. I’m glad Italian Vogue ran the “plus-size” cover. But I fervently wish that foundations dedicated to eating disorder advocacy and research would shift their priorities from “eliminating fat talk” to investigating the underlying motivations of anorexia nervosa—in the classical sense. Let the beauty industry fight its own battles against dieting-gone-awry; eating disorder foundations must put their full efforts toward investigating the psychology and physiology of clinical anorexia and bulimia.

Visiting Drancy today is a somewhat unsettling experience. Despite the atrocities that went on here, it is now once again a rundown Parisian housing estate – a so-called banlieue. The buildings that housed thousands of Jewish prisoners before they were sent to Auschwitz now provide homes to French citizens. The square where the prisoners assembled and were required to stand for hours now contains grass and trees. It was only in 1970 that a memorial was erected here: a sculpture of distorted human figures flanked by two crescent-shaped monoliths. A section of railway track leads from the sculpture to a train wagon that bears a Star of David. There are a few plaques situated around the estate – one to the poet Max Jacob, who died here; another to the British soldiers who were held at Drancy in 1940 – but the office of the Conservatoire Historique du Camp de Drancy, at no. 15, seems to no longer be doing much to preserve the history of what happened here, as the photograph below reveals.
BOOM! TIE-DYED affect without the actual tie-dying! (Which would have been faster, but the colors are hardly ever as vivid as these are; plus it would have cost mega $$ since we would have needed every color of dye!)

Usually, I’m not keen on political movies. This movie proves that way of thinking. Does this story need to be told? I lived through that time of the country where the scandal was all on the minds of the media and the country. You would imagine that leaders of the country would be friendly with each other. I felt that I didn’t learn anything from the movie. Maybe the next generation could get some enjoyment out of it.
I rip into the red envelope that is waiting for me at the breakfast table.
I am not sure if it is just because I am an adult, but I guessed early on who the bad guys were. Easy clues, like a guardian that keeps giving wine to his 16 year old niece, should send up warning lights even to the 17 year old!
Following in line with things that would be great in a beauty salon...this Boraxo soap dispenser would be so cute in the bathroom of a vintage decor beauty salon bathroom. Technically this thing would have had that gritty sand-like soap in it. You guys remember that lovely stuff!? But I think liquid could also work in it. Click the image to go...
The stick insects are known for their ponderously slow movements and superb camouflage. With their long bodies, antennae and colors, they do indeed resemble slender twigs. It can sometimes be difficult to tell a stick insect on a plant apart from the plant itself.
(I did get quite a bit of ink on the floor while doing this so I would recommend that you do this on a tiled or wood surface for cleaning purposes. Or, you could just not have 4 kids under the age of 2 crawling on you while you do it. Then you could do it where ever you want.)
I believe that all of the above except the last are legitimate examples of the imitation of Christ. However, it seems that we pick and choose our areas of imitation, often because of personality, preference or the church tradition we are involved in. Perhaps we are looking to find our traits in Jesus and not Jesus’ traits in ourselves. As has been noted of theologically liberal scholars who search for “the historical Jesus” (whatever that means), we often find a Jesus who looks amazingly like us.
If you have been blessed by the writings of Oswald Chambers as I have over the years, you would agree that the Christian world owes a tremendous debt of gratitude to a humble, gracious, and generally unknown woman whose efforts have blessed so many.

The problem is after I work on this for a while I go on overload with all of the ways I can manipulate my original image. I don't see stuff right away. I've learned not to dismiss anything until I give it a second look with fresh eyes.
Many of the essays are on themes that fans of Franzen are now long familiar with: birding, environmentalism, and technology. But while these three recurring themes do permeate Farther Away, readers also get to see the more personal side of Franzen. The book is also filled with essays about some of Franzen’s favorite books (and least favorite books: apparently, the man really has it in for American Pastoral).
Anyways, they had a great turn out and everyone had a fantastic time. The place smelled awful…like dead seafood. Oh wait, it was dead seafood. Ew. And watching everyone rip those little crawfish bodies in half (with the antennae still on) and suck the “meat” out of the body and then the head, made me want to throw up. Every.single.time. And, someone chased me with a crawfish. He almost lost his life. Almost. You’ve been warned, buddy.
Good thing there are crayons and blank place mats when you go to a restaurant with 50 people and the wait time for food is way longer than expected...Not sure what meatballs and eyeballs have in common...
Had Paul questioned the Word of God and remained in Jerusalem it would have been a fruitless ministry. He obeyed and went far hence unto the Gentiles, and many heard the gospel of Jesus Christ and believed and it was through the fall of Israel. Many still believe today, 1900 years later proving the authenticity of the message given by means of that trance.

So…..what do you think? Should I keep it or sell it? So far everyone loves it. Well…..except Hubby. He just wants the fastest path from point A to point B. We’ve been arguing for years about a center island. I told him this one wasn’t staying. And I REALLY REALLY meant it…….at the time!
So, grab yourself the first Vulcan (or other non-terrestrial biological entity) you meet, wriggle to the left, wriggle to the right, and do the Ooby Dooby with all of your might. Let’s get this party started.
You know why they're not using "You know me"? Because we know him, and it's not a plus.

After boasting that he knew nothing about the Commission, Mr. Bradley's first move was to unilaterally cancel that meeting, stunning the public and policymakers, as well as his fellow Commission members. According to press reports, Mr. Bradley then ordered all Commissioners to delete their Commission-related emails, and declared that he wouldn’t let the Commission meet until he had time to learn more about it. Mr. Bradley displayed a shocking lack of objectivity in his work by declaring to the press that “Willingham is a guilty monster,” a clearly inappropriate statement from the Chair of a state Commission tasked to provide independent, expert investigations of allegations of forensic negligence or misconduct.

But going out of state isn't an option for everyone. L'Ailee's uncle had given us money as a wedding gift, and I chipped in more from selling my truck, which was more of a liability than an asset in New York. So we were able to reserve the big conference/banquest room at the bed and breakfast, to make the trip, to help people we loved with their plane tickets. Our wedding wasn't particularly lavish, but we can't replicate it anytime soon. Her best friend, a cabbie, could only afford to take a day trip. My best friend, a chef, couldn't get time off for a honeymoon. We know other working-class same-sex couples would have a real struggle with expenses, especially if they're senior citizens or raising children. I'm glad that same-sex couples in New York now have the ability to go to their own city hall or place of worship.
The most unusual and hauntingly beautiful displays were in the HimalaSalt booth. The generous slabs and pillars of Himalayan salt created dramatic tablescapes, especially when they are backlit with low-voltage bulbs.

Had some problems earlier this month removing the swimming pool cover. As in, it got waterlogged and I had to dump the top of the cover into the water because I couldn't lift it out. So the pool was green and filled with lots and lots of dead leaves. The whole leaves aren't the problem, it's the decayed leaf powder that doesn't stay on the bottom of the pool to be vacuumed up. It's about 90-95% cleaned up, and the water is clear and algae-free, though.
If I recall correctly, renting a steam-cleaner is $35-$50 a day, a little less for half-day rentals, plus gas for getting it and returning it. And, being that I will need it two times, if just half days, and just for this time, I am expecting at least $60 in rental fees. I noticed, while shopping, that a smaller steam-cleaner with a good name (for whatever that means these days sometimes), for $80. With only a small total area of carpeting, the size would be right. Considering rental prices, hassle, and travel... owning might be best. As well, not having to rush things, or have two rooms completely empty at a time, or having to do this and that all at once, buying seems... better. If I can get a good tool at the right price. I'm... thinking on it.
On the market - Quite bafflingly elusive, considering its unparalleled heritage and its epic status within the industry. Although, there's nothing quite like cult status, and that can demand a certain level of calculated elusiveness. Try online at Ocado.
In small corners and avenues of remembrance people have planted trees. Some to remember the places they came from, some to remember the people they have lost. Many of these trees suffer in the dry summers and may not last through the next few years. Trees that were planted so that some corner of a foreign field would seem to be England, or that death of Australians in a foreign land would not be forgotten, show their mortality. At the turning of the year history comes knocking at our door.
As of today two more triathlons have been marked off my list, without fail the water won. There is another coming up this weekend. This time Beth will be there again, but not Miss Ivey. My plan is to give up my battle for control and let God take the reigns. So the control freak in me is taking on a task. Relinquishing the control freak that has taken so many years to perfect. This is going to be a phenomenal task especially when I exude needing control as I turn into a waterlogged, wetsuit wearing hysterical girl whom looks like a water phobic cat that has been thrown in the lake. So other than my own mental sideshow, the swim is going to be great!

Another favorite scripture is this: Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it.

And so dear readers I have been remiss in writing here, but my heart was with you and you were so very often in my thoughts. I am planning a great many offshoots of my budding business, Maitri's Heart & Hands, that come out of being a writer, journal teacher of 30 years, healer, gardener, artist, and more. The many facets of my life are coming together, all of a piece, in the most wondrous ways and I can't wait to share them with you. I offer all that I do in love. I send gentle reiki energy out to you in waves. Feel it like a breeze against your cheek. Know how very much you are loved. We are never alone, even sitting by ourselves in our own homes. Tap into the energy that surrounds you, feel it, you can if you try. I feel it very strongly in my daily meditations, 3 times a day. I feel it when I am washing dishes, imagining all of the other women, and men, standing at their sinks, hands in hot water and bubbles as they do their daily chore, and I feel a oneness with the whole world around me. I feel that with you now.
The five individuals called for an investigation by the Office of Inspector General, backed by Senators and Congressmen. After 21 months, the Office concluded that there was no evidence demonstrating a system-wide attitude, but rather was contained only to immediate training staff in one office.
On the way to this one, we happened upon a ramshackle building with a sign outside that said "Modern Cottages" . The building was a stone cottage with undeniable mystique, so the teenagers were once again out of the car with the camera. I was glad to let them do that, but by the time we got to the National Park, it was closed. That settled it, at least for Middle Child and her cohort: we were camping out.
It was never my intention to get attached to a home, trying to keep everything "just business." But to get dealt a blow from out of nowhere has left us wobbly; Questioning whether or not to keep looking. Wondering if the process is worth it.

I hadn't used the account in nearly six years. I had no idea if it still existed or if I could even remember the password. I held my breath, crossed my fingers, and SUCCESS! I actually remembered the password (a huge accomplishment considering it's been six years and three kids since I accessed it) and all the pics . . . they were there!

But, now it is on to the last official event of the con’ for me, which was the presentation “Super-Syncretism!: Creating Connection & Preserving Diversity,” which was fairly well attended for being in the final session of the con’. There were probably close to 30 people there, and the audience was very participatory, in very positive manners. In fact, one attendee–with whom I had spoken a bit last year and this year–entirely changed my mind on a particular issue–very interestingly, because I had no official notes or remarks on it that I wanted to mention, merely the topic itself. So, not only did the attendees get something useful out of the whole business, but I got something that I feel is extremely useful out of it as well! It was a very good presentation, and it would have been nice if it had been one that the con’ had audio or video recorded…perhaps in the future, people who have access to those technologies who are able to attend can take care of that so these things might be shared more widely in the future. But, a write-up will have to suffice for now, eh? Therefore, without further ado…
Mucho love-o,

If you don't want to respond, read this document anyway. It's short (15 sides, inclusive of the bits you don't need to read), well-written and devoid of the unnecessary artwork and acreage of white space that seems to accompany so many print-out-and-read documents emanating from the public sector. It also contains a useful potted history of IP litigation and representation over the past couple of decades or so.
The life of wealth often yields forms of deprivation that are simply not appealing to sensible adults. It heralds an ugly world of sour adages: life is unfair; you have to look out for yourself; you have all the friends that money can buy. Wealth brings fantasies as to the specialness of one’s life and activities, when in fact there tend to be a dozen others who stand ready to take one’s place. It brings disproportionate responsibility for maladies cited above — for environmental destruction, exploitation of people, infliction of harm on innocents.

This pregnancy has been uneventful just as they were with both Abby and Jocelyn. As April 18th approaches I find every emotion go through my mind. I am excited. Excited to hold a newborn baby girl. I’m nervous. Nervous about how I will juggle life with 3 little ones to take care of. I'm grateful. Grateful that everything is telling us that baby girl is healthy and strong. I’m scared. Scared that something unexpected will happen. I’m anxious. Anxious that the delivery wont go as planned. I’m hopeful. Hopeful that after the arrival of Baby Girl that some healing will have taken place as the emotions are still so raw from the delivery and weeks that followed with Sweet Jocelyn Rose. As my due date approaches I find the emotions of nervousness, being scared, anxiousness fading. Excitement, gratefulness and being hopeful are now consuming my thoughts. She will be perfect, just like her big sisters, I just know she will:)

I looked up at the guy and he was holding a 100 rupee note and waving it at me with an annoyed expression. I figured that I had probably given him a 100 rupee note by mistake so I took it back from him, tucked it into my wallet and handed out what I thought (again) was a 1000 Rs. note. My mistake (in hindsight) was that I was not looking at him but looking at my wallet throughout.

I have told the Spouse Sparrow all about it, of course. He's getting fairly used to the attention from womenfolk here in the States now, as they throw themselves at him, even with me standing right there. I mean, I am obviously his wife, we obviously have a kid together, as he is right fucking there in the stroller, and the Spouse Sparrow will still get women hitting on him in the shops. Right in front of me. Did I mention the "right in front of me" bit? Because the hotties are doing it right in front of me. I mean, I understand the attraction, really. He's cute, witty, has a really good accent, and they can see that he is great with kids and is a hands-on dad. Still, if the stupid bints could just manage to restrain themselves until I walked over to the next fucking aisle I wouldn't be slagging them off half so much, the stupid whoring twats. It's a good thing I'm not the jealous type.
So, whenever I decide to quit renting and buy a house for myself, I am going out to my ex-husbands to collect all the toys and books that he is keeping for the kids.

Regarding Jews, I admit they are treated favorably, though I maintain less favorably than other minorities. (See my post on the Hierarchy of Entitlement, for example.) I agree that this should not happen, and that there are many false accusations of anti-Semitism made (including against me). I agree that false accusations of anti-Semitism should stop. But you still claim I’m showing favoritism toward Jews, I suppose because you believe that Jews belong at the top of my Hierarchy of Entitlement. So in your mind, I’m denying that MMRILS applies to Jews, but I maintain that I’m not.
“The Raven” as a movie demonstrates that you can make a movie that bridges the biographical facts of Poe’s life and its own artistic vision and still make an interesting movie. The movie is driven by the premise, a serial killer starts a series of killings in Baltimore that emulate some of the more gruesome murders in Poe’s stories. When the first murder is done inside a locked room, police detective Fields (Luke Evans) recognizes it as the setting of an Edgar Allan Poe story. Fields brings in Poe (John Cusack) at first as suspect, but when another murder occurs Poe quickly becomes the first criminal profiler and consultant. Poe helps Fields both in what kind of mind the killer may have and of course in the details from his stories. The killer kidnaps Poe’s girlfriend Emily (Alice Eve) with the killer promising clues as to Emily’s whereabouts with each new murder he commits.
One of Millnet’s big successes recently has been the introduction of what they call Smart Insourcing, which they describe as “the alternative to legal process outsourcing”. From a law firm’s viewpoint, there is a gap between keeping all the eDisclosure work in-house and sending it all out, perhaps offshore. Like many providers, Millnet offers extremely good consultancy services which clients can call on as needed; the ability to call down such help on demand and from a trusted source is a significant benefit for clients.

World Health Organization (WHO) recently fugures out that about 150 million people suffer from asthma worldwide. The inflammatory disease of the airways causes the bronchi to cramp. Due to the experienced impaired breathing during physical exercise, asthmatics often avoid sports activities. But they should not! Not only physical fitness may decrease progressively; even light physical exercises can cause enormous difficulties in breathing. A study reveals that asthmatics that do sports suffer less from asthmatic attacks and can cope with their disease considerably better.

Last year I discovered that you roll eggs down a hill to symbolise the rolling of the stone Jesus used when he came back to life. Fiction is great, isn't it? You can make up whatever you want. It's a great lesson for kids. Oh no, someone you love is dead? Don't worry, go find a cave with a stone in front of it and wait for that person to be resurrected. It works every time. Again, I'm trying to bring logic to the Bible, I really need to stop doing that.

Lest I forget the staple of the Christian life, guilt; guilt when we mess up, guilt for missing one Sunday service, guilt for humming the newest secular hit, guilt for our sexual humanistic thoughts, guilt for the doubt that we may struggle with, the anger we feel when a loved one is taken in a moment from us. Most of all, the guilt we feel when we can’t live up to the Christian model that is dangled in front of us. I always felt like I could never live up to what God wanted me to be.

Finally……so so so so so fiery that after being awarded a free kick for being tackled by a striker, he got treated by the Stuttgart physio, got up, grabbed the ball as if he was going to take the free kick, went to the guilty striker’s path, stamped on the striker’s foot intentionally, got a red card and went straight home without taking a shower in the dressing room.

This gap is felt when sitting, talking, and most acutely when eating. Only soft foods at the moment...and no straws. I tear up now just sharing this with you.
Because he is with us, we are able to stand. Zachary, you chose as your personal confirmation verse an encouragement from the book of Revelation: Be faithful, even to the point of death, and I will give you the crown of life. (Revelations 2:10b) Because Jesus is with you, you will be faithful, even to the point of death. What gives us that ability? Remembering that Jesus rescued us in the first place.
I have always said that “you cannot hide who you are”… In an earlier post, I made a statement about my husband:
We will never realize the terrible loneliness and longing for loved ones which the women of those early times endured. I recall the day that word came that grandfather Stevens had suffered a stroke and was lying at the point of death. Father was away from home doing some carpenter work for a neighbor. That night mother asked me to go out and walk with her. There were deep paths worn in the prairie and along one of these we walked, my hand in hers. I cannot remember of anything being said, but a battle was fought and won out there under the stars as she paced back and forth for what seemed a long time, for when father retuned home the next day, he begged her to take the money he had earned and go east to see her father. How anxiously I listened to the conversation, wondering how we could live with mother away, but the answer was, “no, the money is needed for the family,” and could not be persuaded otherwise. Did the clinging hand of a little child have a part in that decision? Grandfather rallied and lived several years but mother never saw her parents after the parting as she left to come West.-Abbie Ruff Sidebottom

That’s a strange title isn’t it? I heard that term while taking a tour of a brothel museum and, through my travels and research, have not seen or heard that term since. The owner of the museum threw it out there and, I assume, made it up. However, it is a good way to describe the experience of many in the Red Light Districts of the American West. When people hear the word Victorian, they think of a historical era of proper manners, speech, fashion and writing; a time of economic prosperity and technological advancement. Of course, brothelese brings to mind houses of prostitution. Put those two words together, and you have a good start at understanding the brothels that I have studied.
We’re almost there. Now we will glue the bow on the wire. Put the most beautiful side of the bow on the table, then put the wire on it (were the third crimp beads is) and take the super glue. Put one or two drops of super glue on the wire and the bow. To make sure it is fixed in place take a little piece of the same fabric and put it on the bow. Hold firmly for about ten seconds.
Spiritually, we also wonder why it is that the Lord is bringing up the 2 doorkeepers once again at this particular point in time? That is, the night the king cannot sleep is leading into the 17th day of the 2nd month. It is early in the morning on the 17th day of the 2nd month when the king asks the question, “who is in the court?” To remind us, the 17th day of the 2nd month was the date that God shut Noah and his family in the ark and the flood began. 7000 years later, in the year 2011 A.D., it was the 17th day of the 2nd month when the great tribulation ended and Judgment Day began (May 21, 2011 in our Gregorian calendar).

On the way back from the sunrise Easter service on the beach this morning, I collected shells to compose this tiny Easter basket (a Worm shell, Top shell, Common bubble, Lightning whelk, Common baby’s ear, and Atlantic coquina in a Buttercup lucine basket). For me, nature and art (or even better, combining the two) are essentially equivalent to, or essential triggers for, whatever is meant by “spirituality.”

“Not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near… But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you… Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it… I was glad when they said to me, “Let us go to the house of the LORD” (Hebrews 10:25; Matthew 6:33; 10:37-38; Psalm 122:1).
Hargreaves, 30, has made just appearance for United at senior level since late 2009 – lasting the first five minutes of a Premier League match with Wolves last November before hobbling down the tunnel. Although he was severely hampered by injury in four years at Old Trafford, the £17 million signing did make several notable contributions to Manchester United’s recent success – scoring the winner from a free kick in a memorable Premier League clash with Arsenal and slotting home a penalty in the shoot-out which won United the 2008 Champions’ League title.
Over the years I had thought more and more about my birth mother, for some reason with every birthday, I would calculate how old that she would be .

The mother and daughter danced and feasted with the rest of the assembled, until from up high came the time for the unveiling of the new Stormwind Keep. A hush drew over the crowed as the stirring speech ((that I am far too lazy to write right now because, come on, speeches are pretty boring like most of the start of this)) from the king (( regent? Who is in charge of Stormwind right now? )) himself. There was much applause and cheering from the speech.

I am not even going to try to say anything about the songs I have already heard. Except that I can recognize the earnest craftsmanship in them that I have learned to love in Bruce. And that – as arrangements are coming through and air tickets have been bought – my first Springsteen concerts are becoming much more than a vague experience far in the future. It is growing to be very much part of my reality. And honestly, I have never felt so much alive …

The Minster is magnificent; and enormous for such a small town (population under 10,000!). Funnily enough most locals call their town “South-well” whereas people in the Cathedral opt for the more clipped “Suthall Minister” – I managed to avoid the dilemma all day, though a friend of mine at uni used to swear by the ‘local’ pronunciation.
“In my childhood memory, grandpa takes me here once a month, to walk the streets, narrow and crowded but in a lovely way. We purchase some daily goods, like shoes, scissors, tea, and clothes. I still remember holding my grandpa’s hand and squeezing our way back and forth from one store to another. Today, Dashilan has totally changed its form. The street must have widened three times at least. And it also has become much cleaner a place. But where is the savor of Kaorouji’s roast meat? Where is the refreshing smell of Zhang Yiyuan’s tea? They are part of my childhood memories. Today we walk without mentioning the past.”
I need not have been too surprised, though.
“We were gobsmacked”, admitted one officer, notable for his pixelated face and actor’s voice. “You may think it unusual, but suicides like this happen all the time in the Service. I remember one chap who cut himself into 89 pieces and scattered himself liberally between Minsk and Dubrovnik a few years back. At first some people suggested he might not have topped himself, but we didn’t find any fingerprints at the scenes so it was definitely suicide.

The tower’s unique properties allow for an equally innovative construction process. Instead of building the tower from the ground up, floor by floor as most skyscrapers are built, the rotating tower will be built in parallel stages. As a team on site builds the enormous concrete core, or spine of the building, complete with the elevators, a separate team will be working in a dedicated factory, prefabricating each floor in segments. Once the core is complete, the segments will be lifted up the side of the building and each floor will be assembled and attached, from the top floor down, around the central spine.

Despite his immediate conversion, the woman gave him a sign. Perhaps she knew what passion Christ had planned for him. The man and the donkey vanished. The woman rose above his head and gave off a spectacular light. The golden sand about his feet became royal blue in the glow, and Peter thought that if the sand was truly gold it could never be as fair as that blue. The woman rose higher and higher, just before she vanished she made the Sign of the Cross and a voice, like a whisper in his ear said, “Remember me at the end.”

So it's officially Christmas shopping season, and everyone is talking about how far along they are in their shopping and wrapping, what the kids want for Christmas, how this year's haul or celebration will size up to prior years, and the (choose one) moral repugnance or innocent thrill of the Black Friday greed stampede.
This reminds me of doing (or not) my Maths homework - trying a couple of the easier bits then refusing to do the rest while sulking and whining "It's not fair! I hate Maths!"

Additionally, the children agree to do the work, not to play. If a child is attempting to find the correct match to say a purple color tablet and returns with that matching tablet only to be told by the child sitting at the rug that they brought the wrong one due to the fact that they have changed their mind regarding which color tablet that needs to be paired, a dispute may occur. The selected object to be paired can not be changed once the child with the tray has left the rug seeking its match. It is pychologically frustrating to make a correct decision and to have that decision be received as incorrect. Again, working together should build trust. In this case, trust that the work will be done correctly and honestly.

“I honestly just wanted to get those points,” he said of the final race in which Cho crashed, the 3,000-meter race. Simon finished fourth, while Cho was seventh. He felt for Cho getting tangled in the crash, but knew all he had to do was stay on his feet to earn the U.S. title.
The oral surgeon did a great job of getting it out and I am happy with my decision to just have local anthesia and some laughing gas. The laughing gas wore off in about 5 minutes and I was happy to be able to understand the instructions I was given--that's a surgery first for me! It only took about 4 hours for my face to regain feeling.

I have mixed feelings of how I should feel with posed with this question. I hate to spring the whole "my child passed away" thing on people, but then I feel flat our guilty if I don't mention you. So... I have decided I'd rather make people uncomfortable for a brief moment... and hope that I have the chance to tell your story.
In other parts of the world, our system of government is baffling, particularly for the way it deliberately slows the passage of various legislative proposals. Writing recently in El Mundo, a leading newspaper in Spain, Prof. Rafael Navarro-Valls, said, “The problem, it seems to me, is that we should first consider the very system of power in America. When speaking of the U.S. President as the most powerful man in the world, one forgets the rules of the political circus in which he functions.”
Where do I get my addresses from? Why people who sign up for my e newsletter. There's the option of adding your address, and if you do, you'll get a postcard. Also, I'd love to know if there are libraries out there who would like to be notified of my new books, and/or if they would like signed bookmarks to hand out to patrons. So if you haven't already signed up, do it now--there's a sign-up form right on this page--scroll down if you don't already see it.

But, we are expected to believe that the third time must be a charm? This winter, Mathematica was contracted by HHS to review evaluations for their rigor, and this time they recommended Heritage Keepers for inclusion on the list of HHS-approved programs. To date, there is still no published peer-reviewed manuscript to help assess what, if anything, changed for the program to make the list. Was a new study conducted? Did the authors submit new data or simply rework the old?
Serious damage has been done and much of it is irreparable. Imagine what would have happened if we had allowed her to continue to be abused at their hands. Always loving, always forgiving, always excusing... always the object of their abuse. You correctly stated that I am the adult and she is the child. Consequently, I will allow her to continue to forgive and love and grow and be a child in a healthy environment. And on the adult side of things, her dad and I will be happy to absorb the fallout of that unpopular decision.

There was a smaller studio around the corner from the hallway. I stopped by the front door. It was The Crooning Cowboy show. The Crooning Cowboy as you could guess was a singing cowpoke picking tunes off the shiniest guitar I’ve ever seen. Since the studio was so small he couldn’t really afford a fancy backdrop, just a mike and his guitar.
If the local government sector was a person they would be ponderous, socially-inept and morally bankrupt. They would be filthy rich and very lazy. If you had a problem they would not care and if you complained because something they did hurt you or your family, their response would be “so sue me”.

I LOVED them. The first book was interesting. It didn't exactly grab me by the neck and pull me into the story, but it was definitely interesting enough to read the second book. About halfway through the second book, I was thoroughly yanked into the books by a choke-hold and couldn't read fast enough. The characters are so detailed and interesting. There are mysteries you need to know the answer to. There are twists and turns that keep you guessing. Plus quite a shocker ending. If I could figure out how to implement the star rating system into my blog (any tips?) I would rate this series a 4.5 out of 5.
The story concerns the manuscript of Edgar Hopkins, written some years after the cataclysm that occurred back in May 1946 when the moon fell into the Earth. It is the only surviving account of daily life in the months leading up to, and after the disaster. Edgar is a retired schoolmaster (but still only in his late forties), who lives on the Sussex downs. He amuses himself by breeding prize-winning chickens, clipping his yew hedges and going up to London to meetings of the Lunar Society every month.

And of course, dad. What was most heartbreaking about this book is that it doesn’t end with reconciliation. Carroll and his father end up permanently (at least in this world) separated from one another. The last lines of the book are like a gut punch. Read it and you’ll know what I mean. What a sad story, and what a perfect reminder of how fortunate I am. Dad and I have certainly had our rough patches—typical father son drama—but today, boy am I lucky. Fond memories far outweigh the arguments. I’m grateful for his advice and his perspective. And I’ll always be thankful for a very personal and important trip with him to visit the Vietnam Wall in DC. (Maybe the connection to Vietnam was why this book struck such a chord.) James Carroll wasn’t so lucky.

Here’s the deal: you upload a picture you are particularly proud of, then you are given about a zillion, confusing paint tools that allow you to turn your photos into masterpieces. It actually requires skill and there is a bit of a learning curve, but all good things take time, right? You also have the gustier option of just painting, without uploading a photo. It’s like Microsoft Paint, but you way cooler; instead of creating something that looks like it was ‘painted’ by a five-year old having a seizure, you can make images that look like you brought Van Gogh back from the dead and ordered him to recreate your photo. Dopeness.
Example: So I’m laying in bed last night after a busy day of launching my blog and I decide to check Facebook one last time before I fall asleep (mistake #1), only to find a snide comment under one of my posts left by a “friend”, who obviously does not approve of my new venture. As having “thick skin” is not one of my strong points, I lay there questioning why she would do such a thing, and in a public forum no less (mistake #2). At the same time, I did have a fan who shared my post and gave it a great review (which I am very appreciative of – THANK YOU!!), saying that she loved what I had written and was looking forward to reading more. Despite that, though, the pissy, bitchy little comment was all I could think about. For the next 20 minutes, I lay there in bed trying to figure out how to respond. Do I confront her? Do I type a pissy, bitchy message back for all to see? Or do I try to forget about it and not let it bother me (almost impossible).
Now I feel like I'm focused on the number.

A large number of competent manuscripts cross editors’ and agents’ desk these days, and I can’t think of a worse adjective than “competent.” They want a manuscript that sings. And a manuscript that sings to one editor won’t to another. So much is subjective. So editors and agents choose what they like. I’ve heard enough editors and agents say exactly those words—they choose what they like—that I absolutely believe it. I also believe most of the stuff that hits their desks is terrible and not ready for publication. Not to sound mean or superior, but a lot of writers have an unrealistic opinion of their abilities. That doesn’t mean they can’t learn; it just means they aren’t ready.
I would change the fact that deep in my core, I feel I am unlovable. My friend Christian, while he was here in Oman, hit on this during a Tarot reading, and I knew the truth of it when I heard it. It wasn’t something I consciously recognized. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I know I do and I can’t seem to change it. This belief makes relationships painful because I can never really believe the other person loves me. This is probably why I am alone.

There’s no doubt that makeup artists create magic. Their art tells a story. Sometimes it’s a story of glamour, sometimes it’s the story reflected in the season’s fashions, and sometimes it’s the reflection of a story being told by a script. What you may not know, though, is that freelance makeup artists also create lucrative careers in the worlds of fashion, celebrity, advertising, print media, music, television, and film.

God, Girls and Getting Connected is a fantastic devotional that will reach teen girls right where they are. There is a ton of reflection questions and activity's for girls to read and do as they discover truths God, Identity, Relationships and Life (or GIRL, the acronym used in the book). The topics are all relevant and fresh, without being preachy, an appealing method of teaching for sure. This is a superb gift idea for any teen girl in your life, particularly for graduation, which is just around the corner for many.

There’d been a fuss going on at the station. The Mayor and lots of camera crews were there, so I wasn’t surprised that the trains were late. I took her through the back way where my bus was waiting.

EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J.—I have just returned from a day in New York—much of it spent taking in a scintillating double bill at both New York's IFC Center and Film Forum, but some of it spent walking around in the glorious sunshine.

“Friend, I announce here in public: Your sins are forgiven!”
Uh, what a day. Working in my office at the same time as contemplating many personal things. I’m the type of guy that needs to know the answers of things. Well, not only answers, but logical explanations about events that affect me. I’m gradually gaining peace though and I have no hard feelings toward anybody. I just feel that I must have missed the facts of some past things or perhaps some facts were intentionally hidden from me. I’ll use all the learning to make a better future. Even just looking at the facts I do know, I’m doing the best thing now I guess. I believe my feet are now on a well-constructed path where landslides and potholes can be avoided (mostly.) One thing I’ve learned is that to build something well, you have to be prepared to possibly invest years of work. It’s a lot! People have baggage and it’s quite a process fitting into the same taxi to begin a new journey of life together. Some will never get to the point of being able to put some of that in the trunk and forget it! Some just stay in the same cyclic routine for many years. Ironically and maybe only personal coincidence, but I’ve discovered that those same people are the ones to preach about how to have a good relationship.

Marcelo Duarte, a biologist who has visited Snake Island over twenty times, says that the locals' claim of one to five snakes per square meter is an exaggeration, though perhaps not by much. One snake per square meter is more like it. Not that that should ease one's mind: At one snake per meter, you're never more than three feet away from death.

I tried to tie each fruit to the season, wherever possible, and I tell you it took a certain amount of self-control on my part not to make "Self-Control" the very first one we studied! :) I didn't really think I should start the year off harping on them. The journal questions for this month are: "What did I do to show someone else kindness today?" and "How was someone else kind to me?".

We can always pay one of their preachers to spin the story to our benefit.

It begins with their attendance at a soiree hosted by the newspaper mogul and noted amateur spiritualist and archaeologist, Jefferson Shaw. As his guests, they have to listen to him expound upon his recent archaeological exploits in the Valley of the Kings and his theories upon the subject of parapsychology, before revealing his pièce de résistance. This is not the fact that luncheon is provided by Café Parisien, the a la carte restaurant and a haute cuisine establishment run as a concession aboard the RMS Titanic, but is instead the fact that Jefferson Shaw will unveil his latest and greatest find from Egypt – a Mummy – before donating it to the Metropolitan Museum of Art when the ship docks in New York.

We must learn how to develop technology that is not only built for quicker processing, ease of access, and multitasking, but also built with our body and health in mind as well. We must not only keep our bodies fit, but also our minds. If we get too connected to technology, in situations where we are unable to use it – such as it being broken, under maintenance, or out of reach – we will be completely lost.

To create this card, I cut a 4" scalloped circle in chocolate and layered a 3.5" white circle on top which I sponged the edges of using hollyhock ink. I stamped the saying '4 my friend' on an 4" olive colored banner which I also sponged the edges of. The cupcake is cut at 2.5" inches and stamped on chocolate cardstock and then restamped on blush cardstock. I cut the icing off of the blush cardstock and used dimensionals to layer it on top of the chocolate! Finally I finished it off with glitter glue and added three pink brads to the scalloped strip to give it some personality :)

Like Pixie, I don’t read a book close to the release of the movie. If I do, I spend the whole time comparing the movie to the book and I have found I don’t enjoy the movie as much when I do that. I have a terrible memory, so by the time we went to the midnight showing of The Hunger Games, I pretty much only remembered a few of the characters and the basic plot. Seriously, my memory is that bad.

Now, back to this life thing. There are no Band-Aids for life. There are no miracle cures. Seldom is it possible to kiss it better. And when it wears out, there is no such thing as buying a new pair, regardless of how much money one has. So what is a person to do with this new life that is strange and foreign and terrifying? What does one do when everything they recognize and hold dear is suddenly one day gone and replaced by a series of colorful imposters?

After the novel was published my interest in burial places became a passion. And when researching a period of history often I’ll begin with the end, in that burial customs indicate mindset. Particular examples illuminate so much: the occupation and interests of the deceased, size of family, lifestyle and interests, and on and on. Older ones are sprinkled with Guild Marks, or with work tools that are now unfamiliar to us. You can have a guess at some of these. The glove on the 1687 memorial from Elgin Cathedral does not (as one child asked me) mean that Michael Jackson is buried there! Glove-making was big business in those days. Below the personal information about the deceased is one of my favourite inscriptions:

So, depite the remaining minutes being almost entirely in my favour, I was also nervously waiting for this “action”, whatever it was. After fixing 11 Feb as the next hearing, the judge brought up that matter of an outstanding Warrant of Arrest against me.

What a WONDERFUL month May is shaping up to be. Do you have plans to get out and view the SUPER MOON this weekend? I sure plan to.....I have lots of plans for this month. Starting with VACATION -- I am taking off some time from my job. Some of that time will be vacation and some will be STAYcation -- I am looking forward to BOTH. I have plans for flower planting and porch furniture painting and graduation receptions attending. Leisure mornings with a cup of coffee in hand, lunches and dinners with friends and working on some cookbook reviews. Ahhh!

The situation now is not of romanticizing but rather that the fact poor and angry young men and women, who see no future for themselves, are easy targets for terrorists and extremist recruiters. It is only because of unemployment that the younger generation takes to terrorism in order to generate income and fulfils its needs. So the youths knowingly or unknowingly embrace Naxalism. In some cases, people are driven to the Naxal world by the Naxalites themselves and are paid attractive amounts.

The first pizza we made was Scott's request. He went to a restaurant in Santa Fe, NM during one of his business trips and had a pizza that he really enjoyed. The pizza had roasted garlic (to roast garlic, cut the end off of a head of garlic, drizzle with olive oil, wrap in foil and bake at 400 degrees for 35 minutes...then squeeze it out and smear it on the crust), fresh mozzarella, baby portabellas, regular mushrooms, oregano, and grated Romano cheese. When the pizza came out of the oven, we drizzled it with truffle oil. (I hope I can find more uses for that truffle oil because that was an expensive purchase!)

However, that’s not what a degree is, especially today. If you merely invest $120,000 on a degree from the other end of the NACE spectrum, say Chemical Engineering, and complete the requirements for that degree, you may have more opportunities after graduation than your classmate that did the same but earned a degree in Agriculture. However, you won’t have nearly the opportunities of a person in any degree program who invested not only his or her money, but other assets such as time (building experiences in focused internships, employment and volunteerism) and relationships (what we call “networking” these days).
All of this is temporal, having to do with the things of this life. But what is the hope of the believer? It is certainly not this world or the things of this world. How many Christians heed the admonition of Colossians 3:1-2? “If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.”
When we were visiting the Kahala, they were actually setting up for a sunset wedding at their Diamond Head Gazebo (photos above).

Aren't those little hanging vases cute? Another idea is to just hang the orchid heads. There are so many creative things you can do... the possibilities are endless!

In the interview on the DVD, Ibáñez Serrador says he thinks the one mistake he made with the film was putting the opening sequence at the beginning rather than the end. Ending with those scenes of atrocity would have certainly been jarring, and might, indeed, have worked better: we would have been happily cheering on the killing of children, maybe a little uncomfortable at the thought, but nonetheless content that it was all "just a movie" and then we would have had proof that no, in fact, our willingness to kill children is not confined to killing the demonic ones in movies.

No, I do not at all blame the people doing the retouching. They are just following their clients’ wishes. Yet, I do wonder about the morality of a marketing manager who can look at a photo of a woman already bursting out the seams, and say, “They’re no good. Make them larger.”

We also squeezed in a weekend trip to Paris. We went to the Louvre, which I was super stoked about. Not only because it's the largest and maybe the most famous museum in the world, but because last time I went there (8 years or so ago), I was really sick and kind of had to lay down on benches the whole time. So needless to say, the 2nd time around was much more interesting and fruitful. We also cruised down la Seine, saw the Eiffel Tower and partied with frenchies. All in all it was a successful trip to Paris.

Then, one day, Marsha outgrew me.

Overall, Code Name Verity was a fantastic and rich read, a refreshing break from boy-crazy girls and instead having main characters who have things that are a lot more life-threatening than romance to worry about. There were lots of great twists and turns to keep the reader engaged. Though it did have a slow start as well as a few other portions I was tempted to skim, I was glad I didn't because in the end everything tied together in an emotional and absolutely heart-breaking way. In the end, Wein's novel is well-researched and well-written; Code Name Verity is a powerful story of friendship from an insightful and unique perspective.
The man said, "But no longer. Your name is no longer Jacob. From now on it is Israel; you’ve wrestled with God and you’ve come through." Jacob asked, "And what’s your name?" The man said, "Why do you want to know my name?" And then, right then and there, he blessed him. Jacob named the place Peniel because, he said, "I saw God face-to-face and lived to tell the story!" The sun came up as he left Peniel, limping because of his hip being knocked out of joint.
Circumcision was a major factor in Jewish identity. For many in the Greco-Roman world, it was circumcision which set the Jews apart, usually for ridicule. Marital, for example, seems to find a great deal of humor in the Jewish practice (Epigrams 7.35.3-4; 7,82, 11.94. Some of Marital’s comments on circumcision are so crude the original Loeb translators did not translate them into English so as not to offend sensitive readers, choosing instead to translate them into Italian. A new edition of Marital has been produced for the Loeb series by D. R. Shackleton Baily which not only translates these epigrams, but seems to strive to offend!) All Jewish males were circumcised on the eighth day, a practice noted in the New Testament (Lk. 2:21; Phil. 3:5). There was some question as to the need for circumcision when a Gentile converted to Judaism. One of the first major controversies of the early church concerned the practice of Gentile circumcision, indicating the very close alignment of the earliest Christianity and Judaism.
Cut up your veggies. You can use any mix you want and this is a great way to use up your remnant veggies. I used some broccoli, squash, zucchini and red onion.Place in baking dish. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with the balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper and red pepper flakes (if you wish). Stir until coated. Add into the oven when there is about 10 minutes to go on the timer. Or until they reach the level of tenderness that you like. I like for things to be cooked but still a little crunch (al dente!)

Oh..and you can blame it on the mistakes that I made in the last couple of years that we were together…tell yourself and anyone else who will listen that I “cheated” on you. But, you and I both know that all of these things were always there…and began from the very first year of our marriage, then progressively got worse. All I did was give you the justification to do what you had already been doing. I never cheated on you…I did have an emotional affair, that’s true. I know that hurt you, and I wish I hadn’t hurt you, but, the truth is, I just felt so alone….and I didn’t trust you enough to be able to talk to you, because anything I was feeling was wrong anyway….

LONDON— Corruption is a much larger problem in Britain than acknowledged and key institutions are refusing to confront the problem, a global watchdog warned Wednesday. Transparency International UK called the findings of its two-year study into corruption in the UK a “corruption health-check” for the country — with a diagnosis of “growing threat, inadequate response”. The group said its research found that corruption is flourishing in some parts of the UK and there is “disturbing evidence” of denial in policy responses to the issue. “There is complacency and a lack of knowledge of the extent of corruption in key sectors and institutions,” according to the study.

I love this inspirational quote from Great Sayings. Having been inspired by Vicki's Wild Flowers card, I wanted to use simple pen-drawn lines around the edges with this sentiment...being a calligrapher, I also thought of the "quill" from Asela's set, Nesting. After using the multiliner to make the outline, I subtly shaded inside it with warm grey Copics, then used a mask to faintly stamp the feather with Memento Desert Sand ink and added a few rhinestones in the corner. I am so happy with the way this lets the quote really grab your attention while still bringing some interest to an uncluttered background.

Two years later in a psychology lecture I noticed that a certain boy that had caught my eye throughout my time at university was sitting three rows in front of me. After class, my best friend (who would later be my Maid of Honour at our wedding) pointedly introduced me to him. Thus began my introduction to the Chinese language and the culture of Taiwan, although I had no idea at the time. I was too busy getting lost in his dreamy brown eyes to even think about what I was going to eat for lunch, let alone what the ramifications of falling in love with someone of a different culture would be.

Next question, "What's wrong with your thesis?"
You’ll never convince me that expectations for Ricky Jordan were not at least partially raised because of his last name. And when I say that I am referring to my own expectations for him, specifically as it relates to the acquisition of his baseball cards, which has proven to be a lukewarm investment, gloss surplus aside. If the Phillies organization spent a first round pick on him because they subconsciously thought he was going to mirror Michael Jordan’s accomplishments, but in baseball, or because they thought he was literally related to Michael Jordan as if “Jordan” is not a common last name—I totally did not think/hope that for a little while—then the Phillies are stupid. Ricky Jordan was not Michael Jordan. He was, in actuality, a hybrid of Michael Jordan and Ricky Henderson who was super fast and hit slam dunk home runs and who was awesome but said weird things.
I'm glad the writing is working. But it's at the expense of other pressing concerns I need to resolve, like the fallout of getting sick while no one was around. D and I didn't come through that situation in the best way, and we've wanted to talk about it, but I've been too frayed to do it without getting upset, which D doesn't deal well with. Our attempts to have a conversation about how we handled things on both our ends have been kind of rocky. And then there's the question about what all these seemingly separate problems -- blood sugar, GI tract, kidneys -- are really indicative of. I've pushed that out of my mind for a while, but Labor Day weekend was a reminder that all is not perfectly well and that we still don't have real answers as to why three different body systems decided to get wonky, all starting in the first half of 2009.

I do remember a time when I was in Alaska and my family was the only ones in our branch. We would have a testimony meeting each first Sunday of the month and we were to share our beliefs. Because there were normally only 4 or 5 of us, we would each have the opportunity to share each time. As a teenager, there were times that I did not want to share. But the hard part was; if I was the last one to speak, all of the others would sit there and stare at me until I said something.

I'm very happy here! I'm looking forward to Golden Week (April 29-May 7). I'm headed off for a (relatively cheap) road (train and bus) trip down to Hiroshima and Kyushu. It'll be my first overnighter outside Tokyo, and one of the highest-priority trips in Japan. I'll hit two amusement parks, see two baseball games at different parks, and visit four cities. Thanks to cheap lodging and a bus pass, the trip isn't terribly costly. I'm expecting things to be pretty crowded, though. I'm also planning two other exciting trips this month: Fuji-Q (the "most important" amusement park in Japan for a coaster lover) and my first Japanese baseball game. In fact, April will be quite the busy month for me as I prepare for the trip, work one Sunday overtime, and attend another training session towards the end of the month.

Those were the words I wrote in an email to my husband, Brent, inspired by San Francisco on my first business trip to the city. Several years passed and my passion for the city intensified, eventually spreading deep through Brent as well. We were sick with desire to pick up and start over with the cold fog on our bags. But at the time, we were a newly married couple with mortgage payments and careers firmly fixing us in Raleigh, North Carolina. I've learned in life that when you really want something... I mean, really, deep down inside of you want something, things have a way of working out. In some strange twist of fate, San Francisco opened itself up to us when my company offered me a new position and the opportunity to transfer to the Bay Area. In a matter of a few weeks and many boxes, our house was sold, our cars too... our belongings either packed away in the attics of our family or sold to someone off craigslist.
In this day and age, waiting for anything for more than a few seconds seems ridiculous. The conveniences of our generation have caused us to skim through e-mails, watch only the first few seconds of a video, and DVR TV shows simply so we don’t have to endure another weird Geico commercial. Not saying that there is anything wrong with that, cuz that damn pig does annoy the crap out of me…but sometimes, you have to slow down. Sometimes you have to read the entire e-mail or look through your friends entire Facebook album, otherwise, you miss out on gems that will make your day..maybe even your week. The next picture that you decided not to look at could have been inspiration to do something new. The rest of that e-mail could have contained an “I Love You” that you needed today (unless it’s from a co-worker, then that would just make for an awkward week). The rest of that video could have made you laugh out loud (LOL, 4 all u txtr kds) for real.

Tony Stark/Iron man - Red guy with a brush:
Prohibiting Grass from entering Israel is not only childish, it is also stupid. Rather instead he should be invited to Israel, so he could see for himself how life really is here. Instead we prevented ourselves (or Yishai did) to show him that he is wrong, to instead maybe even cause him to think that he actually is right. If Israel doesn’t have anything to hide (and here I’m not thinking about security matters or the like), then we shouldn’t prevent people from seeing the country and the society, no matter how twisted and wrong their views might be, especially not if that is the case. If they indeed are honest, then they will admit their erroneous views, as for exampel was the case for Nicky Larkin.
CONCLUSION: This was a good drama about life, wanting to live it, seizing the day, not being a loser, and love. You have to get hurt if you want to play the love game — that’s how it works. The two main characters (pot-dealer + shrink-who-smokes-pot) basically become friends and explore their depression together. It’s also a good snapshot of 1994 (pagers, not cellphones). Awkward drug dealer has to explore his first romantic/sexual relationship in the context of his own loserdom. Depressing yet ultimately hopful events ensue.
Some things about writing Sliding on the Edge: I researched until I was buried in notes about self-abuse and suicide. I learned a lot that I hadn't expected to learn, and since learning new stuff is always exciting, this experience whetted my appetite to continue doing something that required research and organizing that research within a story so it was "enjoyable." (Whew! Long sentence.) Another interesting thing: I was surprised when readers asked me about my own self-abuse. That was really a surprise to discover that people thought I'd written from personal experience.

In the evening I had a wonderful Amherst dinner reunion with A, M, K, G, and M. And I finally got to meet E! Pretty impressive - four of the six of senior year room group in the same spot. E spent the entire dinner flirting with the tables around us. She was very well behaved for being so young and at a big-person restaurant. I read a bit and went to bed early. Big race in the morning!

We had a GREAT night. Got to trick or treat for about 1 hour. That was plenty of time for the kids to get a TON of candy and for us to see a bunch of our friends along the way too. We then took all the candy and donated it to Connor's school to help kids in South America have stocking stuffers for Christmas. What a great idea and a way to get all that candy OUT of my house!!! :)

The detention provisions under NDAA authorize this and any future president to order the military to pick up and indefinitely imprison civilians captured anywhere in the world, far from any battlefield, not because they were convicted of a crime based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but in fact without criminal charges or courtroom trials, based on suspicion alone. Even where there is no armed conflict and no threat to Americans. For the first time in American history, indefinite military detention without charge or trial is lawful.
So, I texted Captain America to tell him to text me the Duty number, and waited. My friend from church, Heather Shoaf, came over to visit, and we were gonna work on a "flyer" for her for work.

All My Friends... is McMurtry's sixth book, but it has the easy flowing, autobiographical feel of a younger work. Our hero is Rice student and aspiring author, Danny Deck. On a spur-of-the-moment trip to Austin, Danny wakes up on a floor next to the beautiful (and super tall) Sally, and instantly falls in love with her. He steals her away from her drunken professor lover and takes her back to Houston where they decide they might as well get married. Sally doesn't really like any of Danny's friends, or even Danny, all that much, and the two of them mostly have sex and sit around silently. Things change for Danny when he finds that his first novel is going to be published, and that Hollywood is interested in making a movie version. Flush with cash, the book turns into a road trip when Sally and Danny leave behind Danny's sultry neighbor and motherly friend and head to San Francisco where their relationship falls even further apart at the same rate that Sally's pregnant belly grows. Things go down and up and down again and end up back in Texas. Because how could you not go back?

This awakening requires a certain dedication to the establishment and maintenance of inner silence. The extent to which we are able to achieve silence and the resulting inner stillness determines the extent to which we can open to the ‘higher mind’ — beyond the thinking mind.

A good example is someone who complains and complains about the nature of their relationship because it is not a good fit, and says they want something else, but ends up staying in the same relationship “until something better comes along”. This is not a serious bid for power for a new relationship and certainly not the way spirit works. This example is showing an action that the universe reads as a commitment and therefore will not provide another “better relationship” to take its place while the action shows a commitment to the current one. So this person may think they are bidding to change their circumstance but as long as they stay in the current relationship they are not serious about the change. If you are truly committed to changing your relationship dynamics you must show you are serious by becoming conscious about the ways you are showing commitment to the things you say you do not want.

The cemetery dates back to the mid-1930′s and is the creation of the local folk artist Stan Ioan Patras, sculptor, painter and poet rolled in one. Patras used all his skills to create colourful tombstones with naïve paintings describing, in an original and poetic manner, the persons that are buried there as well as scenes from their lives.
Dan Ryan and I met in broadcasting school of all places. We were energetic students who had a huge desire for radio, and a disdain for television production and it showed. When I first met Dan the first thing I noticed was for his ability to cut through a room with only his voice. I mean you could hear it down the hall. He and I collaborated quite a bit through the radio program at school, and after school he moved away. Not too long ago through FaceBook, we reconnected and ever since, he has been a part of the show. His Hollywood Spin this next season is going to blow away anyone else's ability to report on the entertainment industry.

In this series of parable-like sayings in John 15, Jesus describes God as the owner of a vineyard in which Jesus himself is the vine and his disciples are the branches. This is a vivid image for the relationship of Jesus and his disciples as well as the on-going relationship of Jesus to his disciples in all ages. We will see in these verses Jesus’ intimate relationship with his disciples will result in both friendship with Jesus, but also enmity with the world.

It can be difficult to find the right housing accommodations for persons with disabilities and establishing what type of services one might need can be stressful.

Hypnobirthing and waterbirthing would fit well together, if we had the opportunity. In our classes, we learned yet another statistic: as it turns out, only 12% of first-time-moms wanting a waterbirth actually achieve it (for a variety of reasons I won’t go into here). My first reaction was to respond to that with determination…”Hmph! I will be one of the 12%! I STILL want a waterbirth!” Time to stack the odds in our favor. We couldn’t depend on our current medical provider to be available for waterbirth (we actually never even met that “one” doctor) so it was time to think about a change. Dawn opened up the discussion on a midwife, which, quite frankly, I hadn’t even given a single thought. She also informed us that there were a variety of other hospitals in the Metro equipped for waterbirth. Enter Maple Grove Hospital and North Metro Midwives! I can’t even convey here how INSTANTLY at ease we were after our first visit to a midwife. Oh my goodness! These people actually have a similar belief system to ours! They embraced our birth plan, encouraged us to proceed with our wishes, and promised to do everything in their power to make it happen. We had the opportunity to meet all 3 midwives in the practice, despite the fact that we didn’t switch to their clinic until I was about 30 weeks along. Although we didn’t know who would deliver our baby, waterbirth was available regardless, and we felt extremely comfortable with all three of these wonderful women.
To us, freedom as a concept is fairly simple: we should be able to choose, within the limits of safety and common respect for others, the activities in which we participate and the way in which we participate in them. Through the exercise of this freedom, we can learn for ourselves what works for us and does not work for us, and eventually develop the confidence and comfort to pursue our passions that only comes with trial and error - and eventual success.
This particular day was a Monday!.. Mondays in rural France are quiet days.. Shop closed days!. I knew this. I had been warned. A helpful notice posted in the cottage was there to remind me, and even with a verbal reminder from Sharon I still managed to overlook the fact I was about to run out of milk and on a Monday no less!!! So determined to rectify my silly lapse of brain cells, I took off on an adventure.

It's a great way to try new toppings that you wouldn't normally try. We're having olives, capers, red onion, roasted pine nuts, and sultanas on our pizza. I'd never have thought to put those things together on a pizza, but it's delicious! :)

When a major corporation donates money to a political campaign (remember almost all major corporations are government owned through collective investments), this is actually a loophole around campaign finance laws, as this is really just the government donating money to its own candidate or party through its collective-investment-owned “private” corporations. This is hard to swallow, but true as the nose on your face! For it was the banks who received the recent bailouts that were the largest campaign contributors to Barack Obama’s presidential campaign – in a big way. When you hear that all of these elites sit on each other’s boards of directors, that’s only a half-truth.

Petunia couldn’t believe it. Not only did she get to model Mr. Forquet’s dress in Italy, but at a lavish dinner for eighteen at La Cisterna, one of Rome’s swankiest restaurants.

Until, that is, her neighbour had confided to her over dessert (and a glass or six of chianti): the Vogue Patterns team had rather a lot of budget to use up before the end of the financial year.

Well, Isabel and Ryan’s beloved Grams made her way to town this past Thursday and we wasted no time keeping her entertained. We jetted off that night to bowl with my co-workers. They’re a fun, sociable group that plans lots of these outings. Usually I can’t go with the kids on my own, but with a second set of hands available to corral the kids, I finally got to join in on the fun. Luckily our group had the foresight (and by foresight, I mean there were no other lanes available so they got stuck with the end ones) to get the lanes on the end right by the arcade area. I say luckily because Isabel could run around over there and I could see her from the lanes pretty easily and just check on her occasionally without having to drag her back for me to bowl.

The brass fanfare heard about 35 seconds into this track is one that would stop anyone in their tracks.

And that’s the key. Though we as Christians know that our lives here on earth are but a tiny speck in the unending, incomprehensible enormity and joy of eternity, we are still trapped in these temporal, decaying bodies. If we don’t stay vigilant and focused, our everyday existence will overwhelm the reality of what lies ahead. Today then becomes the measuring stick of our lives, and somehow we all come up short. The “twilight we longed for” bears little resemblance to the actual final years of our life on earth, and that can prove to be a great tragedy.

Starter #3: Papas Canarias - salty wrinkled potatoes with mojo verde ($8 on regular menu). This one got mixed reviews - the potatoes themselves looked adorable - like chocolate nuggets rolled in powdered sugar - and tasted AMAZING, served at just the right temperature to bring out its natural flavor, with a perfectly crisped outer layer embellished with a kick of salt. The unfortunate part was the mojo verde dip, which was much too salty for all four of us. We would have loved to report layers of flavor unfolding with the heat of the potato, but we couldn't taste much beyond the salt.

At that time the vaShawasha heard that Pasipamire, the medium of Chaminuka, had been taken to Bulawayo by the Matabele and killed there. They went to take all the treasure which was left by Pasipamire; cattle, sheep and goats, because Pasipamire was their friend. Those who went to take that treasure were: Nyava, Mafusire, Guzha, Gutu, Mashonganyika. They shared the treasure among all the vaShawasha. In the same year it mild not rain in Chishawasha. There was a famine. Chief Seke of Harava (his mutupo was mava zuruvi), had taken also the cattle of Chaminuka. There came starvation in his country too in that year. In Chishawasha there was a man called Kaguvi of the tribe of Rozvi and he was the brother of Pasipamire. Kaguvi explained to the people of Chishawasha and to the people of Seke saying, “This starvation which has come to your countries was brought by Chaminuka whose treasure you have taken, I have heard the voice of Kid coming from a rock saying, ” ‘You must pay back the cattle of Chaminuka’!” When the vaShawasha heard this they refused because among them there was no medium of mhondoro. Kaguvi told them to give two cattle to Nehanda but they refused.

Yet if the intention of the interim government’s leaders is to project an image that their government is above politics, the appointments have not been received that way – the Malian press reports objections to the new government’s composition from both pro- and anti-coup political factions (French), and says that the process of forming the government has brought Diarra (French) face to face with “the reality of public life.” Assembling a government without including members of major political parties is a deeply political decision, one that could alienate people whose support the interim government might want.
Magic erasers really are... magic. Any grime that you sit there and scrub at for hours will come off in two swipes and it really take the age off of tile and refrigerators and makes it look and feel like new.
She left a few days ago to go back to Australia, having visited family and friends, including moi. I hadn't seen her in 14 years. We kept in contact through Facebook, the occasional email and word-of-mouth from other friends. But, as we agreed to meet up at the corner of Bay and Bloor for a Friday night of cocktails and catch-up, I was nervous. What if we, now 14 years later, had nothing in common. We hadn't really communicated that much in the 14 years she'd been in Australia. We'd gone from a friendship of hanging out every weekend to almost no or little contact.
Kinner, raised to be docile and not trained in battle because he is a man, does not emerge as a hero in the war between the corrupt queen and her discontented subjects that provides much of the action in the novel. (Many of the subjects are miffed that the queen keeps stealing their husbands in pursuit of an heir.) In this way, the story is realistic, unlike anachronistic Hollywood films that cast every other ancient or medieval heroine as a Boudica, rather than portraying them within the context of their time, where courage did not necessarily manifest itself in dazzling swordplay.

My, oh, my! It's been quite a while. Unpacking and organizing, rearranging and reorganizing has been the name of the game here at the Weed residence. For the first time in at least 2 moves, we opened every single box. Those boxes with multiple moving company stickers, like unopened treasures from long ago, were opened this time. And can I just say "Yuck!". It is simply amazing the amount of unnecessary junk that one family can hang onto and cart all over the planet. Much of what we found ended up in the shredder or garbage pile. And I asked on several occasions, "do we really need bank statements from 1998? or college papers from 1995?" Seriously!? It feels great to be cleaned out. Great! Should have done it a few moves ago! Clutter reduction is a plus. Makes you just feel lighter to get rid of unneeded stuff that's taking up space. I love it!

As if the burger wasn’t enough to fill me up, I decided to try out their Mint Brownie Shake for $3.99 – if you want, you can also upsize it for an extra $1 and get the tin refill container. I remember when all of their shakes came with the tin refill container but I guess prices have gone up over the years.

Another thing I came away with was my blood test results. I had this done a few months ago. A complete work over. I was told that I would only hear from the office if there was a problem. There was no call - so I thought, great! And there really wasn't a problem in the whole scheme of things - not enough to have them flag it as an immediate danger. It does seem though that I have a small vitamin D deficiency which can be remedied by taking a supplement and drinking a good milk. The milk should be high in calcium and vitamin D. I went right down and got some and next I have to purchase the tablets. All my other blood-work - lipids, all the vitamins, blood sugars, heart disease risk, cholesterol etc etc - were all smack in the middle or under the limit. UNDER the limit... whooo. I was stoked. I was told, given one of my sons having Type One diabetes, had I stayed the weight I was all this time later - I probably would have developed type 2 diabetes. As it stands now I have little chance of this happening because of the weight loss. Such great news. My cholesterol should be between 5 and 6 (but Doc Hill told me most Australians sit between 6 and 7 and thats still fairly healthy). Mine was 3.3. Thats just one example. Nice to know I'm healthy. Really healthy. He also told me I'm doing great at maintaining my weight. I have actually lost 2 and half kilos (around 5 pounds) since I saw him last. I was happy with that lol.

This is the wall where the paint will be going. Sometimes I rush things. I know that about me - I'm impatient. A lot of the times I just want to see results and since, like many others, I have a very limited amount of time that I can work on projects they drag out forever, so I do things before I should. I'm pretty sure I should have primed all that sheet rock spackle that I mentioned here (in fact, that's what I read on the spackle container...after I had already painted over it...oops!).

My mother read this YA historical gem aloud to me when I was about eight, and I read it over and over – the story of a bright young Royalist girl during the English Civil War who runs away from her harsh Puritan cousins, and ends up joining forces with a lanky charming spy for Charles II. It's chock-a-block with wit, romance, and adventure, a perfect historically-accurate-but-not-too-gory novel for a young audience. I still read this one; the sparkling characters and hysterically witty prose hold up well for an adult reader looking back over childhood favorites.

Normally this wouldn't be a strange thing, but I was driving on a highway going about 65 mph, so, I couldn't believe the dove was able to stay on the windshield without being blown off. Maybe that's normal or not strange at all, but, at that moment, I felt a sense of calm come over me that I'd never experienced before. I decided from then on, whenever I would see a dove, that was my way of knowing that my dad was still with me in spirit, watching over me. Maybe it's silly, but I guess when we lose those closest to us, we do these things to make ourselves feel better or ease our pain a little.
I’m just grateful for blaine & boz (despite the fact that boz has caused a couple of the panic attacks himself…long story)…because if i didn’t have them i’d feel COMPLETELY alone, because i kinda am, and that really hurts (but ya know, story of my life)…I’m always there to listen, to help, to care, but when i need someone, theres rarely anyone there for me (probably why i have so many people in my head, i needed SOMEONE to talk to, so i gave myself many someones, a someone for every situation, and i’d never be lonely again…or so i thought…you’d be surprised how lonely one can be when standing in a crowded room)….

Week 1 at Arizona: The ‘Hawks open the season playing the Arizona Cardinals for a consecutive game as they played them on last season’s finale. The home team was the victor in both games last year as Seattle held on in their home opener to beat the Cards 13-10. The season finale became a battle as both teams made late runs and eyed 8-8 record and second place in the division. Arizona prevailed in an overtime nail-biter 23-20. This early NFC West matchup should be a good indicator of who is hoping to give the division favorite 49ers a run for their money.

Camassia is a genus of six species native to western North America, from southern British Columbia to northern California, and east to Utah, Wyoming and Montana. Historically, the genus was thought to belong to the lily family (Liliaceae), sometimes narrowed down to the families Scillaceae or Hyacinthaceae, but DNA and biochemical studies have led the APG II-group to reassign Camassia to the family Agavaceae. Common names include Camas, Quamash, Indian hyacinth, and Wild hyacinth.

The simple truth: Your hyper stimulated brain never needs to rest: Go, Go, Go all the time! Problem is: You have this thing called “Your Body” and your body secretly hates your brain and every thing your brain does to it. Is it too much to ask to listen to your body for one day? Luckily for you dear peeps we have a “Body” and a “Brain” on retainer here at CultFit HQ…Here is a recent conversation we overheard in the bathroom three stalls over:
After days of decorating and cooking---well, of course, you understand, MamaCoyote gets all of that credit. Papa tries to lend a paw when appropriate, but, well, I just am not much of a decorator. We had twenty-eight family members coming for dinner and dad gum it all, MamaCoyote was in full enteraining mode. Having eleven kids eleven and under made the day all the more exciting. We even had three nursing mothers in the house all nursing babies several times a day. I could never see what all the fuss is about with mothers nursing in public because there just is nothing to see unless one would rush in and jerk up a blouse or sweater. If one were to do that, then he/she should be arrested. As I type this I am hacking and coughing. I started coming down with a miserable cold the day we left for McCall for some rest and relaxation. Well, that is about all I did. Rest, and well, can't say much for the relaxation part. First time in all the years that we have gone to McCall that I did not XC ski, but did get a couple books read and many FB games watched. Yearn for the old days when there were only four bowl games and they were all played on New Year's Day. What was for dinner? Lots!! Everybody brings some part of the dinner so you know how that goes. Lots of tasty stuff. MamaCoyote cooked a huge prime rib to perfection and included roasted chicken and ham. We had squash pie which we call pumpkin pie. Psst: Don't tell John. No one had a chance of going home hungry.

At a time when Schoenberg and Stravinsky were thought of as opposite poles, Roberto Gerhard was combining the density of the one with the dynamism of the other in a wholly personal synthesis. You can hear this in the Piano Concerto's mood swings from the dark and brooding to, in the finale, a Spanish take-off that Chabrier would have thought off the wall. Gerhard's 1960s music is in-your-face modernism that holds you in its grasp, embracing sound with an enthusiasm that remains inspirational today.

So far I've been using Diaper Rite bleached flats in size large and Koala Kuddles Muslin receiving blankets as flats. The Diaper Rite flats, from my measurements, are 36" x 27" stretched. The original measurements for the Diaper Rite's was 32" x 32". I don't know how I ended up with the wonky measurement of 36" x 27". I measured twice and measured 2 different flats! Strange. Perhaps because I'm hanging them to dry it's causing the fabric to stretch by weighing it down on the line. The corners of the flats do look stretched out (which makes folded them neatly slightly more complicated). The Koala Kuddles are 42" x 42" stretched. The original measurement for these was 39" x 39". Again, I think that fact that I'm line drying everything has lead to the stretching of the fabric (especially at the corners). The lack of the daily high heat drying experience is probably the cause of the differing measurements.
#4 thought:
It’s not just the case that the second method can look a lot like the first – on top of that, people who claim to be using psychic powers often really seem like they’re doing tricks. Uri Geller may be a good example of this (depending on whether he’s calling what he does “magic” or “mystificationalism” today). This video seems to show him simply bending a spoon while people are distracted from looking at it directly, as well as providing supportive evidence that his broken spoons look like they’ve been bent repeatedly.

A mystery KAL is when a designer has a pattern and welcomes others to join her in a knit-a-long, but the mystery part is that only part of the pattern is released at a time. So this means you’re knitting from a new pattern and will have to trust completely that you’ll like the end result. Usually, every week or two a new “clue” is released. As the knitter, you’re supposed to knit to the end of the clue and stop, waiting anxiously for the next clue to be released. It’s actually a great way to get a lot of projects for a new design. Sometimes the pattern is tested ahead of time, and other times, not.

So my Paleo friends and I have been getting together as much as possible to share recipes, wine, and a good company during the work week. This past week was my turn, and being that my BFF’s wonderful Hubby is a professional chef, I knew I had to impress him with a flavorful meal that he would enjoy. I started trollin’ the internet for tasty Paleo recipes and came upon one from this blog: http://stiritup.me/?p=2102 .

Something similar: The Hollow Kingdom by Claire B. Dunkle is another slightly chilling read with some unconvential romance.

He'd call me in the middle of day. Ask me if I wanted to “get a coffee.” I'd play along and say, “Sure, why not.” He'd jump on a train at NYU, and I'd meet him at my Starbucks. We'd walk back to my place. Fuck from the instant we walked in the door. And then he'd go back to his library carrel on the 5th floor. I'd edit another twenty or so pages, email it to him. Or he'd call and say, “I'm done, you want to get a drink,” which like coffee, was code for fucking, but more insistent. That was my cue to hop in a cab, and meet him in the WestVillage. But also kind of hating him and myself the whole time.
I don’t think it is so far fetched to think that my life is so interesting that my daily activities should be posted to an anonymous gossip website. Gossip girl gave me hope that going to school, dealing with family drama, and hanging out my friends was truly gossip worthy. Not just gossip worthy, but when people see me out and about, they will send in anonymous tips to some all-knowing gossip fiend. So much so that it makes me feel like a celebrity. FALSE. Even when I tried my hardest to live my life in a gossip worthy manner, my life did not show up on people’s news feeds. Thanks Gossip Girl for giving me false hope that I could be as notorious as the upper East side elite.

Scenario such as the following have happened to both myself and to those around me more than once and while the specific people and sins are irrelevant, the reaction of the people involved is not. Pulling from these experiences, there is a sin or perception of a sin that occurs and word gets out (This is why God does not like gossip). In my experience this is how people respond:

Following the port shut down some anarchistic youth and squatters attempted to seize a vacant homeless facility to bring it back to the service of the homeless. This exemplary action challenges the irrationality of capitalism, which allows housing to remain vacant while people are driven out of their homes and onto the streets. This type of movement is essential and should have the support of labor and the communities of the oppressed. It is for that reason that we are convinced the so-called vandals are not real anarchists but are provocateurs and the young and naive easily swayed by these seemingly radical actions. Was the fire which was lit in the street and the window which were broken done by cops dressed as “black blockers” to assure the storm troops had excuse to crush the squatters. These outbursts of violence do nothing to organize the working class and prepare for the seizure of power and are therefore just as counter-revolutionary as the non program/program of the liberals and reformists.

But there’s a problem here. Because the ’art’ that Bioware made is an art that was meant to be sold, to a lot of people. There was a large marketing budget involved. They wanted you to buy the game ie: hand over $60+ for this story. People bought, based on trust and sight unseen, a product. They were trading on a promise of a certain level of storytelling and involvement that they’d come to expect based on past performance. That money was used to make the game better (or even to make the game. I’m not entirely sure about the workings of video game funding). Consumers have certain expectations when buying a product; they are less inclined to have stringent expectations when buying art. So is the game art or is it a product? Or is it both/neither?

I didn't tare so I feel like I don't really have much healing to do. I'm home already and happy to be with my husband and two girls.
Naik responded by first addressing John 14:6 and 9. He claimed that one should look at the immediate context of John 14:6, beginning at verse 1, where Jesus mentions that there are many mansions in his Father’s house and that he goes to prepare a place for his followers. Jesus tells his followers that they know the way to where he is going which leads Thomas to respond that they do not know where Jesus is going and therefore don’t know the way. We pick it up from there,

It’s interesting how some of the same people who complain about how prostitution is so degrading are promoting degrading attitudes against us themselves.
BPA is an acronym for Bisphenol-A and it has been in use for more than six decades, tested hundreds of times, and never found to post a threat to health, but rather as an essential packaging element to protect it.
Each one of us knows someone who is a “go-to” guy or gal. These are the people in our offices, homes, families and other organizations that we know we can go to in order to get something accomplished or a problem solved. It seems that these people know where to find the answers, the equipment or have sound advice. We usually hold this person in high regard with great respect. In some cases, we may be the go-to person.
Goblins are also a good stunty team. Sure, trolls are not as strong as treemen, but they can have two of them, could have Ripper the star troll for a third Big Guy, and can have (with star players) up to 2 chainsaws, 2 ball & chains, 2 Bombers... yikes!

1) Learn to honour the value and not the cost: Amy says that this means stopping to consider whether or not an item fills a legitimate need or whether you’re only thinking about buying an item because it’s inexpensive. “Put an end to the super size, the more is better mentality and you’re off to a good start,” she says.
Just to add to the confusion, if you write/illustrate picture books a dummy is something else. It is a mock-up of the finished book as you see it, with rough illustrations and text in place. It may be the right size, but it need not be. The point of the dummy is to show the editor the arrangement of pictures and text that you envisage. It's much easier to do with a dummy than by describing it. To make it, you make copies of your illustrations and print out the text (or scan in and add the text in Quark or whatever) and paste them onto pieces of paper. You can glue or stitch them into a book or leave them as loose pages as you wish. Loose pages are easier for the editor to photocopy for acquisitions meetings, but a bound dummy can give a better idea of what the book will be like. I'm not going to go into great detail about how to make a dummy as you can find out here and I want some breakfast now.
For there to be true hope in the face of suffering, there must be a chance for healing. Cure can be temporary. Healing is eternal. Suffering can take many forms. Sickness, disease, poverty, hunger, despair, loneliness. It is all suffering. It is all pain. In the midst of suffering, hope can seem very far away. There are many times in life when cure and healing seem to overlap. If you are hungry, the cure is food. If you are sick, a cure is health. Yet seeking cure is sometimes treating a symptom.
At one point a couple years ago I think people started getting wise to the scam, so he had to dial it down a little and ask them to kill less stuff. Seriously, there was a point when he would send people all over the place killing 30 of like…everything out there. After a while he cut that down to like a dozen, just to make sure he didn’t totally lose his supply of takers. Still, it’s pretty funny to watch the fuckers eat it up even now.

Academic publishers were amongst the closest connected to their customers in that their stable of authors taught their cohort of customers. They were proactive in direct mail campaigns and in seeking adoptions from academics, but for the general trade, contact with the end user was almost non-existent. Not only did publishers avoid contact with customers – but if at all possible they avoided booksellers too. I remember being speechless when suggesting to a member of the IPG Board in 2001 that we hold a joint meeting for members of the IPG and the Booksellers Association and being told: “Oh I really don’t think we have enough in common to run a meeting together”. Fortunately things have moved on rapidly since and the same thing would not happen now – but it is indicative of how very far removed some publishers became from their customers.

There will be no beating around the bush in this mystery novel. A victim, a detective and a suspect. What more do you need? No quirky characters. No digressions about dog show politics or the history of Irish pub goers. Just a crime and a detective trying to solve it. If you want to learn a how to prepare southern cuisine, buy a cookbook. The subject here is murder.
After the victim ends a relationship with a psychopath, this behavior is likely to escalate into downright stalking. This happens for the reasons I have explained in previous articles:

Convert is a pretty, bare-bones shop with windows filled with utilitarian Moxsie-esque goodies like Toms Shoes and recycled fabric knapsacks. It reminded me of the small warehouse-style boutiques I saw in Japan that seem to be taking hold here, all white walls with a couple of minimalist racks and long, industrial tables in the middle of the room. (Maybe I just haven't been shopping in a while, we are in a recession, after all.) The men's clothes at Convert are far more practical than the women's, so my father was lucky in his shopping endeavors: three shirts, one sweater. Disappointed in their weird, batwing-y ladies' selection, I strolled over to the shoe section to see if Jeanne was right about those weird Tom's shoes (cushioned, but stinky!).

Even though they are both on my “If I win the lottery” list and of equal lust factor, for me personally, I prefer the Kelly a tiny bit more than the Birkin. I love the classy, serious shape and more structured design of the Kelly whereas the Birkin is more of a fun, softer design to me.

In the above image, we see two photos of the Crab nebula, a supernova which occurred in 1054 A.D. The image on the left we see the outer layers blown off from the explosion in visible light. The image on the right shows the area around the central neutron star as seen in X-rays. The neutron star is strongly affecting the hot gases surrounding it. This is because in the process of collapsing down from a Sun-sized object to a city-sized object, two interesting things happen:

As long as I remember, but I only really started trying seriously a few years ago. I think the best way to improve your writing is just to read a huge amount. Look at the writers you love and see how they compose their stories. When I was writing Haywired, I had Mortal Engines by Philip Reeve and Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents next to me. After I had written a chapter or two, I would read from these books and compare them to Haywired

SO..did any of you get engaged on the 29th February!?!? Were any of you brave enough to ask your partners to marry you!?? We didn't have any engagements at the Towers although not for the want of trying.......Tammy was up to her usual antics and her whip is legendary in the local village so it made for a very entertaining end to February!!
I would also ask: if one unilaterally rejects self-harm, how then can Tumblr accept blogs on BDSM, particularly those that “glorify” masochism? BDSM is no less controversial than cutting, anorexia, or bulimia. I was once referred for psychiatric evaluation when I said I enjoyed being whipped. Because I consent to this, it is “self-harm.”
There will be many of you, like me, who look at the vast, gaping hole in the ‘relevant experience’ part on your graduate applications and feel like crying. In my darker moments, I wonder why any employer would pick the girl from the coffee shop over the girl who has done one million internships. Well, I’m about to tell you.
When I got a little time out of my really busy schedule at work, I went to get myself a cup of tea from the pantry which is connected into a tiny balcony area that overlooks a ground. The view I had wasn’t exactly the most beautiful view but I did see something that drew my attention. I could see an old man had walked into the ground with two stray dogs following him. When he’d finished his job on that ground he started to walk toward the gate of the ground. That’s when one of the two dogs spotted him walk out so he followed him. The man held the gate open for that one and locked the gate behind them. The second dog didn’t see this man walk out cause he was peeing in the bush and when he heard the gate close he went running towards it, hoping he would make it in time but Alas! The gate was now latched with no sign of getting out. He whined and tried to get out between the metal railings of the gate but he did not fit so he just sat by the gate and awaited his freedom.

Today was a good day. It is Satruday and this means that I am not working, and I still have another day free before returning to work on Monday. Currently, I am a graduate accountant at a small accounting firm in town. Soon, this will not be the case. Among other happenings in my life right now, working at this firm has been hell. My boss, Dee, is an emotional wreck and oftentimes will take out her unhappiness and depression on those around here, and since we are a small firm, that usually happens to be me or our senior accountant (there are only three accountants in the firm at this current time).

(Yea, I was even a nerd at birth. Live long and prosper yo!) Oddly enough, I think K is right in the middle. He definitely has his daddy’s nose and mouth, but he has my face shape and eyes. That makes me feel pretty good. I didn’t think he’d have many pieces of me and that I’d just be dubbed The Lady That Feeds Me Whenever I Please. But now, it’s pretty obvious that he’s made up of parts of me.

I found it astonishing to see how much Gabriel had changed since the first book. He is a lot more expressive and feels things more deeply now. There's a scene in the END OF DAYS where Gabriel comes to the rescue in a sense and that tugged on my heart strings. His development has been extraordinary to watch, he has grown in strength from the first time we met him. I'm hoping for only good things to come for him.

If you're a regular reader you know that I firmly believe in holistic living. A healthy diet free of additives and a healthy life lived as chemical free as possible is, in my view, the key to longevity and health. As part of that, and including my struggles with hormone imbalances in the past, I focused on also having my cosmetics be as natural and as gentle as possible. Therefore, I've been a loyal user of the Toronto brand Pure+Simple for years now. Their gentle, organic, and natural cosmetics have served my sensitive and abused *I am an actor after all and have to often wear a lot of make-up* skin very well. Today, I have an quick interview with the creator and founder of Pure+Simple, Kristen Ma. Enjoy!
The arrival of the Master coincided with their emergence from the gestalt state when the radiation effects had subsided, and his influence caused the emergence of a split personality of good and evil, each side competing for their tremendous power while yearning to become a proper species once again. The Master, who was stranded on Earth at the time too, succeeded in capturing the Xeraphin as a new power source for his TARDIS. However, the Doctor's intervention meant his nemesis' TARDIS was sent to Xeriphas where events became out of his control.

Recently I was doing a guest star on ‘Rizzoli & Isles’ where I was playing this hot-shot young lawyer and daughter of a business man played by legendary filmmaker Peter Bogdanovich. It was a really rushed job, so when I arrived on the set I didn’t know who he was exactly when I met him (although his signature glasses looked familiar). I was kind of shy that day and when I got home, I checked to see and sure enough and quite synchronistically I had watched ‘The Last Picture Show’ the night before working and didn’t even realize with whom I was working with!! OMG – a missed opportunity and lesson to always do my homework.

He reiterated his charges in an interview with the Mail & Guardian this week, saying: “Every time we talk about the judges we are accused of attacking the judiciary. But what do you do when the judiciary goes public on something that they should be dealing with in their own internal processes ... and actually creating a hullabaloo around that issue? “We are saying that this is a psychological preparation of society for their (the judges) pouncing. The issue there is not Hlophe ... it’s Zuma.

Until then, this is home decor worthy. You could decorate a little girl's room with it, or a wedding reception with several, we used it for a baby girl shower. If you are decorating with it, I would mod podge the layers together rather than just spray glue, to make it more durable, but it's pretty sturdy.
NATO and its allies were aiming at regime change und a take-over of the most profitable pieces of the Libyan economy. After these aims would have been fulfilled, a post-war effort was intended to bring to trial and to sentence the leaders of the old regime for genocide and “crimes against humanity” and thereby get the exclusive power of definition over the historic process. The International Criminal Court in Den Haag started with this procedure to hegemonise memory on the 27th of June 2011, in the middle of the war. With the killing of Muammar al-Gaddafi this last piece of memory-control maybe failed. It stays unclear whether this was intended by the USA and its allies, because Gaddafi knew too much on international relations, or whether this was due to the “the ground-forces” who were not disciplined enough to act according to this agenda.

Another thought...a light went out when Robert Brault retired from posting his original quotes today. I thought how good it would be to categorise all of his quotes as an easy personal reference...it's something I've wanted to do for such a long time as I can never find the quote I need when I needed it most. Actually, perhaps I should first seek permission before I fall foul of copyright restrictions.
It's still in its box - and typical of these times - there were add-ons I needed. The extra battery. The camera case. The suitably fast memory card. The extended insurance. I baulked at the idea of an extra lens. Anyway, the baby has arrived and now I have the challenge of coming to terms with the technical wizardry that will be at my fingertips if I can only figure out how to exploit it. Who knows - maybe tomorrow I'll snap some daffodils if the grassy bank I am thinking of is in full bloom. We'll see. Gonna call the baby Cyclops because it only has one eye.

I always remember a conversation that I had with my mother-in-law, some time ago. I was telling her that I had a list of jobs waiting to be done on a rainy day. She said that they would not get done because it would not be the right sort of rain. I had never heard this before and assume that it must be an Irish idiom as both of my mother-in-law's parents were from Ireland. But she was quite right, it never is the right sort of rain. This afternoon it was grey, miserable and cold and looked very much like rain. Ignoring the Spring cleaning, ironing, sewing, letter writing and blogging that could all be done in the dry and warm I went down to the greenhouse to sow the last of my seeds and to do the final round of the pricking out. I shall need to do some potting on but not a lot is happening in the greenhouse at the moment. The weather is too cold and wet. The plants and seedlings need more warmth and light which means sun. Not all of this rain, more of which fell whilst I was in the greenhouse. The water butts connected to the greenhouse guttering are probably the only things enjoying all of this wet weather. They are full to over flowing.

I learnt something whilst making these; cranberries have a lot of sugar, even more than sultana’s. Having them in biscuits such as these is all good and doesn’t worry me. But whilst I was cooking Miss F was eating these by the handful as I thought they would be fine. But 30mins later I had an absolute nightmare on my hands. Miss F changes to a completely different person if she eats too much sugar; she’s a real little terror. So lesson learned there!
Dyke was far more diplomatic in his post-match autopsy. He reminded us that Bishopstoke did contest last season in the Southampton Premier Division, which is one level higher than us - albeit that their season culminated in a last place finish. It's not entirely clear why they haven't been relegated, although that was besides the point. Next Saturday's pre-season fixture has been cancelled, which may well be a blessing in disguise - although before that we have a game with Hedge-End Rangers Reserves on Wednesday evening.

Dylan's hirschsprungs journey has never been easy, although we are lucky it has went as well as it has. Theres so many kids out there that struggle alot worse, so I am more than thankful that God has let us have "the easy road" compared to some. I cant complain, we will just work at it until we get it. Dylans 4th birthday is coming up, and I cannot believe how time flies. My little boy is turning into a big boy and will soon start preschool which will be a whole new chapter, and hopefully we can get him potty trained by then, and if not then, well we will pray that he ends up with an understanding teacher that has a big heart. So, to the rest of you Hirschsprungs mommies out there...stay strong, and take it one day at a time...Things will slowly look up, when things seem hard, just remember, things could be worse, we still have our precious children after all, some havent been so blessed. So always count your blessings...the few, the better, just be thankful.

You could easily fit another seven sets of dice in the bag with room to spare, which is dangerous because it forces you to confront the question, “How many dice are too many dice?” I’ve yet to find an answer that results in me feeling content with the number of dice that I own. That is the one of the few bits of caution I have for someone thinking about buying a Dragon Chow Dice Bag!
Mann has documented her children’s childhood through her camera. The moments she captures of her three children are not always the typical image you would find in a family album; however in my opinion you can clearly tell that these are her children. These photographs include shots of her children doing everyday activities – dressing up, swimming naked in the lake, getting hurt, painting their bodies and playing together, or simply just gazing into the camera. However while I myself see these photographs as beautiful, tender moments captured by a mother who see’s all that is being photographed every day, others believed this was child pornography and this caused a great deal of controversy about her work.
