Specialty: The signature drink at the Trop is the Captain Morgan Blue Storm, a drink that you'll easily recognize, as it's served in a large, plastic "yard" with the Rays logo on it. The cocktail consists of Captain Morgan Lime Bite, blue curaçao and lemonade. If you're not afraid to walk around holding a bright blue cocktail in a comically-oversized vessel, give it a shot — it's light, fruity and refreshing.

Was it distracting that the actor was of a different ethnicity than the character he was playing? Sure. But then would it have been even more distracting for an uncoordinated, lily-white British kid to pass as a dancing phenomenon? Most likely. At least, that's how the producers of the show must feel.
Sarkozy's foreign minister, Alain Juppe, has raised the possibility of France pushing for a Security Council resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N.

"History," explain Dick Armey and Matt Kibbe, "teaches us that nothing could be more American than protest." In this book, they connect that spirit of protest with the "tea party" movement, which Kibbe (chief executive of the smaller government advocacy group FreedomWorks) defines as being "built on a coherent, unifying set of values … that go back to the revolutionary traditions of our founding as a nation." He and Armey, former House Republican majority leader, include a "toolkit" of guidelines showing readers how to organize activists in their own communities. "Remember," they write,"we are following the tradition of the original American community organizers, the Sons of Liberty.… As they understood so well, it does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen to set brush fires of freedom in the minds of men."
The Hoover Dam, the U.S. Reclamation Service's project to control the Colorado River, opened. The dam was part of efforts to share the river's valuable water among states that bordered the river. Arizona opposed the project because of concerns that California would get too much water.

Consider this warning on borrowing from a payday loan business: "It would be better to go see someone in a back alley whose nickname is 'Leg Breaker' or your local loan shark. You might get a better deal. If you can't get Leg Breaker to loan you money, see if you can beg some from your mother, your family, your second cousin twice removed on your father's side – somebody, anybody but the 'Payday Loan' guys."
Since July 2009, the Department of Human Services has transferred 463 patients from state hospitals to residential health care facilities, including 63 to Dover Woods. State Human Services spokeswoman Ellen Lovejoy said this is less than 10 percent of those who have left state hospitals, and stressed that some ask to live in these facilities and have a right to make that choice.
"The Incredible Hulk" (2008): Ang Lee, of all people, whiffed on an earlier Hulk film. Louis Leterrier rights the ship, with Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, the brilliant scientist with anger issues. The Hulk is misunderstood mostly because he destroys everything, would be our guess. Norton didn't hang around for "The Avengers," but Mark Ruffalo fills in ably.

That 14-page indictment, unsealed after Robinson's arrest, says that Robinson, board chairman of the now-defunct Paideia Academy, persuaded other board members to approve a resolution in April 2009 lending up to $150,000 to open Little People's Academy day care. He never told fellow members that he was a partner in Paige C. Investments LLC, the day care's owner. The company was run out of his house, the indictment says, with a friend of Robinson's, who was also a bartender at a lounge favored by Robinson.
Caseworkers do not have the equipment to do the job. For instance, a caseworker who goes out to investigate a report of child abuse cannot do background checks on every person living with the child before that caseworker leaves the scene. Basic portable technology, such as laptops or iPads, could make a big difference in deciding whether a child is safe -- especially if it shows the family has a history of child abuse in another state.
Using it in a shooting death that resulted in an involuntary manslaughter conviction is redundant and illogical, said Stanford University law professor Robert Weisberg.

In real life, too, men all but committed murder in pursuit of her.
Greenstone, who later remarried and was known as Reita Davis, was first elected to the board in 1974. Though not the first female Essex freeholder, she was then the only woman on the all-Democrat board and again when re-elected three years later.
Wait a second, says Quarles. You think I killed the trooper? At that moment, Errol the Disgraced Limehouse Henchman bursts in, gun blazing. Quarles turns his sleeve gun toward Givens and Limehouse, apparently thinking Quarles' arm is a piece of pig fat that must be removed at once, cuts the arm off. Givens holds the severed arm and pulls it back and Quarles collapses into a pool of his own blood, shouting "what a world! What a world!"

What: Everyone must die, but bon vivant Randy Pausch transformed this truism into a phenomenon, both on the Web and at the bookstore. His inspirational volume is a voracious read -- not cliche-free, yet we dare the reader to put it down. The Carnegie Mellon computer scientist turned a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer into a jaunty, moving testimonial to what matters most. For anyone having a bad year.
A state arbitrator ruled on March 30 that the city reinstate Frashour with lost wages. Frashour was fired in November 2010 for fatally shooting Campbell, an unarmed 25-year-old African American man, in the back with an AR-15 rifle on Jan. 29, 2010.
The measure, which handily passed the legislature earlier this month, keeps managers from snooping on password-protected content, a practice advocates of the bill say violates privacy and intimidates job seekers and employees.

“It’s a terrific neighborhood,” he added. “We love The Hooley (the annual Kamm’s neighborhood party to be held May 12). We love to walk the neighborhood all the time. We have easy access to great restaurants, we’re less than a mile from Malley’s, and we can get downtown in 15 minutes by driving or taking the RTA Red Line Rapid.”
But a violent piece of weather comes out of the west, a derecho, with hurricane-force winds blowing in a straight line.

For the past week, I've been testing a pre-release version of Flipboard for iPhone. I've also revisited Zite, AOL Editions, Yahoo Livestand and Flipboard on the iPad to check out some updated features in these apps. You may like one more than another depending on how much tweaking you want to do to the app's settings.

The trial had spanned more than five months.
"The important thing for us was having a totally unique look," Pernetti said. "The most important thing is we've built a heck of a lot of equity in this thing (the block R). The most important thing was to incoroprate this in a way that also matches to a complete unique design, which it is, whether it was the numbers that were Knight-inspired, the sword on the pants, the leg with the bloodlines."

These are fine words from a fine mind. Julian Diamond is 15 years old. With more voices like his, what looks to me like an atrophying nest of anger and resentment could morph into a truly transformative experience.
Over time, the Chinese approach facilitated growth, but that growth is not sustainable. Although some Chinese became very rich and others entered the middle class, many Chinese citizens do not feel richer, safer or more secure. Some citizens cannot protect their livelihoods or obtain jobs because they cannot prove residency or property rights.
"No one knows who will name the next generation," says Neil Howe, who, along with his deceased co-author and business partner, William Strauss, is widely credited with naming the Millennials, a generation he figures spans from about 1982 to 2004. Millennials, he says, lived during a huge cultural change in how to nurture children. It was the era of the Baby on Board stickers. Cocooning. Over-protected kids.

"You get all these pieces, and it's a puzzle," he says. "But it's a puzzle that comes together. It's not just a bunch of broken stuff. There is a way that it's supposed to fit. And when it does, you find you're being given as many gifts as you are problems."

The Rockies' gut-wrenching 6-5, 11-inning loss to the Mets on Sunday is going to leave a mark. How the Rockies rebound from a game that featured late-game heroics only to end in defeat will say a lot about them during the remainder of this nine-game homestand.
"Defensively, we are doing a lot of the same things, but we have all new calls and new communication," McCarney told the paper.

“Man, I just blew them,” Bledsoe said.
The Bales case is likely to be equally complex, involving questions of his mental state and the role that the stresses of war and possible previous head injuries may have played in his alleged actions. Most of the eyewitnesses are the Afghan villagers and survivors who may be brought in for the trial.
In a debate days later, he clarified the remark: "We'll move everything to get him. But I don't want to buy into the Democratic pitch that this is all about one person — Osama bin Laden — because after we get him, there's going to be another and another," Romney said.
The link between the proto-Pollocks seen at Dartmouth and the mature abstract masterpieces is the groundbreaking, ex-Peggy Guggenheim "Mural" of 1943. Designed for her apartment's entrance hall, that dazzling achievement, said to have been largely executed in one day, is not only the first but also the biggest of the mural-size Pollocks.
Nevertheless, King says he is undaunted by the challenges that remain in order to put together the team’s roster ahead of its inaugural season in Brooklyn starting this fall.

Cleveland City Council members viewed the casino Tuesday. The tours may be among the last offered before a pre-opening "lockdown" takes effect. Schuler said the casino has to eventually limit visitors to guard against tampering with the games.
This week, the company is looking to come back by applying its budget-conscious approach to mobile broadband. I tested NetZero's $100 4G HotSpot for use with up to eight devices; a $50 4G Stick that plugs into one machine's USB port is also available. These two gadgets provide Internet access using one of five month-to-month data plans, including a free 200 megabytes a month for the first 12 months. NetZero doesn't require contracts and doesn't charge activation fees.
The conservancy believes the 10- to 15-minute gondola ride would engage visitors who come to Catalina to explore Avalon but go no farther. The ride would also generate revenue to help pay for conservation, educational programs and infrastructure, Muscat said.
William Levy turned up the heat to dance a steamy rumba with pro partner Cheryl Burke to Smokey Robinson singing "Being With You." They wound up horizontal on the floor. Bruno called it "utter filth," adding, "I loved every minute of it." He feared women were going to jump off the balcony to get to William. Carrie Ann was less praiseworthy, saying it wasn't his best dance. Len thought it was "a little bit on the raunchy side" and said he couldn't "go into ecstasy like some people here."

A: All I will say is this: If the Heat lose one of the first two games, there is no denying the potential gloom, with no chance to strike back on the Knicks' home court for nearly a week. Win the first two, and the relief will be tangible from the uneven close to the season. But with a loss Saturday or Monday, the Heat will have to live with handing over homecourt at least until next Thursday. To a degree, these first two playoff games will be as significant as the start of any series this postseason for the Heat.

In October, biochemists Charles Zuker at Columbia and Jayaram Chandrashekar at UC San Diego showed that carbonation triggers an enzyme in taste buds that normally sense sourness.

The researchers then bred genetically engineered mice lacking those taste receptors and repeated the CO2 tests. "We can make a mouse with all its sour cells gone," Dr. Zuker says. "And when we make such a mouse, all CO2 sensing is gone."

Pence had a two-out double and Ty Wigginton followed with a two-run single in the fourth inning to put the Phillies ahead 2-0.

The coordination between Leslie's vocal performance and the movements of Audrey II (operated by the unseen Nick Uthoff) are remarkable.

4. Many Christians take hell seriously because Jesus talked about hell. But His explanations of who would wind up there don't always seem to match the evangelical message that salvation comes by "trusting in Jesus". For instance, what do you make of Matthew 25:31-46 ? This parable seems to describe hell as a place for those who don't do the right things, rather than for those who don't believe the right things. How does that fit with the idea of salvation through accepting Christ as savior?

Both restaurants have the air of cozy British tea rooms with their floral tablecloths and color-coordinated walls in sophisticated hues. But the bowls generously heaped with stew-like meat and vegetable "soups," often seasoned with dried seafood, are straight out of the street-side chop houses of Lagos where the chile heat and funky dried-fish undernotes recall rural Thai cooking. Lagos, Nigeria's largest city in the country's humid southwest, is where Shoyinka was raised, and her food reflects its regional quiddities.
A year ago in Seattle, with a fastball that topped 94 mph, Pineda blew away the American League in the first half of the season and went to the All-Star Game.

Some of these are surprising, such as purple pampas grass and butterfly bush. I admit to planting two of the latter in my yard about 10 years ago (one of them died, hallelujah!). I planted fennel not knowing until two years later that it was invasive, even in my parking-strip plot! (The bulb-forming varieties are not invasive, the booklet says.)

But the first draft was a disaster. The writing was cautious and listy, and the solution I concocted to the problem of all the pretty good artists who'd inevitably be left out of the running text was a list at the end of every chapter, with the artists' names in agate type.

Pat Shurmur, on what they loved about Weeden: "I think number one, he has the attributes you are looking for in a quarterback. He is a winner. He obviously took a non-traditional path to being a college quarterback, but he is a very mature guy. He is an outstanding thrower. He is a good decision maker. He is very accurate. He found a way at Oklahoma State to really compete and win a lot of football games against a lot of the quarterbacks that we've been talking about leading up to the draft. We feel like the kid is a winner. I wasn't concerned about his age. I was impressed with his maturity and the way he handled himself, and obviously as a coach watching his productivity on tape and he is a quarterback who helped to lead his team to a lot of victories."

Several days later, President Barack Obama, the most powerful man on the planet, singles you out by name. His campaign brands you a Romney donor, shames you for "betting against America," and accuses you of having a "less-than-reputable" record. The message from the man who controls the Justice Department (which can indict you), the SEC (which can fine you), and the IRS (which can audit you), is clear: You made a mistake donating that money.

Robert and Carl Deiz, who grew up in a racially mixed neighborhood in Southeast Portland, were among 12 Oregonians in the Tuskegee Airmen. The unit of pilots, mechanics, instructors, administrators and support staff was an experiment in the segregated South. The white army brass didn't think that "coloreds" could be trained to fly or would risk their lives to protect their country. But they proved Jim Crow America wrong. Nearly 1,000 African American servicemen earned their wings at Tuskegee.
