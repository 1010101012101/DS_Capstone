So here is a look back at the game stories from his previous two games:
• Shaq Thompson update: visits Washington over the weekend; might he also join Armstead at Oregon? -- Joe Davidson, Sacramento Bee: Thompson has twice given Cal a verbal commitment, so is the third time - the officially binding version this time - the the charm? Thompson first gave a Cal verbal on Bears Junior Day last spring, then de-committed so he could accept recruiting trips across the country to Notre Dame, Arizona State, Oregon, Washington and to Cal. De-committing is very common, and no different from a college offering a scholarship and then pulling it, or offering more scholarships than it has, understanding well that teenagers change their minds, too.

Team doctors suspected a nerve issue and Carpenter returned to St. Louis for what initially was believed to be two days of tests. When the source of Carpenter's problem proved elusive, he remained in town an additional two days, receiving a spinal tap last Friday, which necessitated that he remain home for two additional days.

At the same time, it is in a car rental company's interests to keep the rental process as confusing as possible. Why? Optional insurance is highly profitable to car rental companies, so the more drivers sign up for it - even accidentally - the more money a location makes. I think there's no question that Dollar could have been clearer about its insurance. I've used the digital screens myself and there's a lot of small print; if you're in a hurry, it's asking a lot to read the whole document.
Portland got more assertive in the second period when they had a 13-7 edge in shots and went to the third with a 3-2 lead, but the Americans were the aggressors after that, outshooting the Hawks 17-7 in the third period and 7-1 in overtime.
Deaths and lawsuits have also led to more stringent warnings and barriers at Maui's 'Ohe'o Gulch, formerly touted as the "Seven Sacred Pools," near Hana in Haleakala National Park. It is still permissible to swim in the seven-plus mini-waterfall pools, but gauges and weather forecasts help rangers determine when the risk of flash flooding — which can sweep bathers out of the pools and into the rough ocean below — is too great to keep the pools open. Sadly, an 8-year-old Maui girl was killed May 31 by a rockfall at the base of nearby Waimoku Falls, along the Pipiwai Trail.
I recently moved to Hillsboro, and am looking to open a small business here. I've been coming to Oregon for years, and when I finally could move, I chose Hillsboro because it is a very nice community. The downtown is quaint and inviting. It isn't rushed or glitzy or full of slick advertising like one of the many local malls I can get to quickly. It is calm and relaxing.

Once someone who prided herself on helping others, Scheibner now relies on charities such as the Salvation Army and the kindness of friends and family, co-workers and Elizabeth’s school, Morristown Memorial Hospital pays her every other week, and most of the money goes straight to expenses: the $1,500 rent, her car insurance, cell phone and copays, plus the cable TV.
On average, a difference of about 2.9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day was enough for the students to discriminate on the basis of healthy appearance, with more servings associated with looking healthier. Similarly, about 3.3 servings a day was enough for them to discriminate on the basis of attractiveness — with more servings associated with better looks. (A caveat: One weakness of the study is that most of the participants, and all the artificial faces, were Caucasian.)

As a general matter, federal laws trump conflicting state laws under the Constitution's supremacy clause. But no federal law bars the challenged provisions of SB 1070 in so many words, and the question for the justices is whether federal and state laws are in such conflict that the state law must yield.
Let's note that neither Romney or Santorum won high marks from the Tax Foundation for their economic plans. Romney was given a C-. He offered no step toward fundamental reform, nor would his plan reduce the tax code's complexity, the analysts concluded.
Both Thomas and James were dressed. Thomas spent some time with the first offense during team drills before the game.
The restaurant has proved remarkably willing to alter or remove dishes that don't work, including one of hazelnuts cooked soft and served as baked beans that quickly vanished. The Cheetos-dusted fried cheese curds, once little gnarled balls of crunchy dough, now have a good amount of melted cheese inside. The accompanying balls of fried applesauce no longer gush out scalding hot onto the tongue. The pork with carrot six ways was replaced with a dynamite dish of fried rice with crispy pork shoulder, tender miso-braised pork loin, bacon, egg, turnips and persimmon two ways: pickled and transformed into a sweet daubs of orange-colored jam.

A more well-rounded offensive player. The Yankees can blame bad luck for their early postseason exit. And luck always plays a part in baseball. The postseason is, as we've heard so often, a crapshoot. However, I think the Yankees can try one simple thing to improve themselves. The team could use a hitter who is more well-rounded. By this I mean a hitter who strikes out less, walks less, and doesn't live and die with home runs. It's just a philosophical thing, from my perspective. But I think home run hitters are usually mistake hitters. And it seems pitchers make fewer mistakes in the postseason. I believe this has contributed to some of the Yankees postseason failures. Again, just my view, but I'd like to see the Yankees make a push to replace switch-hitting rightfielder Nick Swisher with switch-hitting rightfielder Carlos Beltran. In Beltran, you've got a different type of hitter, a doubles machine who averages 105 RBI and 111 strike outs per 162 games, compared to the 89 RBI and 142 punchouts Swisher averages per 162.

Meanwhile, the Rangers skated, blocked shots and back-checked for nearly 115 minutes on Wednesday, then returned in full complement Friday in preparation for Game 4 against Washington at the Verizon Center. Aside from Marc Staal's concussion problem early in the season, they have been relatively hale and hearty. Now, after 10 playoff games and one very long night of hockey, they appear remarkably ready to go again. The mere suggestion of cumulative fatigue thoroughly annoys their easily annoyed coach.

In San Diego, some farmers are stumping their avocado trees, cutting them in half to save water; they lose a few years of crop but try to keep their investment alive. Other farmers are switching from lower value row crops, like vegetables and other annuals, to higher value tree crops, hoping to earn more from their limited supply of water. These farmers will quickly learn a new reality: perennial crops mean they can't be uprooted and transplanted; you plant with a future expectation.

COSTA MESA, Laurie Lairson-Lacourciere: What will be the next step if a terrorist decides to blow himself up while waiting in line at a crowded security checkpoint and kills several hundred people in the process? This happens all too frequently at checkpoints in the Middle East. Will Janet Napolitano then initiate checkpoints for the checkpoints? How about a checkpoint outside the airport, in order to get to the checkpoint inside the airport? The number of checkpoints could expand exponentially without solving the problem. All it takes is one explosion to terrify and disrupt our entire traveling population and it does not have to be inside an airplane.

Like a few million other women, I'm besotted with a vampire. What do we want from "Breaking Dawn," the fourth movie in the "Twilight" series? A honeymoon with Rob, of course. The book series was a sensation among teen girls and some of their mothers. But when Robert Pattinson appeared on screen with his strong jaw, yearning eyes and thick, tousled hair, even those of us who didn't care to read every volume were entranced. Despite some cheesy special effects and a ridiculous love triangle between a sulky girl; a chaste, mumbling vampire; and a lusty, buffed werewolf, the "Twilight" movies are one of my ongoing guilty pleasures.

The good news, however, is that Oregon business leader John Gray recently pledged $5 million to the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University.

Worst hit were the 352,100 shares he bought in June 2010 for about $2.5 million, which he later placed into a trust account for his children, according to another SEC filing.

At William B. Pond Recreation Area, the river runs around and over tiny islands, spinning in and out of channels with water sparkling in the late afternoon sun. Hard, carved clay bottom and banks lay exposed. Just inches under the canoe, rocks are packed as tightly as paving. Near Howe Avenue, the paddler feels the resistance of the rising tide. The influence of the sea can often be felt upstream in its ebbs and flows. From the bow, I sense the power and promise of the river. The undertoad lurks beneath.

It will remain a matter of speculation if Danon's early-bird campaign against Supervisor Pam Slater-Price persuaded her to retire or if, after 20 years, she was ready to call it quits anyway, as she has said.

IPS desperately needs a leader who understands that the district is in need of a major shake-up. It needs an infusion of talent in leadership roles, but, unlike The Mind Trust's plan, White's pays only lip service to human capital. It needs students who arrive at kindergarten prepared to learn. But while The Mind Trust plan would shift spending from the bloated IPS headquarters to early learning, White offers no serious plan to expand such programs. IPS needs to be a place where the brightest education minds want to work, but under White it remains a district that can crush the spirit of any innovator.
“Our recent history tears us apart,” Wardak said, according to a published report. “We have created a curriculum based on older history that brings us together, with figures universally recognized as great.

Hey, Scott: In the 12 years of the BCS, nine times a Big Ten team has received an at-large BCS bid. Since the BCS expanded to five games with the 2006 season, the Big Ten has gone five-for-five in getting a second team. Given that the ACC and Big East are so down, and no conference can place more than two teams in BCS bowls, this isn't hard for the Big Ten to do. There will be four at-large spots to be filled by second teams from the Big Ten, Pac-10, Big 12 and SEC, as well as non-automatic qualifying conferences. The most obvious candidates at the moment are Boise State, TCU and second-place teams from the Big Ten and SEC. So Ohio State really might be in a fight with Michigan State and Wisconsin, where two of the three schools wind up in BCS bowls.

Now Bechdel does herself one better with a tender and wide-ranging examination of her relationship with her living mother, an actress and critic with a crisp surface and an intricate interior. Lacking "Fun Home's" high profile melodrama, "Are You My Mother?" is all the more erudite, subtle and charming. Its cool, elegant drawings are rendered in black, white and many shades of gray. Decades of drawing a syndicated comic strip have distilled Bechdel's skills to depict mood, thought and event in the shifting body language of her figures. But here the images have become more complex and visually interesting. While this book is definitely written, the drawings and the text are inextricable and mutually illuminating.

The bollito misto is a dish that's meant to be savored, but it was difficult to enjoy because the service and the timing were so disjointed.

A related requirement limits premiums charged to older adults.

It hopes to have a 352,000-strong force ready by the end of the year, so it can hand over the lead for security around the country to the Afghans by mid-2013. The U.S. and other allied countries will then move into a support role.

Judi Dench, eyes still sparkling, is the recently widowed Evelyn; Bill Nighy, droll as ever, is the unhappily married Douglas; Tom Wilkinson, eternally decent, is retired judge Graham; and Maggie Smith, acid-tongued as always, is the wheelchair-using Muriel -- it's like "The Avengers" for aging Anglophiles.

The Coyotes couldn't get the puck out of their end, a clinical case of hockey constipation. The Hawks outshot them 16-2 in the first period. Do you know how hard it is to do that? Almost as hard as failing to get a goal out of it. The scoreboard said the teams were tied at 0-0.
Then there was Gordy Kokx. For most guys, attending a dance with your mother — never mind dancing with her to "The Way You Look Tonight" — would be mortifying. Not for the 21-year-old Kokx.

Denver police spokesman Joe J. Ramirez said it's much too early to say, statistically, that marijuana operations attract more crime than other businesses that have cash on hand.
We've all got our biases. Some of us only care about fast guitar; to others, the beat is everything. I'm a word man. That's pretty typical of writers, although you wouldn't necessarily know it from the music that gets critically acclaimed these days. So an experimental-music festival crammed with instrumental and semi-instrumental bands wasn't the easiest assignment for me. To make matters worse, the sound in Convention Hall was so boomy that it was tough to understand what anybody was saying. That was okay for Deerhoof, a band that makes music that sounds like classic rock run over by a car. For a wordy hip-hop act like Company Flow, it presented a crippling problem. If you knew all the words to the Company Flow songs, it was a thrill to hear Jus and El-P rhyme. If you didn't, there was no way to access what was great about the act.

A Trials record crowd of 13,750 in Carver-Hawkeye Arena gave Lester a standing ovation for punching his London ticket, and also perhaps for his four-year rebound from a devastating loss at the 2008 Trials.

The administration has also started calling GOP support for extending the Bush tax cuts for top earners the "Romney rule," reminding voters that the Romneys would be among the beneficiaries.

An ugly stretch of MacDill, at dusk. A neon Datz sign beckons coyly, the smell of brisket more of a siren's call. Inside, you don't know where to look. Over to the left where an acoustic guitarist is launching into a set (hey, that guy's pretty good)? Or upward to the huge ceiling and brick walls lined with dark wooden shelves crammed with every imaginable pasta sauce, fancy chocolate, herb and gourmet vinegar? No, it's at the hostess in the natty baseball cap and braids, with a quick glance over to the cheese counter and then back at the beer cooler by the front door (note to self: Delirium Nocturnum big bottle for a very fair $8.99, Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout for $2.99).

Whole oats also contain polyphenols, a class of antioxidant compounds found in all kinds of plant foods (including berries, tea, wine and chocolate) that may play an additional role in keeping the heart healthy. Avenanthramides, polyphenols unique to oats, have been shown -- at least in a cell culture dish -- to interfere with inflammation, a key step in the development of arterial plaque.

Jerel Worthy, defensive tackle, Michigan State: Does he play hard enough to be worthy of inclusion in the regular rotation of Denver defensive linemen? If Worthy fails to give effort, consummate pro Justin Bannan will chew him up and spit him out before lunch. Would Devon Still of Penn State be a safer choice? After Brockers, there are legit questions about the defensive tackles on the board, which might be sufficient reason for Elway to pass on an obvious area of team need.

If SLU basketball were the Westminster Dog Show, the Billikens wouldn't be the Pekingese that won best in show. They might not even be a specific breed. They'd probably be a mix that would be trained to do tough work, part St. Bernard, part rottwelier. They'd be good with kids and protect you in a dark alley. (Have I overworked this metaphor yet?)
Burke says his medical practice on wheels brings relief to tourists with stomach-churning wooziness and headaches that could otherwise ruin their Sin City vacation. He insists he's not promoting drinking -- just decreasing the length of time people are hung over.
"Going to jail is not a boost for your career,'' he explains. "That's a common misconception." Still, it doesn't look like it hurt his. Shyne sold a million records while incarcerated and was fortunate to walk out of jail into a mega-recording deal with Defjam. The twin albums are due for release this year. Their titles — "Gangland" and "Messiah" — raise questions about where the rapper resides between these poles and whether his work can accommodate both.

One of the better scotches I've come across lately is the Singleton of Glendullan 12-year-old single malt (malts.com). This is one scotch that isn't an acquired taste, as most who try it like it immediately. The nose is toffee and roasted nuts, and its color is as golden as an autumn afternoon. It's aged in sherry oak and American bourbon oak casks, so it tastes creamy and sweet with toffee, almonds, and a hint of apple. Don't let its dark gold color fool you, as this is a light and buttery spirit that both scotch and bourbon drinkers will appreciate.
The Rams, who already have quarterback and 2010 top pick Sam Bradford, also have discussed a potential trade with teams outside the top 10, according to a source, but it will be challenging for one to surrender enough compensation to vault to the second overall pick.
"If I had to die and go to heaven with a hot dog, this would be the one,'' Niro said.
As for his outside ability, he displays "good acceleration and straight-line speed to break off long runs. Cuts hard to his left and right equally well to avoid hard-charging safeties. Flashes setting up straight-on defender with inside-out cut which freezes them. Strong stiff-arm denies oncoming tacklers."
"There's a style of play, a tradition that's been set way before these guys, just dominant, changing-line-of-scrimmage defense," Meyer said on Nov. 20 after beating Appalachian State, "and I think we'll get there eventually. We're not there right now."

The day they come out! I go to midnight releases whenever possible. I pay full price for that, unfortunately. For me, it’s GameStop. Always Gamestop. I know all the guys; they know me. I have built that relationship up over the years. If I only have a certain amount of money, and am in need of a game, I can go in there and ask "Hey, what's cool for 60 bucks?" and they have turned me on to several games that I still enjoy today.

Starring Sean Hayes, Will Sasso and Chris Diamantopoulos as Larry, Curly and Moe, this affectionate update is a love letter to the Stooges from the filmmaking Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby. Though they may be best known for the R-rated "There's Something About Mary," there is a Stooge streak a mile long running through their work — the bumbling misfits with a heart of gold in their first film, "Dumb & Dumber," for starters. It ultimately made them a good fit for an idea that has gone through many iterations in the last few years — from a highbrow biopic of the comics to the no-brow roots of its humor.

The warm cheddar biscuits they provide as pre-meal noshes at Searsucker (611 Fifth Ave. Gaslamp. 619-233-7327 or searsucker.com) are always a delight. Addison (5200 Grand Del Mar Way, Carmel Valley. 858-314-1900 or addisondelmar.com) first-course sherry-infused gougères (pastries, aka fromage-filled pâte à choux orbs), set the mood for top-tier eating experiences.
