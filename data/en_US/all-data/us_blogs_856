To make things clear from the get-go, this game and each episode will revolve around a whole new set of characters in the Walking Dead Universe. Although we’ll be seeing characters from the show and comics showing up throughout, we’ll predominantly be experiencing another take on the same timeline through the eyes of other survivors.
And Rick do you know why it’s 20K more, because half those jobs are union. And I hate to tell you this, the goddamn unions are the enemy. They are more corrupt than any business they were formed to oppose and have rigged the system to encourage the most corrupt, most overpaid, most under-working, most useless bunch of steady Democratic voters in history. If you let the free market determine salaries and not unions backed by their corrupt lawmakers (yes, Rick, I mean you) then manufacturing jobs wouldn’t pay that much. That’s why companies leave America, there is no reason to pay someone 20K above the average for a job that requires no education. Like Obama, you’re trying to pick winners and not let the market operate itself. If you knew the first thing about economics you would know that never works.
My grandmother wasn't famous for these. She was famous for Halloween Popcorn Balls (future post, I promise). She also never made these for me, and (rest her soul in peace) if she were here I would be whining about that.

Exhibition preview: July 27 (Friday)
I like to read realistic novels with challenging themes so inevitably my Y.A. novels deal with quite strong issues. Hidden (March 2011) focused on asylum seekers, racist bullying and human rights. Illegal (March 2012) picks up the character of Lindy who first appears in Hidden, the bad girl with a nail sharpened to a spear and tells her story. I had become interested in the rising number of cannabis farms being discovered and raided by the police along the south coast. What if someone set up a cannabis farm on little Hayling Island and asked Lindy to run it?

With a quarter of Spain’s workforce unemployed — approaching 50 percent among younger workers — providing a tough test for the conservative government’s belt-tightening, the rating agencies now call Madrid an increasingly bad risk, raising the cost of refinancing debt. (Much of that debt was created by regional governments to which the former ruling Socialists gave free rein.) With Spain representing almost 5 percent of the EU’s gross domestic product, a bailout is beyond the present capacity of the European Central Bank to finance.

But I think I may have shaken him. Not an easy feat. And for that I am afraid I have scratched at the surface of trust issues I should have left well buried. You see, I did not start to cry because of the pain, I started to cry because I felt victimised. I felt, for the first time, that I was at his mercy, and I felt a slip of my own complete trust in him, that he wouldn’t care when to stop.
Since we shall be celebrating the purification of the temple on the twenty-fifth day of the month Kislev, we thought it right to inform you, that you too may celebrate the feast of Booths and of the fire that appeared when Nehemiah, the rebuilder of the temple and the altar, offered sacrifices.
He is doing so many things in and through my broken life. He is moving in so many ways through the body of Christ all over the earth. His Name is being lifted up...the gospel is being preached...people are living for Him...sacrificially. But what excites me, draws me to my knees is that He chooses to live through ME...sinful, selfish ME! He has given me the boldness to declare His Name, His Truth, His goodness to the lost and the found. He has called and sent me to care for the orphan, the widow, the poor and the oppressed and allowed me to experience His joy as I obey. He has given me the strength to rise above myself and allow wanderer after wanderer to live in our home. Now, I can easily rejoice when I see others doing this...but for me, I know myself...my pride, the wickedness I am constantly fighting against in my own heart.

Look, I want to be a fan of Weeden and do think he possesses some quality traits that could make him a very good quarterback and potential starter down the road. However, being that he is already 28 years old and is still struggling in some very important areas of quarterback play (decision-making, anticipation, progressions) he cannot be considered in the first round in my opinion. I do think Weeden would be a good fit in New York with the Jets, where current starter Mark Sanchez has fallen off the horse some/out of favor and could possibly use some competition to spark his competitive fire and get him motivated to earn and keep his job. This is the type of situation Weeden should go into as the Jets are already a pretty good team and have the pieces in place to compete right now. Brandon Weeden needs to arrive in a spot where he can succeed early in his career and potentially start, but also earn his reps while in a quarterback competition. To me this would be the most ideal situation for a player with limited time before he begins to age and regress from a physical standpoint. Hopefully, if this does happen he has more success in the big city than his first stint as a high draft choice by a New York sports team.

Most aid organizations, which at any rate only pass on only about FIVE percent of all donations received, run huge cash deficits because of their overheads, especially 6-figure wages to their executives, and have to pay off their debts before worrying about mundane things like looking after the injured, starved and homeless victims of disasters.
This is the goal for the day, the Calanque en Vau. The rugged 25 or so miles of coast along the entire Calanques and the countryside immediately inland has been kept a vehicle free zone with only a handful of access points to the trails, and visitors by tour boat to the inlets are not allowed to get off. So walkers have the place to themselves. The area was a natural candidate to become a national park ever since it was first protected, but it took decades to sort out the local rights, restrictions, and politics between the adjacent communities. The last time a national park was established in France was in 1979.
It is their unconditional love, their encouragement, their comfort, their support, their physical presence and embraces in my life, which those things symbolize, that I have lost, and will not recover in this lifetime.

I’m a photographer or maybe an artist… can’t really tell… Sometimes I’m an artist when waking up and feeling the creativity but some days I “just” want to take a camera on my shoulder and photograph whatever that comes in my way. I have always been told that I need to concentrate on one thing and I have always asked WHY? what’s wrong with trying out different things? Ok I can agree that if I would concentrate on one thing, for example portraiture in studio which, I really like doing, I would probably become mush better technical but wouldn’t I miss out to get inspirations from other type of photography that could develop my portraiture???

This conversation has plagued me for several reasons. First, my family is wayyyyyyy too involved in each other’s sex lives. It’s pretty creepy if you think about it. Plus, it’s bizarre that a father would offer to buy his only daughter a vibrator. It’s also strange that he would require said already-creeped-out-daughter to ask him flat-out for this new toy. Finally, the truth of the matter is, I really could use a new vibrator, and I totally don’t have the cash to throw down on one right now. All my current vibes are missing pieces, improperly sized, and/or have a whole lot of miles on them.

The beers appearance is a deep, hazy amber colour that has a very small white lacing head, but it does seem to have plenty of carbonation, with plenty of bubbles racing to the top of the glass. The aroma starts with the sweet smell of honey, but it also has traces of apple, mandarin and a faint herbal nose. Its mouth feel is crisp and refreshing but its body is lacking something and it is pretty thin. Wow. The flavour is very surprising. Its starts of with a pretty tart, almost citric flavour that gives me the feeling that its infected with some wild strain of yeast (which can be a good thing...and also now means I wont have to bother brewing it again!), but after the initial sourness, the honeys sweetness come into play and coats the tongue and slowly balances out the flavour. I'm also getting a faint juniper taste lurking in the background, but no sign of grassy/herbal notes from the nettles or dandelion. Totally unexpected and not bad. Maybe a bad thing to get a wild yeast in the brew, but I think I should give it some proper ageing before trying again so that the flavours develop and hopefully improves the beer as a whole.

My ending is an echo of the first movement of Burnt Norton. Eliot wrote,
So what does monogenes mean? According to the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (BAGD, 3rd Edition), monogenes has two primary definitions. The first definition is “pertaining to being the only one of its kind within a specific relationship.” This is the meaning attached to its use in Hebrews 11:17when the writer refers to Isaac as Abraham’s “only begotten son.” Abraham had more than one son, but Isaac was the only son he had by Sarah and the only son of the covenant.

At this point start applying heavy pressure & when the fight is on, you will know it.

menacing and distinctly no-nonsense. Scenes depicting Thor’s rampaging through SHIELD operatives whilst being sized up by Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) take on, rather than the air of overloaded franchise service, aspects of a broadening world that the characters barely yet understand, even if it all still only serves essentially to soak up screen time that could be better spent deepening the angst of its suddenly mortal and bereft hero, and giving the villain’s aims and motives clearer attention. Nonetheless, whilst Branagh doesn’t make much of the mostly by-rote action set-pieces, surprisingly for the guy who did the still startling Agincourt battle of Henry V (1989), having a director with a genuinely developed sense of dramatic nuance permeates the film in finite ways to make it look, feel, sound more solid and, consequentially and contradictorily, thus more fantastic.

You're right, identity is a recurring theme in my books! I don't know why I'm so often drawn to this issue, but trying to work out who we are and why we're here seem to be big questions that affect us all one way or another! I don't consciously write about children from broken homes but my parents separated when I was ten so, to me, that's a normal background. I think a lot of children fantasise that they belong to a different family - it's part of growing up... part of the gradual process of moving away from your childhood to establish yourself as an adult individual.

I’ve seen wreathes of it for sale in big city markets and fancy garden catalogues around holiday time. Henry Fields has starts for sale at $9.99. Good Lord, we could be millionaires!

It started with Angus coming on to introduce himself as the director and lead actor, explaining that he found Dicken's original 'Hard Times' in a library. After being turned down by larger theatres he has decided to tour the show himself with minimal set, rehearsal time and casting. Angus then asked the audience to bear with them as they were still ironing out some creases... Then, with more current government issue references than an episode of 'Have I Got News For You', the three try to tell the original story of a down and out couple struggling to survive.
Unlike Hae Ra, I think Mi Roo has finally gotten to the point where she might be ready to move on. I say might because she hasn’t really figured it all out yet but I like that Joon is forcing Mi Roo take a long, hard look at herself and her motives for writing the 12 men column. For the last couple of episodes, Mi Roo has been trying to remove herself from the drama that makes up Mi Roo-Jin Oh-Hae Ra love triangle. However, that doesn’t mean she’s examined why she’s doing it. She just thinks it’s the right thing to do to not get in the middle of Hae Ra and Jin Oh’s relationship but this is also a matter of the right people belonging to each other.

Getting there and getting home: It really is a short walk from Hammersmith Tube - IF you know the way. If you don't know the way, it's scary. This is just about the most pedestrian-hostile bit of scenery I've yet encountered in London, even worse than the what-were-they-thinking tunnels around the Waterloo IMAX. So here's what you need to do. When you come up the escalators, you're in a baffling shopping centre. Bear right - how far you have to go depends which escalator you came up. You want the exit from the shopping centre that has a statue of some nudes standing on a box. At this point, turn left. As you go around, you will see a large church on the other side of the road. You want to be going down the road that the church is on, and for now it's easier to stay on the side where the church is, i.e. the left hand side. Use the crossings to get there and keep the church on your left. After a while, you'll see the tall lights of Hammersmith Bridge in front of you, and on the other side of the road you'll see a pub with Oxford in the name. There's a crossing right in front of it. Cross, continue briefly in the same direction you were going, i.e. towards the bridge, turn right and you're on Rutland Grove, you'll see a sign for the tango. From what I gather, it's also pretty difficult for drivers - there are directions on the website.

So, according to my calculations as well as my agency's calculations, our papers should be going to China by the beginning of May. That means by the end of May we should have our LID!!! Oh my goodness, if for some reason there is a miracle and we are actually matched on the first batch of referrals that means we could have her picture in June. Although, I will be happy if we just have a picture before Christmas. Since we are requesting a baby as young as possible with just a very minor heart condition they prepared us that it could be a long wait. They only get referrals once a month, so it could be several, several months before a baby girl with a minor heart defect is available. But, I am prepared to wait because I know God already has her picked for us and I believe she was born for us to be her forever family!

A trip to Europe set the stage for this story. After separating from my husband of many years, I had traveled to the picturesque Loire Valley of France. The nominal reason for my journey was to take a month-long class in anatomical sculpture presented by a master of the art. But, after the breakdown of my marriage, I was also ready for romance. What woman doesn't dream of meeting her prince charming in a romantic setting like that of rural France? I had a premonition that I would meet someone, and I did. He was a sculptor, not from France, but from California. We hit it off and spent 30 days immersed in sculpture, restaurants, wine cellars, medieval castles, and each other. But even as I drank in the wonders of France, I was driven by a second and darker motivation – my son’s mental illness. He had developed paranoid schizophrenia, and I had heard that there was a French clinic that offered a cure for the fractured personalities of this illness. The claims proved to be untrue. But I stumbled across a shaman in the area who was renowned for making his patients whole. And therein the story begins. My search for shamanic healing led me into a surreal world of haunted castles and a village laboring under a curse placed on it by the Mergovinian dynasty. My customers have told me that Woman Within the Web is a must read for all those who are at a crossroads in their lives.
But no one was there for me just this man listening to my call for help and ok of course hes a man and he was waiting for something else but he didnt make me feel like this and i am sure he knew that we would never meet up again.
It's a familiar pattern. I start what seems like a simple task. As I make ever-more-desperate attempts to finish I get constantly interrupted by the latest crisis: by Jackson head-butting into me for the fun of it, Addy climbing on my lap, Jared explaining exactly why Camryn is in the wrong in their latest disagreement, Camryn asking if I will let her make breadsticks, the dog chewing a plastic container lid or Addy deciding to bite my arm just for the fun of it (10 seconds ago). Eventually I give up and flee my laundry folding/desk organizing/dish-doing attempts for the temporary consolation of facebook/blogging/eating a snack that doesn't look like it has too many calories.
I think people generally assume that since we live in an area that has such cold winters, that our growing options are limited. Maybe to some extent it‘s true, but there are plenty of things we can grow that will keep providing for us every year.

Itipini means “at the dump” and Zink went there to work in a clinic through the Episcopal Church’s Young Adult Service Corps (YASC). Zink makes no bones about his struggle with the term “missionary” and his painful awareness of a burgeoning messiah complex. Even as the post- apartheid situation of painful race relations, socio-economic struggle, and rapid social change unfolds in front of him, Zink seems to think each difficult situation is an anomaly.

Happy Monday, everyone! Today, I thought it was time to look at some essential writing tools - or, actually, I should say PUBLICATION tools. Of course, all anyone needs in order to write is a pencil and a scrap of paper. That's how shopping lists are made. But if you want to write something good and get published, you need to make an effort to aquire all of the following items. I really, honestly think that they are essential, and I will now tell you why.

Yesterday was a fairly quiet day. He is getting morphine and adavan regularly to help keep him calm and breathe easier. Mom has also noticed that touching him, hands, face, arm, seems to really stimulate him and bring on more coughing. So we just hold his hand lightly. He had a coughing fit around 8 and again in the middle of the night where fluid backed up into his throat and needed to be suctioned. The fluid comes from the little bit of water they have to give him with some of his meds. Not all of his meds can be given with a shot; two of them have to go into the feeding tube. This morning Mom said they have bumped up his morphine a step, and it seems to help him stay comfortable for a longer period of time.
Just as George Osborne took a hit for reducing the 52p tax to a 47p tax, so Borg’s party paid an political price for helping the rich. ‘If you are going to survive that politically, it is very important to cut taxes on low-income earners.’ He focused the tax credit on the low-paid, giving some the equivalent of a month’s extra salary every year. But there was still resentment. ‘We lost a lot of voters when we cut the property and the wealth tax, I don’t make any excuse for that. It was a severe blow to our support.’

Now I am actually an advocate of URD when done in the right place and at the right time but this is neither in my opinion. While schools are being forced to make absolutely draconian cuts to what is already an embarrassment of a public education system this is the wrong time to start making investments in an areas where the marginal return is probably very low. This is not to say that it should never be done, but when the city and PPS are desperately trying to find $10 million to save 110 teaching positions, the timing just feels wrong. This is also not to say that it should be done, city officials are potentially guilty of overreaching here - using an inappropriate policy tool for goals they are impatient to accomplish. This risk is great that they could spur a backlash and cause the eventual destruction of Urban Renewal as a whole like what happened in California.

On the way there are some peculiar diversions involving Phil interviewing such beer luminaries as a thinner than he looks now Pete Brown & a bang tidy looking Melissa Cole. I say peculiar because these bits appear to have little to do with beer ticking and shoe horned in. Pete informs us of the important role beer has within the history of our sceptred isle on a five minute walk round of Burton on Trent’s brewing museum and Melissa informs us that drinking beer is great and it’s those wine drinkers with their 250ml of 14% grog that are the problem. An argument that falls over later on in the film where we get to see that an important part of beer ticking is indeed getting pissed as that's what happens if you “tick” 13 different beers. Not to mention the 250ml glass of wine being entirely a development from pubs and bars and not a reflection of typical home drinking. It’s as if Phil Parking decided upon a documentary on beer, asked a few well known faces to take part, got a response of “yes”, filmed a short interview entirely unrelated to the topic and slotted it in regardless because like heh, these people are beer celebs.

Why is it that Indigenous Peoples are always accused of creating an us vs. them dynamic in Crown-First Nation relations, when in fact it is the opposite that is true. Our treaties were negotiated so that we could move forward cooperatively, yet Canada (which includes Canada includes ALL federal departments, agencies and commissions as well as the provinces and territories) has broken every promise it has made. Given that our treaties were to maintain peace and friendship, Canada has breached the treaties at every step.

This double-page spread includes a panel from Jack Cole's classic story, "Murder, Morphine, and Me" (True Crime Comics Vol. 1 #2, May, 1947 ). The image is unforgettable, to be sure... and no editor worth their salt would pass up the chance to include this art in their publication as it would certainly draw interest. In the article, it is never mentioned that the scene the panel is taken from is actually a dream sequence, and the entire story is a cautionary tale. (The entire classic story is posted on my blog here). This iconic image simply sits, out of context, as one of the key images in the war against comic books that happened in the United States from 1948-55.

WU flicker, third white strategy today. Man white is strong! And this build is particularly strong too if you get some Nephalia smuggler(U), Cloudshift(W) and Ghostly flicker(U). White and blue have a whole bunch of great come-into-play creatures and can really gain a huge advantage by flickering them repeatedly. You can draw tons of cards, bounce your opponent’s creature forever, gain tons of life, give protection or hexproof at instant speed and much, much more. You can counter spells without any counterspell! This one will be a force to be reckoned whit the right card pool. I know that if I open a total of 5 flicker cards, I will go this route!

I was amazed at the fantastic sound we produced together, and although I had felt tired before the session, noticed that I practically flew out of the practice room afterwards, so energising was the experience.

As an important piece of Yukon history, Parks Canada is not doing anything to “beautify” or correct the destruction the dredge left in her wake – they’re not replanting vegetation, filling in ponds and they’re even leaving her bucket chain laying on the ground, right where it was left.

It is achieved mostly with a little help from international, rather than national, friends. The bar tenders may be all Swedish (like in the rest of Oslo), but ultimately it is the Danish craft brewer Svaneke and its Anglo-Saxon equivalents that represent the craft in the beer festival.

Is it not infuriating that we look for culprits only on the extreme right - which effectively pulls the chestnuts from the fire - without ever exposing the overwhelming responsibility of those, very often calling themselves "of the left", and more often "philosophy" professors than supermarket cashiers, who passionately argued that the Arabs and blacks, especially their youth, corrupted our educational system, perverted our suburbs, offended against our freedoms and outraged our women? Or they were "too many of them" in our football teams? Exactly as it was formerly said of Jews and "wogs" that eternal France was mortally threatened through them.

While the ability to customize a server may be worth its weight in gold, it to has its shortcomings. My two buds, CHAD and erock, and myself hopped onto a server for some squad rush action. After about ten minutes, erock ended up on the other team. At first we thought he had done it by mistake and so he switched back over and we continued to play. The same thing happened again a short while later. Long story short, it turned out the server’s owner (who was on the other team) was switching erock over to his team. When CHAD asked him why he was doing this he replied ‘to balance the teams.’ CHAD went on to explain to him that the three of us were good friends and only play together and he could take anyone else but please do not separate us. He replied with something along the lines of ‘how about you let me administrate my server my way.’ We replied by quitting the server.

Taking any “adult education” class is something of a leap of faith. It’s rare that there are meaningful reviews that one can consult in deciding what is or is not a good value. But let’s agree to stick to these rules of thumb:
The presentation is made to a hostile target because they have created issues of injustice for that person. They, the evil people want the hostile targeted person to struggle against them as an unseen enemy; however to do that they have to “enliven” the area or what is really a theatre of war in the body and this is pure treachery. They make certain that there is activity in a specific organ or tissue in the body, to which the harmful ideas appear to be related. The most effective means is emotion. As I described at the start emotion is the changes in body function in order for some job to be done in or by the body. Emotion then fit the bill nicely so activity can be created by further issues that can be created.

When I was younger I wrote a few stories. For various reasons, over the years this stopped. I still got and still get, ideas for stories, characters and so on, so I have continued to put down some notes over the years, with a view to returning to them, and using them on something. In paid employment I have written technical stuff. I’ve written technical documents that detail entire custom software programmes which are easily over 100 pages each. So quantity, logical thinking, specific details and the skills necessary for technical writing come easily enough. I seem to be able to edit others work quite easily as well, correcting things or giving pointers for changes. But I’ve no wish to be doing only that for the rest of my life, especially the former, and herein lies the underlying issue. The stories and such which exist in my head, well they’re starting to fight their way out, they don’t want to be just stuck in there anymore, and they’re asking me to help them get there. Or, that is what it feels like. Having not written fiction for a long time, I wonder, or perhaps doubt, if I can do it. But there is a niggling urge to see if that is true.
I read. A lot. Or, I did read a lot but then school actually started to get stressful and my bookshelf started to seem unappealing. YA lit…YA lit everywhere. Except for a couple of novels, like Harvest and Animal Farm. But I’m pretty particular about the books I read. I won’t read books about spoiled children who constantly complain about being too skinny, I won’t read teen romance novels (what is even the point of those anyway; everything’s been done already), and I won’t read thousand-page epics about crazy old men who run at windmills.

4) Post Views per Contributor - Nothing like stirring up a little competition among your employees, right? If there is a certain author who receives more views on average than other authors, dig in to learn why. Is it because he has a larger social media following to promote his blog post to? Is it because she wrote about a topic that garners more attention? Use this metric to generate some friendly rivalry that helps increase content quality.

It may not actually be a badger costume, I admit. It could be a zebra. Or a humbug. With eyes. But let's just say it's a badger, okay? He's the spawn of badgers, and is thus a badger. And doesn't he look pleased about it.
No matter the wobbles, the power of fairytale, especially when bedecked in the perfect tulle skirt, has a sustaining power. And the dancing is as strong as ever. Besides, the killer dramatic and physical challenges will come soon enough, when Pacific Northwest Ballet debuts a historical reconstruction of “Giselle,” from Peter Boal and Doug Fullington, at the opera house in June.
Cheater, Cheater, Pumpkin Eater (CCPE) – CCPE was the first guy to really break my heart. He cheated on me, how’d you guess? Interestingly enough (and I never said this story was going to be flattering), CCPE was College Guy’s brother. I know: I suck. You’ll think I suck even more when I tell you that they have another brother that one drunken night kissed me as well. That story isn’t so fun, because shortly after he kissed me, he puked on the floor. I’m THAT good of a kisser. There is a fourth brother that I have never kissed, thank God. I already feel pretty gross about kissing three out of four brothers.

The second eye was just the same. I was a little more anxious during the flap lifting process of the second eye. I think because I was unaware of what was actually taking place and really worried about focusing on the light. Once the doctor lifted the flap, he said that he needed me to settle before proceeding. I immediately was able to do just that and everything proceeded smoothly from there.
Have a great day, and be sure to come back for tomorrow’s collaboration post.
Honestly, I don't feel that relieved to have graduated. Mostly because I thought I'd be smooth sailing at this point with a good job and a pretty good life lined up for myself. Sometimes life throws you curve balls.
Two things struck me, firstly how lucky we are to have such a resource so close to our site, in addition to the items listed it stocks everything you might possibly need in the pursuit of gardening as well as plentiful help and advice. Secondly having lived in Eastcote for nearly fifteen years why did I only became aware of it when I took over the plot.
As we went back to the same elevator we ascended to catering in, we descended to the 1st level. The only indication as to where we were going was a piece of gaffer's tape that said, Stage, next to the 1 button.
And that is also why what is here called "neoliberalism' has at times also been called "neoconservatism". These days, however, "neoconservatism" is usually applied to a much different set of ideas -- of which a little more shortly.
Cathie leaned over. "No more bitching about deadlines for you," she informed me cheerfully. I had to agree; Poe's writing deadline seemed pretty stressful. Mine tend to lack that whole iminent death vibe.
Anyway I haven't got anything particular to say about it except that it was fun and quite interesting and some senior managers heard things they needed to hear, which was the point of the exercise as far as the company was concerned. What I got out of it was taking a little time to think about some things. Not so much about my own relationship with my employer, which is a very satisfactory one, although it's possible that the company and I could both get more out of each other if some things were different. But about the sort of big ideas this celebration brings to mind.
When those affected visit their physicians, they’re told it’s “all in their heads.” Authorities also turn a deaf ear—as does the government when it’s presented with scientific evidence of the dangerous effects of Monsanto’s products for their people and environment. Fortunately, increasing numbers of scientists are now starting to speak out. For example, the engineers’ school in Santiago del Estero announced that chemicals are causing 100 babies to be born with deformities every year. One of the most influential studies was conducted by one of Argentina’s leading scientists, Andres Carrasco, who works in Argentina’s Ministry of Science.
My mother-in-law saw me thrilled by these flowers and added to my knowledge about them. She told me that the Malayalis call these flowers ‘Kani Konna’, and that they are an important part of the celebration of the Malayali New Year, Vishu. Before the sun is up on the day of Vishu, these flowers are beautifully arranged in a plate by the ladies of houses all over Kerala, along with money, new clothes, sweets and seasonal fruits, and placed before the idols of God.

1. Because Romance is not dead – de Palma is often pilloried as a crass imitator of other, better, filmmakers, especially Hitchcock, and there are certainly nods to Rear Window, Vertigo and Psycho here. But this is also a distinctive, personal and deeply romantic conception, in love with the syntax of film and its malleable properties, one that repays several viewings as we realise just how carefully layers of meaning have been crafted into the whole (just keep an eye on the clocks and on some strange activity involving the supporting cast members). On top is a valentine to Film Noir; beneath comes a critique of its conventions; and beneath that a celebration and a summation of cinema’s ability to synthesise so many art forms to create nuance and meaning in a new work. A stunning achievement, especially if you have a sense of humour.

Lancôme also gifted its guests with free Vernis in Love manicures at this party. Angie gravitated towards Vernis in Love in Rose Thé (350M) a muted, brownish pink, while Jessica fell for Rose Plumetis (300M, pictured), a cool-toned rosebud pink with a creme finish. Angie also admired Madame Tulipe (179M), a deep reddish wine, and many women at the event adored Rose Pitimini (343B), a vibrant cotton candy pink. The polishes apply smoothly and easily, thanks to a specially grooved and tapered brush, and two coats give full coverage that lasts for days.

Jermaine Paul, Living on a Prayer – I wasn’t overly impressed with this performance. I didn’t love it, but I didn’t hate it…it was just “meh” for me. I did like how he came up from under the stairs in the audience, and he seemed to enjoy interacting with the crowd. But beyond that, this wasn’t very memorable for me.

Wierdly he hit his cool-down just a few seconds after mine. Again I had to keep my cool and do the full warm down, and record my stats (10km, 57:52 for an average speed of just under 10.5km/h), and finally I was able to nonchalantly wander past the back of his machine and I had a wave of relief when I surreptitiously read his stats: 5km in 35:00 minutes. Less than 10km/h. And only 5k. Thank God! He wasn't Better Than Me, he was just a common or garden Wanker.

During World War II Mr. Weedon worked as a part of rescue services. Following the war he joined jazz violinists Stephane Grapelli’s group. He played with various popular dance bands until in the early Fifties he joined the BBC Show Band, then led by Cyril Stapleton. He played for both BBC Radio and the BBC Television Service (now BBC One). Over the years he would be part of the music department of such shows as The Square and BBC Sunday Night Theatre. It was in the mid-Fifties that he was signed to Parlophone. His first single, "Stranger Than Fiction," was released in 1956. He would have hits with the instrumentals "Guitar Boogie Shuffle (which went to #10 on the UK singles chart in 1959)," "Nashville Boogie (which went to #29 on the UK singles chart in the same year)," "Apache (which went to #24 on the UK singles chart in 1960)," "Sorry Robbie (which went to #28 on the UK singles chart in the same year)," and "Ginchy (which went to ##35 on the UK singles chart in 1961)." He also played as a session musician for artists ranging from Adam Faith and Tommy Steele to Frank Sinatra and Nat King Cole.

According to the indictment, the two brought the women to the Rosen Music Studio, a karaoke bar in Chalan Laulau, and forced them to provide sexual services to customers for a fee. Most, if not all, of the commercial sexual acts were performed, however, outside the karaoke bar, the indictment states. Lin allegedly provided Rosen Music Studio with women in exchange for a portion of the proceeds.
When we get to the concert hall several hours later, no one is wearing academic regalia -- at least, not yet. The graduates will not arrive for a little while from morning exercises. But there are families milling about, some members clutching black robes striped in kelly green, the colors for those who already hold degrees in medicine. These are for the hooders, most of them parents of the graduates but some of them spouses or siblings.

The Easter Fire is lit on the top of mountains (Easter mountain, Osterberg) and must be kindled from new fire, drawn from wood by friction (nodfyr); this is a custom of pagan origin in vogue all over Europe, signifying the victory of spring over winter. The bishops issued severe edicts against the sacrilegious Easter fires (Conc. Germanicum, a. 742, c.v.; Council of Lestines, a. 743, n. 15), but did not succeed in abolishing them everywhere. The Church adopted the observance into the Easter ceremonies, referring it to the fiery column in the desert and to the Resurrection of Christ; the new fire on Holy Saturday is drawn from flint, symbolizing the Resurrection of the Light of the World from the tomb closed by a stone (Missale Rom.). In some places a figure was thrown into the Easter fire, symbolizing winter, but to the Christians on the Rhine, in Tyrol and Bohemia, Judas the traitor (Reinsberg-Düringfeld, Das festliche Jahr, 112 sq.).

The price of not talking about these processes or encouraging children to become independent is very costly. Youth who are continually forced to comply with social stereotypes may develop behavioral problems or depression. Like adult transgender persons, they may also become estranged from family relationships. Youth who become disillusioned with their families may end up homeless and at risk of victimization and disease. Some may commit suicide, leaving others with no explanation or insight into the pain they were suffering. As adults, those youth who were not permitted to give voice to gender identity issues may find themselves in tremendous anguish later in life. Tragically, these children frequently become the very stereotype the parent had hoped to prevent…a gender conflicted adult who self destructs careers and relationships as well as their own children.

Another popular YouTube user became famous by unintentionally being hilarious. Chuck Testa, a taxidermist at Ojai Valley Taxidermy, posted his television commercial on YouTube and has received almost 12 million views and 88.5 thousand “likes”. The Ojai Valley Taxidermy channel “Testas Tuesday Tips” on how to correctly skin and “stuff” various animals. “The most lifelike dead animals anywhere… Period!” may be Ojai’s slogan, but the repeated line “Nope! Chuck Testa” in the television commercial is what Chuck Testa is known for. In his commercial, Chuck Testa “fools” people with his “lifelike dead animals” only to reveal that “Nope. They’re not. They’re dead.” Testa goes on to display his animals in ridiculous scenarios but still fooling onlookers because the animals are so lifelike! “Look at that antelope driving a car!” But then Chuck Testa pops out and informs the idiot that “Nope! Just Chuck Testa!” Another scenario features a girl lying in bed next to a bear, “Oh no! There’s a bear in my bed!” But luckily Testa comes out from under the covers and comforts her with “Nope! Chuck Testa.”

I have never submitted even one photo that I haven't tweaked with some kind of photo editing program. I don't mean add funky hazes or vignettes, you just want them sharpened, saturation played with and brightened up. Just remember, you can't fix a bad photo. Work on lighting and steadying the camera first.
In short, I want to truly LIVE every minute of every day with a real sense of purpose. I want to start with little and end with much – and not just in money. I want to cultivate relationships. Love. Grow. Explore. Learn. Channel myself towards causes I believe in – causes that will really go towards making the world a better place to be… for me, this comes in the way of helping people live their truth with freedom and purpose. If a career happens along the way, fine, but it’s no longer my primary goal in the area of work.

She was purposefully babbling while following an invisible line from one side of the room to the other leading to the ceiling. What have you been up to, Drew? Have you been exploring the world far from home? I like to imagine you experiencing the world and coming home to share. We will always be waiting with open hearts. We love you, Drew.

Like many authors I like to visit schools and talk to the children about my work. I also run workshops to encourage the children how to come up with ideas for stories and to get them writing. They’re always good fun and I love meeting the children, it’s one of the best parts of my job. One of the things I like to do is to build up a story around the class and see what ideas the children come up with.

But this is an image I am willing to be stuck with. In fact, I’d much rather you think of me as the mean mama than for you to think that my child is crazy or insane! Which is why I’m OK with you thinking I am mean for not giving him a piece of cake the size of a baseball, or as many candies as he can manage to eat throughout the time at the party. I’d rather you think I’m mean now than have you thinking he’s crazy later because he’s literally bouncing off the walls and being one of the rudest, most impertinent little children you’ve ever seen. I’d rather you think I’m a mean mama because I don’t allow my little girl to run around the room full of people “harmlessly” playing tag with another little girl. Better to think me a mean mama than for you to think she’s insane as she literally looks drunk and crazy and then can’t stop herself and could even end up hurting another child later. Better to think me a mean mama…

Day after day I receive emails promoting new novels. They come from established publishing firms and from self-published novelists. They are so frequent I have an automatic email reply message wish them well, but noting that the volume of new novels makes it impossible to accept their request.
Stone's production, co-translated with Tom Wright (not to be confused with Thomas M. Wright, who is playing Baal), is a serious and often brilliant attempt at Brecht's play. Although the script is hugely cut, it sticks closely to the original text, transposing its obscenities and undeniable beauties into contemporary colloquial English. Likewise, Brecht's songs are set to electric guitar by Stefan Gregory, but remain ballads rather than rock'n'roll. Baal is no Thyestes or The Wild Duck, in which a new text is spun out of the bones of the original, so here the estrangements of poetry are added to the alienations produced by its lead character.
I was discussing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software with a fellow student in a grad school class. The discussion revolved around the professors question, “how might an ERP system help Harley-Davidson improve its position in the market?” My first thought was an ERP system could help Harley reduce its perpetual two-year backlog on the delivery of certain models.

5. Enforcing Prohibition was a disaster. For every Eliot Ness, for every Mo Smith and Izzy Einstein (pictured here, sharing a legal drink after Repeal), there were a hundred corrupt enforcement agents who signed up for a chance to make bribe money, get away with shooting rivals, or to get inside information on raids for their gangster bosses. Enforcement was underfunded -- often on purpose -- and at times vicious: there was support among some Drys for not labeling wood alcohol as poison, or for simply poisoning all alcohol. And it never stopped more than a minuscule amount of the huge illegal trade in alcohol.

Snow’s creepy determination to prevent Eve’s death maintained the reality that she was necessary for the vampires to take over the world but it was his scenes with Hal and Annie that impressed the most. I’m kind of disappointed in a way that Snow did perish because I would’ve loved more scenes with him and Hal.

And before I go, here is truly awful piece of 'cod reggae as performed by 60's pop icon Sandie Shaw on a popular British TV show called '2 G's and The Pop People' in 1972. In a word this is 'horrendous'! Sadly the song borders on the worst aspects of minstrel. And while Shaw was no racist, this was the era of television when Black and White artists sadly remained mostly separate. You may want to clean your ears out with soap after listening to this one!

I’m not going to claim that my photos are all that great, I know better than that, but I think I do OK with the way that I go about getting the photos I do. I don’t stake out the nests of birds, don’t bait animals, and try not to disturb any wildlife more than I absolutely have to. OK, so I do check out Mother Goose nearly everyday, but I stick my head up above the berm just enough to see if she’s there or not, then leave. If she hadn’t nested where she had, I would actually walk farther in her direction than what I do, and spend more time there because I have a good view of the pond from that point. In a way, she’s cutting into the photos I could be getting if she hadn’t nested where she did.
Reverend Matthews,
Fritz Maytag created “craft beer" when he rescued and renovated Anchor in 1965, thereby making the SF Bay Area the epicenter of the beer renaissance (and, dare I say, the foodie movement, considering Alice Waters wouldn’t open her groundbreaking Chez Panisse across the bay in Berkeley until 1971.) After 45 years, he sold it in 2010 and the new owners plan on doing something ol' Fritz never would have--creating a "Center of Excellence." Daily tours have always been offered, but soon tours will include the Anchor Distilling corner, too, and welcome all comers. Stay tuned.

I have to do something about it. Of course, not a diet. I don't believe in diets. Their results come as quicky as they gone. I need to recover the healthy habits: eat better and do exercise often. I need to avoid eating chocolate and snacks as much as I can. And, I need to learn to channel the stress in another way (maybe yoga would be a good idea?).
I honestly don't know what Jacob's were thinking. I know it's all meant to be a bit of light-hearted fun, but I find it jarring and unsuitable for what's been a family-favourite style product for as long as I can remember. There's also an excruciating two and a half minute music video that's an extended version of the ad, containing such lyrical dynamite as "I'm hip, I'm hot, I'm everything you're not" and "I'm a naughty girl and it's making me hot". You can watch it here, but you probably shouldn't, unless you're the type of person who gets a kick out of burning themselves with candle wax or poking their bruises. You have been warned.
I hope you are inspired.
A great first step is sitting down with each of the departments in your company (and you can simply do this with individual employees if your company is smaller), to find out who they talk to and how they communicate every day.

If they still ignore you, or give excuses about waiting for re-financing, or their suppliers not paying them, or any similar guff, you can decide whether to wait longer or take further action. Some writers consider a debt recovery agency. An agency will ruthlessly pursue the non-paying publisher, but they will take a portion of the money. A better option (in England and Wales) is the small claims court. Write to the publisher (accounts department, copied to your editor and to someone higher up if you like) saying you will start small claims court proceedings if they have not paid you within seven days.

McKenna would see our present earth-battering by solar flares (M-class flares yesterday, X-class flares today, see NOAA index, sidebar right) as yet another sign of the approaching Eschaton. I think he would again offer his previous advice: to take responsibility for how we think and what we do.
The siding on the weather side of the house is shot, and needs to be replaced. Charles' studio needs to have siding put on since it has tar paper, which is an improvement over the Tyvek that was on it for the last 10 years. The shed is a great storage area, but would be better enclosed. We are thinking that corrugated clear fiberglass would be good. It would block the weather, but still let the light into Charles studio. The porch has been a dream of mine for years. I would love to have a porch in the front for the rare nice days. Ideally, we would take out the big window in front and install French doors. (I can dream, can't I?).
For his information, the term “Total Onslaught” was coined by the French general, General André Beaufre who was for many years the French’s chief strategist and whose ideas and writings are incorporated all over the world, in fact in the US and British militaries as well.

While they're baking, make your cinnamon sugar (1/2 cup granulated sugar mixed with about 1tsp of ground cinnamon), and pour it into a paper bag. When the churros come out of the oven, let them cool just enough so you can handle them. Put a couple at a time into the bag and shake to coat with cinnamon sugar. Enjoy them while they're warm with a glass of milk!!
Awready! kicks off on March 27th with the opening of the “Graffiti, B-Boy and B-Girl Exhibition” (sponsored by the HERE Project, Rice University) at Betz Gallery, 1208 W.

The TRUE test of will. Today was an office birthday. And the office catered lunch. I happily munched on my spinach and egg-less salad while all of my co workers enjoyed macaroni and cheese, chicken pot pie, cookies, brownies, and eventually birthday cake. I was expecting the desserts to be the hardest thing to turn an eye too, but honestly, I didn't even really want any. I was craving the Blueberry Pie Larabar that was waiting in my purse for a mid afternoon snack. This is a MAJOR deal. Usually sweets, and especially chocolate, are impossible for me to resist. Go cleanse!!

If you're reading Europa books, this one is probably required at some point. I'm glad I read it. I'm going to read a bunch of Italian Europas for the next few months since I'm going to Italy in the fall with my family. This was a great book to get me going.
As I get older, I am learning to be more appreciative of all of the many facets of life. No tomorrow is every guaranteed to us so live each day as if it could be your last and make sure that everyone around you knows how much you love them. When my grandmother died on Friday, it was sad, but beyond the sadness was peace, joy and love. Peace that she's in heaven singing in a choir of angels - she even spent her last days singing quietly to herself at times. Joy that she is no longer in pain and her body is no longer broken by age, disease or sickness. She is a radiant version of my spunky grandma from my childhood. And love because she was love. She gave love freely to all of us, telling us how much she loved us often. She never held a grudge and was always in your corner. Her love will live on in so many ways.
It feels like, the moment you put your foot on the floor the morning of the 23rd, you activate fully the field of energy you have brought your DNA to. Like everything in this crazy duality field called life… it truly can be a double-edged sword.

I share the writings I have received from the spark of wisdom within, for any who is inspired by these words to continue to hope and prevail.

Well that is the four and twenty blackbirds as promised by the title of this post. Beautiful birds, with a bit of attitude, they are so much a part of the spring sights and sounds around the pond now and through the summer. When out for a walk in the park I make time to stop and watch their antics and listen to their songs; on a warmish Spring day seated on a comfortable bench it is a simple but distinct pleasure.

Should my stories ever be published, you can count on my hero and heroine trying to surmount evil. Even if it seems impossible, they will survive, become better people, and within their abilities, do good in their world. I try to do the same. And if there is a God, perhaps that will be enough.
There is a wonderful book by Toby Mac and Michael Tait, “Under God”, published in 2004 by Bethany House. If anyone doubts that the Founding Fathers were men of profound faith, they should read this book of the nation’s early history. At one point they tell of Thomas Jefferson returning to the Continental Congress with a draft of the Declaration of Independence.
What am I doing on WordPress? Why does an LLC need to blog? As we skip through the Social Age of post-techno-industrialism a new era of accountability has dawned. Companies should no longer be faceless “theys” and “thems” that are clearly out of touch with capitalism or communism or terrorism as they auto-tweet and auto-facebook post pre-generated content from bored interns. Neither do we need an abrupt departure from the status quo that does nothing but transfer from 1% to dichotomous 1%. I just needed to blog.

I’m sure all you non-fat jealous losers out there are a little confused as to what I’m talking about. That’s probably because you’re all so busy living the ultra-glamorous lives that inherently come with being thin and not jealous and not losery to spend much time on random blog hating.

If I could give Ada Street another name, it might be Hernando’s Hideaway. It’s a very intimate fifty-seat dining room (including bar), a perfect place for pulling each other close with conversation and canoodling in its shadowy holds. Ada Street is wonderful for small gatherings of friends, groups of no larger than four. Do call ahead and make reservations if you want dinner. My favorite of the small plates menu was the ricotta-stuffed, bacon-wrapped rabbit on special. Sharing is caring.
Oh, where to begin, where to begin. I suppose Conor is the first place to start, seeing how he’s the first and perhaps biggest problem. Have you ever seen Saved by the Bell, the early nineties high school sitcom? The protagonist is a one Zack Morris, a scheming wiseacre who spends some time breaking the fourth wall and winking furiously at the audience. Conor is like Zack—except without the charm, wit, or personality. He truly kept reminding me of bad Nickelodeon pilots in the nineties; he spends most of his time cracking unfunny jokes that he knows no one in Tir Na Nog will get, but he still makes them, which just makes him look like an ass to be honest. The other characters in the novel are potentially interesting, such as his parents—his mother is an immortal supernatural being and his father gave up his immortality to raise Conor in the Real World. What must their relationship be like? Of course, Conor doesn’t think about this all, merely cracking that he should probably go to his room when his parents have a tiff for the first time in front of him. Fergal, the banshee, is just the sort of snarky best friend I love in terrible fantasy movies, but it’s all about Conor. I’d go on, but you get the drift. He’s boring and unfunny.
A Practical Guide to Working with TRIPS, by Antony Taubman -- formerly of WIPO, now with the WTO and himself the contributor of a substantial book review for JIPLP. This book is published by Oxford University Press and its details are available here. While experience of having worked with TRIPS would be an ideal qualification for a reviewer, that would exclude most IP experts straight away -- but both within the professions and academe there are many people who have had an opportunity to watch, to advise and to form an opinion of TRIPS in operation.
Woody Guthrie summed up the situation in these two (unfortunately) ageless stanzas:
Now Israel are muttering about taking out Iran's nuclear facilities within the next few weeks. Iran are answering that if they even try Israel will be obliterated and so will their greatest ally, the US. So the US, although I think, for once, they don't actually want war, are upping their nuclear armament, and the UK, with its cut defence budgets, are preparing to stand shoulder to shoulder, again, with the Americans.

Something that I would find incredibly baffling – if I didn’t know exactly what’s going on here – is the amount of women I’ve come across online in my post-prostitution life who claim to be happy in prostitution. I would find it incredibly baffling because I never met a single one of them in all the years I was in prostitution.

For thirteen thousand years, we have been in separation. We see everything as polarized–good or bad, up or down, hot or cold. We judge everything that happens, which keeps us in this mode of perceiving. As an example of this separate way of looking at life, if your body gets cold you think of a fire or a heater; you think of something outside yourself. This has led to our increasing dependence on technology. We become weaker when we keep giving away our power to technology–that is, to external objects. We then become dependent upon these objects, and soon get to the point where we can’t do anything for ourselves.

If you practice the simple things hard, the hard things become simple.

This will be difficult, I'm sure. At this point, I'm willing to make some sacrifices to really get my health in order and to start feeling better! Hopefully, this will even help with my headaches (by getting rid of all of those nasty toxins), at the end of this journey. I'm hoping to loose a little weight during this challenge but that is not my main reason. I truly want to be healthy, to rid my body of toxins, help boost my metabolism and hopefully I will exchange bad habits for good ones!

He got the name which replaced his original one from the tales he told about Bombay. The city was called Bombay because its streets were littered with bombs through which pedestrians must carefully tiptoe, the veteran said, except if one fancied levitating sky high as blown-up mincemeat. Named for a city he's never been to, named for a fantasy, named for the sound of the word and the associations it conjures. Playfulness, whimsy. (The associations it conjures are of death, destruction, danger. Seriousness.)
The Tale of the Body Thief is the fourth book in Anne Rice’s Vampire Chronicles, but by this book, it seems like her heart wasn’t really in to writing it. While the premise of the novel is interesting enough and her descriptions are just as wonderful, it seems to lack the spirit and enthusiasm of the first three books. It seems as if she was pressured into writing a fourth book to capitalize on her series’ fame and that’s the worst reason for any author to write a book.

Fear shuts down our responses. We feel adrift in a hostile world, besieged by violence and evil. It makes us herd together and haul up the drawbridge. It's the other side of the same coin that Clare describes as the 'pack instinct'. As a result, we tend to mix only with people who we feel are 'like us' and think 'like us'. And once we succumb to that, those we perceive as being different - outside our pack - become a kind of braying amorphous mass. We invest them with near-mythical powers. They're out to get us. And they're everywhere.
7. (U) In order to confront the situation, Meles discussed GOE efforts to engage the CIC in negotiations on two occasions to obtain a commitment to end the group’s threats against Ethiopia and change its policies. These attempts had been rebuffed. The PM argued that the GOE had a right to defend itself and had been preparing to do so. The GOE’s first preference was still negotiation — an option for which there was still time — but stated that "we can’t avoid the problem. If peace is not possible, based on international law we will take steps commensurate with the present danger." He asked that the Parliament support this course of action. EPRDF Whip Shiferaw Jarso presented the GOE’s proposed resolution, which declared Ethiopia’s desire for peaceful

Let’s move forward about fifty years. The masses were now beneficiaries of a broadened public education system, which, according to the text, “meant that the reading class grew exponentially” (text 1930). However, in T. S. Eliot’s opinion, they still lacked a sense of refinement that Arnold had written about earlier. This is exemplified in their “complacent taste” for “easily consumable” entertainment (text 1930). This separation in literature was termed high-brow and low-brow to denote the aristocracy from the underclasses. T.S. Eliot and his contemporaries responded by creating “difficult,” high-brow literature that would appeal to the “aristocracy of taste” rather than the masses (text 1930).
If so, say “yes – responsible manifesting” and allow Creator to provide you truth and clarity and wisdom and connection to your co-creative abilities and gifts. To be able to live and experience this life as a co-creator is an amazing, incredible, wonderful gift that defies words. Take that to heart and be consciously responsible for your thoughts, your actions, and your desires/manifestations. You are powerful beyond measure. You are incredible. You are the gift. When you know that and believe that, your heart will open and align with the Divine and your life will be filled with joy and peace.

Unlike probably every other horror fan in the world, I did not see Thing 1 until a few months ago and believe it or not, the first time I watched it, I wasn't completely crazy about it. Granted, I was a little distracted and not in the right frame of mind to really appreciate it, so I knew I had to give it another chance. Holy crap... that movie is a-freaking-mazing. I am now in the club of everybody who thinks Thing 1 is one of the best horror movies ever. So... what about Thing 2?

In her review of the book, A.V. club’s Ellen Wernecke questioned Marcus’ objectivity on the subject of the Riot Grrrl’s dissolution and factionalism. Where Marcus sought to blame “external forces” like tensions over media policy for factional disputes. Wernecke suggested Marcus add two other factors: “insularity and inflexibility.” While Marcus acknowledged these two dynamics, for Wernecke she did so “not often enough.” Wernecke raises a good point, but to be fair, one would be hard pressed to find a youth social movement that didn’t struggle with these issues. The music and vibe that inspired Riot Grrrls, punk, was rooted in insularity and inflexibility. When Joe Strummer formed the Clash, he and the other members admitted to being “Stalinist” in their relations. Old friends found themselves no longer acknowledged. Much like Kathleen Hanna and others, the Clash believed a mission sat before them. When Green Day exploded, punks from the Berkeley scene savaged them. The intellectual influence, academia — think bell hooks, Judith Butler, and Angela Davis – rivals the kind of elitism one finds in indie/punk music scenes. Marcus expresses trepidation over interpretations that might characterize RG factionalism as “catfighting,” women clawing at women for the wrong reasons. In reality, what she captures serves as reminder of how difficult social movements are, notably those in our youth, when figuring out one’s identity remains hard enough. The Riot Grrrls’ disregard for centralization and hierarchies deserves commendation, but as a foundation for a persistent and self-sustaining movement, unlikely. Then again, maybe this kind of thing just can’t be “planned”. Maybe, that wasn’t even the point.
So why is anyone questioning the act of praising?

Example 2 from Palermo crypt: “The bodies exhibited here were fully dressed, some just skulls and others with brown skin stretched around screaming heads like mummified horrors. The bodies were stacked two levels high, hung on hooks to keep them stable in a minstrel’s gallery of mortality. Their clothes were mainly in tatters now, but Morgan could see that they were once fine fabrics with trimmings of lace and fur. She looked more closely at one of the mummies. His teeth were bared in a grimace, lips shrunken back. His eyelashes still lay upon leathery cheeks. He had been posed as if at prayer, in a tribute to the God he expected to meet.”

It was a tight fit, but by golly I got 'em zipped :)) I notice that I had a tendency to buy clothes that I knew didn't fit me at the time, or would be a little snug, but I always told myself, it will fit me soon. Pfffft. Well, now they are fitting me. So many cute summer dresses and my old t-shirts that were too tight. So much stuff I forgot I even had! I found a dress today that I got from Marshalls last summer, I couldn't wear it, but now I can.

And yet, there’s something restful about the grounds despite the hordes of tourists roaming the aisles. It’s part mausoleum, part museum, part history lesson. Soaring ceilings, glorious stained glass windows, a powerful pipe organ, and busts, statutes and memorial slabs to a who’s who of British history.

Cousar is not so much concerned about the literary structure of Philippians. He seems more concerned about the theology and context of Philippians.

It was a great day. And I wasn't alone, as you can see in the photos above. My magical Promo Pixies turned up - three of them! They looked after my table when I needed the loo and did my talk, and generally hung around and supported me. I saw the gorgeous Damh the Bard again and was rewarded with another of his massive bear hugs, which was particularly exciting as I'd been listening to his latest album "Tales from the Crow Man" all the way up in the car. It's brilliant, by the way, and I'd thoroughly recommend it. I had a long chat with Colin and Karen Cater of Hedingham Fair, who produce stunning cards, ceramics, T-shirts and books, and who are Stonewylde fans themselves. I met lots of really interesting people including Tony Bates who photographs hares and other wildlife so beautifully, and generally had a fantastic time.

Twenty-five years of sex without being compelled to make a partnership isn’t love, it’s just sex. She could have saved her marriage and the pain she embraced (and visited on her three kids) by just owning up to it when it was discovered. A mistake, but one that she compounds with self-righteousness. But then, that’s the golden question, isn’t it? Is it more egregious to be in love with someone (and never act on it) or to engage in a sex act with someone you don’t love? I don’t know the answer. In a perfect world this would never come up, we would each be forever satisfied with our spouse, and no other person would make our pulse quicken. Years and years ago, we had a pastor who was kind of attractive in that “Jeremiah Johnson” way. He had a very plain and unhappy wife, and I imagine he’d wrestled this question more than once. He said one day “To be attracted to someone is human nature, but you don’t have to act on it.” So that was his answer, and it’s fine advice for keeping a happy home.

My name is Jane, and I am suffering from Psychotic Depression. Wanting to live is a feeling that almost never hits me. At times, I think I have everything. I live in Manhattan. I have my friends, always standing by me, and I am probably envied by many people because of my looks. Yet, I still loathe and despise myself. I have been raised thinking everything bad that happens to me is my fault, so blaming oneself has become indeed my curse. Suicidal tendencies have been haunting me, ever since I was little. In my younger years, I used to think that things would get better, but now the voices have proved my past self wrong.

Graves was one of only 30 African Americans in the country to earn the honor. During his time at U.S. Naval Academy, Graves learned Mandarin Chinese and was a member of the Navy boxing team. Graves became the first African American elected as President of the U.S. Navy Glee Club and was the first African American featured in U.S. Navy recruitment commercials.

I am still a bit rusty at this, but was so please when my rhino came to life on my paper. I need to play and experiment a little more with texture, but all in all, I think these are pretty neat for someone who hasn't held a piece of charcoal in all these years. I'd also like to try and mix this medium with watercolour and see what effects I achieve. But for now I'd like to just sit and admire this work for a while and think of how I can make it more appealing!

Which also reminded me of a couple years ago when Zachery Karmen, chief Welfare attorney of Onondaga County, and DSS Commissioner David Sutkowy, put the clients and aides in the Consumer-Directed Personal Assistant Programs being run out of Enable and Arise under constant surveillance by the Welfare Fraud Unit. When Sutkowy and Karmen were pressed to the wall in a public meeting as to why they were so harassing citizens without any evidence of wrong-doing, the guys finally confessed.
Looks like it just might be a nice day here in Ontario so hopefully I can get outside and putter around, with my left hand, in the garden. Lots of dandelions popping up according to hubby. We have this handy dandy week remover which actually works like the advertisement! You push the point into the ground beside the weed, give it a turn, pull it out, weed in all, and push a lever to remove it from the tool. If I can do all this, except hold the tool, with the left hand those weeds are history. We also have a brick driveway and hubby HATES weeds and grass growing between the bricks. So, a couple of weeks ago I mixed up a Eco-friendly weed killer and he sprayed it on, and it worked. In case you need one, here's what you do. 1 gallon of vinegar, 1 cup of salt, 1 Tablespoon of dish soap. Stir the salt into the vinegar until it dissolves, then add the soap and swish. You don't want bubbles, you just want the soap throughout the mixture to stick to the grass/weeds. Spray it on and let it go to work.

Well, first of all, what is Mexican paste and when do you use it? It is a type of fondant (icing) that is used for modelling as it holds its shape better than sugarpaste (the standard kind of roll-out icing) and it dries hard. It's made using normal icing sugar and gum tragacanth, which according to Wikipedia is "a natural gum obtained from the dried sap of several species of Middle Eastern legumes of the genus Astragalus". So now you know!
But I have one Fan that seeks me out to tell me how much she likes my blog. She tells me that unless I’m working overtime, she is very disappointed when I don’t post. And because she does that, I would do stupid, stoopid stuff for her. If she asked me to go to the supermarket and stuff steaks down my pants and bring them back, I totally would. If she insisted I came to work dressed as a different Disney Princess every day, I’d also do that. If she wanted me to eat sushi, I’d at least push it around on my plate and make it look like I took a bite, and that’s more than I’d do for my own mother. If she let me buy her a drink, I would spend all of my rent money, and we’d end up with a roll of film looking like the end of ” Bachelor Party.” She cried “in her heart” about my Crazy Closet, which I appreciate, but I’ve also had a fan cry actual tears. I’d like to think that it had nothing to do with pregnancy hormones.

With the risk of sounding pessimistic, I very much doubt that it was Mandela’s idea to take this strategic approach. A man of that age does not change his views so suddenly, without being counselled and pushed by other forces, --- must likely those who had substantial investments in South Africa. The Springbok captain was also schooled well by those operating behind the scenes.

As we got older, we took turns making a meal during the week. When I was 12, I was old enough to make dinner for the entire family. I made my fave--fried chicken! And it was good! When I was 13, I started experimenting with ingredients. I was fascinated by recipes, curious as to why we use some ingredients and not others. I looked forward to my turn to do the cooking. My family were the unwitting test subjects in my cooking creations. Their reactions told me all I needed to know.

Some sounds used in speaking Arabic are non-existent in English, and vice versa. Arabic does not use the sounds of “P” or “V,” thereby making it very difficult for Arab native speakers to pronounce these letters when speaking English. Some Arabic letters represent sounds in English that are made up of two letters like “th” and “sh.” Other sounds used in Arabic are so difficult to describe, I won’t even try. But trust me, these sounds are very difficult for English speakers to enunciate correctly.
This song, probably more than any other pop music tune, really captures the incredible vastness of our Lord. And it also captures the fact that He wants us to experience all of His glory, beauty and vastness.

The story is told from the first person perspective of a variety of narrators. I sometimes find this type of writing to be clumsy, or to feel gimmicky and unnecessary. That was certainly not the case here. There wasn’t a word or phrase out of place, and the variety of voices gave the story a much more interesting and authentic feel.
Ultimately, this is a slight beer with a massive ad campaign. A bit of a shame, too. Anyone in town who shells out $10 for this supposedly transcendent beer will almost certainly feel let down. On the other hand, if I served you a glass--with or without food--you'd probably find it quite nice. It's even worth the ten bucks. It will not, however, revolutionize gastronomy.

Beyond Caehun the road would upslope for a mile, to an inn called The White Hart. Hywel Peredur lived there in this his eleventh year, the nine hundred tenth year of Arthur's Triumph, the one thousand ninety-fifth year of Constantine's City. This March afternoon, Hywel stood on the Roman paving below the innyard, and was King of the Romans. (p. 3)In two recent reviews of SF Masterworks books posted elsewhere, Pavane and Bring the Jubilee, I touched upon the pitfalls and rewards associated with the reading of alt-histories. John M. Ford's 1983 alt-history, The Dragon Waiting, takes a different approach than those of Keith Roberts or Ward Moore. Rather than concentrating on a single modern event and extrapolating a plausible alt-future or setting a story of intrigue and curiosity within such an alt-history, Ford's work perhaps is much more radical than just a simple reimagining of the past along plausible grounds. With its magicians and vampires, perhaps The Dragon Waiting could be better described as an alt-reality in which fantastical elements co-exist with changes in the Earth's political history dating back to the mid-4th century CE.

On the flip side, not every negative comment made by an employee on social media justifies a dismissal. In the case of Whitham v Club a tribunal concluded that an employee had been unfairly dismissed for making derogatory comments about her workplace on Facebook. The comments were seen as ‘relatively minor’, and the employer’s reputation with a key client had not been damaged as a result.

A short but yet well documented book called “Sargon The Magnificent”, written in 1927 by Mrs Sydney Bristowe, illustrates the possibility that King Sargon of Babylon was in reality the Cain of Genesis. The author utilizes evidence from works by leading Assyriologists and from Babylonian inscriptions and drawings in support of her identification of Sargon of Akkad with the biblical individual called “Cain”. The author also gives evidence and reason that Ham, Nimrod's grandfather, married Naamah, who was Cain's only named female descendant. – (Genesis 4: 22).
In the Presidents mind free markets and the concept of supply and demand have nothing to do with creating the condition of higher prices. For him any solution will involve the government stepping in to invoke new regulations on the markets that he believes will solve the problem. Nowhere in his solution, however, is addressing his policies that affect the supply component other than the ones he has that hinder it.

This is a version of the principle that the violence of the oppressed cannot be equated with the violence of the oppressor, but it is a wrong and perverted version. That principle means that we should not hold the oppressed to the same standards as the oppressors in the means by which they are forced to exercise their resistance. It means we recognise their weakness, and that as a result some of their methods are more indiscriminate, sometimes more brutal. But, in making this analysis we are talking about such methods directed AT the oppressor, and which only incidentally might badly affect others. It is not an argument to be used to justify, or in any way to excuse or lessen atrocities committed by one group of the oppressed against another group of the oppressed. We do not in any way excuse, justify, or seek to lessen violence against black women by black men, for instance, by reference to the fact that black men are themselves oppressed.

Yet our students remain dedicated to the restoration of the program and to have their voices heard. This week many of them participated in walkouts and an Ethnic Studies School was created for a day by the youth of UNIDOS, where many community members and professors from the University of Arizona donated their time to teach the youth. Above all else it is their education that matters, and this massive disruption in their lives and schooling is clear proof of how their futures have been dismissed and marginalized by local and state officials. The good news is that they are resilient and we all will continue to ensure that their future dreams are not compromised by the pettiness and spite of the tragic few that made this deplorable and shameful decision.

During his career, Mays appeared in 24 All-Star games. He won the 1951 Rookie of the Year award, as well as the National League MVP award in 1954 and 1965. He was the MVP of the All-Star game in 1963 and 1968 (back when players actually played most of the game: he played all nine innings of an All-Star game 11 times). He was ranked second to Babe Ruth among the 100 greatest baseball players of 20th Century by "The Sporting News" in 1999. ESPN ranked him eighth in their ranking of the top 50 athletes of the 20th Century. He will always be remembered as one of the best ever to play the game.

The ones in which the hospital is not disguised, however, always take my breath away. In a bad way.

To provide you, dear reader, with the 12 photos you see of the sweater on that post, I took over 500 shots. I usually take at least 40 to 50 shots for every one photo that ends up on the blog or Ravelry. I know people like to throw around the saying “It’s quality, not quantity” but in this case, quantity improves your chances for quality. That having been said, I don’t mean take 400 pictures of the same thing. Every single one of my photos is slightly different, the angle, the pose, the exposure, and every once in while you hit that one in a million shot. Once you have the photos you need, there is also no reason to keep shooting, expect for fun of course!

But then there’s Westfeldt. She feels so self-conscious, almost to the point of fading out of view. As a director she gives her co-star much more time to develop than she gives her own character. During a key point in the story — when she’s had a baby and is dieting/ exercising madly to get back into shape for dating, so she can find “the one” (I know, I know, just bear with me for a sec) — she seems to recede entirely into a placeholder. Like her character, Westfeldt seems so preoccupied with looking like she’s 29 rather than her real-life 42, so eager to dodge the humanizing and humbling close-up, that the film gets weaker all around. Is this what happens to a beautiful and talented woman whose male partner rises up to Sexiest Man Alive status?

In 1984 AT&T in exchange for government permission to enter the computer equipment business agreed to a breakup of its subsidiaries into several Regional Baby Bells. The breakup was very beneficial for consumers and resulted in greater competition. Unfortunately, in the 2000s AT&T Corp., as it came to be known was allowed to re-merge with two of the original Baby Bells from the Ma Bell System: SBC Communications and later Bell South. Another Baby Bell MCI eventually become part of Verizon Communications which is a co-owner of Verizon Wireless.

My exuberance for the bourbon prompted Mary Ellen to buy the bottle as a gift for me. We left the store and I stowed the bottles she purchased in the back of my Element and we headed off to Gueros for margaritas prior to a stop at High Ball for dinner.

Lest you misunderstand, my allergy is still alive and well. Oh, I still lapse into convulsive fits when around smokers in restaurants or amusement parks or ballgames, but never once in church with Gina. That’s bling, sister!
Draw something is pretty much pictionary but without the ability to shout and mock how crap someones drawing is along the way (even with the 140 character upgrade)
When half or more of the population is on sensation numbing "anti-depressants" to suppress their despair at the state of their world, then the very idea of progress goes from laughable to demonic.
The concept behind it is extraordinary. It reminds me of London, and of the feeling I get when I walk down its streets and see all the different styles: "the freedom of being different, maybe weird, but unique".
But, Ismail is ready with an historical precedent to justify this siding with Imperialism too. In the American Revolution you see,
The second substantive question faced by the Board was whether the evidence was sufficient to establish that FERN MICHAELS functions as a mark. There was no doubt that FERN MICHAELS has been used as the author's name for a series of books, and so the question became whether Applicant could meet either the Polar Music or the Scholastic test.
J. JS Lee (Jackie Lee) is one of those designer that make garments that look pretty basic at first sight. But when looking a bit closer, you'll find details that make them everything but plain. Like the slightly assymetric blazer-dress or the use of laqué fabric in a suit. I first discovered her when visiting London Fashion Week earlier this year, as I arrived at the exhibition area her team was just unpacking the fw12 collection that came fresh from the runway. (Will share those snapshots as soon as I'm ready to talk about winter ;) )

Thousands of years and many suburban miles stretch between a visceral dependence upon divine grace and my dependence upon a purse-sized agenda. If God’s will dampens my path or inhibits the pace of my plans, I get frazzled. I fail to notice how His inconveniences nourish and reshape my heart, mind, and life. He showers me with unexpected blessings, and I huff at the lesser events which seem washed away. God never withholds a good thing from His beloved children unless He washes it aside to make room for something better. A farmer understands the value of soaking rains to soften hulls. Though it once seemed vital, the hull falls away and vanishes into the earth. The Son shines on tender shoots from the transformed seed, growing it toward abundant life.
It is not and will never be a "pigment liner."
I suppose everything went as well as could be expected. At least it was for me. I think other people might have had different feelings on the subject.

Once a headline has drawn a reader to the newspaper’s Web site, a well-written story blurb can help turn one page view into many more. Similar to drop heads, story blurbs are one or two sentences below the headline that give readers a sense of what the story is about. Good story blurbs are timely, highlight key information and provide details that pique reader interest.
If America allows Zionists to take over the media then that too goes against the first amendment. These were rights ratified in 1791 and what have you seen in the last 200+ years? Constant wars. In the Arab world we have lived in constant wars through out our time. Every generation of Arabs have been involved in wars. This doesnt mean we lack democracy. Democracy is a political aspect of the west and we have respected it for a long time, why cant they respect ours?
The worrying thing for the oligarchs, though, is that the workers in the ‘workers state’ are starting to get restive, demanding trade union rights and kicking against corrupt officialdom and unscrupulous capitalist entrepreneurs. Even Mao receives the occasional brick-bat, thrown at his mooning face! Never mind; I expect they will all cheer up when The Great Exploit of Building the Party finally makes it to their local multiplex.
Anarene's already fragile infrastructure begins to unfurl after Sam's passing, shattering the town's economic foundation and Sonny and Duane's moral centers. They get in a brawl over Jacy while Sonny struggles to maintain the pool hall, Jacy finally leaves town after a failed getaway with Sonny, and the prior concession stand attendant loses grip in her newly acquired position of cinema management. Ever so gently, the collapse of this specific small town becomes a metaphor for anyone's childhood home and the juncture in one's life when he must confront the passing on of traditions and the modernization of property and society. It's a subtext that is liberated from nostalgic sentimentality, reflected in Duane and Sonny's unassuming final trip to the cinema and their quiet resignation to the shifting flow of life. Furthermore, it's an elegiac memorial to an old tradition of filmmaking, and filters its coming-of-age trajectory through a variety of larger shifts in American cultural heritage (its setting is lumped in the calm between World War II and the Korean Conflict). The film's modest echoes of the classical Hollywood era and the Western genre are indicative of a passing age, whereas the death of those values signals the ushering in of a new, uncertain future.

This is definitely one of the stranger discoveries I've seen. The idea here is that holding something cold in your hands, such as a near frozen water bottle, sort of wicks the heat away from your body, and cools the blood as it circulates through your hands. It works to make the person more comfortable, able to exercise longer and more efficiently, and in the end, burn more calories. In the recent research being done, they're was a significant difference when cooling the hands, even reducing a 1.5 mile run by 5 minutes! The fun thing about this one, is you can test it yourself and immediately see if you notice a difference.
A funny thing happened while I was dancing my heinie (sp?) off at a club in Montenegro: My boob fell out. Actually, it wasn't my boob. It was a piece of boob-shaped silicone I strategically place inside my dress to give the illusion of big boobs. I sat down with my dear friends for drinks that evening and K says to me, "Uhmmm Jenn, nice boobs. What's going on in there?" Guess it was pretty obvious. I divulged my dirty little secret and we chuckled. At one point, I was close to pulling one out for her to see as she had never seen one before. Turns out, I didn't need to. As I was hopping about in the club with Dear Friend #2, FLING! And to my utter horror, a chick next to me reached down to pick it up and hand it back to me. Pretty sure my hubby was more horrified than I was. We left shortly afterwards...boob in purse.

We made plans to hang out on the weekend, and we did. Had very stimulating (non-sexual) conversation...the guy was intelligent, mature, single and hot as fuck! Things were definitely looking up. By the time we retired to the bedroom, I was mentally smitten and ready to see if he would measure up in bed. And...sweet jesus...did he measure up! He started by making me strip for him and then had me bend over so he could suck the "what the fuck?!" out of my pussy. He was using a glass dildo-like object in my pussy while licking it and then he moved up to my asshole and proceded cause me to be numb from the waist down. Just when I was close to collapsing, he flipped me over and attempted to go back in. I had to buy myself some time to regain my composure, so it was the perfect opportunity to have him lay on his back and whip out my fantastic fellatio skills.

The intrusion might have been more tolerable if it had been clearly labeled as the commercially funded promotion it was. Instead it came in the form of a veiled product placement inviting Channel 13 viewers to support Channel 13 by venturing to the arena to see an Andrea Bocelli concert. It even made it seem that those Channel 13 viewers going to the arena at the station’s behest would be joining more closely to bond with the Channel Thirteen family.
Having access to a car and thanks to the trusty GPS I had no trouble finding the beach which is on the edge of a residential development and has carparking and a cafe that overlooks the beach and the ocean.

Tim Gaffney was the PIO for the Pinal County Sheriff's Office and without my permission used my photographs in a controversial letter addressed to several mayors in Arizona border cities. Again, we have law enforcement officers betraying our trust. Tim Gaffney is no longer the PCSO's PIO. Gaffney was promoted and a new "propaganda minister" was hired from a local TV station.

Still reeling the Lexow smackdown, Tammany Hall could only watch their ambitions fold. Against Strong they put up Nathan Straus of Macy's Department Store as their candidate; within two weeks, he resigned, fearing business reprisals. They replaced him with former mayor Grant, but he was no match against the fusion ticket and alliance of German and Jewish voters, which easily swept Strong into office.

There may be few greater skills in football management than knowing when to leave. Stay on too long and no matter how successful you may have been, you open yourself up to accusations of having “lost the plot” and the like. Leave too soon and the talk will be of unfinished business and unrealised potential. Hop around clubs too often and you’re a short term mercenary, stay in one place to long and you lack drive and ambition for new challenges. It’s not easy.

After careful examination of the petitioners’ complaint, We find the statements under the introductory affirmative allegations, as well as the specific averments under the sub-heading CAUSE OF ACTION, to be adequate enough to show, prima facie, the claimed violation of their rights. On the basis thereof, they may thus be granted, wholly or partly, the reliefs prayed for. It bears stressing, however, that insofar as the cancellation of the TLAs is concerned, there is the need to implead, as party defendants, the grantees thereof for they are indispensable parties.
If you have any cause for concern as to the manner in which someones affairs are being conducted, ask the hard questions early. If you don't get satisfactory answers you may wish to explore the possibility of an application to VCAT to cancel the Power of Attorney and have someone else appointed.

I will say this much for what followed: it was extremely interesting, and would have convinced the Reincarnationists that their day of justification had arrived. During the next two hours, Chief Rain-in-the-Face told us all about what had happened to Henry Hudson after he had sailed on his last voyage up the river that now bears his name; while Mr. Black and Mr. McScribe furnished us with some interesting sidelights in the lives of several prominent personages at the courts of Louis XIV and Henry VIII respectively. All in all, it was a morning well spent.
Jack has given up puttering in a garage, having friends who are available for a bike ride or a face to face chat. He's given up mountain biking, and spending time with his grandparents. For the most part, Jack has given up time away from his parents. That's pretty important for a teen searching for independence. There's not a lot of places to go to be truly away from your parents in a boat. Sure, you can take the dinghy to the beach, or go for a hike alone, but there's not a lot to do. We have gone months without even seeing another teenager. It can be a pretty lonely existence for a young teen.

Our 25 hour crossing from the Big Island was interesting. Crossing 20 miles off the Alenuihaha channel (between the Big Island and Maui) was challenging on an extremely calm day. I can't imagine what it is like when the trade winds are roaring. Doug's words "that was ugly" as he is trying to keep things from flying around the cabin. But, after the ugly phase, we had some great sailing, which turned into calm motoring. So, we did all right.

I know I hardly ever combine challenges and cards, but this one just seemed to fit the bill for all of them without me even thinking about it until it was done. :)
Do I still believe Satan doesn’t exist? I don’t know. All I know is that Satan wasn’t the one whose body I remember being pinned under. Satan wasn’t the one who took my virginity that endless summer when my head should have been filled with anticipation over my soon-to-come first day of school. But if he does exist, I certainly don’t think he had any objections.

Judge Baird, by contrast, for his dissent in Criner and his decision to speak out about it upon leaving the court, merits recognition as virtually the father of Texas DNA exonerations. It was his testimony before Congress that brought a national spotlight to the case, leading Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch to call the court's ruling "outrageous." Unlike Judge Keller, Baird acknowledged how it would impact jurors' decision if, instead of pointing to guilt, scientific evidence showed the defendant "didn't

As I detailed in an earlier article, Britain and her Empire had a greater role than any other in bringing about the end of slavery in most of the world. Whereas, in Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, the black messiah of the Rastafarian faith, did not get around to ending slavery in the Rastafarian holy land of Ethiopia until 1932, and even then the “Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, King of Kings of Ethiopia and Elect of God” was less motivated by the humanitarian zeal which drove the British abolitionists, but by the somewhat more practical consideration that the league of nations would not let him join if he didn't.
I'm kind of glad Nadia (Ornella Marcucci), Diana's gym-owning best friend, shows up to break the news that her Aunt has died, because I don't think I could take much more of that lingerie shop. Of course, I'm not saying I'm glad her Aunt died, as she seemed, as we'll find out later, to be a pretty cool chick, it's just that I was starting to a feel a little woozy. Anyway, it's time to go Venice and attend the reading of her will. Damn, can't this woman go anywhere without hitting on dudes...hard (she offers a million lire to a couple of male train passengers to fuck her in the ass).

I gave the owner, Pierre, my card. I hope that he reads this post because it wasn't just the wait for food that was bothersome. A lengthy wait (even with reservations) can be overlooked if the service and food was fantastic. The experience from start to finish was problematic. Reservations should have been honored. My beer should not have been warm. Food orders should be placed soon after they are taken, not after 15 minutes. It is a shame for a popular restaurant to have such atrocious service issues.

Back to the Red Hill battle: the question of which politics will be honoured, legitimized and tolerated is precisely what is in play. Should the expressway be built just because the duly elected Hamilton City Council has decided that it should be? Should protesters back off because Hamilton's city fathers are seeking a court injunction to end the protests and criminalize the native people and activists who have been delaying construction these past three weeks? What is your civic duty?
So, I have a really hard time keeping my existentialists apart. Much of their philosophy is similar — much of it revolves around liberty and freedom of choice, and after a while they all kind of blur together.

“…in the patient’s warped mind-set, each new piece of gun-control legislation is oddly rationalized to be merely one additional step in an ultimate plot by the federal government to confiscate guns altogether.

With the spacious patio, they were considerably busier than the Other Place due to the pleasant weather the night we visited. Not a great beer selection, though they did have Tank 7 on tap. Pretty friggin’ douchetastic on the people front. Service was very friendly, though they appeared to be understaffed the night I was there.
But it was certainly worthy of bragging rights, and they proceeded to reward themselves with steaming bowls of winter stew, gallons of Mama’s coffee and two whole sweet potato pies, besting each others’ stories between mouthfuls.
Somehow I’m reminded of the birth of my son. It was long and difficult;… over 36 hours. Yet then… there he was;… just the top of his head emerging from his mother’s loins. Its called “crowning”. And that’s how I saw John, last time I saw him. He was “crowning”. Out of the flesh of his body, his spirit was clearly crowning.
Giving details of the case, Mr. Varadaraju said Elango was employed in a grocery owned by Saravanan in Tirupur. When Saravanan’s niece P. Selvalakshmi (18) came to the shop on a few occasions, Elango befriended her and the two fell in love.
Having been listening to the new Girls record a lot recently, I think there are a lot of similarities to be made between the two bands. The instrumentation is catchy but simply constructed. Lower Dens are also a perfect band if you’ve recently discovered the splendour of Wye Oak. The lyrics are fully hipster. And the vocals are of such a similar style. Although, yes, Jana Hunter is a chick and Christopher Owens sure isn’t. It’s a great sound, a sort of indie lo-fi, which can at times scan sound like surf pop and at others sound far darker.
Which leads us to a question brimming with potential and overflowing with possibilities. Suppose you used the second method of bending a spoon, and just brought your arm muscles into play to give it a bit of a twist, but then – and this is the clever bit – you use some cunning misdirection of some sort, and dress it up as an example of the first method, to make it look like you’re demonstrating psychic powers.

I am so glad to see spring and warm weather. Not that winter was that horrible this year- I just love to see the leaves on the trees and the flowers. Not so much the weeds. Why do the weeds always come back before the flowers? I keep telling myself that dandelions are pretty flowers too. That idea is not spreading to my neighbors half as quickly as my dandelions are.

Eric was supposed to leave in October (to California) for 6 weeks. It's a pre-deployment training called Mojave Viper. His command found out about my C Section, and told him today that he is to stay home! I won't be able to lift anything or drive for 4 weeks prior to the surgery, so I was really wondering how I was going to make it through having a newborn, appointments, possible emergencies, etc. ALONE! Now, thanks to a wonderful Lt. Colonel who had vowed to be more family oriented, that weight has been lifted.

We know that the most ancient humans of all, lived off the land, not by tilling it, but by eating the roots and shoots and fruits and leaves and any animals they could easily catch. Even today, the remotest of tribes who have managed to escape ‘civilzation’ live that way, live as hunter-gatherers. In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India, the Sentinelese, the Jarawa and the Onge live like that even today.

This is a brilliant and well-researched work, yet myopic and simple-minded. Waldman finds it odd that a small poor nation like Pakistan would defend its interests via a “double-game”, using “duplicity.” Why not take a principled and forthright stand, facing the Anglo-American tools of destabilization, assassination, and regime overthrow? He speaks of “enemies” as if this was a children’s game of good guy – bad guy — not the most useful perspective for a hegemonic power playing the great game on the other side of the world.

Last week while visiting with our daughter and her family for Thanksgiving, Christy and I were again discussing a book that she claims "has changed my life." In the course of this conversation, she made a statement that has not left me. She said, "There is no way a person can read this book and not be changed, if they have a servant's heart." She does by the way. But I immediately thought, "Do I?"

Critics will throw raw numbers around showing how businesses devoured others or formed monopolies during the Gilded Age, but they rarely get into the details. Some businesses were aided by government to form de-facto coercive monopolies, while others got gobbled up because they could not compete, contributing to the statistics showing shrinking numbers of businesses in a given industry.

But right now, it's beautifully sunny, and there are roads to walk and trees to hug and wind to listen to and buds to gently-ever so gently-touch, and pictures to take. Any more heavy thinking can wait for a while.
Perhaps a better argument would have been that making prints from the negative without owning the copyright would constitute copyright infringement – however, this would involve accepting that the prints are genuine Adams, a position that the Trust was surprisingly reluctant to accept.
Maybe because my ‘exercise threshold’ is so low, I can get a kind of endorphin-like rush simply from walking. Perhaps ‘rush’ is too strong a word though. More like a mild sensation of freedom. My muscles feel like they’re waking up from a long slumber and stretching their toes beneath the end of the blanket.
This would not be a true update if I were not to share a step backwards that happened this week. I did have my "corner of shame" looking SOOO much better, it was almost completely cleared out. Just needed to find a spot for hubby's extra drawers (which will most likely end up in the closet once we finish getting rid of it.
Well its, finally here. This is my last week as a member of the Speedy the Fox Challenge Team. So for this week's challenge at the Speedy the Fox Challenge Blog , I've made it very easy - the challenge is to create "using a square card"!. Now that doesn't mean a normal sized card (or any other kind of card) with a square on it LOL...but a true square card!
It would have been exquisite to watch her bring herself to orgasm, but I could not take the pleasure of watching any longer. I bent closer, trailing her finger with my tongue, tasting where her finger traced. She led my tongue around the landscape of her cunt, hovering on the lips, then at the dip where the lips meet and close over her clit, and then her hand was gone and I made her come the first time with my mouth.
They actually said that. I think it's ridiculous. High school (and everything else) is what you make of it. I'm just encouraging him to do his best and have fun.

She sighed and her shoulders drooped, but she smiled up at me. "You have until Sedonia's wedding. That's your two months. In the meantime start dating one of the girls from the possible candidates."
I hear the two of them messing about and it's clear she has much better things to do than come and talk to me about stuff that happened years ago. There's a bunch of giggles before she carries on speaking.

For the record, I am not blond, I have told my share of blond jokes and will do so again. I have a great sense of humor and will continue to find blond jokes funny, along with other jokes. But I am not 12, nor am I responsible for a class full of 12 year olds. I did remind him, and will remind him again, that her singling out people to make fun of their appearance is bullying, and told him that what she did was wrong. Again reminding him he has my permission to respectfully call her out on that (or, if he so chooses, he can skip the respect part and use the phrasing I suggested).
It may be the cheese most able to illustrate a “barnyard” taste, so for me, it has merit on that basis.

Wen has long been known as a reform-minded leader and has been outspoken on the need to modernise China’s financial system to help sustain economic growth. His views are not always shared by the rest of the leadership in Beijing, and it was unclear whether Tuesday’s comments reflected a broader consensus.

Ah, how I love receiving that follow-up question. Each and every time, I'll respond with, "actually, I love salad." I then adore watching the person's facial transformation - twisting mouth and furrowing brow - as he or she becomes even more confused. If the person does not immediately conclude that I am simply delusional, I will begin my usual - salads-don't-need-lettuce rant.
No doubt this will be but a footnote in the ANC's diary, but I think it worth a mention for a variety of reasons. The Union was the result of nine years of negotiations between the various political factions in the formerly diverse colonies, and in my view the Union represented a great victory for common sense and peacemaking following a destructive and bitter war.
So what is courage? It’s not the absence of fear. Courage is overcoming a natural fear. Courage means saying yes to right action even at risk of pain or loss, just as Chuck did during Watergate.

In my first read through I could see that a reader would think one of two things. I was a horrible writer who couldn't keep my character in character. Or, my main character was really dumb. I wasn't going for either one of those so I had to rewrite those parts so my main character notices the changes but has a reason to ignore them.
I woke up two hours late this morning. I guess I haven’t really figured out how my new alarm works. Thank goodness my outfit was preselected. I’ve got greasy hair and minimal make-up, though, so be kind in the comments. By skipping a shower and my usual, lengthy make-up routine, I made up enough time to only be one hour late to work.

Each day when you wake up you get a chance to choose what type of day you will have. You can choose to have a good or a bad day. Agreed, life can throw things at you when you least expect it, however it remains your choice as to how you deal with them.

My father Berl Olswanger was a professional musician. I grew up listening to him practice the scales on the piano almost two hours every day. If he took a vacation, or he was sick, he made up the time. When I heard him practice, I felt as though everything in my world was right. The sound of the scales soothed me. My father had a dance band and sometimes they rehearsed in our home, so I got to hear that music also. I felt lucky to have original music in my life, to know musicians, and especially to have a parent who made a living in an unconventional way. He taught me by his example that it was possible to live outside the box.
Brazil cannot claim to be solely responsible for the drop in the real. Global risk appetite has turned against emerging markets amid political turmoil over the European sovereign debt crisis. Commodities prices have softened from their highs in line with decelerating Chinese growth.
It has 68 choromosones whereas the modern horse has only 66 chromosomes. It also has faint striping on its legs which is a sign that it is a more ancient species. Scientists believe that it and the modern horse diverged from each other some 160,000 years ago.

I would be curious to hear how your thoughts about self-publishing have changed over the past several years. I think I recall that you used to think it was not such a good idea, but over time you seem to have warmed to it more and more. It's interesting, and I suspect that it reflects a gradual shift in everyone's thinking, not just yours.
A few weeks ago I mentioned that I was feeling the need for a little réparation to the skin, hair and body after the rigours of winter... The same goes for my wardrobe. It needs a little spring clean, a make over, a smarten up... So here is what I am thinking...

Speaking of advice, I could’ve used some myself back at the dance. Ella Simmons had already succeeded in ruining my arrival. Sensing my seething anger, Josh took me by the hand and led me into the doors of Hoffman High. I was determined not to let Ella rain on my parade for the rest of that night. So I sighed, flung my hair over my shoulder in a miniature act of defiance, and turned to Josh with a smile I hoped wasn’t too tight-lipped.

I've been handed a crack team of ladies, or maybe a team of crack ladies, who are actually doing the work-work. They have all been plucked from the mundane obscurity of the giant call center just for my project, and are considered the cream of the call center crop. My role involves assigning tasks, doing the analysis as the project moves along, and to my surprise, a large degree of coaching, babysitting and mentoring.
They may be small increments, but these changes are exciting for me. I want to tone up and fit into my old clothes so bad. I want to feel fit and strong, not bluppy and lumpy. This is the second weigh-in in a row that I’ve logged losses in key areas of my body, which makes me feel validated in my optimism about this project and our progress with it. I think the next phase is to increase our physical activity to further boost our metabolism.

Nanny statism, of course, is what happens when the government takes the regulation of morality away from bishops and gives it to doctors, social workers and professional experts. Cameron champions personal responsibility, but proposals like these suggest that he instinctively doesn't trust people to make their own decisions. His clumsy, ill-directed moralism is increasingly irritating, even to many Conservatives.
Our friendship is what He wants the most. He wants us to spend time with Him. A friend is someone you can always turn to for help.

But for the last few days, we had the younger, more homebody side of Gillen at thirteen. He wanted to plan the preparations and help with the cooking.

The next is factor A which is the gene for patterning. There are 6 different pattern possibilities. Solid pattern is the most recessive and white pattern is the most dominant. I learned studying this that Draga does not have the badger face gene. She has the spotting gene and I think she also has the mouflon gene. Mouflon is the opposite of badger face. Mouflon is a dark sheep with a white belly and stripe going up to the bottom of the jaw. It is hard to tell exactly because of her spots. But I am pretty sure she is both spotted and mouflon. But spots are not a pattern gene.
This can be any classic work, from Alcott to Zola. Always fancied trying Great Expectations, or finally feel like tackling Jane Eyre? Now's your chance! From the fun to the frightening, the gentle satire to the all-out swashbuckling epic, there are hundreds of years' worth of books to choose from.
What season are we on? Five. Already? In the show it is nine months on from the end of the last season (18 months I think, for the viewer). Don is now married, Joanie is now with child. As usual everyone is worried about their position. But this is Mad men, and watching everyone try to appear comfortable, whilst struggling to maintain some thing or other from their lives, is all part of the fun. Well that and the sixties setting. We are now in 1965 and the sixties as presented in “sixties nostalgia” (i.e before I was born) is finally beginning. This also means civil rights protests. This episode cleverly opened using a real life incident as reported in the New York times, where agency Young & Rubicam thought it was amusing to pick on, play tricks on, some of the protesters. The “And they call us savages” quote also came from the story. Clever as Don and co placed an ad in the paper about them being an equal opportunities employer which led Joan to visit, worried about her position, and many black people to turn up expecting a job to be available. It is this mix of real life events and fiction which give an authentic and fun appeal to the show.

I try to keep it as short as possible and I usually even remind them (ahead of time) that they aren’t going to learn any physics while I’m up there talking. They’ll start learning it once they play with the words and ideas themselves and put them into action.

Ed Lindsay is an irritable bachelor in his late fifties. He lives in a dull boarding house where much of his time is consumed watching what he calls worthless and mindless programs. Not able to take it anymore, Ed retrieves his old radio from storage in the basement. When Ed was younger and happier, he enjoyed the radio and was one of his favorite forms of entertainment. Ed brought the radio to his room and plugged it in. He was amazed as to what he heard playing. It was programs from the 30′s and 40′s from big bands no longer alive. He tried to tell the others of his miraculous radio, but when he turned it on for them, all they heard was static. By making several phone calls, he found that the radio station he was listening to was off the air for over 13 years.
Biodiversity conservation has thus become a global concern. These conservation strategies involve the preservation of the land and water bodies, controlling the destruction of forests, restricting pollution levels in the rivers and the seas, maintaining the natural habitat of the animals and birds, the preservation of the native species of the land and introduction of missing or endangered species. Often gene banks are created where diverse genetic material is collected. This is then introduced into the natural habitat as and when appropriate.

So I don’t know what will happen. College football has changed, and not just because Nebraska, Colorado and Utah are in difference conferences. Something is in the air this season, something dangerous and palpable. But I can’t figure it. Only the elected can smell what it is, only the privileged are allowed a glimpse into the murky depths of the future. I’m just a poor pillar of salt looking back on what went before, knowing I ought not to but helpless to do anything else. It’s all still there: the people, the victories, the betrayals, the loss. Unlike Abraham, Lot’s nameless wife was incapable of that exuberant, terrible faith necessary for paradise. She looked back, and so did I, and what we saw made us both wonder whether the price of such devotions was worth it.

Some excerpts from Ben Szobody's in-depth piece titled, No presidential candidate has excited young evangelicals:It’s not the loudest group of voters, but the fate of the 2012 presidential race and even the future fortunes of the Republican Party may partly hinge on a swelling group of independents loosely defined as young evangelical Christians.
Earning the # 2 spot in day 2′s top 3 was the overall epicness and energy that went down in the Heineken Dome. For some reason people do not know about the Dome as it serves as a mini beer garden in one part and a sweet dance party in the other dome. The sounds that go down in here range from minimal techno, disco techno, to electro house. There is air conditioning in there and a mesmerizing light show that is projected onto the roof of the Dome. People in here are full of energy and it is a never ending dance party. You can walk through here at any point throughout the day and it will be raging. By far the best kept secret about Coachella.

I guess that's true. For instance, "Clay" has a similar structure. That was kind of a leap-forward song, we were like, "wow! We can turn off the distortion boxes! How about that!" It's not super sophisticated. I don't understand post-rock. It's one of those terms like grunge that I feel is not descriptive of anything but has gotten applied to stuff. To me, I thought post-rock was supposed to be like Tortoise, and I don't think that really has any bearing on what we're doing. I just hoped people dug it and that it was meaningful.
