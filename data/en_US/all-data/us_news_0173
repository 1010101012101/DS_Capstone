Devotees of the series will bristle at this notion, but devotees also have a way of gatekeeping their loves by convincing you that you need a completist understanding of something to enjoy it properly. I once was checking out at a Best Buy, purchasing “Halo 2.” The cashier assured me that if I didn’t read some novel connected to the series I “wouldn’t understand what’s going on” and “wouldn’t get it.” Hey man, I came to Best Buy specifically to avoid reading anything. The creators of the game know many people will pick up “Mass Effect 3” for the first time without ever setting foot into the “Mass Effect” universe first.

Yes, the Patriots did trade down twice after the first round and wound up making seven picks, but those two first-round upward moves went against the grain. Perhaps it's a sign that coach Bill Belichick is focusing even more on the present than he has during previous offseasons.

Mr. President, forgive me for being blunt, but when it comes to economic affairs, you're out of your depth. Unlike you, I am not a career politician. Unlike you, I've spent more than two decades working in the private sector, starting new businesses and turning around failing ones. Undoing the damage you've done will be a daunting challenge. But I've learned a thing or two about how government policies can kill private investment and stifle job creation and I have a plan to get government out of the way.

Cooking fish at home can be a welcome alternative for those who are stuck in a chicken and pasta rut, and it's not as scary as it seems. This recipe is inspired by a delicious dish my dad makes. The almonds add a crunchy, nutty flavor to the flaky halibut, and the addition of a little honey mustard gives an unexpected hint of sweetness. I served it with simply grilled asparagus and wild rice, but feel free to pair it with whatever you're craving that day. –Carly Goldsmith

It's tempting to view Sandler's double duty here, as annoyer and annoyed, as a grand comic riff on his life's work as seen by his critics. But that would charitably suggest a measure of humorous forethought typically absent from the A-lister's point-and-laugh approach to mockery and monastic belief that his raspy screaming — now in two flavors: high-pitched and higher-pitched — is inherently funny.

Espiritu Santo-style moquecas, based as they are on olive oil, seafood and vegetables, illustrate the Portuguese side of Brazilian cooking rather than the more African-influenced moquecas of Bahia state to the north, where cooks enrich the stews with coconut milk and the palm fruit oil called dende.

First, the setup from Robert Wright, writing at The Atlantic online: “If the Supreme Court rules against President Obama on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, there’s a sense in which he’ll deserve it.

He calls this the "politics of sight," and Pachirat's blood-soaked experience inside a slaughterhouse spotlights only the most illustrative example of how we've divorced ourselves from the means of producing violence -- and how, in doing so, we have made it psychologically easier to support such brutality.

"Midsummer" is a complicated comedy because it tells three different stories. Titania and her husband, the noble king Oberon (Robert Mitchell), are quarreling, upsetting the fairy kingdom, which holds court in the woods. In a nearby city, four young lovers (Courtney Brown, Patrese D. McClain, Anthony Peeples and Chauncy Thomas) are involved in the kind of "I-love-him-but-he-loves-her" relationships that are the hallmark of farce, and high school. Meanwhile, workmen are struggling to produce a pageant to honor the wedding of the city's ruler and his bride (also played by Mitchell and Parks).
Why they’re here: So QB Kirk Cousins is gone; a big blow, yes—but not to the point of knocking this team from the nation’s elite.

Baum also provided various details, such as where he was coming from and his speed, that later were found to be accurate.

TRUSCOTT: I nominate Gov. Snyder in the positive category. For a political novice, he's surprised people, shown remarkable political skills and very strong leadership. More important, he's changed the tone in Lansing. He stays above the fray, focuses on his agenda and gets things done. Roadblocks don't slow him down.

Contrary to perception, home-schooled children do not necessarily lack social interaction. Tim had plenty of friends through church and sports and said home schooling enabled him to interact better with adults. Because he wasn't around a classroom full of kids, in many ways he didn't act like a kid. He was often around adults. In social settings, adults know how to be polite and can demonstrate manners, at least moreso than kids.

"I rarely say it is important and wish you respected that by getting a hold of me quickly."
"I can deal with it now," he says. "You need to get down there and figure out what happened, why it happened, and what you can do now to deal with it. It's a long process."

As union officials gloat, “while nearly every other union . . . had their retirement age pushed back to 63, we were successful” in keeping a retirement age of 55 after 25 years’ worth of work. Nor did the TWU have to pay anything extra to make up for this privilege.

Medunjanin is charged in the plot to bomb New York City subway cars in September 2009. Two of his old classmates from Flushing High School pleaded guilty in the case and testified against Medunjanin, but his defense lawyer said Medunjanin never signed on to be a "suicide bomber" for Al Qaeda.
The hospital allots $150,000 annually for murals. If an interior-design team, Curran says, looks holistically at art availability throughout a facility during planning, "it can be done on a shoestring budget. It doesn't have to be expensive if you're doing some of the work yourself and it comes from your soul."
1 teaspoon Italian seasoning (coarsely ground by spice grinder is best)
Austin loved the dime-store business. At lunch, he would sketch his newest idea for the next display on paper napkins, said his son Glenn Austin, 54, of Oviedo.

The only thing close to a "phablet" on the market today is the Samsung Galaxy Note, a smart phone with a 5.3-inch display - not quite into tablet territory, but getting close. Samsung, like Apple, makes phones and tablets, so it, too, is in danger of losing phone sales to a hybrid device. But the Galaxy Note appears to be a big winner. Samsung says it's sold 5 million of the things since it was released in October.

Dear Dave: Elway's was happy to share its recipe for this flavorful (and completely vegan) charred red pepper soup. I liked adding a little crumbled fresh cheese for garnish (which makes it not vegan but still vegetarian), but you can top it however you wish.
Expansion of the district will come up for a July vote in the council. Wednesday, downtown resident Skip Frank urged the council to include the six blocks around the Safeway. In the two decades since the district's creation, those six blocks have undergone a metamorphosis, especially with the construction of the two high-rise condo towers the Eliot and the Benson. The streetcar, too, brings in much more traffic to the area, Frank said.
As brand-name advertisers fight for attention in a cluttered media landscape, they're turning increasingly to celebrities such as Robert Downey Jr. (Nissan), Jeff Bridges (Hyundai) and Tim Allen (Chevrolet) to pitch their products.

"You sure?" Datsyuk asked.
There wasn't much ease in the playing of violists Jonathan Vinocour and Yun Jie Liu, following one another through Bach's tight-canon passages. Here and there, from movement to movement, the ensemble's rhythmic dovetailing was imprecise. Textures, again, were murky, and one had to wonder whether the players were even paying attention to Glover, whose elegant gestures seemed like an independent show.

"If we had more public hearings and more scrutiny, that would help — it would directly counter narrow-interest bills," Beall said. With deeper, nonpartisan analysis, Beall added, "we would be able to understand the bills better and maybe ferret out some of the sneaky things that are added into the bills that benefit individuals."
The women talked about the warm weather and the flowers starting to push up from the ground. They discussed what they had read in the newspaper that day. Promnitz showed them a photo of her grandson, and the women gushed over his red locks.
-- Post to a review site. Skytrax, the British-based site that claims to be the "world's leading airline and airport review site," posts reviews submitted by travelers through its airlinequality.com site. TripAdvisor, the giant in the hotel review space, also accepts and scores airline reviews. Seatguru.com accepts reviews (and complaints) about airline seating. And several guidebook and magazine sites also provide for traveler reviews and complaints. The advantage of dealing with a big review site is that far more interested travelers have access to your submission than through sites with a narrower focus.
Suicide is the third leading cause of death among college students after accidents and homicides, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Nearly 14 percent of high school students say they have seriously considered suicide.
The Heat jumped to an 8-1 lead, holding the Knicks without a basket for almost 4 minutes to start the game. Then Stoudemire had three baskets in a 12-2 spurt to give the Knicks the lead, and they were up 20-18 after one quarter following two free throws by Anthony with 7.3 seconds left.

Durbin said he will send the Tribune series to the key federal agencies involved in hunting international fugitives and then urgently "bring them together and see if we can come up with a list of things we can do to make this change."
It is fascinating stuff, and there is not nearly enough space here to do it justice, but the salient point is this: Matthew Vines is not some godless heathen lobbing bombs at Christianity from outside its walls. No, he lives inside Christianity's walls, still holds the faith in which he was raised. So this is not an outsider's attack. It is an insider's plea.
Dear Margo: I have a friend, "Sally," who years ago went through infertility issues with her husband. After several years, they elected to use an egg donor and successfully had three beautiful children (who look mostly like daddy). Now, years later, when discussing the past, she discusses it like it was a miracle of prayer, not science. I don't want to ask her why she's changing the facts of the past, but she's so convincing with her story that it's starting to make me wonder if I'm crazy. All of her friends go along with her story, too. Am I making too much of this? — Stickler for Facts

"There are so many great details (in vintage clothing) -- lining put in by hand, top-stitching and handmade buttonholes that would be very expensive to execute today," D'Angelo says. "Many of the pieces are one of a kind, and vintage fashion offers excellent value."
Baxter has long created her own accessories, so when she suggests making corsages out of ribbons and a beanie out of an old sweater, she's speaking from experience. As a teen, she sewed herself clothes she otherwise couldn't afford. In college, she began making hats. And as a foreign correspondent for the BBC, she was known as the journalist who took her sewing machine everywhere.
The public will be able to see not only how different eras of the American military celebrated Christmas, but also what enemy forces would do for the holiday. There will also be letters read from the wives of soldiers, said Carroll.
Yet on Tuesday, she left for school with a whole stack of "Vote for Kaitlyn" stickers she spent making the night before for a friend who was nominated instead.
According to NFL.com, Harnish is a quarterback from Northern Ilinois listed at 6-feet-2 and 219 pounds. He is said to have "the arm strength, frame and mentality to be a starting quarterback at the next level, but his accuracy is so off at times that it brings his value all the way down to the late rounds."
"Dreams," remarked Protestant reformer John Calvin, "are to be taken in a good sense, for God was wont to make himself known to his servants by dreams." ("Institutes of the Christian Religion," book I, chapter II, section 8, 108.) Or, as I'm prone to say, pay attention to polar bears on sleds or wives in freshly painted rooms. Not to mention printable fruit.
What did we do to deserve this? Don’t know, but this month features two meddlesome ladies cracking wise — Barbra Streisand, as an impossible momma in “My Mother’s Curse,” and Bette Midler as a pushy grandma in “Parental Guidance.” Eeyore himself couldn’t do such braying.
The barbecue soup was one of three daily specials (market price). Don't expect to find it again. My server, who's worked here for months, hadn't seen a special repeated. Noodlecat's Facebook page usually reveals them the night before.
Earlier this week, SANA reported that a pro-regime candidate, Abdul-Hamid al-Taha, was gunned down in the southern city of Daraa in an attack it blamed on "armed terrorists," the term the regime generally uses for opponents.
Donaldson said candidates were mostly from Oregon, Washington and California, but also added that the city received interest from applicants from other states including Arizona and Colorado. The selection of a permanent police chief later this spring will end an almost six-month process to replace late chief Dan Duncan, who died of a heart attack last May.
Since the attack, he and three friends also in the ROTC walk together to and from school. Sometimes they walk in a group in the street to avoid the abandoned houses on his block -- only four of the homes on his block are occupied, he says.
Mike Rozier got the call - a dubious pitch to the right - and Chris Rockins stuffed him for no gain. The Oilers settled for a 27-yard field goal by Zendejas.
We're generating revenue in two ways. First, on a fee-for-service basis, the way any consultant might generate revenue; and second, on an investment-return basis.

The wannabe sports Mecca is more like a ship of fools.
Then, as I read on, three of the commissioners -- there are four -- want to increase the chair's pay by 2 percent more because the chair takes on extra responsibilities. So the way I see it, the chair would receive a 3 1/2 percent increase and the commissioners a 1 1/2 percent increase, and that does not take into account the extra cost for benefits.
No fewer than 48 streets will be closed or partially closed along the path of the Carmel Marathon, which will span the city. Some streets will be blocked off for a few hours, others all day.
But the game turned again in the ninth when Getz, who grew up in nearby Grosse Pointe, delivered his game-winner.

Drivers traveling across the plains initially were warned to fuel up because gasoline wasn't available to be pumped in the area, but state transportation officials said fuel was available by Friday night.
But there was no other choice. The rest of Gonzalez's family had already fled Fidel Castro's communist regime, and the privileges she'd enjoyed as a gymnast on Cuba's national team had dwindled. It was getting painfully difficult to find the medicine needed to treat her son's asthma, to say nothing of the money it cost.
Along the way, the movie provides a detailed glimpse of Jaipur - the buses and bicycles, the livestock in the street, the zigzagging traffic. Visually arresting, but once again: Save for retirement; you don't want to live there. Mixed in with the old folks, the movie follows the story of the would-be innkeeper (Patel) and the girl he wants to marry (Tena Desae), and so the cycle of passion goes on and on.
Freet expanded those childrens' possibilities when her second-grade class was chosen for the SLSO's Adopt-A-School program during the 2011-2012 school year. Freet co-taught 16 weeks of specialized music curriculum alongside the SLSO's Dacy Gillespie and other staff and musicians, guiding them to create their own musical creation.
"Parking lots sometimes charge a fuel surcharge to recoup their fuel fees," a representative responded. "Access fee is a fee that the airport charges and the parking lot has to give that to them.

On Friday, opponents of the hunt asked Judge Stephen Skillman of the state Appellate Division to grant the permit for the Franklin site on Route 46, for an unlimited number of protestors, and to expand the permit for Whittingham from 25 protestors to an unlimited number. Skillman denied both requests late this morning.

Many Maryland citizens are morally opposed to same-sex marriage. There is real outrage aimed at Gov.Martin O'Malleyfor encouraging another legislative battle on this issue. I believe it is arrogant and dangerous to redefine God's eternal law. Doing so would usher in an era of depravity that no amount of lawmaking could ever correct.

"You're expected to score goals," Boyd said. "It's something you need to deal with. That's a challenge you put upon yourself."
"I think the whole thing is hogwash," he said. "Seriously, over the years with leaner vintages, I've considered adding a touch of red wine to my rose to pick up a little color, and the results are almost entirely negative. Above about 0.5 percent addition of red, you start picking up tannin and bitterness, which is not a good thing."
With that special deal come significant restrictions on public use  limited hours and absolutely no touching creeks, rivers and waterfalls within one mile of the reservoir, which itself is eight miles long. No other national park has such a rule.

Yee's payment for the June 3 fundraiser doesn't appear in his most recent campaign finance filings because he wasn't billed until July 18, Stearns said. The most recent campaign finance reporting period closed on June 30.
øPeople don't take concussions or injuries serious sometimes. Especially with how much has gone on in the past two years on concussion research, I think kids in high school, for example, don't take it serious enough. For me, I had to sit out six to eight months, with just no physical activity whatsoever. Some people may say that's tough or it's silly that it takes that long. But it's your life. You're going to play sports for however long your body can take it. But for the rest of my life - I want kids, I want to enjoy life - so I don't want to take the risk now of having a head injury affect me 10 years from now.
Their path, they say, required navigating city politics, working within federal guidelines and facing what sometimes felt like intimidation from a local development representative. The day after students and parents testified against the ICE plan, for example, renovation work on their school mysteriously stopped.

"I'm pretty good at hooking it," said Watson, perhaps the game's most imaginative at shaping shots. "And it ended up close to the hole."
In the Kluger case, Fishman may have wrangled his biggest headline-grabbing catch to date. Prosecutors say Garrett Bauer, a New York trader; Robinson, a Long Island mortgage broker; and Kluger, an attorney who allegedly got inside information about company mergers and acquisitions while on the job, started working together to reap millions of dollars in profits on insider trades back in 1994 — when Kluger was a young summer legal associate at the prestigious New York law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore.

The 7-foot-1 Przybilla doesn't figure to be an impact player, not with the wear-and-tear of 11 NBA seasons, which includes two surgeries in the last 15 months to repair a ruptured patella tendon in his right knee. But if he has maintained any of the traits he displayed during his six and a half seasons in Portland (2004-2011) he should offer three skills the Blazers have lacked while sputtering to an 18-16 record: rebounding, toughness and the ability to set a good screen.
She's helped in no small part by sound designer Christopher Kriz, who creates a sonic backdrop that's as elusive and as effective as a half-remembered nightmare. Also adding to the ambiance is Michael McNamara's lighting design, a marvel of dark shadows and encroaching twilight.

-- Nicolas Batum shows some touch using the glass on a baseline jumper for two points. New York will hold for the final shot of the quarter ... and, they will get a chance for two at the line with a whistle coming with one second left in the half. Amar'e Stoudemire at the line, and he splits the pair. Portland can't get a clean look on the final possession At the end of the first half, New York is leading Portland 56-50.
Or consider someone with a checking account in Canada, maybe because the person has a cottage there and uses that bank account to pay bills in the summer.
The officers ordered him to stop, but when they approached Butts he ran and slid under his bunk. When he refused to come out, officers shocked him with a Taser.

What will this volatility mean for next week's round of major contemporary-art sales? The catalogs are thick because sellers still feel confident in art values, but auctioneers will likely keep their fingers crossed because buyers remain choosy. Two lots to watch: Mark Rothko's "Orange, Red, Yellow" abstract, priced to sell Tuesday at Christie's for at least $35 million, and Roy Lichtenstein's "Sailboats III," which was also once owned by Mr. Forstmann and is priced to sell Wednesday at Sotheby's for $6 million or more.

Take a company like Foursquare: they want to be an interactive city guide. They want to be the app everyone who has a smartphone opens when they're trying to decide where to do and what to go in the city. If they accomplish that, can they make money? The conservative answer is probably, because a platform like that would be valuable to tons of local merchants and venues. But one thing is certain: if people stop using Foursquare, it's never going to make money. In other words, Foursquare's number one business problem is eyeballs, not revenue.

-- In many of the world's major cities, you can buy "city cards" that provide admissions to a laundry list of local attractions and facilities.

Laid-off workers may keep their money in their ex-employer's 401(k) plan or roll it over into an individual retirement account, or IRA, under government rules. Advisers say that, if the 401(k) is a good plan, with low expenses and solidly performing funds, you should consider standing pat to take advantage of the resources such plans offer, such as investment-ratings data and other information, said Jason Chepenik, managing partner of Chepenik Financial, an Orlando financial-planning firm. Older workers should definitely avoid rolling over 401(k) funds into an IRA, he said, because early withdrawals from an IRA are always subject to the 10 percent government penalty, even if the laid-off employee is age 55 to 59 1/2.

From the soft dough he's made mere hours earlier, he cuts off a few strips, stretches them to arm's length, and then, one at a time, tosses them like a cowboy ready to launch a lasso, spinning the noodle to give it pliancy, elasticity and bounce, tying off the rope with the dexterity of a Boy Scout. Next he plunges ribbon after ribbon into a pot of boiling water, fishes them out, and into a pan of sizzling oil they go. A flick of bright red pepper flakes -- whoosh! -- a drizzle of scarlet chile oil -- hiss! -- a cascade of ground pork -- splat!

The new law authorizes the creation of a tracking system. Under the new law, when problems occur, the source readily can be identified and all of the dangerous products can be recalled. Under the existing system, precious days and weeks could be lost while authorities tried to determine where questionable ingredients had been distributed. That was especially true when the tainted foods were sold to processors who used them to manufacture other foods sold to consumers.

The Red Bull Music Academy rolled into New York City Sunday, Sept. 25 and concluded on Sept. 30. The tour stop spotlighted pioneering works in hip-hop this go-round.

And while some would tell me I am in the "1 percent," I know that I am only in that rarefied air as long as I am working. I have no pension to speak of, having had it terminated by my employer. All I have is my savings — savings based on sacrifices made by me and my family over my lifetime. And it occurs to me that I sacrifice and save to ensure a secure financial future for me and my wife. And yes, I feel entitled to pass something down to my children.

As a licensed clinical social worker and having more than 20 years working in mental health and addictions, I can assure you that addiction does not discriminate!

Parque Nacional Volcán Nevado de Colima, is home to the snow-covered, sleeping Volcán Nevado de Colima, but it's the younger, tempestuous Volcán de Fuego that steals the show. The "volcano of fire" has lived up to its name with a vengeance, erupting more than 30 times since 1585 — and still fuming. The University of Colima Volcano Observatory has monitored its activity for 20 years, including a June 2005 explosion that shot ash 3 miles into the sky.

Aldridge shot zero on Monday. He had only two in Game 3. He has just 20 foul shots in five games this postseason against the Mavericks. I'm not blaming the officiating, I'm faulting the mentality. I know Aldridge has it in him to be aggressive, and work for his shot. He has great feet, soft hands, runs well and makes the game look easy.

Because people need to be able to train for new jobs and careers in today’s fast-changing economy, we are also revitalizing America’s community colleges. Last month, I saw the promise of these schools at Forsyth Tech in North Carolina. Many of the students there used to work in the surrounding factories that have since left town. One mother of two, a woman named Kathy Proctor, had worked in the furniture industry since she was 18 years old. And she told me she’s earning her degree in biotechnology now, at 55 years old, not just because the furniture jobs are gone, but because she wants to inspire her children to pursue their dreams too. As Kathy said, “I hope it tells them to never give up.”
-- I was so busy filing my story for the paper and running down to field level for the postgame locker room that I have no idea why LG Kevin Boothe was out of the game at the end. Stacy Andrews had come in to left tackle and David Diehl shifted back down to guard. Since Boothe seemed fine in the postgame locker room and no injury was announced, I'll assume it was a personnel decision. We'll see if it stays that way against Green Bay.

Sometimes with Reed, it’s just a matter of timing. He can be revealing and charming to the media one day and uninterested and dismissive the next. He’ll heap praise on teammates and opponents one moment, then openly criticize his quarterback shortly thereafter. Heck, he interrupted one post-game interview this season to playfully chastise reporters for not asking him about golfer Fred Couples and his President Cup-winning U.S. team.
However, a close friend of Andrea Sneiderman’s, along with her father-in-law, testified that she notified them that Rusty had been shot before she arrived at Atlanta Medical Center.

SS/2B Ryan Theriot. Today: Plus-2 at 2B. Two Runs Saved at 2B (rank not available). Theriot was a minus-20 at shortstop at the break and his minus-15 runs saved ranked 35th at his position in the majors. Since the arrival of Furcal, Theriot has seen more time at second, and he's been a plus defender there, holding steady this month at plus-2.
Still, given the criticism of Lugar from within his own party, Mourdock might be the perfect challenger: He is a strict conservative, rejecting even the slightest ideological middle ground. Unlike Lugar, he has spent years cultivating local Republican Party insiders from Lake Michigan to the Ohio River. And he is not well-known among the broader public, so if this is a referendum on Lugar, Mourdock could be seen as a safe "anyone but him" candidate.

Gardner has been one of the state's top players since her freshman season, earning All-5A first-team honors the last three years. She led Gilbert in kills in her first two seasons, 421 as a freshman (earning All-5A second team honors) and 590 as a sophomore, then had 251in an injury-plagued junior season. And though she had 407 kills this season, there was still some debate as to who was the state's top player.

Briefly: The last time the Pilots won a game in San Diego was during the 2003-04 season. Since then, they've dropped five consecutive games to the Toreros and lost another one to Pepperdine in overtime at the 2008 WCC Tournament. ... Last season, Matt Dorr scored 17 points to lead four San Diego players in double figures, lifting the Toreros to a 66-60 victory in San Diego and a split of the two-game season series. ... San Diego is coming off an 87-71 loss at San Francisco Sunday. Leading scorers Brandon Johnson and De'Jon Jackson were held out of the starting lineup for disciplinary reasons, but came off the bench and combined for 45 points on 14 of 29 shooting from the field. ... The Toreros, in their third season under Bill Grier, the former Gonzaga assistant, return two starters from last season's team that finished 16-16 and lost to Santa Clara in the quarterfinals of the WCC Tournament in Las Vegas.

No matter what you decide to do -- or not to do Valentine's Day, make reservations as quickly as possible if it involves a restaurant. You could start out with dinner at Lake Chalet, which sits on Lake Merritt and has beautiful views but the food is not spectacular. But you should at least have a drink there and rent a gondola that departs from the dock. There is a little subterranean store decorated to seem like a shop in Venice. If it's not warm outside, sit in the back lounge area of Lake Chalet where there is a fireplace and better service.
“They did dominate us,’’ Horton said. “They outplayed us every which way they could outplay us last time.’’

The all-purpose threat Thomas poses figures to grow in the coming weeks because of two twists and turns that took place Thursday.

Nonetheless, some defensive polluters and politicized critics are hauling out the myth that we must choose between job creation and economic growth. Let's look at the facts.
A couple of years ago, Laurenzi, a John Carroll University graduate, teamed up with NeoMed Inc., an Atlanta-area company run by a college classmate, to create the SafeBaby Breast Milk Tracking System. The system, which manages the storage, identification and feeding of expressed breast milk for premature and critically ill babies, is used at UH's Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital and two other hospitals in the country, Laurenzi said.
Thoughts of a potential no-hitter seemed to spread shortly after the fifth inning. Cameras showed the pitcher sequestered alone in the dugout near the orange Gatorade tubs, patting the back of his own neck. Niese, though, insisted he talked to all his teammates as he would any other day. Collins and pitching coach Dan Warthen set a 115-pitch limit they would not stray from, even though Niese claimed he would dart out and take the mound anyway.

On one level, "Gossamer" is a fantasy tale. The aforementioned young girl isn't a human, but rather a dream giver, part of a community of tiny creatures (their relative size indicated by a brief, initial appearance in puppet form before the actors take over) who shepherd the nightly memories of humans. She's learning the tricks of the trade, gathering fragments of a person's past from the surface of the possessions in a home, and combining them into comforting, restorative dreams, bestowed through the ears in a spray of magic sparkles. She's also being taught the dangers of "delving," touching objects too deeply and becoming attached to them or their owners: That way lies the dark side for her kind, banishment from the collective "Heap" and transformation into one of the nightmare-inflicting Sinisteeds. While adults can ponder the Buddhist and Jungian implications of all this, fifth-grader Winter Wagner makes the dream giver Littlest One a charmingly precocious focal point for the school-age audience.

"I grew up with an Aja from the Steely Dan album, a Rhiannon, from the Stevie Nicks song, and I knew an Alison who was named after that Elvis Costello song, so I think it's really out there in the culture," says Eby, 26, a freelance writer. "When you're thinking about names for your child, you want to name them after something that sounds beautiful, or something you love, and a pop song can be both of those."

That mix of a period setting with a more modern flair gave the production leeway in some areas — Gyllenhaal's costumes are cheated forward just a bit style-wise — while also causing them careful concern in others. A day's shooting was paused for a conference as to whether it was appropriate for a man and woman to shake hands when meeting at a dinner party.

"For us, it's a chance in a very positive way to have an active collaboration with many people who are regular members of our audience, to have a chance to make music with them, not just play for them," he said.

That changed when a pastor who introduced Perry to cultural conservatives called Mormonism a "cult" and said Romney is "not a Christian," forcing Perry to distance himself and Romney to respond. The back-and-forth suggests the primary race - with a field finally settled and just three months before voting begins - has moved into a more aggressive phase. And it illustrates that Perry's very public religiosity and long history with evangelical Christian leaders won't remain on the sidelines of the presidential race.

The New Power Generation rhythm section gave the pop star the foundation he needed for lengthy, dexterous six-string solos on "Cream," "Purple Rain," and many other songs in the set. Prince is never mentioned during those endless debates about the best guitarists in rock history, and that's probably because he's better known for his songwriting. But he deserves consideration. In the '80s, he took many of the clichés of hard rock guitar, set them slightly askew, and incorporated them into his pop productions. Decades later, he's still evolving, drawing from experimental music and outre jazz.

ISTANBUL, Turkey — The Turks have a blockbuster on their hands. It's called "Fetih 1453," as in the year the Turks conquered the Byzantine capital of Constantinople — now the sprawling city of Istanbul.

In Europe, a threat resurfaced that Italy's government could lose control of the country's debt crisis.

When my RAND colleagues and I tried to project the consequences if California passed a 2010 marijuana-legalization ballot initiative, we started by calculating the cost of producing marijuana in residential grow-houses, a likely production venue if the drug were legalized at the state level. We calculated that the pretax price for high-potency, indoor-grown marijuana could drop by more than 80%. If national legalization allowed producers to switch to greenhouses and outdoor farming, the prices would drop even further: A "joint" might cost pennies rather than dollars.

Not only is the bill premature, it also would seem to be triggered by almost any local regulation affecting oil and gas extraction. An amendment discussed this week would limit the ban on severance revenue to jurisdictions imposing a drilling moratorium, which is somewhat more reasonable. Still, most of the moratoriums enacted thus far have been quite limited in duration. Only Boulder County has pushed the envelope with a moratorium that will last until February of next year.
