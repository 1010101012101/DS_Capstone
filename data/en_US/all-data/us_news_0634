The children, who closed the afternoon set, stole the show, demonstrating as much fervor as any of the adults, and skillfully whipping the crowd into a frenzy. Though the event's schedule was tight, organizers let them keep going beyond their allotted time.

"Pro-anas" (anorexics) and "pro-mias" (bulimics) sometimes combine aspirational visuals -- ranging from shockingly skeletal close-ups of rib cages to full-length portraits of thin, beautiful celebrities such as model Kate Moss -- with tips on hiding self-starvation from parents and suggestions on the bare minimum you can eat to stay alive. In the twisted world of pro-ana and pro-mia motivation, misery loves company, and the secretive, isolated ED sufferer feels the pull of community.

As a member of St. Cronan's parish for the past 25 years, I have witnessed the assignment of a pedophilic priest as its pastor, by former Archbishop Rigali (the priest's string of charges were hidden from public disclosure by the Chancery). Parents (including myself) had not been informed of the risks facing their children. Coincidentally, shortly after the news broke of the local pedophilia scandal, Archbishop Rigali was promoted to Cardinal of Philadelphia. He left St. Louis without even a simple apology to the people of St. Cronan's.

After centuries of shipping vast amounts of bubbly across the English Channel, the British finally acknowledged that the same block of Kimmeridgian limestone under Champagne also covers a good chunk of southern Britain. Fledgling vineyards have cropped up across the South Downs, south of London, with a helping boost from global warming, the most famous being Nyetimber (actually founded by two Americans), plus Chapel Down and Ridgeview. Wine expert Steven Spurrier was even planning a vineyard on his Dorset property. The reward of tasting English bubbly is matched by the challenge of finding it.

And that response is strong enough that they can read a column about the finite ability of government to defend lives and property, and the need for Americans to consider how they might fill in the gaps when necessary, and interpret it as a flight of dark fancy about how Americans must arm themselves so they can overthrow the government someday.

Fresno City Councilman Henry T. Perea— who, it is interesting to note, is the son of a member of the Board of Supervisors — was elected to the state Assembly in 2010 and asked state Auditor Elaine M. Howle to probe county response to reports of child abuse. He initially wanted all counties to be included, but that would be too long and too expensive a task for the audits bureau, so he limited the request to his county and the biggest counties in three different sections of the state.

A simple Google search for Retriever Towing pulls up a surprising number of results that bring into question both the ethics and integrity of the company and Mr. Coe. Combined with his dismissive response to a story reported by KOIN-TV (6) of Portland resident Ashley Holmquist's legally parked car being towed on Christmas with no refund provided by Retriever Towing, it's difficult to take his candidacy seriously. If he's not willing to be upfront about his dealings in the private sector, why should we as voters expect anything different from him if he were an elected official?

I have to take issue with the assertion in today's editorial ("We need an election" Aug. 2) that the battle we saw over the debt ceiling increase on Capitol Hill is an illustration of how dysfunctional Washington is.

Foreclosures and evictions are virtually nonexistent in the West Bank because cultural pressure makes it difficult for lenders to repossess property in the close-knit Palestinian society. Large extended families support one another in times of financial need and lenders would be criticized for tossing borrowers out on the street, particularly if the default was caused by unpaid salaries during a Palestinian Authority crisis.

In suburban Chicago, Ruth Spiro handled it this way when she once tried to fudge the age of her now 13-year-old daughter for the price of a kid ticket at the movies: "I said something like, 'If we had come to see this movie two weeks ago, it would have cost X, but since we're coming after your birthday, it's going to cost Y. Let's pretend it's still before your birthday, because it doesn't seem fair that we have to pay more.'"
The nine-member council didn't vote on the agreement today because many members are still undecided.

Asked recently whether teachers unions were getting in the way of progress, the president said: "I'm a strong supporter of the notion that a union can protect its members and help be part of the solution as opposed to part of the problem.

What sounds, what images, what messages, I wonder, might my kids hear or see today that will stick in their heads? Will it be that commercial for the giant cupcake cake pan?

Or maybe a video game image of a gruesome dismemberment?

There were rattlesnakes and bobcats, bighorn sheep and who knows what else. But not a lot of company. The nearest town, Joshua Tree, was 18 miles away; Twentynine Palms was even farther. A trip to the market took six days round-trip by freight wagon. They didnt make the trip often.

Under the bill, the Vikings would sign a 30-year lease on a stadium to be built on the site of the Metrodome in Minneapolis. The team would pay about $13 million annually in operating fees, though a public authority gets the power to rent out the building on non-game days for concerts, conventions and special events.

Two slyly interlocking one-acts pop together like puzzle pieces in Linda McLean's elusive new drama. This enigmatic portrait of existence captures the way people slog from one day to the next, barely noticing precious hours slipping by. It's only in the big moments, when something terrible, or something wonderful, happens that we look at who we are with anything like clarity. That's the kind of day that unfolds in this affecting postmodern tragicomedy, cleverly directed by Jon Tracy in its American premiere at San Francisco's Magic Theatre.

June 1944. Joe Sheehan arrives back in Portland for good. A few months later he marries a woman he met on the train coming west and adopts her two children, Patrick, 6, and Henrietta, 14. He and his brothers, who are now back in Portland as well, attempt to open a billiard room. The new venture never takes off because the local billiards market is already saturated. (At the time, according to the younger Sheehan, there were more than 700 pool tables in downtown Portland alone. "All of the big hotels had at least one as did the nicer smoke shops and the barber shops," he says. There were also numerous pool halls with names like the Elite and the Alaskan.)

The measure (A-3393) was introduced last week amid great fanfare.

Rally-goers, with bottles of iced tea and bags of Skittles -- the snacks Martin was out getting when he was shot -- chanted for two hours as part of a nationwide trend of rallies in honor of Martin.

The question perplexing many residents of this town best known as the boyhood home of President Ronald Reagan: How could that much money go undetected by city leaders? Some residents plan to hold a rally at city offices Friday to demand answers.
Like many of the best French genre moviemakers since the '60s, though, Richet knows American film style inside out. He also obviously knows Carpenter's original movie: that brilliant, low-budget, no-star indie about cops and convicts trapped in an L.A. precinct station about to close down, forced to form unlikely alliances to fight off the bloodthirsty street gang surrounding them.

Happy Dog, 5801 Detroit Ave., Cleveland, 216-651-9474: Yes, only four things are on the menu -- giant quarter-pound hot dogs, vegan sausage, fries and tots -- but it might be the most limitless in the city. Add as many as 50 -- yes, fifty -- toppings to your frankfurter, from Creole remoulade to Cheez Whiz to chunky peanut butter. More often than not, the combinations dazzle. The tots are delicious, and you can wash it all down with one -- or more -- of about two dozen drafts.

It's very rare these days for an NFL team to run the ball more often than it passes over the course of a season. But new coach Jeff Fisher's teams did so eight times in 16 seasons in Tennessee and Houston. Usually it was Fisher's worst teams that passed the ball more. In fact, all five of Fisher's losing teams over those 16 seasons threw the ball more often than they ran it.

Square 13 of our 49 Mile food tour takes us out to the Embarcadero and the waterfront stretch bounded by the Ferry Plaza and AT&T Park.
But there's a reason for the severe nitpicking in Dallas. The 11 consecutive 50-win seasons is the most by any NBA team that has not won a title in that stretch. The two teams tied for No. 1 with 12 50-win seasons won multiple championships, with the Lakers ('79-80 to '90-91) winning five, and Spurs ('99-00 to this season) getting three and really deserving an asterisk because they went 37-13 and won a championship in the lockout-shortened '98-99 season, and also won 56 games the season before.
By June 30, Joe's stores are expected to be picked over, cleaned out and locked up.

Like the rest of the domestic wine industry, Oregon has contended with a 20-year period when the biggest, flashiest, most powerful wines were frequently given the highest scores or the most attention in the press. In the Willamette Valley such efforts seemed forced, and those who pursued the style were often thought of, somewhat unflatteringly, as "Californian."
It is difficult to get the hellhounds to pay attention to the television. Lucy will at least give it a look. Her all-time favorite show was "The Wire." That was about drug dealing in Baltimore. Often there were dogs barking in the background. She'd bark back. Then the hellhounds would bark, but they were just barking because their leader was barking. I doubt they could tell "The Wire" from "The Jeffersons."
Ablin saw an irony in the reaction to the ISM report. Europe’s debt crisis has knocked markets around for months, jerking stocks down on worries its troubles could cross the Atlantic. But Europe’s woes have made U.S. manufacturers look more attractive to companies, Ablin said.

In fact, Monsanto said that its long-standing practice of licensing genetic traits to competitors, including DuPont, has benefited farmers, not hurt them, and that competition in the seed business is robust.
It's impossible to overstate Chacin's importance to the rotation. He has top-shelf talent, so if he pitches like a fifth starter, the other pieces won't fit. Chacin never exceeded 91 mph with his fastball, and it didn't have the late life he needs to be successful. He issued five walks, including four in the third inning when the crowd turned on him.

Government policy keeps trying to promote the revolution -- with an unconstitutional vengeance, lately -- and to what result? The traditional, urban, black family is receding into distant memory. Among Hispanics, out-of-wedlock births are way up. And among women of all races under 30, more than half of births are to singles.
But those investigations systematically excluded or dismissed the majority of complaints by owners that their Toyota and Lexus vehicles had suddenly accelerated, which sharply narrowed the scope of the probes, the Times investigation revealed.
Kentucky won the game even with star center Anthony Davis hitting just 1 of 10 shot because he affected the game in so many other ways (16 rebounds, six blocks, five assists). The Wildcats won while hitting just 26.9 percent of its shots in the second half because, when Kansas rallied to cut a 18-point lead to five, the young stars kept their composure.

Lester is found in 17 counties in Minnesota and almost nowhere else. The Minnesota Association of Professional Soil Scientists was impressed enough with the dirt to choose it as the state's unofficial soil back in 1987.

"My putting was good," Icher said. "At the beginning, the greens were hard to read and slow, too. I had many opportunities at the beginning and I just made one birdie on No. 2 and then par, par, par, par. I was close to the hole, but then I made birdies on eight and nine. It was a good round, a good sensation. I love that course. It's just flat and enjoyable, so it was cool."

Franklin Central's Gabrielle Snyder hit a solo home run in the second to make it 10-5 and the Flashes (9-3) looked to make another run in the third. Franklin Central's Shannon Farr scored with two outs on an error, but the Flashes made the third out when the runner was caught in a rundown between first and second. It was the second time a Flashes runner had been caught up between the bases. The first came in the first inning and cost Franklin Central a run.

With the U.S. having squandered an estimated $3 trillion on the misbegotten war in Iraq, Romney, Gingrich and Perry denounce Obama for removing U.S. troops (at the insistence of the elected government of Iraq). And all three promise war with Iran to keep that nation from acquiring a nuclear weapon. Romney and Perry call for increasing the military budget, which would require deeper cuts of basic domestic investments.

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that suspects must explicitly tell police they want to be silent to invoke Miranda protections during criminal interrogations, a decision one dissenting justice said turns defendants' rights "upside down."
At the same time, the 17 players — in addition to other players, such as Antrel Rolle and Deon Grant, who have made Super Bowl runs on other teams — know what it takes in the postseason.

She says she's planning to make the 90-mile trip to Quail Hollow in Charlotte this weekend for the final round of the Wells Fargo Championship — though it's questionable whether her uncle will be around.

The Buffett Rule redistributes deck chairs on the Titanic, ostensibly to make more available for those in steerage. Nice idea, but the iceberg cometh. The enterprise is an exercise in misdirection - a distraction not just from Obama's dismal record on growth and unemployment but, more importantly, from his dereliction of duty in failing to this day to address the utterly predictable and devastating debt crisis ahead.
Daniel Lofgren, a retired State Patrol accident investigator, said that, based on the location of Phanthavong's injuries and the height of the damaged portions of Senser's vehicle, Phanthavong was likely bent over as he tried to put gas in his car.

It's not routine for a superstar to flip-flop about his trade demand right up until the 11th hour of the trade deadline. It's not routine for a superstar to try to get the coach fired and then the coach telling the media the dirty details.

øAnother wrinkle for taxpayers who converted in 2010 is the expiration of the 2001 Bush tax cuts at the end of this year. Depending on a number of factors, including who wins the presidential election, some high-income taxpayers could end up paying higher taxes on the second portion of their 2010 conversion. Paying taxes on the entire conversion this year would protect you from that prospect, but it's not an option, Bruno says. If you elected to defer income on a 2010 Roth conversion, you're locked into a 50-50 split, she says.

SLU has scored less than 60 points in three of its past five games, and won two of them. (Dayton 58-50, La Salle 59-51.) That doesn't happen very often.

With Ron Bartell coming off a neck injury and Bradley Fletcher rehabbing from knee surgery, the Rams could be in the market for help at cornerback. And given coach Jeff Fisher's past association with Titans cornerback Cortland Finnegan in Tennessee, it's easy enough to connect the dots.

The American immigration system is broken, and it's costing us dearly. It's holding us back from economic recovery and hurting businesses that are already struggling to survive. Despite the recession and our state's high unemployment rate, many Oregon employers still do not have an adequate supply of workers to fill their labor needs. The lack of available workers in many of our state's key industries means missed economic opportunities and a prolonged recession. The fact is that thousands of Oregon businesses depend on immigrant labor, and the system is not delivering the labor force that these businesses need to succeed.

And judging by the trailer that's where it's headed. But one of the most appealing aspects of the original was that it was relatively simple, at least for science fiction. It left a lot to the viewer's imagination, which was appropriate for a mind-bending movie born from a short story.
As the new year gets under way, here are some quick musings on what I saw on Broadway during my 2011 vacations there. First up, two shows about aging: an emotional "Follies" and a comical "Master Class."
The Gators were making their first appearance in the tournament since 2009 but had three senior starters plus George, a 6-foot junior. They remained calm at the end after the Buckeyes cut the lead to two.
Being a teen comes with its own set of challenges. While it's a wonderful time of personal growth and discovery, it's also when adolescents are testing the waters of dating and driving, exposure to smoking, alcohol and drugs, and peer pressure to grow up too fast. Throw diabetes into the mix and you've got a cocktail of angst like no other. While teens with diabetes face the same choices as their peers, having diabetes complicates those choices.
The nonprofit Pujols Family Foundation hosts an annual prom, fishing trips and other events for area children and adults with the developmental disability.

A lot goes into the making of one, for sure, be it a book, a record, a movie or any other form of pop culture: talent, hard work, savvy marketing and, for better or worse, luck. Books and movies about a dystopian near future in which young people -- and children! -- fight to the death in a glorified reality show at the behest of a totalitarian government? That's kind of a tough sell, in theory. It's not Dr. Seuss, certainly.

Green grew so adept at discerning what his teammates needed on any given night that he earned himself conference player of the year and made several first-team All-America lists.

Masood Ahmed, the IMF's director for the Middle East and central Asia, said the plan will need to address Egypt's fiscal and economic imbalances, generate investor confidence and deal with social issues, as well as receiving support from Egypt's parliament and political leadership.
“At the property driveway, there were piles of mixed solid waste that appeared to be excavated recently. A bulldozer, a small excavator with grapple attachment and dump truck were located at the property.
Q: For two years we kept hearing about all the intangibles that Joel Anthony brings and that his true measure doesn't show up in the box score. Ronny Turiaf is an upgrade offensively but doesn't Joel provide a little better defense? Or were people just rationalizing Joel's true value to the team these past two years? -- Jeffrey.

He was based at New River Air Station in North Carolina.
Mistretta is eminently watchable in a role that successfully mixes the lust for power and ambition with a considerable degree of pathos. Using two forearm crutches and, later, a wheelchair to depict Grahame, who was stricken with polio as a child, Mistretta scores in both departments: We admire Grahame's ruthless skills, and our hearts sink each time his tortured body wavers.
When I told the nice film buyer from Britain sitting beside me at Sundance that Benh Zeitlin's bewitchingly moving debut feature set in an isolated Louisiana bayou was my favorite movie at the fest, he whispered "Oh, that's such a critic's film." I'm betting (praying even) he's mistaken. This gorgeously wrought tale of 6-year-old Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis) and father Wink (Dwight Henry) exerts the power of a modern-day, yet timeless, American myth. (June, PG-13)

Student Trevor Lucken, 26, said his goal is to someday appear on "Dancing With The Stars."
The legendary dancer stars as a haughty former general of the White Russian army who falls for a poor young waitress (played by Anna Sinyakina) and grasps for one last shot at happiness as time slips away. The role reminds the ballet star of his father, who was a military man and a stern, foreboding figure.
We visited a vast 22,000 acre training base in East Kabul, where thousands of new Afghan recruits begin their military instruction with classes in basic literacy and numeracy (some cannot even count the number of rounds of ammunition being issued to them). Since President Obama's speech one year ago at West Point announcing a surge of American troops, the number of volunteer recruits has climbed, and thousands of trained Afghan soldiers are being added to the army every day. However, the strength of the force is sapped by a persistently high attrition rate. The question is how quickly and at what level of sustainability the Afghan forces can be trained and deployed to provide security and stability for their own country.

Maybe Miller was in New York interviewing former Knicks president Donnie Walsh, with a second stop in Philadelphia to meet with Larry Brown, who wants to get back into the NBA. I don't know.

As a matter of fact, if voters really believed Strickland's administration had done enough to create or keep jobs in Ohio, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher would today be U.S. senator-elect, not a 2011 cameo in someone's "whatever happened to" feature.
I'd previously been a big fan of Johnson's roasted chicken, but if he'd been using a bed of hay as a moisturizer and flavorizer in early versions, I don't think he was touting it. The hay-roasted hen ($16) arrived atop a potato pancake and roasted leeks and carrots that were arranged into an abstract flower. It was a basic Sunday-supper comfort food, but so much better, with the more-resistant texture and fuller flavor of a free-range bird and an ideal level of moistness.
But we paid him for nearly two years after it had became clear that the federal government considered him a thief and racketeer.
Earlier versions of the DREAM Act would treat these kids as potential citizens  the best course. If they arrived in the United States before age 16, had been in the country for five years, graduated from a U.S. high school and had no criminal record, they would get conditional legal status. They could get a green card within six years if they went to college or joined the U.S. military.
"This case is not the equivalent of some fool who went to a bar and tied one on," Iaciofano said during a hearing on the case on Jan. 27 in Superior Court in Morristown.

It took three years, two progress prizes worth $50,000, and thousands of hours of research. The competition came down to a nail-biting finale in 2009, after one team with New Jersey ties told Netflix they had reached the 10 percent requirement.
“That’s not the story of this game,” Collins said. “The story of the game is that R.A. Dickey was outstanding. He had the knuckler working and he was really pitching great. I wanted to keep him out there, but once the rain came it made no sense to leave him in there.”
The initial investigation phase is fairly straightforward, but it requires workers and supervisors to make critical decisions, often in a matter of minutes when the call first comes in and sometimes without key pieces of information, such as interviews with the family.

Taxpayers vent their rage in school elections because they don’t get to vote on much else that directly affects their taxes, said Bruce Baker, an associate professor at Rutgers University’s Graduate School of Education. Voters can voice their opinions on school budgets, but not on municipal, state or federal budgets.
The group's nine-member board of directors, which Ackerman put together, retains the right to vet and even veto the candidates, though a majority of the online membership can reverse that veto. But are candidates with more of a following than Roemer willing to come forward? There's been some speculation that Maine RepublicanSen.

The law says veiled women risk a $215 (euro150) fine or attendance at special citizenship classes, though not jail. People who force women to don a veil are subject to up to a year in prison and a $43,000 (euro30,000) fine, and possibly twice that if the veiled person is a minor. The ban affects women who wear the niqab and the burqa.

What? How can this be? According to Stein, no one is allowed to doubt Darwinism, and yet scientific conferences, papers and books are full of challenges to the theory, all of which are taught in biology classes. What gives? Creationism, that's what. Despite the best efforts of the proponents of intelligent design to present their theory as pure science having nothing to do with religion, Stein has unwittingly debunked that myth in a film with a central thesis that intelligent design is a religious doctrine and that is why it is not taught. Because of that pesky establishment clause in the 1st Amendment to the Constitution, religion has been systematically expelled from classrooms to culture. Has it?
He was so good to me. He always treated me as an equal, though I'll never be one. He was such an iconic figure in this town. Everyone knew that except Herb. He never looked on himself that way.

America's biggest export is trash — the scrap paper and metal we throw away. The Chinese buy it, make products out of it, sell them back to us at enormous profit, and we turn it into trash again. America, the country that once made things for the world, is nowChina'strash compactor.
One Democrat after another took the floor to condemn the bill, saying it curtailed the right to collectively bargain, drawing applause and cheers from the gallery.
Now, there are caveats: If gasoline tax revenue comes in lower than expected, there may not be enough to invest to in mass transit projects, which also serve the bay. If drivers seeking fuel efficiency switch to electric cars, that may not help much either. Electricity comes mostly from coal, which adds mightily to air and water pollution.
"In a complex world, when so many things are fluid, having roots, having constancy, is important," Coburn said.
School boards in every other Somerset County district voted earlier this year to move school elections to November and avoid a levy vote -- so long as the year-over-year increase in the levy remains under a cap mandated by the Legislature. This year that cap is 2%.

"Microsoft's step into tablet technology might attract users who don't want to choose between productivity software and entertainment," according to the survey.

The Bears were clearly the better team while defeating the Seahawks 35-24 in Sunday's divisional playoff game. Even though Green Bay has lost six starters to injury this season, that won't necessarily be the case when the Bears host the Packers in the first postseason meeting between these storied rivals since 1941.
