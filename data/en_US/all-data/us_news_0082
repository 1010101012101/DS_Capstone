A scavenger-hunt sketch seems a sequel to season 1's adult hide-and-seek league, but it falls flat, since the comedy only comes from Fred being a short guy, who speaks in a weird, high voice and repeats, at least once too often, that he's a little guy.

The public hearings arguably were nothing more than stagecraft meant to build a legal "record" -- to candy-coat this nauseating mummery.

I think LaMichael will be a great fit for the 49ers. He gets to play behind a veteran running back in Frank Gore who he can learn from, and both backs have such contrasting styles (Gore is a big bruising back, James is quick and speedy) that they will provide balance for the team. And LaMichael gets to play for a great coach in Jim Harbaugh, who will find a way to get him involved if LaMichael works hard.

On the first visit, the cashier offered to bring the meal in courses, and that paid off in a good meal.

On the drive home from the airport Beth notices a dog on the side of the freeway. A few animal crackers and a bath later, the family has a new pooch, and Grace has a new romance, Freeway's very attentive vet Sam (Jay Ali). This is accompanied by lots of slice of life quick cuts, all of them featuring Freeway. This dog is given so much soft-focus adoration by the filmmaker and cinematographer Michael McDonough ("Winter's Bone") that even dog lovers will start to get restless. It is also a clue to just how thin the story to come is.

Then there's another giant market distortion. With Prop. 13 limiting their ability to tap property taxes, local governments since 1978 have sought sales-tax generating businesses.

Credit card CDW works only if you (1) charge the entire rental to the card and (2) make sure you decline the rental company's CDW. That can be harder than it sounds: Some companies issue contracts with the insurance box pre-marked as "accept" and you have to enter your decline specifically. Also -- and I'm indebted to Bob Bestor, publisher of the excellent "Gemutlichkeit" online travel newsletter (www.gemut.com) for this one -- make sure you don't inadvertently pay cash for some minor extra such as a ski rack, GPS system, or license sticker: That extra payment voids the "entire rental" requirement.

The United States seems to have two plans to deal with what is fast becoming a civil war in Syria. Plan A calls for the full implementation of the U.N. cease-fire and the complete cooperation of Bashar al-Assad, a dictator who would, at the risk of his very life, give up some power to the opposition. Plan B, on the other hand, envisions a military response through air power. For that to be implemented, Plan A must fail and more Syrians must die.

At 6:15 on a Monday evening, every table at Chapeau was filled and Philippe Gardelle, always a crowd favorite, was running around like the grand host he is. A chef by trade, he pops back and forth between the kitchen and the dining room. The space, which once housed the four-star Alain Rondelli, is snug, yet comfortable and elegant, with each table adorned with a small bouquet of flowers. This is one of the few places to get classic French preparations such as escargot in garlic herb butter; cassoulet; and chicken stuffed with veal. A la carte pricing is available, but most people opt for the fixed-price menus with loads of options.

The more finely chopped the onions and jicama, the better the relish. Aim for 1/8-inch dice.

Use graduated heat zones when you're grilling a variety of food requiring different levels of heat and cooking times. Pile the coals in an incline, with a thicker layer toward one side to create a hot zone for searing and then a thinner, more disperse area of coals at the other side for a low heat or holding zone. Chicken parts are also best grilled this way, because it allows you to sear skin to a crisp, cook the meat through all the way to the bone and adjust for the variances of dark and white meat. Graduated zones can be combined with indirect cooking -- you'll have three different temperature areas for much more control over your food.

Now the Pleasure Chest is organizing "Fifty Shades of Pleasure" workshops at its West Hollywood, Chicago and New York locations.
Past generations saw college as the key to living the American dream. The good life. As in, if you go to college and get a degree, suddenly doors that you never knew existed will open up for you. You would almost automatically find a decent-paying job that would never be lost in a round of layoffs. You'd earn enough to support yourself and a family, and maybe buy a house with a white picket fence. And you'd retire with enough money to do a bit of traveling and still pay for all your ailments in old age.

Everything in this part of town seems to speak of Neapolitan kings. Most of them were foreigners who gained the throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies (encompassing southern Italy and the island of Sicily) by conquest, treaty or war and then had to face the even greater challenge of ruling rambunctious Naples. Nevertheless, the city developed a fondness for its kings, voting 10 to 1 in favor of retaining the monarchy during the popular referendum of 1946 when the rest of Italy chose to become a republic.

Still, the fledgling company faces huge challenges, aside from an ailing beer market. Scaling up to a national level often stretches resources too thin and dilutes a brand.

The report found that managers’ emphasis on referrals created a perception among BDOs that there was a quota system in place, and that promotions depended on their producing high numbers. The report said one of the managers, George Schultz, instructed officers to manipulate a point system used to assess whether a passenger’s behavior merits referral to law enforcement officers, or LEOs. The report said the practice was so widespread that transportation security officers, or TSOs, and supervisory TSOs, who are not involved in behavior detection, eventually confronted behavior detection managers Robert Hakius and Joseog Yurechko about it.

S is raising four daughters alone. The oldest is 22 and has profound mental retardation and physical disabilities. Until a few months ago, S was working part time and taking classes at a community college. Then she fell down a flight of stairs and broke her leg.

Whenever I hear of cases like this, of psychics working with police or family members solve a missing person case, I secretly hope there's something to it. It's not that I hold much stock in the paranormal — I have enough trouble figuring out the actual normal let alone whatever it is that goes on in astral pathways or Area 51 or all those blocked chakras.

If some union rule or HR regulation has allowed her to keep her job, then the law needs to be changed so that the next time a teacher bullies a child, especially one with special needs, they will be immediately fired.

As much as team officials say that they feel that either Anthony Allen and Damien Berry is capable of stepping into a more meaningful role backing up Ray Rice, I’d still be somewhat surprised if the Ravens didn’t draft a running back at some point. Cincinnati’s Isaiah Pead may be off the board before the Ravens are on the clock in the third round, but guys like Temple’s Bernard Pierce or Washington’s Chris Polk could be available there. The reality is there is a good chance that we won’t be seeing much of Rice through the various camps as he tries to get a contract extension, so the Ravens need to add much more depth at running back.

Squeezed between a laundromat and a nail salon in a strip mall, the tight restaurant is decorated with pre-Colombian-like ceramics, posters of Peruvian landmarks and textiles that serve as tablecloths — but its most interesting cultural contribution is the live music played weekly.

Touring the narrow winding roads of St. Barths in my Mini was a fun way to experience the simple elegance of the island as the stylish subdivisions quickly transitioned to dirt roads and secluded beaches. I picnicked with a baguette, wine and cheese at the public Gouverneur Beach on a long stretch of undeveloped sandy waterfront, under the watchful eyes of both a Russian oligarch's multimillion-dollar estate, and some wild goats.
