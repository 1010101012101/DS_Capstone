Overall, I found the book an interested read, and I would read the next two in the series if I found them for little to no money. For anyone who’s ever been at all interested in alternative lifestyles, this one might be a decent read. For someone looking for serious literature, though, I would look elsewhere.

As strange as this sounds, I’m kind of sad our trainings are over. There is something so comforting about being in a room full of people that are at the same place as you in life. There were probably about 30 others there besides us and just knowing that we are all about to embark on this same journey together brought me much hope. It’s kind of a feeling of…if they can do it…I can do it.

My children, I hope, will not suffer the same, I will not override their choices no matter how bad I may deem them to be. I will not live my dreams through them. I will allow them to follow their own paths, to make their own mistakes without criticism or condemnation, to allow them to fail and to be there to pick up the pieces. I have learned through my own experience and that of my parents that we cannot live anyone’s life for them, we cannot dictate who or what they will become, that is their choice, and I am grateful that society now allows my children to have that choice.
That number is smaller, by about $200 million, from the projections made by the developer's own consultant, sports economist Andrew Zimbalist, but it was derived through a very different methodology, not counting the income taxes of project residents--a controversial tactic used by Zimbalist. Stuckey said the state was more conservative in its methodology but emphasized the overall benefit.
And it was quite an extensive list...

“Get behind” or some form thereof is used in the gospels more commonly as positive “follow me”, but its stern negative character here is indicated by the addition of “Satan”. The use of the Adversary as a sort of description for the disciples’ mindset indicates how far from God’s ways is this rejection of Jesus’ death and suffering. The disciples are acting more for Satan than God in opposing Jesus’ passion. (France)

In Tangled Up in You, Rachel Gibson introduces readers to a stray kitten that adopts the cat-hating heroine. We have to love the kitten, not just because of the cute factor but also because it has spunk. The kitten has decided where she wants to live, and no mere human is going to tell her otherwise.

Last fall, in the first post that featured Belle,
She looks for an attendant, who sends her to another gate to call for help, and at first, she leaves her baggage unattended near the desk where before she left the glass, but she finishes the wine in the glass, and then she walks again between you and the person in front of you to go and look for help. After let’s say five minutes, she comes back, she notices that her queue has gone further because they started the boarding process, but she hasn’t found someone to clean the floor yet, so she grabs her baggage, she passes through the wine, spreading it around, and goes away… She comes back with the person in charge of the cleaning, who then goes away to take the wet floor signs..

Thatcher: I received an email on Thursday from Henny Swan, accessibility consultant at the Royal National Institute of the Blind, RNIB in the UK. She said, about John, "my thoughts go out to all his family and friends at this time. I have never met him and yet feel a great loss; I can only imagine how those close to him feel."
Analysts believe that UK authorities, media, and anti-Muslim campaigns have been inflaming anti-Muslim prejudice by criticizing and even declaring open season on Muslims. The so-called prejudice has apparently changed to systematic and open state discrimination in the country.
Bikini Kill leader and contributing initiator of the Riot Grrrl movement, Kathleen Hanna, saw the musical and ethical importance in DC’s Fugazi and label the group as a creative and social inspiration (Hanna, 2011). Hanna recounts the first time she witnessed Fugazi, after Bikini Kill band mate, Tobi Vail, dragged her into the sold out show. “Oh my God, Boys talking about sexism?! This is amazing!” (Prato, 2009). Hanna went on to form many creative groups and incited her own influential ideals, one of which being a Riot Grrrl Manifesto; an empowering statement that delivered the intrinsic morals of the feminist movement with a punk attitude (Hanna, 1991). The ideas published by Kathleen Hanna in Bikini Kill Zine 2 would suggest that the vocal incessancy on the topic of gender and feminism, would brand Ian MacKaye as a supporter of Riot Grrrl and the feminist movement (Schippers, 2002). I, too, uphold and support these fundamental ideas of gender equality. The impact of MacKaye’s protest against sexual prejudice and the adoption of feminist ideals set a new standard for Fugazi’s audience.

God’s revelation or rhema to Noah caused him to step out in faith and build an ark. I’m sure he hadn’t taken classes in engineering, ship building or zoology. (Genesis 6) Obedience to God’s revelation led Gideon to attack and overcome a huge enemy army with only 300 men who were armed with clay pots hiding torches in one hand, and trumpets in the other! (Judges 7) Revelation gave Joseph the interpretation of Pharaoh’s dream, which promoted him from slave/prisoner to the highest government position possible, saving God’s people from starvation during the drought. (Genesis 41) It led Jesus to the cross and gave Him the power to overcome sin and death, bringing salvation, hope and deliverance to all who will believe and trust in Him. (Romans 8)

Forecasts then, at this midpoint? I think Saga will continue to develop her nascent human qualities under Martin’s tutelage. I also think that Martin will find he has some connection to the killer as why else wouldn’t he shoot him? Thinking about the set-up of the police corruption idea, this may well be the killer’s next target, the next ‘problem’ he wants to expose. I have no idea who the killer is at all, which is either a really good or a really bad thing. What do you think is going to happen in the next instalment?
"Images of Mary breastfeeding Jesus were once ubiquitous in churches around the world. But eventually in North America, as the artificial feeding of babies became more popular, and the plastic bottle replaced the breast, our nipplephobia got the best of us and these sacred images all but disappeared from churches and art galleries in North America."

The Jeffersons’ unappreciated joy in life is their yard. They edge and cut the grass themselves. There’s never a blade out of place. There’s no crab grass, only green, dark green grass, green from waterin’ just the right amount. They invest in appliances. They don’t accumulate junk. Every tool has a place. It’s there when a tool is not in use. They always own new cars. They never sale one without a trade in. Horny toads don’t stand a chance in their yard.

A whole generation failed to receive the inheritance God had for them because the words spoken by the ten spies robbed them of their courage. See, words can carry doubt; they can carry fear; they can carry anger; they can carry hatred; they can carry despair. Or they can carry love; they can carry hope; they can carry courage; they can carry healing. Are your words ministering positive things to those who hear them or negative things? Are they building up, or are they tearing down? The choice is up to us but rest assured we will do one or the other!

They think that they are suffering for the sake of their children, or because they have no option. The fact is that they have rejected other options as worse and selected this as the best.

I just wish the Government would realise that comprehensive education is under-performing. The abolition of grammar schools was, in my opinion, the single worst decision made my any Government regarding education and this needs to be remedied if the next generation are going to receive the education they deserve and are entitled to.

The Big Ten’s destination dilemma is inherent within the current bowl/BCS system. The big bowl games always have been played in the south and west, and because of the “double-hosting” model, the same holds true for the national championship games. Most Big Ten fans understand the reasons behind this, and have willingly hopped on airplanes every December and traveled far and wide to see their teams play. It’s this willingness that has made Big Ten teams so attractive to BCS bowl committees.

A lot of people who don’t believe in God are that way because they’re great intellectual types…they even pride themselves in how intellectual they are. I am not saying that’s always the case…but I’m saying in some cases it’s true. And even those intellectuals who do believe in God, reject the God of the Bible. They simply can’t wrap their brains around it in a way that makes sense to their great intellects.
Thanking those involved in bringing the project together, he pointed out that bureaucracy could be overwhelming and difficult as he once again called for red tape to be cut in order to save money.
We moved home a number of times when I was a child. When I had my tonsils and adenoids removed we were living on the outskirts of Bath where my father, after completing theological studies at Ridley Hall Cambridge, took up his first position as curate of St Phillip's Church Odd Down. It was from there, at the age of nine, that I became a boarder at Wells Cathedral School. Home and school were healthy environments with plenty of fresh air and exercise and I was the kind of child who would happily spend hours at any game that involved kicking or hitting a ball. Photographs of me in those days show a boy of normal build for his age.

When they got married Janie changed her first name too. She is Jenny Smith now, no longer Janie Hunter. She colors her hair and takes care of her children like any other mother in the PTA. But some people at this table, from the prosecutors office, who couldn’t believe that what had happened so long ago hadn’t twisted Jenny through to the heart and soul. They always threw in the possibility that they thought she had done it on purpose. So, here they where back again this year.
You really can’t forgive a guy like that, no matter what he says; all you can do is thank God and your father that you didn’t marry him, and then you add that porn movie question to your growing list of things to be sure you check out before you say yes to a first date.
Consumerism it said had “taken root in culture upon culture over the past half-century … (and) become a powerful driver of the inexorable increase in demand for resources and production of waste that marks our age”.
Trapped in my house by a freakishly big storm for North Carolina (that led to school being cancelled for a week, mind you), I watched the movie "Julie & Julia" - you know, the one about a woman named Julie who decides to cook her way through Julia Child's cookbook and start a blog about it? Well, I had just published a family cookbook and given it as a Christmas present to all the ladies in my family. Inspired by Julie, I decided I should cook my way through my own family's cookbook (though not as ambitiously as Julie, who only gave herself a year!).

The worst thing about digital clocks is that many children do not know how to really read time. They learn on pre-school worksheets, struggling to draw the hour and minute hands properly, then promptly forget when there are no clocks in their everyday surroundings.

She's right. Publishing is still a predominantly white industry. It would be great to see more writers of different ethnicity. And it would be great to see more characters of color represented in our books. They don't have to be by minority authors only. I would love to see all authors challenge themselves by writing outside their comfort zone and embrace our multi-cultural world. All I ask is that they do it with integrity and represent us honestly and not as some stock stereotypical character. It's not hard to do if you do your research and treat your characters with respect. Like Libba does.

As the book progresses, the reader recounts the unexpected hope experienced in the 2010 season as each passing week brought us closer to healing, closer to rebuilding, and closer to redemption. Psalms of Thanksgiving are recalled for win after win, as the 2010 Tigers marched closer to the ultimate prize. Nomel recalls specific games and personal experiences to relate to several selected psalms, experiences certainly shared by any reader who experienced similar moments along the roller coaster of 2010.
It took a good 12 weeks for me to truly eradicate every trace of gluten from my diet. Overcoming each setback from unintended exposure took all the determination I could muster. How much gluten is safe for a celiac? Zero was the answer given by the Celiac Sprue Association of America back when I was first diagnosed. I continue to agree. Even a speck of gluten the size of a crumb is enough to trigger the body’s immune system to attack itself. Which means eating out is very risky- a topic worthy of its own post.

Habits allow us to tackle the everyday challenges we face in life. We have evolved from animals that use their natural instinct to survive. Habits come from repetition; what we did yesterday, we will do today whether it is necessarily a positive or negative decision.
One day God calls Satan up on the telephone and says with a sneer, "So, how's it going down there in hell?" Satan replies, "Hey, things are going great. We've got air conditioning and flush toilets and escalators, and there's no telling what this engineer is going to come up with next."
In Pandemonium everything has changed completely since Delirium most importantly Lena. At the beginning of the book Lena talks about being reborn in The Wilds and I completely agree with that statement. Lena has evolved completely from the well behaved law abiding citizen she was when we first met her in Delirium and is now strong and hardened after her time in The Wilds. To go along with this new Lena she has a new home in The Wilds and new friends and family too in particular Raven who’s like a mother, sister, best friend and mentor all rolled into one for Lena and who I absolutely loved. Like Lena we leave her old life behind the fence and emerge into a new chapter of her life.

It should be remembered that with the help of the world and South African media, the ANC was able to paint the SA white as a nation of Nazi's. They conjured up some of the most shocking lies ever experienced in the history of the World. Even the younger generation white and black South Africans have been brainwashed into believing that Apartheid was a violent inhumane atrocious system where blacks were shot in the street on Sundays for fun. They actually believe that white school children used blacks for target practice, so feeble-minded, uneducated and gullible are they.

Added to that is the awkward placement of what I call the linen closet. It's at the far end of the hallway by the boys room.

Whenever I start a transcription, it usually begins with two or three recordings. When I was transcribing the Shostakovich Preludes and Fugues the recordings that helped me hear the voicings for my arrangement were Roger Woodward’s on Celestial Harmonies (read my post about Roger Woodward’s recording) and Tatiana Nikolaeva’s on Melodiya. I followed the same formula for the Brahms as well. I listened to several different recordings of the Intermezzo and there were three particular recordings that I pulled inspiration from: Arthur Rubinstein’s on RCA Red Seal, Julius Katchen’s on London, and Radu Lupu’s on Decca. From these three, I put together an ideal composite of how I imagined the string parts would sound like. Take a listen to the Radu Lupu recording below and compare it to my string quartet transcription.

I had never had cherries jubilee before so I had no idea what it was supposed to taste like; it ended up tasting like caramelized cherries, but not with an overwhelming cherry taste. So I pureed the sauce, and then mixed a portion of it with cream cheese, to give the filling a bit more tartness. Then I made a batch of whipped cream, which I then folded into the cherry cream cheese mixture.

I cut a 'wave' template out of cardboard and sprayed some glimmer mist over it for my background. I think I need to be a bit more heavy handed with the old glimmer mist as it always seems to look really faint on my layouts! The starfish is made out of Fimo and covered in Dimensional Magic and I just added a couple of strips of Fancy Pants and MME paper.

We were made in God’s image, and after His likeness; three parts – body, soul and mind – representative of the Trinity – Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The soul is a spirit, an intelligent, immortal spirit, an active spirit. The mind consists of authority and dominion, the government of the inferior creatures, as it were, God’s representative on earth. It also represented the freedom of our will which has in it more of God’s image than our government of life here on earth. Lastly, our body, planned in the beginning of time for the arrival of God as a baby. Walking upright to correlate to the authority given to us on earth.

In choosing my re-post for Seth Apter's Buried Treasure collaboration, I looked back through my posts with an eye to 1) what seemed to resonate with my readers, and 2) what still resonated most with me. In the end, I chose 2 posts which address questions about the importance of art from the artist's perspective; in other words, why do we do it, and is it worth it? I hope you like them.
And SDO has also been found to predict the tendency to express racial preferences (e.g. Heaven & St. Quintin, 2003). So let's look at what the other half of the items in the SDO scale say: They say things like: "Inferior groups should stay in their place", "Superior groups should dominate inferior groups" and "Some groups of people are just more worthy than others". So people who believe that there are inferior and superior groups also believe that there are inferior and inferior races. How astounding! Since races are groups, the finding that the SDO scale predicts racism is in fact LOGICALLY ENTAILED. It parades as an empirical finding but it is not. It tells us nothing new about the world. It is merely something that is true by definition. What a fraud!
Romney, like the Bush family, has a very low regard for objective truths. Why should they when they have been so successful at buying the impression of success. In a media saturated culture, with a memory that clings to sex scandals yet cannot name at least four Supreme Court justices, Romney has little disincentive to give up delusions he has spent a life time cultivating.

And so, some of you are encountering these mighty angels of pink, and you really do not know what to do with them, because externally they are huge. You can even perceive their wings, their six layers of wings, their fierce independence, their enormous beauty and grace, and their core of independence, their core of steel, because they are very clear about who they are. And they really do not need human direction. They really do not need any direction!

On the flip side, his challenger Gary McDowell has been extremely successful at fundraising, especially for coming off a loss in the 2010 cycle. While being out-fundraised by Benishek, McDowell only trails Benishek in “cash on hand” by a measly 10k, or around 2%. He also holds a 20% edge individual contributions, telling us his fundraising “net” is much wider and may last much longer.

I recently read someone’s draft novel: over 107,000 words without a single typo. That's an amazing achievement for a writer working alone, with no proof-reading help. It was a highly polished piece of writing. What he had missed were the serious structural issues and that there was far too much interior monologue.

Unlike the decisions of the executive board, it’s also difficult to scrutinise shariah decisions because they’re not made public: minutes are rarely kept, and if they are they’re not shared. Even in widely reported disputes, scholars tend not to discuss their personal opinions publicly, for reputational reasons. ‘All the arguments around the Goldman Sachs sukuk haven’t been the scholars arguing, it’s been various commentators,’ says Nigel Denison, director and head of markets and wealth management at Bank of London and the Middle East (BLME). ‘The scholars themselves try not to get into that situation. There’s a relatively small group of scholars, so often you would find yourself criticising the board that has one of the top scholars on it.’
This one is hard because I’m not at home so I usually go up to the food court (yikes) and grab something that is 100% protein.

I will work on this when I get home.

Commentators, speak of a “common British character” as if British genes are injected into arrivals at what is laughably called 'Immigration control'. A British character is no more something one develops by the act of getting off a plane at Heathrow than a French Character is something you gain by arriving at Paris Charles de Gaulle.

The first European to set foot on the Galápagos Islands was the fourth Bishop of Panama, the Dominican Fray Tomás de Berlanga. In order to settle a territorial dispute between the conquistadors Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro, Berlanga sailed to Peru but strong winds blew his ship off course. He arrived at the islands on 10th March 10 1535 before continuing his journey.

In Dave's defence, he does suffer from debilitating illness and he is lonely, but this does not give him the right to con other bloggers. I was quite fond of Dave, he was one of my most regular visitors. He does have the capacity to be very witty and entertaining. I don't believe he set out to deliberately hurt anyone and he is very afraid of his deteriorating health. Perhaps he couldn't say this as Dave. One of Jane's most poignant lines was simply: I'm scared and alone.

Genre of course affects how often you use these. Suspense, Thriller, Mystery, and even Comedy often use this device. But moderation is key to using any punctuation in any genre. But again, your word choice, narrative and dialogue are responsible for creating these effects. Otherwise, agents and editors will consider your work lazy.

This is a way of saying the “godly” married the “ungodly.” It is simply a picture of intermarrying between those who have faith and those who do not. In this senario the SOG = the descendants of Seth who remained the People of God, and the DOM = the descendants of Cain who ran from God. There may be a lot of things going on here, continuing on the theme that Eve is the one who sinned so the “daughters” are the ungodly, they follow the ways of “man” and not the ways of God. This view basically focus on the fact that they “godly” got yoked together with “ungodly.”

Hulk is my favorite Marvel character, there is something pure about him. After reading a few issues of the recent Hulk books after a long absence, I’ve come to the conclusion that Hulk should not have his own book, let alone several, and Hulk is one of the very few Marvel characters I still like anymore. They’ve played him as a misunderstood monster for years now, but it’s only led to silly story lines and some flat out bullshit in regards to his character. It’s time that Marvel writers confront Hulk for what he actually is, pure righteous wrath.

Getxo and Bilbao have odors attached to them. As you stroll past different shops, they each have their own scent. It’s mainly a food I do not recognize unless it is a fish. If a store doesn’t have a scent, you smell smoke. Spaniards smoke like chimneys. I am curious to how much tobacco goes through the country on a given day. There is not the same health concerns surrounding cigarettes here as in the States. Spaniards smoke inside their homes (such as my roommates), and they will smoke in front of their newborns. They smoke so much that I am starting to differentiate the different cigarette smells. If it were not for the somewhat recent law that outlawed smoking inside public facilities, I think Spaniards would have a cigarette glued to their lip.

It is also very easy to make and ideal for those that don't have the time to make a traditional Christmas cake (like me last Christmas).

Unfortunately, a moderate Republican like Romney is highly unlikely to do that, not because he is a moderate, a squish-a "RINO", if you will. No, it is simply because Romney's company, Bain Capital, that great bird of prey, like many other private equity firms, have thrived under the current regulatory system.
I periodically tell Spence that if he ever poops on the rug again, bites me, runs in the opposite direction when I tell him to come, or proceeds to hide in Diego's room (both Spence and Charlie consider Diego's room, and particularly under Diego's bed, a place of magic and wonder), I will slit his throat, skin him alive, and wear his pretty little fur as a scarf. Sometimes just one, sometimes all of them.

First: It must be understood what Judeo-Christianity (also called “evangelicalism,” dispensationalism, or Christians Zionism) is: by any name, a 20th Century phenomena, an apostate-cult, meaning it practices, in part, a deviant path of following Christ, and it relies upon many varied human sources other than the traditional bible(s) for its theology.(4)(5)
There is many a delightful library scene in the Harry Potter series, of course.

I find that in our daily lives we doubt ourselves so much, we devalue our work, and sometimes we get put down by others. Sometimes we feel like we are just another ant in the army, another cog in the wheel, just an individual office worker within a firm of 700+ office workers. This can be a really daunting experience – the feeling of no self worth and no sense of individual expression.

Alright, so, the more comfortable a baby is in the water when they start, the faster they will get through each lesson and the more they would be able to get out of the lessons as a whole. (Well, DUH! That's kind of a given.) So, we decided to try and get Laney a little more comfortable going UNDER the water (And get myself a little more comfortable watching her BE under the water). So, we sat our older children along the side of the pool and then, one at a time, we had them fall off and into the water. They would lean forward, fall in, their heads would go under and then we would scoop them out. Laney sat and watched for a while. Then, it was her turn......

It's no secret that in the past knits and I didn't quite jive. There have been a whole lot of sewing disasters revolving around that tricky fabric but when I saw Rae's new retro t-shirt pattern I knew I had to try again. There are a TON of people making this pattern this week and there's a really good reason why. It's just about as close to instant gratification as you can get! I made these two shirts in under an hour and I'm addicted. I can't wait to make more. I figured out how to use the stretch stitch on my machine and that combined with using a ballpoint needle my past frustrations were just that, a thing of the past. There is still a little wavyness especially on the brown shirt but I was able to press most of it out. The fit is perfect and there are tons of ways you could customize these. I did short sleeve versions on both of mine. The brown one I used contrasting avacado colored fabric from an old t-shirt and I love that look. I also top-stitched in a contrast thread. Miss Mabel actually squealed when she saw that one and went on to say how "boot-tiful" the "polky dots" were. It was awesome.

Of course, we took our snorkel gear and went snorkeling. Best part of the trip for me is being in the ocean and seeing all the beautiful fish. And, we did get to see one tiny turtle this time. I actually got photos of it--we rented an underwater camera and I took a couple hundred photos during the week that we had it. Some even turned out! Taking underwater photos is a challenge, when the ocean is moving you and the fish, usually in different directions! But it certainly is fun trying!

Elegant flowers, wild wind-tossled 'hair', shaggy trunk ... fabulous.

The so-called load shedding (blackouts) that were mainly applied in the northern suburbs (or at least that's the impression I got). Loadshedding is when they turn off the electricity to certain areas for hours at a time. The worst one was on the Thursday when they turned off the electricity to practically all of the northern suburbs (Bryanston, Rivonia, Morningside, Woodmead to mention just the few I drove through), for more than 4 hours. No one in the area was able to work, the traffic was standing everywhere and it was just toal chaos. I was going to Pretoria with R to pick up mom, and when we got to Pretoria, they were loadshedding there too. Just never got away from it.

Our first stop was Marshall's. We drove a bit to find a parking spot and stepped out of our air conditioned bubble and into the oppressive heat known as August in South Florida.

The human ear is designed to receive natural sounds lying in the range 5 kHz to 15 kHz. Our hearing threshold is maximum near 4-5 kHz. That is why the sound of a Buzzer, Cricket (the noisy insect) etc are piercing and irritating to us. These sound vibrations create stress on the ear drum because the eardrum will not vibrate exactly similar to the sound waves. In order to avoid such frequencies, the middle ear act as a low pass filter and prevent them passing into the inner ear. Natural sounds including human voice lies between 10-15 kHz which is friendly to human ear. Sound of unusual frequencies cause noise pollution and alters our psychomotor performances.
Dear people of The Next Web, congratulations on a job very well done and see you next week.
The retaking of Crater became a symbol of the true British spirit. This is an example of when righteous rebellion is heroic. Mitchell is a role model for a new generation who are having their inheritance dissipated by the elites.
Sometimes we sing an old hymn which has the words. “I serve a Risen Saviour, He’s in the world today I know that He is living, whatever men may say, I see His hand of mercy, I hear His voice of cheer, and just the time I need Him, He’s always near. The chorus ends, “You ask me how I know He lives? He lives within my heart.” Doubt goes when we personally commit ourselves to Jesus the Risen Lord, and make Him the Lord, Master, of our hearts.

Our friends explained that God already knew I was a hopeless mess and loved me anyway. Opening the door to Heaven was a gift that cost God everything. It was on the cross Jesus died to pay for my sins. He rose again to prove forever that He is the Truth. Weeping at such love, I knelt and gave Christ my life. I found that, with or without a happy family, no one is ever complete without Jesus.
And it remained that way until one day in college when I learned that my perfect Midwestern town was a hotbed for the Klu Klux Klan, and home to three John Birch Society chapters and that during the height of the civil rights marches, town fathers were on the roofs of the Elks and the Moose lodges on opposite ends of town with rifles and shotguns waiting for those people to try to march into our town. The Norman Rockwell façade began to fade away as the realities of the underbelly of my perfect town were exposed.
I always love it when a director can immerse me in a film by the way he/she plays on the emotions they want me to feel. Recently I watched ‘I Spit on Your Grave’ (2010 Dir: Steven R. Monroe) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1242432/ and I was amazed at how my emotions were dragged around. From reading the blurb on the back of the DVD case I know what to expect, so I sat down with my friends ready to back it down and pick holes at it. Surprisingly I didn’t. The one character in the film that I expected to sympathise with the entire time (a simpleton named Matthew) I ended up hating and couldn’t wait for the main protagonist to get her revenge. Normal I would hate the idea of watching a film where three quarters of the film is dedicated to the build up of and the eventual rape of the main protagonist, but I didn’t mind, because it was all necessary to get the emotions of hatred towards the preportraitors of the rape and to feel the encouragement and support for her ultimate revenge.

Since this is a romance, what we all hope for is a happy ending. While we're never really in any doubt that we'll get just that, Simone Elkeles places obstacles between Kiara and Carlos that even Romeo and Juliet would falter at. There's a very real sense of just how difficult gangs make it for their members to leave, and yet Carlos does seem to wriggle out of things a little too easily at times. As in Perfect Chemistry, expect an epilogue you'll either love or hate; this one is just as corny and more than a little unnecessary, but ultimately it doesn't detract from the intoxicating romance that precedes it. Rules of Attraction is compelling, it's steamy, and it's fun. Fans of YA romance will devour it.
That’s an excusable position to have if you’re a Republican senior in Florida who’s been inundated with a blizzard of anti-Newt ads and you have no memory of the 1980′s and/or no acquaintance with the right-wing blogosphere, where you can find the corrected record. Romney’s scorched earth campaign against Newt has been so full of over the top, hypocritical distortions – I don’t think I’ve ever seen anything like it in a Republican primary. Mitt is making as many bitter enemies on the right, as he will have on the left if/when he’s the Republican nominee. How does this make him the best candidate to beat Obama?

Another side to Peter's professional activity involves representing indigent clients in pro bono cases in a variety of fields, finding consumer advocacy the best way for him to give back to his community and to hone his negotiation skills. He first acquired an interest in negotiation when he represented his law school in the Willem C. Vis International Commercial Arbitration Moot held each year in Vienna, Austria. One of his most loved books is about negotiation: Roger Fisher and William L. Ury’s Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In.
Christchurch is being compared to a war zone: transport, water, power and communication are down or unreliable, there are still bodies lying on the streets and buildings burning. Yet despite this people can still get on a plane and escape. Their family can text them to make sure they’re fine, and their friends gather pledges on the internet. We’re still at heart a civilised nation which has not lost its humanity enough to help others, and to deeply feel for others. And for that we can be grateful, not guilty.
To combat the sub-50 degree temperatures, many residents were forced to keep their NorthFace down parkas on all day (along with their cashmere socks and sweaters). Stocks of split and dried Vermont firewood and Ralph Lauren Home candles have grown dangerously low.

In its ‘self-referral’ state, or transcendental state, consciousness knows itself alone; as such, it is the knower of itself. By being the knower of itself, it is also the object of knowledge, and the process of knowing. Thus, in its self-referral state, consciousness is the unified state of knower, knowing, and known.
If I had to choose to have you as a loving young sister or a loving adult sister, I choose the adult sister hands down. I used to mourn not having you near when we were kids. I used to think that I missed out on this huge thing, but ya know what? You can give me a heck of a lot more support and love now, than you ever could have been capable of then. And you do Leah. I no longer look back and feel pain or sadness over our relationship, but I use it as a marker to see how far we have come.

The veneration of relics is a practice nearly as old as the church itself, but began in earnest after Bishop Ambrose of Milan displayed the relics of two martyrs in his church between A.D. 385-388. Veneration of the relics was thought then to aid in worship.

Menu options are very clear. Image quality varies from acceptable to quite good, with overall quality improving substantially in the last few discs, undoubtedly owing to the enormous strides in digital technology over the past decade. Combing, aliasing, ghosting and a general softness crop up in the worst offenders. Subtitling is good, with exceptions noted in the individual capsule reviews. There are no supplements.

Before venturing further, please allow me to indulge with a rhetorical question. What band wouldn't want to have a song in their repertoire called "Sensual Cardboard Experience?" With that ponderous notion out of the way, here's a vintage Pedaljets cassette with that dandy little number on it. I shared their first album, Today, Today shortly after starting Wilfully Obscure in mid 2007. Hell if I know if the Rapidshare link is still active or not (keep your fingers crossed). An online bio described them as the missing link between the Replacements and Nirvana. I think the quote from my write-up four years ago holds a little more water:
Haarlem is a beautiful city. If you go, arm yourself with a guide and a map and get walking.
The Melting Pot cookbook features recipes from all different ethnic (Mennonite) groups all over Europe including Dutch, Swiss, German, Polish, and even Russian. It includes so many neat little histories like a detailed description of hog slaughtering day, and the meals the women prepared during it, told by a Russian man, and of course, recipes. It struck me that most of the recipes are really like peasant cooking--very little spices or adulteration and few ingredients. A Dutch vegetable soup was comprised of just potatoes, carrots and celery, and "10 kernels of whole clove" and salt and pepper. The boiled potatoes recipe (also Dutch) was potatoes, water and salt, with a note of caution that the Dutch are very particular about the texture of their boiled potatoes. "Potatoes must be flaky when dished up!" Few instructions are given, and recipes don't indicate what to do with ingredients like vegetables; no "diced," "chopped," "minced," etc. I love to study these old cookbooks and see how dishes were prepared, and really, how recipes were written. I feel like it is training me a bit by making me think about cooking and why things are prepared the way they are. I've already got scores of pages marked for things I want to try like Dutch Pea Soup (better start planning now to acquire a pig's ear and a pig's trotter), and the more easy-to-come-by corn pudding, made from our heirloom corn, Hickory King, that we're growing on the farm.
At 9:05 my doctor was called to come over for delivery. Her office is right across the street . I don't know how she got to the hospital so fast but she was there before I knew it. They nurses started coming it and reality sunk in. It's time to have a baby. I was scared..so scared. How could I love another baby as much as I loved Maddie? But I knew our Hope was coming. So I started pushing. 20ish minutes later Jackson was born sunny side up (we didnt know he was sunny side up all my ultra sounds said he was head down). The nurses put him on my chest and I was in love. He was perfect. He had the darkest brown hair and there was so much of it.
I used a pair of adult size plastic angel wings. I purchased mine from Sun Dog Imports on ebay several years ago for about $15. Each is 33" tall x 13" wide. They are very, very lightweight plastic. There was no way to hang them. Even if could hang them they would have gone all cattywampus because they are so flimsy. I decided to use cotton quilt batting to line the insides. It made the wings more sturdy and opaque. I layered the batting with Tacky Glue until I felt like they were sturdy enough. Be certain to line every inch! I used lots of glue! Almost two 16oz bottles! What I really like about these wings is the convex shape. I considered using them as a mold for papier mache but decided against it for now. I have another (white) pair in the basement that I might attempt use in that fashion.
So I was not entirely excited about this evening. I briefly considered smuggling in my IPod and listening to the Gorillaz instead.

When I arrived back at work, it was stil pouring rain and I had to park at the far end of the parking lot so I kept my fire coat on because it is waterproof. I ran into my class area with it on and the kids immediately zeroed in on me. Who could blame them? I stood out in that bright orange coat! Usually when I address the class at this time of day, it is hard to get them quiet and get their attention. This time was an exception. All eyes were on me, expectantly and it was dead quiet. They KNEW if I was wearing that coat it meant only one thing. I got to the front of the class and the questions started flooding out of their mouths. I told them what I had been up to and warned them that I smelled bad from the smoke. Of course, as soon as they had the opportunity they were all up and around me sniffing! LOL One of them later asked me, "Mrs. Myers, why are you so dirty?" I laughed. I told him I wasn't dirty I had just been walking through the smoke from the fire and it smelled bad. He just assumed that if one was smelly one must be dirty. I love my kids!

9. Perseverance. The other side of the coin of originality is perseverance. Creativity requires both. It is impossible to accomplish anything important without acquiring a certain amount of self-discipline. Current child-rearing practices are woefully short on this trait.

As I walked-out the store, I saw a young black-male running towards the door. He had a pair of pantyhose on his head. But I could still clearly see his face. I already knew what was happening. I waited by the door....he ran out what seemed like seconds later....and I tried to grab the bag with cash but failed. He dropped some, I picked it up and handed it to the manager.
This is very serious and we see the ultimate consequence of these actions in failed ministries and damaged people. I believe that most people who are compelled but not called do so out of a desire to serve God; I believe that they have gifts and talents (i.e. preaching, prophetic, administrative) that are essential to the proper operation of a church or ministry, but that doesn’t mean they are called to be a Pastor, Prophet, Apostle, Teacher or Evangelist.
Here is my daughter and her bestie. Watch out boys, because these country girls know how to throw a calf down and castrate them too!!

But the measure of Eric’s lyric writing cannot fully be taken by noting his ability to utter pithy and evocative lines. He’s also really good at taking songs in unexpected directions, changing their courses on a dime – as we saw in the first two lines of “Don’t Hold Your Breath.” That skill appears again later in the same song, by the way he finishes a line that begins with the words “it’s been a long time . . .” Those words are generally the intellectual property of the wistful, who finish the thought with things like “since I drank champagne,” or “since I smelled honeysuckle blossoms,” or whatever. Eric’s finish, though, is quite different, and results in a line as startling as it is convicting:
That $246 billion for interest might explain, in part, why there were precisely zero votes for the Obama budget in Congress, by the way, since we had paid $454 billion in interest the preceding year. What, precisely, did Obama think was going to happen to either the interest rate or the debt that was going to reduce our interest by a whopping 46% in one year?

I watched enthralled as a group of frightened looking soldiers with laser guns took up positions in a bright white corridor, levelling their weapons at the door at the far end of the passage. What could they possibly be so scared of, I wondered to myself. They had laser guns for goodness sake, (yes I know they're called blasters but at that point they were just laser guns) what could possibly worry someone with a laser gun? I had no idea at the time that I was about to get my answer.

With the lights being dimmed we knew it was time to head back to the condo and figure out some dinner arrangements before Team Hines had to run back up I-85. We decided to keep things easy and fun so with take out from 5 napkin burgers, we sat around the dining room table and chatted into the early evening about our adventures in the museum. The two days of hanging with Team Hines and visiting some of Midtown’s highlights in the Botanical Gardens and the High Museum were an excellent way to kick off the Spring season, hopefully you and yours will have equally fun adventures in the weeks ahead. As always thanks for stopping by and checking out my meanderings…

Here’s a synopsis, written in the form of a letter to an imaginary editor:
Last night we celebrated Fat Tuesday with just our family. This is really different from our normal celebration with neighbors and friends. Fat Tuesday is usually a production at our house. This year it followed too closely after two birthdays, Valentine's Day and a five days of travel over President's Day weekend. I decided it was better to remain sane and enjoy the day rather than pack in one more thing.
Today's tip brought to you by:
I had a few hours free this morning and what did I decide to do? I decided to queue, along with what seemed like hundreds of like minded individuals, over at H and M to await the unveiling of their collaboration with Marni. As far as queues go, it wasn't too bad. I was in line outside the store for about an hour and to prevent general chaos from descending, we were let in by groups of 35. Once inside we were given 10 minutes inside the designated Marni zone to choose and we were limited to 5 articles. I realize how crazy this sounds but as I had made it to that point, it seemed even crazier to just up and leave. I suppose its organized this way so as not to have general chaos but once inside the zone, it was a free for all. People grabbing stuff off the racks, with some becoming really aggressive.
To my knowledge, no bacterial contamination occurred in this barrel-aged release, though it is entirely possible. That is part of the adventure in barrel aging beer is the unknown variables. We keep close watch on our barrel aged beers, opening them briefly only once a month to let out excess carbon dioxide, and to monitor its maturation. The tartness in this particular barrel absolutely comes from the deep, complex port wine that was aged in the barrel previously, and has a more rounded edge than would be created by lactic-acid producing bacteria in such a short amount of time. In order for lactic acid producing bacteria (typically L.Delbrueckii and Pediococcus sp.) to develop roundness and complexity, it takes at least a year, a higher pH, and typically lower alcohol than our 9.4% abv Belgian inspired brew. Though I am not ruling it out entirely, I am not calling this a sour beer, and being extremely familiar with lactic-acid (we sour mash our bourbon at Ranger Creek, and lactic-acid has a very distinct tartness more akin to citric acid/lemony flavor), my guess is that it is the port's acidity we are detecting. I do love a good sour ale, and I love the beautiful critters vehemently feared by wine makers, and we have some of those working with us in the brewery now, producing what we hope to be even more complex barrel-aged ales that we will be releasing when they reach maturation.
I had picked up a fresh turkey (12 lbs) from my local meat shop, made a bread stuffing and roasted it to perfection. There was potatoes and other assorted veggies, a lusciously dark gravy and for dessert, something a wee bit different. It is very traditional to have pumpkin pie. I didn't feel like making one, as I had whipped up another one of those maple pumpkin cheesecakes for Monday's family gathering, so I picked up the next best thing: pumpkin pie ice cream!!! The MoS had never had it and wasn't too sure he'd like it. He loves pumpkin pie and I assured him since that was the case, he would definitely like the ice cream! Needless to say, it was a hit.

Before I touch on the XC season thus far, this past weekend was a great one on the roads. Sammy Wanjiru broke Khalid Khannouchi's Chicago course record by 1 second with his 2:05:41. It was the fastest marathon run on US soil. Wanjiru who is only 22 is now 4 and 0 in the major marathons. His 4 wins have all been between 2:05.10 and 2:06.39. Amazing athlete. Props need to be given to this years pacemakers. Patrick Ivuti (2007 Chicago Marathon champ and a pacesetter this year) led the group through the 1/2 marathon in 1:01.59-1:02.00.
You need to wait for the announcement about the birth of the baby and the inevitable height and weight declaration. When I get this information, I cut curling ribbon that exact length, and fill a plastic container with water so it weighs roughly the same as the baby. A gallon-sized container filled with water will weigh roughly 10 pounds, so you can adjust from there. Then when I announce that the baby was born and give all the details, I can pass around the ribbon and plastic container so the students have an actual visual of how big the baby is. I also like to discuss that just like the ribbon, babies are all curled up and the nurses have to stretch the baby out to get the length. You can discuss comparisons such as, "What else do you know that is about this size?" Or, "What surprised you about this?" For the little ones, I usually put the water and ribbon in a science center so they can explore further.
So yesterday I was coming back to my office after running inside for a second. As I was coming back out, I stubbed my right toes on a metal bed frame that was leaning against the wall. I must have been distracted by the telephone... Anyway, my toes on my right foot now are all swollen up and gross looking. Well, they weren't pretty to begin with... I don't paint my toe nails and have never trusted anyone to give me a pedicure. I'm ticklish and will likely kick them. So my toes are ugly.

The three forms of security for wireless connections commonly encountered by home computer users today are WEP, WPA, and WPA2, which refer to forms of encryption. At this point, neither WEP nor WPA are considered to be secure, even though they are often the default protocol on home routers. In general, unless there is a compelling need to trade off security for connection to an older device that does not support WPA2, you should configure your router to use WPA2.
And what of the modern world? The English built it. The industrial revolution began in England and enabled the Anglosphere to progress from subsistence for the masses to affluence and lifestyles the rest of the world could only dream of. The inventions and the inventors behind so much of what we take for granted today came from us, from the English, from England.
Fit: the tiny word that causes untold frustration. It’s the Holy Grail of garment sewers. It’s probably the number one reason home sewers give up garment sewing. My personal sewing library includes an entire section devoted exclusively to fit. Then there are the “systems” and products promising the perfect fit that so many of us have purchased, only to be disappointed. Peggy Sagers of Silhouette Patterns likens these products to diet pills. Everyone is so desperate for a “magic bullet”, they fall for the hype that gets them to buy yet another diet book or click on an ad promising to reveal the “secret” to painless weight loss.

“The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now. And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for? But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.”
In my view not much else is of any significance. All of Ben Shapiro's talking points may be true. They likely are nothing more than conjecture. Then again does it really matter? bin Laden is dead, we should all be willing to give credit where credit is due. Now, isn't it time to move on to the real issues for which this President should be denied a second term?
A.O Scott focused on the American Short Story in the New York Times, but the refrain is similar to Lasdun:To call an American writer a master of the short story can be taken at best as faint praise, or at worst as an insult, akin to singling out an ambitious novelist’s journalism — or, God forbid, criticism — as her most notable accomplishment. The short story often looks like a minor or even vestigial literary form, redolent of M.F.A.-mill make-work and artistic caution. A good story may survive as classroom fodder or be appreciated as an interesting exercise, an étude rather than a sonata or a symphony. A young writer who turns up at the office of an editor or literary agent with a volume of stories is all but guaranteed a chilly, pitying welcome.However, it is time for a rethink:

For six straight years, I’ve run in the Rocky Raccoon 100-mile trail run. It’s not just because it’s a well-run event, (which it is). I do it because it has also been a good barometer for me, to gauge the effectiveness of my Winter training. And it’s a great way to start out the new year right, in an “Ultra” sort of way.
And that brings me to the long list of blogs I want to follow, not to mention the many books and magazines that are calling my name. This is one area in which I must narrow my focus. With my many interests, there is no shortage of reading material. However, I have to accept the fact I’ll never read everything I want to.
Various people had things to say about that, and a lot of people wrote to the magazine expressing their views. I get the feeling many used impolite language. His followup/defense was basically "Physical conditioning is important for special ops, so anybody applying has to pass the basic-level tests, and that's what I meant(obviously)." Bullcrap, and- as I recall- phrased in a very 'If you were smart enough to understand' manner.

Mellow keyboards tinkle on Prayer, which has something of a Christmas atmosphere. The guitar lone and bluesy, and very melodic. There For that it is a bit too careful. But the semblance is there. All in all, a bit too obvious, although the guitar and keys can sound quite dissonant and wayward at times. The pace goes up a bit but it stays a bouncy affair. The keyboards sizzle towards the end.

#87-88: Tuba Museum. Every time I drive from home to East Lansing, I pass this quirky little place that is a tuba museum / restaurant hybrid. And obviously, the Travelers Club International Restaurant and Tuba Museum is known for its middle eastern cuisine. So, my parents visited me and we ate there. I tried babaganoosh for the first time (only known to me as “the name they use in every episode of MXC”) and a bison burger — THAT was incredible! Although the place was run by hippies, and the bathrooms were in terrible condition, I think I’ll go back because it’s just weird enough to work.
But, as the second test rolled around, the students who had studied little studied even less and the ones who had studied hard decided that since they couldn’t make an A, they also studied less. The second Test average was a D.
The first was suggested by a friend: A living willow fence. Not only did he offer the idea, he also offered willow. That is, he lent me his secateurs and showed me where a lot of willow was growing in his garden.

This spring when the weather gets warmer and the local chicken swaps begin we will be on the lookout for more additions to our flock. We’ve decided to go with older hens this time as opposed to chicks because we are desperate not to have to go through that whole rooster ordeal again.

Late Victorian and Edwardian Station Masters are perceived to have been highly respected individuals. They commanded the stations at which they were based, and were pillars of the community; respectable, authoritarian and honourable. However, in the case of station masters before 1870 these attributes are not necessarily applicable. Without established promotional trees, standardised rules and regulations, and with vetting procedures for new employees not being set in stone, Britain’s pioneer station masters were a very mixed bag, to say the least.

I'm off to LA this weekend for Disneyland for the first time. Yup, my first time ever after 9 years living in CA. I know, I know... but for some reason I've never had the urge or passion to go. I'm never been a fan of disney, cartoon, or deathly roller coaster ride anyways. While all of my other friends are super excited about the Disney, I'm a lot more excited of eating good food :), so we'll see if I can bring the kid in me this weekend. Have a good weekend and see you all next week!

Mysterious Innsmouth is dedicated to the history of the coastal town, presenting the reader with both the known history—what the general population knows about Innsmouth—as well as the secret history of the town. As always with CoC, the secret history is far more interesting, but there is little here that will surprise anyone who has read Lovecraft’s tale. A chronology of important events organized by year is also included for quick reference, as is a sidebar that introduces the Innsmouth Lore skill and twenty-five rumors (both true and false) about the town.
I don't like to think of myself as a food snob -- I mean really, I will eat ANYTHING -- but I do have strong opinions when it comes to food, along with some weird prejudices. On the subject of granola, I don't like it too clumpy or too sweet, I prefer crispy to crunchy, and I refuse to put flavoring extracts in my granola. I don't know why; that's just how it is with me. This particular recipe makes a dry, not very sweet, delicately flavored granola, which is just how I like it. Please see the notes at the bottom of the recipe for ingredient explanations and possible substitutions if dry, not terribly sweet granola isn't your bag.

This was a fine, mature and savoury take on Piemonte’s grape, like Petit Verdot it is a real mystery as to why this grape does so well in Virginia. Nebbiolo is a very late ripening grape that was pretty tricky to get right in Italy until well into the twentieth century. That being said I have only encountered it on 2 sites in Virginia, so perhaps it enjoys localised conditions.

The key is to give yourself the time to write. “Not that the story need be long, but it will take a long while to make it short.” – Henry David Thoreau. To write something short and witty that still tells the tale, that’s what takes the most time, but it’s well worth it. Try to write a show description in 25 words (an upcoming concert or movie). It’s a great training field to have you start thinking about not just what adjectives you could use but instead what three words can make a real impression on who the artist is.
If I’m completely real, which I guess is all I know how to be, since I’ve never been great at pretending, I have no idea what is going to happen. And the adventurer in me is ready for it, but the rest of me is not.

(1)“Adler isn’t respected by philosophers!” Well, the philosophers you read must never have mentioned in their worthless tomes that popularity doesn’t equal truth. All that matters is if the argument is a reasoned one and conclusion is true or not. If every philosophy professor in the world said Adler (and by extension Aristotle and Aquinas, since Adler is more about reiterating the correct philosophies of others and adapting them to modern issues than coming up with his own ideas) was an idiot, it still wouldn’t prove that he was wrong, only truth and reason would do that. (Now please don’t think that I think everything Adler said is true, he’s human, he’s wrong sometimes, but when compared to Descartes, Hume, Berkley, Foucault, Satre, James, Kierkegaard, Leibniz, Marx…you get the idea, he’s on a far more solid grounding of reason.)

As you know I'm unemployed and yet my day is spent educating myself, reading and researching, yet I receive Job Seekers Allowance, a pitiful income to live on, although I live a very frugal life and yet researchers, in the msm are paid a good wage, doing exactly what I do, well not exactly, as they just provide rubbish for the masses on some nondescript, unimportant subject. Because I am not paying taxes directly on my income (I do pay tax if I buy food, drink, clothes etc) I am looked upon by society as a scrounger?? Because I am not funding the illegal attacks on foreign lands, the setting up of military bases around the world, the enforcement of democracy (control of a country through banking debt), the upkeep of the Royal family and giving bankers, politicians and corporation owners a wage, I am looked upon as a scrounger?

Chilaquiles (chee-lah-key-les) are small, corn chip sized pieces of corn tortillas that are lightly fried and served with a chile sauce and cheese.

The underlying theme in his work as I see it, especially Hitch Hikers is that everyone is insane. Everyone is out of order, with their own chaotic agendas, their own insecurities and their own erroneous beliefs that they follow. Arthur Dent represents us, everyman, an ordinary person swept up in something bigger and stranger than he can imagine and yet he’s fundamentally a part of the weirdness. There’s something compelling about this proposal because deep down we know it to be true.

Just a week ago, I saw Ingrid crossing a street in Rome to avoid meeting me. She is now 48 and still looks lovely; I could vividly remember her coming through a door thirty years ago. As vivid as yesterday. The past is not the past; it is still living today, travelling with you in your memory.

“… cannot answer definitely most of the key macro-economic questions that concern society…. The world economy is a ship speeding through uncharted waters strewn with dangerous shoals.

His music is poetically written and he is a genius at sending a message with his words. If we could all express ourselves this well the world would be at peace and they would figure out how to make chocolate flavoured spinach. Some songs make me want to jump up on a podium for a cause and change the world, while others make me want to go hug everyone I see and tell them how wonderful I think they are. There are a few which make me want to purchase a sniper rifle and hide out in a bunker waiting for my ex to walk by... but they are few. There are LOTS that make me evaluate my life, for better or worse. Even if you are not interested in his soft, smokey voice (his voice is a synonym for sex), you have to appreciate the message in the songs. Plus, if you aren't tapping your foot or doing some sort of head bob by the end of the song you have no rhythm and something is broken inside you.

That’s Michael Shermer, and he’s definitely using the second method to do it. He’s a skeptic, and he openly admits that he’s doing tricks. But he makes it look pretty good, doesn’t he? If he were to tell you he was using psychic powers, you wouldn’t have to be a complete idiot to believe him. It certainly doesn’t look like he’s just bending things with his hands, at any rate. It looks a lot like things look when people claim to be using the first method, and demonstrating real paranormal abilities.

Over the years, if there's been a consistent complaint about Woodland Park's outdoor facilities, other than the overall size of our space (which has been corrected by our recent move to the center of the universe) it's been something along the lines of, "But where do the kids climb?" This has been especially true since the spring of 2010 when we, as a community, rethought what we wanted from our outdoor space, electing to move in the direction of what could be described as a "loose parts," or "adventure," or "naturalistic" model. We've made a conscious effort to stop referring to it as a playground, and instead reframe our outdoor experiences as taking place in a constantly evolving "outdoor classroom."

When I bought the book I thought it was a novella. I wasn’t disappointed to find out that it wasn’t because it’s far more than a record of events. It is quite correctly described as a meditation; one where its author comes to the same conclusion that many writers have come to before him, myself included, that words aren’t the answer but they’re all we have left to us. The most profound chapter is actually quoted in full on the book’s cover:

And what brought him to Limoux? He looked at about 40 estates between there and Italy. Provence appealed, but then he realised he would be too dependent on the tourist trade. He loves Burgundy, but he certainly couldn’t afford a vineyard in Burgundy, and the terroir in Limoux is great for the grape varieties of Burgundy. So he bought 22 hectares, pulled six and planted seven, and now has 29 hectares in production. He concentrates on Chardonnay, but has also played with Sauvignon and Chenin blanc, and made his first vintage of Pinot Noir in 2010, having in 2006, planted both Burgundian and champagne clones.

Riding in a van from Managua to Granada in the dark, we passed open trucks full of people and kids and teenagers playing on the street. In broad daylight, the brightly painted homes revealed themselves next to rundown shacks. We spent an afternoon at a local after school project, and made our way down dirt roads bearing gifts of empanadas and white boards. The educator in me flared up and I found myself wishing I could distribute sustainable change like candy, drowning the Savior complex in the rain barrels outside the door.
They are so versatile that you can use your leftover chicken, meat, veggies or even fruit preserve as their filling. Hand pies can be make well in advance and stored in the freezer.
Then there’s the guy who stands by the truck as it dumps its load at the landfill. I know he’s a pervert. In a sea of brown rotten food and broken electronics my beloved toys would surely stand out. Pinks and flesh tones decorated with rows of pearls and beads. Shiny, chrome bullets and oblong spheres glistening in the sun against unloved filth. All of them, banded together just like Blanky, Radio and the Brave Little Toaster. Damn, I’m sure sorry about that children’s movie reference. But if you’ve seen it, your imagination can now replace these friends with assorted dildos. I think I have kept my baby blanket this long for fear that it wouldn’t have a friend like the Brave Little Toaster to bail him out.

I am a Southern California girl and a stranger to the storms of the east coast, but when my dear friend's moved away I just had to go for a visit, not realizing, I probably should have chosen a different time of year to visit. Anyway the night I arrived they had one of the biggest storms of the season and I could see lightning ricocheting from the airplane. Whew! I was sure happy when I landed and was greeted by my friends.

It takes time to gain traction, another author assured us. People who are earning thousands of dollars on their backlist titles are 1) not earning that overnight and 2) are earning it across many multiples of titles. Expect to hit the Amazon charts at a rank of 300,000 to 600,000 and stay there for a month or more then slowly work your way up. In fact, be prepared for it to take 6 months, 12 months, as much as 18 months to gain traction. It’s a slow but steady build.
Listeria monocytogenes bacteria is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Healthy persons infected with Listeria monocytogenes bacteria often experience fever, severe headaches, stiffness, diarrhea, nausea and abdominal pain.

The characters. One of the many things I love about reading is meeting different kinds of characters--most of them I tend to love and and some are so remarkable that I can't seem to get them out of my system anymore. I so love Daemon Black. Who wouldn't love such a guy. The sarcasm, the wit, the confidence, no to mention being so hot and sexy and drop dead gorgeous. And he's an alien--sexy (jerk), everyday swoon-worthy (punch-worthy) alien with striking green eyes and kissable lips... What's not to love? And I bet you would love to meet Katy. She's an avid reader and a book blogger too! This girl cannot be tamed, and even Daemon with his killer ego and top-of-the-line sarcasm couldn't break her. The harder Daemon pushed, the harder she pushed back. She's strong and she knows how to bounce back. She's smart and definitely a kick-ass.

I am nearly up to the armholes but I have been knitting things in between instead which still are not properly sewn up or had buttons added. I am also still using my mum's laptop at the moment and have not decided as yet what to do with mine, whether to get it rebuilt with a larger screen or just buy a laptop and hope that does everything I want it to do. Lachlan keeps advising me about different things but I think it is more for his convenience than my own, lol! If you have any ideas please let me know as I really have had the one computer for nearly 8 years now so advice would be very welcome.
I might have commented before on the irony of the government the UK has but didn't vote for massively cutting the defence budget a few months ago, during two ongoing wars, Iraq and Afghanistan, and about to launch a third, that oh-so-successful instalation of civilisation and democracy in Libya.

I learned that the story of the Grotto began just before the start of the twentieth century, when a young boy learned that his mother lay near death after giving birth to a daughter. The story narrated that in tears the boy ran to the little parish church where he prayed for his mother’s life, promising that if she were spared he would one day undertake a great work for the church. His mother survived and the future Father Ambrose Mayer never forgot his promise.

Those I’ve had before, including Gageleer and Dupont Cervesia, are recreations of the pre-hop era of brewing in Europe’s Middle Ages. If nothing else, those beers show you why hops supplanted bog myrtle and other herbs in brewing.

This is the lie: that Jeremy Hunt has gone above and beyond the call of duty by seeking advice from OFT/Ofcom at every step of the way, publishing all this advice and following it at every juncture.
If you look at other writing, characters and settings are described once, maybe twice in one book. We really don’t have to read it on every other page. REALLY, we don’t. Reminding the reader of something as trivial as appearance insults their attention span. If you want to convey that the character is beautiful, PROVE IT. Show it through their interactions with other people and DEMONSTRATE attractive qualities.
So I am very thankful for my beads. And for my husband who understands why I stay up all night working and playing with my beads!
Honorable Mention:
Before we hit the field, each research project goes up before NHS death panel-like bureaucrats who assess whether it will die/be cruelly amputated/allowed to struggle onwards towards the light. This committee also rigorously probes the project’s morality (although admittedly they do seem unhealthily fond of making mice innards luminous). This makes sense: anthropologists—who in any case tend to be ethically sensitive types, innately prone to outbreaks of fruitarianism and adopting street puppies—have traditionally worked with vulnerable subjects, seen as requiring protection and empowerment.

It's a good thing I started this blog design thing because I have been able to stay up easily working on different things. (If you haven't checked it out yet, please do! I'm still offering a 20% discount! And if you don't want a new design, tell your friends!) CC thought I should have a "police" related blog background, so, I just did this new one this evening. I like it! I thought it was a nice change, and I guess it does need to be somewhat "police" related!

The fifth Marquess of Salisbury wrote to Viscount Swinton in 1954: “I should not be satisfied with the legislation which you suggest. I feel that it would only be tinkering with what is really becoming a fundamental problem for us all, though it is only beginning to push its ugly head above the surface of politics. The figures which we have been given make it clear that we are faced with a problem which, though at present it may be only a cloud the size of a man’s hand, may easily come to fill the whole political horizon …With each year that passes, and with the general improvement with methods of transportation, the flow increases. Indeed, if something is not done to check it now, I should not be at all surprised if the problem became quite unmanageable in twenty or thirty-years time. We might well be faced with very much the same type of appalling issue that is now causing such great difficulties for the United States.”
I like a good malty Oktoberfest Lager. I did my best to brew an oktoberfest ale for my wedding, it wasn't the same, but it was good. For the pure German in you, you can drink some Spaten or Paulander- easier to find German Oktoberfest beers. For the domestic side, I enjoy Flying Dog Dogtoberfest and Sam Adam's Oktoberfest.
CeeCee's life with her mother reads as a gritty portrayal of what it is like to live with a mentally unbalanced parental figure, her life in Georgia reads more like a fairy tale, a young girl's fantasy escape story writ large. Life in 1970s Georgia isn't perfect, and the racial issues of the time do make an appearance, but more as side concerns to the main storyline. While some may find this optimistic turn of events to be problematically unrealistic, I personally found it fitting. After the brutality of CeeCee's life in Ohio, the magic of Savannah was welcome relief and an utterly charming place within which to spend some time. This novel achieves a balanced mix of opening pathways into conversations about the serious issue of mental illness while at the

But guess what, you never see this reaction when a state by popular vote or by legislative vote expands the equality of same-sex couples or even votes in gay marriage. Because that is the will of the people, not legislation from the bench.

*Ending practice: We practice endings such as "ed" "ing" and "ies" in words like played, hopping and puppies. Since we were slightly limited on resources, we practiced these types of words with magnets, letter cards, magic "finger" writing in the air, on the whiteboard, and with chalk.

I appeal to you to share this email with everyone youknow, love, or care about. It is a matter of life and death of the planet and for you.

What I found to be one of the key points within the book was how there was a rich history with both the legend, and the town's residents whom for generations have protected the secrets that lie within the borders of their secluded, wooded town. I liked that the wolf lore in this story comes from the Fenrir lore, and even the Fenner Family in this story pay tribute to that. I enjoyed finding those secrets with Katelyn and at a point I just couldn't believe how so much vibrant and even destructive history could be kept in the dark.

“Opening your eyes is all that is needing. The heart lies and the head plays tricks with us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in that way knowing the truth.”

Here comes the low-down:
Houndshill is reported to have been sold for GBP £100m (€112m) and the Independent says that the property is subject to a loan originally from Anglo said to have been €140m though it is unclear if there is accumulated interest on top now. NAMA is said to have acquired the loan at “a substantial discount”. Modus is understood to have substantial loans from Bank of Ireland also – according to the Manchester Evening News in 2008 “the deal [GBP £100m financing of 40 retail units], one of the largest seen since the credit crunch began to bite, is a positive sign that the banks are starting to fund major deals once more.”

We had a stupendous time at the Monterey Bay Aquarium yesterday, but unfortunately, my pictures are not what I hoped. I think this has to do with the 6-21 inch Plexiglas in the tanks, the sometimes murky water, the low light, and most of all, operator error (I know about shutter speed, it just eluded me for the day).

It’s true when they say that in order to get better at something, you must know somebody who is better at it than you. Dave is a much better conversationalist than I am, among other things (not getting too low on myself here). I noticed in myself that I have a habit of interrupting when the other person is telling something, because I think that I have something so interesting that must be said. I need to learn to hold my tongue for these moments, until it is truly time for it to transition into my words. This comes naturally, or at least should, and does for the less dull or incompetent conversation (whatever that means).

The majority of the refugees in the Chapel Hill area are Karen Burmese, who were driven out of their country into squalid, overpopulated camps on the border of Thailand. Since 2005, the U.S. has allowed the influx of about 2,000 Burmese refugees annually, and the children arriving in Chapel Hill often speak no English, have little formal schooling, and have suffered major trauma.

For the writer, every encounter triggers a memory of an upbringing as the son of Donnie Barker, a chip-shop owner. The quality of his language makes his sense of place vivid. But he wants to know how that sense can survive the repeated process of re-appropriation a village undergoes. Once Hebden had only its "established": the surnames in its school were Barker, Greenwood, Sutcliffe, Ashworth. Then came the "offcomers", or outsiders. Affluence was a source of suspicion, not race. Now there are the new offcomers, arousing suspicions among the original invaders because they only view Hebden as a place to commute from. Barker lets the journey take him where it will, a meandering underpinned by some very incisive journalism. No assumptions: he seeks out the villagers who can help. His story of a Hebden soldier son, Edmund Ashworth, from a family album photograph though the trenches of Flanders to a lichen-encrusted memorial stone at the Talana Farm cemetery near Ypres is especially vivid. The Calder Valley was always rather forbidding for Hughes. "Blackness was a building blocking the moors, darkening the sun of every day," he wrote of Mytholmroyd's Mount Zion Methodist Chapel. During an adolescence spent "trying to detach myself from Yorkshire," Barker seems to have felt much the same. But in his story of one village – which might be any village in these times of change – he takes us to a very rich place indeed.

I think within his final paragraphs you’ll find the same gist Urquico has in her entire essay. Except Ms. Urquico’s will leave all bookish-women feeling warm and fuzzy and Mr. Warnke still comes off a bit burned.

I no longer feel like trash that has been thrown out because he has shown me that I am lovable to a man. I have also survived on my own and shown myself I am worthy. I take care of my home alone and I manage to parent my children with love and discipline. My son’s status last night on Facebook said, “I love my life.” I take partial credit for that attitude he has.

Hopefully I'll be getting more productive. I am having car trouble and we're looking at purchasing our 3rd Buick LeSabre soon. We are looking at a 2002 with 165,000 miles. Right now we have a 1998 with 254,000 miles and it's acting up. (We had a 1987 before our current car with 225,000 when we sold it.) We've scanned the car on the computer but nothing is showing why the car stalls or shudders. But anyway, hopefully the guy who has the 2002 (for $2000 plus our current car) can get the title straightened out and we can get this deal done! We don't plan on fixing this 1998 unless it's an easy fix (once we figure out what the problem is).

For everyone who doesn't understand the Aspie kid - Be patient. Remember that kids and adolescents with Aspergers are relatively immature, socially and emotionally, compared to non-Aspergers kids of the same chronological age. Imagine sending a 10 year old off to high school (even if she has a chronological age of 14), or putting a 14 year old boy behind the wheel of a car (even if he has a chronological age of 18)—or sending that 14 year old off to college or the army. We need to adjust our expectations for adolescents with Aspergers —and make sure they still have appropriate supports.

Jiger is a pretty intense enemy. She was able to take down Gamera in the past! That’s a pretty great feat when you think about it. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that she’s the strongest being in all of media. There are none who can stop her. Even if they do attack her she can take a lot of punishment. She hasn’t gotten this on attack power alone. One day Jiger will rise to the top of the blog ranks and show the world her true power. None will be able to stop her once that happens!
My Parppadelle was good, tho I twice doused it with tobasco to give it some flavor. And the Broccoli dish was blander, the flavors no pairing – they’d almost be better as separate side dishes.

So I have a habit of becoming a tad bit obsessive about "my things". Lately I can't seem to get enough SCAL time, and this recent event was no exception. I watched the video SvgCuts posted on their website that explained the feature "trace image". So I went on a quest to find .Jpg's with the right look for "tracing". What I looked for are essentially silhouettes of some of the magnificent trees that we saw on our roadtrip up to the Coastal Redwoods.(FYI- My favorite place was Prairie Creek Redwood State Park, and the Newton B Drury Scenic parkway & drive, Fern Canyon Trail, seriously Heaven on Earth) I thought the large trees were probably more SVG worthy than the toilet we saw decorating the lawn of those "resourceful and creative" people. Nor would I even think of Tracing Paul Bunyan's blue ox Babe in all his "bullish" glory....well maybe...another time I will share "love".

In old England, towns were given royal charters to hold faire on certain holidays such as Saint's Days. These were festive occasions at which much business was done and much merriment was made. They were the social and commercial highlight of the year when people were able to obtain goods they might not otherwise have had available to them and gather together to celebrate in fellowship. The local alehouses shut their doors and moved their operations to the faire, and some laws were relaxed for the duration.
The beauty of this place doesn’t fill you with a great and terrible awe, like a towering mountain might, or a great stormy sea. Instead, it is a peace that filters in and roots itself in your soul. It is a horizon that encompasses the entire circumference of your vision, and extends as far as the eye can see. Once your eyes are opened, you begin to realize that calling this place the Heartland has to do with much more than just its central location.
The biggest issue my Year 11′s have is that I’m not interested in the “yard of work”. They want me to tell them do Ex 3B Questions 1 to 7 left hand side. This is what they’re used to, they will then have something to aim for and they will have pages of worked questions (or hastily copied answers) to which they can point and say “Look, I’ve done my work” (or not as the case may be).

We missed the announcement of which beer had won the Champion Beer of Britain as it started off with some MP droning on which isn't really my thing, and then the Betty Stoggs marching band started up again which meant we couldn't hear anything except drums anyway. I was pleased when I found out later that Mighty Oak Oscar Wilde Mild had won. This means I'm ahead of the curve as far as beer nerdery goes, because thanks to a recommendation from young Rob I'd sought it out last year and been suitably impressed. So impressed I'd even bought a half this year before it was announced it had won.

A friend mentioned that when she put the ramekins under the grill, the custard started cooking further, which is not a good sign. Its because the grill is not hot enough to caramelise the sugar fast. Its for that reason that I preheat the grill and first try with one ramekin to check if temperatures are right (if you notice the pics, one of the dishes have a lighter brown colour and you can even see traces of caster sugar). If you feel that the rack is not really close to the grill, place an inverted baking dish on the rack and the ramekin on top of that. Be extremely careful while removing the dishes.

The train began to move again. The three passengers of the train did not look at each other. They did not speak. They simply sat quietly as the car rattled along.

If the amount of money consumers spend on hair care products annually is any indication, most people are concerned about the appearance of their hair and strive to attain beautiful, healthy and stylish locks. In fact, most will go to any lengths to achieve their desired look. From professional salon treatments to over-the-counter serums, hair care is a big business.
8-10ish Mark Plays in his play room, sometimes independently sometimes with me. Often I get our chapter of reading in for the day here, or if we have play group or are going to the store we leave around 9:30 (I also run upstairs to get dressed for the day in this window).
The angel told her, "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God." Mary seems confident and resolved when she responds, "I am the Lord's servant. May your word to me be fulfilled."
Now that I live alone, though; now that I’ve reached a plateau, I find myself asking these guys for help many times a day; when shaving in the morning or when brushing at night. Once, there was even a women! Imagine that, a female version of me. She grew her hair to neck length and lingered in front of the mirror to brush the rouge on her cheeks, fuller than my own, and brush the hair she’d cultivated. I began the conversation hushed out of reverence, and she replied low in turn. She told me that although she could see her reflections just as I could, she had never seen a male of her before. She called me handsome and I called her beautiful and we flirted until the point that I had to reach towards her face, but it was cold, cold glass and she didn’t even raise her hand in turn but left out of guilt and I never saw her again. I cried for the first time in years afterwards, cried pathetically until I fell asleep, like I used to do a s a child. What’s worse is that the other reflections don’t believe it happened. I stopped speaking of it once a certain married reflection made too many self-love jokes at my expense.
The Equatorial sun was brilliant and harsh; I once lay directly beneath a large fallen tree trunk, desperate for the tiniest sliver of shade. Insects whirred and bit. The water was filled with all sorts of dangerous things that could burrow into our flesh or bloodstream.

‘The American presidential election is dividing foreign investors and those based in the U.S., where Romney is favored across the board. U.S. investors choose the Republican candidate as best for the global economy by more than 2-to-1. Respondents outside the U.S. prefer Democrat Obama by almost 3-to-1 in the poll, conducted May 8′.
I stopped at the garden. There were snapdragon flowers there. In full bloom. Yellow, orange, white and red. The flowers were a shocking splash of color against the stark color of the building and its parking lot, and sidewalks. All black, and gray, and silver. Chrome, and steel, and glass. And in the midst of all that professional styling, and color, there they were. Those snapdragon flowers. Sticking out like some guy in a tie died t-shirt in a business meeting.
A: I like to read in all genres of fiction, adult and YA, as well as nonfiction and poetry. As a reader, it’s just more interesting to read around. As a writer, it keeps me from getting tunnel-vision if I read outside my genre, and the diversity helps me improve my writing skills. Right now, I’m catching up on Lee Child’s Jack Reacher series and I’ll be starting Toni Morrison’s new book. Upcoming YA books I want to check out include Angela Johnson’s A Certain October, Kekla Magoon’s 37 Things I Love, and Malin Alegria’s Crossing the Line. So many books, so little time.

Hubs had ordered the sea bass for his dinner, grilled in cooking style. This 10 oz. piece of fish looked much bigger than we both imagined (and it warmed up great the next day for the two of us to split I might add). It doesn’t look like the classically grilled piece of fish we both imagined. We believe it was cooked in their infra-red broiler like their steaks. Despite this dish being bland in presentation color (that was due to the side items hubs selected), the fish wasn’t even close to being bland in flavor. It was cooked perfectly and had such moisture locked in the slightly crunch crust. It was a really great piece of fish, leaving us both wondering when the last time was that we had fish that great. He had also ordered it Oscar style. The subtle sweetness of the lump crab was great with the creamy richness of the hollandaise. The best bite included the fish, crab, risotto and hollandaise. His two sides were a potato au gratin (will explain later) and a Parmesan risotto. The risotto was a little too creamy for me (I know, it’s cheese risotto) and monotone in flavor. But hubs really enjoyed it and thought I was crazy for thinking that. I personally think I just wasn’t in the mood for risotto, because the next day it tasted pretty good as leftovers.

My son had a ton of his things in the guest bedroom and I used it for a lot of storage, so clearing that all out is still a chore. I did grab this huge hurricane that I have had for years and decided to use it on the coffee table again. Such a neat piece. Yes, that's a peak at the new sofa, I just havn't had time to fluff, so no pics yet.
i love using vintage items in kids spaces. i think add a sense of history and charm. plus, vintage stuff is already all dinged up, so when the kids ding it up even more, it just adds to it's "character".

The demand for foreign companies, particularly miners, to transfer a 51 percent stake in local operations to black investors is widely seen as a tactic by Mugabe’s ZANU-PF party to raise cash for elections that may come this year.
My next couple of Environmental Wednesday posts will be centering on one main topic: transportation. More specifically, how to effeciently get around around without the use of your car. Your car eats money faster than just about anything else you own. This includes gas, maintenance, tickets, insurance, etc. The fact is, the more you drive your car: the more gas you pay for, the more maintenance is needed, and the sooner you need a new car which is even more money!
Domesticated, owned and kept, yet still free? Why not. We’re all a bit domesticated in these times, behind every boss is another boss and those who think themselves truly free are either wrong, or no-good hippies. The thing that goats have mastered is how to find liberty in shackles. You can tie a goat to the roof of a bus or you can throw one in the hold underneath. The only uncertainty for them: will I be eating chassis or roof-rack. In both outcomes, fate will decide if your canvas backpack becomes a delicate digestif. Moreover, they are not wasting time in the pursuit of advancement. It is not a priority, for a goat, to ensure it leaves the world a better place for its kids. They’d like to, as much as you and I would like to. But, their pragmatism leads them down a different path. They take hardships on the chin, make something out of nothing and out of a little, make more.

I also have a bit of business to take care of today. As we all know, I have been on something of a sabbatical from actually posting my photos to my blog and from keeping up with the blogs I follow. I am slowly trying, one by one, to go through those blogs – oh my, have I missed a lot – and during my catch up from Thursday night, I was happy to see on Day 188 of Pablo’s blog, that he has awarded me with “The Heart on Fire” award. If you have not caught up with Pablo’s work, make sure you check out my hotlink to his page – he is a huge talent. Thank you so very much, Pablo!

Naturally, I tuned into NPR this morning to confirm this fact. Fact confirmed. But it also prompted me to wonder if there's a linguistic term for how Ira Glass pronounces the letter l. Now for those of you familiar with Ira Glass, imagine him reading those last two words. Letter l. Can you hear it in your head? You know, Chris Christie has the same verbal quirk in case you need another point of reference.

I wish I could say “The Best Souvenirs Are Free” was totally my idea, but I have to give credit to my muse.³ My incredibly fickle and random muse put the idea in my head ten minutes before I was planning to leave the house for a writing session. My day shifted an entire hour so I could snap the picture, but I guess the rest is history. I owe her a big one, (Greeaaat). Extra muse juice, perhaps?

“Is that what you think we’re doing?” Kenneth rallied back, anger in his face. “Do you think that every battle has ended in suicide pacts? Williamson lost a lot of people in the battle against two invasion forces. So did the 12th Regiment! But neither committed suicide in the end! They all met their deaths bravely, but sometimes when you’re facing overwhelming odds and you have no other way out, suicide is preferable to spending a lifetime of torture and agony at the hands of your former comrades! Don’t you know what that’s like?”

I still hadn't made any soap by myself. We were getting low on soap and I didn't want to use the store bought stuff again. It makes my skin feel funny. The only solution was to bit the bullet and make it all by myself. There is a surprising amount of stuff you need to make soap. There are different oils, pots, blenders, additives if you like, and of course, the dreaded lye. I got it all and even decided to get the fancy wooden mold.

Of course, there's a rival girl and a cute guy. Anna (the nice/rival girl) is too cliche for me to relate and the cute guy (what was his name again? See, this is why I hate reviewing books months after I read them) was bland, nothing that stood out as a perfect match, to be honest.
The cause of the pain is sometimes difficult to determine but it generally originates from an organ in the chest area such as the heart, lung, esophagus or from the chest wall (skin, muscle or bone). Sometimes the gallbladder or stomach may cause referred pain that radiates to the chest.

Stop #1, Spiaggia, was incredible. It may have been the best meal I’ve ever eaten. I opted for Lamb Heart Risotto, and Emily went for Mushroom Ravioli. Both amazing choices, and when we opted for homemade gelato and chocolate cake for dessert, our taste buds were overwhelmed. Sadly, this place isn’t really the right spot for a camera (got the sense it would’ve been frowned upon because it’s so high-end and classy) but frankly, the food didn’t stay on our plates long enough for that anyways. Our dinner ran about $100 a person, but it was worth every penny.

I haven't really shared on my blog any of my weight loss journey. When I began this blog, I was at the same weight I am now. I do my best to maintain my weight, and if anything need to eat extra calories so I don't lose any! A couple of years ago, this would have sounded crazy to me.
JJ: Well, all writing is really hard for me. My editors could tell you some shameful stories…To the point of producing boils, y’know? But there have been a few things in my life that have come out in a trancelike state. ‘Violence of the Lambs’ was one. Strangely, the One Tree Hill piece was another; I was writing a totally separate essay for Joel Lovell at GQ—I can’t even remember what it was about—and we were sweating the deadline and everything, and suddenly late at night, one night, I started writing this other piece. Stupidly! But 48 hours later, it was done…It’s often dependent on whether I need money; how fast or slow it goes.
“Until his appointment as CIA director in 2009, Panetta co-chaired the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, which is the partner of Citizens for Global Solutions. Among its main recommendations is that the U.S. should put its oceans up for regulation to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.”
So, while breaking out of the prison some of our heroes get slashed into little pieces and fed to the zombies. But they somehow manage using the same tunnel the zombies have dug to get into the prison. They get to the Arcadia – just the two Redfields and Alice now – and discover that it is really just a trap built by Umbrella to get those last surviving humans to experiment on them. Seems the t-virus supervillain is not so super as Alice was since her blood and the t-virus bonded better than his blood does with the t-virus so now he needs her blood. Alice won’t give that up without a fight, naturally.
Once the phylactery had been sundered, King Kroma’s foul remains were wreathed in a white cleansing fire which purified the corrupted corpse of the dwarven lord–leaving behind shining armor and a white gleaming skeleton along with Kroma’s crown. Thane Fenris recovered the remains and crown to be ferried back to his clan, bequeathing Zantric with the dwarven lord’s armor and weapon in thanks.

The most blatant examples of client-sponsored Corporate Cultural Collusion involve account assignments.

In Texas, Quantrill was given further missions by the Confederate Army, including catching desserters and Commanches. They failed to catch the Commanches, and they brutally murdered more of the desserters than they brought in, so the Confederates were forced to station other soldiers to defend against the Raiders, their own men. General McCulloch arrested Quantrill on March 28, 1864, but he escaped and fled up to Missouri, joined by his men.
Even today, anyone who has been lucky enough to attend any of McCartney’s shows(this journalist will never forget seeing him some years back, playing in front of the Colosseum, in Rome) will tell you that he is the lead singer of the greatest Beatles cover band in the world, and he is their biggest fan. So, it seems curious, in that light, that he decided to pull the plug. But when we consider that Lennon had told his band mates, a few months earlier, of his own intention to leave the group, a decision that was kept from the public, it makes for a rather Machiavellian twist.

The temperature has fluctuated like a teenager’s hormones, but we’ve been blessed with three or four truly gorgeous days, with cornsilk sunlight and balmy temperatures of 65 or so. On one such lovely morning (Friday, actually), I found myself outside and enjoying it, as I had been contracted to take headshots for yet another Dept. of Dramatic Art undergrad in desperate need of a current photo for an upcoming audition. For those of you who don’t know, a headshot (in thespian terms) is a photo of an actor from the shoulders up, used by directors as a casting tool after auditions – to remember who was who, to put faces with names, to form plausible ‘families’ of people who sort of resemble each other, etc. They tend to look something like this:

These realizations, of course, haven't stopped me from trying to do my part in contributing to the relief effort underway in Haiti. So far, I've donated some money to UNICEF online, and now that it may be possible to be able to write off those donations as 2009 tax deductions, I will probably contribute more. Short of actually going into Haiti to help the relief effort in person, I feel like it's the least I can do.
As I reflect on the upcoming holiday, I can't help but think of the above verse. He 'laid down His life for me.' I can hardly comprehend this. He loves us so much that He would die for us.
On the side of this blog, I have linked to A Girl And Her Gun one of THE most succinct self-expressions about what it means to become a gun-owner and join this non-exclusive group of now just over 100,000,000 Americans, and who knows how many more life-loving, freedom-seeking individuals in other nations like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Central and South America, Europe and elsewhere.
I guess I am currently at the stage of life, where I feel that seriously there are so many things that I still have not achieved, have not accomplished. Life recently has also thought me that sometimes, yes, life can be so difficult with its own tears, sadness, disappointment, worriness, fears and everything that is just beyond your control nor your prediction.
The day after Cole and Qayte went to the library, they travelled to the local park, which was a magical land of wonder and joyness. And swings. Which they swung on. And a couple of really curse-filled thirteen year olds. Then they walked around, and talked about random stuff, and they whiled the day far far away. The day following that they decided productivity was the key, and so after another quick trip the park and a drive into Sunnyside Up for supplies, they proceeded to bake. The mixed them up some chocolate batter, and although Cole tried (and succeeded) to eat some of it that was left in the bowl, Qayte tried (and succeeded) to keep it away from her. Then they evened out the batter in its containers, so they were all the same height, which was harder than it sounds. They stuck it in the preheated oven then, and mixed them up some frosting. There was some trouble with a 'double boiler' and an argument over sour cream, which was added to the frosting according to the recipe, against Cole's better judgment, because sour cream is the devil. Then the frosting was carefully mixed, and tasted to make sure it wasn't poisonous. The baked goods were cooling, the frosting was ready, and Cole and Qayte got out their secret weapon. As soon as the baked goods were totally cooled (though Cole protested that they could be frosted before that point, Qayte would not LISTEN TO REASON) Cole and Qayte each frosted six of them, leaving about eight tons of frosting left over. A cake was suggested, to deal with the excess frosting. Then, frosted baked goods in hand - or rather, on counter - Qayte broke off a couple of pieces of white chocolate from the Ghiradelli bar they had purchased earlier, and she shaved the into curly strips with a cheese grater. Then they sprinkled white chocolate on the cupcakes, took some phototographs, and showed them off to those members of Qayte's family who were not in their rooms. Then they each ate one. They were freaking delicious.

Several limitations of this study are important to note. Given the data was collected online using social networking websites and list serves, these participants may represent a unique subgroup of transgender individuals. While individuals from urban, suburban, and rural areas throughout the country participated, most were white and reported higher levels of education than the general population.
♥ The weather here has been absolutely gorgeous (and totally unseasonable) here in Western PA! We’ve had nothing but sunshine and temperatures in the upper 60s and lower 70s for the past week! This trend looks to continue into the next two weeks, and I’m for sure not complaining about it! I can’t wait for Summer to get here :) We even had our first Thunderstorm last night. It was awesome. I don’t know about you, but I love Thunderstorms! This was also Paisley’s first Thunderstorm. She did surprisingly well…it didn’t seem to bother her too much.
I’ve never seen Forrest Gump. (I’ve also never seen The Wizard of Oz. How I’ve made all these years I’ll never know.) But Evening’s Empire reminds me of what I know about it through cultural osmosis. This is, as Bono puts it in a blurb on the back of the novel, “an alternative history of the sixties generation”. While Flanagan shies away from showing us the Ravons interacting with other great British rock-and-roll bands (for instance, Bowie is only mentioned in passing as a starstruck youth in a British club), the Ravons, through three very different careers, manage to hit almost every large event in rock-and-roll history—except Live Aid, which haunts Emerson to this day. While a lot of it just makes sense for a lesser known contemporary of the Beatles, I thought the Ravons’ success with technology was stretching it a bit; whenever the recording industry switches to a new format, the former Ravons manage to always get out ahead. But for the most part, Flanagan creates a very believable journey through the sixties to the aughts, with each decade retaining a distinctive—but not stereotypical—flavor.
Isa 59:19: So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard against him.
In Your Dog Is Your Mirror, dog trainer Kevin Behan proposes a radical new model for understanding canine behavior: a dog’s behavior and emotion, indeed its very cognition, are driven by our emotion. The dog doesn’t respond to what the owner thinks, says, or does; it responds to what the owner feels. And in this way, dogs can actually put people back in touch with their own emotions. Behan demonstrates that dogs and humans are connected more profoundly than has ever been imagined — by heart — and that this approach to dog cognition can help us understand many of dogs’ most inscrutable behaviors. This groundbreaking, provocative book opens the door to a whole new understanding between species, and perhaps a whole new understanding of ourselves.

We have been trying to by a sticker from each town we visit (sometimes we forget!) but so far we have not gotten around to putting them anywhere. Handy! Well they are not on the truck.

When I was in high school, I liked to wear bright red lipstick. I stopped after some girls put some quite hurtful messages in the school newspaper about me. I guess they thought I deserved it because I "stole" one of their boyfriends. Girls can be very cruel. You couldn't pay me to go back to being 18.
I found this to be one of the most fascinating books that I’ve read in a long time. A book that flows nicely, The Shipping News provides complex underlying themes by introducing small exerpts from the 1944 Ashley Book of Knots at the beginning of each chapter. As I entered into the final chapters, these reflections truly became relevant and contributed greatly to the success of the book. Set in the rich, always-changing, land/seascape of Newfoundland, I felt that in a very honest way, I finally had some inkling of what life has been for Newfoundlanders. Issues of overfishing, development, weather, economic struggle and family life were pieces of thread, knotted together into a very satisfying narrative. A VERY ’magical’ read!
Incidentally I only found out this week after a few rounds of email chat that Ian who runs Black Acre is also El-Eye from pioneering Bristolian Hip-hop crew Aspects. This revelation comes with news that they have a new album dropping pretty soon too. This is their latest single produced by Akira Kiteshi who was perhaps my first introduction to Black Acre.
As I have stated before, Islam is only a secondary infection, one that we could otherwise have had the strength to withstand. Cultural Marxism has weakened the West and made us ripe for a takeover. It is cultural AIDS, eating away at our immune system until it is too weak to resist Islamic infiltration attempts. It must be destroyed, before it destroys us all.

Of course, you have heard of all of the wealth that was stolen from so very many in earlier eras of your current history, but it must be understood that even those assets stolen were not enough to cover fully the building up of the United States, and funds were borrowed that were never returned in exchange for the building up of the United States and the spreading of such prosperity.

I tried to find out how I managed to get out alive from the clutches of those beasts but got no replies. I guess it is better this way, maybe for someone who must have dared to save me, for I had no strength left to carry on. I do say a silent prayer for that person for giving me another chance to live.”
I kept a redwood flower box planted with chives. I have had it for years as it just came up every year. We liked using it on our baked potatoes. For some reason the whole thing died out the last winter. I planted some new starts from another part of my garden and it is timidly taking off and growing. It will be a few years before that box fills up again. I will put fresh soil in it again this year to revive it's growing matter.

I am just moody, emotional, and I want HIM to buy me a damn present. Is that to much to ask for? He has never bought me a present on his own besides our first Christmas we had together as a married couple. It's just irritating, like he doesn't really know my likes/dislikes. Ha, here I go with the emotions. I am going to show some pics of his box that I made for our anniversary. I think it is the best box I have ever made!

As the American party were leaving Caher House around 4.30am for an early morning flight and my flight wasn't until 7.15pm on Sunday evening my luggage had accompanied us round Kerry and I was dropped off at the Bunratty Castle Hotel on the way back to Caher.
It seems like a contradiction of terms - what are plants for, if not to co-exist with wildlife?
Najib said the project signified a major leap into high technology defence acquisition, providing the impetus for the local industry to acquire cutting-edge technological knowledge and expertise.

NEW YEAR's PARTY!!!!
I’ve written before on my blog about Sporting Socialism and how the ideas of socialism in Football can breed an anti-competitive sport and this is a prime example. There are a number of clubs who provide the bulk of the interest abroad. The likes of Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool and to a lesser extent Chelsea and Manchester City have huge overseas support. Meaning no disrespect to Norwich City, but I doubt they have the same sort of support (or any) in Asia.
The sound of footsteps echoed in her mind and she cursed the other men for fleeing. They would pay for leaving her here to deal with this Venator.
Hell, here I'm never home and, when I am, I don't want to talk to you. I do have Google Voice and I have made calls via my computer, but what? You can't send me a loner flip phone or something to tide me over? WTF? And, let me point out this piece of crap was given to me by this company.
URI stated in a press release that its New Mexico feasibility studies are expected to be completed by the end of 2011. Assuming that the NRC license renewal moves forward in a timely manner, that appropriate financing is available and that there is a sustained recovery in the price of uranium, the company should be in a position to begin construction of the facilities in 2012 and begin mining in 2013.
Yay or Nay: NAY...just wasn't for me.
“Widow Jessup trained him up-right”, they would say. Jaxon heard this statement at least once a day, until the day he died. He had a reputation for being everything to all women. He didn’t yet understand why a woman would even look at him twice. Nevertheless, this degree in sexual pleasure helped him to find his way into nearly every pair of panties in the county. He had his pick of any girl on the Creek. And Jaxon definitely loved the ladies. There were times he enjoyed the attention from the girls on the Creek. But then again, there were times to just wore him out, trying to keep up with his pleasing reputation.
But you can always safeguard you.
Oh man. If only there was time for them all.

Speaking of silly- in that first picture, the little one is mocking me taking pictures of them. lol. See his little hands making his pretend camera? Little punk... ;)
Here's some pictures of the various fabrics the ladies used. Some got a away before I could take pictures. The variety was great!
Bottom Line: If you're on a budget, I think it's safe to skip this collection altogether (which is what I did). The bronzing powder and blush has an incredibly smooth texture but the shade was a muddy mess on me. I recommend trying it out in person before shelling out $75USD. The glosses are nice with Indigo Blue being the most unique out of the 3 if you feel like being adventurous. The meteorites goes on clear with visible shimmers like every other meteorite that was released in the past. If you must get something up from this collection, my picks would be the eyeshadow quad, the Khol Kajal Eyeliner, and any of the 3 collectors items with Emilio Pucci prints on them (for Pucci collectors).
FACT FIVE: My favourite quotations are:
In fact, the criticism of Roberts’ work extended even to the leadership of her former paper.
Even though looking our definite and impending death in the face gives us perspective it’s not the only thing.
It began with protests against President Obama’s “stimulus”, signed into law on February 17, 2009. The next day, CNBC’s Rick Santelli angrily called for tea party to protest what we now know was little more than a political slush fund and an a historic failure that did not reduce unemployment or jump-start the economy. It simply added to the trillions in debt Obama would heap upon this and future generations.
If you have been to CVS since Sunday, let us know if you received this coupon.
There is precedent here, Pol Pot found an ideal way to achieve equality in Red Cambodia; he just murdered anyone who differed from the norm.
Of.
As master and commander.
Afterwards, I caught Terry's talk. She was hilarious and nerdy as ever! I also went to the Publishing Panel. Everybody was lovely there. I found it really refreshing that nobody tried to sugarcoat it. They made writing and publishing very real to people. The last thing I saw before heading back home was the Opinionated Bloggers. For me, PPKers stole the show. Footface was charming and out-of-this-world hilarious. And Jordan was brutally honest and insightful.
I was having a drink at Bronwyn's leaving do — the latest of many and only the last of this year's — and it was depressing to realise looking around that nearly all the people in the room were historical footnotes, at best, as far as the Library Service was concerned. Including myself.
“Both of my parents were killed in an Orc raid upon my people,” Brulee said stiffly, from behind her. Creme’s breath caught in her throat. “I pray each night for their souls to be watched by the Light, as I do for my brother and ever other friend who has left this world and as I will do for your mother.” Creme watched as the Draenei’s hands tightened on the reigns. “Do not be so quick to judge the experiences of others, lest you also be judged by them.”
Recently, they've actually become one of the emails that I don't automatically send to the "trash" folder.
Regrouping in subtraction with three-digit numbers is also scaffolded more (the progression of the concept presentation is by smaller steps) (in 2-B). Regrouping with zero tens is still left for third grade (as in 506 − 358).
Jesus never became part of the world, for He knew His real home was with His Father in Heaven. Earth was merely a place He was passing through. He was given a job to do—to redeem mankind back to His Father, and at the end of that job He said, “It is finished.” He did not work in His own strength, on His own accord, by His own methods, or for His own gain.
So much to explore outside!
And he is right. Thankfully, we in America have not become so devout in our efforts to appease the gods of climate change, and legislatively, we are in an earlier stage of transition to these inefficient and costly "renewable" systems. We can only hope that the winds of change are blowing in 2012, and with them we can put an end to the crippling subsidization of "renewable" systems like wind power -- until such time that free-market innovations dictate that they can be a viable addition to our energy infrastructure.
At this point you can just let the mixture sit until it has doubled in bulk, which takes at least 1.5 hours but more like 2 (I like to have about 2-3 hours of total rising time for the loaf to have the right texture and flavor); or you can let it sit for 20 minutes and then let it rise. Follow the steps below for the two different methods. It’s a choose your own adventure for breadmaking…
Apple Moss @Overlay 75 % toned blue using a hue saturation adjustment and gently masked off jug and flowers.
Goddard says that this track went through several run-throughs before the final Strangeways LP version, with entire Moz verses being chopped out. This doesn't feature the "missing Moz" verse which was compensated for by Marr's solo over that section on the final LP version, but it does feature some unheard Mozwork with the title itself part of the lyric. If I read Goddard right, this take we have here would have been one of the very earliest ones.

I do set out with a plan. I call it a ‘skeleton outline’ because it is really just a guiding document, very short on detail. I guess I use it as a crutch to help me in those difficult first 30 pages or so. That’s the danger area, those 30 pages, the place where your ship can really run aground. But if I know I have the plot more or less worked out then that’s unlikely to happen.
Happy Valentines Day everyone! Hope everyone is having a lovely holiday. Unfortunately for me, Shawn and I didn't get to spend much time together today but we did get to celebrate Vday yesterday. We decided to have a laid back, no fuss holiday. We just wanted to spend quality time together so we decided to make dinner together. This never happens as I am the queen of the kitchen...

Like a Phoenix rising from the ashes, Charlie rises above being abused and used. With steely determination, she thrives in the care of an aunt and uncle she’s never known; but her guilt and need to connect with her mother and siblings bring her low at times.
For anyone, being sick is no day at the park, especially when there is a lot going on. I recall the times when I was working full-time and the biggest concern when I was sick was calling in for a conference call during my ailment. Big deal. For most stay-at-home-moms who are under the weather, it's a whole other level of patience, endurance, and will. It's like making dinner in a pressure cooker in a furnace... blind. You can't rest or take care of yourself because you are caring for your kids first.
The Countess of Rothes was the most distinguished of all the Titanic passengers, and the only one with a title. But when the ship sank, she stepped up to steer and row a lifeboat.
The second point that may be a stickler for some of you is their price. These figures are not the cheapest on the market. The SWAT Leader, Sergeant and Sniper cost $4.95 each. The SWAT Grunts are better value at $11.95 for all four figures. The Horrorclix Field Agent is, sadly, long out of production but can still be found on various on-line auction sites like e-Bay.
Hello! I hope that everyone enjoyed their holidays with family and friends...and of course, FOOD!! We had a very quiet Christmas which is how I like it! The advantage of living overseas away from your family (although has its disadvantages) is the lack of hectic traveling back and forth to everyone's home...and making sure you don't leave anyone out.
Another choice for your garden is to have a vegetable garden. These usually require a little more work and research than a flower garden, but can be much more rewarding. No matter what time of the year it is, you can usually find one vegetable that is still prospering. That way you can have your garden be giving you produce almost every day of the year! When starting a vegetable garden, you should build it with the thought in mind that you will be adding more types of veggies in later. This will help

The beginning is very similar to Kick-Ass in terms of story structure. Frank (Rainn Wilson), seemingly had no real prior exposure to super hero’s before watching an episode of the Holy Avenger (Nathan Fillion) as opposed to Kick Ass whose Mom died of a brain embolism or something something SCIENCE! Suddenly, Frank has a bee in his bonnet to stop crime and does so by dressing as the crimson bolt and beating people with a plumbers wrench. He goes out, posting signs telling “Crime” that he’s coming, much like Kick Ass made a…. what was it?…. *Googles Kick-Ass*…. WTF is MySpace? Whatever…. to advertise their badass-e-ness.
2 Samuel 24:10–And David’s heart condemned him after he had numbered the people. So David said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done; but now, I pray, O LORD, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”

But gleaming down the miracle mile
He knew who he was…an angel…a heavenly host, but he could not remember almost anything that had led up to his fall. It was a black spot in his mind except for an image that haunted him. It was of her…a girl. He knew he must know her but he could not remember her name or any connection they may have had.
1 Cor 5:2,5-7,13 (Phi) Are you still proud of yourselves? Shouldn’t you be overwhelmed with sorrow? The man who has done such a thing should certainly be expelled from your fellowship… the man should be left to the mercy of Satan so that while his body will experience the destructive powers of sin his spirit may yet be saved in the day of the Lord. Your pride in yourselves is lamentably out of place. Don’t you know that a little yeast can permeate the whole lump? Clear out every bit of the old yeast that you may be new unleavened bread!… It is your plain duty to expel this man from your fellowship!

As a country that is trying to modernize its economy and society, this fundamentalist mindset poses a unique challenge. Since the late 1970s, this faction of society has had immense decision-making power particularly in education and the courts — the two areas where interaction between the government and the average citizen is greatest. Three decades later, they have managed to make their ideology the foundation on which education and justice are based. Even appointing progressive ministers has failed to make any substantial change because from the bottom up, the system is sustained by people who have a religious conviction to resist change. Nothing is harder to shake than that type of conviction.
I won’t go into what that is (you can look it up yourself) except to say that when you tell guys about it they clutch themselves, double over & say “oh. my. gawd!” So I can’t blame him for being a little skittish about the unknown.
And I'm ready for it.
“What am I?” I asked.
I love my husband, and I love my marriage. What the fuck do I need to do to get past this?
Though Stowell conceives this as a traditional story ballet, there are no bravura phrases for the dancers, except for the performing jester, whose dazzling moves serve as “entertainment,” not a simile for any internal or external struggle/success. A dream interlude that shows the young Cinderella with her mother and father is the only segment that touches close to a feeling of loss; it’s too bad it is not reprised somehow during the transformation process when the godmother appears to prep her for the ball.
I have seen some Christmas trees and other little trees on ravelry, and they are often super cute, but they are miniatures. How cool would it be to have a life-size knitted tree? Beats my plastic one any day!
Now that is not to say he is perfect by any means, because none of us are. He is just perfect for me. And I certainly hope that he can say the same for me.
Chandler called into my radio show on Saturday morning, and talked about the planned land-grab at length. I went to shop at the Open-Air Market myself on Sunday (check out those fabulous cherry preserves and yummy cashew brittle!) and spoke with Chandler about the upcoming hearing, and then decided to attend it myself.
At 23 weeks we went back to the doctor to check the baby’s size. Almost immediately I knew something was wrong, again. The tech seemed very concerned and was not talking very much. I could see the measurements and she was now measuring almost 5 weeks behind. The tech told us that things just didn’t look right and that she was going to get the doctor. I was crying, my husband was quiet, we were scared. The doctor came in and told us that things did not look good, that he was going to get us an appointment with a specialist for the next day. That night my husband and I cried and cried. We had no idea what to expect. The next day we drove four hours to the specialist’s office where we finally got some answers. We were told that Stella had severe IUGR (Inter-uterine growth restriction). Most IUGR is caused by high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, drinking, or drug use. I did not fit into any of these categories. Healthy women’s babies usual develop IUGR because of some sort of chromosomal abnormalities, so I had to have an amnio. My doctor recommended hospital bedrest and very close monitoring. I was admitted to the hospital and I spent the next three weeks hooked up to monitors and getting ultrasounds three times a week. A few days after my amnio, the results came back that there were no chromosomal abnormalities. This meant that my IUGR was a total fluke and the severity was even weirder.
Beth said she needed to “de-frag” or “de-frog” or “de-something” the system to consolidate files and free up more storage capacity. I told her to go for it, as long as she wore one of those bomb suits like in The Hurt Locker in case shrapnel suddenly erupted from the keyboard. Or frogs.
Found two examples this past week of citizens using the POPS dataset. One is Foursquare user that has inputed the spaces with names on to the service and created a list of the spaces that other Foursquare users can follow. Good to see that 19 people are following the list (which appears to have been created in February), that suggests some interest in gaining awareness of POPS.
Of course, since I've had extra time to ruminate over choices, our cabinet color choice is now Cloud White, a slightly-warmer-yet-still-not-cream white from Benjamin Moore rather than the somewhat-too-stark Simply White. I've also found new pendants for the kitchen. We'll be going with these gorgeous pendants:

Having come from Cuba I had relatives who lived and died under a totalitarian regime, I grew up very attuned to the impact of ideology in people’s daily lives. One of the distinguishing characteristics of Stalinist era movies, for example, is that the protagonists all tend to die. What remains is “The State, The Revolution.” Stalin couldn’t have done a better job re-writing the Mass than Benedict XVI. The re-written Mass makes the churchgoer feel that he/she is part of something greater than him/herself, something to which he/she should be completely submissive and that will be here, long after he/she is gone and forgotten. Utopias, atheist or theist, are bigger than lives. Apparently that the Gospel is lost in the translation is a small price to pay for all that power and glory.
The more people you interact with, the more advice you get. They assume that your needs and means are the same as theirs’. They are also sure that you have less IQ than they do and are less informed than they are. Of course you want to a) save money b) go abroad c) want lots of company, houses, gold etc etc. Some people even yell at you, if you don’t take their wonderful advice.
A 20-something female journalism student took a different approach: “To me, it’s just a word. Though this is coming from someone who swears like a sailor… I understand why it is offensive to some people and that’s why I don’t say it in public…But, again, to me it’s just a word. But since it does offend people I think that should be taken into consideration that words offend people. Let’s just be nice and hug each other.”

One of the most popular free anti virus software is Grisoft's AVG anti virus software. This free anti virus software is as good as a free software can get. There are no hidden malware and neither does one have to pay anything for using it. The virus signature database can also be updated without paying a fee! Unfortunately, this free version is however, meant for personal and non-commercial use only.
"There's something else..." the coroner continues, "...the contents of the ziplock? Genetically altered and irradiated human material. Not sure what, but the DNA code is odd and the cellular structure shows two extra chromasomes. Never seen anything quite like it before. Oh one more thing...it's reproducing. There's 10oz of it now, I had to freeze it to stop it replicating."

So what’s a sports-lovin’ American like myself to do? Well, there’s always the option to not tune in. Last week a friend told me he doesn’t watch Sportscenter anymore simply because he can’t stand it, mostly for the reasons outlined here. I was blown away by the concept of not having Sportscenter in my life, undoubtedly the show I’ve tuned into five times as much as any other since I was about nine years old. Is it really possible to live a life without Sportscenter?
Since I don't have an apron die, I cut my own out of blue CS. When I added the gingham paper, I adhered it on the sides and the bottom, leaving a opening on the top for a pocket. Next I wanted to make the couple stand out so I adhered the couple to a label shape.I adhered the stamped image on the bottom half of the label and used pop dots on the top half of that stamped image.Next I just adhered the bottom half of the label to the gingham paper. Behind the label shape is the invitation information for the BBQ party,tucked right into that pocket. What a cute party invitation and it fits into an A-2 size envelope.
In school, everyone asked me if I’d converted yet, I told them not yet, but soon. When I returned home that night, I began the arduous process of taking out my fake hair. I’d been told that it wasn’t allowed and I wanted to enter my new religion starting out on the right foot.

March is one of my favorite months. To me, it's always been the beginning of spring. Here in Boston, it still feels like winter (except for the past few days but it was a bit of a fluke, a lovely fluke but a fluke nonetheless) but I don't care. March = Spring in my book.
Thanks for letting me vent yesterday. I am still so upset at AT&T. I think they are complete jerks now. I have been told bad story after bad story about them from people today. And every time I see a recital pic from my daughter come up on the computer screen, I worry if I'm making the right decision for her. Ugh. I hate major decisions. LOL I think once the switch is made and we both get to that point, things will be just fine. It's just the apprehension of wondering how she will react when her last lesson with this teacher comes and her first lesson with her new teacher and if she will pout or just go ahead and roll with the punches. So while I'm still a little stressed, I feel much better today overall.
The Alberta and federal governments have said the Oil sand pipeline is crucial to building new markets for the country’s resources. But environmental, aboriginal and social action groups say the risks of a pipeline rupture or oil tanker spill are too great. Money the root of all evil is evident here too..

Pours extremely hazed orange-copper, with a fluffy head letting convoluted aromas of rose hips, chamomile, granny smith apple, leather, and burlap sack. Flavors of wet hay, orange blossom water, lemongrass, petals, some wood, and a slice of hop bitterness towards the back – accumulating to a lingering body and light carbonation.
5). Justin Blackmon, WR to Jacksonville. I had Blackmon going to the Rams on the 6th pick. That was based on the assumption that Blackmon would be taken by the ”Jags” in the 9th spot. However, because they moved up to 5th, they did take Blackmon. No doubt, like the Rams, Jacksonville QB Gabbert needed another wide out to compliment Robinson. Blackmon should be able to fill the bill nicely.

The majority of crustaceans have the refracting eye structure. According to evolutionist assumptions, all the creatures within the class Crustacea should have evolved from the same ancestor. Therefore, evolutionists claim that refracting eye evolved from a refracting eye, which is far more common among the crustacea and of a fundamentally simpler design.
“I ask if there’s an actor whose career she particularly admires. Her answer is refreshingly offbeat. 'Robin Williams. I want a career like his! I want to be like Robin Williams, really. It’s all the different characters he does, all the different voices.’ What about actresses? 'You know whose career I really liked? Brittany Murphy. I thought she played quite interesting characters. She was in Girl Interrupted, and in 8 Mile she had this griminess to her, this edge, which I quite liked.’
Idiosyncrazies is a new Gallery/Gift Shop located in Point Pleasant, NJ that we hope to open by May 31, 2010.
Welcome to a new year. I don’t know about you, but 2011 was a tough one for our household and for many of my friends. When my husband and I sat down to look at the year in retrospect we realized we’re both tired.
Woodsy trails, old forest and the slight tang of salt in the air.
Early Valentines were much more elaborate. At the start of the 1800's, mechanical Valentines were in vogue. With a opening and closing or the pulling of a tab, the Valentines would come to life. These tended to be on the bigger side and would sometimes increase the cost of mailing. But boy were they interesting!
Like many of you, the art of early D&D played a crucial role in shaping my understanding of the game.
