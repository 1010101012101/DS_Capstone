Throughout her career, Kollwitz's themes were economic, political and familial but rarely sexual (violence is the leitmotif of the rape scene, not sex). That makes the inclusion of photographer Bruce Bellas' black-male odalisque seem gratuitous because its celebration of male beauty appears to be mostly an aesthetic statement about the absence of such imagery in art history. David Hockney's male-nude etchings from the 1960s, including a couple casually chatting in bed, are a better fit. His medium complements hers, and his normalization of then-taboo behavior was a political gesture as potent in its time as her antiwar imagery had been.

In the reporting for this story, not one coach or official I spoke to felt that the “cut list” was a good idea. They either didn’t use it at all or only used it when one-on-one conversations would be wildy impractical, such as when there are multiple rounds of tryouts.

We'd promise to stop harping on the 3-point shooting problem the Pirates seem to have at home, but the numbers are so ... bizarre. That number is the number of 3-pointers made-per-minute at the Prudential Center for Seton Hall. The Pirates have played 85 total minutes at home and connected on just three 3s. This team is too talented to keep that number up all season long, but right now the slump is looking bad. And worse — the next five games are all at home.

But unlike the work stoppage in the NFL, not nearly as many fans will care if the NBA loses a chunk of its season due to the lack of a collective bargaining agreement. The probability of an owner-initiated lockout dampened the usual enthusiasm of the draft lottery. First-year college players like North Carolina's Harrison Barnes, Kentucky's Terrence Jones and Baylor's Perry Jones who normally would have opted for the draft stayed in college because they suspect an interrupted season. Those decisions sucked any depth out of the top 10 that would have made the eighth overall pick valuable in previous years.

Before making an offer, determine whether bargaining is appropriate. It's bad shopping etiquette to make an offer for a tweed hat in a London department store, but it's foolish not to at a Greek outdoor market.

How much do you have to cut from other federal programs if you go slow on entitlements, such as Medicaid and food stamps?

It's appropriate to continue holding down the payroll tax, considering how high the unemployment rate remains and how wide the gap is between economic output and the country's capacity for production. But the cost isn't trivial: Each year the government has to borrow about $120 billion to reimburse the Social Security Trust Fund for the lost payroll taxes, which will be needed eventually to pay retirement benefits already promised to working Americans. That borrowing comes at the expense of future economic growth.
A: I'm reluctant to stand on a bully pulpit, and I'm probably not capable of describing an idealized picture we might have of the health-care system.

At 14,060 feet, Mount Bierstadt (above) is one of the easiest to ascend, with a wide trail that winds its way through swamps, high-mountain meadows and boulder fields. The journey begins at Guanella Pass, just south of Georgetown. If you worry about having never climbed that high before, put your fears aside. There are so many people - from young whippersnappers to truly elderly - hiking on weekends, it looks like a trip to the mall, but they'll offer assistance if you need it. Long's Peak by moonlight just might be the ultimate adventure. If that's not for you, climb one of the state's thirteeners, which are just as majestic but don't get the same attention. You're likely to see one of the state's Rocky Mountain goats staring down at you from a rocky crag, an eagle flying high above, or ubiquitous marmots on the ascent. If your health or other situations won't allow you to climb, then take the Cog Railway to the summit of Pikes Peak. Or drive to the top of Mount Evans. No matter how you get there, you really will be "on top" of the world, and there's no feeling like it.

Cantina 46 (One Star) 46 E. Superior St., 312-664-0100. A softly lit, contemporary cantina with good drinks and a usual-suspects menu, Cantina 46 might be utterly forgettable except for surprisingly careful execution from chef Servando Carmago (ex-Table Fifty-Two) and prices that seem even friendlier in Cantina's high-rent-district location.

--DH Edwin Encarnacion, who was playing first base in Sunday's 4-3 loss to the Angels, survived a hard-hit ball off his face in the seventh inning. He was not injured after INF Maicer Izturis smacked a grounder just inside the first base line, and it took a bad hop at the last moment, glancing off Encarnacion's cheek. "It wasn't on the cheekbone or the jaw so, fortunately, while it looked ugly, he escaped without any issue," manager John Farrell said.

The answer, I'd suggest, resides with him. That night, in my room at the 5 Twelve, I paged through "Essays, Speeches & Public Letters," reading his Nobel speech and his eulogy for Caroline Barr, on whom he modeled Dilsey, "born in bondage and with a dark skin and most of her early maturity was passed in a dark and tragic time for the land of her birth." I read a long essay from the 1950s, titled "Mississippi," in which he invokes both Yoknapatawpha and Oxford, conflating his characters — "the Sartorises and De Spains and Compsons" — with the members of his family, the saga of the state with his private longings and identifications, concluding that he has no choice but to "[love] all of [Mississippi] while he had to hate some of it because he knows now that you don't love because: you love despite; not for the virtues, but despite the faults."

The editorial "To dumb to be corrupt?" in Wednesday's Baltimore Sun really does more than just cite the total lunacy of the defense for Sen. Ulysses Currie, it also raises questions about the entire General Assembly. Have they all succumbed to the rising tide of selective ethical behavior seemingly swelling within public office holders? This is the very type of behavior that is the foundation for "it's only wrong if you're caught" mentality.

A few self-indulgent passages — the irrelevant history of an aristocrat who married a serf, some bizarre musings on how long it takes to die after being guillotined — exceed the proper limits of this approach. In general, however, the chronology moves forward, and the main outlines are clear: Catherine was a hardworking, well-informed ruler with leanings toward humane reform but with a firm belief that Russia could be governed only by an absolute monarch. Her more repressive attitude in the years before her death in 1796, when she instituted censorship and jailed a nobleman who advocated the gradual abolition of serfdom stemmed from her horror at the French Revolution and her fear that its regicidal ideas would spread to Russia.

Challenge time! It looks like slingshot bingo. The winners get a choice of three rewards: comfort, protection or luxury. Comfort is pillows and blankets, protection is a tarp (which the men have) and luxury is doughnuts and coffee. The slingshot thing is harder than it looks. And the women win! They certainly have redeemed themselves from the first couple of episodes. The men have to be a bit douchey and say that Salani’s winning streak is due to pure luck. The women, smartly, pick the tarp as their reward, but it must have been hard to leave those blankets and pillows behind.

I wasn't in any shape to tour extensively in Europe before. I was addicted and tired and it was really as much as I could do to earn a living for a while there. It was in 1983 that I got clean and sober; I didn't push for it for many years, and it wasn't until 1996-97 that I got serious about trying to do so. I'm glad that I still have the ability to tour in Europe. I do love it.

My take on this is informed by my own experience as a Mac user. Why did I use a Mac for so many years, despite the fact that PCs running DOS could do so much more, for so many years?

That may well increase the chances that this decision will be upheld by a broader panel of appeals judges and, eventually, by theU.S. Supreme Court. But it also means any eventual decision would likely fall short of what advocates want: an unequivocal statement that the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution render any law prohibiting same-sex marriage invalid. The plaintiffs in the case against Proposition 8 made a powerful argument for such a conclusion, and the defendants' case was laughably weak. Claiming, as Proposition 8 supporters did, that the state must endorse only opposite-sex marriage because of its interest in procreation is an argument against divorce or out-of-wedlock birth, or perhaps for a requirement that all married couples have children. Stripped of religious doctrine and tradition as justifications, it became clear that discrimination against same-sex couples can have no basis in law.

Weir's book, which begins with a lengthy family tree, operates as a good reference book about Mary and the Boleyns, but it's frustrating that there's very little known about the relationship between the two sisters. Henry VIII's desire for legitimate male heirs, the well-known religious division that occurred when he decided to marry Anne and her ultimate beheading are not the focus of this book - and Weir is clear about that - but scant details make it hard to know who Mary is. Mary's second marriage after she is widowed is not well-received, and she is not present during her sister's fall from favor.

It’s a nice thought, but don’t expect state Democrats Stephen Sweeney or Sheila Oliver to be raising their glasses to Christie anytime soon, even if he does throw his name in the presidential race.

In particular, the varying ways colleges treat assets from divorced parents is a big X-factor the calculators may not capture, as is merit aid. Some colleges will ask questions about grades and test-scores and include potential merit scholarship money when they give aid estimates. But calculators won't likely reflect the full range of more focused merit scholarships that might be available -- say, if there's money set aside for jugglers or violin players.

Still, these men want to go back to work and need jobs, which is where government can play a role.

PCR, or polymerase chain reaction, technology allows scientists to rapidly copy a single stretch of DNA using cycles of heating and cooling. Then it's a matter of adding fluorescent dyes to compare specific spots on that chunk of DNA with the relative's sample.

Other workers on the backside of the track—a different world from the pageantry seen on race day—were left to wonder if a killer was among them: Why did someone want 48-year-old Adan Fabian Perez dead?

3.) The Red Wings seem to have a quiet confidence about them. They know that theyre being written off, and theyve done little verbally to counter that claim. Its almost as if they know something that we dont about how well they can play in the postseason.
Likewise, we must realistically examine programs that are historically underenrolled or no longer strategically support our academic, medical and research enterprises and determine how best to use those resources. In the interim, I ask each of you to look for ways that we can eliminate unnecessary spending and allocate our tuition dollars where they can continue to move the University forward. I believe SLU is in a position to build on its strengths, and by controlling costs now we are better positioning ourselves for the future.

Paseo de Montejo, the wide, leafy boulevard modeled after Paris' Champs-Elysées, is lined with mansions built by henequén (sisal) barons whose plantations made Yucatan into Mexico's wealthiest state a century ago. Most are now restaurants, offices and hotels, but the Palacio Canton, perhaps the grandest of them all, is home to the Regional Anthropology Museum.

In Northwest author Jim Lynch's latest novel, "Truth Like the Sun," the Needle takes center stage. (His book's publication comes 50 years to the month after the kickoff of Seattle's World's Fair, which occasioned the Jetsonian monolith.) Much as Lynch's two prior novels were themselves depictions of Northwest communities in flux, "Truth Like the Sun" is conceived as a swirling portrait of the region's largest metropolis -- a place, like many a Western city, that's equal parts hucksterism, genuine civilizational hope, profiteering racket and progressive mecca.

A: I like them. Like I say, I pick movies I'd go and see. I'd go and see a big monster mash movie like "Wrath of the Titans" (the "Clash" sequel). I'd go and see a Terminator movie. And then something like "The Debt," I thought it was an intriguing idea. That's how I pick 'em. It's the only barometer I really have.
Jones and Merritt? They see bureaucratic silos, city commissioners who can't stop tapping the Water Bureau to pay for pet projects and -- with a lawsuit in the works and the citizenry aroused -- a commission that may yet enshrine that philosophy into the city charter.
"So one explanation for our result is that cellphones may be dangerous, but drivers are aware of the danger and drive more slowly or only use their cell in situations that are safe. They regulate themselves," Bhargava said. "Another possible explanation is that there is a set of risk-loving drivers out there who, if they weren't using their cellphones, might be involved in other distracting activities, such as playing with the radio."

øA job interview. "Recruiters I've talked to tell me most people don't ask questions in an interview or ask terrible ones such as 'What do you do?' or 'How much vacation do I get?'" he says. Instead, build credibility by phrasing questions around your abilities, such as "When I think back to my experience managing a sales force, I can think of three areas that were challenging -- what are the challenging issues for you?" He also suggests asking questions that tap into someone's passion, such as "What do you love most about working here?"

For younger families, the lure of buying long-term care insurance is that premiums are more reasonable than when they get older.

That would give the city until mid-September to approve the application, she said.

To be honest, finding old photos of grocery stores could be tough. It's not like people went there for parties or dates or family events, and in those days, taking pictures wasn't the everyday thing it is now with cameras in our cell phones.

•Put serious sanctions on the Central Bank of Iran, as the U.S. Senate voted 100-0 to do last week. The Central Bank of Iran conducts the bulk of Iran's international transactions and is the key financial facilitator of Iran's proliferation and terrorist activities. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1929 notes the potential connection between Iran's energy revenues and the funding of Iran's proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities. To stop the flow of petroleum commerce, the international community should pursue sanctions on the central bank as well as on oil companies, shipping firms, insurance providers and banks involved in such activity. The Senate amendment, sponsored by Sens. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, and Mark Kirk, an Illinois Republican, would penalize foreign institutions that carry out a "significant financial transaction" with the central bank.

Those scheduled tax hikes and spending cuts represent a "fiscal cliff," MacGuineas said, and if Washington goes over it, the country will likely fall into recession immediately. Ideally, lawmakers and the Obama administration will replace those abrupt changes with a plan that gradually but steadily shrinks the deficit and stops the debt from growing faster than the economy. What's more likely, though, is that they'll punt the issue to the next Congress and the president who begins his term in January. That's all the more reason to have Obama and Romney give voters a much clearer picture of what they would do to close the yawning federal budget gap.

The building's owner also owes money to the city of Cleveland, which kicked in a $2 million economic development loan for the rehab project.

Illegal immigrant student groups planned the demonstration for San Bernardino Valley College, where they say campus police have turned over students to local law enforcement agencies that collaborate with federal immigration authorities.

meats passing through the Chinese wood oven seem to get tough and often overdone from the experience. This was particularly the case with the beef fillet, and one night's brisket special was tasty but deeply chewy.

As (Chicago) Bulls' fan, I wanted the Bulls to draft him when he came out of college. I followed throughout his career, before I moved to Portland. I'm well aware of his accomplishments and what he has done. I don't know him personally, but I know a lot of people who do and I've never heard anybody say a bad thing about him. He became the face of the franchise and helped pull the Blazers through the tougher times.
Though Brown had a decent preseason with the Giants last year (95 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries), he wasn’t the player the team drafted. His heel prevented him from making the “jump cut” move that’s key to his agility. For example, he’d be running a stretch play to the left side and, when it came time to push off on the left foot, his body didn’t respond the way it usually does.
