I was pretty disappointed with my race execution the past two GS races — finishing ninth and 27th — and felt like I lacked intensity. I went into Saturday's GS with the attitude that I was going to win or DNF, go as hard as I could both runs.

Question: My girlfriend and I flew to Atlanta, where I had reserved and prepaid for a car at Avis' airport location. When I told the counter agent my girlfriend would be an additional driver, the agent told me it would cost an extra $13 a day to add her to the rental agreement. (She is well over 25 years old, like me.) When I asked what it was for, I got the "company policy" answer. Had she been my spouse or had this been a business trip and we both worked for the same company, there would have been no charge to add her to the agreement. After returning home, I called Avis customer service and spoke with a supervisor who had no idea what the purpose of the charge was and gave me the "company policy" answer. What is the reasoning behind this?

Gov. Martin O'Malley may not have gotten Exelon to bump up the $100 rate credit it promised to Baltimore Gas and Electric customers as part of its proposed merger with Constellation Energy, but he secured concessions that will be far more valuable to Maryland ratepayers in the long run. The settlement the governor plans to announce Thursday includes a vastly greater commitment to renewable energy and other new power generation than Exelon had ever agreed to before. It contains millions to help improve energy efficiency and assist low-income customers who have trouble paying their bills. And it is likely to produce substantially more short-term and permanent jobs than the energy company's initial proposal.

"America's Got Talent," and so does St. Louis.
The engagement argument comes down to this: Sanctions against Burma haven't worked. Two decades since the regime threw out the results of an election that it had (in its delusions of popularity) allowed, it is no more popular but no less entrenched. With U.S. companies and diplomats mostly absent, China has become the dominant power. The Burmese people remain poor and isolated from the world.

Hey, Anthony: The fact Memphis gave up on Henry -- a No. 12 overall pick in 2010 -- so quickly raises some red flags. I know he's had some injury problems, but it seems very strange.
The premium channel Starz is about to conclude a sprawling six-part miniseries based on a Ken Follett novel, "The Pillars of the Earth." The two-hour finale airs at 10 p.m. Friday.

I'd rather go with the flow down at the beach. Across most of the islands, traditional Christmas weather is nowhere to be felt. It's higher than 80 degrees during the day. No need to roast chestnuts on an open fire – just set them out on some tinfoil on a chair at the beach.

It was one of those days where I kept punching myself in the head, but I also kept telling myself, Keep going; it's gonna come,'  Kamara said. It bites for a second when it doesn't come, but you just have to forget it quickly and move on.
Prosecutors could not make the charges stick. Willis was acquitted and charges against Dearborn and Cooper were dropped.
But most blacks — a core part of Obama's base — do not. And Obama needs them to turn out in huge numbers as they did four years ago in places like Cleveland, Richmond, Va., and Charlotte, N.C., in order to win in such battleground states. The same goes for Democratic-leaning Hispanic voters. Most of them oppose gay marriage, and their backing will be critical to Obama in cities such as Miami, Las Vegas and Denver.

Deals like Freeman's led lawmakers in 2003 to require candidate searches before districts rehire recently retired superintendents.

In fact, Mr. Cheese, now a sophomore in high school with hopes of becoming a lawyer, provides a model in dealing with the sort of jerks who will always, unfortunately, be a presence in our schools. At the end of "Stop Bullying," he tells younger kids, "Just talk to somebody and I promise to you, it's going to get better." For Aaron, it plainly has: "It has been turned around actually. I am a generally liked guy. My last name has become something that's a little more liked. I have a friend named Mac and so together we are Mac and Cheese. That's cool."
Their backing reflects the growing mistrust by many Islamists of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood, the would-be flag-bearer for the religious vote.

If PG&E had confirmed at least one seam weld leak, it would have been required to check the San Bruno line for other such problems using high-pressure water - a test the company seldom used on any line. PG&E inspected most of its lines, including the one in San Bruno, with a cheaper, less burdensome method best suited at finding corrosion.
Herrera cited a report issued last month by an expert panel convened by the Public Utilities Commission to bolster his case. It found that for years before the San Bruno blast, an understaffed commission relied on a policy of "voluntary compliance" that allowed PG&E to largely self-audit and self-report violations, without the fear of fines.
Rose Olea, a Fernandez family cousin, said the grief-stricken family doesn't know how the boy died. "The police are still doing their investigation," Olea said.

They won another fiercely contested road game, outlasting the Suns, 119-111, in a game that was far from their comfort level and one that didn't end until 1:30 a.m. today.

But the Blues now lead this series 2-1, lead one of these rodeos for the first time in nine years. And the reason is, beating a decorated team like the Sharks is no longer a concept for the Blues. It's a commitment.

Voters in the 2nd Congressional District, which includes Boulder, have elected an openly gay congressman — Jared Polis, a Democrat.

Certainly, if I were an employer, I'd hire veterans. Not because I think they're heroes - very few are - but because young people get a lot of responsibility in the military. They might be in charge of expensive equipment. A young man barely old enough to drink might be in command of a group of heavily armed teenagers. I cannot imagine a greater responsibility.

Hand-stenciled signs pointed the way to the gift shop full of locally made crafts, the Lion's Den pub in the basement and Country Curtains, started in 1956 on the kitchen table of Jane Fitzpatrick, who ran the inn from 1968 to 1993, when her daughter Nancy took over. The curtain and décor shop — largely a mail-order and Internet business — is far more lucrative than the inn, Nancy later told me. When the inn's business slows after the first freeze, there are special packages and events to attract customers. But even in the dead of winter the Red Lion perseveres, catering chiefly to local tipplers, Chamber of Commerce dinners, skiers on their way to Vermont and the occasional loose screw who wants nothing more than to hole up in a classic country inn while the snow flies.
And yet, in the midst of tie-dyed revolution, young audiences were flocking to it? And watching cruel fate steal Ali MacGraw away from Ryan O’Neal and crying right through the ending just as fervently as their mothers?
Much the same happened last month when federally subsidized student loan rates were scheduled to rise, saving the government $6 billion a year.

Before the U.S. market opened, the government said workers were more efficient late last year, though productivity grew more slowly than in the summer. As productivity growth slows, businesses may need to hire more people to keep up with demand.

For some of the kids, the event was about prizes. Trophies were awarded for highest kite, best-drawn kite and longest-in-the-sky kite. But for others, the event was more about getting to draw. Deshawntae Olds, 14, drew a magnificent scene of the award winners on an Olympics-style podium. He came with his brothers to the event to escape an otherwise boring Saturday.
In those two sentences, the governor took a relatively simple problem (a potential deficit in the retirement system in a quarter-century) and inflated it into a criminal enterprise on par with Bernard Madoff and Charles Ponzi. Small wonder he's getting ripped by his fellow Republican presidential candidates, including at a subsequent debate in Tampa on Monday night.

The new owners are aware their franchise's prestige and fan support declined under McCourt, who sold the Dodgers for $2 billion to the group fronted by Johnson, headed by Walter and run by Kasten. Although they made the playoffs four times in McCourt's eight years, the Dodgers haven't won the World Series since 1988, before the O'Malley family's sale of the club sent it into an increasingly unsettling series of ownership changes.

It is most surprising to me that the City Council majority of SJC (and that includes Ms. Freese) still do not get it. Residents are complaining most vociferously, yet they turn a deaf ear and annually increase water rates to pay for their continuing wasteful policies. Why? Because they voted for this boondoggle (the groundwater recovery plant), and Ms. Freese has voted for every dollar spent on the "water factory" during her last three-plus years on the council.
During her tenure on the board, Steele fought hard for health issues, especially those involving children.

That's a blow to the ego of a continent accustomed to seeing itself as having a central place in history.

After more than two decades — and a Neil Young-meets-Velvet Underground style enshrined on the 1988 classic, “The Trinity Sessions” — Canada’s Cowboy Junkies keep evolving. The first in a series of conceptual albums, “Renmin Park” is based on guitarist-songwriter Michael Timmins’ three-month visit to China with his family (including children adopted from China). Soaking up a village’s sounds, he wrote a suite of songs about divided lovers. The album incorporates field recordings and more Chinese-style fiddling than guitar solos. However unlikely this concept album might be, the leap of imagination and empathy is remarkable. The group’s big-sky moodiness remains, too, as do Margo Timmins’ darkly sensual vocals.

There’s far too much merry chaos going on for any of it to really thrill, and working in all of these characters is inherently about as graceful as cat juggling. Still, Whedon keeps up the energy and keeps it good-humored.

Young people's romantic, and by extension sexual, choices have a long history of being stigmatized. Look no further than the outrage over premarital sex, even after the advent of birth control. Today, with the exception of pockets of religious communities and Rick Santorum, we've mostly gone sex-positive as a nation. . . . In other words, we have more or less embraced the reality that young people have sex before they get married, so they might as well be doing it safely. Yet cohabitation seems to have replaced premarital sex as the axe to grind among everyone from social conservatives to psychologists. Given that 70 to 90 percent of young people will live together before they get married, though, it's a pretty shortsighted view to the issue.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: I thought a major, major point of your argument was that the people who don't participate in this market are making it much more expensive for the people who do; that is, they will get, a good number of them will get services that they can't afford at the point where they need them, and the result is that everybody else's premiums get raised.

West and Jay-Z have always had a complicated relationship: mutually dependent, but always somewhat wary. It would not be inaccurate to liken it to a sibling rivalry. It was Jay-Z who gave West his start, hiring the fledgling producer, then just a tyro out of Chicago with big dreams, to make beats for his "Blueprint" album. West contributed music for several of the album's best tracks: the sing-song "Izzo," the dramatic "Heart of the City," and "The Takeover," Jay-Z's infamous declaration of New York City supremacy.
