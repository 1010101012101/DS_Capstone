It is as though the children who marched in Birmingham in 1963 are still singing, still marching, and now, pulling other children along, reminding them that it was through and because of children that a mean man, a mean system, and a mean culture was shaken to its core.

I have posted many times before about Mt Banks and its a favorite of mine for walks and mountain bike rides. The views are stunning and the tracks and trails are easy and well defined in the main.
We got onto this subject because Nick happened to mention that he was involved in the industry initiative known as 'Cyclops', which, although you might think you've never heard of - you probably do know what it is, and here's a visual clue...

And for the first time in a long time, a writer/director has created a teenage character who isn't obnoxious, cliched, irritating, or smarmy; Steinmeyer's 'Sean Donovan' is a kid you give a shit about, and you get the sense that he'd give a shit about you if you approached him as a human being, not a douche.
Gary was on the same page. I got in the car and he was fuming. (It was actually very funny.) He kept ranting, "I paid an extra $1 a day for THIS?!" We went back to the car rental place and explained that surely there must have been some confusion. They explained that no, this is what we get.
- tim finished his scheduled school classes early...so he's actually going to accelerate. he was able to just test out of two of his classes and that freed up a lot of time. the semester isn't over until december, so he can fit in another class or two. I'm really proud of him - he's able to work full time, do online classes full time, and he still spends so much time with us girls. we're lucky to have him.
Under these conditions it is very difficult to blog...so I thank you for your patience. As of this week, I have resumed normal digestion of my food (you have no idea), unpacked all our boxes of clothes shipped home, attended to our garden, and resurrected my old (but still mostly functional camera)..
February 2011. Abstracts should be submitted

From Law’s richly comic accounts of life in a distinctly white-bread region of Australia we excerpt his droll account of the awkwardness of being gay in a predominantly ‘straight’ world.

(which, BTW Barack, that doesn't make you look 'alienated', it marks you as being not only a sell-out, but a poser sellout, but I digress), what a wonder His Arrogantness & his campaign staff, would choose such an Anti-American slogan as their Campaign theme... well, I'm certainly wearing my surprised face. And please, if you think the smartest man in the world, and the smartest administration ever, stocked full of proregressives, communists, and Maoists, weren't fully aware that the most popular far left theme of the last century was 'Forward!' (hello, 'Progressive!' ?), then there's not a whole lot of nice things you've left me to say about your own ability to think things through. President Obamao wants to lead us Forward! to silencing the speech of his opponents, Forward! to trampling upon the freedom of people to abide by their religious beliefs, Forward! to forcing people to comply with how the government tells them how to live, Forward! to taking or destroying the property of those the mob is stirred up against so as to spread their (remaining) wealth around. Sorry, but that's not Forward!, that is not Progress, that is, as Calvin Coolidge noted, nothing but Regress. All of which, IMHO, is so very appropriate and fitting with my pet term for his and their ideology, ProRegressives.
That was in a nutshell! I am sure as we progress with this blog you will find out much more about me.
However, the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Chief Olisa Metuh, told our correspondent on the telephone that the disagreement between the party and the NSA had not reached the level of calling for his sacking.

Afraid that you were just a figment of my imagination
For the pastry dough, place the sifted flour into a large bowl and add the dry yeast, and mix it in. Add the sour cream, and the softened butter. Use your hands, or a standing mixer with a paddle attachment, to work it into a dough using a dough hook. Beat for several minutes or until dough doesn't stick to sides of bowl. Add a little flour if needed. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 3-5 hours, or overnight if you like.

What is placenta previa? If you’ve heard the word, you have probably figured out just from the word alone that it has something to do with the placenta. You are exactly right. Placenta previa occurs when the placenta attaches in the lower portion of the uterus instead of in the normal position in the upper more muscular portion of the uterus. Placenta previa is a frequent cause of bleeding during the second and third trimester of pregnancy
Perhaps most importantly, some players simply have a "Heroism Value" which dictates their character choices. They have the attitude that they're going to play their PCs in a heroic way, like Marvel superheroes or Conan the Barbarian! After all, would Captain American flee a losing battle and leave his peers to die? No way! Would Conan run away and leave a maiden at the hands of evil cultists? No way! (Well, he might consider it, but he wouldn't actually do it). By the way, I'm not implying that this heroism value equates to sure and certain suicide. But it certainly means that life and limb will be risked in fairly dire situations - because that's what brave fantasy adventurers do!

But I had suspicions regarding the iguana owner's edginess - that he might have had some concern other than losing potential modeling fees for his critter. I never did investigate the laws regarding exotic pets in the city. A quick search and I learned that housing an iguana as a pet is a violation of the New York City Health Code. There is so much rumor mongering and misinformation in life, I have decided to reprint the code here in its entirety, exactly as written, directly from the New York City government website. So here, In the spirit of Everything No, is article 161.01 - Wild Animals Prohibited:

You have to be aware that the selectors (three to each panel of eight candidates) will be asking as many unspoken questions of you during meal-times, as they do in interview. This could make meals a slightly edgy affair as you are meant to circulate around the different tables through the course of the conference (the selectors stay in the same seats each meal), but to be honest, it was just fun getting to know a bit about them, their ministries and hobbies, as well as your fellow candidates. The food is plentiful and lovely.
It's that time of year again, and even though I'm a bit late on the postage about this, there's still time to get tickets.

There are two sessions for you to attend, the afternoon session from 1:30 PM to 4:30 PM, and the evening session From 6:00 PM until 9:00 PM. All proceeds will go to the Central PA Humane Society.
Apologies to anybody who has already seen the result of the first pouch but thanks to freaking out about the two swaps I'm in, I don't have lots of new things to show this week. Fortunately there was a teensy bit of progress on my ideas for the swaps.

Pastiche like this, I think lowers the status of the original piece because most of the time it is mocking the history or the cultural trend. It also is similar to mass producing something like the Mona Lisa, not that comparing the work on graphjam.com to the Mona Lisa but what I mean is that when the Mona Lisa became mass-produced it lost a lot of its value because everyone can have it on their bags or their shirts.

The important thing he was pointing out–and that we would do well to meditate upon–is that the final Resurrection, as it pertains to us as individuals, will only do two things: get rid of sin, and give us new bodies. Our souls, our personhood, our consciousness, and everything that makes us “us” in the truest senses of the word, have already been fully resurrected!

One of the programs that Keeneland runs during its fall and spring race meets is a Saturday morning breakfast where people can come and watch the horses train while scarfing down scrambled eggs, sausage, and biscuits with gravy. While the food is decent, the real draw of the program is being out there early in the morning and watching the horses run as the rising sun begins to burn away the pre-dawn mists. It’s thrilling to stand at the rail as a pair of jet black thoroughbreds come sprinting down the track toward you. You can hear their hooves clomping in the dirt and their breathing pulsing louder and louder as they get closer. Then they fly past so quickly, your eyes have a tough time keeping up. Fortunately, you will get another chance as a second pair and then a third and a fourth will following in short order.

An outbreak of spectacular weather for the Inter-mountain West for May 8th, 2012! This is the nicest weather I’ve found thus far doing this blog with the mean across the nation just a tad over a PWI 6. This is despite New England dragging the index down with a good soak tomorrow. Good for my garden though! By far the best weather in the nation will be any basin in the West. The Treasure Valley of Idaho, the Wasatch Front in Utah, all of northern Nevada and many other areas will see 9′s. Some of the best bets tomorrow will be Twin Falls, Idaho, Salt Lake City, Utah, Reno, Nevada, Walla Walla, Washington. Outside the West, really the only place I can recommend is the Kansas City metro area.

Well, I went back to the Liberty Bowl yesterday afternoon to see the Dawgs play. Upon finding my seat and taking in the view, I was immediately reminded of that Tigers game years back. But I thought to myself that today is different because I’m going to have a chance to cheer on a real football team. I could not have been more mistaken.

Of course that final week was a memorable one. It ended with Caroline leaving in tears, my mother going through the shakes and sobering up and an Indian tenant leaping to his death from a 4th floor window. The gypsies on the ground floor who caught his landing said his “head cracked open like a coconut and he bit his tongue off”. They also said he was “bollock naked”. Unfortunately all that was left we arrived was the blood. A dark red stain in the shape of Ireland.
Expect to never get your gun back. You may get it back one day but maybe not. Do not buy expensive guns for the street. Buy yourself a nice sporting gun if you want a nice gun. Keep your street guns basic. The factory Model 10 Smith and the GI 45 have done a lot of work over the years and aren't fancy.

But for the better part of the 20th century, this two-flat was packed with family, friends, and neighbors. My mother spent the first few years of her childhood here, in fact. Holidays and birthdays were especially festive, but at its peak it was a full and busy house from day to day, overflowing with children, spouses, grandchildren, and cousins, at any given time.
Then there’s the Sunday.
With real food, there’s shopping, defrosting, preparing, scheduling, cooking, etc.! So tonight I got home late, so it was almost 6. Normally I eat a product at 5, then again at 8. So I was already hungry at 6. I quickly put the halibut and fresh asparagus (after some short prep) into foil and into the oven. Then had to wait, wait, wait, getting hungrier. Kept opening the oven and poking the fish. THEN the fish was finally done but the asparagus still quite crunchy.
It was like she was there: in my heart, like she was literally living inside of me and I could even feel and hear her…. that warm feeling was always present in my heart. How strong was my heart beating when I was talking to her, when I was looking in her eyes, when I was dreaming about her, when I was writing to her, for her, about her, when I was composing poems and songs to her, I was so happy back then because the Goddess of Love was in my heart and my heart was alive.

to do in terms of a Christian conversation is to disagree, and to disagree publicly. That’s why I so respect President Carter’s willingness to enter in to this conversation, and even as it was an opportunity for him to speak of his deepest convictions, it is also an opportunity for us to consider what these things mean, not only to the church in terms of its past, but in terms of its present and future. I deeply appreciate the willingness of President Carter to enter into this conversation. As I said in the conversation, I greatly honor him for so much that he has been able to do in the world. Eradication of disease and the alleviation of human suffering. I am thankful for the boldness

Super easy to make because there is no butter to have to work into the flour. The fat that the butter usually supplies is in the heavy cream you use. Flour, baking powder, sugar, salt and heavy cream. If you mix it with a light hand, and treat it somewhat gently you are rewarded with light, tender, delicious biscuits! I served mine with just a little butter on them, along side some chicken tenders I made. The next day I used them to make sausage and egg biscuits. They were delicious both ways. Melissa used hers with sausage gravy...I sure could go for a plate of that right now...maybe I will go whip up another batch of these for lunch! :)

How often do we complain when health fails? We question the working of God when things just don’t go right. We know we’re saved for we are bought with the price. We understand His purpose of grace for this dispensation. We prayerfully press toward that mark. We commit all things to Him as a living sacrifice. Even then, things just don’t seem to go right and I ask you, “in whose eyes?” His grace is sufficient even if don’t claim it.
Today is the beginning of the Ten in 10 but there is still plenty of time to join! The great thing about the Ten in 10 is that it is whatever you need it to be to get healthy or maybe you just need some motivation to maintain your healthy lifestyle.
Once you know that they can’t run the football, that’s when you get some exotic blitzes or you can play a lot of coverage… We’ve been able to do that all year long — stop the run with seven guys in the box. And it’s really one of the keys to our success.

Berns study is unique in the sense that sacred and very high moral values were assessed.

When French colonials moved to Canada at the start of the 18th century they took their “Poque” with them. It then travelled further south to the New Orleans and spread at first all around Louisiana where it was played in the famous floating saloons and than later all over the country. One of the earliest contemporary mentions of poker happened in J Hildreth book “The Dragoon Campaigns to the Rocky Mountains” in 1836. The game of the time seemed to be a 20 card deck variation played with Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks and Tens which were divided between the players to make the best hand, there were no communal cards.

Why "inevitable conflict"? we relied on Japan for our cars and TVs for years with no conflict. Without recognising jihadism as the problem, Hari is doomed to see Western policy as the instigator of all Islamic ills. Indeed, he is left with the following conclusion:
To conclude; the West’s sentimental attachment to the myth of the Noble Savage is irrational, to say the least. This feel good creation of the West’s, sometimes very naive, idealism is but another burden foisted on him on/in his quest to rationally approximate and understand the truth about this world we’ve been thrown into. Primitive societies are simply what they are namely, primitive. It is absolutely foolish of us to look to them for any guidance in an era which has long since disproved any claim to truth they could ever conjure up. And for us to employ the banal primitiveness of the Noble Savage to act as the conscience (as we did with Mandela!) to issue guilt for the perennial ‘sins’ (e.g. over-industrialization) we inevitably commit in/our quest to find the elusive answers to the questions that have made us the most progressive people on the planet, is even more idiotic. In short; the Noble Savage is dead!
The Poisoning in the Teacher’s Room (A): Mike and Marge both teach at the local high school. They don’t like each other very much, and clash repeatedly during their daily exchanges in the teacher’s room. Finding it’s all too much to take, Mike decides to poison Marge. In the teacher’s room there are two large pots containing loose-leaf tea leaves or ground coffee. Marge drinks coffee every day. So Mike decides to place a quantity of poison in the coffee pot, just prior to her taking some to make her daily cup of coffee (he’ll replace it after, before anyone else takes some poison). He does this and succeeds in poisoning and killing Marge.
Why else would the Justice Department challenge the photo ID law in Texas? To charge Republicans with seeking to disenfranchise Hispanics and blacks, of course.

Fleur is indeed amber, and it is unfiltered: it's a uniformly hazy amber. But it is not uniform in taste, it's like no other beer I know, almost gruit-like in its spicy, herbal, vegetative intensity. It's like running through a hot meadow full of the blooming variety of summer, kicking up the warmed aromas released as you flash through the fields. It is perhaps my very favorite spiced beer, moreso than all the spiced winter beers and witbiers. Fleur is a beauty, an unabashed blast of flavors that meld into a beautifully intense experience. I intend to grab all of it I can get.
Chucks love interest with the new girl Amy was so freakin' cute, I love that he loved her and that she loved him back. It was super swoon-worthy and made you root for Chuck even more that he would get the girl in the end (NO, i'm not telling you if he does, this is a spolier-free review)

i have alot of friends on the internet. in my wanderings around the country, i have had the joy of meeting so many of them, and deepening those relationships. it has been a hard road, finding community in my life, something to do with knowing from an early age that the world had another story, that there was another way to be....it has been through this "artificial" means of cyberspace that i have cobbled together my community, my tribe. however far-flung they may be, whether or not we have met in the flesh, they are as real and solid as any i have had in my life. and there is something particularly binding in the shared beliefs.... the knowing....that draws us together.

While I hate seeing negative dollars on my carried trades, these are the weeks that make the market fun. It’s volatile and somewhat random. In my case, I look at it in a “need to spend money to make money” sort of way. I’m buying/selling retraces, and ultimately expect the prevailing long-term trends to continue. Whenever that happens, the account jump will more than offset the decline.
Couch surfing was, in all seriousness, just what I needed to remind me how beautiful it is to trust people and how incredible strangers can be if you give them a chance. Our host in Prague, Michelle, was so great! She took us in even though she was battling an awful cold and even let us sleep in her bed. She gave us great food and sights recommendations and even cooked for us – twice. And we had never met her before we showed up at her tram stop. Talk about incredible experiences. You all know by now that one of my favorite things to do is talk; we spent a good five hours talking to her and her boyfriend over dinner and wine one night. I live for moments like those, and it was incredible to experience that in a whole other country so far from home.

No, not I’m talking about the election or national politics. I mean the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington D.C. Suddenly, after being embarrassed by an orthodox priest who refused communion to a manifest public sinner, the bishop has removed Fr. Guarzino from ministry. Why? Because “over the past week or so” there have been “credible allegations that Father Guarnizo has engaged in intimidating behavior towards parish staff and others that is incompatible with proper priestly ministry.”

We topped off the car at a petrol station in Budoran and got into a discussion with the attendant about the states. He had been to New York and Philadelphia about 10 years ago and was amazed at how clean New York was now compared to his first visit in the 80′s. When we told him that even Philly had cleaned up a bit, he was really shocked. His main impression of Philadelphia, even 10 years ago, was how dirty the streets were. It’s really sad that people in Philly don’t realize what a gem of a city we have and how many tourist related jobs would be created if we just cleaned the city up a little more.

After I got a ride with a Christchurch worker returning home from his holiday down south, and some fisheries workers I encountered what must’ve been the worse case of “adaption syndrome.” I was picked up by a big proper looking gentleman in a cleaning van. I was so keen to make a good first impression that I made the WORST impression! After stuffing around asking silly questions “I-i-iss it okay if I place my bag in the back?” and, “Ohhh, c-c-can I place my bag on top of your cleaning stuff?” “Yes sir, thank ye sir,” I got in the car. He asked me what I did, and sure enough he spent the next 15mins lecturing me about how I really didn’t know anything about the bible. He frequently asked if my parents knew where I was, and our brief car ride ended with him patting me on the knee saying, “Good boy, good boy.” HA! Adaption is not about transformation in differing environments, it’s about knowing who you are and getting through the challenges of that environment. In my thirst to be appear considerate, polite, and be accepted I came across as a weak boy with no experience of the world. The trick is not to lie flat on my back in the face of the alpha male. It’s to stay my ground, and know who I AM.
It feels like gravity has grabbed me and sucked me into a downward spiral and no amount of awareness of conscious breathing seems able to stop it.

The days and weeks following were very difficult for both me and my roommate. She didn’t get information about her extended family north of Sendai for a while after it happened and on top of that, her dad was part of the defense army as a doctor and he volunteered to go and help with the earthquake victims shortly after it had happened. I had never seen my roommate cry until this happened and I was there for her every step of the way, even forcing her to come home with me for Spring Break about 2 weeks later because she would have been alone at school and I didn’t want to leave her alone during that time.
And, just to slow me down a LITTLE bit more, I forgot to follow my own directions to size fabric larger when lining with it! It shrank and I ended up having to find and order more. While waiting on it, I dropped some hints as to what was coming. If you want to know info I didn't include here on any of the process, let me know!
If we’re going to point our kids to Jesus as the Savior of sinners, then it’s not enough to simply have regular family devotions (or family worship). Certainly those times are extremely important, but as believing parents, we need to create an environment of gospel-telling, and that doesn’t happen with just 15-20 minutes in the Word with them a few times a week. It happens when we combine family worship with the discipline of connecting everyday moments to the cross.
Number two is the need to pay more attention to Dark Boundaries, not just for the self-promotion angle, but the ability to blog about subjects that aren’t appropriate here. I also want to stop posting my fiction here, and put it on Dark Boundaries. So, after the last chapter of Privileged Lives goes up, that will be it.

Keeping farm green isn�t an easy task in hot weather. But Papamma has been managing it for almost 20 years now. She produces crops through organic way. Besides, the family is content with the yield they get from two acres and one acre of paddy field. In two acres, she grows almost 20 varieties of crops. �If we have sufficient water we can grow more than 50 varieties of crops in the farm,� says Papamma. “

The ORNL report clearly notes that it does not include “inventories of government production reactor spent nuclear fuels that have been reprocessed in the manufacture of nuclear weapons for national defense…” (ORNL Data Base, 1994, p. 2); it is highly unlikely that all 239Pu produced by government reactors from 1944 to 1994 have been recycled into weapons grade plutonium without creating more than 3,919 kg of waste as listed in the DOD report.
Oddly enough, I've always been able to do this. People always are amazed at this "hidden talent". Doesn't take me all that long either. When I was in my teens, I did a stoopid amount of Boy George, circa "Karma Chameleon". I loved his hair, his make-up, his clothes... Ah, wasn't he just the most fabulous? *happy sigh*
I am thankful to my father, Perry Greene, for showing me how to convey the message of love to my kids. When my parents were together, and even after they split up, when I was just entering my teenage years, my pops was always very good at saying, “Son, I love you.” Of course, I didn’t recognize the power of those words coming from my father until I grew much older, but I did recognize at a young age that a lot of the other kids whose parents weren’t around or who just simply didn’t get that from their fathers would pay attention or notice when my father was affectionate with me. My father showing me that love affected me in such a positive way. He was focused on independence and strength and knowledge. He would tell me that he loved me and respected me. That was really big for me growing up. My father treated me like a person and not like a second class citizen or someone who was beneath him. He treated me like I mattered… I knew without a doubt that my parents loved and respected me, so I felt no need to rebel against them. That is the relationship I want to have with my children. I want them to know that no matter what mistakes they make, no matter if they choose to become a rapper, ballplayer, singer, doctor, lawyer, scientist, teacher or whatever their hearts desire, I want them to know that their daddy will always love them, respect them and have their back.
This story opened my eyes to a part of history I hadn’t known much about before. But even though there is a wealth of carefully researched historical information in this novel, it’s woven naturally into a suspenseful story. I worried right along with Solomon about whether he’d find his father or his grandfather again, and how he would fit into his new life and find the person he wanted to be. Solomon’s strong voice kept me inside the story. As a writer, I admire the way the author uses visual and other sensory images in her writing. I would read this novel again.
One of those girly-chick-lit-trashy-romance types that get me hooked…a gateway drug if you will.

So yesterday my caching tour took me to an old part of Planet Newy. Originally built in 1856, it was a light tower for navigational purposes for the harbour. It was rebuilt in 1877 because the Wesleyans built a bigger building in front of it (nobody thought about that one, did they?). The bearings of the entrance channel to the harbour were altered in 1918, so it was no longer necessary. For once, this is a historic part of town that hasn't been left to crumble and become forgotten - or too messed up to bother fixing! A real treasure indeed.

Note that Gimtu (Gath/Tell es-Safi) and Ginti (Gath-Carmel/Baqa Jatt) are distinct cities. Rubutu is probably Arubboth/Araba in the West Bank, due to its nearness to Ginti and its consistency with being the Rubutu of the Taanach letters and the Shoshenq list. Suardatu is the king of Gimtu and Milkilu is the king of Gazru/Gezer. Qiltu is Keilah, a city of Jerusalem which allied with Gath.

While the master is confident and open the slave is neither sincere nor candid even with himself. Nietzsche predicts that this race of slave will be more secretive and prudent than the race of masters will be far more likely to be imprudent: to charge ahead valiantly, to live through ‘ecstatic bursts of love, reverence, gratitude…’ As a result when the masters feel ressentiment they react immediately and quickly forget what upset them. Often indeed what would upset the slaves will not upset the masters at all. The masters have ‘an inability to take seriously for any length of time their enemies, their disasters, their misdeeds…’ They will not remember the insults they suffer from weaker beings; their ‘wounds’ heal quickly and are forgotten.

Callie was amazing at the zoo! She walked about 75% of the way through the zoo, and fell very infrequently, she didn't even bring her walker today! For those who know the trail of vines at the Woodland Park Zoo, the bridge that goes around the orangutans, Callie walked all the way UP it on her own, without falling. It was awesome! I think she also won the heart of several grandparents who were there, who kept coming up to me as we would meet through the zoo and comment on how well she is doing, how hard she is working, how her smile lights up everything around her, and how she is just a precious ray of sunshine! We also heard several comments from the same people about how nice it is to see a bigger family, and how well behaved and polite everyone is. (It is always nice to hear good comments about both having a bigger than average family and Callie.)
She is dressed in burgundy velvet, her black cloak, also velvet, is intricately embroidered in gold all the way to the end of it’s 4 meter train. The palio above her is embroidered to match. Her gilded halo shimmers in the night glow of candles and street lamps. The beautifully sculpted silver base overflows with white flowers: lilies, roses, carnations, freesias, gladiolas. She rests in front of us, I can hear the costaleros sigh in relief. A spontaneous saetero pays her homage, singing the traditional flamenco type song of pain and lament. At its end another admirer cheers Viva la Virgen, the crowd responds with Viva! They repeat this three times and the crowd breaks out in wild applause. The music begins again, the costaleros take their position and repay this homage with their beautiful display of maneuvers. As they progress down the street to the beat of the drum, the crowd’s applause lingers.

I have a very ambiguous relationship Wuthering Heights. It seems to turn up on a regular basis in my studies, and I find it very interesting, but just not very likeable. And those people who think it's a wonderful love story ... *cough*. I've been to Haworth a number of times, as my friend lives nearby, and you can see samplers stitched by Emily, Charlotte and Anne in the Parsonage Museum. The borders to this piece are from Emily's sampler, as are her initials, but the main lettering is from other sources. Although she was referred to in the family as "Emily Jane" I've used EB because Wuthering Heights was published under the nom de plume Ellis Bell. 1847 refers to the date of publication of the novel. Poor Emily died the following year.
The blog’s original title was “Now the story of a wealthy family who lost everything”. Though appropriate for a blog about the show “Arrested Development” (it is a line in the show’s intro), it was not appropriate for this post because the post was directed towards an audience that would not catch the reference. Since the characters were my favorite part of the show, I thought explaining the main parts would be the best way to introduce this phenomenal show. My conclusion quickly touches on my own family’s level of dysfunction when compared to the family in “Arrested Development”, which makes my post more relatable to the reader.

On Wednesday I was starving when I got to Hunter for my fiction workshop. Class was due to start in seven minutes and I needed food fast. I got on the long line at the Starbucks, thinking maybe a slice of lemon poundcake. My professor and a classmate were ahead of me, but it's not fair to cut, even through someone else. Plus, I realized, needed something more substantial than poundcake. I'd had a busy day--I wrote a blog post, tweeted, facebooked, read classmates' stories for workshop, made phone calls, obsessed about my unwritten thesis, obsessed about my soon to be released novel. This ongoing ephemeral busy-work had left me exhausted. I hadn't spent more than an hour at a time with my children since Sunday. What I needed was soup.

I had thought that Grayson Perry's best show to date was The Charms of Lincolnshire, where he created a collection of works responding to a rural, agricultural and domestic museum collection. The Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman continues and develops this theme but with a much greater emphasis on the talisman, the votive and the ritual object. It probably tops the earlier show. It's wonderful, moving and funny. Go and see it!

I could not find any questions for this book, nor a reader’s guide. Once again, I need to rely on my own memory to create some queries that hopefully will encourage people’s thoughts on the story.

We re-evaluate our ‘scene.’ We discover what common sense is in each of our lives and apply it without prejudice.

Lappe argued that by combining particular foods such as rice and beans, which was done in the diets of older cultures, vegetarians could obtain proteins that are as complete as protein derived from meat.

Remakes are as common today as ever before, much to the chagrin of many moviegoers. For my money, I don’t mind watching a remake if it is done well, serves a purpose, or happens to be a remake of a film I missed the first time around, as is the case with And Soon the Darkness. This 2010 film is a remake of the 1970 movie of the same name, and has been Americanized, replacing two British female lead characters on a trip to France (1970 version) with two American girls on a trip to Argentina (2010 version). And Soon the Darkness is nothing more than a mediocre effort, with little to set itself apart from other thrillers in this style.
So the same advanced group went further and the same lame group stayed behind. We just sat there for a while looking at the beauty of the lakes and headed back. Then it started. It seemed as the skies just opened and it poured torrential rain. I thought it usually drizzles in Alaska, but this definitely wasn’t the case. I also decided not to get sweaty in the rain pants ans didn’t take them. Should have known better. By the time we reached the camp I was wet, everywhere except the boots. For some reason that brand new Columbia Peak Assent jacket leaked through. Not a lot, but still. I thought it was completely waterproof. Anyway, I just went into the my tent to dry out. Igor and Girish were sitting there cooking water. I guess they didn’t care any more about the rain. Igor was actually so nice to bring me tea to the tent.
I always found it hard to charge when it comes to horses, for example. If you find a horse in nature and you 'heal' it or rather, 'arrange' the horse so that it can heal itself - you can't charge the horse. The energy exchange was between you and the horse and it was pure energy that can't be changed into money, as it is a near spiritual experience (for me it is anyway).

Under normal circumstances, no one would notice the empty store front with the “For Lease” sign propped up in the front window.

The city of Newark had almost forgotten about this once family oriented neighborhood. The twin black Yukons, parked out front, should seem out of place, but no one noticed.

I use this to try to get me in the habit of walking a little briskly during my walk intervals. I can lollygag on the trail, I have to think about walking faster as my tendency is to go to stroll mode. On the treadmill, I usually set my walks at between 14 an 15mph....the slower is definitely very comfortable for me and my go to when I get really out of breath. This brings me to my run intervals....I make a game of it. I start out slow - and work up. I an an interval runner - run a little walk a little and here is a typical workout for me on the treadmill .....when it gets fast I either keep up or fall off (hey its only a minute) oh and "mph=miles per hour". I do my intervals so every minute after the IPOD Interval Runner App tells me to either walk or run, I manually set the speed every minute, which the machine I use makes it super easy.

This still gives an incentive to be in work as your allowances will expand because of your needs as an employee. However the difference between being unemployed and employed should not be that vast. In Denmark they have a scheme called ‘Flextid’ (flexi time) where people with chronic conditions (such as myself) can work up to 25 hours a week and still get 90% of their wage, the difference is paid by our local kommune (council). So it need not be such a huge gap to be an incentive to work, 10% is enough – it has kept me in full time work for over 3 years and I’m trying to wait as long as possible before relying on it, in case I can’t go back to full time work again.

While I don’t think that Miss Fisher’s is all that good of a murder mystery (when watching a good murder mystery at some point you might think to yourself “oh that’s neat!” or “how clever!” or “this should be interesting!” or “this is going to be fun!” – which I rarely do when watching Miss Fisher’s) I think that its biggest problem is that it lives on the ABC. When the ABC should have been giving us creatively daring series they’ve given us a legal drama (Crownies), a crime drama (The Straits) and a murder mystery (this thing); even The Slap, which was quite good, was still an adaptation of a critically acclaimed, best-selling novel; hardly a risk. The only thing Miss Fisher’s can really do to fix this problem is to become something that it is not. This is a murder mystery that appears uninterested in world building and allergic to anything beyond the bare-minimum of serialization – this isn’t the stuff great shows are made of; this is the stuff fluffy Friday night filler is made of.

The PPV Would be solid and most importantly a LOT of fun. During the evening Kurt Angle showed why he is in my mind the best wrestler since Ric Flair when he and Ken Anderson tore down the house. Team 3D was on fire and ST Louis fans proved that it is truly Flair country when he was asked to leave by the ref prior to the AJ Styles – D’Angelo Dinero the fans chanted “We want Flair” chants. Jeff Hardy would show why he is one of the most fearless (or crazy) wrestlers to ever grace the sport during the main event giving Team Hogan a huge advantage over Team Flair.

“It’s all quite plausible,” she said. “The torso of a flat-chested woman is not that different in appearance from a male one, and the girl was obviously brought up to believe that nice girls don’t look at men’s groins.

We find this kind of life in relationship with the God who gives. That’s what our understanding of grace is all about – our God gives. He’s not a god who sits far off in heaven & expects us to give & give & make sacrifice after sacrifice to try to make him happy. Our God is happy with us for Christ’s sake & so is happy to give us what we need. He gives rain to the unrighteous & righteous alike (check out Matthew 5:44-45 for example) and so his giving is unconditional & indiscriminate. The clearest place we see the heart of this giving God is in giving his Son to die for us, and Jesus himself is willing to give himself for us on the cross. This goes beyond a trite & cliché religious formula – it’s the greatest expression of sacrificial giving ever! If God is willing to give us his own Son, and if the Son is willing to give all of himself to us in his death, and if the Father is willing & able to give his dead Son new life in the resurrection, how much more will he be willing to give us what we need for every aspect of life, both in this world & in the next?

When tragedy strikes Michele Windsor’s world, she is forced to uproot her life and move across the country to New York City, to live with the wealthy, aristocratic grandparents she’s never met. In their old Fifth Avenue mansion filled with a century’s worth of family secrets, Michele discovers a diary that hurtles her back in time to the year 1910. There, in the midst of the glamorous Gilded Age, Michele meets the young man with striking blue eyes who has haunted her dreams all her life – a man she always wished was real, but never imagined could actually exist. And she finds herself falling for him, into an otherworldly, time-crossed romance.

Last week’s discussion of Daniel Frampton’s book Filmosophy, as well as the brief mention of object ontology, had me thinking about artists outside the medium of film using metaphors of the mind. In his book, Frampton traces a rich history of writers considering film as analogous to the operations of the mind, be it as a record and reproduction of perception or as a representation of mental states. The most difficult proposal to swallow in Frampton’s text is his insistence of film’s autonomy. He writes, “for a ‘film-being’, filmosophy wishes to place the origin of film-thinking ‘in’ the film itself. There is no ‘external’ force, no mystical being or invisible other. It is the film that is steering its own (dis)course” (Frampton 73).
Sometimes it seems like whisky quality is inversely proportional to the hype surrounding it. I can no longer count the amount of times I've been let down by highly touted special releases. On the other hand, obscure indy bottlings or even budget daily pours are sometimes unpublicized gems. During the holiday season, the whisky hype can get totally out of the control, which is why it is especially refreshing to find some bottles that meet if not exceed the hype.

Here are some of my favorite motivational quotes on change.
And I know that my grief is just a tiny fraction of what Dave and Laura are going through. They are two of the most beautiful people I've ever known, and this has truly shattered them. Grief is an individual journey, different for everyone, and as much as I love them both and want to walk this road beside them, I know that ultimately they need to walk it alone. Each in their own way, they need to figure out how to cope with this grief that they'll carry with them for the rest of their lives. They will, in time. They'll learn to cope. But time does not heal all wounds. This one is forever.

One of the wonderful things about the times I grew up in -- I'm speaking specifically about the Sixties and Seventies -- was that it was a period that supported personal growth and consciousness-raising. Whatever excesses occurred that make that period easy to parody, it truly was a time when many people who had never been encouraged to explore themselves were able to do so, especially -- though certainly not limited to -- those involved in the feminist and gay liberation movements. It was an era when Gestalt therapy (which I've been deeply involved with both as a peer counselor and client), EST, and all kinds of self-help and support groups flourished. However incomplete or imperfect the results, it was a time of healing.

One of the things I’ve used the pendulum as well, and I think not many people do this with theirs, is that use it to channel entities for communication. It’s the same theory with the Ouija board, isn’t it? I’ve been wondering why not many people have used it for that. Mind you. I wouldn’t use it on deities you are not familiar with and if you are to do this with your pendulum – you would need to do a cleansing every session.
Another important bit of background information to grapple with for a novice is the idea that planets get in different moods depending on what houses they own. So you can have a benefic in a really “bad mood” if they own difficult houses in the chart. Visa versa, you can have a malefic in a very “good mood”. For example when Capricorn rises, Jupiter owns a “bad house” (the 12th), and this puts him in a “bad mood”. Jupiter is always a gentle and benefic planet, but for some rising signs he is in better moods then others.
I understand your concern, though. It took me awhile to gather the courage to come out of that shame spiral and decide that I wasn't a bad person for having such aberrant sensibilities.

The prevailing sentiment is that of an accumulation of lost opportunities: regret that the Kim Ki-young did not live to complete what was to have been his ‘comeback’ film, Diabolical Woman; regret at not having had the occasion to speak with the director, or in the case of Bong Joon-ho, not realizing at the time he was filming The Host that one of his actresses had actually worked alongside Kim. Some of them acknowledged their indebtedness to the director, including Kim Ji-woon and Park Jin-pyo, both of whom adapted scenes of his for use in their own films. In addition to scenes from films included in the set, are clips from numerous other of Kim’s films from the 70s and 80s, as well as from The Housemaid. The directors are nicely photographed, presumably in their studio offices. Special mention must be made of the grammatically correct, idiomatic English subtitles, the best of the set.

Finishing "Grass for Sarah" was one of those big exhale moments. The process had consumed my thoughts since the morning of April 1st, and the physical labor demanded over one hundred twenty hours, the bulk of which was input during April vacation. There were lots of cuts and scrapes and sore fingers and moments of "starting over". There are at least 11 panels that did not make it onto the final piece and the frame was built three times. But all was a necessary part of the process and nuggets of ideas have been sparked for future pieces.

Les Robinson, who had already been an assistant coach for several years, was then promoted. Robinson, one of three North Carolina State graduates to coach The Citadel (Sloan and Thompson had also played for the great Everett Case), would start off the first season of his eleven-year head coaching career at The Citadel by winning four of his first five games. Three games later, his squad was still in good shape at 5-3, but it would then lose its last twelve games. Robinson would follow that up with a 17-loss campaign and two 19-loss seasons before finally finding success, with his 1978-79 team finishing with a 20-7 record and actually winning a SoCon tourney game, the school’s first postseason victory since 1961. After a few middling-to-bad seasons, Robinson’s final Bulldog team would win 18 games. He then left to become head coach and AD at East Tennessee State. Four years later, Les Robinson would finally take a team to the NCAA tournament. He would later become famous enough to have an invitational named after him.

January was crazy, you all know that and seen that in my blog posts. Blogging like a drama queen. I admit it.
With the post cut to the proper height, I set it back on top of the base board and decided how long to make the base. Using my trusty circular saw, which cuts easily through the 2″ base board thank you very much, I cut the base to the proper length. Putting the base and the post back together again, I decided that something just wasn’t right. The straight, flat edges of the base just didn’t seem to fit with what I was going for. Light bulb! I pulled out my jig saw (I told you already – power tools are fun) and made random cuts along the edge of the base to give it some nice curves. There wasn’t any real rhyme or reason for the shapes that I cut; I just cut what seemed to fit well, and the saw actually had a mind of its own a couple times that determined how deep or shallow the curves were. With the pieces cut to my liking, I began the laborious process of sanding the pieces until they were nice and smooth. I then burned the edges of the base board. (Again, if you don’t remember from my previous post, burning wood is fun and it gives the piece a cool look.) I also decided to use the torch to create a few burns extending from the edge onto the top of the base to give the base a little added pizazz. I once again held the pieces together, and I decided something was still missing. Another light bulb! I decided to use a woodburner to burn pine branch designs into the post to give my lamp an added rustic feel and to tie everything together. I spent a great deal of time first drawing the design onto the post and then burning over my sketch with the woodburner. A construction timber is definitely not the ideal wood for woodburning as it has ridges and rings regardless of how smooth it feels and how much you sand it. It also has some areas that are harder and don’t accept the burn so easily and softer parts that burn quite nicely. Regardless, I was able to create a very nice pine branch design that wrapped around the front and both sides of the post. I decided to not wrap the design all the way around the post, and instead, I chose to burn lines down the back of the post to represent rough bark texture on a tree. It’s not meant to look exactly like bark – just rough lines inspired by textured wood.

For the past few weeks Jeiel and I have been busy bringing alumni, affiliates and residents of Circle K International – UPLB together and I’ve stumbled upon Sis Katrina Viyar’s facebook account. Frankly I got inspired. Sis you should start a blog of your own as well. I had the urge to cook and bake again. Take a look at these goodies:
My goals for this year are daunting and the propensity for rejection is immense. How easy it would be to give up, but . . . I won’t. I must believe.
To offset the problem of idealized characters, many writers try to create a purposely-flawed character, such as a boozing cop or a mother who can’t communicate with her teenager, but this seems an unnecessary distraction unless, of course, it is a vital part of the character’s motivation. So many flawed characters, particularly the hero with a drinking problem, have been done to death. I know there is a long tradition of hard-drinking detectives, but there has to be a more creative way of giving characters flaws. Or not. Writers are so enthralled with the idea of flawed heroes, that they are missing the point. They don’t have to give their heroes obvious flaws. Writers are flawed. By making their heroes realistic, the heroes are automatically flawed.

After thirty-five days of traveling, It feels good to be back in the States. It’s not the longest period of time I’ve spent away, but It was my first time overseas and this homecoming feels special. Everyone changes with time but in reality, time is irrelevant. Its experience that allows us to grow. Cramming a year worth of experiences into a month has created a strange sensation. It feels like a lot of time has passed and I have returned to my old life with a new perspective.
17Today you have given witness that the Lord is your God, and that you will go in his ways and keep his laws and his orders and his decisions and give ear to his voice:
As I read the entrants list I have to laugh, Callahan, Clark, Jurek, then there's my name just a few spaces above Karl Meltzer. Let me say this right up front, I know I am in way over my head, which leads me to search for an answer to the question that will inevitably come from those who don't get it...why? In a sport (or in my case a hobby) where participation puts your better judgement into question with most folks, explaining why I would want to run this race is somewhat of a challenge. The easy answer is of course...to see how far I can push my body, or the chance to run on the most difficult 100 mile course in the country. I'm sure at some level both of these reasons play into why I am doing this, but it is somewhat more complicated than that. For the past five years my naive belief that if you whole heartedly apply yourself towards something and work at it tenaciously, success will follow has been somewhat dispelled. Unfortunately I have been reminded all to often that's not the way life works. Whether it be a career, a business venture or parenting, things haven't always turned out the way I planned just because I worked hard at them. Although I realize God allows us to experience set backs and frustrations in order to grow us and to make us stronger for what lies ahead (which in and of itself is a scary thought) that has done little to reduce the pain and disappointed of my perceived failures. On the other hand I know success, brings with it confidence and confidence gives us courage to attempt even greater things in the future. So anyway... why Hardrock? I need to remind myself that it is possible to dream big, even knowing there is no way I can achieve them on my own power. I need to apply myself totally while keeping focused on where the power comes from. In the end I need to experience the joy of knowing I have held nothing back, achieving what I set out to do and in the process gaining the confidence to begin moving forward, rebuilding so much of what seems broken.

With steady hand, we traveled to our vet for a sedated exam and a possible dentistry. My hopes were high, as recovery had not yet been ruled out. Fate quickly intervened as her vet showed me an image of her upper gum line, an image too gruesome for words. Extraordinary surgery was offered, yet with no chance of a full recovery, and painful post-op, we mutually decided euthanasia was the kindest alternative.
Anchored by strong performances from three very good actors (my personal distaste for Colin Farrell rebels at this statement, but I can't not admit it - he's good), Martin McDonagh's In Bruges is a darkly funny morality tale that's a little heavy on the plotting. I can't help but feel a little fatigued by the hit man framing, a device that seems dragged out of a dozen Tarantino rip-offs from the late 90's. But McDonagh is wise to forgo the sense of dirty glamour that most of those films purported about gangsterism, and instead sticks his pair of down-and-outs in Bruges, Belgium, to meditate on what they've done. Ray (Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) couldn't be an unlikelier couple - Ray is all brash upstart, forever wanting to go down to the pub rather than wait around for a call from their employer (a hilarious and terrifying Ralph Fiennes), while Ken is genuinely moved by the Medieval architecture and dreamlike provincialism of Bruges. But sightseeing gets put on hold fairly quickly, as a mistake Ray made on the job comes back to haunt all three men.
EPA rules are forcing the closure of coal-fired plants throughout the nation.Well, that's part of it: "Two factors have made it easier for utilities to shut old coal plants in recent years. Power demand has been weakening in recent years because of the slow economy and energy efficiency programs. And natural gas prices, which have fallen to decade-low levels in recent weeks, have allowed utilities to switch from coal to natural gas without impacting customer bills. Meanwhile, demand from China and elsewhere has driven up the price of coal."

Holden is actually best known for his short stint in San Francisco's Blue Cheer, which bridged psychedelia and heavy metal. Holden replaced Leigh Stephens, but left during the recording of the third Blue Cheer album, New! Improved! (he appears on side two only). Holden then recorded an extremely hard-to-find hard rock album as a solo artist, Population II, for the small Hobbit label in 1970 before drifting out of the music business. Most of his work, however, has been reissued sporadically by small labels in the '80s and '90s. AMG.

The underlined portion is the part that people “can say,” when they reach their U.S. Senator. That part is true. They can say those things. They would just be blatantly lying.
It's been hard to do, but I've had to say no. I can't bring myself to work for not much more than nothing, given all the additional stress and hassle which accompanies working when you have young kids. Is that the right decision? I don't know, I'm conflicted about it. Reality has slapped me in the face like a cold wet fish; I probably won't be in a position to work until the kids are old enough not to need childcare. And Smallest is only 6...

When I pulled it up on my computer, I had a very pleasant surprise waiting for me! It was some beautiful pictures that my little sister Haley had taken on our girls trip to Cannon Beach, Oregon. We went back in July of 09 and I had just found out I was pregnant with my sweet Sam. It was just me, my mom, and my two sisters that went on this trip. It was Very special to me! My mom and Haley live in Chicago and my sister Kristal lives in Seattle with her hubby. We don't get to see each other often and it was a very big deal for me to be able to go. My sweet hubby had taken off work and took the girls to the lake so I could just enjoy this very special time with my girls. Cannon Beach is a very near and dear to my heart. Me and my mama and sisters spent many Summer's there together while I was growing up.

One at a time, coat cutlets in remaining yogurt mixture and dredge in bread crumbs, pressing to adhere.
Saturday we woke and spent two hours trying to make it out of the house to do some preview shopping for the girls' Christmas presents. It's always a treat to get out of the house as a family (SMILE). Grandma met us for lunch at Panera since it was 11 by the time we left the house. Then we took off for Target. We had Toys R US and another local toy store on our to-do list, but we didn't make it (yet).
As the ultimate insult, several cast members, including LeVar Burton and Marina Sirtis, have gone on record as saying they did not like the film. Consider how tightly Paramount controls all news coming out of the trek office when considering the significance. Nevertheless, Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, and Brent Spiner have all praised the film, so there must be some virtue, right?

So I went for the money. It wasn’t a massive amount, certainly not life changing. The majority of it went to my mum, who’d been bailing me out when my earnings dipped due to spending so much time on the case. A couple of weeks later my engine blew in my car, so the rest went on a second-hand Punto. That’s the sums we’re talking about, not Ferarri territory. Not even close.
I have to say, that surprised me. I thought you would say a cafe with a comfy chair. It still boggles my mind that you can write in busy place. If you could be a character in a book, and live within their world, what character would you be?
His stare, it just continued, and he didn’t talk, he just waited as I vacillated, he knew my story I am sure, but he waited, because I had to open up. That is what this had all been about, hadn’t it? I wasn’t supposed to go to the prayer room to pray for someone else tonight, someone was coming to the prayer room to pray for me. I was coming out of this hard time in life and God was telling me “enough, it’s time to get back to work, you’ve milked that shoulder all you’re going to, so stop feeling sorry for yourself and let’s get back on task son, it’s time to get your head back in the game”.
For many educators and researchers, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (which amended and reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) was implemented in the United States to raise academic standards and student achievement through the use of state standardized testing, which plays a major role in impeding creative development. On the other hand, some educators believe that the use of standardized testing has been greatly beneficial to the education system. By providing a structure for teaching, as well as allowing teachers to evaluate their own teaching based on test scores, a standard curriculum does well in preparing high school students for higher education and the world. As well, some studies suggest that creativity doesn’t decline as students get older; it increases as students progress through high school, indicating no creativity crisis in the current education system. This is exactly the opposite of the truth.
Skied the Ravine Road trail in Westdale today - the trail surface is great for walking - packed snow, no real icy sections so a good pair of winter boots - or in my case, an old pair of x-country skis - are all you need.

Seriously though, I love that all four of my kiddos love music as much as I do; one of our favorite things to do on a nice sunny day is roll all the windows down, open the sun roof and ride around listening to our favorite songs! As happy I am that my children love music, I’m not always thrilled that they know most of the songs on the radio, especially when those songs contain lyrics that I am uncomfortable with my kids knowing. Lil Man already loves rap music, another of my influences, and unfortunately he has listened to and tries to repeat some of the more explicit lyrics that I am definitely not comfortable with him knowing.
Let me end with a simple “promise” that I have made to my kids that really puts all of this discussion about passion into perspective for me:
2) I want to assemble a battery of experts in the Biblioiblogging community grouped by expertise who are willing to volunteer time to review articles, answer questions, and talk with the press. In the past few months, I’ve been steadily compiling a group of press contacts for major news outlets and putting together a system to distribute press releases on emergent issues within Biblical Studies. My hope is to have a mechanism in place to mitigate the kind of mistaken coverage that happened during the Lead Codices debacle, and point the press towards reliable sources.

Like creative work, and creatives themselves, not all awards shows are created equal. There are shows, like the One Show, that everyone wants to win. Clios are still nice to have, although their reputation has been permanently tarnished by a fiasco that happened years ago. There isn't a creative around who doesn't like to see his/her work in Communication Arts Advertising Annual. Addy Awards are regional and national - I wonder if the person who writes their copy selling the show itself is eligible? Effie awards are given for how effective the work has been.

The true Regency Period lasted only nine years, from 1811 to 1820. Most writers of the period place their stories somewhere between 1800 and 1820; however, a few feature everything from the French Revolution to the Reform. When I am creating a Jane Austen adaptation, my setting is defined by Austen’s original story line. In my original Regencies, I tend to place my characters in situations that occur between 1810 and 1815. It is the time period of which I am most familiar.

Makes you a better player. Ok, I can only speak for myself about this, but I really think I do a lot more brainwork playing scenarios than plain bashing. And the best part is I don’t get burned so easily. After a couple of games of caster kill remembering every threat range and trick the enemy model’s can pull on me I get exhausted. But I can play 4 or 5 straight scenario games where both my opponent and myself are thinking above the abilities of the models, and it somehow makes me worry more about tactics and movement and crazy tricks with what I have there and then, than just thinking about the initial deployment for the rock-paper-scissors kind of game. I can honestly say this kind of play has made me a better player.
“As the deceased had seen active service and retired with the rank of Major on the reserve list, a firing party of Ficksburg School Cadets under command of Captain Pienaar was formed outside the church and presented arms to the coffin, which was still draped with the Union Flag. And the funeral cortège was preceded by the party at slow march with reversed arms. The interment arrangements were in the hands of the Mayor, Mr. A.A.

According to Taiwan’s Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, advance estimate for 1Q12 GDP rose 0.26 percent over 4Q11, overcoming two straight previous quarters of contraction. On a y-o-y basis, the economy expanded 0.36 percent for 1Q12, but below expectations of growth of 1 percent. The government, however, lowered its estimate for FY2012 GDP to 3.38 percent vs prv estimate of 3.85 percent on account of slowdown in export-oriented trade with China, United States and Europe. Exports are expected to grow 4.3 percent vs expectations of 4.87 percent. Inflation could also rise by 1.94 percent vs 1.46 percent expected previously. (WSJ)

That’s what this man and his organisation wants. The question is whether or not the State, and local councils, etc. act on the demands of this hater of free speech. But they have already done so! They have done so by giving EDL members harsh and silly prison sentences for burning the Koran and whatnot. They have also placed 10-year banning orders on EDL members which forbid them from protesting or even accessing EDL material on the Internet. So, in that sense, Lowles’s Stalinist dreams are already becoming reality.

This is really good with rice and veggies and/or Caesar Salad.

I asked her to tell me more about my grandparents but then my mother told me that if I want to know anything about them and her childhood I would be better off asking my aunt as she (my mother) doesn't want to talk about it - she says she can not remember her childhood at all.

Also painted this one up to. A little mushroom. You cannot see it in this picture, but I distressed the white with some distress ink. So it breaks all the white up a little and makes it look more like a fungus :0)

The thing that I still find incredible is the ability for the body to adjust itself in mid-air, in a spit second, in order to protect someone else. It is still a blur of slow motion in my mind's eye. So in order to get the art stuff done that needs to get done, I've been laying low on the typing. Hopefully it will feel 100% soon.
It may be taught that there is much to do and it may taught in the next breath that there is nothing to, but something else must be taught as well to give context to those statements, and the context is awareness or consciousness.
Bottom line piracy is bad and there should definitely be measures in place to protect copyrighted material, which is what the entertainment industry (i.e. Hollywood, media companies, etc) are hoping to achieve. But the devil is in the details. The end result is only as good as the path it took to get there. So I hope the lawmakers, politicians and legislators are able to zoom-out and take a look at the full picture before making a decision that could have a potentially crippling ripple effect on the internet as a whole.

And she always looks very, very concerned as she gets out of the bus and walks down our block.
I suppose it’s the problem with many supposed celebrities on Twitter and, to be fair, Peter Andre is far from the worst. In fact, in Twitter terms, he’s one of the more virtuous characters out there. Claudia Winkleman has 41,000 followers yet follows only 30 people. Let me say that again. This is Claudia Winkleman I’m talking about, not Elizabeth Taylor. 41,000 followers yet she follows only 30 people. The question of how she can only follow 30 people is perhaps eclipsed by that which questions why 41,000 people would to follow Claudia Winkleman. Yet, perhaps the worst offender of all is Alan Carr who is followed by 298,343 people and goes to the trouble of returning the compliment to 28. Is he deliberately trying to appear arrogant? Or is he just giving me a reason to dislike the man for something other than his vile, lewd innuendo and teeth-in-a-meat grinder voice?

My temps are just below 100 degrees, and my humidity is about 65%. I’ll let it go down to 55% before adding more water and try to keep it generally around 60%. Today is Day 19.

I used two ippity stamp sets for this one. The tag stamp is from the "Season of Joy" set and the sentiment and mistletoe is from "Kissmas and Mistletoe" set. Check out my sales blog for info on how to get these or any other ippity sets. I embossed the tag, sentiment and the mistletoe using Martha Stewart embossing powder and heat gun. The ribbon is adhesive ribbon also from Martha Stewart. The jewels are from Hero Arts.

What Jesus said to me in these verses is this: we’re either going to trust in our materialistic world, or we’re going to trust God and seek His kingdom first. We’re going to worry about our lives and our clothes and our food, or we’re going to rest in the compassionate arms of Jesus and trust God to provide all our needs.

The hospital as a whole was obviously over-staffed. But not enough of the vital staff were of a calibre necessary to create an outstanding service.

My love affair with P. G. Wodehouse and his characters Jeeves and Wooster continues and become stronger by the day. “Joy in the morning” is a real gem even from Wodehouse standards. It is the best in comfort reading and humor at the same time. There were times when I just burst out laughing while reading this book. The humor is in the situation, characters and most of all in the language that author writes.
For me, being in community means being in a safe place. It means being accepted and valued. It means having the freedom to live fully into my gifts and calling. It means being able to listen to a sermon or pastoral prayer without getting angry. It means not having to be on the defensive constantly. It means being able to be fully myself. It means being able to disagree with others in the community without losing anything. It means having my voice heard, acknowledged, and welcomed.

Overall, the candidates felt the evening was a success. The students attending might still not be sure who to vote for, but the QMU provided us with a look at the candidates up close, as it were. The potential councillors in general lacked charisma on stage, but off were pretty much nice people. The Lib Dem guy was almost nice enough to make me forget Nick “Spineless Bastard” Clegg’s U-turn on student fees.
Heat the olive oil in a saucepan that can be placed in the oven and sauté the onions and garlic until softened. Add the herbs and stir for a minute, then add the beans and tomato puree. Season with salt and pepper and mix well. Add a little water or (if used) the passata.

Now while I am sure that it didn’t all start with Dr. Richard Pan, his name is on this bill so he is taking the brunt of the backlash. Despite the numerous postings of upset parents, practitioners and even people around the globe… he does not respond, but continues to post articles as if they don’t exist. Maybe he thinks if he holds out long enough, the bill will pass and they’ll all disappear. But we’ll have to wait to see how that pans out.

One afternoon I heard a terrible commotion going on in the garden, I looked out of the window and saw Bobsy-Bob flapping her stiff black wings, screeching and rushing at ... a fox in the garden, on the other side of the fox our cockerel was crowing and strutting. The fox was greedily eyeing up the chicks, it was cool, staying just beyond the reach of the angry chooks, even sat down, waiting for them to tire ... I rushed downstairs to the kitchen and found our two dogs waiting at the back door, desperate to get out and see off the intruder - I opened the door and out they rushed; the Ridgeback, the Collie, Bobsy-Bob and Chicken Supreme suddenly all threw themselves at the fox. The smug, self satisfied look on it's face was quickly wiped off as it raced towards the hedge at the back of the garden, reaching it only inches before the dogs. From then on the dogs stayed outside, helping the hens in their vigil.
I did not. I gathered up the reins and kept Amalia under control in a canter. We came all the way through to the last obstacle and turning her to head for it she disappeared under me. It happened so fast. One moment we were almost home free and the next I was lying on the ground next to the horse. For a second I thought that she would roll over me, but she saw me and waited for me to get out of the way. I got up the same time as she did and I immediately crawled onto her back and jumped the nearest obstacle so she would not leave the hall with a bad experience. Once outside we looked her over and she did not appear hurt. To my great surprise I found that my clothes were dirty on my right side. I could have sworn that we had fallen to the left. I sure had hit my head quite badly.
Quite possibly I might love him when I start seeing my body change back into what I think is acceptable for myself. I'll let you know of course.

The short answer is "Agenda 2010," a package of reforms laid out by the government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. In the decade before these changes took effect, 5 million people were out of work (compared with fewer than 3 million now). Germany trailed everybody else in growth. It kept breaching the 3 percent deficit limit prescribed by the Stability and Growth Pact. The social-security system handed out more than it took in. So on 14 March, 2003, Schroeder went Churchill, delivering his own "blood, sweat, and tears" speech to the Bundestag. "We will have to cut benefits," he said. "We shall promote individual responsibility. And our guiding principle will be that we can only redistribute what we have earned."

“Innis and McLuhan are seen as a tandem, representing the core of what’s called the Toronto School of Communication,” Buxton explained. “McLuhan gained a lot of prominence, and then the connection to Innis was less clear at that point. So it was really trying to restore the balance.”
The ‘machine-or-transformation’ test has much to commend it. It is a neat slogan which is easy to memorize. Its application to the facts of individual patent applications appears to produce much the same outcome—so far as this technical novice is concerned—as the more amorphous, less memorable, and confusingly articulated tests that arise from a synthesis of the decisions of the European, German, and UK patent granting authorities. The worst effects of its misapplication are guarded against by the requirements that even business method patents be novel and non-obvious. Best of all, it provides an intelligible rule of thumb for business investors at the point at which they decide whether to support the commercial development of a new process or not.
I asked Matt if he’d thought about writing a sequel.
I write about business, innovation, community, entrepreneurship and development in Michigan. It’s hard to explain this to people without someone making a crack about how I must be a fiction writer. Very funny. But on Thursday I interviewed a guy who is making the world’s first commercially-available super conductor. They’ll be available by the end of the year and retail for about $10 million. And he’s doing that in Lansing. In fact, he said Lansing is one of the only places in the world where it’s even possible to do what he’s doing. A few weeks ago, I spoke with a group of men who will be helping to rebuild cities in the Republic of Iraq to the tune of $5.5 billion – from Metro Detroit. And yes, a lot of that money is going to be spent with Michigan manufacturers. If that doesn’t knock your socks off, there is a serious problem with your socks. Really, it’s these are the kinds of things that makes you go, “who needs those 537,000 people who left Michigan in the last decade? More room for us and all our awesomeness.”
Seriously, the outfit was so bad that even Mr. Rogers would have laughed.

But wait, the streets remain unplowed. Children make snow angels and build snowmen. They scream with absolute joy and throw snowballs at each other. Then, suddenly, the sun shows itself for the first time in days and I start to think, to feel really, that maybe we don’t need those snow plows after all; for isn’t it true that “if Winter comes can Spring be far behind?”

Before I end this article I must present one final alternative theory, which will throw a spanner in the works in my own theory as detailed above, as well as the research efforts of archaeologists and anthropologists worldwide. It is a theory that will be dismissed outright as utter nonsense simply because it has a biblical connotation, and also because it will imply that many age-old mysterious stone structures we see on earth today, and other evidence of ancient human existence such as tools or markings on stone, may not be from our current earth age, but a previous one. Bear in mind that Planet Earth is about 4,550 million years old!
So why would this clearly intelligent woman who has “it all” agree to help a complete stranger end his own life? She’s not a member of The Hemlock Society, although this pro-suicide organisation does take an interest in her case, in fact she doesn’t appear to have any strong feelings on the subject that don’t come out of a book and like many academics when asked a question she’s prone to respond with a quote. Or is that just a front? At her core she comes across as a Romantic. Even when she thinks about the very real possibility of a custodial sentence, this is what she comes up with:

This is the 1878 version of the finale (ed. Nowak). One can play this after the first three movements of the "1878-80" version which Tintner recorded for this series. It's a shortened and simplified reworking of the original finale of 1874. Like the 1874 finale, the "Volkfest" lacks the slow c minor section (repeated in different keys) that Bruckner added to the "1878-80" version. It's an interesting piece, but I could never prefer it over the "1878-80" finale.

The idea is that you locate all the non-watery veggies that need using up. Clean them and grate them or chop them or whatever. Spinach, chard, silverbeet etc should be lightly steamed, then squeezed and chopped. I find that zucchini can be grated then squeezed out to remove excess water. Some mashed pumpkin is good, or precooked cauliflower or broccoli. Defrosted frozen spinach can be used, too. But no tomatoes in the mix, they are too wet!

My dive buddy Dave brought over a Flander's Brown for us to brew and sadly his batch got something wild that I had in my Turbodog or we just took it off of the yeast too soon. We had acetaldehyde (green apples) in the aroma and taste. Overwhelmingly so. That batch had another yeast starter pitched into it to see if more yeast would be able to finish the beer out a bit and convert the acetaldehyde into ethanol and get rid of the green apple-y flavor. It has done quite a bit, but it was still a sour beer. Too sour. Next path to save that one is to brew it again and get it clean this time. Then I can blend with the original batch to taste. Reading up on Flander's Browns has them at a touch sour but not as much as a Flander's Red.
From Joëlle Anthony, author of Restoring Harmony, comes the teen novel The Right and the Real (Putnam), which follows 17-year-old Jamie after she is kicked out of the house for refusing to join the church of the Right and the Real and must find a way to survive on her own. In Holly Cupala‘s novel Don’t Breathe a Word (Harper Teen), Joy is suffocating from severe asthma, overprotective parents, and an emotionally-abusive boyfriend when she escapes to the streets of nearby Seattle and falls in with a “street family” that teaches her to use a strength she didn’t know she had.

Mmm, no planning application yet but once Tesco get their teeth into something like this it's very difficult to stop, especially as the council will be saving millions. There's a danger that the supermarkets could drag more trade out of the town centre but let's face it there's only one bread shop and butcher's shop left in the town centre and they close by 5pm.

We have to put up with the same yellow-green ghost effects as GhostBobby, only this time they're red (because he's evil, I guess, I dunno...) when Fred pops back to life and appears down in the basement to take care of Ted. Unfortunately, any dramatic dialogue from Fred to compound Ted's fate is negated by the fact that Turner made his voice sound like someone broke a Vocoder and dumped it into a bathtub full of lime Jello then used it to record a goat. Not exactly bringing back memories of Creepshow here, Turner.

Suspense needs a little room to breathe and the train’s massive slowness would seem to me to provide a great opportunity. It’s still going at 55, but on film, it’s never going to look like a roller coaster. What’s the premise of this film? It’s a missile the size of the Chrystler Building, right? What difference does it make if it’s not moving at the speed of sound? They can’t stop it! That’s the point.

It’s baffling A) that he thought this had a place in the book and B) that the editor didn’t gas that graph like a superfluous adverb.

I started to realise as I drove that to have a drink would not only allow the other party to really ‘win’, but much more importantly, it would also require me to lose, and lose much more than them. I had remained sober for the best part of 3 weeks and I did not want to literally piss that all away. Even if I had been strong enough to get back on the wagon the next day, I didn’t want to go back to Square One and ‘Day One’ all over again. I had those 17 or so days in my bank and I didn’t want to withdraw them. I realised all by myself that to have had that drink may well have helped me in the very short term. But in the wider scheme of things it would have cost me much more than the instant promise of release that it offered.
"When a child is doing something she's passionately interested in, she grows like a tree --- in all directions. This is how children learn, how children grow.

And the whole tree grows."

His second daughter, Jennie, may have been born, on Jan. 9, 1854, but there is some debate over what year she was born. Most biographies, including England’s Dictionary of National Biography, have her born in 1854. But a plaque commemorating her birth at 426 Henry St. in Cobble Hill says she was born in 1850. This is based on research done by Borough Historian James A. Kelly around 1952, when the plaque was dedicated. The 1850 birth date is corroborated by details in Jennie Jerome’s own memoir, in which she says her earliest memories are of being in Italy when her father was consul in Trieste, which, as stated above, was from 1852-53, before her supposed birth date of 1854.
The government claims she was a terrorist, and that they are giving her a second chance - as long as she plays by their rules. But echoes of the past whisper in Kyla’s mind. Someone is lying to her, and nothing is as it seems. Who can she trust in her search for the truth?
The outcome of the Iranian struggle thus presents a strong warning about what a defeat for revolutionary left forces could mean. As in Germany and Spain in the 1930s or Chile in the 1970s, where the fascists won the hearts and minds of the petty bourgeois, the Islamists of Iran were able to win over large sections of the rising urban masses and a feudal landlord class that feared the prospects of genuine social revolution and the consequential redistribution of their rural estates.

Two weeks before the most important violin competition of her career, she has bigger things to worry about—like growing out of that suffocating “child prodigy” label, and not disappointing her mother. But it isn’t just the wrong time. It’s the wrong guy. Jeremy is Carmen’s most talented rival, and according to her mother, he’s only interested in one thing: winning.

Currently, most of our coaches are with 5 gymnasts in Orlando, USA for the world championships. They did really well for a Swiss team, with one group coming 24/31 and the other 19/31. Incredible for Switzerland! So last week was pretty relaxed as we only had two coaches who don’t usually coach our higher group. We only ended up having two trainings in total and one of my partners wasn’t even there because she was in Berlin on a school trip! So nothing particularly hard and intensive!

A cool wind caressed the new grass. I wore shorts. I stood for a minute before heading out, soaking in the beauty. I live in a fine place.
So me + balcony + sunshine + book = recipe for a good Sunday afternoon.
We actually picked enough that Mrs. PP is making us a pie because there were enough left over even after our pick and gorge fest. I still don't understand my son though because he really likes them green (Yuck).

Corina, still a little dowdy in her less-than-fashionable clothes, but the body beneath recognised by her room mates as potential cheer leading material. Helped in no small way by an aptitude for gymnastics and an ability to contort. Lessons she'd learned as a child from her Yoga teaching cousin. Lessons that led to her being asked to pledge. There was always room for an athlete who was prepared to be thrown or fall from the top of a human pyramid. A desire for acceptance even with these bitches enables her to agree to become part of Sigma Mu. One of the more athletic sororities on campus.
This frame of mind is a fertile ground for the sinister partnership of Dr G and the Captain.
I know for a fact that I'm a lecturer to my son about listening and not expecting anything in return. But when I plea for my friend to reach out to me, and he doesn't, my feelings are very hurt. That's why I don't consider him my friend anymore. He was a friend for a season, and that makes me sad.

This achieved, I felt quite justified, because at the time, the Burg was only just pushing 71, and could actually wear and benefit from said chest piece! If I recall rightly, she wore it right up to 74. I had judiciously meted out 120 meds from my growing store, and still had a very satisfying pile left to sit on.
Stoute's comments about "polyethnicity" remind me of an article in the recent issue of Ebony about "choosing" to be recognized as Black vs biracial or vice versa. I am very much in support of people being proud and repping of EVERYTHING they are especially since historically society has pigeon held biracial people with the one drop rule. We also must remember while blood instantaneously determined someone's race simultaneously skin tone was being used as a way to create classism among African Americans. Although times have changed, deep rooted perceptions about race and skin tone still exist.
Helloooo there, it has been so long since I last posted, I must admit I have been very busy of late with Christmas coming up. I sat down today and had an idea of this cute little guy, so I set to and put keyboard to computer screen and when I finished I thought... he'll do.

Today I want to highlight an ingredient – Vitellaria paradoxa. Perhaps you might have heard of it, with it’s more common name: Shea or Karité Butter. The name ‘shea’ comes from ‘s’í’, the name of the tree in Bamana (spoken in Mali). ‘Karité’ comes from ‘ghariti’, the equivalent in Wolof (spoken in Senegal). It used to be listed as Butyrospermum parkii, but has changed recently to Vitellaria paradoxa.

This is the perfect occasion for setting aside an afternoon for a combination of fun, new exchanges and empowerment. The perfect excuse to dress up and celebrate being beautiful, being a woman—simply being you! So make the time to spend quality time with a friend, mother or daughter. If you’re from out of town why not make it a weekend to get in some pre-holiday shopping and see the city.

Keely generously invited all of us to her home one evening, for a beautiful dinner party with delicious Mexican food and other homemade treats; and we had the joy of meeting her family and being surrounded by her wonderfully artistic decor. Keely had transformed her living room into an art room, and the results were spirited and beautiful. As soon as we entered her home, we were literally surrounded by her whimsical and colorful works of art, perfectly arranged - almost like being in a Keely Gallery.

The subject matter of the book and most of the story is very interesting, but towards the end of the book, and especially with the verdict, a lot of things didn’t make sense. I couldn’t understand how the verdict could be what it was, with the testimonies presented. I felt like she ran out of things to say, and didn’t know how to continue with the story, as if the topic was a hypothetical one where she couldn’t find an answer to present to us.

Alright, apologizing for being focused on Tumblr, but I really cannot get over with the shit about the 5D Mark III and worse, the frustrations. Kidding aside, I never fit in the social groups. I always thought I was someone very, strange: Someone who cannot whistle or maybe balance a two-wheeled bicycle– that’s what made me think that I’m meant to “fall.” Well, it’s a week of suffering for all of us, but don’t make this a reason why you’re “suffering.” It’s not always suffering every Holy Week; truth is, most people go on real “vacation” rather than going to the church to confess their sins. Well, truth is, I’m not a devout Catholic. I don’t go to confession anymore (and I swear, I won’t ever confess my sins to a servant of God; like what? Ironically, why confess your sins to a servant of God if their only advice would be pray this and that if… my granny’s right, after all).

I often derided the east coast’s “mountains” and hardwood forests. The mountains are mere hills compared to the west’s skyscraping escarpments and any forest that is completely naked in the winter must be inferior to evergreen cover. I still hesitate to call the local mountains as such, but I’ve gained an appreciation for the hardwood forest in the autumn. The colors were absolutely amazing. I couldn’t stop taking photos of the firey hillsides. Again and again, I was stopped short by the deep crimson, bright orange, and brilliant yellow leaves set against an azure sky.
The little make up bag is from popular Japanese brand, W♥C (a freebie from Japanese Nylon) and is ridiculously empty. Inside is my Majolica Morjorca pressed pore compact, Hello Kitty x MAC lipstick in Big Bow and a sample of Burberry's Body. I am LOVING this fragrance! The marketing tactic of placing a sample in my shopping bag has annoyingly worked on me. So very tempted.

It had me wondering if there was some dish soap in the glass, but I've just been rinsing it out after every use. So it has to be coming from the beer, and I mean it is big. It smells like I'm about to drink a girl with too much perfume. I don't mind that, though. Been a while...

So, after describing to hubby how great you all are and making a matter-of-fact declaration that "I'm not as good or good enough to be a 'writer'," he basically told me off. But in the "stop comparing yourself to Steve Jobbs" way. And then he offered me some advice in a warm and fuzzy, supportive husband kind of way. So now, I say to me and to you, I'm a gunna stick around and see what a 34-year old, not as "learned", rough-round-the-edges, cliche-lovin', shallow (cuz I said I wasn't "deep"), ADD (that's attention deficit disorder) person-who-likes-to-write can do with and for herself.

While most of us preach against submitting directly to a publisher, there are still a few publishers who accept unagented material and will consider it. And yes, they will, on occasion, make an offer. In fact, I have four clients who came to me with a publisher’s offer in hand. In two instances the author was previously published with this publisher and decided that this time she wanted to use the offer as leverage to find an agent. In another instance the author had never been published before and wanted an agent to negotiate the finer points of the deal. In that case we sent the material around to a number of different publishers, and while we got some interest, in the end we signed with the publisher who originally offered. In another case the author had never been published before but had submitted to a couple of publishers based on contest requests. In that case we used the offer as leverage to sell the book to another publisher for an even better deal.

Honeyboy doesn’t just play The Blues; untold thousands of musicians can make the same claim. What separates him from almost all the others is that he has also lived The Blues- born in 1915 and raised in a Mississippi where slavery had become known as sharecropping, and most African Americans were still looked at as no more than chattel. He survived by becoming a musician, and along the way played with such legendary Bluesmen as Robert Johnson and Charley Patton.

Well no. Because I know I could have done better. I could have been more careful with my diet on Friday so I felt better before the start. And surely I could have made up six seconds somewhere right? In the long run I know I gave it everything I had that morning. My body will definitely attest to that. But six seconds? JUST SIX.

Lastly, I found a way to not only recycle the wooden structure of our old garden, but also to recycle the ground plot. All of the old wood timbers are in a pile in my side yard, all I have to do is trim the ends off, and I can use them for my raised beds. I just have to put in the Hugel bed, and I will be up an running in no time.

And speaking of Boxing Day, you're probably wondering how we observe it at the Evanshire. First of all, if Dave-O merely observed it, that would be about as boring as a bank holiday and we'd be in therapy. We didn't have prenups, but celebrating every small little thing was a given. As in, he knew I do when he said he do.

I also found 2 spring curtain rods in my stash that worked perfectly for this project. (had to only buy 1 more for the 2nd side of table). I placed the rod up under the table and then measured from the rod to the floor plus added 7 inches to make a top ruffle. I nipped the selvage end of the sheet and then was a brute with it, ribbing from end to end. I then ripped the front piece down the middle having 2 equal sides. I am one of those weird sewers in that I love using the knee pedal instead of the food petal. Between that and wanting more free access under the table I decided to make it in 2 sections.

Leading personal finance experts are again urging British retirees who live overseas and collect a UK pension to “seriously consider” transferring their retirement funds out of Britain and into an HMRC-recognised scheme, after it was revealed that they are losing up to £400m ($647.6 million) each year due to poor exchange rates.
In other action in Rieti LaShawn Merritt (USA) bounced back from his loss at 400 meters Thursday to record an SB 20.14 win in the 200. Likewise Asbel Kiprop (KEN) came back from his loss in Zurich to record a WL 3:30.46 over 1500 meters.

I cannot help feeling that any perspective authors looking at Choice will be continually put off by the restrictions placed on most of their packages, from page amounts allowed through to the binding on their Colour package. Even the basic package has a limitation of a minimum 50-unit book order for the author. The harder you look at what is on offer, the less choice an author will find.

I honestly do. Crafting something out of cardboard and crayons and glue and maybe even cool crap that lights up is about as zen as I get. I find it very relaxing. It is a great way to push away the world around me and focus on solely one thing. Stress leaves me and I get very happy with the idea of creating something with my hands. In current realm of all digital everything, which I wholeheartedly take part in, it is nice to stop and do something “analog.” Crafting with glue and paper is like the new collecting vinyl for weirdo blog geeks such as myself.

“KEY GAMES”
God's kind of happiness is one that is never affected by positive or negative events in our life. In today's world God's ways are scoffed at and ridiculed. I encourage you to read Psalms 19 and its parallel chapter 119. They tell us how the law and precepts of the Lord restores the soul.When our soul is restored we have joy, deep abiding joy. A joy that supersedes all life's sorrow and heartache. It is one that the world cannot understand but only observe through our life devoted to Christ.
It was just the beginning! Next evening, the female pit bull puppy was back. The poor thing looked literally “hang-dog,” as if she’d done something wrong and expected to be beaten. Once again, the young pit bull showered Sue with kisses. Sensing the dog was in trouble, Sue called local animal control for advice. After con- ﬁrming Sue’s address, they told her there had been reports of people in a nearby house raising pit bulls to ﬁght. The next day arrests were made in the case, and Sue was allowed to keep the loving puppy she named Champagne. “Champ” made instant friends with Sue’s other dogs and has grown into a gentle giant who cuddles under the covers at night and is one of the sweetest canines Sue has ever met.
In my judgment, as a matter of principle, where a defendant uses a mark without permission and thereby infringes a registered trade mark or commits an act of passing off, that act is capable of damaging the claimant's property in the mark (see s14(2) of the Trade Marks Act 1994) or property in the goodwill attaching to his business. That is so whether or not a lost sale has taken place. It is the same kind of damage as the damage to a patent monopoly caused by an infringing sale which is not a lost sale to the patentee and for which a reasonable royalty is payable. It is an invasion of a (lawful) monopoly. Thus there is no reason in principle why damages should not be available, calculated on a "user" basis for trade mark infringement and for passing off. Of course it will be a question of fact in any given case to decide the amount of such damages".
Thank you for your patience
I like the early Gibson and Stephenson for what they are. They used science fiction somewhat differently than other people did, and were a little more grounded using our current reality as a point of departure (or rather the 1980′s/90′s reality). Many of these stories while steeped in techno geek paradigms keep some of the sensibilities from the pulp science fiction wierdness that Philip K. Dick so popularized. More importantly though they carve their own path. One of the awesome things about Philip K. Dick was not that he was predicting the future, but the entire future he created revolved around a number of eccentric conditions that may never possibly exist. His main character conflicts are something that could only happen in a Dick novel, but at once can be seen as a distorted mirror for aspects of our own strange trivialities. This is why I love PKD, but cyberpunk I enjoy in a completely different way. Like in a comic book geek way, as opposed to a 19th century literature way. I can like both.
"Most public policy is based on offering people incentives and disincentives," Berns says. "Our findings indicate that it's unreasonable to think that a policy based on costs-and-benefits analysis will influence people's behavior when it comes to their sacred personal values, because they are processed in an entirely different brain system than incentives."
It just goes to show what can happen when you keep your eyes open for creative opportunities and possess the tenacity to come up with work even without a brief.
Although fairly insignificant, Col. Kline holds a distinction that Rudolph Guiliani must loathe -- Kline is the last mayor to hold an additional elected office after leaving City Hall. (He became a U.S. representative for a single term.) Keep in mind this significance; in the early days of New York, the mayor's seat was a mere stepping stool to a host of elected jobs. Kline seemed to take that stepping stool with him when he departed on the first day of 1914.

So get off your chair, put your hospital gown and stethoscope down, and head on over to the cinema to enjoy what will hopefully become a sci-fi classic before it leaves the big screen, and see if you laugh as hard as I did at Kirk's line as he is being choked by the Romulan.
My last couple of articles talked about building relationships and how to effectively develop the important relationships in your life. In one of the articles I spoke about communicating and how our current generation is communicating more than ever via facebook, twitter and text along with a plethora of other social networks. there is nothing wrong with this other than it becomes easy to be bold behind the shelter of a keyboard and computer screen. this next series of articles will cover communication and how to be engaging in person.

If our behaviour like Freud said is governed mostly by the unconscious mind, it would mean a lot of the decisions I make come from a hidden place that I am not aware or mindful of. And with that comes the need to blame others for my failures, insecurities, fears, disappointment and hurt. It is so easy to.

I would discriminate even among the Muslims as well. Somebody from Hizb Al-Tahrir comes, and says: “I want to marry your daughter,” or somebody from the Muslim Brotherhood or one of those Salafi-Talafis, says: “I want to marry your daughter”, I’d say: “Yeah? You’re in terrorism.” – I’ll show you terrorism. Don’t touch me. What are you talking about? – I would marry my daughter to somebody who is Sunni. So everybody discriminates based upon their own religious belief. Otherwise, why would you say that your religion is the truth, if you didn’t discriminate?

I’ve been doing lots of soul-searching trying to figure out myself and what I want in life. Looking back at the last several years, I’ve seemingly accomplished a lot–work and academic-wise–yet I feel a sense of emptiness.

So why take them? Because “even though these stimulants inhibit our epiphanies (and sicken us with addiction), they seem to dramatically increase other kinds of creativity.” It all boils down to pleasure. Amphetamines act primarily on a network of neurons that uses dopamine. Dopamine plays a major role in the brain system that is responsible for reward-driven learning. A sense of pleasure is the brain’s way of telling you, “Hey, Stupid! Look over here.”

I don’t think I was the only one who was shaken up some. As soon as I showed up, Lakkara became pretty emotional and teared up…it took her some time to pull herself together. Greatmother stepped outside so the two of us could have some time alone. Mostly at first I just let her talk. She pretty much repeated what she’d said in her letter, filled in a few more details here and there…I held back and tried to give her room to contradict herself, and listened the best I could for any holes in her story. Nothing I could see.

Of course, it helps that we've had some great movies previously that have introduced us to these characters already. We already know Iron Man, Thor (and Loki), and Captain America from their solo films. Because of the ingenious steps taken in plotting this out in advance, we know a lot of the components, and Whedon isn't burdened with introducing us to the characters all over again. The screenplay just dives right into the characters, which is refreshingly bold.
Strangely enough, sometimes you do not notice you are good at something until someone tells you so. While you may have realized what your special traits and talents are, you come to recognize more exceptional qualities you possess when hearing them from another point of view. At times you would come across unsuspecting remarks and uncalled for words of praise that would come from a friend, family member, or a stranger. A usual reaction is, “…but I didn’t do anything,” implying that what you are doing naturally in turn unexpectedly affects others – one more hint pinpointing you in the right direction.
And now for a little audience participation: What's your favorite thing about shark week? What's your favorite kind of shark? Have you ever eaten shark? Has a shark ever eaten you? How did that make you feel? Discuss.
I asked my roommate for a suggestion on supernatural mani and since I'm not very good at free hand nail art I gave her all my stamping plates and asked her to choose a pattern for me.

Last week I returned, not to the county of my birth, but to the county of my growing-up: Warwickshire. In terms of castles and stately homes, the county has an embarrassment of riches, including Warwick Castle, Charlecote Park, Ragley Hall, Baddesley Clinton, Coughton Court, Upton House and Kenilworth Castle. This last is a ruin; having been a fortress palace of great importance for many centuries, used by monarchs from Henry II to Henry VII, and famous as the place where Robert Dudley played host to Elizabeth I for an exceptionally long visit (19 days) in 1575, it was then ‘slighted’ by the Parliamentarians during the Civil War – and descended gradually, thereafter, into a fully ruined state.

Airlines resumed flights to most of southern Chile airports on Thursday after they were briefly suspended because of the high concentration of ash in the atmosphere.
Quite why this is so shall be the focus of what follows, but for now suffice it to say simply this: post-cuts politics needs to be much more robust in making a positive case for the legitimate and necessary role of the state in creating and sustaining that very society that both traditions outwardly claim to be seeking.
That’s okay as well.

It was now about 3 am & the rain was pelting down but there was no alternative but to keep on working. Daylight came along & Fritz commenced shelling the Cross in earnest, so at about 6 am we were ordered to leave the guns where they were & return to the camp. This we did arriving back at 11.30 am fagged out & as hungry as owls, having had nothing to eat since 5 pm the previous night. Had breakfast & to bed for we were to return to the Cross at 9 pm. Had sleep, some tea then out once more, arriving at guns near midnight.

I am not saying all contests are the same and therefore not valuable but am merely talking about the recent frenzy where the prizes have no bearing or relevance to the company, or product, and the contest itself does nothing to build customer engagement with the brand. Most importantly when you throw the kitchen sink by emailing people randomly, it becomes akin to a marketing bribe where in order to receive a LIKE; rather than trying to target a relevant audience and do it on the merits of your brand or product story.
I just took off my flippies, inked up the bottom of my foot just like you would a child's & stepped on the cardstock.
We can learn three things from the globalist-run “KONY 2012″ propaganda campaign that is now viewed as an epic disaster after its creator went berserk in public and smashed his fists on the pavement while naked. One, viral political films must be treated with deep skepticism and caution because their creators are not the final authority on truth and reality. Second, if discredited politicians, journalists, and organizations promote the film then it is likely that the political cause the film is pushing on viewers is not egalitarian and just. And three, the massive recognition and popularity of a political film is not an indication of its objectivity, sincerity, and authenticity.

Certain geographically limited urban areas with majority Muslim populations were recognized as Autonomous Cultural Zones. Here, local councils were allowed to pass certain supplementary laws in accordance with the cultural demands of the inhabitants. As these areas all had Muslim-majority councils, this was essentially a rubber stamp for certain Shari’a legal provisions to be introduced without having to make the nature of the concession explicit. Provisions introduced included the prohibition of the sale or consumption of alcohol or pork products and a strict dress code which prohibited the wearing of T-shirts or other ‘revealing’ items to men and women alike. Though ostensibly enforceable by the police via on-the-spot fines, in practice the police presence in these areas dwindled from little to nothing in a matter of weeks. This allowed local Muslim enforcers to step well outside the newly established boundaries, demanding far greater adherence to the Shari’a than had been legally mandated. In combination, these developments drove virtually all non-Muslims and significant numbers of Muslims out of these areas.

She is likely to run a campaign based on her own high profile locally, recognising that the party and Gordon Brown are unpopular in Barking. Local activists will look to shore up her support by concentrating on the anti-BNP vote rather than attempting to win back Labour voters who have defected to the BNP. She will also have to deal with the fact that six per cent of BNP voters in her constituency are non-white.

Then some summer I hit upon Dogsbody and I know I did other things that summer, but I don't remember any of them. Because I read Dogsbody back to back six times. I still remember laying on my bed -- on a hot, muggy, thunderstorming Virginia afternoon -- closing the last page of the book, sighing, and then flipping it back over to the front to read it again, not even getting up to stretch my legs.

It’s not too late to start – sit down with your folks and outline a clear job description, then lay out some goals, and then GIVE FEEDBACK!! A leader who only praises and never corrects isn’t challenging their people enough. Be brave – most people like feedback.
It also takes them an average of 31 days for food to pass from ingestion to excretion … amazing! And yes, their body temperature CAN fluctuate up 8 degrees over the course of a day. And the respiratory rate can range between 6 breaths per min to 120 !
And there we have a problem. Co-codamol has never been much use, the recently increased dose being more than countered by increased pain levels, especially in my hips, knees and hands (and it is indicated for less severe pain than DHC). In fact, the first time I got even moderately effective pain management was after I left APH with a supply of DHC (as I’ve explained, this was more effective than DHC Continus). I don’t even get the constipation I get from codeine, with DHC, and it has zero effect on my breathing. To the best of my knowledge – and I do pay attention to these things – I get no side-effects of any consequence from DHC, which I can’t say for Co-codamol.

More than any other sport, baseball has been a hugely integral part of New York's identity, and yes, the Team From the Bronx is largely responsible for that, but the Mets, Giants and Dodgers were and are also part of that identity too (I've touched before on what makes the Mets distinct from their crosstown rivals). But what if New York remained a one-team town after the Giants and Dodgers left?

It’s only when the hard times come that our passion is tested and when there is real passion there, when we are motivated by our most deeply held values, we will push through the dip. The hard times can still be really tough, we might come close to quitting but in our heart of hearts we know we have to go on, to do what it takes.

But first, curd. I tried making a traditional curd using the Chinottos I spoke of earlier and the result was, frankly, vile; so bitter as to leave a dry, rasping sensation on the tongue that somehow only bananas took care of. This might have something to do with the variety, otherwise known as Citrus myrtifolia, which provides the essential component in Italian ‘amari’ - specifically the aperitif Campari. So I hatched a cunning plan. One cup (250ml/½ pint) of bitter orange marmalade loosened with the juice of a sweet orange to which I added one heaped cup (250ml/½ pint) of creme fraiche mixed with sour cream (but use what you have). This concoction was then boiled to buggery – if you’ll pardon the expression – for about three minutes. It firms up in the fridge, which takes about an hour. It’s undeniably ‘false’ curd, but I have to say the results were not too shabby. It has a similar consistency to ye olde version and feels clean and bright in the mouth. Omit the shred if you want something smoother.
Anything else. Madam? Well, yes.
He also acquires a magnificent black horse named Destiny, who reminded me slightly of the old Champion, the Wonder Horse TV shows, which were still being repeated on Saturday mornings when I was Sam's age. I can't remember much about them now except for the theme tune ("Champierrrnnnnnnnnn, the Wonder Horse...") and the fact that the excitement promised by the title sequence (all indians, stage-coaches and galloping horses) was never really delivered by the show itself. The Cowboy Jess books avoid this pitfall with carefree ease; they are all indians, stagecoaches and galloping horses. For older readers they may not have the same depth or scope of Geraldine McCaughrean's longer books, (and clearly aren't meant to) but they are still well worth reading, if only so that we can marvel at her nimble storytelling and the brilliance of her language (at one point, when dawn breaks after a night on the range, she describes a band of light appearing along the horizon 'as if the sky was lifting its hat to a lady'). For boys and girls who love adventure they are just about perfect. Order them now and encourage a bit of half term/summer holiday reading.

Here we’re just on the other side of the peaks surrounding La Paz to the south. The view is looking back along the road coming out of the city, which sits behind those tall cliffs. If you click on the above photo to get the higher quality view, you can see how deep cracks have been eroded into the cliffs by the rains that pound La Paz from about November through March of each year.
And in doing so, CrossFit gave me my indpendence. My backbone. CrossFit, and running the box, taught me to take care of myself, and my business, with a focus I never knew I had. CrossFit gave me the realization that I don’t NEED anyone to do anything for me. I’ve got this. Every workout you guys do…Every new member who joins our ranks…Every class we have…reminds me…I have done this…I can do this…and it just keeps getting better.
