That leaves Oregon officials to find savings by reducing payments to hospitals and managed care organizations, wringing more efficiencies from its programs or reducing the services covered.
If Maryland's bishops are indeed so deeply concerned about religious freedom, why is it that they seek to deny that freedom to religions like mine? If, as they write in their statement, "religious freedom protects the ability to practice any faith," why do they seek to exclude from state recognition marriages performed not just by Unitarians, but by clergy of many faiths who would unite all loving families in the bonds of matrimony?

Q: How do you build a $1.2 million digital projector system on $2,300?
Judges are most definitely different. The last thing we want or need in California is trial judges who sit on the bench with one eye on justice and the other on how any particular ruling is going to play with the public. In other political offices, decisions are expected to be popular, almost by definition, and when a politician takes a courageous action, well, there's a reason we say it's courageous: It may end his or her political career. But as much as we would appreciate the luxury of a bench full of unusually courageous judges, we know that they are human and would be subject to political pressure if we didn't build into the system enough independence that they can preside over cases without seeing each big-moneyed litigant as a potential donor or each losing lawyer as a revenge-seeking challenger.

Mr. Wallace: What made the McCain idea interesting to me, was that I'd seen a tape of his appearance on Charlie Rose at some point the previous year, in which he spoke so candidly and bluntly about stuff like campaign finance and partisan ickiness, stuff I'd not heard any national-level politician say. There was also the fact that my own politics were about 179 degrees from his, so there was no worry that I'd somehow get seduced into writing an infomercial.

There are many reasons why they're not, the biggest being the absences of Jay Cutler and Matt Forte because of injuries.

But Jacobs was already established with the fashion cognoscenti as a "cool brand," and he rebounded, setting up Marc Jacobs International in 1993 with his business partner, Robert Duffy, and relaunching his own collection.

We had chosen the Cotswold Way, one of Britain’s well-maintained National Trails, because the region of rolling hills and charming villages has been designated an “area of outstanding beauty” and because it has an excellent infrastructure for walkers.

So the latest Quinnipiac poll shows that Florida Republicans are still sweet on Herman Cain (27 percent), with Mitt Romney in second place (21 percent) and Newt Gingrich gaining ground (17 percent).

Opening the show with a fairly strong take on "Eyes Wide Open," a dreamy Peter Gabriel-style number that hails from last year's "Making Mirrors," Gotye would lose steam in a hurry.

I’m not saying there’s a good time for Rutgers to venture into the heart of SEC country for a game, but if you had to choose at date, the week after the Razorbacks play defending BCS champion and bitter rival Alabama isn’t a bad one.

The second inning wasn’t any better: Four more hits, three more runs. Before most of the crowd had settled into their seats, there was a new pitcher.
Meir, who invites survivors to speak in his Holocaust classes, says he then helps students "unpack the presentation" as they would any primary source or literary text. Understanding personal testimony on its own terms involves thinking about the speaker's intentions and the context in which it's offered. And personal testimony needs to be corroborated with other sources, he says. In his classes, when the Aigners are speaking, students are surprised by how closely their accounts line up with those of other sources.
"She was the last person who lived here full-time and operated it as a cattle ranch," said docent Sarah Murphy, who notes that the property was sold in the '60s to reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes.

After raising their family in Phoenix, the couple moved to California to be closer to their daughter, Barbara. Betty and Dennis have two children, eight grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
Top-notch production values also contribute in a vivid re-creation of Collins' vision. Early scenes of the downtrodden District 12 have a Dorothea Lange quality to them, with drab clothing and drawn, emaciated faces of common folk stuck in an Orwellian nightmare. They dramatically contrast with the Capitol where the games take place, a weird variation of Oz awash in vainglorious people wearing bold colors and gaudy costumes.
His focus would be disclosure for a federal system that is opaque. Donors are identified in unwieldy monthly or quarterly filings. Some donors who give in October may not be known until after the election. Some will never be known.

Nickell's study for the state panel assumed that PG&E had run the line within a much narrower range of 350 to 400 pounds. Periodic fluctuations within that range, he wrote, wouldn't have put enough stress on the line to destroy the defective weld.
Police were suspicious enough that they took a DNA swab of one of the men, Juan Chavez, and logged in his saliva as evidence. Chavez was released without being charged, and vanished.
Starwood faces new competition for high-end hotel guests and residents. In about two years, Park Hyatt plans to open a new hotel a few blocks away in the lower floors of a luxury condo building that is under construction by Extell Development Co.

“He just got better and better,” Vaughn said. "He can be a pure point guard when he wants to, but he can put points on the board, too. He goes right at you. Not a lot of flash as a ballhandler, but he knows where he wants to go and figures out how to get there.”

The author, an award-winning poet, has severe food allergies, to dairy, egg, soy, mustard and shrimp, just to name a few. Although the book is filled with scary tales of allergic reactions in far-flung locales, it's also funny, touching and ultimately courageous. After all, how many of us can say that we place our lives in our forks each and every time we eat?
Factories were among the first businesses to start growing after the recession officially ended in June 2009. The manufacturing sector has grown for 27 straight months, according to the index.

Instead of the classic look of multiple overlapping layers of cinched satin, reminiscent of the Disney princess gown, the ball gowns this season feature an embellished neckline or bust with beading, and the colors veer into the bold and bright for a neon princess look.
Head about two hours south of Washington and you can enjoy a visit to Bryce Resort in Basye, Va. It's a family-friendly ski resort made even more so with their SKIwee program for toddlers, which separates the youngsters from older children and adults. For those who enjoy other activities, you hit the trifecta here because you can play tennis in the morning, golf in the afternoon and ski in the evening. An active ambassador program over busy weekends and holidays has members picking up guests with a golf cart to ferry you to the main lodge.

Vitaly starts with a traditional recipe, then takes it apart, asking how to make it more than just "different." "I see people do food different for the sake of being different," he says. "I put thought into every dish to make it a whimsical play on a classic. I want to bring back ideas hundreds of years old in a different form in the hopes that we can say at some point, we have a Northwest cuisine."
The club has lost six consecutive playoff games, including the final two games of that series. Three straight DNQs (did not qualifies) followed the '04 first-round loss, and after losing to Vancouver in a four-game sweep in 2009, the Blues DNQ'd the past two seasons.
F. Francis Najafi's column about anti-immigration sentiment took the wrong slant (Arizona needs to undo its anti-immigrant image," My Turn, Tuesday). Americans and Arizonans, in particular, do not take issue with immigrants. We, indeed, value their contributions to our economy and culture. My grandparents emigrated from Ireland and operated a grocery and a hardware store.

But the 29 other clubs might have at least 58 outfielders better than Austin Kearns and some of those clubs are going to be out of contention sooner than the Indians.
What McLaughlin did with these stripped-down tools remains one of the great achievements in 20th century American art. Ignoring accepted rules, his sophisticated paintings pry open perceptual space. Almost surreptitiously, they grab hold of your optical apparatus and undermine conventional habits of seeing.
The original story in Brian Selznick's book is strictly serious, but the movie for reasons of its own has chosen to add a major slapstick element that does nothing but misfire. This problem coalesces around the character of the station inspector, greatly expanded from the book and played by Sacha Baron Cohen in a manner both weirdly menacing and slightly risqué that clashes with the rest of the film.
NOISE COMPLAINT, PEKIN ROAD: Friends talking after 1 a.m. April 8 bothered a man who called police.
In early March, Megill limited Virginia's Steele Stanwick, the 2011 Tewaarton Trophy winner, to one goal, and two weeks later harassed Johns Hopkins top attack, Zach Palmer, into a pair of turnovers with just one garbage-time goal.
The award hinges on the state legislature releasing the $117 million in aid money that Gov. Chris Christie said he would agree to over the summer.
He should be proud. Vargas was part of a Washington Post team that won the Pulitzer Prize for covering the breaking story of the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. He is a good storyteller who, he is quick to point out, had a reporting life before coming out as undocumented last year in an essay for The New York Times Magazine.
"Ohio is 32nd in the nation in breast cancer incidence, but fourth in breast cancer mortality," she said. "These numbers are even worse in minority and under-served women.
If an election is held in the middle of the fiscal year and voters reject the taxes, programs that rely on state funds could face chaos.

Coos County: A large portion of Coos Bay is open to hunting even though some of it is within the city limits of Coos Bay.
On his own, Miller tried a range of popular strategies: He broke the school into more manageable groups of teachers and students. He created time for teachers to plan lessons together. He opened a parents' center and partnered with corporations and foundations that sent money and dozens of mentors to take the students on field trips and college visits.
But the federal role in assuring medical care for millions of Americans was already extensive before Congress passed health insurance reform this year. And despite all their saber rattling about dismantling the law, surely Republican leaders don't have the support, the will or the better ideas to change that.
Cleveland knows the drill.

“As far as my personal experience, I do better when I eat a higher-protein meal before and after a run than if I carbo load,” Camerlinck said.
Sixteenth Annual Holiday Candlelight House Tour
Articulate, charismatic and genuinely heroic, Nasheed proved an ideal documentary subject for Shenk, best known for co-directing "Lost Boys of Sudan." Not only does he always say what's on his mind, but he granted Shenk and his team unprecedented access to the kinds of insider meetings and conversations that are usually strictly off-limits for the media.
On the campaign trail, Mr. Santorum has begun to boast of winning three times more counties than Mr. Romney so far. But Mr. Romney's strength among less ideological urban and suburban voters explains his sweeping victory in Maryland, and points to his perceived strengths in the other contests this month in states that follow the heavily populated I-95 corridor from Delaware to Connecticut.
The least risky deals are those in which you arrange a firm reservation at a firm date. Agencies that deal almost entirely with hotel and resort accommodations -- such as Jetsetter, Spire, SinqueAway and Vacationist -- typically arrange confirmed reservations on fixed dates. Potential problems with these deals are minimal. I've found, for example, that hotels generally give guests on big-discount deals the least they can within the limits of the contract. That means you're likely to get the least attractive rooms and locations rather than the best.
"I never made a commitment that somehow we were going to give carte blanche to large-scale producers and operators of marijuana," he said. "I can't ask the Justice Department to say (to federal prosecutors), 'Ignore completely a federal law that's on the books.'
The Nationals learned Saturday that outfielder Jason Michaels will likely return to the organization and report to Triple-A Syracuse. The Nationals released Michaels on Thursday but hoped he would choose to come back should he not find a major league contract.

In return, the university would have upwards of $1 billion to sink into its endowment. The university would then match that amount through the UO Foundation's private fund raising.
Eclectic is the way one employee described the store, drawing artists and craftspeople for its wide variety of materials. Crates of gourds -- small and dwarf -- fill one spot of the store while a rack of rattan poles occupies another. "We have hundreds of martial arts customers,'' Widess explains.
Kirkpatrick, who sits on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the attention to the border is justified. "The risk of violence spilling into Arizona is clearly there. I am not going to wait for that risk to become a reality or for that problem to come to us," she said.
We could tick off so many names of coaches who were egregiously careless with the truth—and put their programs at serious risk—that it actually isn’t funny at all. Some of them, like Jim Tressel, lost their jobs. Some, like Chip Kelly, didn’t. Others, like Pete Carroll, just got out of Dodge.
U.S. Sen. Scott Brown declined to comment yesterday. The Massachusetts House of Representatives is expected to take up a number of sweeping changes to the EBT program as early as today.
Lance Lynn's shut out bid took a bruising in the fifth inning, and it was a familiar one. Brewers outfielder Corey Hart, who was questionable for the series after knee surgery a month ago, slugged his third homer in two days to put the Brewers on the scoreboard. Lynn has six strikeouts through five innings and he's outlasted Wolf. The lefty allowed three runs on nine hits through five innings.
In addition to Giffords, Loughner is accused of shooting 18 people, killing six and wounding 12. All survivors have been released from hospitals.
The film also makes no attempt to dig into Lewis' life away from the spotlight. A couple of his sons are interviewed, but they only talk about their father as a performer. There's no discussion of Lewis the family man. There's no discussion of such health problems as crippling back trouble and heart attacks.
Transportation Security Administration officers who went to look at a camera that should have recorded the security breach in Terminal C on Jan. 3 realized it had not been working for six days. U.S. Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg (both D-N.J.) immediately called for continuously functioning and continuously monitored video surveillance, as well as additional security layers to compensate for human error, such as electronic sensor equipment.
For those who knock Blackmon because he lacks elite speed, Jackson says: "I hate to say this on the record, but I will. Arguably, the best receiver in football is Larry Fitzgerald and he's not a blazer.

Customers bought 1,023 Chevrolet Volts, compared with 603 in January, as GM seeks to recover from the negative impact of the government's now-closed investigation into two post-crash-test fires in the electric vehicle's batteries. Rising gas prices likely won't increase Volt sales, said Citi's Michaeli, since the Volt costs $39,995, before a $7,500 tax credit.

On Monday, April 23, 2012, a couple arrived at the Jersey City City Hall parking lot for the sole purpose of paying their taxes -- even though the property tax rate in Jersey City is highway robbery, and escalated into oblivion, initiated and approved by the Healy administration. They found the means, no matter how overbearing, to pay their May 1, 2012 tax payment early.
Kirt Linneman, executive director of the Maryland chapter of the Center for Bio-Ethical Reform, an anti-abortion group, said that while he believes all abortions are immoral, women who seek them should receive adequate care.
They ask why he doesn't wait until he takes his seat on the board, when he can help change things. They wonder if he will work cooperatively with other elected officials. Or will he run to the media every time he's on the short end of a vote?
I will be moderating an invitation-only Money Smart Week Kickoff breakfast panel on Friday that includes Michigan State University economist Eric Scorsone; Paul Traub, business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago Detroit Branch; Gabriella Barthlow, a credit counselor and owner of the Alpha Advisory Group, and Jeffrey Taylor, a certified college planning specialist for College Funding Resources in Southfield.

"We teach members to use common sense and to understand that these platforms and the comments that you make will be seen," he said.
"You really learn what's essential and what is expendable," she said. "What is essential is love. What is essential is faith. What is essential is forgiveness. What is expendable are buildings."

Madigan's reputation as the political grandmaster looms so large, supporters say, he's often suspected of maneuvering behind the scenes when he's not. But in the opaque world of Illinois politics, direct connections are often elusive and state law makes it difficult to sort the public interest from private agendas.
"We're walking and drinking. Is that OK?" said the 25-year-old resident of the lower Haight. All the Peeps were wearing yellow underwear, she assured a passer-by, and some of them would assuredly be giving a peep show, "but you're about an hour too early."
Added Kathryn Klaber, the president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition: "We remain hopeful that the DRBC will move forward with common sense regulations aimed at responsibly developing clean-burning, job-creating American natural gas in the region. The vocal minority calling for less energy development are simply ignoring the American people’s basic needs."
"Clearly, they both have financial interests," White said. "There are things we are not going to do. But we have met the obligations we were supposed to meet."

Two of these children are unable to appear on camera. They’re represented by their parents because they were driven to suicide by persistent taunting, a situation that is every bit as disturbing as it sounds.
Police supervisors say the two programs give recruits a worthwhile experience while they sometimes must wait weeks to months for a basic academy slot. In the past, Portland recruits could get stuck answering phones or doing desk work, not considered constructive work for a new hire eager to learn the ropes of policing.
Mohammed Tayeb Agha, an aide to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, met with U.S. officials at least three times in spring 2011. He was also in communication with bin Laden, who was looking for assurances about what kind of haven al-Qaida’s senior leaders would have in Afghanistan after a U.S. military withdrawal.

And the community could be another step closer to having a bustling, rejuvenated section of downtown with the critical mass of people needed to attract new restaurants, retail space, offices and residential units to the empty storefronts and mid-rises along Euclid Avenue.
It was. But even the best officiating crews are helpless against the tide of fights, cross-checks and hits to the head overwhelming some otherwise very entertaining hockey. They arent getting much help, either, from league disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan, whose decisions grow more bizarre with each incident. Shanahan, another former Wing, began by letting Nashvilles Shea Weber off with a $2,500 fine  roughly the cost of one shift  after the All-Star purposely smashed the head of Detroit forward Henrik Zetterberg into the glass at the end of Game 1 of their series. Then he suspended Chicagos Andrew Shaw and New Yorks Carl Hagelin (Michigan) for three games each after both hit opponents without obvious intent during the run of play.
Portman, sitting immediately to Fisher's left at a conference table, countered that some states have recovered better than others, but that Ohio under the current governor and lieutenant governor is "in the top 10" for unemployment.
"It's a constant work in progress," she said, acknowledging she loves improving the home.
Part of that stems from the Rams' own decision to give up a home game in agreeing to play the New England Patriots in London. That's listed as a home game but we know better than that. The Patriots are very popular in England, and if anything this will seem like a home game for Tom Brady and teammates. In essence, the Rams will have nine road games this season and only seven home games.
TRENTON — Gov. Chris Christie says he had to renege on a campaign promise to New Jersey firefighters not to touch their pensions in order to save their pensions.
However, The Bee previously identified some officers, and based on the context of the disciplinary actions, the two former wing commanders  top officers of the 144th  received severe penalties.
The real irony for McKenzie-Jones is the history she shared with one of the women found buried on Sowell's property. She said she used to hire Janice Webb as a baby sitter when Webb was 18-years old. That's part of what makes this awful story so intensely personal – and infuriating -- for her.
"Those are three things that, no matter how much you work with goalies, you can't really teach them. I've always had a lot of faith in Ryan, and he's been keeping us in some tough games. Hopefully, we can start giving him some more help as we try to make our way into the NCAAs."
To be sure, flying or buying booze isn't a basic civic right. But it doesn't take an imperiled fundamental right to galvanize activists in any other arena. There's even an ambitious and well-connected movement to ensure that poor urban residents don't live in "food deserts" underserved by supermarkets. It's simply inconceivable that those focused on civil rights would somehow overlook the threat of demanding IDs to cash checks, buy booze and — oh, by the way — get into the Washington offices of the Justice Department, which frowns on photo ID laws, if these rules really imposed a serious unequal burden on classes and ethnic groups.
Christopher Moss, 19, was being driven to a downtown Oakland jail when he escaped from the back of the patrol car near Seventh and Jefferson streets about 7:45 p.m. Monday, authorities said.

As the morning began in a Newark courtroom, U.S. District Judge William J. Martini denied a motion made Tuesday by agitated prosecutors who sought — in a passionate, last-minute motion — to introduce evidence, including a tape recording, that allegedly shows Bergrin trying to arrange the murder of witnesses in other cases.
The court administrator, Colleen Massey, said it should be a boon to procrastinators or defendants from out of town. "People wait until the last minute," she said. "Or they can't decide if they want to pay it, or they can't come to court."
Ken Dobbins, the president of SEMO, said that renovating the science labs has been one of the school's highest priorities. While the grant money will not cover all of the university's needs, it will help, Dobbins said.

“Every organization that has an involvement with children should have open transparency and full disclosure when it comes to the abuse of children,” Morey said.
"I'm not comparing what's happening to the workers in Madison or in Columbus to Hitler and Stalin," he said. "But I am saying that history teaches us that unions are a very positive force in society that creates a middle class, and it protects our freedom."
Our small plane lifted off from Pearson Field and burst through the heavy cloud cover to emerge into a sunny sky. It was almost immediately apparent to the pilot and me that something unusual was occurring -- St. Helens' snow-covered cone was darkened as if by a cloud. Minutes later, as we drew closer, we realized with wide-eyed excitement that we were witnessing an erupting volcano; a crater had opened, steam was venting and ash was drifting down the pristine, white slopes. Best we could tell, we were the only ones in the air. Because of the low cloud cover, no one on the ground could possibly see what we did.

I have cruised the South Pacific, the Atlantic and the Mediterranean on the most luxurious ships afloat and have been crew on sailing and racing sailboats for decades in inland lakes, the Great Lakes and the Caribbean. As a volunteer on a tall ship, however, I knew I'd have a rare chance to learn classic skills and be part of a genuine adventure. I was leaving private staterooms, spa treatments and five-star table service far behind. Now I would sleep below decks in a narrow bunk, stand watch, eat shoulder to shoulder and scrub the galley afterward; it sounded grand.

But Mr. Hinton had come under increasing media scrutiny because, in 2007 and 2009, he told a parliamentary committee in the U.K. that the company had carried out a full investigation of the phone-hacking matter and found that just one journalist was involved—a statement that turned out to be wrong.
Regardless of whether "Obamacare" is repealed or modified, Americans are doomed to pay even more for the cost of treating obesity-related illness if the weight epidemic is not addressed. And unless we're willing to respond to the timely wake-up call that is "The Weight of the Nation," many of us - and many of our children - will pay with their lives.
One day I really wanted to make fish, for a plate of something fresh and simple, but I didn't like the thought of fishy pans in the bathroom. So I wrapped tilapia fillets in foil packages with a squeeze of fresh grapefruit juice, a knob of butter, fennel fronds and plenty of salt and pepper. I placed the packages on a foil-wrapped baking pan in case the juices leaked.

For "Dark Shadows," an eccentric vampire romance starring Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green, he has staged a minor one-man rebellion against CG imagery.

Born worked with Pritchard, but left the Knights shortly after Buchanan arrived to take a job in the NBA Development League. Buchanan and Pritchard became inseparable. They shared many of the same beliefs about the importance of character, evaluating talent and building a winner. The job would last only a year -- the ABA suspended its season and within a year had folded -- but when Pritchard was named director of player personnel for the Blazers roughly a year later, he hired Buchanan and Born as scouts.

Honestly, I was hung over from an Italian meal the night before and the many bottles of red that had gone with it. But the father came out of the cellar with a dusty bottle in his hand. It was one of two that he had left. I thought, "Wow, I never knew anything could taste so good."

In addition, the Blazers continue to be a difficult bunch to count on. Some nights, Roy has his mojo; other nights he is stiff and ineffective. Some nights, Miller looks like a crafty veteran; other nights he looks like he's past his prime. And it has become futile to rely on any Blazers outside shooter to be consistently on target this season, leading McMillan to coach on "feel" not only on a nightly basis, but a quarter-by-quarter basis.

And in leaving the Republican Party as he did, criticizing it as equally to blame for political dysfunction, he essentially left his colleagues behind, harming Republicans running for office. Does this demonstrate a Marine's loyalty? If his principles and positions are still the same, could he not have preached against political gamesmanship and practiced civil politics from within the party?
Chris Carpenter's status is uncertain as the team seeks to find out if persistent soreness in his neck is a nerve-related condition.

Since then, consumer and business confidence has been sapped by a raft of bad economic news: lawmakers in Washington fought over raising federal borrowing limit, Standard & Poor's downgraded rating on long-term U.S. debt, the debt crisis in Europe worsened, and the stock market tumbled in late July and early August.

Uriel, on the other hand, is a sort of brainy pop-culture star of Talmudic studies, appearing on talk shows, publishing book after book in what his father sneeringly dismisses as a career based on shortcuts, not tireless work -- a charge Uriel doesn't exactly deny. Uriel knows how his father feels about him, and one suspects that in a less proud man the feelings would be more hurtful and wounding. He clearly loves his father, but it is a rocky relationship between two headstrong men, neither of whom has any interest in giving an inch -- in anything.

We know he has the ability to get the job done."

Now, this wasn't easy. It should have been easy, but it wasn't. But in the end, we got members of both parties to come together and make sure that you could keep more money in your paychecks each month. And you're keeping that extra $40 in every paycheck because we made sure that we didn't stunt the recovery. We made sure that families got the break that they need. And that means more security for your families. It also means a boost for our economy at a time when we've got to do everything we can to keep it growing. Because more money spent by more Americans means more businesses hiring more workers.

With such a lean agenda, filling even 41 days has been a challenge. House Republicans are now devoting full floor debates to bills such as H.R. 2087, "To remove restrictions from a parcel of land situated in the Atlantic District, Accomack County, Virginia." That issue -- allowing development on a 32-acre property -- was so crucial to the Republic that lawmakers had five roll-call votes on the topic.
It was also reminiscent of similar gatherings at the homes of former OSU coach Woody Hayes and Earle Bruce after they were dismissed. This march included signs that read, "Thank You Jim," and "You're in Our Prayers" and "We Support You Jim." Several fans wore Tressel-specific T-shirts of support.

Kickers usually dismiss any implication that a timeout would affect their kick. However, the researchers found home-field advantage, distance of the kick and a player's experience did not have an effect on the kick, so there appears to be something to the research.

The email was sent to the account tressel.3@osu.edu. That is the same address Columbus attorney Chris Cicero used to email Tressel in April 2010 about OSU players selling memorabilia, an email that Tressel did not disclose to his bosses, an NCAA violation that eventually led to his May 30 resignation.

Mark Parker sent an e-mail to Nike employees yesterday about the report. Mostly the usual yada yada yada, though I thought I might as well post the note. There are some interesting details -- for instance every team "will have tailored corporate responsibility strategies fully integrated into their business strategies in 12-18 months." "Corporate responsibility" is now being dubbed the more Orwellian-sounding "Innovate for a Better World." And then there's the fact that apparently, many Nike-ites don't shut their computers off at night. Tsk tsk.

It is Michigan's ugly little secret: We are second in the world in the number of juveniles we sentence as adults.

Hey, John: I can't speak to the USGA's thinking process and I'm sure Webb Simpson -- the unfortunate player to whom you referred -- can't either. I agree the rule in question -- Rule 18-2, section B -- is a bit harsh.

But with Metro-style apps, you won't find a close-program "x." You won't even find a menu bar. Instead, to close a program you have to move your pointer to the top edge of the screen, click and hold until the app screen becomes a thumbnail and then drag that thumbnail image to the bottom of the screen. And you have to do all this without any clues: there's nothing to "grab" at the top edge of the screen and the interface gives you no indication of what you should do with the thumbnail once you've grabbed it.

When the debt impasse is resolved, the postmortems on the role of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor -- and the impact on his political future -- will make for interesting reading. Cantor clearly annoys Democrats from the president on down. But despite Speaker John Boehner's insistence that they're on the same page, also seems to grate on other Republican leaders, too. He pulled the rug out from under Boehner last weekend when a grand bargain seemed with reach, then poured cold water on McConnell's effort to defuse the confrontation. This doubtless plays well with the Tea Party wing of the GOP, which Cantor was courting even before last fall's Republican takeover and which regards deal-makers like Boehner with suspicion. It's assumed on Capitol Hill that a Boehner-Cantor showdown is simply a matter of time, and the past few weeks have done nothing to diminish that belief.

Indeed, it is hard to overestimate the extent to which the ECB has been able to call the shots over the past two years. Ever since the ECB reluctantly agreed in May 2010 to launch its Securities Markets Program to buy Greek government bonds—ostensibly as a monetary policy operation to lower domestic interest rates—it has been drawn deeper into the crisis. The ECB's bond-buying has given it the power to dictate policies to member states, blurring the line between fiscal and monetary policy. It has used this power to demand the deep structural reforms and fiscal austerity, most notably when it punished former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's government for backpedaling on reforms by refusing to buy its bonds, eventually forcing him from office.

The case: Batiste of Sacramento filed suit after claiming she was harassed and abused - and eventually menaced by a gun-wielding collector - after she fell behind in debt payments. Court papers indicate she borrowed $68,065 from American General Finance, securing the loan with a 2003 Ford Mustang and 2005 GMC Denali. The company claimed she never made a single payment. The delinquent debt went to collections and the Mustang was repossessed. Batiste, who is African American, accused one alleged AGF representative of using racial slurs and vulgar language "as well as a threat of violence" to locate the second car. According to the suit, fliers were distributed in Batiste's neighborhood with her full name, offering a cash reward for information leading to the current location of the Denali. At one point, the suit states, a man with a handgun confronted her at her second home in Las Vegas, seeking the second vehicle.

* And that's OK. Let me explain what I mean by that. I've suggested that Kroenke engage in diplomacy by offering Rams fans at least some degree of comfort that he wants to remain here and is willing to work hard with the St. Louis CVC and area politicians to come up with an acceptable lease agreement at the Edward Jones Dome. Kroenke has made it profoundly clear that he has no interest in engaging in such posturing. He views this as a cold, calculating and hardball game of negotiation. He's taken a pass on the public-relations game. He won't play it. I know this will sound funny to some of you, but at least there's integrity in that approach. Kroenke refuses to tell St. Louis fans and media what we want to hear.
Guard officials called the removal of a former California adjutant general in this fashion unprecedented.
Presumably, this story has a happy ending. Very few, if any, of you will ever see the nightmare form in question. But the larger lesson remains that you need a passport for almost all foreign trips, that you may encounter unexpected obstacles when you first apply, and that the application process could take a lot longer than you'd expect. So unless you plan to stay home for the rest of your life, make sure you have a current passport. Even if your latest passport has expired, an old passport is usually enough to get you a new one without further hassle.

He certainly grabbed our attention after a 44-point performance against Bradley earlier this season — look it up on YouTube — but this is something McDermott is capable of on any given night if the opposing team doesn’t have a strong presence in the post to slow him down.

Optional: Process sealed jar in a boiling water bath for 15 minutes. (After reading complaints on the website where I found the recipe that these pickles got soft after the water bath, for my first batch I simply flash-boiled the jar in the water for about 1 minute. The top did not seal -- which is OK with a vinegar-based process; any spoilage is obvious -- and after cooling it overnight, I placed the jar in the pantry to await readiness in 8 weeks.)
