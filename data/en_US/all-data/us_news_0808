Fans of Suzanne Collins' best-selling young adult novel should be thoroughly satisfied with the faithfulness of Gary Ross' film adaptation, though the book's brutal violence has been softened to earn the movie a PG-13 rating. Jennifer Lawrence ("Winter's Bone") is an ideal choice to play strong, independent teen heroine Katniss Everdeen, who is thrust into the middle of the annual Hunger Games, a brutal, fight-to-the-death competition involving teenage girls and boys in a post-apocalyptic North America. Ross maintains a sense of tension and immersion in this dystopian world, and though it runs nearly 2 1/2 hours, "The Hunger Games" never drags. Rated PG-13; violent themes, disturbing images. 2 hours, 22 minutes. By Christy Lemire, Associated Press.

Pixar, the matrix of the filmmaker's prior triumphs, has been notable for its stable management, and for a collegial atmosphere in which warm support combines with brutally honest exchanges of ideas. In recent years Disney, the show-business behemoth that now owns Pixar, has been riven by managerial upheavals, and has never been accused of collegiality. This new Disney film, marked by myriad lapses and marketing follies, bears the woefully familiar earmarks of a big studio production that was pulled and hauled every which way until it lost all shape and flavor.

Ravens DT Haloti Ngata vs. Jets C Colin Baxter: Regular center Nick Mangold isn’t expected to play, so he’ll be replaced by Baxter, a rookie.

As a work of informational architecture, the cloud inspires awe. It materializes in the blink of an eye, like a flash mob at a Mumbai train station. Hovering above digital firewalls, the cloud can store and transmit the sum of all human knowledge — the Bhagavad-Gita, Einstein's general theory of relativity, Kim Kardashian's top 10 mani-pedi parlors — to your laptop, your smartphone, your tablet (iPad, that is — not stone). It's the online equivalent of a giant safety deposit box. Its inventors and worshipers compare the cloud to a public utility, like the water department, that will connect users around the planet, allowing billions of people to touch-screen their way to personal fulfillment and communal enlightenment. Ownership of mere hardware will become passé. What matters will be sharing — Lady Gaga tunes, PhD theses, DIY videos of demonstrators being clubbed in Athens' Syntagma and Cairo's Tahrir squares.

But just as much, regardless of the records, the Buckeyes finally want to take care of the Badgers in their own territory, which even Mike Conley and Greg Oden couldn't do four years ago.

Prasino ✭ 93 S. La Grange Road, La Grange; 708-469-7058. Downtown La Grange's newest arrival is a 200-seat, eco-focused restaurant where the food is organic, the wines bio-dynamic, the lights made from recycled materials and the wood trim reclaimed from a demolition.

Oversharing of personal information: "If you're a supervisor, you shouldn't be doing it, period. You just don't say, 'I had a really hot date' or 'I'm worried I'm putting on weight.' But if it's peer to peer, you can say, 'I really respect you, but I'd like to keep work work and keep the personal stuff personal.' It can get uncomfortable. In an extreme situation you can say, 'I'm not trained to discuss this so maybe you should talk to someone who is.'"

Two years of concerted legislative work on the regional mass transit issue — an effort headed by high-ranking legislators, on the orders of two governors — ended with a whimper.

But Rowling seems determined to be the wellspring of outside-the-text facts about Harry Potter's world, which cuts off the kind of imagining that is usually left to readers. Some readers might have seen Dumbledore as gay; others might have viewed him as quirky and without a particular sexual identity. Both could be "right," but with her post-publication pronouncements, Rowling has limited our possibilities. On Pottermore, Rowling may provide an imaginative experience for the site's visitors, but it's really her imagination, not her visitors'. This will make readers' roles more passive and less creative.
Denton is also shrewd enough to take note of the class factor that Greg Mitchell highlighted in his account of the 1950 senatorial campaign, "Tricky Dick and the Pink Lady." Chotiner was at pains to contrast not only Nixon's staunch anti-communism with Douglas' suddenly suspect liberalism but also the difference between Pat Nixon and the Democratic nominee -- "suburban housewife versus clawing professional. While Pat was the quintessential homemaker, keeping the hearth fires burning for the family, Helen was the ruthless elitist who had abandoned her children and husband in her unwomanly ambition and grasp for power."

As an ordinary citizen of Maryland, I thought that the first priority of a session of the General Assembly, especially in challenging economic times, was to pass a balanced budget. It seems to me that the early days of the session were focused on a same-sex marriage bill. Gov.Martin O'Malleythrew his full weight behind it. The Democratic establishment pulled out all the stops.

For romantics who embrace the snow (tire chains required), the 102-room lodge offers a moonlight snowshoe to stargaze, check out the night wildlife and then sip a cup of well-deserved cocoa afterward. This natural-wood lodge, built in 1999, with a cozy dining room is more upscale than the usual national park digs. But the real draw of this lodge is the breathtaking Sierra setting and its proximity to the big sequoias in Giant Forest and Crescent Meadow (also a good spot for snowshoeing amid the mammoth trees) -- oh and the romance of being out in nature. Along with the guided snowshoe hike, the Romance Package includes dinner for two and chocolate truffles. Rates start at $209 per room per night; if you miss Valentine's Day, the deal is good through March 15.
Judge Alsup's ruling won't have sweeping legal implications because it was limited to a group of Wells Fargo customers in California, said Charles Delbaum, a senior staff attorney for the National Consumer Law Center.

It's a pleasant enough place, airy, not-quite-elegant and trendy in the way mall shops tend to be. But its simplicity and the way it fits into its upscale neighborhood obscure the challenge of creating its very specific look. In this case, the job fell to Roth Sheppard Architects, a firm that has created everything from Vesta Dipping Grill restaurant to the Room & Board retail store to the Denver Art Museum gift shop.
In what has become an annual spring event, Glenn Stewart, an expert from UC Santa Cruz, examined the baby birds and determined the genders: three boys and a girl. Stewart placed bands on the falcons' legs and collected information about their health and nest conditions.

The one central truth on this issue that is never mentioned in any of these discussions is that the generation of people now beginning to collect Social Security and those who will do so in the next several years loaded the trust fund with an astronomical amount of cash for nearly the past half-century and provided the foundation for comfortable retirements for two generations of beneficiaries.

"We hate that Brooklyn hipster thing where people aren’t moving in the crowd, they’re too cool to dance and just stand there with their arms crossed," DeAngelus states. "That’s not why we do this. When we’re on stage, we love what we’re doing and we love rocking out. We’ve been doing this a long time, I met Graham almost 12 years ago, so it’s a long time playing in a band with someone doing basically the same thing. If we didn’t love it, we definitely wouldn’t be doing it.”

There is no device that allows for Cap (Chris Evans) to be in full on superhero mode. We pick up right where we left off. Cap is still reeling from what he's been through and Whedon resisted the desire to make him full on Captain America. He's tough, but he's still dealing with the shock of his time travel and is humble about what he can do.
These bleak figures point to the danger of losing a generation due to the prolonged downturn in the economy. Teens are competing with adults for whatever jobs they can find.

Amid the good news was some sobering observations from Mooney. While industrial and manufacturing customers are doing well, they're not in any hurry to hire.
2. Lavonte David, Nebraska, 6-0, 233. His lack of size will turn off some teams, but he is a tackling machine. David is a smaller version of Ray Lewis and plays with similar intensity. He is a very explosive hitter and has excellent short-area burst. He is tough and athletic and plays hard. David shows good technique but sometimes gets bulled at the point of attack.

5. Flip the pancakes and continue cooking until the center feels lightly set when you press the top with your fingertips, about 2 minutes more. Adjust the heat of the griddle as needed so the pancakes cook evenly. Keep the pancakes warm in the oven until all of them are cooked. This makes about 16 pancakes.
Several courthouse sources said that would happen today.
Cinghiale's menu now makes it easier to make discoveries, like the deceptively humble Toc in Braide, a polenta dish that Marucci changes up each week with prime ingredients like imported cheese, black truffle oil, white asparagus and even snails.

BETTY ANN MORICLE, 74, Orlando, died Friday. Baldwin-Fairchild Funeral Home, Lake Ivanhoe Chapel, Orlando.
Bears general manager Phil Emery says he's targeting ‘‘about seven players'' for the 19th pick of the NFL draft Thursday. I'm not quite well-versed in Emery-speak yet, but my intuition tells me it's his way of giving us something to chew on for a few days. In other words, it means little to nothing.
The merger takes effect April 2.
The Indians want to monitor the innings of starters Justin Masterson and Mitch Talbot. Reyes, if he has no setbacks, gives them that option.

GTx is now testing enobosarm in two trials, each involving 300 patients with non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer and frequently comes with severe cachexia. Steiner expects results in 2013 and, if all goes well, predicts the drug could be available at the beginning of 2014. He envisions enobosarm being prescribed not only to treat cachexia but also to prevent or delay the wasting.

He seemed to step up his game when it mattered most, catching 17 passes for 303 yards and five TDs in his last two bowl games. While Blackmon isn't the fastest receiver in the draft, he has the strength and the moves to create separation at the line of scrimmage and get open. He has excellent hands and catches pretty much everything thrown his direction. He also excels at leaping to catch passes without breaking stride and isn't afraid to go across the middle of the field to make plays.
A: Royal made some big plays on special teams, including an 85-yard punt return for a touchdown last year. He signed with the Chargers as a free agent. But even if he had re-signed with the Broncos, they still would have been looking for help on special teams. That's because Royal primarily is a wide receiver, and he has battled injuries throughout his NFL career.
So far more than 88,000 people seem to be upset. That is how many people have signed Dompierre's online petition asking that the MHSAA do the right thing and make sure students such as Eric are permitted to participate in athletics during all of their four years of high school.
Buchanan spokesman Max Goodman said in a statement that "there is absolutely nothing new in this report. Every allegation was painstakingly reviewed and unequivocally rejected by the FEC." Goodman called the report "a disgrace" that "relies exclusively on the contradictory testimony of one unreliable and thoroughly discredited witness" — the ex-partner.
A vanishing and mysterious phenomenon, concentrated on the western alluvial slopes of the Sierra, spans much of California's Great Valley. Vernal pools. We most often hear about vernal pools in relation to the "endangered" fairy shrimp, and I was always slightly annoyed that such a big deal is made over something we can barely see.

Now, the ugly.
Should President Barack Obama win re-election and Democrats regain control of the House and keep their Senate majority, the political fight would be over, but the legal issues would remain. Should Republican Mitt Romney, who vows to repeal Obamacare despite its similarity to a law enacted in Massachusetts when he was governor, capture the White House and the GOP keep the House and register such a huge victory in Senate races that it's close to 60 votes, Obamacare and its legal issues are dead.

When I first heard about the murder in Paris, a downstate town I'd never visited before, I was intrigued not so much by the alleged crime but by the reaction of the community. Lots of people were convinced that Terry Payton, 16, who was accused of killing his mother, was more of a victim than a criminal.
Pizza on two visits was disappointing; the crust didn't have much character and was a little limp. It's surprising because the kitchen does such a great job with the bread, served with Dry Creek Olive Co.'s tangy, spicy oil. On one visit, the pizza was topped with broccoli pesto and sausage, with only three nuggets of cheese on the entire pie ($15). On another, the tomato-sauce-slathered top was dominated by sausage and olives ($15). Next time maybe I'll stick to the simple Margherita ($13.50).

Of course, New England went 14-2 and the Texans 6-10, but we're not talking about won-lost records right now. The question is whether Henne and Miami will shred the Texans' secondary as they did the Patriots.
Owner Bob Klein touts the heritage polenta, or, to quote the menu, the "Italian heirloom whole-milled Floriani Red Flint corn polenta" ($4.50, with varying toppings at $7-$9). The creamy yet grainy bites have an amazingly complex texture but were held hostage by salt.

In a nutshell, here's the logic: In the last 25 years, the U.S. average price of gasoline has risen 33 percent to 55 percent between the second week of December and the second week of May, Kloza said. That translates to an increase of 98 cents to $1.64 over today's national prices.
The festive decorations inside a sold-out Powell Symphony Hall, the long lines for intermission snacks and the family party atmosphere all conspired to give the impression that this was the place to be these few days before Christmas.
One California union appears comparatively bulletproof: the California Nurses Association. Its members average nearly $90,000 in annual pay. It has the power to disrupt hospital operations by staging one-day strikes, as it did Tuesday at seven Bay Area hospitals operated by Sutter Health.

Michael Bailey ran for Congress in 1992 in Indiana. The National Right to Life backed him. Bailey ran 700 graphic anti-abortion ads on local television. He sued the FCC over its decision that local TV stations could channel such ads. He had run some of them during Saturday morning cartoons. His theory was that children would demand an explanation from their parents.
"Snooki fit that mold very well," said Kassee, 22, a senior from Jersey City. Students lined up early in the afternoon to secure one of the 1,000 wristbands to get into the 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. shows, which featured Snooki being interviewed by comedian Adam Ace. The event was called "Inside the Nicole ‘Snooki’ Polizzi Studio" — a play on the name of the cable television interview show, "Inside the Actors Studio."
I'm a simpler-is-better kind of cook, though, so for my first try I decided to cut through the clutter and simply put the turkey on the grill on its back and leave it at that. It worked perfectly. Two hours later, I had a gorgeous, mahogany-brown smoked turkey. No muss, no fuss, no bother. Why complicate things?

Maybe the zoo feels like home to Ben because there's a depressed grizzly bear that mirrors his sorrow and a gorgeous ailing Bengal tiger that reminds him of his late wife. There's also a shaggy human menagerie, including comely zookeeper Scarlett Johansson, conveniently unattached, and her lovely niece, Elle Fanning, conveniently the right age for Ben's son, Dylan. Almost seamlessly Ben moves from being the guy who tried to save his dying wife to the guy who tries to save a financially strapped zoo.
In the past two games, he's moved second baseman Jason Kipnis from the No. 7 spot to the No. 2 spot and dropped Asdrubal Cabrera into Choo's No. 3 spot. Kipnis had two hits and an RBI in Friday's 3-2 victory over the Angels, while Cabrera drove in the winning run.
Still, as fab as she looks and sardonic as she sounds, Lindy is bipolar, and skipping her pills. She says it's because of, well, the side effects, but it could also be because she doesn't really need pills -- she's married to one. Or maybe being mentally unbalanced gives her life the buzz it otherwise lacks.
But it is for Overbrook that he remains a bit wistful.
M did recover. She also had her (healthy) third child, and now has a fourth. She still battles with diabetes. She did call me ... months later and we cried on the phone over those many years back. Of the pain I'd caused her in one of the hardest times of her life.

"I am in a very blessed position because the people who read my novels range in age from 10 years old to 100. When I sit down to write a novel, the first question I decide is 'What are the ages of the characters who are falling in love?' Because that will inform dilemma," Sparks says. "People enjoy books about people their own age because they can relate to them.

The airline sells more fares than it has seats on your flight. Someone’s got to stay behind, and that someone is you. You might be entitled to cash compensation. If you’re bumped from a flight and the airline rebooks you to arrive an hour or less from your original arrival time, there’s no compensation.

Before investing his life savings in the goat dairy, Drake carefully penciled out the economics, but he soon found that he had underestimated the costs. Part of that was bad luck, since drought conditions in Texas caused the price of hay, which accounts for half of the cost of production, to triple over the last several years. Electricity, labor and taxes are also much higher than in Utah, so it costs 2.3 times as much to farm here compared with the home ranch, he said
Lincecum has given up more runs in the first inning this season (nine) than he did all of last (eight). Halladay had only been nicked for one run and seven hits total in home wins against Pittsburgh and Miami previously.

øBut there are those in the industry who say the good stuff is getting gunked up. "Like a lot of these platforms, in the beginning, it's great because only cool people use it, so all the images are cool," says Carley Roney, editor in chief of TheKnot.com, who estimates that six months ago, 75% of Pinterest's wedding shots were pinned from her site's 50,000-image library. "Then they get inundated with marketers."
"I just felt like it was the right time and I was ready and it was the best decision for me and my family," Wroten said during a conference call. "I accomplished a lot and I'm ready for the next step."
But Assistant County Prosecutor Rick Bombik suggested, over Parker’s objections, that the defense could have requested further testing on the items if they thought it was necessary. But they did not make the request.

Joshua Tree National Park covers nearly 800,000 acres. No matter the time of year, you'll enjoy it most in the day's first and last hours of light, when the shadows get interesting and temperatures change fast.

The more simple the ingredient list, the more wholesome and unprocessed the food will be.

When kids control the timing and content of their own reminders, they feel independent - and that lets you relax.

Excluding the fact that Evans was miscast as the Kings' primary ballhandler during his first two seasons  and that's on former coach Paul Westphal  almost everything about him has yet to be determined.
