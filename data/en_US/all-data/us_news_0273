I think we had 21 phone lines and they were all lit up, he said. I think we had five people on the phones and there she was sitting at one of the phones. And we literally could not keep up with the business. In fact, we had to open the box office at intermission, there was such a demand from people who had just seen the first fact. They were literally lining up at a closed box office at intermission.
--RW Joel Ward was the first player to speak to reporters after his high-sticking penalty led to the game-tying and game-winning goals for the Rangers. "We're a few seconds from winning and it turns into an overtime loss just like that," he said. "It's a little mentally disturbing when you're in that position and let the team down."

Finding myself three aisles ahead of him, I retraced my steps and found him in the baking-needs aisle, calculating the difference in price per ounce on a quart of vanilla from the tiny bottle I had picked up. I assured him that I'd never use a quart of vanilla in my whole life and we moved on.
The lawyer, A. Ryan McGuigan, says the warrant shows the FBI is looking for weapons, but McGuigan believes they're looking for paintings stolen from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in 1990.

Comments: Born in London, Crawford moved to the United States in high school with basketball as his primary sport and didn't play football until his junior year. He is considered to be skilled and athletic but extremely raw.
The problem for Jimenez continues to be his inability to throw first-pitch strikes. He struggles to get ahead of hitters, and it frequently results in him falling behind in the count, which leads to longer at-bats, more pitches and more chances to make a mistake pitch, which frequently gets hit. That was the case again Wednesday night.
"Making it more costly to do business in the forest puts pressure on jobs," said Bob Mion, spokesman for the association. By easing the regulation, he said, the bill saved rural jobs at a time of high unemployment.

Those dreams disappear as a result of Mark's short fuse — an argument over bruised egos and disputed land that ends in a death. An uncle is jailed, Mark goes into hiding and Nik's life is suddenly on the line. The plot turns on a 15th century code still practiced in Albania today that gives a murder victim's family the right to take the life of the accused, or in his place, another male in the family. The one caveat is that home is a safe haven, with Nik becoming one of the countless boys forced to live inside while the feuds drag on.
"We share in our owners' investment, and the trade-in value benefit extends this partnership from the initial purchase all the way through what we hope will be the consumer's next purchase of another Hyundai," Krafcik said in a written statement.
Lawmakers proposed some of the most restrictive abortion bills in Arizona's history.
At Mount Tamalpais State Park, the vibe is very different. The park is reached by driving up, down and around winding, hilly roads, and on a sunny Saturday morning in spring we dodged, by my count, 29 fast-moving mountain bikers. Mountain biking originated here in Marin County; the cyclists I observed tended to blow through stop signs, just as they do in St. Louis.
"I'm asking you to do the right thing," Adam Epstein, 15, told members of the House Health and Government Operations and Judiciary committees in a joint hearing. "Please help us who are suffering."

The maids in Kathryn Stockett's "The Help" are expected to do as they are told without complaint, use separate bathrooms, and cook, clean and polish silver for about $1 an hour. So how do these fictional black women in 1962 Mississippi find a measure of independence?
Across from the surfer-friendly Java Beach Cafe at Ocean Beach in San Francisco is the newly transformed La Playa Park. Converted from a neglected space that formerly attracted drunks and the homeless, the park has become an oasis, complete with an organic edible garden, a meditation path, a bee habitat, and now - two well-designed bocce courts of degraded white granite.
U.S. Attorney Joe Hogsett told The Indianapolis Star that federal investigators are trying to figure out how broad the case is and that victims or their families should contact the FBI if they recognize Finkbiner from the mug shot.

The Browns will most likely pursue a receiver in free agency, and there are some good ones available even though Philadelphia's DeSean Jackson, Buffalo's Stevie Johnson and Kansas City's Dwayne Bowe either re-signed with their teams or were franchised.
But having company in this is no comfort. That's why Oregon's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, in which physicians and pharmacists closely track drug flow, and efforts to fully warn patients at the pharmacy pick-up window are essential to a better understanding of addiction risks. Still, more conversations are needed in those places, in homes and between doctor and patient.
Theisen took care of that Friday on Gilliam’s more tightly-configured 200-meter track, burying not only the all-time collegiate best she put up in January, but also the official record of 4,496 set by Arizona State’s Jacquelyn Johnson in 2008.

Firm revenue dropped a combined 12 percent in 2009 and 2010 before flattening in 2011 at $323.5 million. But even then, its workforce of lawyers declined last year by slightly more than 6 percent, according to the American Lawyer, a trade journal. And while its revenue level ranked 88th among the largest 100 U.S. law firms, its profits per partner, a key economic indicator, ranked 99th.

Scientist and conservationist Birute Mary Galdikas, founder of Orangutan Foundation International, said orangutans are among the most intelligent animals. Orangutans in the wild, where Galdikas has studied the apes for more than four decades, routinely use tools to scratch themselves, swat insects and create simple shelters. In captivity, Galdikas said orangutans have demonstrated remarkable creative-thinking skills, specifically in their ability to escape enclosures.

One person happy to be back on the mound was Monday's starter, Joe Blanton, who said the elbow injuries that limited him to 11 appearances and eight starts last year are behind him. He allowed two earned runs and three hits in 42/3 innings. Blanton threw 63 pitches - 45 for strikes - and said he has a clean bill of health this spring.
As for the hot sauce, instead of red harissa, I wanted the North African green sauce called chermoula -- a pesto-like mixture of hot chiles and leafy cilantro (called green coriander elsewhere), kicked up with garlic and preserved lemon. And although chermoula is often paired with fish in Tunisian cuisine, it tastes good with chicken and any number of other things.

No doubt, she said, her Christian life has sustained her through it all.
All five recipes are easy and relatively quick to make, especially if you do a little prep work before heading out for your night on the town. One recipe even has an added advantage - the dish called San Francisco Little Joe's is a variation of a classic called Joe's Special, a scramble of eggs, beef and spinach that San Franciscans swear can help prevent a hangover.
"We'd been looking to build our own headquarters for several years, and this is a good location," Oliver said. "Our employees are spread from Chesterfield to Illinois, and this is a central location with good highway access and good local amenities."
Outgunned, undermanned, and with vast swaths of land in Cochise County accessible by nothing but trails and dirt roads, Sheriff Dever faces an impossible job. Undaunted by rugged mountains that make our San Gabriels seem gentle, endless scrub and countless arroyos, Dever's mission statement reflects the challenges. It includes a quote from Winston Churchill:
Take gook bab, called beef-rice soup on the menu, a humble-looking soup of beef bits and vegetables, meant to be combined with rice at the table. She puts high-quality short ribs, center heel shanks and tendon into it, and simmers them for hours. The daikon is cut on a bias, just the way it was done in the old country, she says. Those fascinatingly textured bits of meaty vegetables? That's Korean taro stem. The soup is deep and clarifying.

Bernstein said it had been an emotional week, inspiring conversations about “competition versus art.” Still, Bernstein said her son is already talking about what solo he might perform next year.
Kyle Cassity scored five points, and in the past six games, he's alternated scoring and not scoring. His 3 in the first half came after Richmond had missed a 3 that would have tied the game. Cassity then came down and hit a 3. It might be my imagination, but it seems when Cassity does score, it's a big basket. Or maybe his baskets just stand out more. He was +4 in 15 minutes.
Another problem, jury consultants say, is that jury boxes don't represent the jury pool, compromising the right of defendants to be judged by their peers.

The home opener, instead, was a reminder of the painful 2011 season. The Rockies were outclassed by the Giants in every facet. Jhoulys Chacin couldn't throw strikes, the Rockies committed multiple errors for the second time in three games and the hitters were constantly lunging at the off-speed pitches thrown by Giants left-hander Barry Zito.

The more they talked, though, the more Barone realized there was a wealth of material from that project that could be included in a gala reissue project. “The album captures one show (from New York City’s Bottom Line) but we performed all over the world, and a lot of those other shows were recorded too, especially in Berlin and Paris” Barone explained. “And those other shows were quite different, with different songs and improvisations. So that was one thing. I made demos of those songs for the musicians, and they’re quite different and quite unique, and no one has ever heard them before.”

Under playwright D. W. Jacobs' direction, Fuller comes across as an engaging man of enormous mental energy and unflinching dedication to free thought. He has a quirky sensibility as well that mirrors his mind's quicksilver movements. While Tompos resembles photographs of Fuller (with a little John Malkovich thrown in), his strongest link to this man who considered himself a guinea pig in a lifelong experiment to benefit humanity is apair of glasses.

Karen Sykora learned the trick in 1997 for a regional in Syracuse and has been using it ever since. When her beloved Tar Heels are in the NCAA Tournament — anywhere within a reasonable distance from her Allentown, Pa., home — she doesn’t go to the box office, or StubHub.
Fans of other sports have had their eras in St. Louis, sometimes with spectacular results like the Super Bowl-winning Rams, but they all seem kind of transient by comparison. The football Cardinals arrived in 1960, and after several consecutive seasons of 4-9-1 and a few exciting years in the 1970s, bailed out in 1987. The St. Louis Hawks NBA franchise moved to Atlanta in 1968, right after the Blues came to town and claimed the winter sports niche. The Spirits of St. Louis tried to revive professional basketball, but that failed pretty quickly.
The mayor said he hopes the borough can solicit bids for the project this summer. The plan is available at Borough Hall for public viewing during office hours.
"We expect a lot," Blade said. "The kids expect a lot out of themselves and have high goals and expectations for the program. Fortunately, that has been able to carry itself over from year-to-year. We are fortunate that the kids believe in that and the families buy into that. The kids have done a great job over the years putting in time to be competitive, but I am a competitive person and, hopefully, that makes its way down to the kids."

He had all kinds of stuff he wanted to get finalized, but he wanted to do it in the work session.
"A few of us who had been active in the election were dismayed at the way the campaign was handled. The primary was a vicious one, in which intemperate remarks of Republican candidates created havoc within the party. From some offices, the Republican candidates elected in the primary were of such unimposing stature that most Republicans found it difficult to support them enthusiastically. Large sums of money were wasted, and some substantial contributions for future campaigns were seriously antagonized. So, licking our wounds, a group of us resolved to try and do something about the sad situation. We would not repeat these mistakes, and we would try to take constructive action that would lead, not only to unity within the Republican Party, but to the development and election of superior candidates to public office."
"It doesn't take too much to see we're a little banged up," he said. "Still, guys are competing. Less experienced players are jumping on opportunities. The better part is you don't see any 'woe is me.'" And that can happen."

House Speaker John Boehner, Republican of Ohio, began Wednesday by ordering his fellow Republicans to fall in line and continued pushing for support throughout the day. He and his lieutenants repeatedly warned rank-and-file Republicans that Boehner's plan was their only alternative to a Democratic option offered by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, or the financial calamity that could be precipitated by a government default.
The third collision, at 3:49 p.m. on westbound I-10 near Arizona 587, south of Chandler, two semis sandwiched a small car, seriously injuring the car's two passengers.
The other player that requires special game planning is Iona point guard Scott Machado. He is too big, strong, and quick for Nick Leon or Wesley Jenkins leaving only Steven Samuels as the only starter with a chance at containing him. In the last game against Iona, Dunne started Brandon Hall in an attempt to slow down the Gael point guard. It is a good strategy if Leon and Jenkins have their shooting touch. If they don’t, you can’t afford to have Hall’s lack of scoring on the floor.
The SEC said that Bhalla gave Khan inside information on Polycom's fourth-quarter earnings in 2005, and that Khan traded on the information and gave it to others, including Feinblatt and Yokuty.

If readers didn't like something in his paper, he heard about it. If they didn't get their paper on time, they let him know. He could be confronted while in line at the grocery store, on the sidelines at a Little League game, or while out with his family. And there was no deflecting responsibility.

That story goes that when a group of miners gathered to name their community, popular choice was Ptarmigan, a plentiful, and reportedly tasty, fowl native to the area. But they couldn't agree on its spelling. After a lengthy, heated debate, one miner declared in desperation:
Brahms’ Symphony No. 1, led by Ozawa, showed off the strong rapport between music director and orchestra. There were times when the orchestra’s sound grew distractingly gruff and its domineering violins upset the balance. A few solos sounded overly square. Still, from the frustrated passion of its first movement through the pulsating frenzy of its finale, the work’s power came through. Ozawa and the orchestra received a lengthy series of standing ovations.
The note below comes from a retired teacher with a different perspective than most parents or cheerleaders:
Everyone who is on the ballot in the Sept. 7 Democratic and Republican primaries or has shown interest in running Nov. 2 as an independent or third-party candidate was invited.

It's not an easy formula.

Houston co-produced and was featured on the 1992 soundtrack to "The Bodyguard" — a film in which she starred. The recording took album of the year honors at the 36th Grammys, and the yearning "I Will Always Love You," Houston’s biggest hit and signature song, won her golden gramophones in the record of the year and best pop vocal, female categories. At that moment, Houston was at the pinnacle — pop’s most reliable source of star power and one of the most gifted vocalists to lift a microphone to her lips.

Allen is running things, too, in Portland. But he lacks the ability to make swift decisions himself. He prides himself on being a basketball guy, to the point where he’s put himself in charge of personnel decisions as the de facto GM.

It’s why he needed gunslinger Whitsitt building the Blazers/Seahawks, and gutsy Mike Holmgren, also with the Seahawks, to reach the respective championship games.

Ripken: I don't think so. The funny question you ask is "If you could go back to 21, would you?" and I immediately say, "No." There's a lot of things you go through learning about yourself. In an ideal way of your baseball career, you'd like to have something like Derek Jeter would have, where a bad year is losing in the first round of the playoffs, if you really think about it, or Chipper Jones' run with 14 straight and they're in the playoffs all the time. You want to have success and be playing in the postseason every single year. Looking back at my career, I had a chance to do that early, and we had a couple chances to come back to that excitement of playoff baseball. But all your struggles and all the problems or even the 0-21 [start to the 1988 season], they are all learning experiences for your life, and I think you learn more when you go through the tough times and you get to the other side than you do when you just constantly have good things happen to you, so I wouldn't change a thing.

Each week, I found myself becoming more amazed at how much energy and pride the students used to create their nonfiction masterpiece. As I read their words and pored through their drawings, I realized Ms. Miklasz wasn't the only one who was sad for her teaching career to end. Her students clearly loved being in her class and didn't want their teacher to move away as she plans in May. As I read what many kids wrote about her, phrases such as "best teacher ever" reminded me how fortunate they are to have a caring, enthusiastic role model like Ms. Miklasz.

Bin Laden's network, in turn, was based on the superstructure of recruitment he and his "holy war" partners used in the 1980s to raise vast sums and also lure young Arabs to Afghanistan to fight.

Obama's address, during an unannounced visit to sign a strategic partnership agreement with President Hamid Karzai that sets the terms for relations after the departure of U.S. troops in 2014, was a chance for him to make an election-year case that he is winding down a costly and increasingly unpopular war.

• With all of the Knicks bad luck, Anthony has to be reminded of last year's first-round sweep at the hands of the Celtics, wrote Al Iannazzone of Newsday: "Anthony said he 'tries not to think about' last year's series. But he's thought long and hard about how James and Miami guarded him Saturday. The Heat fronted Anthony, mostly with James. When the Knicks threw it over the top, Miami sent a big man to double Anthony...

2. Buddy Dyer. Considering that nine months ago, the Orlando mayor was turning himself in at the Orange County Jail, it's somewhat remarkable to see him on this list at all. The scuttled effort to charge him with obscure and previously ignored campaign crimes obviously rattled Dyer, 47. But after treading lightly for his first few months back in office, he re-emerged with force. He is largely credited with changing the skyline of downtown Orlando and invigorating the area with an increasingly wealthy class of people living there. His ambitious goals now include renovating the TD Waterhouse Centre and Citrus Bowl, and building a performing-arts center. It's a lot to bite off. But our panelists respect him for trying and have kept him in second place.

Because, if they sign Manning, they now have to decide what to do with Tebow. If Tebow stays with the team, he's suddenly the No. 2 quarterback being asked to run an offense that fits Manning, not him. Any offense Manning runs will be one he has helped coordinate — part of signing Manning for any team is basically handing the keys and the play-calling for the most part to him.
“The champagne was flowing, people stayed there three hours afterward — it was almost like New Year’s Eve,” says Bailey, 35, of Riverdale, now a regular customer.
It was not lost on the 22-year-old that he had gone from playing with the Stampede to having a shot at the NBA three-point title in the span of four months.

Sex-obsessed though its women may be, "Heading South" sees them and their obliging lover in the larger context of sexual politics and colonial relationships. "Legba belongs to everyone," Ellen tells Brenda. "He makes the decisions." That's not true, though. As a citizen of impoverished Haiti, Legba is at the mercy of a brutal regime.

* Leave it to Craig Carton to actually boast about getting a gig on Spike TV. Spike’s prime time is designed almost entirely to draw desensitized young males, misfits, dopes and cleavage-droolers — those who value doo-doo jokes, skateboard wipeouts and guys being kicked in the head and groin. High-brow stuff. Carton’s a perfect fit.

Fourth lines in hockey often are like offensive linemen in the NFL: The only time they get recognized is when they screw up. But the trio of Brule, Chipchura and Langkow are changing that definition.

I'm still expanding that idea. It's early. I believe in the Internet. I believe that's the future. This is an Internet show that happens to be on television."
At one point he bit on a pump fake and drew a whistle in the second half. Coach Tom Izzo pulled him from the game. When Kearney approached his seat he swung his fist in the air in frustration, took a seat and pulled his jersey over his head.
The Saturday Alemany market in San Francisco is such a market, except for the six precious stools at the stand for All Star Tamales. The stand is anchored by a utilitarian van with a tarp, which covers a plastic table and the six always-full stools; waves of people just stand and wait.
David Blumenthal still uses a five-year-old green Samsung flip phone, even after his Welsh terrier chewed the case to "the consistency of an old piece of gum," he says. He tried to buy a replacement cover but couldn't find one. So he put Scotch tape over the back to hold in the battery. "It's a very basic, functioning telephone, and that's what I use it as—a telephone," says the Chestnut Hill, Mass., attorney. Raised in a frugal Maine family, Mr. Blumenthal sees no need to "keep running out and buying new things if you can patch them and they hold together."
"We put the ball in play. Our goal was not to strike out and make them work on defense. To score three in the first inning, then come up with eight in the second inning -- big, big help for our pitcher."

Jones: I don’t know what I’m going to do with my career, I just want to retire one day and have a burger place.
Ryan saying that Hill will come in and start is hardly a surprise. The Jets were in need of a field-stretching wide receiver who could take pressure off Santonio Holmes, and that's exactly what Hill can do. He played in a triple-option offense at Georgia Tech, but made the most of his catches by setting an NCAA record by averaging 55.2 yards on his nine touchdown grabs.
"I asked her, 'Why did you leave us?'" the grandmother, Maharajni Andhrabai, recalled. "She said, 'I was forced to.' She was weeping."

"I have some sympathy that this new policy may place some of these families in a bind. But we bought our house in Los Alamitos so our children could attend school here," said Nancy Lee, whose son will enroll in kindergarten this fall. "All families make sacrifices, but the difference is that Los Alamitos is our school district, and the schools belong to us."
• Ben Golliver, Blazersedge.com: From Portland's perspective -- should this report prove to be accurate -- this isn't a major win or a major loss. There's certainly the risk of injury to be weighed, as Batum did miss a significant portion of the 2009-2010 season following shoulder surgery before bouncing back to play in 80 games last year. When factoring in the potential benefits of him playing against quality competition and continuing to develop, though, this is basically a wash.

If you didn't want to dance you could pick up superhero props and pose for a group picture. Secure a gift bag of swag stocked with Heineken earbuds and Paul Mitchell "product." Or, at green-lit (both the color and sentiment) bars, get your fill of Patrón, another party sponsor. Judging by the swaying, smooth moves of the crowd, it's safe to say most went for the third option, several times.

When Vogel, 37, succeeded the fired Jim O'Brien on Jan. 30, many of us figured this would be one of those situations where a team would tank the rest of the season before trying to hire a big-name coach.

The changes to NCTD's business model have saved $4.9 million on BREEZE costs alone. The savings would have been $6.6 million if NCTD had not incurred one-time costs of $1.7 million related to increased costs for worker's compensation, unemployment insurance, and severance payments associated with the transition to contracted services. NCTD's operating budget for fiscal year (FY) 2011 decreased by almost $2 million when compared to the prior year. This is good news for our riders, as this decrease has allowed the District to lower fares, increase service, and reinvest in our system.
Labor leaders, however, said using profit-driven companies can harm the public.

Los Angeles gets more of its power from coal than from any other source, with the Utah plant providing more than a quarter of the city's electricity and an Arizona generating station providing an additional 12%. Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has pledged to wean L.A. off coal entirely by 2020. But that's proving to be a monumental commitment — and one difficult to keep.

OK, that's not fair. A majority of Republican voters clearly were not comfortable with Romney during the debates and the first half of the primary season. They flirted with a series of alternatives, including Gingrich, who won an important early primary in South Carolina. The proliferation of anti-Mitts arguably prevented the kind of head-to-head race that could have boosted a conservative alternative to the former Massachusetts governor.

When the two-hour show comes to an end, the audience members jump to their feet, clapping and stomping with fervor. At a post-show party next door, where guests ate cupcakes decorated with sequined gloves and fedoras, people gathered at the Cirque VIP table have big smiles.

The divorce rate, which peaked around 1980, is at its lowest level since the 1970s, according to the Census Bureau. In 2009, 9.2 out of every 1,000 men age 15-plus, and 9.7 out of every 1,000 women, divorced in the past 12 months. People often cite the statistic that 50% of marriages end in divorce. This number may no longer hold. The Census Bureau last looked at this number in 1996, and estimated some 50% of first marriages end in divorce, noting that number was based on numerical modeling, not survey data. It didn't address the question of second marriages. Many experts now believe the rate is in the 40% range.

Consider the saltimbocca ($17), a word that translates well here to "jump in the mouth." Most restaurants construct this dish by lining flattened meat with a slice of prosciutto and tucking in sage leaves. It often falls apart in the eating, leaving us to chase everything across the plate with a fork. But Bruell reconstructs it, rolling up the prosciutto and tucking it into a flavorful, boned chicken leg. The sage element is mysteriously there, and the meat, on a cream-fed bed of polenta, arrives so tender it practically falls open like a blossom.

In recent years, however, it seems many of those we've elected to office have decided that citizen involvement is nothing more than a hurdle to be overcome.

The bottom line: First things first. If you're hoping to avoid statins, red yeast rice may not be the product for you. The industrious fungi growing on rice are actually little pharmaceutical factories creating a natural supply of monacolin K, also known as lovastatin. As the suffix suggests, lovastatin is a bona fide statin drug. The first to hit the market, it's sold under the name Mevacor and is now available as a generic.

Early in the season, WPS administered a fine and docked the team a point in the standings — actions taken because of Borislow’s reluctance to install signboards around the field with ads for league sponsors, failure to create a team Web site and for scheduling home matches at a Florida Atlantic University complex that didn’t meet seating requirements.

Keller's lusty sensibility shows up in many dishes, whether it's the black steel skillet of black rice topped by local calamari, stewed garlic and a confetti of red peppers ($9) or the bright tangle of slender heirloom peppers in orange, red and green that engulf plump curls of prawns ($9). Accented with fresh oregano and garlic, it's a fresh seasonal dish that packs a salty, sweet, herbal punch. Bright, pink wild salmon is also boldly realized ($14), sitting on a bed of Saskatchewan chanterelles.
Argentina's northern province of Misiones, named for the settlements established during Spanish colonial times by the Catholic Church's Jesuit order, juts like a finger far into Brazil and Paraguay. A million tourists a year visit the province, but few seem aware of it—most come for a quick marvel at Iguazú Falls, the two-mile-wide cataract that divides Argentina from Brazil, moving on after an overnight stay. But more nature lovers are now exploring the toucan- and butterfly-filled Green Corridor that has long been overshadowed by the falls. The remarkable 4,250-square-mile string of wildlife reserves stretches from Salto Encantado Provincial Park in Misiones's central highlands to Iguazú National Park on the border with Brazil. Over the past five years, a number of midmarket lodges have opened to accommodate travelers.

Osteoporosis causes progressive bone loss, leaving the bones porous, fragile and likely to break. It is responsible for more than 1.5 million fractures each year, including more than 700,000 vertebral fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures. An estimated one in two women and one in five men over age 65 will sustain bone fractures due to osteoporosis.
In response to opponents who say this ordinance will "criminalize homelessness," the fact is that not one Sit & Lie citation has been filed with the Denver County Court since its adoption. This success is due in part to law enforcement and social service providers working together to get these individuals access to the care they need. We firmly believe similar results will be seen through the passage of the unauthorized-camping ordinance.

Questionable Calls: Taking the brittle Broyles over a cornerback capable of manning one of the outside spots is a decision that could come back to bite Mayhew, as Bentley may be too small to develop beyond a dependable nickel back. Not adding a running back showed great faith in the health of concussion-prone Jahvid Best and 2011 second-round pick Mikel Leshoure, but that position still remains tenuous.

Over the past seven or eight years, I've scaled back the exercising and focused more on what I eat when I'm not eating out. My strategy: I eat the same thing for breakfast and lunch every single day: fruit and egg-white omelet (300 calories) for breakfast; a giant salad with lettuce, tomato, mushroom, red pepper, red onion, celery, white-meat chicken and no-cal salad dressing (300 calories) for lunch.
A little more than 20 years later, officials began to wonder if maximum security was enough. By 1995, inmate assaults on staff topped 1,000 system-wide.

The recently completed BRAC round has transformed APG into a place that, like Ft. Meade, has a lot of civilians and relatively few people in uniform, which is to say, a lot of commuters. This transformation was anticipated, and there was a lot of talk about improving the road and rail systems supporting Aberdeen Proving Ground. There also has been some action, as improvements are being made to access from Route 40 to Aberdeen Proving Ground. Still, the ride from I-95 to post that takes less than 15 minutes at night when there's no traffic is anticipated, without substantial improvements to the roadways linking the post to the interstate, to take three times that long in a few years

No. I was not involved in the solicitation, evaluation or selection of the winners of this procurement. This question requires context about the decision made by the Department of Aviation (“DOA”) and the Department of Procurement (“DOP”) to bid the entire concessions package at once. This is something that has never been done. Typically, the packages are bid in phases. The DOA and DOP decided to rebid everything at once to ensure the most fair and ethical process possible. Why? If city officials had phased in the program, some would have argued that companies that received lease extensions were getting special treatment because they donated to my campaign. So, instead, my Administration started the procurement process from a blank slate where everyone could compete on a level playing field.

If you go with the small plates, they can add up fast if you hope to make a meal out of them. And the entrees didn't impress enough to warrant the relatively steep prices. The wines, however, are reasonably priced and the list has a wide range. It's also impressive that you can order a taste, a flight, a glass or a bottle. That puts you in control of what you spend and how you imbibe.

Rep. Jerry Sonnenberg's measure would have yanked severance tax payments from local governments that took steps to slow or prevent oil and gas drilling.

The debt crisis has been a humiliating blow to the proud Punjabi culture and economic history. Punjab's agriculture sector in the late 1960s and 1970s was largely responsible for India achieving food security. Using new hybrid seeds imported from Mexico and taking advantage of extensive canal networks, farmers saw spectacular yields of wheat and rice. From 1966 to 1969, Punjab grew at an average of 8.4%, twice the national rate.

He closed it out by salvaging par on No. 18 with a chip from in front of the green that stopped, checked up, spun backward to about 2 feet for a stress-free putt. He doffed his cap, raised both fists and smiled that wide smile, knowing hell be sleeping in late Saturday  and sleeping on the lead.

It would be easy to slam the conference as paper thin and leave it at that. To lump the Ducks and Beavers with the rest. But I don't think it's Oregon and Oregon State holding the conference down anymore. Rather, the potential top-tier programs such as UCLA, USC, Arizona, Stanford and Cal are stale and un-evolved.

The Blues have the potential to be a playoff team, but a lot will depend on the play of Jaro Halak and staying healthy. If the goaltending is in the top 10 in the league and the man games lost stays under 150, they should be OK.

The Senate tax plan also deserves credit for asking more from higher earners. Marylanders earning $200,000 and filing jointly would pay no more than 5 percent (not counting the local piggyback) while those earning more than $500,000 would pay as much as 5.75 percent. The proposal also offers a slight increase in the earned income tax credit for low-wage workers.

Something remarkable happened over the past week to soccer in America. For the second time in 12 years, the World Cup women put a grip on the proprietary rights to the title of "The Future of Soccer in America." What the dearly departed NASL, MISL and current Major League Soccer have been unable to do with men as the headliners, the American women have done once again on a global stage. While fleeting as it may be, the U.S World Cup ladies have captured the imagination of an American nation that has steadfastly resisted falling in love with soccer as a spectator sport.

He returned May 27, but never hit the same way and was back on the DL in July.

I think he's hitting his stride at about the right time." ... Outfielder/infielder Allen Craig took a day off from hitting and running and spent time in the gym strengthening his legs; he had surgery on his right knee in November. Hopeful of playing minor-league games before camp ends, Craig said his knee had felt sore after he got 10 at-bats in an afternoon a few days ago at Port St. Lucie, Fla., but the pain had dissipated. "I feel good," Craig said. "I had a rough couple of days after that day in St. Lucie and was a little sore. It wasn't a step back or anything, but it was kind of a reality check, because I was rehabbing for a month straight without any days off and hitting it pretty hard. I took a day off to recover and this was my first day back in the gym. Nothing really has changed since I got down here. You have a couple of days that are bad and then you come back and you're better than you were before." ...
