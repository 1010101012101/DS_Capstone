The obvious problem this fixes is long-term retiree health care for school employees.

The glory days, when Eastman Kodak Co. ruled the world of film photography, lasted for over a century.

It was in 1837 that the Morris and Essex Railroad first came to Madison. The arrival of the railroad impacted the village of Madison in a number of ways. The availability of reliable transportation between the town and the east caused Madison to quickly grow from a small rural community into a “commuter suburb” – the country home to those who worked in cities like Orange, Newark, and New York. As F. J. Esposito observed in his book, The Madison Heritage Trail, when the station at the corner of Waverly Place and Kings Road was first opened in 1855, at least 50 residents were already regular commuters.

"Pooh" is a nickname Rose has had since he was a child because, like Winnie the Pooh, he has a sweet tooth. "GWS" means game-winning shots.

In a recent interview with altsounds.com, the outspoken Emily Haines suggested that people are currently looking to be entertained by clowns — trash-celebrities that viewers can look down on. Perhaps. How, though, does she explain the success of her own band? Nobody but a virtuoso could feel superior to the musicians in Metric. The Toronto-based quartet plays maddeningly catchy ’80s-inspired new wave with the two-fisted power of a progrock band. In Haines, it’s got a frontwoman whose undeniable sex appeal is largely (but not completely) based on her formidable intelligence and her clever and occasionally confrontational wordplay. The band will open the show for the similarly ambitious Muse at Prudential Center, 165 Mulberry St., Newark, 8 p.m., $42.50 to $65; visit prucenter.com or call (201) 507-8900. — T.M.

One final word: Two is a pattern, and major technical glitches do mar the flow of a show. The sound cut out during the middle of Bon Jovi’s “Runaway” during its inaugural performance at New Meadowlands, and the band played without power for more than 60 seconds. Last night, the same thing happened to Ludacris: He freestyled for a minute without realizing the audio had failed him. If the speakers at New Meadowlands go dead during “Hotel California” at the Eagles show this Thursday, remember: You’ve been warned.

"La Luna" is delightful, even as it forgos the crazy sight-gags that typically define Pixar work, but the real standout in this strong lineup of nominees is "The Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore." The work of children's book artist/author William Joyce and animator Brandon Oldenburg, this 15-minute gem borrows from The Wizard of Oz, from Buster Keaton (its title character is Keatonesque, to say the least), and from old nursery rhymes (Humpty Dumpty is featured prominently). But along with its gentle surrealist tone, there's a note of melancholy, and of danger. Made in Louisiana, "Morris Lessmore" summons up memories of the Katrina disaster, too.

A major difference from the Iraq war run-up is that so many military leaders have spoken out against war. Most former or present Israeli military and intelligence leaders oppose an attack, one or more pointing out that: Iran is not an "existential threat" to Israel; an attack would push Iran to actually develop a nuclear weapon; the attack would only delay such development by one to three years; and the repercussions could be disastrous.

The trick is to outsource the pastry. While technically not the same as true croissant dough, sheets of frozen puff pastry can stand in just fine.

On June 18, La Russa bolted from the dugout to yank Franklin from the 9th inning in a close game against Oakland. Franklin had nothing, wasn't feeling well, and the first three A's to face him reached base. La Russa didn't waste time; he brought in Jason Motte who closed out a 4-3 win. I thought that was a good sign: the hope was that La Russa would be more flexible in his thinking rather than stay addicted to using one closer, and one closer only.

As we talked about 1983, I could see it in Abatemarco's eyes. He was picturing the final seconds. With the score tied 52-52, and fortunate that Houston freshman Alvin Franklin had missed the front end of a one-and-one, N.C. State held the ball for a final shot at winning the thing in regulation.

Surfboards can get big, to be sure. Longboards, which may run 9 feet or more, won't fly with many carriers. But popular shortboards, commonly around 6 feet long, fall within the usual size limits for checked sports equipment. Although wider, they're about the same length as alpine skis, which many airlines fly for free. Go figure.

In a recent letter, Ed Golterman says the role of government is to "meet the basic needs of the people" and that cutting snow removal by MODOT & STL County does not accomplish this. If we are going to keep our same level of snow removal, we are going to have to find a way to come up with the money. That means higher tax rates. Where should we raise them? County real estate and personal property taxes for starters. We know that tax revenue is down on all levels of government. Is he willing to pay the increase in taxes? Or, maybe he is like many of our politicians. They don't think they need to have the money....just go ahead & spend it whether we have it or not. Sound familiar. Maybe Mr. Golterman should go into politics.

"For the Bible Tells Me So is a bold and moving documentary. It brought me to tears in several parts. I think anyone who is a religious person should try to open their minds and hearts and really listen to what this movie has to say. Watch the whole thing and give it a chance before you strike it down. Being a Christian myself it has always bothered me that there is a lot of hate towards gays coming from several religions and the people who practice them. In my opinion I always thought following God and being a Christian was about love and acceptance. Taking people in instead of pushing them away . . . isn't that what God is all about?

A talent like Hall, who ran the ball 37 times for 161 yards last season and caught eight passes for 83 yards, has proven he belongs on the field. It might make sense to use him more as a pass-catcher, a position of need, than as a running back, where the deck is stacked.

The foundation has become so successful that the district balances its budget expecting $1 million in donations. The money beyond that $1 million -- in this year's case, about $400,000 -- goes to saving teaching positions that might otherwise be cut.

Peering into the mirror of understanding — You are my reflection. Our bond is absolution.

(*Though I always find it interesting that players will criticize ex-teammates en masse, retroactively. In the same interview Jones said that the "one thing we're trying to get away from is the egos." He'd probably never expand on these comments. But wouldn't you love to know who, on the Orioles teams of the last few years, could actually sustain a big ego?)
It is a grand monument that in some ways overwhelms Public Square. It towers over the monuments to city founder Moses Cleaveland and long-ago Mayor Tom Johnson.

As the states and taxpayers debate over free tuition for illegal teenage school kids, we must realize that if allowed to remain in the United States, they will serve this country better if educated, working and contributing taxes.

"They (instructors) might give a pose that's more of basic and add options with various levels to that," Krump said.
It is terrific news for the Giants, and potentially terrific news for the NFL, which can now continue hyperventilating over the prospect of a Manning Bowl in the first New York-New Jersey Super Bowl in 2014, because predicting a Super Bowl XLVII berth for the Broncos in Archie’s and Olivia’s New Awlins requires a leap of faith, even if Peyton’s surgical neck and spine are built to last. It is terrific news for the Giants because the NFC runners-up 49ers are diminished now and nowhere near the threat they would have been with Peyton Manning.
Gingrich will maintain his plans this week, campaigning in North Carolina through Friday thenattending the glitzy White House Correspondents’ Dinner in Washington on Saturday. The formal announcement is delayed until Tuesday so the campaign can arrange to bring in Gingrich's family and friends.

Ah, Ahi Tuna ($27). Barely seared and served on smashed edamame, the combination was sumptuous but light, with ginger-spiked shiitake mushrooms for flavor and fried wonton strips for crunch.
And yet, governing is a heck of a lot harder than getting elected. You need serious organizational skills, the ability to convince people you're right, experience in forming coalitions. In that sense, the quest for cash and volunteers is an important test. Nobodies accomplish nothing. Even the idealists at City Hall recogonize this: To qualify for taxpayer financing, candidates must show a modicum of public support and organizational skill by collecting $5 contributions and signatures from 1,000 people.

Even though Griffin is working on the sidelines, Lowe has an eye on him and comes over to help. With the flick of a wrist, Lowe easily flips the hat up onto his head.

During his career, Voinovich served in the Ohio House -- he won his maiden race in a 2-1 Democratic district by shamelessly attacking his opponents for having sponsored the state's open housing law -- as Cuyahoga County auditor and commissioner and as lieutenant governor. As mayor in the aftermath of default, he got Cleveland's finances in order and forged a strong partnership with the private sector; those efforts attracted national attention and helped set the table for the city's comeback in the 1990s. As governor, he invested heavily in Head Start, but was not nearly so generous with higher education -- a decision that earned the scorn of Ohio State University President Gordon Gee.
Last month, a top Romney aide said the general election was a time for campaigns to "hit the reset button ... like an Etch A Sketch." While Democrats and Romney's GOP challengers ridiculed the comment, Santorum's departure gives Romney a chance to reboot.

Despite his culinary expertise — or perhaps because of it — he respects the complexities of the humble empanada. Tio’s empanadas were popular at Daryl’s Wine Bar, an urbane restaurant in New Brunswick where David was once a partner. (Londoño led empanada seminars for the line cooks there.) And Tio’s empanadas, stuffed with beef and potatoes or with minced vegetables, are flying out of the kitchen at Alice’s; the restaurant sells hundreds each week.
"I could give Brother Larry my vision and he would organize the men and women to bring about the fruition of what I desired," Farrakhan wrote in the letter.
The Blazers have until June 30 to make a one-year $8.8 million qualifying offer. That feels like a no-brainer. But it's what happens after that move that feels dicey. Because if Oden is miserable in Portland, and wants a change of scenery or a fresh start somewhere else, the No. 1 overall pick in 2007 could potentially agree to the one-year offer, do nothing else and become an unrestricted free agent by summer 2012.

Nakalele Point on Maui: One of the most mysteriously beautiful areas in the islands. At mile marker 38 is a turnout on the winding, rugged Highway 340. Visitors stroll a green, rolling field above sea cliffs. Visitors have stacked scores of stone piles – cairns – and made stone circles. Eerily beautiful, especially on sunny weekdays when you can sometimes be alone at the spot. A trail leads to a blowhole that shoots sprays of water into the air on days when the surf is large.
One Facebook thread said, "Wow! Everyone should go to the Westminster Kennel Clubs Facebook page and read the sore loser crap that people are spewing on there about Malachy winning the Westminster.

A: I never got my hopes up to even thinking I could have that. From Day 1, our doctor was like, "You're not going to be able to do that and play basketball." So after a couple other opinions said no, I already knew it was kind of a no ... but, like I said, I didn't even really get my hopes up. I don't even remember how I felt when the second doctor said no. Dr. (Don) Roberts said, "Nah, that's not going to work."
“She’s been dedicated from the very beginning and her dedication shines through.”

No, we did not arrive at this conclusion upon viewing their stumbling antics last night — it was 24 hours earlier, during the season opener in Washington, where the Nets actually won because a dozen things happened in a precise, surreal sequence. Among them: John Wall was appalling; the Wizards missed 13 foul shots; Kris Humphries was by far the best big on the floor; Deron Williams was clutch when he had to be; and the Nets’ defense yielded an average of 19 points per period over the last three quarters.

It has been 13 straight games that opposing starters have pitched at least five innings against the Tigers, not exactly a ringing endorsement for a high-octane offense created to put relentless pressure on starting pitching, forcing managers to use their bullpens much earlier than they'd prefer.

One of Curaçao's prized dive sites is the Mushroom Forest, off the southwestern side of the island in water up to 65 feet deep. The site is full of vertical coral that have been eroded by the water into mushroom shapes.

We didn't see many exotic fish or turtles on our dive, but it was one of the most intriguing dive sites we visited.

And there are captains such as James T. Kirk, exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new civilizations and boldly going where no man has gone before. He is a charismatic, demanding sort, who takes risks, clashes with his officers and pushes crew members to exasperated responses, "I'm giving her all she's got, Captain!"
Think of the fight over spending for the current fiscal year as Act 1 in a three-part budget drama. Act 2, coming this spring, will be the fight over whether to raise the ceiling on the federal government's debt, and what conditions to attach to it. Act 3, in the fall, will likely be the biggest battle of all, over the federal budget for 2012.

"I've been in two situations where I would've thought I would've been there the rest of the season, but it didn't pan out that way. Sometimes, it's a numbers game. It's not always about your talent level or your fit. It's a great thing to know that I belong somewhere for the rest of the year."
The bill would allow undocumented students with five years in the country and at least three in Oregon to pay resident tuition at the state's universities. They now must pay out-of-state tuition, which is about three times as high and out of reach for most undocumented students, who also do not qualify for student financial assistance.

The new Mosaic is, in one aspect, merely a replication, but it's geographically removed from its twin downtown and adds quite a spark to the area where it's been placed. Owner Schmitz should be congratulated for another very good restaurant - and for his persistence.
How high rates would go on credit card and home equity loans would depend on the speed with which the economy and loan demand recovers.

In the past, it was fun to find the perfect armor and weapons for all companions, but now only Hawke can wear boots, gloves and headgear. Companions can change out their weapons, rings, amulets and belts. They can only wear the armor they are found in, which can be upgraded somewhat.
But the morning of the high school writing test, in September 2009, school administrators pulled Chantel and several other Carver juniors aside. All stood a good chance of failing — and of lowering the school’s odds of meeting its do-or-die performance targets. While the rest of the 11th grade took the test required for all juniors, Chantel and the others worked puzzles in a special-education classroom.
“I send an e-mail every week (sometimes it’s two, sometimes it’s three e-mails) informing all the superintendents.
