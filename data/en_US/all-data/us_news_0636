Nothing is more up front and transparent than standing in front of the City Council and advocating for something that has been long debated, even advocated by your own paper, that we have to make an investment.

But after 10 years in Afghanistan and nearly eight in Iraq, why are we so blind to realities as to think we can simply walk away? Extremists are in the ascendance in both nations.

The course was closed about a year and a half ago to be reconfigured to make room for about 240 apartment and townhome units in Chevron Corp.'s La Floresta development. The course is owned by Chevron but will be turned over to the city as part of the development deal. During work on the course, contamination was found in some of the soil. O'Donnell told council members Chevron is still working with the Environmental Protection Agency to come up with a cleanup plan; it is taking longer than expected.

"I don't go to Saint-Tropez anymore—money-grubbers and vulgarians," says Evans, who spent more than a decade hitting the French Riviera and staying at the once discreetly chic Hôtel du Cap. Evans says that the problem with the new-money players is that they're money-smart but culturally anemic. The 10-digit successes have come so fast for them that there's been no time—and, for most of them, no inclination—to pursue character-broadening hobbies like lepidoptery or oenology, or interests in Flemish paintings, Gregorian literature, the opera, learning new languages.

If al-Awlaki committed treason by giving aid and comfort to America's enemies, he should have been arrested, charged and tried according to the U.S. Constitution.. The same information that Mr. Saleh, the dictator, helped provide for the drone attack could have been used to arrest al-Awlaki. Clearly, the aim from the start was to kill, not capture him.

Best modern ballpark: PNC Park, Pittsburgh. Small is beautiful. With seating for a bit fewer than 39,000 in two tiers plus outfield seating, the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates is a modern treasure. The industrial heritage of the city is seen in the steel truss work and limestone bricks. It sits beside the Allegheny River with views of the skyscrapers of the city's Golden Triangle across the way. The team is terrible year in and year out, which for the tourist is a good thing – ticket prices are among the lowest in baseball, and you can usually walk up and get a good seat.

A chorus of protests that Gov. Jerry Brown was "kicking children out of public school" greeted his proposal to strike a new, 14th year of school — transitional kindergarten — from the budget, saving California close to $700 million a year for more than a decade.

And the political forces that fought to add the new year of education are partly to blame for its demise.

We would have a Christmas quite different from our traditional Christmases, when the children were little.

Rivoli hasn't stood still. Partners Roscoe Skipper and Wendy Brucker have redone the interior; it's sleeker, with a vague Japanese sensibility and a more manicured garden visible through the large windows. The restaurant still has a 1950s ranch house feel, updated with 1960s Asian.

"That's the great thing, because when you're blessed and you've had a career and you're financially set and you have a lot of opportunities and a lot of things you can do, you don't just have to take whatever's out there. I want to set up what's the most fun for me, what works into my schedule the best, what can cater around my family the most- that becomes the No 1 priority. But I don't think there's any question that I'll be doing something with at least one of the networks."
Kear, who had never written with Underwood before this record, was thrilled with her as a collaborator. The day they wrote the quirky "Cupid's Got A Shotgun," Kear had suggested the title at the beginning of the session, and they had spent two to three hours working on another tune before getting stuck.
The night Marissa died, Milligan's big extended family and friends packed the house and offered solace. Her doctor sedated her. She slept for a few hours. When she woke, "I would just go into the front room and sit on the floor, curl up with my arms around my knees with her picture there." For months she took sedatives and antidepressants. "I didn't want to live," Milligan said. "I was hoping God would have a Mack truck run me over." If not for her other daughter, now 5-year-old Olivia -- who routinely asks people who in their family has died -- "I wouldn't be here."

I don't expect anything different from the Blues as they close out the season. The Presidents' Trophy means something and you want to be playing strong hockey heading into the playoffs.

The free agent floodgates should open wide for the Broncos now that Manning is their quarterback, putting them in the mix for quality veterans, possibly including Manning's former teammates Jeff Saturday and Dallas Clark.
"The prospect of pain generally, the pain of loss, of breakup, of death, is what makes it so tempting to avoid love and stay safely in the world of liking," Franzen acknowledges, but in the end, it is the counter-argument that lingers, even (or especially) when it leaves us exposed.

Nicole Ayres was one of the top prospects to come out of the Garden State in recent memory, receiving a full scholarship to Fordham and winning Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Year honors in 2007 before transferring back home after her sophomore year to be closer to her family. But no matter her life’s path, she would always be the girl who trudged out into her backyard amid the brutal Jersey winters and dig a path from a makeshift mound to the red brick garage and pitch — the thwack of the ball against the house prompting her chilly neighbors to come out and stare.
“It’s just the flamboyant, all-over-the-place kind of stuff,” Coughlin said. “He just has to learn that ball gets in a position away from your body and good things do not happen.”

In choosing rhetoric, the opportunity to weigh in with a valuable and considered opinion was lost.
Television was where we turned when hijacked airliners crashed into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers, the Pentagon and a field in southwest Pennsylvania. Television brought us together, a stunned nation united in grief. Its news divisions delivered the grim pictures and details. Then, over the next decade, the medium's entertainment divisions delivered dramas progressively grimmer in tone. (Mark Dawidziak)

Since Citrus closed in 2001, chefs and restaurants have come and gone from this spot. So when the Hatfields looked at moving from their modest little restaurant on Beverly Boulevard to this sprawling space, they took a big gamble. No one has been able to make the space really work. On the other hand, it's never really looked this good.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Obviously, the author of the article is unfamiliar with how the Social Security program operates or he is joining some of the current protagonists trying to frighten the American people into believing that the insurance system is about to collapse.

"The ball's in our court," Dayton said after the meetings, vowing to prepare his own stadium proposal by Nov. 7.
But Suarez was never caught on tape saying he would do any favors. Rather, he told Dwek his donation had no bearing on the project. It was also inconclusive whether the mayor ever knowingly took money from Dwek. He turned down $10,000 cash. He voided a $10,000 check. Ultimately Suarez kept just $2,500, which the mayor believed was a legitimate donation to his defense fund, his lawyers said.

The Children's Relief Nursery serves children up to ages 3 and 4 because those years, Arsenault says, "are the most critical years for a child's brain development."
Merit (sans) pay. So the jig is pretty much up on merit pay. Those pushing it always claimed their goal was to financially reward the best teachers — which sounds swell. Hey, if we can find a fair way to do so, I'm all for it. But the merit-pay plan these guys finally passed doesn't include the money needed to reward the best teachers. And merit pay without the "pay" part seems more like merit-less.

Unfortunately, the new law also does some bad things: It reduces the time for early voting, notably in-person voting, and it forbids mailing absentee ballot applications to all voters -- a popular practice that has helped Cuyahoga County reduce Election Day congestion.
The India interlude leads to one of the documentary's inspiring moments: McCartney, Harrison and Starr reminiscence about the experience while sitting together on a blanket at an unidentified English garden spot. Harrison has a ukulele and plucks out "Deradoon," a song he wrote during the India visits but has never performed or recorded. It's sadly one of the few times the three surviving Beatles are together on screen.
Earlier this decade, the U.S. State Department included an estimate of 800,000 people trafficked across international borders for any purpose each year in an annual report on the problem, but the last two reports, including one out this week, didn't include the figure.

Principal Luis Heckmuller said that upon arriving in 2008, he found a staff dedicated but not thoroughly covering the standard curriculum.

Outfielder Allen Craig, who is nearing a return from knee surgery in November, started at designated hitter for High-A Palm Beach on Monday night and singled in his first three at-bats.
We'll see what they do. Snead and Fishger have three picks in the second round, and then go again at No. 65 overall (early in the third round.) That gives them an opportunity to plug in several roster gaps. Again, they have so many glaring weaknesses, that I can't really growl about where they decide to go in the second round and third round as long as they come up with good players who can start early in their careers.
Mike Lally, owner of Tim Lally Chevrolet in Bedford, said dealerships that are set to survive, like his, could benefit from the bankruptcy filing.
But the very reason Collins would not let Wright play last night — so his .583 swing doesn’t change — is the very reason he should err on the side of caution here, and DL Wright if he must.

LeAnn Rimes wore a version of the boldly patterned Stella McCartney dress with swoopy cut-outs that's been getting a lot of traction on red carpets lately (Kidman wore a longer version of the same dress to another country music awards show last year). Taylor Swift ditched her girly gowns for a sleek white J. Mendel gown with gold trim and blocky cut-outs at the waist. And Miranda Lambert, who doesn't always dress to her curvy figure's best, looked pretty good in a gorgeous hammered gold halter gown by Randi Rahm.
There will be no end to the anarchism that destroys property and uses violence like the events on Mission Street until there are some consequences. Has anyone ever read about one of these scum actually spending time in jail and/or paying a fine and restitution? Meanwhile, police are damned if they take action and damned for not taking action (as in the Mission on Monday). I couldn't be a cop, because if someone threw a rock or a metal bar at me, I doubt I would have the ability not to respond in kind.
SANDY, Utah (AP) — Alvaro Saborio scored twice and Real Salt Lake ran its unbeaten streak against New England to five games.
The most interesting thing about this was that I got to learn about a lot of great little local spots I've never been to before — full of character and characters.

This larvae-lunch therapy helps heal bedsores, surgical wounds and diabetic ulcers, which is what yours sounds like. Diabetes can foster festering wounds because poor circulation hinders healing, and nerve damage can let sores appear without any pain. If the wound won't heal, it can lead to amputation of a toe, foot or leg. But maggot therapy, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2004, could put you back on the dance floor.

Not that His Williness seemed to mind the attention: At one public event, the mayor showed up in kingly red robe and gold crown, just as he appeared in the strip. "Willie was a gift from the cartoon gods," says Frank, 62, who bears a striking resemblance to his Farley character, though his own black hair and mustache are now peppered with gray. "He would shoot from the lip. He had a patronage army of 'special assistants.' He ...'' Frank stops mid-sentence and sighs, looking nostalgic.
In Sunday's pneumatic-tire category, it came down to a duel between Kyle Minor, driving a three-wheel adapted go-kart, and the man who built that car, several modifications earlier, who was now driving Wacky Willy's, a 300-pound enclosed vehicle with a smoked Plexiglass windshield, a low, angled, aerodynamic design and very professional-looking steering, brake and speedometer equipment neatly installed inside.

There was much grinning and giggling by the band and shuffling about by the roadies. Lanois joked that the crew must have "taken a little LSD" and suggested everyone "wind the clock back and pretend that never happened," which they did.

As the leader of an exciting, innovative four-piece group, it was nothing for him to worry about, a wrong note that was followed by an evening of just-right ones.

Scuba divers will recognize the neoprene fabric of these wine and beer carriers as the same stuff that keeps one warm underwater in a wet suit, at the cost of making even the smallest tummy jut out like a overfed bear's. But a bulge in these flexible, durable bags by Built NY is attractive, as it means you're keeping a bottle of wine or two at the right temperature as you carry them to a party or restaurant. For beer lovers, there's even a neoprene tote designed to carry six cold ones. But even if the bright color matches your wet suit, don't dive with it -- dive certification organizations frown on imbibing underwater.

Goldsworthy's stone benches seem to be randomly scattered within the space but they, too, have a narrative intent. He painstakingly formed a snaking fissure in the pavers at the front entrance.

The crack then cascades down the other side of the seat and splits into tributaries of finer cracks throughout the entry courtyard.

Americans were not always so myopic that they saw the world through the cross hairs of their rifle sights. During the depression of 1892 to 1896, unemployed workers marched to Washington by the thousands in what was then the largest mass protest this country had seen. In 1932, even more jobless people -- 25,000 -- staged what was, at that time, the largest march on Washington, demanding public works jobs and a hike in the inheritance tax. From the '60s to the '80s, Americans marched again and again -- peacefully, nonviolently and by the hundreds of thousands -- for civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, economic justice and against wars. In fact, this has been a major focus of Piven's scholarly work over the years -- the American tradition of protest and resistance to economic injustice -- and it's a big enough subject to keep hundreds of academics busy for life.

Jefferies analyst Peter Misek, who is in Orlando for the conference, said he was disappointed that Heins said he would wait to see what kind of traction BlackBerry 10 got before pursuing possible licensing deals for things like RIM's popular BlackBerry messenger service.

Ahmad Bradshaw and Brandon Jacobs are No. 1 and No. 1A in the Giants backfield. The backup runners have not yet been determined. D.J. Ware was the No. 3 running back last season, and the team is high on the five-year veteran, who rushed for 37 yards on eight carries in Monday’s loss to the Jets. Andre Brown is a former fourth-round pick who the team re-signed during training camp, and the coaching staff has been impressed by his speed. That’s still not apparent in games, though, where Brown has not made the most of his carries. Da’Rel Scott, the Giants’ seventh-round pick, flashed with a 97-yard touchdown in the second preseason game. He’s a speedy back who has practice-squad eligibility, although the team must determine whether they can afford to let him hit the open market. Then there’s Charles Scott, who’s 242 pounds and provides a bruising presence lacking from some of the other rushers.

Where to stay: A word on finding hotels: The apps I bought were not strong on credible recommendations for either eating or hotels. Plenty of hotels were listed, but it was impossible to figure out which ones were better than others. I suggest using Trip Advisor (tripadvisor.com) before you go, and look for a place with some character. The Savoy Hotel Berlin used to be frequented by Greta Garbo, which ought to be good enough for anyone. Opened in 1929, it has the modern touches of flat-screen TVs in the rooms and a pleasantly renovated lobby and restaurant. It's centrally located in West Berlin, a short walk from the underground. If cigars are your thing, you'll want to linger at the Casa de Habano in the Times Bar.

Ball wanted a push-off call on Nicks on the final play of the first quarter. I’d say he has a point. That could’ve forced a first-and-20 to change things had it been called. It wasn’t, and the Giants scored their second touchdown four plays into the second quarter.

This was one of those games that ought to make a lot of folks nervous, because if this wasn't simply the rare disastrously bad start that comes around once every five years and 113 starts in Wainwright's career, but actually an unnerving foreshadowing of more uncomfortable bumps in the road, maybe we all should be throwing up our hands in alarm. This was a day when his fastball wasn't fast, his curveball didn't curve, when everything he threw to the plate lacked even the slightest bit of the late-breaking filthiness that has been a part of Wainwright's pitching signature since he broke into the bigs seven seasons ago.

Neil Diamond got his start in the 1960s writing songs that were hits for others including the Monkees ("I'm a Believer," "A Little Bit Me, A Little Bit You"). But after collecting his first hit, "Solitary Man," in 1966, the glass-beaded, arena-packing headliner from New York City has become one of the best selling recording artists of all time.

The overriding concern is that a merged airline will not use Hopkins as a hub -- a transfer point for travelers arriving in Cleveland and continuing on to other cities.

And that explains the persistence of what John wrote: His "multivalent" language is an apocalyptic inkblot that allows for whatever polemic meanings the times and rulers require.

Mike Acker: The one thing Blazer fans everywhere should be ecstatic about is that at some point we get to see Gerald Wallace in a Blazers jersey for 82 games. It may not be next year, if the lockout kills part or all of 2011-12, but at some point we'll get a full regular season of "Crash." The question for Rich Cho and his cohorts shouldn't be is Gerald Wallace going to be a Blazer next season. The question should be, how long will "Crash" stay in Portland. The Blazers most likely can't afford to give Wallace max type money, what with so much of the payroll already dedicated to Brandon Roy and LaMarcus Aldridge going forward, but he needs to be considered an important part of this team's future. Getting him here was big; keeping him here will be huge.

While Mr. Clark embodied a "safe" aura on camera, off camera he was the prototype for the fledgling music scene's new-model impresario.

Mind blown, hair on fire. Seeing "The Cabin in the Woods" set a new personal benchmark for fiendishly creative takes on genre entertainment.

As such, it's almost impossible to describe in detail without spoiling surprises you should discover for yourself.
