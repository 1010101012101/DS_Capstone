Ward also said there should be "an articulable factual basis" for domestic intelligence collection, such as a "specific reason why we’re looking at this location, this person."

“At this point we don’t think that there is any imminent threat to anybody at the high school or anybody at any of the other schools,” Ferguson said on Monday.

"When I first got here, he was always yelling at me," Grant said. "I was like, 'I'm not used to this, why are you yelling at me 24-7?' But they said when they stop yelling at you, that's when they don't care about you. So now I take it as 'OK, coach cares about me, so I'm going to keep working hard.'"
"He doesn't accept being good. He wants to be excellent."
SAN DIEGO: Police Friday arrested a couple wanted for questioning in connection with a killing in West Virginia.
But even as the county looks for ways to rescue the Parks Department, it is adding to the agency's load. The county expects to turn Highway 1 at Devils Slide into a recreation area as early as 2013, at a cost of $2 million. It has also proposed taking over management of Pacifica's Sharp Park Golf Course from the city of San Francisco. The county may be legally bound to oversee Devils Slide, however, and it would seek private contributions to fund the overhaul of Sharp Park into a course that's friendlier to wildlife.

“I was student council president when Dr. James was president,” said Cardona, a graduate of Glassboro State College. “I was also his employee in my role managing public relations. And, when he retired and went back to the classroom, I was attending his lectures. It was wonderful to have these experiences with such a great man in these three phases of my life.”
Now the area has an Applebee’s and a Home Depot. O’Neal said he’s investing because he wants the rebuilding of his birth city to be part of his legacy, and because his mother told him to get involved. But he is a pretty savvy businessman, too, who can see an opportunity.

Indiana already has spent about $18.3 million in federal SIG dollars on 12 schools over the past two years. The U.S. Department of Education has allocated an additional $9 million for Indiana for a third group of schools this summer, which will raise annual SIG spending here to more than $27 million annually.
Shaw attended Indiana University of Pennsylvania. He grew up in Philadelphia. As a teenager he once closed his eyes and flared a single to right field in a summer league game against Len Barker, who pitched a perfect game for the Indians in May of 1981. Not surprisingly, Barker does not remember it and no pro scouts were at all impressed by it.
Wrong, said U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Urbana, Ohio. Jordan is chairman of the Republican Study Committee, a group of fiscal conservatives in the House of Representatives, and on Nov. 13 he wrote a guest column in USA Today saying that the nation’s $1 trillion annual deficits and $15 trillion debt require actual spending cuts, not illusory ones.

"The only way for us to do that is to end every contract on March 31, 2011," McCafferty said. "It would put people in the county behind the eight ball if everything came to a screeching halt at the end of March."
SPLIT END – Wheaton, Gwacham, Catchings. Comment: Wheaton looks poised for a monster year if he stays healthy. OSU can split him wide on both sides, fly sweep him, or put him in the slot to take advantage of mismatches. It’s always hard to tell what’s going on with Catchings (lots of physical issues). It wouldn’t be a shock if he had a big senior year, but certainly one can’t predict that based on past performance.

"I think it has helped the team because we've been able to spread the floor a little bit more with Nic, Gerald and Wesley. Now their bigs have to come out and play Nic, Wesley and Gerald as opposed to when we have our centers in there, teams are zoning, packing it in and they're able to get up and deny. So it helps to spread the floor with the smaller lineup."

Two-thirds see the economy as "poor" and about one in seven say it's somewhere in between. And just 22 percent say the economy got better in the past month, down from 28 percent saying so in February.
“We do support multiple authorizers. We think the best approach, rather than simply designating a higher education institution, may be to have institutions that are interested submit a proposal,” he said.

The district pays C&H $5,500 per year for its baseball and softball teams to use the park, which has a main baseball field and two auxiliary fields. Perkins' biggest issue with the move is whether the district's maintenance workers can keep the new field at the school playable when weather conditions turn bad. C&H has been known for its ability to host games when all other fields are unplayable.

Though west Carlsbad stretches far south, the center of action is in the little triangle that forms Frazee Park, where Carlsbad Boulevard does a squiggle to make its way inland. The lifeguard station painted a sea foam green is all boarded up – summer is officially not quite here. But on this summerlike day, everyone else is in the swing of the season to come.

"In the past, job bills, unemployment insurance, funding for education, the security of Medicare and Social Security - all those things were driven by the middle class and those who aspired to the middle class," said Grijalva, one of the most liberal members of Congress and co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. "Now, all those things are jeopardized because the agenda has shifted to those special-interest groups who right now are controlling the purse strings and are making it possible for people to be elected, and influencing those elections."

A: Not particularly, but I did hear the other day from a friend of mine who is friends with Sean Connery and apparently Sean Connery asked him to pass along to me how well he thought I was doing and how well I seem to be handling everything and making good choices. For me, that was great because he is a great actor. He had this amazing start to his career in Bond and managed to create a fantastic career for himself outside that, so to hear that from him was very flattering.

Since I don't have a Hall of Fame vote (yet), I can't tell you for sure if I'd vote for Mattingly or not. I can tell you that I covered him for the Daily News for the final four years of his career after watching him as a fan in the early part of his career. As a fan I felt I was watching one of the greatest players I'd ever seen. From 1984 until 1987, he could do it all. Hit for average. Hit for power. And play first base as well as anyone in the game. But when I covered him, I was usually writing about his decline due to injury. My most vivid recollections of Mattingly are of watching him try to stretch his ailing back hours before every game. In the four years I covered him he hit a total of 44 home runs.

Rauschenberg made 162 combines between 1954 and 1964, and they remain the most highly regarded and influential body of work by the unusually prolific artist. (During his career he produced about 6,000 unique paintings and sculptures, along with a sizable number of prints and multiples.) The largest collection of combines -- 11 works -- is housed in Los Angeles at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Chief curator Paul Schimmel organized an exhibition of 70 combines in 2005, which traveled to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and to museums in Paris and Stockholm.

"There was a game there to be won," said Orioles manager Buck Showalter, who had ripped into his team after their 13-5, sweep-completing loss to the Texas Rangers on Wednesday night. "I think we've had leads in three of the last four games we played. Jake's command was an issue. Jake is out there, and you can see it. His tempo slows down, the wheels start turning. I think he's overthinking a lot of things and he's just not getting in the rhythm of throwing the ball over the plate and trusting his stuff. It's just not very good right now."

Yet the majority of people have kids of their own. I suppose some of this majority are delusional or careless, but most just do the math and decide that having kids is worth a few (or few years) of these scenes. You need to figure out why your math is different.
In 1983, Barack Obama published an article in the Sundial at Columbia University decrying the "relentless, often silent spread of militarism in the country." The piece offered a fawning profile of disarmament groups opposing Reagan administration policies that in fact would produce, just four years later, a radical shift in Soviet policy and a treaty in which the two powers agreed to get rid off an entire class of nuclear weapons.
In an April 2 news release, Clancy-May expressed fears that without Proposition B, the district could not provide adequate funding for its programs. That raised the possibility that Bayless would lose its accreditation and be taken over by the state, Clancy-May said.
Instead, the plan is to raise €5.5 billion in a rights issue, an arrangement in which new shares are sold, typically at a discount, with priority going to existing investors. J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are underwriting it.
A. A funny thing about bare spots, what you want to grow and fill in these areas seldom does at least as quickly as weeds. If you have good grass in the depression why not remove it to form several pieces of sod? Then fill the depression with lawn soil or potting soil and add the pieces of saved grass. If necessary, you could buy a few pieces of sod to cover the soil. Avoid the frustration of seeing weeds take over this little spot in your lawn.
The choice of church was also telling - the pulpit there is manned by the Rev. Douglas Parham, the preacher leading the push against Mayor Francis Slay.
A: The Columbia Generating Station, the Northwest's only nuclear power reactor, was built 15 years after the Japanese reactors and unlike them includes a system that can keep cooling the reactor core even after a total loss of power. When the tsunami knocked out backup generators in Japan, the reactor cooling system failed, causing the disastrous overheating of fuel. If electricity fails at the Columbia Generating Station, workers can run the cooling system on steam power. The plant also has three backup diesel generators, each with enough fuel to produce electricity for seven days, said Mike Paoli, a spokesman for Energy Northwest, the company that runs the reactor. If all three generators fail, Paoli said, the plant has battery backup that can maintain cooling for 8 hours at a stretch, between rechargings by a portable diesel generator.

I'll try to summarize the pro-pet side without quoting anyone, since I love all of my readers and don't want to embarrass them. The mainstream critics said I was behaving as if my pets were disposable, and that, if nothing else, I was setting a bad example for my kids by "abandoning" the felines. Others took a more extreme view. They described the bond between animal and human as almost holy, that I was bound to either stay home or take the cats along, and that by leaving, I had broken a sacred trust.

Nearly half of California's income taxes before the recession came from the top 1% of earners: households that took in more than $490,000 a year. High earners, it turns out, have especially volatile incomes—their earnings fell by more than twice as much as the rest of the population's during the recession. When they crashed, they took California's finances down with them.
"We've always depended on hatchery salmon, and when you hear people talking about cuts you get nervous," he said. "But you look at the fish we're catching this spring, and it's hard to argue with the biologists. I just hope they really know what they're talking about."

For years this classic coconut cake from the "Silver Palate Cookbook" has been one of my favorites. In the cookbook the authors advise that the oh-so-chunky frosting be used between the layers and on top, leaving the sides "naked." I like to use a generous amount as a filling and just enough on top to cover it; then I cover the sides of the cake as well. I use a large spoon to put some in place on the side, then smooth it out with a frosting spatula. I repeat this all the way around the cake, making a thin layer to cover the side. I garnish it with fresh berries, Easter chocolates and pesticide-free Cecil Bruner roses from my yard.

It's not clear what Heimerl is referring to. But he's right in that answers are forthcoming. In October, Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner Michael Campion issued a memo outlining concerns about how the strike force handles forfeiture funds, which have averaged more than $200,000 a year for the past three years. Campion's memo said that although he had no reason to believe there had been malfeasance regarding the funds, "there may not be an adequate record system to identify the source and disposition of these funds.'' That helped trigger an expedited review of the gang strike force's policies, procedures and processes by the state's respected Office of the Legislative Auditor. That report is expected to be released in about a month. The strike force's Hawaii black-eye will boost this report's profile and should spur those involved with the strike force to heed the auditor's conclusions and take action.

The San Miguel Fire Protection District board of directors has a difficult task of deciding where the taxpayer's money is best spent. That money is what fills the water bucket of today.

That's because high-cacao dark chocolate is filled with tannins and other strong flavors, and is low in sugar.

In 2006, a team of scholars from the University of Minnesota described how easy it is for data-mining software to create detailed personal profiles of individuals—even when they post information anonymously. The software is based on a simple principle: People tend to leave lots of little pieces of information about themselves and their opinions in many different places on the Web. By identifying correspondences among the data, sophisticated algorithms can identify individuals with extraordinary precision. And it's not a big leap from there to discovering the people's names. The researchers noted that most Americans can be identified by name and address using only their ZIP Code, birthday and gender—three pieces of information that people often divulge when they register at a website.
How to kill them: No hotel should charge a mandatory resort fee. Ever. If you book a room at a hotel that has one, and it's clearly disclosed, you have few options. Trying to negotiate your way out of one when you check in is your best bet. However, few resort fees are adequately disclosed. If the hotel refuses to strike the surcharge from your bill, talk to your credit card company. I've dealt with several cases in which the fee was refunded directly by a credit card company.

Angel Red juice is darker than that of other pomegranate varieties in its season, and delightfully fruity, but not as inky as that of the standard Wonderful, which it is unlikely to displace as the standard juice variety.

The reality, however, is that the Bears aren't playing with a winning formula. Hanie has thrown nine interceptions - two of them returned for touchdowns - in the last four games. There have been too many breakdowns in pass protection, with Hanie being sacked 19 times during that stretch. And there have been untimely lapses on special teams and defense, too.

Keret writes short fiction — often, very short. It's astonishing what he can do in just two pages: go from funny to bizarre to touching to satiric to meta to surprising and surreal. There are 35 stories in this slender paperback, and sometimes they are just strange or sad or sweet enough to make you set the book down and walk away, to give them time to sink in.

The Texans losing to a good team on the road is one of the surest bets in sports. Heck, since they have just one road win in the last six seasons over a team that finished with a .500 record, I'm not sure recovery groups consider it gambling to put money against the Texans in such situations.
The tall tower is architecture's most famous building type and also the one most clearly at odds with the profession's roots. Fundamentally, architecture is shelter, a concession that we're afraid to face the elements without protection. A skyscraper is vertical hubris.

His 2009 film, "House of the Devil," was a clear throwback to '80s horror films. "Innkeepers" is more contemporary but has an old-school feel -- and appeal. A tiny budget requires creativity on the part of the filmmaker and, frankly, patience on the part of the audience. Although horror audiences expect a certain amount of shocks per scene, West doles them out far less frequently, relying instead on the considerable charms of Sara Paxton as a young woman going through what a friend describes as a quarter-life crisis to carry the audience between shocks.

Approachable though he may be, Britten (1913-76) is still clever and innovative with his vocal lines and orchestration. Instruments speak out of the relatively transparent orchestra to represent characters, as with a harp and flute joining forces to back the schoolmistress. Echoes of the complexities heard in larger-scale works like "Peter Grimes" and "A Midsummer Night’s Dream" can be heard. But as much as any other factor, for both performers and audience, the fact that the work is in English helps break down typical barriers to opera.
At least health care providers will know how to adjust their services to collect Medicaid payments, Kasich said.

Landry appeared in court Monday, but his arraignment on murder and conspiracy to commit murder was delayed until May 8. His partner-in-crime, according to prosecutors, was Saddler's 16-year-old daughter, who prosecutors say talked to Landry about what kind of gun to use and told him how to get into the family's home in the 2700 block of North Lowell Lane, near Memory Lane.

The second act picks up the day after the wedding at Claire and John's home. Justine is now so depressed she's practically catatonic. John, meanwhile, is obsessed with Melancholia, a planet hidden behind the sun that is hurtling toward Earth. Online reports predict certain disaster, but John assures an increasingly worried Claire that it will in fact miss Earth -- it will come close enough for armchair astronomers such as himself to get excited, nothing more. But is there hesitation in his voice; perhaps he's trying to convince himself. Certainly whatever he's selling, Claire isn't buying. She becomes more and more distraught, terrified at what will become of their son, Leo (Cameron Spurr).

Facing efforts by his Republican rivals to paint him as a heartless corporate raider who preyed on struggling companies while working in the world of private equity, Republican front-runner Mitt Romney stepped up his defense of his tenure at Bain Capital on Thursday -- gently pushing back against those attacks by arguing that his goal had been to make businesses successful over the long term.
But before we get too fixated on the momentary ups and downs that even the best NBA franchises go through, let's look back a moment and recognize one of the most impressive feats by a team—to be precise, by its bench—in league history.
Carnival is technically correct. Canceling your cruise just before your sail date means you're only entitled to a refund of your taxes and port fees. Had your fiance walked out on you within your cancellation period (usually about 80 days before your departure) then you could have gotten a full refund, no questions asked.

bunny that I needle-felted from a marled medium-gray wool roving. He has seed beaded eyes and an embroidery floss mouth. He is jointed. His wee arms and legs are attached with the tiniest of pink buttons. So yes, his arms, legs and head all move, but he's a little delicate - this is not a toy. He stands about 7 inches tall. You can love him, squeeze him, and I call him George. My bunny retails for $40. I also make felted cupcakes. They're ideal gifts for the woman who bakes or for cupcake lovers. They can also be used as holiday ornaments. They sell for $10 each.
That was before high gas prices, the recession and skyrocketing health care costs brought the Detroit Three to their knees.

There are many problems with the U.S. health system. But figuring out how to fix them requires a clear understanding of where we fall short.

The ugly: If our governor, who said 25 years ago that “new taxes … encourage and expand an accelerated form of government that is already quite excessive,” succeeds with his new tax increase on the November ballot, government will be authorized to take an additional $9 billion from Californians, including from “millionaires,” who, the governor reckons, include people earning as little as $250,000 a year.

Romney has promised to do this even as he plans to dramatically increase military spending - one of the biggest chunks of the budget, aside from Medicare and Social Security. How the math adds up is anyone's guess. But to appreciate just how much further to the right Romney is than all modern GOP presidents, taxes are just the beginning.

What a great idea. Having been to many activities at the present complex, and found getting there easy, parking mostly ok, and the atmosphere great, I would love seeing baseball in come to the complex. In addition, I like Hillsboro's forward thinking. The complex is on an already existing freeway, and the access roads are already good, so very little new roadwork would be needed. There is plenty of land already owned by the city. Who knows, once the facility is built, perhaps minor league soccer or football might be in the off season picture. Certainly, the use by high schools and colleges for all sorts of activities would be a given. And festivals and religious grand campaigns could be a possibility as well. This would definitely be a win for Hillsboro, a city that has already out thought its suburban
Before I get into the optimists' arguments, let me give you my evidence for gloom. When it comes to initial public offerings of stock, the nation has fallen into a massive hole, and not just in the technology sector. From a peak of 554 IPOs in 2007, we dropped to 118 last year, according to Renaissance Capital. So far there have been only 37 IPOs through Aug. 13 — and none in Silicon Valley, with the closest being San Francisco-based OpenTable's debut — compared with 108 at this point last year. Having a healthy IPO market is considered a vital ingredient to keeping the valley's innovation economy humming.

But the problem is that while the Bush administration saw and the Obama administration sees a worldwide "War on Terror" that gives the United States government license to hunt down and kill enemies, other nations aren't willing to embrace such a broad notion of a battlefield and a "war" with no end in sight. That's why they are resisting full cooperation with the United States when it comes to extraditions and Guantanamo detainees, Sorenson said.

The 1960s Rockefeller gifts of American painting remain the anchor of the de Young's painting collections, though substantial additions have lately been made in late 20th century art. The room in which Richard Diebenkorn's "Ocean Park 116" (1979), Willem de Kooning's "Untitled XX" (1977) and Sam Francis' "Helio" (1986) share a wall makes a startling snapshot of late 20th century pluralism within painting, the more so for its inclusion of a minimalist diptych by Jo Baer and an idiosyncratic figurative epic by Irving Petlin. Speaking of snapshots, a gallery devoted to photography contains, besides Catherine Wagner's clever riffs on the museum's holdings, a highly

Those types of rules are already established in Minnesota college towns such as Winona and Mankato, but as metro areas seek to try them, it could lead to a battle: property owners who can't sell their vacant houses and say they could face foreclosure if they can't rent them out vs. cities that say too many rentals can drag down everybody else's property values.

Hey, Tony: If the Browns didn't have Phil Dawson, do you think they would try harder (take more chances) to get into the end zone? Three points are better than none, but based on the plays called while in enemy territory, it seems like the Browns are playing for field goals rather than touchdowns.
