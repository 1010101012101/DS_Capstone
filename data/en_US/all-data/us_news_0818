ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr., on a conference call Thursday, said the drawback with Tannehill is that he's a former receiver who started only 19 games at quarterback. He cited his suspect performance against four ranked teams: a 59.6 completion percentage and nine picks.

A series of studies with both approaches has found the marginal value of a year of college is somewhere between 6% and 10%, according to Mark Long, an economist at the University of Washington, and other researchers. Earning a diploma confers a bit of a bonus, because it is necessary for some licenses and because it signals to employers a higher level of readiness. That adds up to a lifetime earnings increase of between $300,000 and $600,000 for completing college—for the typical worker. Many of these studies are from a decade ago or longer, and some economists think the true benefit has grown because of a greater demand for skilled labor.

There is also some misunderstanding about President Harry Truman's executive order of 1948, calling for equality in the armed forces, which is often cited as a model that President Barack Obama should follow. No doubt Truman's action was a landmark in the civil rights struggle. However, the order was not actually sufficient inducement for the armed forces to do the right thing.

In my petition I referred to my previous address to the council where I said the mayor abused his power by going to Springfield on Feb. 25, 2010, with the mayors from Edwardsville, Fairview Heights, Maryville and Troy, of which none are the weak-mayor form of government. First, they went to the Illinois Municipal League office for a Capital for a Day program where a picture was taken of them along with Rep. Jay Hoffamn for the IML state-wide magazine. The article said they came to Springfield, in part, to have their concerns heard on pending Star Bond legislation.

AT&T has apologized and said it will notify all iPad users whose e-mail addresses may have been accessed. It noted that the only information hackers would have been able to steal using the attack were users' e-mail addresses. But that can be enough to launch an effective attack, since the attacker also knows that the person receiving the e-mail is an iPad user and an AT&T customer and would expect to receive e-mail from Apple and AT&T about their accounts. Criminals could use that knowledge to trick them into opening e-mails that plant malicious software on their computers.

Les Carpenter, Yahoo! Sports: "Whatever magic lived for two blessed months in the frantic autumn of 2011 was gone on the first day of 2012, replaced with the awkward uncertainty of a team led by a quarterback who has become something less than ordinary. Percentages have evened out. The outlandish can't happen every week and, robbed of his powers to make miracles, Tim Tebow's Broncos have become what the scoreboard said: 7-3 losers to the Kansas City Chiefs. And this isn't the way you want to be marching into the postseason. No player in the NFL is as confounding as the man who came to save the Broncos for seven of eight weeks. He can be at times a contortionist, pulling Denver from sure defeats, and also overmatched, looking like a man who shouldn't play another game in the NFL."

"I'd like to go talk to Balash about it," he said. "I don't feel I did anything wrong. Any replay that shows us going into the trioval will show the splitter smoking (from the tire going flat).

I'd just like to make a comment about the city of St. Louis supposedly going to eliminate about 80 police officers. I think we can all tell by the crime that's on TV every day how bad it's getting in the city of St. Louis. I think instead of reducing by 80 officers we should be putting on about 80 officers.
"I'm surely qualified there," he said. "One if the issues I'm concerned about is I don't see a lot of opportunities for small businesses or minority contractors, in particular."
Blood pressure also should be measured standing as well as sitting or lying down.

The rich lamb daube ($22), its chunks of meat braised in wine from Chateauneuf-du-Pape, is another dish that captures the essence of the region. Stained almost black from the wine, the big chunks begin to flake apart as you work your fork through to incorporate the rich gravy, baby turnips and carrots. A drizzle of rosemary oil completes this beautifully rustic dish.

HULA HOOP 2.0 "Mine is 3 pounds. I don't think I could do it with a kids' hoop anymore. It's almost easier when it's heavier. They have a fabric that seems easier to use. It takes a little time to build up, though; at first, I almost felt bruised. And I change positions; I don't just stand there and hoop; I try to incorporate arm and leg movements for strength, as well. I'll do a deeper plié squat that focuses on legs as well as core. I have noticed that my waist is stronger and definitely smaller, but what surprised me more is that it has had a definite effect on my legs, particularly my quads."

Since the 1980s, Japanese automakers such as Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mazda have dramatically increased their production capacity in the United States, including facilities in Fremont, Long Beach and Ontario that employ more than 6,000 Californians. Today, two out of every three Japanese nameplate cars sold in the United States are made domestically rather than imported. Every one of the top 10 selling models of cars and light trucks in the U.S. are made in this country. Detroit's real competition is not factories in Japan but in California, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi and South Carolina.

In the R-rated thriller, Poe, a sardonic, tortured artist, teams up with a police detective (Luke Evans of "Immortals") to search for a serial killer whose crime spree is re-creating the particulars of Poe's stories. The moody visual chills are provided by director James McTeigue, whose debut was the stylish "V for Vendetta." But the scary details are largely from Poe's mind, which could mean the movie will inspire some future trips to the library.

No reindeer, she. Olivia is a striking brindle with markings that compare to a tiger's - and with the spunk, spit and vigor to match. Because she is such a polar opposite of Elvis, I wonder: Will I ever love Olivia as much as I loved Elvis?

Mr. Dundee later teamed with Foreman in 1994 to help him become the oldest heavyweight champion at age 45 when he beat Michael Moorer. In one last attempt to help a big fighter win a big fight, Dundee helped train Oscar De La Hoya for his Dec. 6, 2008, fight with pound-for-pound king Manny Pacquiao. Dundee did not work the corner on fight night; perhaps the 35-year-old "Golden Boy" could have used him. De La Hoya declined to answer the bell for the ninth round.

Tramon Williams, who leads the Packers with six interceptions, keeps making the kind of plays that turn games in Green Bay's favor. Charles Woodson isn't playing as well as he did when he was named Defensive Player of the Year in 2009, but he moves seamlessly from cornerback to the slot, and his frequent blitzing gave the Bears fits in the regular-season finale at Lambeau Field.
A year after finishing ninth aboard Pants on Fire, the best finish ever by a female jockey in the Kentucky Derby, Rosie Napravnik does not have a ride. She was supposed to ride Mark Valeski, but the colt was pulled from the race because trainer Larry Jones did not think he could compete.
How, then, do the Coens follow up this moment on the mountaintop? With a lark, a goof, a playfully unpretentious throwaway. "Burn After Reading," from an original story by the Coens, has about as much chance of winning an Oscar as "The House Bunny." But it revels in the kind of moments that make the Coens so Coenesque.

It was ironic to see your April 12 editorial seeking to explain youth unemployment ("Wanted: Jobs for the next gen") without mentioning the current problem's main cause, which was separately addressed in a column on the very next page: the minimum wage. Increases in the minimum wage hurt the young most of all by preventing companies from hiring them at reduced rates. And if the young do not learn job skills — showing up on time, accountability, attention to detail — when they are still young, they never do. Imagine the terrible habits you would develop if you were unemployed for several years after becoming eligible for the workforce. Those who go through this misfortune risk being a long-term drag on the economy.

That statement by Governor O'Malley gives me no comfort that the "reasonable" standard has been reached.
