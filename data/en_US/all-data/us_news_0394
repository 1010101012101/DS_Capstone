In fact it was the C grades in the character categories that marred my final fifth-grade report card. I tried to get away with not writing out, in its entirety, "Paul Revere's Ride." The rest of the class completed the task, but I skipped some of the verses. As a result, on the last day of fifth grade, I found myself in the back of the convent completing the assignment. Sister Ann Marian, however, in sympathy, did leave some ice cream for me at the back of the convent door. So ended fifth grade!

The plan was hatched after a task force commissioned by Gov. Chris Christie overstepped its mission to evaluate how to merge Rutgers with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.

But high school coaches already know what to look for in a boy: One who pays attention when a coach speaks. One who shows flexibility and power when he moves, especially in his hips and ankles. A kid with legs like tree stumps -- one thickness from calves to ankles -- will never be fast. But one with long, lean legs, especially his calves, is built for speed.

The National Clinical Guideline Center in London found that monitoring the blood pressure of older people in their homes instead of in doctors' offices is a better option, saving a patient nearly $600 over his or her lifetime and providing a better quality of life.

Are there problems with the institution of marriage? Sure there are. There are pressures and distractions from many sources, including trying to balance raising a family when both parents work. These can be very stressful when confronting something as predictable as a snow day or a bout with the flu. Other challenges take the form of substance abuse and the plethora of media confronting us. But these problems do not justify or require the redefinition of marriage to include same-sex unions.

Congress has a chance to break this deadlock, but the signs aren't encouraging. Two bills on Capitol Hill would repeal the grandfather exemptions for older gas lines. But a third one, by Rep.

Just as will be the case if the Supreme Court strikes down all or part of “Obamacare,” a court decision against the administration in the Arizona dispute will land the issue squarely in the center of the presidential election debate.

"They had matted hair, they were covered in feces, confined in wire cages, their teeth are rotting, they're out in the cold and heat with no shelter," Kelly Backes said.
What’s interesting is that the opponents on both sides share a common assumption: Religion can only be what it has always been. Change is unacceptable. But why should we accept that assumption? Haven’t humans always brought their own values to their quest for God? Haven’t we always sought to make our belief systems relevant? Each new development in science, philosophy and culture calls for rethinking our faith (or our nonfaith) -- no matter what we happen to believe. Isn’t it a good thing, for example, to try to purify our religions from inherited racism or sexism or Eurocentrism?

The firm did not have to compete in a public bid against nonprofit developers, as is typically required.

To me, all of that makes perfect sense. Whether they have papers or not, immigrants are rational. As a general rule, they don't come here to commit crimes; they could do that at home if they wanted. They don't come here to laze around and enjoy government benefits because, well, what benefits would those be? They come to work.
Higher energy prices have some economists lowering their growth forecasts for the first three months of the year. They said high energy prices will slow consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity.

Now that schools are peanut-free, latex-free and soda-free, parents, administrators and teachers have got to worry about something. Since most kids now have access to cable TV, the Internet, unlimited talk and texting, college and a world of opportunities that was unimaginable even 20 years ago, it seems that adults have responded by becoming ever more overprotective and thin-skinned.

The best thing in the film is McAdams, who moves through her post-amnesia scenes with a plausible mix of good humor and wariness. Her character retains our sympathy even when she's making other people's lives difficult, and you can see why Tatum's Leo clings to her for dear life. He's well cast as a burly lug who married far above his station. Despite that "nobody's home" air of his, he projects an uncomplicated decency, and you feel for him when McAdams' disapproving parents (the underutilized Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) show him no love.

Blazers interim general manager Chad Buchanan said Portland, under current collective bargaining rules, would have an advantage in trying to retain Felton after he becomes a free agent next summer. The Blazers would hold what's called "early Bird rights" to Felton, which would allow them to raise his salary 10.5 percent each season, whereas other teams would only be able to increase it by 8 percent each season. The Blazers would also be allowed to sign Felton to one more season than other teams.

Where my ancestors came from matters, because in the Middle East -- which I love completely -- everything is geographical.

As I read her book, I kept thinking: This is my country too. And yet for Cortas, the greatest disaster was the founding of Israel -- also, supposedly, my country.

He adopted the songgun, or "military first" policy, pouring ever scarcer resources into the development of weapons of mass destruction.

If you're looking for a place to make an appointment with Oregon's late-arriving spring, there's a south-facing terrace at Jory, the restaurant at the Allison Hotel & Spa in Newberg, that seems destined for a rendezvous.

With a well-concocted mix of shudders, titters and, yes, sorrow, the R-rated "The Cabin the Woods" teases this set-up, turns the joke on its head and also makes sure audiences know that something really is at stake for the characters, as well as for us.
