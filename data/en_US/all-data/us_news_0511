Here's the deal ... we don't know if the Rams would run a version of the Coryell offense. And the "Coryell Offense" can take on many forms, many personalities. The Washington Redskins won Super Bowls and were a true NFL heavyweight under head coach Joe Gibbs, who used the Coryell foundation. But Gibbs emphasized the H Back and beefed up the offensive line, and the Coryell formations, motions and personnel groupings morphed into a power-running attack led by John Riggins and The Hogs up front.

Hey, Brian: It seems unfair that LeBron is getting blamed for not speaking up for Izzo. If you are in LeBron's shoes, you don't want to commit to a team yet, and you certainly don't want to choose the coach for a team you may not play for. LeBron has earned his free agency, why is there so much animosity towards him for not choosing the Cavs coach? -- Chris Schirk, Portland, Maine

NEWARK -- The Evolution Soccer Club should not be winning.
The Pioneers seemed to occasionally lack passion, perhaps thinking things might come too easily with some top-end talent. The final game, against the Bulldogs, was something of a microcosm of the whole season. DU looked a little less hungry than smaller-school Ferris State in the first two-thirds of the game, and by the time the Pioneers got just as desperate for a win as the Bulldogs, it was too late.

"And without a clear basis for making a judgment call whether a festival will be good or bad, things can get out of hand.

Such a mix would be a stretch at many restaurants, but this newcomer in Locust Point's McHenry Row development handles its far-ranging menu with competence and panache. Our entrees included a Korean spicy pork hot plate, a Massaman curry, a pad Thai and a Cantonese-style salt-and-pepper fried seafood. They all came over well. Each cuisine is distinct, but all feel that they belong on the same table. The impressive thing is how natural these dishes feel together, given their different pedigrees.
THOMAS: Yes, they can ask the grandmother about her status. The police need no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to ask any question of any person, so long as officers do not create the impression that answers are required. The police may be able to determine the grandmother's immigration status simply by asking her questions like where she was born and how she came to the U.S. If the grandmother does not admit to being undocumented, law enforcement may still determine immigration status based on a totality of the circumstances. Relevant considerations include clothing, language used and accent, the location of the encounter, origin and destination of travel and behavior of the individuals.

Back out the excise taxes and you get a taxable gas price of $2.84, which would make the added sales tax 17 cents. (This differs from the 18 cents Dresser used because gas prices have risen since Jan. 1, but I wanted to compare apples/apples using the API ranking.) Add 17 cents to the 41.9 cents that Marylanders now pay in gas tax and you get 58.9 cents per gallon.

He draws a loving and critical portrait of the awesome and awful fantasyland that actually existed in that time and place.

A friend called and asked if our son could help with some yard work. Sundays can be lazy afternoons in a preacher's house so her request came at a good time. We spend time together eating lunch and then launch into heavy siesta time. That usually leaves him longing for something to do. If it has been a while since you've spent time with middle school boys, think Newtonian physics. Remember: a body in motion tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. In this case, however, the promise of a little extra money was exactly the outside force needed to channel that energy into a good direction.

So what we prefer to do is have them drinking nothing but water and trying to isolate their snack into one particular time.

Makeup trends cycle back and forth between the lips and the eyes. When one is having a moment, the other takes a back seat.

U.S. sales of lip color neared $290 million in 2011, a more than 13% increase from 2010, according to market research firm NPD Group. Lip gloss sales dipped roughly 1%, to about $182 million.

Lumahai: A small, gorgeous and sometimes dangerous beach. It was featured in the movie version of “South Pacific” and can be reached only by a sometimes muddy trail leading off the road just west of Hanalei. It’s the hidden tropical fantasy that everyone thinks of when they visit Hawaii. Be aware that the surf can be dangerous, especially any time other than summer. People have been swept to sea off the famous rock ledge. Best to sit up high on the sloping beach and enjoy the scenery.

Director Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black bring a healthy measure of sophistication to this time-jumping biopic of the pioneering and controversial FBI director. But while Leonardo DiCaprio gives a game performance as Hoover, the demands of the character's accent and old-age makeup mean that there's a cartoon at the center of a movie meant to serious. That blunder aside, "J. Edgar" is a thoughtful study of how the pathologically private Hoover snooped into the lives of others, partly in the name of national security and partly to avenge the slights against his crime-busting methods when he was an ambitious young agent. The DVD and Blu-ray cover more of Hoover's life via a featurette.
Johnson had his best performance of the exhibition season in the Blazers' 118-105 victory over the Golden State Warriors Saturday night, when he finished with 14 points, five rebounds, two assists and zero turnovers in 17 minutes.

"With Oran, it starts with his ability to attack the line of scrimmage and break tackles," Eagles coach Blair Hubbard said. "Then he has the speed to break away and get those big gains.

I so enjoyed Frank's tax tutorial last week. As he was quick to point out, President and Mrs. Obama reported income of approximately $790,000 on which they paid an effective tax rate of 20.5 percent or $162,000. Their charitable contributions of $172,000, mainly to Fisher House Foundation which provides scholarships to veteran's children, did reduce their tax bill as noted by Frank in his column. I searched in vain for Frank's analysis of taxes paid by the Republican Presidential candidate Mitt More Money but maybe there was no such analysis because the Romney family did not file a return and instead filed for an extension. Now, there is nothing wrong with doing that, I guess, but Frank could have looked at Mr. Romney's 2010 tax return, disclosed earlier this year after much criticism was leveled on Mr. Romney's reticence in revealing this information. Frank would have found that Mitt paid an effective rate of 14 percent on his $27 million of income holding many millions of dollars in a Swiss bank account and in partnerships in the Cayman Islands. By the way, the 14% rate is what family's earning $80,000 usually pay. Also Frank would have noted that the Romney family paid only one tenth of 1 percent of their income in payroll taxes while the average wage earner in the United States pays 6 percent of their income on these taxes. By the way, the Romneys' charitable contributions are mainly made to the Mormon Church.

A man standing at the corner of Linnet and Bosworth fired into the passenger side of the car. Sherwon was shot in the forehead.
For all that, the campaign was far from a sure thing. In 1997, a transit expansion called “Guide the Ride” tanked with 58 percent of voters saying no. It was criticized as too vague.
Ohio's overall slide in exports -- 25 percent -- was more severe than the nation's 18 percent drop.
With bursts of humor that had the audience in the Taylor Meade Performing Arts Center laughing at unexpected moments, Dr. Yong Zhao explained to more than 100 eager listeners what he thinks is wrong with American education — and what can be done at a local level to fix it.

For my first trip to the Maryland MVA, I brought a letter from the U.S. Postal Service, an electric bill and a signed printout I had from my bank on letterhead with my new Baltimore address and information on my account.

"When I started here, there were no trees yet in the park," he says, looking toward a big tree with white blossoms outside the Palace Theater. "It's almost hard to believe I've been here longer than that tree. But I feel blessed to be able to really get to know our guests and give them the best experience we can. And every year, we do it again."
"It wasn't a do-or-die start," Scioscia said. "Hopefully, he'll continue to move forward. Right now, it makes sense to give the guys an extra day rather than jam the rotation," by skipping Williams in favor of ace Weaver.
European airlines have no such restrictions. For years, no-frills discount airlines have added these credit card fees to their ticket prices. But now the larger carriers like British Airways, Lufthansa and Swiss are catching up.
Now, some may think that there are already plenty of plays in the world and that Cleveland has nothing particularly special to contribute in that regard. But thought leaders in the Northeast Ohio theater universe would beg to differ.

About 2,250 runners are expected to tackle the 26.2-mile marathon. They will be joined at the starting line at 14th and Market streets by more than 10,600 runners competing in the half-marathon and 2,000 in the marathon relay. The front of the half-marathon field could be crowded because a half-dozen men are capable of running 1:10:00 and a handful of women could break 1:20:00 over the 13.1-mile course. The relay event includes teams of four runners, each completing approximately 6½ miles of the marathon course, and is a sellout.
"The classic sommelier position isn't the same as it was," Parr says.
"Merchandise is such a visual medium. It's easier to merchandise off of a movie versus a book, which is probably why so few books have a merchandise line, especially in the novel form," Dravis says.

In 1996, he appeared before the Senate's Special Committee on Aging to urge more federal funds for depression research, saying that he had felt "lower, lower, lower than a snake's belly" but had recovered through psychiatry and antidepressant drugs. He later disclosed that he once tried to commit suicide during that dark period. Wallace, columnist Art Buchwald and author William Styron were friends who commiserated often enough about depression to call themselves "The Blues Brothers," according to a 2011 memoir by Styron's daughter, Alexandra.
Gillerman was born in St. Louis as Fay Kandel, living with parents Simon and Bessie, "dirt poor immigrants, one from Russia and the other from Poland." After graduating from the defunct Ben Blewett High School on Enright Avenue, she married Bill Gillerman in 1941.

The fish kill began in an area near the Cleveland Metroparks toboggan run in the Mill Stream Run Reservation. Fish were soon dying in a three-mile stretch of river between the Bonnie Park Area and Wallace Lake in Berea. Ohio EPA officials reportedly found a few dead steelhead trout where the East Branch joins the Rocky River. The Rocky River is a noted steelhead trout stream, with the lake-run steelhead providing excellent fishing during the cold-weather months.
No one ever wants the wedding day to end. In the midst of pictures, toasts and cake-cutting, every bride and groom wishes for time to slow down. So couples are now coordinating elaborate wedding after-parties so they can have their cake and really enjoy it, too — sometimes into the wee hours of the morning.

The bad: Cheaper Blu-ray players offer many of the same Internet-viewing options plus disc playback; video quality varies from channel to channel; setup and content queues usually require at least some PC interaction; no access to PC- and USB-based media; lacks YouTube support.
That work cannot be done without a much larger commitment of state dollars than this year's stadium-distracted legislators were willing to make. The Capitol deserves to become the 2013 equivalent of this year's stadium bill -- a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build something enduring and grand in the service of the public good.
That night I went to a neighborhood party, the standard Colorado Springs west side gathering — teachers, Colorado College and public radio employees, a midwife, an organic farmer. Brandy, the hostess, happily showed me the studio her husband had designed and built in the yard of their tiny, slightly crumbling homestead.
In politics, there are no "do-overs."
To qualify for a Phanatic school visit, students report their progress to their teachers, who, in turn, tell the Phillies how the children have done in their reading endeavors. From that progress report, the top performing classrooms/schools are selected for a Phanatic visit.

What he has done in the playoffs, however, is on another level: Two games, 13 catches for 280 yards and four touchdowns. But Nicks isn’t using his plump palms to pat himself on the back. Not yet.
For a school such as Missouri Baptist, which is just starting a stronger push into distance learning, the new rule is a particular challenge. Distance learning is still a small piece of business for the school, which focuses on the St. Louis area and draws 90 percent of its students from Missouri and Illinois. With online students in nearly a dozen states, there is potential for growth.

"It was probably the biggest opener I've ever had as far as the people in the race," she said. "The No. 1 time in the world was in my season opener. I wanted to maybe get a lit bit faster, but there are plenty more chances."
Other forms of dementia include Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Frontotemporal degeneration. These are respectively the No. 2 and 3 causes of dementia, because of brain degeneration behind Alzheimer's disease. In addition to memory impairment, which can affect both of these disorders, Dementia with Lewy Bodies can be associated with hallucinations and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, while Frontotemporal degeneration can be associated with language or behavioral changes.
Immigration activists say they are not worried about decreasing numbers at rallies because their focus the last few years has been more on getting eligible immigrants to become U.S. citizens and vote.

Lt. Governor Lee Fisher is turning to an old friend to help him in his bid for the U.S. Senate race: President Bill Clinton.
Hamilton, who turns 31 on May 21, had the talk shows buzzing in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex this spring when he said he didn't owe a hometown discount to the Rangers in his contract negotiations. An All-Star all four seasons in Texas, he was the 2010 AL MVP. And the Rangers have prospered, winning back-to-back pennants and becoming one of the elite franchises in baseball.
The state occupational health investigation agency cited the city for four worker safety violations, three considered serious, after finding that commanders lost track of Engine 26 and that the battalion chief who eventually went after them did so alone and without staying in contact with commanders or other firefighters.

But a freak-type injury is exactly what it was. The plan all along has been to have the legs to beat the Miami Heat, and with all the time Rose had missed, he just didn't have the legs or stamina yet to make that a reality. The first few rounds of the playoffs were supposed to be the remedy to that. Now the lingering thought is they will just be a sad reminder of what could've been.
Mindful that Target shoppers may not be able to indulge in wholesale redecorating projects in a tough economy, Berkus said his collection can be added to, over time, and layered into existing rooms and decor.

That is almost certainly why games will be on television nearly around the entire calendar week, beginning with the coming season. The risk of over-exposure will be offset by the revenue from them that will help build a fund for what might be an epic legal settlement.
Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice contended that had Wal-Mart been found guilty of a crime, the maximum penalty it could have faced was a $10,000 fine. Instead, the store agreed to a $400,000 compensation fund for victims and donated $1.5 million to county social services programs and nonprofit groups.
"I underestimated the political environment that I was operating under," Gascon recently told reporters about the commission rejecting his request last year.
Here's one example: A single person with one child under 17 who had $8,000 in wages could qualify for $2,729 for the federal earned income credit, plus another $750 for an additional child tax credit. That would add up to $3,479 for a federal refund.

There are moments when you travel that you just want to bottle, when you want time to stand still so you can drink in the sights and the sounds and the smells. For me that time in the Taller Del Sol was such a moment.
WASHINGTON -- Mired in economic worry, Americans are growing gloomier about where the country is headed and how President Barack Obama is leading it. Opinions of the economy are at the lowest of the year as high gas prices, anemic hiring and financial turmoil abroad shake a nation's confidence.

A less happy pairing was a somewhat sloppily played Adagietto from Mahler’s Symphony No. 5, with languid, expressive choreography by Royston Maldoom and flesh-toned costumes by Cecilia Doidge. The Allergretto Scherzevole from Louis Scarmolin’s Sinfonieta in A Major also sounded under-prepared.

Bees also help pollinate scores of fruit and vegetable crops, a service that's estimated to be worth $15 billion to the agricultural industry. In California alone, growers rely on honeybees to pollinate 90 crops, including avocado, almond, cherry and plum trees as well as vegetables grown from seeds. In the absence of plentiful bees, California growers could be forced to spend about $250 million renting bees to fertilize their crops.
Dried fruits like raisins and cranberries also tend to stay in all the nooks and crannies of your teeth. They're very nutritious, and I encourage parents to do that, but we recommend giving them some water afterward and trying to get them to swish it around as best they can to dislodge some of that.
The Administration has told us they do not really know who the rebels are, but they are considering arming them nonetheless. The fact that they are even thinking about arming these rebels makes one think they know exactly who the rebels are.
On this clear Saturday evening in 2002, however, the gate was up and the lights were off. It looked safe. But just as McArthur-Elliott was crossing the tracks, she later testified, a Burlington Northern Santa Fe locomotive came roaring out of nowhere. She floored the accelerator in her Ford Escort.

These population surges, as well as those in towns such as Toms River and Lakewood over the past decade, mean state lawmakers should keep an eye on the shifts, said Robert Curvin, a distinguished policy fellow at Rutgers’ Edward J.

In Cuyahoga, a few cities already share dispatching for fire and paramedics. In other areas, communities are studying the possibility of consolidating.
Upper Freehold officials were so adamantly against a center within that municipality’s borders, they passed a law tailored to keep such a facility out. It’s hard to fathom such stubborn resistance to a center that would provide not only relief to those struggling with debilitating pain from glaucoma, cancer or multiple sclerosis but also jobs for the community.
In Ohio, homeowners in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure received automated calls from a company offering to help obtain new loans or loan modifications. After paying $1,800 or more, they got nothing.

Hey, Justin: The overriding point is that any new offense is going to take time to develop. One obvious difference is the Bills caught lightning in the bottle with Ryan Fitzpatrick, a late-blooming quarterback with many years experience in the NFL.
"FDA has said the collaborative, stakeholder process is a more efficient way of achieving these goals than the process being forced by the court," the AHI statement said. "It is unfortunate that time and resources will now be diverted to responding to the court decision."
LONG BEACH — Police have arrested the boyfriend of a woman found dead in a North Long Beach home Wednesday.
Subtract the political subtext of Python, and it's short leap to the "Wallace & Gromit" shorts and cinephile homage of "Chicken Run." Aardman's latest movie, "The Pirates! Band of Misfits,"made as always using puppets painstakingly posed on elaborate, miniature sets, is an even shorter leap. If you can hold your nose at the odd capitulations made in the name of generic Hollywood conformity — an unnecessary 3-D palate, a brashly anachronistic soundtrack — you still have a story of a pirate who has a dodo bird instead of a parrot and finds himself butting heads with Charles Darwin. In Chicago recently, we asked Lord to explain everything going on in a single production still.

Not everyone is sold on the idea that the high sale price for the Dodgers will have an effect on how interested the league is in returning to the nation's No. 2 market, or the urgency of bringing a team back after being gone 17 years. It's difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison of a franchise sale in baseball and football.
Furlow has a creative splash in mind already. On the Wall, she plans to mount 2 ft.X 2 ft. displays representing the 30-plus professional theaters that perform in this area. The theaters might put together photo collages, programs, ticket stubs, quotes from favorite playwrights - anything that speaks to their artistic mission and includes the theater's name somewhere in the piece.
“We got away with it a little bit trying to put Antrel Rolle down in the box last year, but it’s tough for a safety to get down and play that third receiver, because those guys are good as well. With three receivers it’s like three starters for those guys.”

The VI Congress of Cuba's Communist Party approved a wide array of pro-market economic reforms. Their details have not been disclosed at the time of this writing, but some well-placed Cuba watchers say the new rules are likely to lead to an economic opening, much like China's economic reforms of 1978 or Vietnam's transition to a "socialist-oriented market economy" in 1986.

Let's examine the statistics:
The Devils list Kovalchuk as day to day with a “lower body injury,” but the specifics of the winger’s back injury were confirmed by two people familiar with the diagnosis. They requested anonymity because NHL teams rarely, if ever, elaborate on such details — and are not required to by league rules.
Without Clackamas Community College's program for teen parents, she isn't sure where she would be. Certainly not on track to finish high school. Probably still struggling to handle her bipolar disorder.
The side sessions, the spring games, the discussions need to translate. It doesn't have to be measured in wins and losses, but in steady progress. The Rockies have seen two critical pieces dissolve before their eyes the past two seasons. Ubaldo Jimenez went from the All-Star Game to a fourth starter. His contract, or lack thereof, played a role in his mind-set, and his lack of communication made it hard to get him straightened out. That's not on Apodaca.
For the fourth time this young season the Padres have a losing streak of at least three straight games working Tuesday night as they host the Milwaukee Brewers in the second game of a three-game series at Petco Park (7:05 p.m., TV: Fox San Diego; Radio: 1090-AM).
A story posted today by a reporter from the magazine Mother Jones contains a transcript from a leaked audio recording made at a closed-door speech to conservative donors in Colorado, in which Christie said Oliver asked him for Republican support to protect her leadership position if enraged Democrats tried to oust her. In turn, Christie delivered, asking surprised Republicans to back Oliver if there was such a coup attempt, which never materialized.

Closing the NTC will mean about $750,000 in annual savings to the Denver Center. Thompson will spend about a third of that savings replacing what he got for free from the NTC students, including understudy duties. A silver lining, said Thompson: "Clearly we'll be reaching out to the local community of actors more than we ever have before."
I like the Tucson property, which is difficult to fully describe because it keeps escaping its destination spa pigeonhole. Founders Mel and Enid Zuckerman call it a health resort and vacation destination dedicated to healthy living.

Three-time World Cup giant slalom champion Ted Ligety of Park City, Utah, was one of the favorites entering the slalom event, but he went wide on a turn in his first run and was out of the race.
Maybe she didn't quite connect with Creedence Clearwater Revival's Fortunate Son; maybe she brought an unnecessary bit of Las Vegas and Broadway to her rendition of Dusty Springfield's You Don't Have to Say You Love Me.

The District's loss is Stumptown's gain.

Teen child-bearing has been generally on a long-term decline in the United States since the late 1950s, but the United States continues to have one of the highest such rates among industrialized countries.

In much of eastern North America, local worm faunas disappeared when glaciers scraped away the topsoil. Exotic worms, beginning with those that reached Jamestown, Va., in the 1600s in a load of ballast, invaded ecosystems free of earthworm-level processes. Their activity has endangered some native plants in the upper Midwest. Out here, the exotics' impact has been less dramatic, and some natives are holding their own.
So let's say 12 a year is a good figure. What are the odds that two of those students will die on the same day? There is a famous problem in statistics called, ironically enough, "The Birthday Problem." It asks, if you gather X number of people in a room, what are the odds of two sharing the same birthday? It's a useful problem because it illustrates the unexpected ways probability can work. With 365 days a year, many - maybe most - would assume you need a large number of people in a room to have good odds of two sharing a birthday - 100, or 180, or 300. The true number is 23; with 23 people, the odds are better - 50.73 percent to be exact - that two will be born on the same day than two won't.

"There really is not a standard that every company follows as it relates to pre-existing damage," says Bob Barton, the organization's president. "Every company, however, does go through an inspection of the vehicle with the customer prior to departure and affords the customer the opportunity to point out any pre-existing damage that the rental agent has not identified."
Joyful and somewhat pugnacious clangor, after all, is an essential part of the American experimental tradition in music. It was implanted there from the beginning by Charles Ives, who had a personal fondness for this sort of thing, and strengthened through the generations by the better strains of the American national character, including rugged individualism and a certain disdain for decorum.
The beverage bunch seems to be correct that the devices would detect alcohol at below the legal limit. Sarah Ferguson, a leader of the joint venture between the Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that is directing research on the concept, concedes this point. In 2009, she told a columnist with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the devices would be set with a safety margin because it's better to "erroneously stop an innocent than to erroneously permit a drunk." That's worrisome. But I suspect that if the devices were set too far below the legal limit, they would cause popular outrage -- and the program would be too politically unpopular to ever be approved.
Her college troupe's fire show is as impressive as any you're likely to see in a carnival or circus, but the last one I saw gave me unexpected insight into an entirely unrelated subject: the fragile nature of eyewitness testimony.

"We found the resources, built the stadiums, the airports, bridges, roads, interchanges, renovated hospitals and now they are telling us: boycott Euro," Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov said Monday.

"It's been my experience that TV executives are pretty cynical about how TV audiences react to race," Deggans wrote. "And the last thing ABC wants is a cycle of 'The Bachelor,' topped by a minority male, where audiences watch less and less, providing an embarrassing display and hobbling a key franchise."

— "The Matrix" (1999): The ultimate popcorn movie. I accompanied a friend to the premiere with no idea what I was walking into and had about as much fun as I've ever had in a movie theater. Spectacular, mind-bending premise which provides the seductive setting for a story delivered with style and precision and more shell casings than all the "Rambo" movies combined. The sequels never quite lived up to this promise, but I can't hold that against this perfect piece of wired-action pie.

Like it or not, that's what fans expect to see at a NASCAR race. That doesn't make it right, and it's certainly not fair to the drivers and teams who prefer pure racing without any gimmicks. Unfortunately, that doesn't appeal to a broad enough audience, at least not for an extended period of time.
"There is a big difference between the way most Democratic governors approach their jobs and the way a new crop for Republican governors approach their job," O’Malley said.
Monday's finding could be challenged in court because of its sequence, Leo said. Already, Trina Solar maintains that it rushed panels into the United States not to beat potential tariffs but to beat the Dec. 31, 2011, expiration of a federal grant program.

Unsurprisingly, he finds an affinity as well with Alpine scenes, among them paintings of Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn and the Jungfrau. Here, he loosens up and adopts an almost divisionist or pointillist application of brushwork and rawer, more vibrant color. Two of these paintings, "Les Haut Sierra" and "Le Grand Pic Blanc," were shown at the Paris salon while he was in France and showed the contrast between his images of Swiss peaks and California mountains. Apparently the French preferred his Alpine scene to the California one, awarding it a prize.

Despite her hooded personality, she's capable of stunning surprises. It's been a good while since I've seen a movie whose most powerful sequence was both unforeseen and entirely unpredictable as it played out. Or, for that matter, a movie whose climax ran so counter to carefully nourished expectations. I'd already imagined the outcome by the time Mia went off to confront her fate, but the filmmaker had a much better idea. (She also had a fine cast that includes Kierston Wareing as Mia's mother, and strong support from the cinematographer, Robbie Ryan, who has a great eye for industrial landscapes, the production designer, Helen Scott, and the editor, Nicolas Chaudeurge.)

Im just like you. I have the same "bucket list" that every other sports fan does. I want to go to Augusta just as badly as I want to go to Lambeau.

Miller previously owned the 4 Star Gallery on Mass Ave., where for 12 years he hosted exhibits -- the kind you walk into and look around but usually don't buy from, and he also produced "happenings" like Indy Installation Fest.

The state of Oregon sent Adrianna to Mexico and had legal responsibility for her well-being. But an investigation by The Oregonian shows that the state's monitoring of her welfare was limited to occasional phone calls -- mostly to her abusers -- and unquestioning dependence on welfare workers in Mexico.
