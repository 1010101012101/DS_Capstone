To get that voice heard, Shires did what so many contemporary singer-songwriters have done over the past few years: She said goodbye to her hometown and relocated to Nashville.

A: It is easy to get pigeonholed. That's why I never went full time into the adult-film industry – it's hard to do a porn flick on Monday, then Shakespeare in the Park on Tuesday.
In July 2010, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin sued the federal government to force a temporary closing of the locks until other carp-control methods could be put in place. Critics, however, alleged that the effort was "politically motivated" and could devastate the regional shipping industry and put residents who live in flood-prone areas at risk.
"Look, I know what kind of player and person Tim Tebow is. If Tim Tebow is here next year, I'm going to be the best teammate he has. If another opportunity presents itself, them I'm going to wish him the best whereever he goes."
The script draws on facts while incorporating composite characters to depict diverse passengers and crew, and a wonderful cast brings them to life. As Second Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, Kenneth More is affectingly natural during Lightoller's moments with his wife before the ship's departure, and that warmth lingers as he briskly oversees the launching of the lifeboats; turning to witness a father refrain from waking his sleeping son to say goodbye, he seems stunned by the enormity of the tragedy. Other sensitive performers include Laurence Naismith as Capt. Edward John Smith and Michael Goodliffe as the ship's designer, Thomas Andrews, and in smaller parts, George Rose as an intoxicated baker and Kenneth Griffith as a wireless operator who mishandles ice warnings, then doggedly stays at his post as long as possible.

“This is quite an egregious misrepresentation of how we do predator management when we do have to do some of this,” said Dave Ealey, spokesman for Alberta Sustainable Resource Development, a bureau of the provincial government of Alberta. Yes, he acknowledged, the province does kill wolves, usually in response to attacks on livestock, and they do use “toxics.” They are also using aerial hunting to aid the caribou in the west-central area of the province, where other oil and gas developments (not the tar sands) have negatively affected the caribou.

Plug adapter: This is different from a power converter; it's only to make U.S. plugs fit into overseas outlets. I use the Kensington International Travel Plug Adapter ($19.99 at kensington.com), a tennis-ball-size unit with a fuse and retractable prongs that allow charging in 150 countries. (Tip: The vast majority of gadgets now are able to deal with overseas power; look on the power supply to make sure it says "Input 100-240V." If so, you shouldn't need a power converter. That said, not all power supplies are completely safe.)

Mrs. Devlin enjoyed playing golf and was an accomplished artist. She worked in both oils and watercolors and liked to paint landscapes and portraits.
But in concert, the songs took on a personal meaning. Springsteen, who often looks and acts indestructible — he spent much of the night treating the balconies and aisles of the Apollo as a jungle gym — is now 62 years old. Awareness of mortality hangs over his new songs. The resurrection he is singing about, and hoping for, has a deeply felt private dimension as well as a ringing public one.
It was one of the things I loved when I came here. But that had less to do with the design than the overall ingredients: open space and splashing water. The tall metal tubes that bleed water aren't exactly inspirational fountains, but abstractions of a fountain: gushing sprays, yawn. That's so traditional. Yes, that's why the Trevi Fountain in Rome is deserted every day. Boring.
An audit shows NJ Transit took a $297 million loss after Gov. Chris Christie scrapped the Hudson River rail tunnel project in 2010.
Makeup guru Bobbi Brown's cosmetics line was a pioneer of the "nude" look, where color is applied subtly to enhance features. Recently, the brand launched a collection called "Neons and Nudes"; the "Atomic Orange" lipstick ($23) sold out almost immediately. Even Ms. Brown had trouble finding the shade for her son's girlfriend. "It was a really big hit and a very big surprise to me," she says.
Another reason to go there on a regular basis was to pick up the latest "Sing Along Survey" from radio station KXOK, which provided a weekly ranking of the "Top 6 plus 30" popular songs. Better yet, the backs of the narrow paper sheets featured complete lyrics to a current hit. That knowledge came in handy, especially for songs in which the words were hard to understand.

But it's not yet clear whether the fund will help pay for foreclosure-counseling services, which are provided at little or no fee and to all comers by 14 Oregon organizations across the state.

I believe our higher educational institutions are failing at their mission and not being held accountable. If you visit a public university, one thing will become obvious: universities have a lot of money. There are new buildings, construction and fairly high-paid staff. The "promise land" is preached to every student. Hawking would be a better descriptive term.

Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is a 15-year-old girl from the Seam, a poor part of District 12, whose beloved father died in a mining explosion a few years before. Her mother, a healer, became lost in her grief, and Katniss had to step up to provide for the family, which also includes her gentle younger sister Prim (Willow Shields). Before he died, her father had taught her to hunt for game with a bow and arrow in the forests outside the district boundaries, and there she met Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), who also lost his father in the explosion and who became her hunting partner and best friend. Together they hunt and trade their bounty for other needed items in the Hob, or black market.
Explosive play-making.
I have a message for Georgians who are on the fence about a new stadium: It’s worth every penny. Economists will tell you stadiums never make sense and there’s no return on investment. Their thinking is that a stadium is a “community” asset and community value isn’t measured in money. If it were, every museum, theater, park and library would board up its windows.

Defensively, the Browns' noteworthy work was in stopping John Dottley, the freshman fullback near the top in league rushing figures. Dottley was stopped with 23 yards in six tries.

You expect children to act up. But I saw children knock over chairs, and bite and hit teachers. I was there when a boy came out of the bathroom with wet pants and said, proudly, that he had peed on himself.

Judith Gans at the University of Arizona puts it very well: Demographic trends have divided the world into two economic "camps."

Oh, there were plenty of unannounced guests under the East Rutherford sky on Sunday night. Few artists pass up an opportunity to entertain a sold-out stadium crowd at hip-hop’s biggest concert, hosted annually by New York-based Hot 97, its most important radio station. Busta Rhymes emerged from the New Meadowlands Stadium shadows to delight the 50,000 concertgoers with a minute of speed rap. Queens rap pioneers Mobb Deep enlivened Lloyd Banks’ grim-faced set with a rendition of the classic "Shook Ones."

"I really like balance," Albrecht said. "I've had a few teams where there's an exceptional player that can score in any game, any situation. But you almost have to be what I call a ‘five-tool' player in order to do that. You've got to have the 3-point (shooting), you have to have a one-on-one, you have to have a post-up game, you have to be able to run the court and you have to be able to offensive rebound. If you can do all of those things, you can probably score every night, but most guys don't have those tools."

These may seem like simple rules, but they have been developed through years of experience of dealing with the most difficult issue this region confronts -- race.

That said, what does this shift mean for the upcoming elections? Obviously the sentiments of Americans are changing, but the implications of those changes look to be incremental in influencing the electoral results. An earlier Pew poll found that 28% place gay marriage as “very important” to their vote, and 47% gave gun control the same weight. As has been said before, and will be said again before the polls close, it’s economy that trumps all matters, regardless of the changing tides toward gun-owning gay couples.

When the Blazers were preparing for the NBA draft, they contacted Diebler’s agent and gauged his openness at playing somewhere else, perhaps in Europe, for a season or two before he was given a chance to make the Blazers’ roster.

Since then I've had the pleasure of learning much about Nathan's convictions. Some are consistent with liberal politics; some are consistent with conservative politics. Some I agree with exactly; others I do not agree with at all. In each case, I found Nathan to be thoughtful and respectful. Does that suggest he is too compromising, as you have suggested? In the time I have known him, I have never seen him capitulate on his values. He respectfully disagrees and seeks a common understanding, a skill I wish more of our civic leaders possessed. Can he make the hard decisions necessary to govern? Those who have considered the totality of his honorable military service, his record in the state Assembly, and his personal capabilities have concluded that he is exactly the kind of clear, calm and decisive leader we need as mayor. He showed this decisiveness when he moved to independence. Did he damage his fellows by electing to become independent? By my estimation, the political parties exist to serve the voters and the candidates. I'm not sure when the notion that we serve them became relevant.

When the standard room rate is $795 a night, you rather hope that at least a few bucks are going to minimize carbon footprint. And at Four Seasons Resort Hualalai at Historic Kaupulehu, you'd be right, beginning with the news last fall that it has partnered with Hawaiian Legacy Hardwoods to plant 500,000 never-to-be-harvested native koa trees on the Hamakua Coast.

The old world falls away and in its place there is dust, blood and Ajla and Danijel staggering toward their newly divided worlds.

The past two months have been full of adjustments -- both on and off the field. Like any pitcher who comes to the United States from Asia, there are different nuances of the game. The baseball in the U.S. is larger and, some pitchers say, more slippery and difficult to grip. The dirt of the pitcher's mounds in Japan is softer in comparison to those here, which can cause more friction. There's also learning to communicate with new teammates, especially the catcher.

The cloud forests often are in an altitude "band" between 3,000 and 6,000 feet and cover the many valleys that cut away from the altiplano where Quito (altitude: 9,400 feet) sits and open up to the Pacific Coast plain to the west below.

It's not yet clear when Lance Berkman felt another pinch in his left calf muscle. It could have been when he tried to reach for a throw at first.

Even mild exercise can be painful for osteoarthritis patients. But with time, doctors say, the benefits accumulate as reduced pain and greater mobility. Strengthening the muscles around the knees or hip can help support the joints and take over some of the shock-absorbing functions played by cartilage, according to Harvard Medical School experts. Stronger muscles can also hold the joints in the most functional and least painful position. Regular activity can also replenish lubrication to the cartilage of the joint to reduce stiffness and pain. And aerobic activity such as swimming that doesn't put heavy stress on the hips, knees and spine can reduce inflammation in the joints, as well as improving overall fitness and weight control.

The answer resides in his range. Descalso possesses a plus arm and plus glove. However, third base is a reaction position while second base and shortstop are range positions. Questions about DD's range led TLR to expose him more at third base in Seotember 2010. David Freese's injury necessitated playing time there in 2011. Descalso is a very intelligent, heads-up player. I anticipate he'll pick up quickly on nuances such as positioning to help offset any range deficiencies. Of equal importance is whether he can consistently generate offense with greater exposure. After hitting .204 through May 21, the Gold Glove nominee at third base reached .270 on Sept.13 before settling at .264. However, Descalso managed only four RBI and six extra-base hits in his last 116 at-bats.

Anyway, that's more than enough reason to take a shot at the best movies made from TV shows. We're not including any movies inspired by "Saturday Night Live" skits ("The Blues Brothers" and "Wayne's World" being my faves.) Also, it's my opinion that the really good Batman movies, the Christian Bale editions, were not inspired at all by the TV incarnations of the comic books, but came directly from the graphic-novel (thick comic book) work of Frank Miller and his "Dark Knight."
