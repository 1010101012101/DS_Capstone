"The contamination is evidently more extensive and mobile than originally believed and conditions in the subsurface may be changing in response to seasonal influences," Avramenko said in the order served Thursday, "all of which may have caused the contamination to express itself in the form of one or more seeps discharging into Sand Creek and vapors intruding into buildings overlying the plume."

"I have hugely diverse influences," says Urban, who topped the country charts earlier this year with "Without You," an acoustic ballad about his devotion to his family (he is married to actress Nicole Kidman, and they have two children together). "When I was starting out, I just wanted to play like the guy in the band up the street. I grew up in a time when there wasn’t any Google. I’d listen to the radio and hear something I liked, and I wouldn’t even know who was playing it. But I would learn it anyway."
Two conservative Arizona GOP congressmen countered that worries that the middle class is losing its pull with Congress are overblown.
The Chinese government took a beating leading up to Beijing for its restrictive policies, and curious behavior. We've been critical of China for the careful orchestration of the opening ceremony, and for acting paranoid, and for being politically heavy-handed and controlling. But it's probably worth pointing out that North Korea makes China look easygoing.

Probably without realizing it, most Americans had accepted the fundamental promises of contemporary economics. These were: First, we know enough to prevent another Great Depression; second, although we can't prevent every recession, we know enough to ensure sustained and, for the most part, strong recoveries. These propositions, endorsed by most economists, had worked themselves into society's belief structure.

But I'll also remember that McMillan leaves the franchise a mess. It's no better off than when he inherited it. The team was playing at the end as though it really did want him fired. And while you could make a compelling case for McMillan to stick as the coach, there comes a time when you must recognize that a person has done all he can do.
"The Cobalt has been a price leader ever since day one," Peterson said. He added that as Honda made the Civic larger to attract customers, Ford added features such as its Sync voice-activated media system to the Focus, and Toyota burnished its reputation for quality with the Corolla, GM continually cut prices on the Cobalt to keep it in the market.
Hurricanes coach Al Golden said Forston is looking at a three-month recovery period.
In the wave of firings and resignations that followed, the House passed the Student Loan Sunshine Act. The Act requires all schools that work with student loan companies to adopt a code of conduct banning them from accepting any gifts or giving preferential treatment to loan companies with which their officers are affiliated.

St. John’s rallied from a 3-0 deficit in the third with the help of two throwing errors by Brandt. He first threw wildly to second on a comebacker, trying to start a double play, and then made a wild pickoff throw, allowing Matt Wessinger to take third. He scored on Jimmy Brennan’s single, and Jeremy Baltz was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded later in the inning.

The word mole comes from the Nahuatl word for sauce, but it describes a number of sauces and dishes used in Mexican cooking. The best known of these, mole poblano, is named for its origin in Puebla.

An art jury made up of city officials and Art Association members made the selections. The one by Hinkle contained a misspelling in the name of the Gudauskas surfing family, but the jury liked the artwork so much that the city selected it, leaving it to the artist to use the correct spelling on the utility box.
I'm tired of Orioles shoving the glory years of the 1970s, '80s early'90s and the 20th anniversary of what amounts to a museum down my throat. I'd like for my two girls to experience winning seasons and perpetual playoff appearances as I did at their age. But no, the Orioles are in another "rebuilding year" (is it 15 years now, I've lost track?), which is their constant state of being. It's mediocrity at its worst.

A Coast Guard boat raced to the scene, and sailors plucked him out of the water. The drill is the same every time, no matter what. Medics perform CPR until they return to the dock. There, usually, the jumper is declared dead. The body is covered and guarded until the coroner arrives.
But Brian Sozzi, a Wall Street Strategies analyst, says shoppers' discontent -- much like the Missoni for Target line -- is fleeting. "I think it is short-term anger," he said.

With Frank Gore and Marshawn Lynch at the forefront the 49ers travel north to play Seattle on Saturday in an NFC West matchup thick with playoff implications for both sides. San Francisco is postseason bound for the first time since 2002, having locked up the division weeks ago.

"I can also see that it was caught yesterday in Area A7," he said, because Louisiana tracks its seafood "all the way from the water to your plate," through "trip tickets."
"We played a great first period. We got frustrated halfway through the second when we weren't having success. We left the page, and came right back in the third period. Right back into the buy-in. It wasn't a big speech. It was just a common-sense discussion at the end of the second period with the players. ‘This is who we are, this is how we play.' The buy-in went right back in again, and away we went."

One of those gateways is Eagle Marsh, where the Wabash River flows near the Maumee River in the Fort Wayne, Ind., area. In flood conditions, it is conceivable carp from the Wabash River could swim through Eagle Marsh and into the Maumee River.

Four short years later, the Pistons are headed for the NBA lottery for the third consecutive year, and the Red Wings are on the brink of losing in the first round of the playoffs, failing to make it past the second round for the third straight year. Unacceptable by most standards and certainly unacceptable by the standards here in Detroit.
NEW YORK -- Mayor Michael Bloomberg helped light the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree Wednesday night, ushering in the tourist season for one of the city's busiest holiday shopping districts. Retailers want this year to be just as busy as ever, despite the downturn.

Clyde Daniels, an outstanding player in the area for decades and a member of Champ's support group, explains lag: "(Cameron) has the ability to keep the shaft of the club close to his right arm for an extended period of time on the downswing.

And I don't think Adams can send Miller out to answer the tough questions.
The GOP-run Senate already had agreed to let people with concealed-handgun permits carry weapons in bars and other businesses that hold Ohio liquor permits. A nuttier idea is impossible to imagine. But too many Statehouse officeholders, including lame-duck Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, are indebted to, or afraid of, Ohio's relentless gun lobby. (Strickland said he'd sign the guns-in-bars bill if it reached his desk.) However, a House committee hasn't acted either way, meaning the measure would die Dec. 31.

The overarching emphasis, he said, will be to focus on results that get children ready to learn in kindergarten and to read by first grade. Other states, including Washington, are far ahead in coordinating and measuring programs. Curtis said she expects few changes to Head Start. But she said the state's $60 million in yearly child-care subsidies for low-income working parents is ripe for change, as there are no minimum education standards for the care those children receive.
In the last mile of Monday's Boston Marathon, however, Kenya's Salina Kosgei outkicked Goucher and defending champion Dire Tune, going back and forth with Tune in the final blocks of Boylston Street to win the closest women's finish in event history.

Personal story: "Recently, a young woman at my school ... lost her sister in September due to a horrific car accident. Beth was and is everyone's friend, but she was very dear to my cousin, Sarah. In Beth and Sarah's junior year and my senior year, (Beth's) family and their friends, Incarnate, and I watched Beth and her family undergo the pain that came along with young Katie's death. Her death inspired me to really care for the ones I love and enver let each day pass without happiness. Beth and her family are truly the strongest individuals I have ever met, and the obstacle of overcoming this loss in their family an in the Incarnate community was accompanied by pain and togetherness. This event has taught me to appreciate every moment I share with the ones I love."

People on low-sodium diets may want to avoid kimchi, but the rest of us can make it a staple and reap the benefits. Vitamin rich and low in calories, it has sustained Korean health for centuries and now crossed the ocean to establish itself here.

The Vita’s predecessor, the PlayStation Portable, is indeed the go-to choice for many a hardcore gamer’s travel companion. However, at first glance, the Vita offers only a logical evolution from the PSP, especially in the area of design, as you can see in this visual comparison. The updated control layout and larger screen point to a device edging closer to replicating the experience of being at home on say, your PlayStation 3 console. In fact, the Vita does exactly that, allowing a user to pause his or her PS3 game at home and resume it on the Vita.

The most common alternative to legislative cars, reimbursing lawmakers at the Internal Revenue Service's standard business rate of 50 cents per mile, would likely be more expensive, Barankin said.

Mr. Cameron will have to tackle those woes without the big parliamentary majority he was long expected to have, but squandered in the final months of a historic, topsy-turvy campaign.

Brown backs Obama's suggestion that an infrastructure bank be created to pay for public works projects, and believes there's enough bipartisan support for such a measure to pass. Brown himself has introduced legislation to create an infrastructure bank that would be financed through a combination of federal loans and private equity. Brown cites Federal Highway Administration data that indicates every $1 billion spent on highway construction creates nearly 35,000 jobs. The infrastructure bank idea is been endorsed by both the AFL-CIO union and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Given the Blazers' bad luck with knees lately, given that Camby would be expected to play right away, given that seeing is believing, if the center doesn't play against the Lakers on the eve of the trade deadline, an opportunity is lost.

Francois Truffaut's "The Soft Skin," a rare flop for the director when it was released in 1964, features Francoise Dorleac, Catherine Deneuve's sister, well on her way to stardom when she died in a car crash at age 25. Modern-day reviews have been kinder. The New Yorker calls the flick "one of Truffaut's best . . . a masterwork of erotic frenzy." Maybe in 47 years, critics will say the same about "Gigli."

McCoy always had a complicated relationship with the architectural and cultural establishment, which was based in those days almost exclusively on the East Coast. She was rejected by the Guggenheim Foundation when she was trying to get the research for "Five California Architects" off the ground in 1953.

Ferry Street fixture a suave, stylish gathering place. Portions are huge, and in the Ironbound, that’s saying something. Shrimp in garlic sauce not as good, or garlicky, as Casa Vasca’s version. Mussels in tomato sauce highly recommended. Roasted lamb shank — three mammoth hunks of meat in peppery, tomatoey sauce — is excellent. So is the filet mignon, menacing and meaty. Blackened salmon: sensational. Skip the squid in ink sauce.

American Glamour and the Evolution of Modern Architecture, by Alice T. Friedman (Yale University Press; 262 pages; $65). If your architectural ideal is a Victorian home, midcentury modernism can seem boring and flat.

Left unsaid was that the only hope Christie had for getting Hanson’s recommendations enacted was to keep casino gambling in Atlantic City alone.

Star-Ledger film critic Stephen Whitty particularly praised Scorsese's deft handling of 3D: "He uses it the way few filmmakers have.

Sloth is a capitol sin in Columbus, given the laziest General Assembly in living memory. Latest example: The failure of the Senate, led by Republicans, and the House, led by Democrats, to craft a reform of how Ohio draws legislative districts. Wednesday came and went -- the deadline for placing such a reform on November's ballot so Ohioans could vote it up or down. Ohio legislators, last seen in Columbus June 4, did nothing.

Being on Cull's cart with a pirate flag (also known as lightning rod) on the back, we had to be the last ones in as we checked to see if Cull might have hit a hole in one. He missed it by just a couple of feet and fortunately the lightning struck a little further from us than that.
Going on a trip brings us close to the landscapes of other places-and the spiritual landscapes of our soul. The key, I think, is admitting to ourselves that these are sacred times. We shouldn't over plan these days. There should be room for holy surprises to emerge. There should be moments of stillness balanced with times of renewing movement. Somehow, the silly and the sacred are combined.

We were surprised to see kohada ($4.75), or Japanese shad, on the menu. When we asked what it was, the sushi chef pointed to a picture and described the fish as mild. It was, but a quick dip in a light pickling sauce and a smear of ginger punches up the nigiri tremendously without disguising the flavor of the thin, white-fleshed fish.
My opinion of the show rose even higher when it showed the engines of a 707 revving up for a run down the runway – the black tubes coming out of the back of the engines cast them as turbojets, the predecessor of the turbofans of today. A little bit of detail for the aviation buff. I tolerate the clunky melodrama just to look at the CGI shots of the 707 flying across the sky or see the stewardesses in their powder-blue uniforms and the flight captains in their white hats.

Through two innings of work, Westbrook had gotten one groundball, had two chats with catcher Yadier Molina, and walked four batters. This was not the idea ratio of grounders to meetings to walks that the righty was looking for in his first start of the regular season. Westbrook had to work with a tight strike zone, but he also pitched into the problem by hanging out just outside the edges of the zone. But after the walks, Westbrook found outs.

As we gear up for a presidential election that is sure to be especially costly due to the Supreme Court's decision freeing up corporate spending, Democrats are in more need than ever of financial support. The only argument the Democrats seem to have for the LGBT community appears to be, "We are all you have; the other guys are so much worse."

The leads are a delight. Cardia has a gorgeous voice and Schmittou, a Stages favorite, is pure charm. The script, by Blake Edwards, sails through jokes that work even if the material is a touch dated; for all its talk of equality, it's basically a comedy of confusion, something that Edwards and director Michael Hamilton are right at home with.

If he isn’t, the Nationals could go with four pitchers in their rotation for a bit because of two upcoming off days. ... Houston OF Jason Bourgeois (right quadriceps strain) went 0 for 5 in a rehabilitation start at Double-A Corpus Christi on Sunday. He will join Triple-A Oklahoma City on Tuesday. ...

Manning warmed up by testing Bailey early. Bailey was playing despite a right heel injury that had him hobbling away from Invesco Field on crutches just seven days earlier.
“Defensive medicine” provides a convenient distraction from the real issues that plague our health care system. The vast majority of research has uncovered little evidence that it is prevalent. The federal Government Accountability Office has questioned the occurrence of defensive medicine, saying costs have not been reliably measured. Existing surveys often rely on narrow surveys of doctors with biased wording and low response rates to bolster their claims.

Many people initially balk at the idea of setting aside meat and cheese. But Southern classics actually translate very well into hearty, delicious vegan dishes. I hope Deen will consider canceling the diabetes drug deal and instead encourage Americans to substantially change their diets -- filling up on more black-eyed peas and collard greens and steering clear of fried chicken -- to fight this deadly disease.

Texas A&M is unhappy with its position in the Big 12 since intra-state rival Texas started its own television network, the Longhorn Network, in concert with ESPN.
3. Sophomore Deshaun Thomas allowed his emotions to run away with him. He made at least one lazy reach-in foul, and really was guilty of all four for which he was called. After playing superbly for four tournament games, Thomas let the fouls and some good shots that didn't go down get to him. He spent timeouts stewing and fussing, pacing alone outside the huddle when he was on the bench. He's not ready for the NBA.

In 1985 when he experimented with mechanical harvesters that relied on sticks instead of vibrating hoops, Barrett says, "it was just ugly, really tore up the vines." This year, Barrett harvested one Merlot vineyard with a machine calibrated to his specifications. "It really shook up the vines but didn't seem to hurt them," he says. "We'll know more about the effect on the vines when we prune in the spring. But the fruit looked gorgeous, primarily whole berries and much less juice than we expected. We could still sort the fruit." After blind tasting the different lots of Merlot in January, he says, he'll have a better idea of the effect on quality.
More tricks of this age aficionado: a farmhouse-style sink in the kitchen, burlap-style shades from Blue Seeds boutique above the banquette, and custom cabinets from Chadwick Fine Furniture - also crafted to look old. (Hubbard actually knocked on the door of her old 1950s home in Phoenix and asked-begged the owners to let her photograph a cabinet she adored. Chadwick craftsmen replicated it, down to the beadwork trim.)
“Because the Night.” When Springsteen has performed this song in concert, over the years, he has used his original lyrics (in 1977, he sent his demo to Smith, who added some lyrics). In this version, he sings Smith’s words, too, and makes them sound so personal they seem like his own.
Before "Uncle!" comes Lozada-Hissom's unmissable desserts. They include gelatos and an elegant olive oil-citrus cake, but if you skip the Chocolate Crunch Bar — a thin chocolate dacquoise, a layer of ganache, a layer of crunchy chocolate praline, hazelnuts, gelato, and more— well, then you've skipped Denver's dessert of the moment. For shame, because it is a marvel.

And in recent years, the problem had only grown more exacerbated. In his last three seasons, Ethier hit a combined .215 against left-handers. It was enough of a lineup quandary that in the offseason Manager Don Mattingly said he might use Ethier and James Loney in a quasi-platoon this season. And that Ethier's emotions wasted 100 at-bats last year.
He also admitted that he under-reported his income to the government for years: $5,304 in 2003; $9,879 in 2004; $45,219 in 2005; $64,743 in 2006; $64,514 in 2007.

Sherpa says: Classic St. Louis-style ribs: meaty bones with a smoky grilled flavor from an old-fashioned cooking pit and slathered in a rich, thick sauce. While close to fall-off-the-bone tender, there was a bit of tooth pull required - which I prefer. The sauce is a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but it all brought back good backyard memories.

Despite a change in coaches, she says she’s making the right adjustments.
I've watched the Cubs for 40 years, but it is all I can take watching Soriano "try" to play defense. Combine that with his propensity to chase 0-2 sliders a foot off the plate, and I gotta wonder how Quade can keep trotting that out there. I understand the contract probably dictates he plays, but what a message it would send to just cut him loose. Greg Paris, Albia, Iowa
Keary McCarthy, chief of staff to Democratic House Leader Armond Budish, said the group, called Fair Elections Ohio, would take the referendum off the ballot if Republicans restored in-person absentee voting the weekend before election day.
In recent weeks, an Afghan soldier opened fire on a group of American soldiers but missed the group entirely. The Americans quickly shot him to death.

The eldest of those 77 million Americans born between 1946 and 1964 became eligible for Social Security four years ago.

First, make sure you earn preference points every year for every species (even if you're not planning to hunt them), until you have enough preference points to draw your dream tag. That doesn't mean stop hunting. Instead, apply for a preference point on your first choice and put in for a second- or third-choice tag that you are pretty sure you'll draw. The strategy will demand some research to find less popular hunting areas that you can draw on a second choice, but it can be done. By selecting "leftover draw" instead of "refund" on deer and elk applications, hunters get first chance at leftover deer and elk licenses before they go on sale to the general public on August 14.

The aptly named Misanik Rules team had four members, sisters of the same last name -- Emily, Christen, Rachel and Jacquelyn -- from North Canton.
"Go big or go home," was my son's mentality when deciding to pick the toughest Officer Candidate School in the military. When he graduates this summer, he'll come back to Missouri, finish his architecture degree, and then head off to unknown places, a commissioned Marine officer whose future will be determined by politicians not yet elected, by world events yet to unfold, defending a nation that seems to have lost the ability to talk to itself.

That said, the violence — in which more Afghans than Americans have been killed — is an ominous reminder of the fragility of the relationship between the United States and its allies on the one hand, and an Afghan populace wearied by a decade of Western occupation on the other. Especially shocking was the execution-style murder of two U.S. service members assigned to the supposedly secure precincts of the Interior Ministry. The gunman, who is still at large, is suspected of being an Afghan police intelligence officer. Afterward, U.S. commanders withdrew Western military advisors from various Afghan ministries as a precaution. The symbolism was stark: Americans couldn't trust their Afghan allies.
First, the court could allow the state’s cuts, handing a victory to Christie. Second, the court could grant the state a "time out," meaning a temporary reprieve from fully funding schools during the economic crisis. The third option would force the state to fully fund the formula. The court may even require it to pay schools the $820 million already cut, which would be devastating to Christie, who has tried to pare state spending and avoid tax increases.
Gary Klein, Rina's husband of nearly eight years, did not hear the whispers. He sobbed and begged God to take him and spare the mother of his three young boys. His sister said she dismissed the dark allusions as symptoms of shock and grief.

“Our goal is to raise funds for research to help find cures to major illnesses, in particular those affecting children. 75% of an individual’s health after age 40 is dependent on lifestyle and not genetic predisposition to major illnesses. In these difficult economic times, it is even more important to make health a priority. Stress and rising health care costs have had a major effect on all of us”, comments Dr. Schlobohm. “Clinical research shows that the majority of chronic illnesses in the United States, such as heart disease, some cancers, diabetes, obesity, back pain, neck pain and headaches can be avoided by preventative health care. We are leaders in prevention.”

"If you are going to be successful for sure in football with the way it's set up, even more so now with the new salary cap structure, you got to have contributions from young players and really from rookies also," Harbaugh said. "You are focused on the task at hand, but I'm always excited about the future of our football team. I think we do a great job drafting and acquiring free agents. We do a great job of developing players. Our coaches do a great job of that. And we do a great job in the weight room with guys. I'm excited about the long-term of the Ravens, no doubt. But I'm more excited about Sunday."
The two homages to fallen colleagues came as part of a 24-song set that drew the largest audience of the sold-out, three-day Coachella festival, which returns Friday for a second weekend featuring the same 140-act lineup that performed this weekend.

But the 60 percent of small businesses that have been around more than five years act as a slight drag on the number of jobs available in the United States. They have cut about 0.5 percent more staff than they have added in a typical year, according to Haltiwanger.
Kevin Pelton: When a player and team part ways, we often hear it compared to a divorce. In the case of Jamal Crawford and the Blazers, I think this is more like an annulment. Both sides had the best of intentions in December, but it just never worked. Crawford isn't a point guard, which Portland needed him to be for the rotation to work, and he's not really the kind of veteran leader the Blazers needed in the locker room when things came apart. So assuming Crawford opts out, he's likely to find a better fit while Portland goes in a superior direction by promoting Elliot Williams to backup two.
