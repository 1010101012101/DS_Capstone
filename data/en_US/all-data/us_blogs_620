We were traveling down Highway 99 towards a town called Lockford. Lockford is the very definition of a small town. Their main street may be all of 3 or 4 blocks long. Why would we visit a town that has one grocery store, one meat market and a few restaurants? Friends, very good friends! These wonderful people have also cheered us through good times and our bad times. They are treasured.

It was designed and built by Sir W.G. Armstrong & Co who began construction in 1876 and finished 2 years later in 1878. The bridge provided a high level roadway over the Ouseburn river and Jesmond Dene connecting the suburbs of Heaton and Jesmond. It was pedestrianised in either 1960 or 1963 and substantially repaired in 1983 not long after it had won a reprieve from demolition.

Lovelies, it's Friday on the East Coast and so I am doing this post right now (even though it's only around 10pm here on the West Coast). S2 is 6 years old today- July 22 on the east coast. ;) *sigh* My first little girl is now my big girl who will always be my little girl. Time has flown by so fast. I can't believe how grown she is, how beautiful she is, how smart she is and how much she loves (almost!) everyone she encounters. S2 is such a great big sister and a fun little sister, although I know S1 haaaaaates when she is in his room. She is his first sibling and they share a special bond even though they are 8 years apart.

The first round was over 70% in-game shots. So I’m going to presume the comment was made based on the rounds where contestants were required to have a specific item in their outfit and thus it was harder for people to have everything they wanted/needed.

One-half of the KC Beer Blog team made it to the party, and a couple of brewing friends that I haven't seen in a while were there, too. There was a lot going on, so I may have missed something.

Over the course of ten years new magazines appeared that had different readers in mind and looked quite unlike anything that had preceded then. They re-vamped vogue and the new-look Queen we’re still catering for an older, middle class market but Honey, which first first appeared in 1960, was not merely a showcase for fashion. Honey ran articles on leaving home, flat-sharing, sex and the contraceptive pill, and careers. Honey also lent its name to a series of out-of-London shops so that their readers could find the clothes they wanted.

I read the books and I found it brilliant. I love the idea and the characters are very well done. Seth Grahme-Smith did a great job portraying the complexity of Abraham Lincoln. The story may be ridiculous but the character development is quite fascinating. Plus, it is an action packed book that is also a lot of fun. If they play it right this movie can also be a lot of fun. From what has been shown so far, this looks like quite a ride.

I went inside and googled zucchini plants because I wanted to see how long it took to grow the vegetables. I learned that there are male and female zucchini blossoms – the male ones are on a thin stem and do not produce any food and the female ones are at the end of the actual zucchini (like in the picture above). Then I found out that the flowers are edible and that there were all these rave reviews about how tasty they were when battered and fried. So I got the grand idea to make me some.
Pas de parents: Parents are not expected to stay, nor are you invited to. You arrive at the designated hour -- invariably at the child's home -- and drop off your little one. This is true whether you "know" the parents or not. You might exchange brief pleasantries with the parents whose names you may (or more likely may not) know. "La maman de Cole" or Luc or Pierre, usually suffices. (More on that later)

When Prof. Sinclair returned from America, the police had already found Luis and his friend, Enrique. Luis had refused to talk about what had happened to Pete Byrd at all, but Enrique, being a more practical man, had shown the police the hole, but refused to go near it, pointing from a distance. Since Tikal was a UNESCO Cultural Heritage of Humanity Site, the police had stayed out of the acropolis entrance, but insisted on sending an officer down to accompany Prof. Sinclair. Once in the hole, they found that only two rooms were connected. Another wall was completely obscured by ages of dirt, which the professor assumed led in the direction of more acropolis. The first room was simply stone, with two jaguar heads carved in relief on either wall. A low doorway led to the second room, which was simply small and cramped. On the ground was the flashlight, batteries dead, but in the "off" position, and the video camera. The dirt on the ground was disturbed, apparently from Pete walking around in the room, but there was no other sign of him, and only the one exit.
Next time I make it I’m going to try to get a lemon cheesecake flavor so I’m going to do less vanilla and more lemon juice. The original recipe had twice as much agave so if you like it extra sweet try that. You can also smash strawberries on top instead of raspberries (which I’ve also tried and is very yummy). You can add a little cocoa powder in to give a chocolate taste. It’s a very adaptable recipe!

I enjoyed doing a tour of the area looking at their well-placed and informative historical signage. Because it covered a fair distance it became a driving tour, and the rain was driving as well.

Generally speaking, my family and friends have grown to appreciate (or at the very least, accept) my tattoos. Every time I get a new tattoo, my parents still ask "this will be the last one, right?" even though by now, they already know the answer. My mom actually got her first tattoo on her 60th birthday, so I like to think I converted even her.

Cynthia has a new endeavor aimed at helping inspire us, too. She recently launched a virtual magazine called "Studio Mojo." You can read more about it at PCD if you are interested. It requires a paid subscription, and I signed up last week and spent a lovely afternoon via the web with Cynthia and polymer artist Lindly Haunani (from whom I learned a lesson in patience) and also reading through the back issues. It is like being able to attend a master class every day. I am really excited about the concept and the chance to see and hear the interviews in real time, so bravo to you, Cynthia. Much good luck with the new website, and thank you again for the feature.
Some of you already know that I am fairly new to running. I have been fitted with an Asic Kayano Gel 17 at a specialist running store here in Canberra. They were great, served the purpose of protecting my fraile joints and muscle while my body adapts to running. As I got ‘infected’ by the running bug, I began to read more about running and came across the book that probably sits on every runner’s bookshelf: Born to Run. I won’t run you through the book (maybe will write a review next time), but the book basically made me look closer at the way I run. And I realized that, while I am not much a heel striker (a way of running that has increasingly been linked to common running injuries), I don’t have an efficient stride. I pound hard on the pavement and am noisy on the treadmill. I decided that the problem may lie in the shoe being a) too cushiony, b) too heavy and the raised heel of the shoe.
Finally, I was asked, “for tabulation,” my age, education level, general political orientation, homeowner or renter, race, religion, and household income.
I used dark blue vinyl to finish the sign. I could have used black but I thought this color would give it a little better look then just black and white. I also based my design off of a personalized eye chart I found on Red Envelope. I took that concept and related it to our family. I finished the chart by describing personal highlights of each member of the family. I loved how it turned out! And really love how my project cost less then $7 which is considerably cheaper then the eye chart on Red Envelope's website and it is created based solely on my family's "story".

Yes, slave labour, stimulated by the threat of being burned with a hot iron or thrown out a 19th floor window, or merely by the promise from a snakehead people-trafficker of a salary marginally above the starvation levels of poverty you have left your family to wallow in at home (c.f.

He opens his eyes. What appears to his gaze is something he seems to have seen already, every day: streets full of people, hurrying, elbowing their way ahead, without looking one another in the face, among high walls, sharp and peeling. In the background, the starry sky scatters intermittent flashes like a stalled mechanism, which jerks and creaks in all its unoiled joints, outposts of an endangered universe, twisted, restless as he is.

(Boater39) “In our apartment complex, we had a fire last week at our sprinkler pump. Afterwards, I went to investigate and it was the electric meter that burned up. Took out decent-sized FP&L feeder in the process. I have an electrical background, and from my professional experience, whatever caused the meter to burn up was a dead short carrying a very large amount of current. Based on the damage, the problem was AT THE METER–not at the customer equipment attached to the meter. (like I said, I have professional experience). At the time I found it strange, until I saw this report on TV…. I will be sending some pictures to Patrick today–they can use them on whatever followup they want. It appears that we have a major design flaw with these new meters!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

My husband and I started Dave Ramsey's Financial Peace University last April. Our motivation was that we had bought our house the year before, recieved the stimulus for it and put it aside to "help get us through the transition". Well, by December we had blown through those thousands and had overdrawn our account, not by much, but still not good. We knew something had to change, but how. We had done "budgets" for years (I even still have them on my computer as a reminder), and we'd busted plenty of them. We had never made any real progress towards savings, college, or retirement and it was frustrating. We had a toddler and a 6 month old, so we were busy and broke, but my husband's sister had told us about Dave Ramsey because they had done it. She was notoriously "free-spirited" and hated trying to manage money, so when I heard how well it was working for them I thought, "Okay, I guess it's worth a shot".

In addition to the above-mentioned individuals, thousands of other criminals and potential terrorists are allowed to reside inside Norway’s borders and more are arriving every day.

So based on the concept above – what then would be a better way to lose body fat … the opposite, so instead of a long steady cardio -you do burst training . This could be in the form of Tabata training or High Intensity Interval training which would be discussed in my Sid’s Special column or what ever types of exercises that elevate your hear rate quickly.
Still, there are some lovely moments in the film simply due to the high profile reputations of the three musicians. Watching The Edge and Jack White both grin from ear to ear as Jimmy Page stands four feet in front of them and starts cranking out Whole Lotta Love for their personal edification, you have to grin from ear to ear yourself. Plus there is some very cool archival footage, heartfelt introspection and some wistful nostalgia that seems deserved. The film definitely has a heart. What it's lacking is real guts, that place deep down where the music comes from.

In my training class, I became friends with two guys-- Neil and Brent. We're all close in age, and doing nursing later in life-- Neil and Brent are in their late forties (I'm 50). I always enjoy running into Neil. He's smart and sardonically funny. As we've gotten to be friends, he's opened up about his life a little more. He comes from a tight Irish family. He's been with the same guy for some time now; they're trying to decide whether or not to move in together. He worked as a nurse for a couple of years before this job, so he's also someone I ask for advice at times.

Doyle has a great eye for everything that his happening around him. When he goes to Japan for the World Cup 2002 (held jointly in South Korea and Japan) he describes the dour- faced Japanese policemen who have been told to expect soccer hooligans from England, instead, they are confronted hoardes of Irish fans, dressed as leprechauns and priests and are cheerily greeting the policemen who don't know what to make of the spectacle unfolding before their very eyes. Japanese fans, in contrast, are fairly subdued, what's more, soccer seems to be the sport of the young and the very young. The older Japanese folk do not follow soccer and were actually up in arms with the government for hosting the World Cup. Many were just plain scared of the foreigners arriving into their cities in large numbers and went out of their way to avoid them.

Let’s get straight here. Here is the fractal. The sole purpose institutions is to get bigger and to accrue more financial resources in its direct control. The sole purpose of its subsidiary departments and divisions is to do the same. To imagine any other purpose is to be recklessly naive. Institutions do not exist to serve any external purpose. They exist to look after their own interests. The same is true for their parts.
For me, I saw something change in Jesse. It was this “click” where you could see him buckle down, dig deeper for that little “something” that helped to push him a little further, pitch a little harder or focus his placement. It was as if you could just see the change. It was amazing to watch.

I was definitely being prepared for what was to come. My scripture study and also my other "fun" reading were all about how we will go through hard times and it is our choice as to how we handle it and the attitude we have. Also, this is part of something Joseph Fielding Smith said "He (God) knew not only what each of us could do, but also what each of us would do when put to the test and when responsibility was given us." I just knew that something was coming and I was going to have to show that I WOULD do it. I hope that the way I handle the "up" and the "down" will be my way of showing I CAN!!

Each of these actors seemed to lose themselves within their characters, each working towards a benevolent whole. Whedon created a cohesive universe and allowed his audience to take a peek.

It was like witnessing a television special with a $200 million budget. Never before has anything like these even been attempted…unless it has, but I can’t remember it so it doesn’t count. Sorry imaginary film franchise. Whedon beat you. Take it like a man…or concept. Either one.

To disagree with Catholic bishops is called “disrespectful,” an offense against religious freedom. That is why there is a kind of taboo against bringing up Romney’s Mormonism. But if Romney sincerely believed in polygamy on religious grounds, as his grandfather did, he would not even be considered for the presidency—any more than a sincere Christian Scientist, who rejects the use of medicine, would be voted for to handle public health care. Yet a man who believes that contraception is evil is an aberrant from the American norm, like the polygamist or the faith healer.Good reading, and an impressive 212 comments, also worth your time.

Since returning to the heart of our defence he’s been an absolute beast. I’m a big fan of centre halves with a touch of finesse, a la Franco Baresi, but I also believe that in English football you need at least one of your central defenders to be a big, scary b*****d, and Huth is just that – a monster who knows how to close the space and find his man but is also strong and intimidating. Not everything he does is legal, but often, like Judge Dredd, he is the law, as numerous Premier League strikers (and Matthew Upson) have discovered to their cost. It was no wonder that Chris Herd had to go off after heading Huth’s chin – it must have been akin to headbutting Thor’s hammer.

In the past few years we have gained some new furniture from my grandmother, but it's not the presence of furniture I noted- it's all the clutter. True, there is an inordinate amount of colored plastic baby toys in the old images, but there was also space. Something there is little of now. Both girls looked at old pictures of their rooms and said that they wanted their rooms now to look like that (hallelujah!). They are both pack rats and save every little thing. I'd love to clear out a great majority of the "stuff" in their rooms. Same goes for me and the closets and the insides of cabinets and all my bow stuff needs a massive reorganization.

Most of the Norwegian micro brews seems to have gone dark this Christmas. Understandably for the Julefnugg- literally Christmas (snow) flake- brewed by the Berentsens brewhouse in Egersund, the dark mainland of Norway ( a term used to describe the Bible Belt in Norway, probably stemming from the many missionaries leaving the area, bound for Livingstone's dark continent). Long journeys were incidentally the background also for the beer styles emerging this Christmas from the Norwegian microbreweries, the Imperial Stout or the Baltic Porter.

However, there is a psychological theory called “Terror Management Theory” (TMT) that shows that when people are made aware of their own mortality, they become more punitive and aggressive towards others who could potentially threaten their world view and self-esteem. For example, judges are more likely to hand down harsher sentences if they have been reminded of their impending deaths.

"My friend was working with CBS doing promotion work and it was his role to promote Johnny Nash’s single. We were all out in a club called the Bag of Nails in Soho when I ended up meeting both Johnny Nash and Bob Marley. During that conversation they were bemoaning the fact they couldn’t get their single in the top 40 as they could not get any national radio airplay. I suggested as a bit of a promotion they should come down and play to the kids at our school, and a few days later they came down and played two 45 minute sets." The musical partnership between Johnny Nash and Bob Marley is one of the more fascinating and overlooked in the history of reggae music. Though by no means an artistic innovator on par with reggae contemporaries like Marley, Prince Buster, Desmond Dekker or Jimmy Cliff, Nash was a musical pioneer and proved a pivotal force behind the mainstream acceptance of reggae music and in promoting Marley and The Wailers.

Doublemint and Double Bubble gum (did you know you could still find those?), two-packs of Walker shortbread cookies (a tie in with their last name)... and she asked me to bake the cake. She asked for twins, surfer, beachy, and bright colors (not too girly-girl). I figured surfboards, palm trees, sand and sea would do the trick.

There was one university teacher who, while she didn’t inspire in me a love of history per se, talked about the past in such a way that she made it vital and thrilling. Madame Thysse was a Frenchwoman close to retirement who taught us explication de texte. Once a week, using the rigorous, formal method she drummed into us, we dissected a page of literary French in a positively forensic manner. She had her favourite French stylists and her enthusiasm was infectious.

Near the end of 2011 I play a character called Victor in a project called ‘Destiny’.

The unstated but depressing reason I find this funny, however, is that it actually deviates from one of the key elements of Christian theology: the fall. See, the notion is that before Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge, everything was awesome. Afterwards, however, they were cast out of paradise and things generally went to shit. Moreover, a large number of Christian denominations have basically taken the stance that the world is gradually getting worse, and will continue to do so until Jesus returns. There's great in-character discussion of this in Umberto Eco's The Name of the Rose, but for a modern example just hang out on Conservapedia for a while.** So, in short, this is both funny and sad to me because the very notion that god would resolve the problem of evil by explaining that things are actually getting better is, itself, fantastically heretical.

My husband, Christian, delivered a wonderful eulogy and talked about my Dad’s life and legacy. He did a wonderful job but there is no way to sum up the life of a person in such few words. Each person sits at the funeral and thinks about their life with the person deceased and they process the whole life of the person. Nothing he said would have brought closure like the flag ceremony did.

“Should a motorist fail to observe a granny wobbling to avoid a pothole or a rain drain, then he is guilty of failing to anticipate that this was somebody on her maiden voyage into the abyss.

But it’s clearly not the primary explanation for who suffers and whose dreams are broken on the rack. The obvious primary explanation is that some people’s lives are destroyed and curtailed and kept in a cage by social rules, in order to maintain and gratify the power of others. The sick, that is, are not sick – they are injured, and injured by those who Nietzshe calls ‘the strong’, “the successful and victorious”.

Rather in the manner of a philosophical treatise, this novel has a foreword, and Mann occupies it by playing with the theme of time. He beseeches his reader to consider the story old, although the setting is quite recent. He takes up this time motif again in the opening passage of the first chapter, as he describes Hans Castorp's trip to Davos. He observes the fungibility (though imperfect) of time and distance, noting that the effect of distance in changing Castorp's preoccupations is similar to the passage of a considerable stretch of time.

Studying English language and literature is different again because my mother tongue remains the strongest and my capacity to read more widely and deeply is not tempered by the constraints of comprehension of the language. The world is full of stories and every one gives me a better understanding of this earth and man and why I am here. My Open University course has forced me to read books I would never have chosen and like some bad tasting medicine that has done me nothing but good. I am currently writing an essay on “The Burial at Thebes” by Seamus Heaney (based on Sophocle’s ‘Antigone’). I would never in my life have picked up a classic if I were not studying and I would never have come across this quote by Seamus Heaney ‘I once said that the classics are like the longitude and latitude of consciousness in the West, they establish the first lines of thought and feelings.’

I did, and she did. The biggest thing that came out of this was that, instead of being angry and refusing to talk to me, she started talking to me more. I can’t say what she was thinking, but my guess is that she trusted me to tell her the truth because it was obvious that I didn’t care if she thought what I said offended her. I became one of the people she would come to when she knew things weren’t as pretty as everyone was telling her they were.

We headed to union square which had a Green Market and a Barnes and Noble which I was excited about visiting as I had read about it in books. I managed to pick up a copy of the new UK magazine 'Scrap 365' and I LOVED it. It reminded me a lot of the French magazine I get created by Celine Navarro called 'Entreartistes Magazine' except this one, I can actually read as it is written in English. We also picked up a New York guide book which broke down sightseeing here into areas/suburbs to help us make sure we see and do all we should here. Tomorrows plans are to visit a couple of markets, Central Park more and then head to a couple of shops I am keen on seeing 'Michaels' and 'Century 21' before we head back to the hotel for our NYE preparations in the heart of Times Square.

So, what should happen is this. In light of the lack of public consultations about the future of the strategic gap and the uncertainty about any future strategic gap policy, the BHA plan should be rejected on the grounds of ‘prematurity’. Then and only then can Adur and Lancing Parish work with the community to decide the right way forward and hopefully agree a policy that encourages growth and re-generation, but respects the rights of the local residents to ‘enjoy their property and their local amenity’ and protects our valuable ‘green wedges’ for use by ALL the community and not just a small minority.

I buy fresh fruits and veggies from the store and try not to use too many processed foods. But I'll be the first to admit that sometimes I use butter (gasp!), cream (gasp!) and eat red meat (GASP!).
It’s one thing to create a world, cultures, plants, foods . . .
The Ja Code proved its effectiveness when one of my classmates snatched my diary from my hands. I tried to get it back, but she kept it out of my reach. She was taller than I was. She opened my diary, and I was screaming Give it back! Give it back! She looked at the diary, held it close to her face, and said, Wow ang dami kong nabasa. She tossed the diary away with a sigh. She really wanted to read my diary.
Dan Riley is a major in the British Army. After a six month tour of duty in Afghanistan, he is coming home to the wife and young daughters he adores. The outside world sees those reunions as a taste of heaven after months of hell.
Jimi records a Clive Davis produced blues standards record with special guests Robert Cray, Buddy Guy, BB King, and Stevie Ray Vaughn. The album, Vintage Rider, reaches #17 on the charts and is considered by many critics and fans alike to be a return to Hendrix’s original blues roots. David Fricke calls it, “Hendrix’s best work since Live Onyx.”
I also didn't saute my veggies - I roasted them. There are few things that we love more than roasted broccoli. If you go this route all you have to do is toss your veggies with a little bit of olive oil and salt and pepper and roast at 425 for 15 - 20 minutes. I did this while I was waiting for the quinoa to cook. I used broccoli and green pepper this time but I think it would be fabulous with red pepper, asparagus or cauliflower as well.
All I’d ever wanted was an admission that they had got it wrong. If, in the response to my original letter, they’d have apologised for the freelance journalist getting some facts wrong, or admitted their sub editors had been a little heavy-handed, I would have left it there. But I was not prepared to be defamed in a national newspaper and then bullied into silence.

Knock back the dough and knead for a few minutes and form into 24 approximately even-sized buns, folding any creases underneath to make a nice, round shape. Place on non-stick pans, cover with plastic or a damp tea towel and leave to double in size again.
Filled with wholesome themes typical of a Frank Capra film – particularly that of the triumph of the common man over the corrupt leader, it is one of the original “feel good” movies. “It’s a Wonderful Life” also made me fall in love with James Stewart. He was such a nice guy. As a child, I began asking my father, the resident movie buff, for “more Jimmy Stewart.” My father came back with 1939′s “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,” (another Capra/Stewart collaboration) and 1958′s “Vertigo.”
No one knew who was checked in or out or which tests were which. ‘Sorry Mrs Earnshaw you’re expecting twins’ - don’t bleeding think so. ( only joking – but that’s how unorganised it was) It was ace, lots of frantic dashing about, arguing, shaking of heads – chaos. Only the ‘fagash lils’ outside remained calm – totally oblivious to the madness inside. Back to the old days of getting called for your appointment by a real live person.
Olive has recently given their menu a facelift and it makes us smile. It almost looks like one of those tacky laminated menu cards, illustrated with photographs, from Denny's. Perhaps that is the joke? At least Olive don't include any tacky pictures of the food. Most of what is on offer is the same as before, they have added to rather than change customer favourites.

Please don’t give up on those dreams. We need you to hold tenaciously to the very stuff of your heart. The fabric of you that God ingrained in us when He created our very soul, the literal heart-beat of who He wanted you and I to be and become. Parenthood has a way of stretching and pulling at that tender fabric until we’re tempted to rip it out of our lives and leave it behind, pained by its insistent cry for us to pick it up again.
After Jesse checked me and found I was 8 cm a little after 7 pm, I found a new wave of resolve. Almost there! Dawn suggested having Jesse break my water to see if that might move things along a little quicker. As long as I could get back in the tub, I was okay with that! Jesse’s shift was also ending, so Ondrea came in to take over for her as all this was happening. Very shortly after, I was back in the tub! Looking at this picture, I still have a hard time believing that this was what I looked like at 7:27 pm! Am I asleep? My surges quickly changed and I felt the urge to start the birth process and help this baby out. Contractions were one on top of the other, with barely time to breathe in between. All I remember feeling at this time was the urge to push – I wasn’t uncomfortable. I had singular focus.

Abba Father ‘Joshua’s words to the Israelites prompt me to search my heart. You have done so much for me. You have rescued me, redeemed me, and brought me into Your kingdom. Rekindle my desire to serve You today, and let my example inspire others to serve You as well.’ In the name of Christ Jesus who lives within me through the Holy Spirit I pray that You create in me a clean heart, and renew a right spirit within me, for my one walk in and with Jesus today. Make me a channel of Your peace, standing having girded my waist with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod my feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which I will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. Always asking that You bless me and mine in fulfillment of Your will and keep us from evil and pain; reminding us that if we get nothing else done this day, let us spend it loving You and others first, as You love us. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

Martha finally blinked, her eyes stinging with the effort of her previous, vacant stare as she considered what this meant. She didn’t have cancer. She wasn’t sick. She was carrying a child instead of a tumour. A child that she and Eric would care for and nurture and guide through life, school, college, university. A child that they could spoil with presents and family holidays and friendly sleepovers. A child that was, at this moment, growing inside her belly that she would carry for nine months until, finally, they could meet a tiny, screwed up pink baby that would cost them the earth and keep them up all night worrying about fevers and teething and if the newly decorated house was child-proofed enough to prevent any fatal mishaps.
The sad, sad skin on my chinny-chin-chin has been a dermatological conundrum since having my babies. I'd like to blame this "little dude," for part of that, but I can't...he's too "kiss-that-face-off" adorable.

Although many people are hesitant to put their home on the market during the winter months, this isn’t always a bad idea. Consider the cost of owning your home for a longer period of time, and weigh them against the benefits of a possible sale during the winter. Your liability for paying annual property taxes will continue to increase as long as your house remains unsold, for example. Winter heating and water bills are the most expensive, so try selling a home before this season.

We learned about the ostrich. We compared an ostrich egg to a chicken egg- I explained to my students that I got the ostrich egg at Lion Country Safari. The kids were very impressed and full of questions. Then, I pulled out the chicken egg to lead a comparison lesson and the kids wanted to know where I got the chicken egg!! I told the class Publix and they were MORE impressed. I had to explain that the eggs we eat ARE chicken eggs. --- makes me a little worried about what they learned during the Farm Unit! We learned that male ostrich have black feathers and female have brown so the boys made black hand print feathers and the girls made brown. Download the Ostrich data collection here.
I've also cooked a pan of brown rice which I'll just put in a container and stick in the fridge. I can put it in a bowl with some kale and that can be either breakfast or lunch for me. Midway through the week, we'll want a quick and easy dinner. I'll get out the rice, the wok, chop up whatever veggies I have in the fridge that need to be used - broccoli, leeks, celery, green onions, carrots, bok choy - whatever I have. I'll grab the aminos or soy sauce and whatever vinegar happens to sound good at the moment, and we'll enjoy a wonderful fried rice. (I knew I should have grabbed that box of fortune cookies at the store the other day!)

“I found him, He is about seventy feet back and to the left of me. Give or take… In between two buildings I think… There are two other guys with him, and two girls… The girls are human Jessie. We have to stop him.” Close to her ear, as quiet as I can I whisper all this. No need to alarm any one when I can handle it quietly. Rex really should know better by now though.
I’d endured boring David & Ruth’s choice of boring books for their children which never seemed to move beyond moaning about having to read a boring Postman Pat book over again. “Get to the mobile library van, fools!” I’d shout, although now we’re all in Austerity Ambridge, that’s no longer a likely scene.

The key to this is never forcing it. It cannot be hurried or forced. These energies are unstoppable. Of course, they work with your free choice. We do not remove free choice, but you are filled with such energy as you are going to start to note that your choices are shifting, and they are shifting to a higher vibration. This sense of exhaustion — and it may fluctuate — is going to also be filled with times of exuberance and unlimited energy, as if you could circle the globe three times flying with me and still want to go on further.

So then a couple days ago I went to go to the bathroom and had to put her down and had no where to set her right then so I laid her on her on her stomach and like usual she was lookin around, and then all of a sudden she very quickly rolled over to her back and cooed at the ceiling. She did it like she’d been doing it for years and I couldnt even jump up and hurray about it because as you recall I was currently using the bathroom…. what are the odds. So then as soon as I can I grab her up and rush to the living room to find any living soul possible to show how wonderfully she can roll over and when I lay her back on her stomach she wobbles from side to side then cried her eyes out. So I picked her up and didnt try again.

Villages/towns of Caesarea Philippi: Apparently Jesus and the disciples went not to the Hellenized Caesarea itself, but to the “suburbs” of that city, the villages nearby which it controlled. The idea is presumably, as in Mark 9:30-31, to isolate themselves for intense teaching.

Alone in my kitchen…I was surrounded by silence. Again, I felt a little stupid, and hated myself for it. No matter what, it seems that I continued to read more into this man than was really there. Over and over again, I seemed to make the same mistakes. Really, to him, we WERE just friends, and I became convinced that I was the one that was messing things up.
I love my Mother Kaisu very much. She is 80 years old and she has been working hard all her life. Her life can be read form every little line in her hands. Yet her hands are very soft and I love the tender touch of them when she strokes my hair. Her hands are the most beautiful creation I have seen not only in their appearance but also for the strength and love that they carry. Knowing that my Mother clasps her hands in prayer every day gives me strength and hope for the future.

So, it seems, your pension – the sum you get each month in retirement (as calculated on page 9 of the USS leaflet) – will in fact be made up of two parts. One part which will rise each year in line with CPI, and another part which won’t fully. The second part will rise in line with CPI up to 5%, but after that, anything above 5% will only rise by half as much. So, 6% CPI will see a rise of 5.5% in your pension (5% plus half of 1%) and a 7% rise in CPI will see a 6% rise in your pension (5% plus half of 2%). What it doesn’t mention is that 15% is the ‘hard cap’. If CPI goes above 15%, you will not get anything more than a 10% increase to your pension (5% plus half of 10%).
So, to recap, no checks, no check card.

I’ve always considered it an incredible privilege to write nonfiction, as you get to snoop in private lives via letters, diaries, etc., in order to tell your story. That said, in writing on some historical subjects, particularly the lives of women, these sources are not always readily available. I found that I could use the research I had done and expand upon it imaginatively in a way that was

Some sets included “analytical” words (i.e.,”reason,” “think”), and others non-analytical words (“hammer,” “jump”). There were 50 individuals in the analytical test and 43 in the controls.

It brings me to something I was thinking about earlier. . . That quote, “would you rather be right or be kind?”
As livestock graze a pasture, they affect forage composition, plant canopy structure and the growth rate of the forage. These changes in the pasture forage, in turn, affect the animals’ grazing behavior and their ability to obtain their needed supply of nutrients.

Social media conditions the mainstream media, as do bloggers. The blogger has become the journalist's friend - as shown by the Guardian's latest advert for its 'open journalism' project; see the picture accompanying this blog post - and there are numerous stories that take events in social media as their main point of reference each week all around the world. What is happening is that the mainstream media is adjusting its focus to accommodate these new players in the public sphere. When a tweeter can be sued by an editor for accurately conveying what a citizen journalist recorded during a public forum, the game has changed forever. And Zivkovic is right to applaud the growing number of scientists who are occupying a place in the communication chain. Zivkovic calls himself a "science writer" despite, he says, "never going to j-school". He writes on blogs.

If we analyze their writings, we find all the classic reactions of people who have been disappointed in love. But no one dreams of criticizing them for their past, even though it has marked them forever. They may well have been converted, but they have not changed…. no one notices the constants, even though they are glaringly obvious. Their best sellers prove, thanks to the support of the most indulgent and slothful critics anyone could hope for, that the public can be fooled. No one denounces or even notices the arrogance of both yesterday’s eulogies and today’s diatribes; no one cares that there is never any proof and that invective is used in place of analysis. Their inverted hyper-Stalinism-which takes the usual form of total manicheanism-is whitewashed simply because it is directed against Communism. The hysteria has not changed, but it gets a better welcome in its present guise.

On the first of May, we confirm that the first step is to end the current Palestinian division and political disintegration and put aside narrow factional interests in the interests of the unity of the people and their struggle. Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza are still suffering from aggression, siege, starvation, and crisis, and this means that unity must come first, and unity is the inalienable choice of the Palestinian people. At the same time building an economy of resistance and national steadfastness must be an economic priority before any other interest, to protect workers, economic and social rights, fight corruption, adopt the minimum wage and social protection in order to end the situation of work in the settlements and return instead to the cultivation of agriculture and protection and development of sectors, sources, and natural and productive resources, and salvation from dependence on the market and the occupation economy.

And a quick reminder that Tuesday's post has a prize, too, in addition to the Unity prize.
A few weeks ago, I had an interview for a scholarship that I applied for. It was a chance of a lifetime; to spend a year studying abroad. The few days before the interview, I was a nervous wreck. Naturally, like everyone, I was scared of failure and rejection. Over-analyzing everything that would possibly happen, questioning my abilities and terrified about making a bad impression… Yes, I’m a paranoid mess. Everything was flowed smoothly in the interview though, mostly because the interviewers were extremely nice and created a comfortable atmosphere (as opposed to the horrid and intimidating process I predicted it to be). The wait for the results was agonizingly painful and impatience definitely took its toll. Reality hit me when I wasn’t chosen for the scholarship. What did I do wrong? Was it something I said? I knew the competition was tough but it hit me hard, possibly because I believe I actually stood a chance. A week later, a phone call came as an opportunity to have my questions answered. I was to meet the Director of Student Development Services to discuss my performance.

Nothing’s Shocking hit the world like a musical meteor. The album had songs that any music listener could get into. The topics were edgy (for the time) and Perry Farrell’s vocal styling’s and voice effects were fascinating and unprecedented. The drumming was tribal and progressive, the bass playing was punkish, and the guitar style mixed the best of glam, hard rock, and psychedelic soundscapes. “What do they sound like?” was a very hard question to answer about Jane’s Addiction. They sounded like…Jane’s Addiction. If you saw them in concert at the time you witnessed a pre-Lollapalooza gathering of all types of music fans: goths, punks, metalheads, hippies, rockers, skaters, indie kids, alt kids, any kind of kids were present at a Jane’s show. They were a “cross over act” while receiving very little radio or MTV play outside of 120 Minutes and/or Headbangers Ball (Jane’s being one of the few bands at the time that could be played on either show legitimately). Songs like “Jane Says” were catchy enough to attract the ballad-loving listeners from the softer side of the hard rock landscape while “Pigs In Zen,” Had A Dad,” and “Ted, Just Admit It…” were aggressive and deep enough for the Black Flag crowd and “Standing In The Shower…Thinking” and “Idiot’s Rule” were danceable and upbeat so the Grateful Dead twirlers could join the party. Metalheads could get into “Mountain Song” and “Up The Beach” without loosing their “heavy” credentials and the stoners could most definitely zone out to “Summertime Rolls” on repeat for hours. It’s a masterful blend of rhythms, tones, and textures that seldom come together more perfectly and creatively than when a great band is at it’s peak.
Bearing this in mind, at stake now for both sides is “who’s got the upper hand” and, more simply put, who is the “better devil” in today’s politics.

The down side, a lot of the “newbies” don’t come to us. At least, not initially. Those who are set on their path or whom are looking for a coven/group to celebrate esbats and sabbats with, generally gravitate to one of the local covens or the ATC wiccan church here in Memphis. When, or if they decide they want to explore the “meat” of their spiritual path, then that’s when they generally come to us at SG.

One theme that I have been noticing is that, with the wedding so close, it makes me think about my relationship with Chris in a different way. Mostly what that means is that conversations about the future surface more -- and not in the "isn't it fun to dream about the future" kind of way, but in the "how are we actually going to make this happen?" kind of way.

If you are to truly ‘fit in’ to your community, just drinking Rakia is not enough, you’ll need to actually make it. It’s best to get your local ‘Mistor’ to help the first year, as there is a little more to making it than simply filling barrels full of rotting fruit, (unless you actually intend on blinding friends and neighbours.) Once made though, you will have enormous pride in your creation, foisting it on anyone who approaches your door. However be warned, it can be a little dangerous to spend a long dark winter knowing you have 50 litres of 60+ proof alcohol in your shed.

That is why Tan Sri Robert Phang asked A-G Gani Patail to clear the air. Instead of doing that, proxy attacks by UMNO bloggers are now being launched incessantly against Robert Phang.

It was the first annual Festival of One Act Plays at our college. I was a junior, and that semester had been a difficult one for me emotionally. That was my "black semester": I was depressed, bitter, careless, hardened. I had always been a pretty happy person, but I was losing myself, trading optimism for cynicism, looking for cold alleyways instead of spacious places.
Given this is my first blog, I was very proud of my work and put a lot of effort into making it as controversial as possible. And what brings up more discussion than our favorite quarterback in the NFL, Tim Tebow? As an athlete, I would say that ESPN and ESPN2 are my top 2 most frequently watched channels. So what better way to break writer’s block than to write about sports. My fingers jumped around the keyboard and my ideas were flowing. Thus, To Tebow or not Tebow? That is the Question was created. Right away controversy was at hand, with people either praising my work or scrutinizing it for its vulgar and ruthless opinions. I thought I had this down, blogging wasn’t going to be so hard. Then reality hit.
To be clear, as it may not be to some, the purpose of using the spit and feet is so that the seeds can read what toxins and dis-ease are in our bodies, and then acquire the elements to combat them. In this way, our gardens literally become our own personally taliored pharmacies. Seeds are magical things. They really are. Anastasia is right.

No. The dire outcome he had discovered was still on course. Most of the experts disputed it, of course. He was dubbed Judd, the Harbinger of Doom and generally laughed at. He had stopped giving lectures months ago and started devoting all of his time to experimentation. The government dollars were almost unlimited, and the university was happy to give him the time and the space to work. Volunteers were his only problem. Other than a couple of Gen Ed students, both whom he'd contacted through the Astronomy lab, no one had come forth. For the mechanics of his device all that was required was the ability to make ones mind a blank, or to conjure up inane thoughts. For Judd it was a struggle, but he had slowly mastered the process.

Preparing to meet with darkness, as the light of day slowly recedes into the gentle evening, I am almost imperceptibly sliding into melancholy, mixed with a mild sense of relief to be without obligation of any sort for the moment. Regardless of being destined to return to the obligations waiting in the wings, there is a subtle hint of delight descending upon me in this moment, as I sit under the ever-deepening purple panorama of the night sky. Having spent the past few hours reviewing my working files and research papers in a folder labeled, “Contemplating Consciousness,” upon reflection, I am frequently struck by the power of my own words to myself.

(Btw I get a load of stuff in my inbox and I rarely ever do anything with it so this is legit good stuff ya'll.) Seeing as how I'm in the middle of the renovation of our next home, I'm all about some pretty design inspiration.

By Monday Dec 27th, it was becoming obvious that this family was going to have a HUGE uphill battle trying to convince their agency to let them proceed. The family was also having trouble with their Social Worker and funding issues. I contacted the advocate and offered a donation to this family to help with their funding issues. In the meantime, I had talked to CP about this boy and got a "No". It wasn't so much the boy himself, just that we would be adding TWO boys at once to our family of four children.

Paul has never had the slightest chance of being the GOP nominee, and I think he'd be absurdly easy to beat -- much of America doesn't know the first thing about his newsletters, or about how his sunny-sounding libertarianism would in fact lay waste to cherished programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment insurance (even more so than the programs of his GOP opponents). The attack ads would write themselves -- and Paul wouldn't even deny what he intended to do to the safety net.

I few days ago, I told you about my dance therapy. My hope is that by moving in rhythm to a few peppy songs most days, I can train myself to feel lighter in spirit, maybe even learn to have fun — whatever that is. And it’s working. I started out by getting teary-eyed during my sessions (“session” makes it seem as if it’s really therapy, but the truth is, I just dance in my room ). This morning, though, while dancing to one of the songs from my rockabilly collection, I actually felt a lightness of spirit. Of course, it’s almost impossible to be sad while dancing to Eddie Cochran. (What can I say? I love rockabilly, though I never even heard any of the songs, not even the oldest ones, until the 1990′s. Such a deprived life I led!)

Similarly, for Ethiopia, the massive amount of water generated by the huge annual rainfall, but the fact that nearly all of the 111 bcm flowed to neighboring states, prompted (until the last decade) the “sovereign right” position to use the waters within its territory for its own national development. For Ethiopia the loss of huge volumes of soil in the annual flood also underlined the fact that it could be resource rich and poor at the same time unless the resources could be harnessed more effectively. The nature of dependence on resources received externally against internal renewable resources is illustrated in Figure 6. (See original publication)

I also went to the Philadelphia Flower Show, a tradition I started with my mom for my birthday! We get lunch in China Town and then head over to the convention center for the show. I was involved with the show in high school and have gone to it every year since.

The sample of autistic children in Roberts et al. (in press) is of course very small, as is charateristic of the bulk of the autism literature, and much can happen within such small sample. But these data aren't inconsistent with numerous other existing reports, and deserve at least a look while we wait, patiently, for the DSM-V people to proclaim on autism "severity."

At this time last year, the lunatics were in full command of the asylum. Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, John Kerry and a supporting cast of thousands were jetting off to Copenhagen to swear their undying allegiance to the idea that it is necessary to save the planet from the scourge of human life. That would be human life, most particularly, as it is lived here in the United States and other parts of the world that have not yet gotten around to pulling the plug on capitalism and moving on to a more enlightened way of organizing production and redistributing material wealth.
My East Midlands Journey Planner told me quite clearly that the quickest way to Ripley was a train to Alfreton, wait 20 minutes and get a bus to Ripley.

Before you start wondering, I would like to narrate a recent incident. I was in Bhopal having dinner at the Jehan Numa Palace’s famed restaurant “Under The Mango Tree” when I saw Jaya Bachchan walk in with a few friends & relatives. Obviously all heads turned in her direction including mine but there was no pandemonium. She sat at the next table, ordered food & drinks and they started having peaceful conversations. Once the dinner was over I decided to go and talk to her which I did. I congratulated Jaya aunty for becoming a grand mother and reminded her of my previous meeting with her at the Delhi airport when she was with Amitabh uncle, Abhishek and Anil Ambani – all returning to Bombay in Anil’s private jet post her (and Anil’s) oath in the Rajya Sabha – which she, of course, did not remember but seemed to be happy talking about – and I genuinely complimented on her still maintained elegance and charm! She thanked me profusely and then I requested for a photograph with her. Jaya aunty very sweetly declined saying “it is an extremely private dinner; there are so many people around who too would like to do the same; hope you will understand and not mind … God bless you.” I understood of course and did not mind also! Three days later when I was returning to Delhi, I again saw her walk inside the airport wearing a beautiful dress looking every inch a “Guddi”! She had a bit of harried expression around her. Had she spent a few minutes around, I would have gone to her again, requesting her to pose for a picture with me – this time at a public place, giving her no opportunity to refuse! … Her departure started a discussion about this entire phenomenon called “celebrity-admirer” relationship. And I decided to pen down my thoughts. So, here I am …

In 2004, my sister bought me a white Xmas tree. I bought a large urn, and use it as the base of the white tree and placed the tree in the dining room. This was theme #5 Apples, Pears with a touch of red. Again I went to the Rag Shop Xmas eve and bought reddish/burgundy/goldish pears and apples and decorated the tree.
And then out of the dark came my father’s precious, long-fingered hand and found mine. Tenderly, reassuringly, his clasp tightened. It let up a bit, tightened again, this time hard. He didn’t say a word, didn’t even look at me. But comfort, understanding, and reassurance flowed from his hand to my heart, and I was healed.

Morphing underground noise scene origins into something more befitting 1980s Sheffield, Cold Cave's 2009 debut Love Comes Close betrayed its ultimate impact from title down.

I learned to make this salad in school when I was 13 years old. I still make it the same way, although on occasion I'll change things up a bit. I have been known to add an entire tin of anchovy fillets because I love them so much. I couldn't imagine caesar salad without them, but if you don't care for them, then leave them out and use a bit of salt in their place.
The Gospel is an amazing and powerful gift; it’s one we shouldn’t be ashamed of. However, we are right to worry about being the Trixies of the world. Knowing that Trixie’s magic is antagonistic and Twilight’s is cooperative, perhaps we can always consider the test: Is it loving? We never spread the gospel in spite of our loving instincts. The two are in full agreement. On this matter, silence is not the most loving pattern, but neither is sign-boarding, cash-hoarding, and self-rewarding. It’s being willing to step up to the stage to confront the Trixies and Ursas that approach Ponyville.

The gameplay is fun, the graphics are outstanding, the storylines are almost all stellar, and the game continues to get better as more features are added with each patch. If you have never played World of Warcraft or another MMORPG it may take some getting used to, but if you have, you can pretty capably jump right in and enjoy it from the get go. You might not ever run into Princess Leia needing your help, but as far as science fiction MMORPGs go this is pretty much the only option worth your time. Star Wars fans will enjoy it. If you don’t like Star Wars, you won’t. It is as simple as that.

There are a lot of horror RPGs out there and around this time of year is when all the GMs out there start breaking them out. I’ve run more than a few in my day (I ran a whole Ravenloft campaign way back in the day), and I’ve had my mix of successes and failures. By success, of course, I mean the games were actively freaky and frightening. By ‘failure’, I mean everybody merely had the same good time they had during all other RPGs. That’s okay and everything, but let’s face it–if you’re playing or running Call of Cthulhu, you intend for it to be a frightening/thrilling experience.

I would love to have a lengthy pool in my community that I could lap swim on off running days or as a follow up to a hard running workout. As much as I enjoy an early morning run in the darkness, I enjoy early morning swims as well. There is something refreshing to swimming hard laps in the morning and then getting ready for work or wherever you are going. I did it a couple of times when I was in a different situation and it was delightful. I wish I could have that again. I wish that at night to wrap up a hard day of working out, I could just jump in the pool and peel off a few laps. I wish that there was a nice pond/lake near where I live (animal free) that I could grab a swim in. I wish that I could use swimming for a happy, keep fit , low impact, alternative to boost my fitness and endurance so that when I pound the pavement the following day I am a step (or stroke better) than I was before.

Journals: Prophets have long counseled that church members keep a journal recording their daily activities. President Spencer W. Kimball taught that a personal journal should not delve “into the ugly phases of the life he is portraying. … Even a long life full of inspiring experiences can be brought to the dust by one ugly story.” Therefore, journals should be uplifting but never negative, which isn’t a problem because that is how most LDS lives are lived.
Let’s start with an overview first. There are a few major themes one should notice about Genesis 1, the first of which is a theme of separation. Consider the following verses:

But if that is all one knows or says about the topic of slavery in Scripture, then one knows very little indeed. Some may think that this is all they need to know; in their righteous crusade, things like context mean nothing. With all the zeal of the iconoclasts, whom they would ironically identify as enemy religious fanatics, they rush in with rhetorical sledgehammers swinging wildly at any textual object that displeases them, hoping to use the fragments to gut and impale their helpless opponents.
Why It Worked: El Jefe is a German-style Hefeweizen, which means that it's heavy in banana, orange and clove flavors. The amuse-bouche served its purpose and let us know that the new sous chef was serious about impressing us. A dish of fried parma ham was topped with cantaloupe that had been prepared in tiny balls the size of salmon roe and was dressed with tiny congealed balsamic drops and olive oil. The melon matched the citrus and banana flavors fantastically, while the salty fried ham helped cut through the heavy body of the beer. The clove flavors complimented the ham and the beer ensured that the intense ham did not overpower the palate.

It seems that people are really taking all the anti-drink messages to heart and curbing their intake. However, it doesn’t apply evenly across the board – those who wish to be responsible and health-conscious are reducing what is already often a very modest level of consumption, while problem drinkers of all kinds carry on regardless. In the process, drinking becomes increasingly denormalised and seen as something socially unacceptable, which is obviously bad news for the pub trade. Britain’s drink problem – if it has one at all – is not that we consume too much as a society, but that it is distributed too unevenly. What we need are more responsible, regular, moderate drinkers, but sadly the tide of anti-drink hysteria is driving us in the opposite direction.
My quarters actually had a good day. We worked on some pre-STAAR activities and I taught them a game or two. It felt good, even though some things didn't go as planned. Yay x 3.
We all wondered if they were together, and if so—she’s got moves y’all. Or maybe she’s got powers? Was he under a spell? We were dazed and confused by our pool table. How did we get there? Why was she talking to us? Etc. etc. etc. Suddenly, from the outside window–knocking from the other side! She stood there pointing at my friend with her fingers.

While I’ve typically been pretty good about keeping up this blog with a post every couple days, I’ve had a hard time doing so lately. I do have a good reason, though, as I was extremely busy preparing for the 2012 PDSE (Peer Delivered Syringe Exchange) Conference.
I loved the workshop, and thankyou very much to our group leader, Andrew. You helped a lot, and we could not have done it without you. I don’t think anything could be improved, the workshop was perfect.
To start, I’m mixing up some good ideas with my handsome friend Jd White. (check out his work here – http://jdwhitephoto.com/). Last summer, he did a shoot of the girls on our kickball team and well, you can see why I want to keep working with him.
Now can anyone who has not experienced this please take a moment to imagine the layers of pain and shame and inner-torment this situation causes, when it has been lived over and over and over again, for months, years, decades in some cases.

It was a bold decision in 2011 for Red Bull to develop their own Battery system for the Renault Marelli KERS. Not wanting to sacrifice wheelbase and fuel tank volume with under-tank mounted batteries, instead Newey mounted the batteries near the gearbox. In fact three batteries packs were fitted, one larger pack either side of the gearbox and a small array inside the top of the gearbox case. Exposed to more heat and vibration the KERS caused problems throughout 2011 and led to the driver having it unavailable at critical points in qualifying and races. I understand the battery positions remain for this year. It was never clear if Red Bull actually had a full power KERS in 2011. The rumours persisted of a Mini-KERS, suggesting the system discharged nearer 40Kw, rather than the maximum allowable 60Kw.
Though my family lived only ten or fifteen minutes from the downtown area, one could see a distinct difference between our neighborhoods and the littered streets of Arcania. Buildings of several eras condensed into even blocks, ranging from simple, modern brick to massively old Gothic structures. Some shops were still lucky enough to be open, but I noticed many “Out of Business” signs mixed with boarded up windows. Dad, Arcania City’s DA, often mentioned how crime had gone up in the last few years, with several break-ins, robberies, and flat out harassment. It made him so angry that he couldn’t do enough to fix it.

Have you ever tried to roll two bags up an unpaved slope of dirt and rock? How ’bout down one? “Are you doing alright?” I asked my aunt periodically as we stopped to rest on the way to our room. I was stopping more often than she was as my duffel bag shifted and flopped and toppled my flow every 20 yards or so of the near-milelong trek. All the way down the hill, we talked breathlessly about how blessed we were to get this special room in this special location all to ourselves. My suitcase hit a crater and toppled. My aunt kept going, fearing the loss of momentum. “I’ll meet you there,” I said, muttering in a way that might be considered profane.

Also important in keeping your eyelids comfortable and de-puffed is sleeping with your head elevated. I realize not everyone's a back sleeper -- and for most of my life neither was I. But not only does sleeping "sunny side up," with your head elevated 30-ish degrees, keep your face free of sleep wrinkles (it's a real phenomenon, I wouldn't lie to you) and your skincare treatments on your face rather than your pillowcase, but the gentle force of gravity pulls fluids down and out of your face so you don't wake up with puffy eyelids. I sleep propped up on a cushy bank of pillows, with another stashed under my knees to ease the pressure on my lower back. I'll admit, I don't look like Sleeping Beauty, but I think I wake up looking and feeling refreshed as she.

If you're anything like me you have dozens of cookbooks gathering dust on your bookshelves, some of which have never even been cooked from. Sure I spent hours browsing through them when I first bought them, marking all the recipes I was going to make with little post-it notes, and yet still those books languish in the bookcase and never make it to the kitchen. There are others from which I have made but one recipe which was such a resounding success that I've made it over and over again, and yet somehow I've never made anything else from that book. Sound a bit familiar?!

Okay, so the story seems to be that Joey is in the emergency room hunting stories when they drag in a guy with bloody chains dangling out of him and a black haired goth-looking chick. The guy with the chains has a seizure from Hell as the chains whip out and start to attack everyone and electrocute him somehow – it’s never really explained, don’t worry; the movie isn’t getting any smarter on us magically. Joey of course thinks this is the coolest thing ever and wants to do a story about it!
This is what the U.S. and U.N. does. Do you know how long they pressed sanctions on Iraq to try to destroy the country before they finally invaded based on lies? And who suffers the most? The ordinary citizen, of course. The message is simple. If you, as a people, refuse to overthrow your government, we will choke the life out of you. We will destroy your country by destroying your economy. And to the leaders we say, if your people do not want you overthrown, we will crush their lives for supporting you, until finally, they turn against you as the only means of fighting off starvation.

I was most wowed by an incredibly athletic troupe of Russian acrobats who flung each other into the air with breathtaking dare. Seconds after I took the photo below, this tiny woman - one of that troupe - tossed the flaming hoop high into the air, then she herself was flung up high by the two fellows supporting the narrow bendy board on which she stood, and she somersaulted mid-air through the flaming hoop only to land upright and un-singed on the narrow board again!

I’ve been slightly annoyed at myself the past two weeks, because I haven’t been able (or inclined, honestly) to work out in the way that I had been pre-Japan and pre-back pain. In my own defense, getting back onto a schedule and sleep pattern has been really rough, and I think I really needed these two weeks in order to be back to feeling ‘normal’.
When brain cells die during a stroke, abilities controlled by that area of the brain are lost. These abilities include speech, movement and memory.

I’m particularly obsessed with his song “Magdalena.” It’s a song about forgiveness, set in Mexico. His lyrics are brilliant. He just reminds me that forgiveness–and God–are found everywhere, and that it doesn’t matter what wrong you have committed. Those wrongs will always be made right. But Mr. Flowers doesn’t stop there–forgiveness isn’t easy. It’s not instant, there’s no modern methods around it, its ultimate happiness is difficult to obtain, it’s personal. It’s a journey of the soul. A quest. No, a conquest. It’s a triumph.

Down in Lockport, Lukas Verzbicas went about his business as well winning that Sectional in 15:09. The time doesn't seem that impressive on paper until you realize that the course record there was previously 15:15 set in the 2007 season by one Chris Derrick. Enough said. Many people are looking to the battle brewing next week downstate in Peoria between Driggs and Verzbicas. Lukas has never lost a cross country race in his high school career and in fact, doesn't appear to have had a strong challenge in a high school race. Even at FL Nationals last year he made it look easy. Go to the FL website and watch the replay sometime. I think that Driggs is going to be up for the task of challenging him. The question of will Lukas beat Craig Virgin's course record has to be asked along with, will Driggs go with him? It's going to be a great meet on Saturday both individually and with the teams. Look for Neuqua Valley to challenge York and New Trier.

The beginning of the new year (plus a few days off work to stare at my house) gets me itching to organize. Seriously, sometimes I feel like a mini hoarder. Our house is clean and I only have two cats, but I keep a lot of random stuff. Matt says I turn each area into an “everything drawer” or an “everything closet”. I don’t want our house to turn into an “everything house”, so I’ve gotta organize.
Suppressing our capacity for reason, we raise the pursuit of money to the status of a sacred mission, failing to notice that money is nothing but a number of no intrinsic value and that we are destroying the real wealth of people, community, and nature to grow the numbers on financial asset statements.

Even outside the political literature, one of the major writers on conservatism in the psychology literature was aware at least as long ago as 1978 of the highly conditional relationship between dictionary-type conservatism and Rightism (Wilson, 1978) but it was obviously too much to expect that Altemeyer would keep up with the work of the major writers in his own field.

YEAST PRESS - 'This is not being used meantime, and until beers are all right, I have advised its disuse. When things are going well, and probably about the month of November when the cold weather is with us, I think it would then be very advisable to have it started up, as it means a big saving of duty free beer, the beer contained in yeast being equal to 1 to 2% and duty free at that, means a large saving per annum if properly pressed at the right time.'"

I only had to do about 140 km today, which isn't that much, but of course I couldn't even find my way out of Oslo properly. I blame it on the roadworks and the rain clouds, which prevented me from seeing the sun and any shadows, which in turn prevented me from knowing what direction I was heading in. I found my way out in the end though, not to worry. When I finally got out of Oslo, the roads were actually pretty decent. Until we came to Drammen and from there on the maximum speed was only 70km/hour. If you were lucky!

On April 14th 2011, we set out on our biggest adventure ever, sealing the deal in the Sacramento Temple. We cannot even describe what a wonderful day it was. We were sealed at 11:00 am by Jessica's Grandfather, Jay Smith. What a special experience that was! It was so wonderful to have him be the one to say those special words and perform that sacred and wonderful ordinance. The spirit was strong, and there were so many loving faces there to support us. Truly a day that will be treasured for all of time and eternity. Many thanks to two wonderful sets of parents that made all of this possible for us. We couldn't be luckier! Our hearts are full of love and gratitude for them as well as a loving Father in Heaven who led us to each other. We have both experienced many tender mercies in our lives, but this tops all!

Oh, by the way! Apart from the fact that the EDL guy in the video is clearly drunk, very young, and maybe even a little nervous, what’s funny about a Northern accent? It's a Northern accent, Howard, you know, people Up ‘t’ North speak that way. They don’t speak in the way they do in Leamington Spa or at university - unless they are students or middle class. So stop being such a racist and snob against Northerners and the white working class... But that’s OK nowadays, isn’t it?

And so I went off, at the end of that summer, to divinity school—and a trajectory that led to working in church. I was excited about the opportunity to provide ways to lay a solid foundation to teenagers—especially as they moved from a concrete way of thinking to a more abstract way of thinking and reasoning. I wanted to help them learn about the world around them—its craziness, its brokenness, its pain, its beauty, its mystery. I wanted to help them engage that world in a way that was meaningful and authentic for them and who each of them was as a child of God. And I wanted all of us to have a little fun along the way.

As humans we have a tendency to look forward to the next big thing. This is what happens for many of us from Thanksgiving through the end of the holiday season. We spend a month in preparation and anticipation, looking forward to the big day, Christmas, and all the festivities that go along with it. But then, in the blink of an eye, it’s over and we look forward to the next big thing… New Year’s is just a week away so we don’t have to wait too long for more celebration. But then, just like that, it’s over, and this time there’s nothing but real life to look forward to for the next few months. This is when the post-holiday blues set in because there’s nothing very big for us to hang our hope for happiness on until summer vacation. How do we kick this depression that so many of us slip into during this time of year?
This hysteria of course produces the usual untruths and misinformation from our enemies.

But I finished, and I beat my time last year by 16 minutes. Final time: 3 hrs, 30 min, and 36 seconds. Not bad (for walking). The average half-marathon time was 2 hrs, 26 minutes. Those are people who jog a good portion of it, which I didn't. I walked. I jogged a few short bursts, but that was more to use different muscles than to actually try to get somewhere. Still, 16 minutes is pretty good to shave off my final time.
Again, the solution is not that easy. According to the New York Times two new studies are challenging the notion of lack of access to fresh food in low-income neighborhoods. The studies show that while poor, urban neighborhoods have a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants and convenience stores, they also have more grocery stores, supermarkets and full-serve restaurants. They don’t lack access to healthy options. The study concludes there is no relationship between the type of food available in a neighborhood and obesity rates among its children and adolescents.
When presented with a question of what art is, neo-soul recording artist D’Angelo once implied that all we know about art is contained in those three words. He saw ‘art’ as the bridge that allowed the ordinary – ‘thou’ – to connect with the Divine – ‘God’. In framing his response as such, then, D’Angelo suggests that all the pursuit of art really is, is our eternal struggle to mimic that which we envision as existing on a higher plane of existence than we.

One of the questions I'm invariably asked when I tell people I'm reading Ian Fleming's James Bond novels is: "Aren't they a bit sexist?" (The other question is even shorter: "Really?" – often accompanied by an arched eyebrow.) This line of enquiry probably dates back to Paul Johnson's 1958 New Statesman review/essay "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", which he wrote after reading the sixth book in the series, Dr. No, but more recently the question of Bond's misogyny in the novels has become conflated with the on-screen antics of the movie Bond(s) (see here, here, here...). Because for some people, many of whom I suspect have never read Fleming's novels, the Bond of the films and the Bond of the books equate to pretty much the same man: a smirking smoothie who shags his way through at least two floozies every story.

On Wednesday night, this scripture passage,1 John 3:1, kept popping into my head as I witnessed my oldest daughter receiving the gifts of the Holy Spirit in the Sacrament of Confirmation. She is God's gift to me, a call to live my life not for myself but for Christ, and I am humbled by the blessings she continues to deliver. I don't deserve a daughter so lovely, so kind, so beautiful and patient, so full of faith and conviction. Yet God's merciful love is lavish...incomprehensible, and dare I say CRAZY?! (Pope Benedict did.)

Acne- Men go through puberty, sprout hair in weird places, and develop a deeper voice. Some, may have a brief phase of a year or 2, where their skin is trying to figure out what the hell is happening. Awesome, congratulations men. Women, nope, we get to break out like we are 15 years old again, every month. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
So, where does that leave us?
11. In fact, the opposite is true. A lot of people like Ron Paul because of what he says about racism: that it’s an ugly form of collectivism, that we don’t get our rights as groups but as individuals and everyone should be treated the same way.

Previously God had worked salvation for mankind through the Jews and is still true even in the case of Jesus as Jesus was a Jew. The purpose of God was always to bring salvation to people. Previously the Jewish nation of Israel were a witness to God’s great glory. When God performed great miracles in Egypt the Egyptian leaders should have submitted to the will of God and acknowledged him as Supreme and got rid of their gods, but rather they opposed Moses his mediator. A small portion of Egyptians did follow him. Consider the story of Ruth a Moabite – an enemy of the Jews yet through her faith was accepted into teh household of God. One day through her line would be born Jesus. Gentiles were always welcome to be saved but lacked privileges in the temple services. Under Christ (also a Jew) we come to God and have equal share in temple services with the Jews, but no longer in a physical temple but as a living temple of God.
A legion mate invited me to play with them in a PvPvE (Player vs Player vs Envirnoment) arena we call Dredgion. I play a healer in this online game so naturally, I am responsible for keeping my 5 group mates alive including removing physical and mental conditions but, I also do fair amount of damage.I was disoriented with my keys and controls again. Since it’s also a PvP instance, we also have to battle other players – so its more like a 6 vs 6 including the the NPCs.
To begin with, the Editors’ Guild could commit itself to carrying out an annual census of newsroom diversity of the kind that the American Society of News Editors (ASNE) began in 1978. In that year, “people of colour” were 4 per cent of people in U.S. newsrooms, though they were close to 30 per cent of the American population. The target was to reach more than 20 per cent by 2000. They missed the target. In 2011, “minorities” were about 13 per cent of American newsrooms, though they constituted 36 per cent of the U.S. population. (That includes African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans and Asians). The new ASNE target date has been set to 2020.
If European skin had whitened through selection for lighter-skinned women, it should have whitened more in women than in men, thus becoming more sexually dimorphic. Yet skin color actually seems to be less dimorphic in Europeans than in other humans (Madrigal & Kelly, 2006). This finding does not necessarily invalidate the sexual selection hypothesis. It may be that the pigmentary sex difference cannot fully express itself in light-skinned populations. Skin color is dimorphic because girls progressively lighten in color during adolescence, and such lightening may be less easily expressed if melanin production is already low. Indeed, this dimorphism seems to be almost absent in people whose skin starts off with very little pigment, such as Dutch and Belgian subjects (Frost, 2007).
We must restore our town and city centres and historical buildings to the way they were before councillors and developers began destroying them.
Another great thing about the book is its illustrations. Janet Ahlberg’s nostalgic depiction of a messy but happy household with three kids (the baby is the youngest of the lot) is done with soft edges and in a wide variety of colours. Allan Ahlberg’s (yes, they are married, although Janet Ahlberg passed away in 1994) use of simple words are a good complement this, as toddlers can take the book one step further and match the words to items in the picture.
I can (and have) spent entire weekends devoted only to watching one particular show, with just a few breaks in between for bathroom breaks and to stock up on food and very minimal sleep. Zero human contact. Sometimes I screw myself over with this habit, like last year when I decided to watch three seasons of The Office the weekend before my final business paper was due. I eventually managed to cram and get my work done, so I’d say it was worth it.

Between the time of my last post in Part 2 of this series and this one, we made a trip to India. I remember our last trip to India in 2010 when Advik was just 2 years old. He couldn’t speak any language at that time. Some of the suggestions mentioned at the beginning of Part 1 came from well-meaning relatives back in India during that trip. One of my cousins told the horror-story of a boy who was not speaking even at 4 years of age and his parents had to quit their jobs in the USA and return to India for his treatment. Listening to all such stories, any desi parent in US would despair. But this year’s India trip was vastly different. It was great seeing my son take part in and enjoy all the activities in and around family, friends and relatives; he could really interact well with kids his age. My relatives, on their part, were amazed to see him speaking in their languages and following everything that was going on.

A couple years ago, I read "The Pillars of the Earth" by Ken Follett. It was 900 pages +/- and I found it very interesting. After all, I was a history major in college, donated my collection of over 50 books on Russian history to the local Junior College, and I read history books like a lot of people read novels. I have been fascinated by the building of about 13 gigantic, beautiful, still-standing cathedrals in Great Britain in a span of 200 years. I had the honor of visiting the Cathedral at Wells the last time I was in England. The book was great.

Much of Sheldon’s book is about Henry Maxwell, pastor of the First Church of Raymond; and early on, Sheldon quotes the preacher as follows:
Yesterday I made a post about how there may be infinite universes out there where every single possibility is fulfilled in that universe, and I also said that it not only talks about sub-atomic things like nuclear radiation of particles or whether or not the cat dies, but it most likely also relates to everyday things, like tossing coins.
But, the best thing I found out was that I had 165 people attend my Virtual Book Launch last September. This made me very happy. I am hoping to have another virtual book launch very soon, as I have a few books coming out this year.

At the water surface, resistance is proportional to the breadth of a boat. Lying flat on the chest in freestyle or on the back in backstroke exposes the breadth of the body to the water. Rolling on the side reduces the breadth and the resistance. In freestyle and backstroke, one should roll from one side to the other in the stroke and glide on the side as much as possible. When taking breaths, one should take them as little as possible; for beginners it is good to breathe every three strokes and the more trained you are the more strokes in between each breath.
So this is where we get into trouble. One thing that all of these “P” words have in common is the fact that they are not achievable by human beings. The idea that we will always do everything right is a false belief and as the beloved Apostle of Love, John put it, “we deceive ourselves.” (See 1 John 1 and 2)

Some scholars argue the main settlement of the archipelago occurred 12,000 to 30,000 years ago, and that modern Japanese -- both the language and the people -- descend directly from this stone-age culture, which had some agriculture but was based mainly on hunting and gathering.

I held him and I prayed out loud over him while he cried. I asked Jesus to take those scary thoughts from his mind and He did! Gabey’s crying stopped, not gradually like usual, but abruptly. Jesus showed my little guy that He is always near and that he hears our prayers. For a while Gabey flattened his small body right onto mine. He wanted every inch of his body to feel safe and he came to me for that. I am so thankful for these moments, these moments where I realize my children have a safer, more stable childhood than I did.

The clean up continues this week as I prepare my house for sale. Yesterday I spent much of the day pulling all of the stuff out of the garage, sweeping out an amazing amount of spiders with eggs and webs (I have a slight arachnophobia – not fun) , and then putting all the stuff back in. What stuck me in the process is how much I love manual labor. Not that I could make it my life’s work, but I really enjoy seeing a finished project. Whether painting, building a wall, digging a garden, or any project, I can see the progress and I can see the completion. The same thing happens when I write. But what’s the marker or end game in personal development? How do we know we are making progress?
Oh well, we see dead birds all the time on our dinner plates; what are a few million more when we have the California Delta Smelt to worry about? Now there’s a success; we’ve shut down 600,000 acres of prime San Joaquin Valley agricultural land, idled thousands of farm workers and the ungrateful smelt go on about as before without a thought for the sacrifice we so bravely used the government to force farmers and their workers to make.

I'm not taking any grad classes this semester, in hopes of focusing on wedding planning. We've been so laid back about the plans (minus one minor cry about the bridesmaid dresses...story to come later) that I'm a smidgen nervous that we're going to go into full-on freak out mode sometime soon.
Still working on convincing the Hubby we should redo our room. We have yet to ever get new furniture for it and our current bed is one my Hubby got in college, but we've been using the old guest bed lately. We were wanting to upgrade to a king size bed but I think our room is a little too small for one. Our bedding was what we registered for when we got married. I like it, but our dogs have ruined the embroidery that covers it. Plus it's polyester, so it doesn't breathe well. Come summer time in Texas, that sucker is hot! So I've switched to a white duvet with a tan coverlet.
I won't complain or whine about things that make it hard because we all have them but shit just ain't easy sometimes and I won't get into it more than that as focusing on the negative never helped anyone. Instead I chose to focus my energy on a couple things that are possible causes for an issue and I have seemingly come up with a solution as I am again able to stay focused and the weight is coming down again but then again when someone walks a few miles per day and then rides a few more it tends to help in that department so who knows.

Humans occasionally ask me whether gay gorillas exist. I tell them the percentages are similar to the human population. The main difference is that no male gorilla, to my knowledge, has ever willingly taken it up the butt. Gorillas in all-male pairings always play the active role in relationships with smaller apes. A gorilla of this disposition lives in our neighbourhood – his name is Passion Fruit and he’s involved with a male chimpanzee. The two are pretty much inseparable, so it was quite a surprise when Passion Fruit turned up unaccompanied to the Annual Simian Convention.

This is a form of talk which pays a large but, I would think, relatively harmless role in our personal lives. But with the development of the mass media, inanity has suddenly emerged as a major form of language in public matters. The invention of new and various kinds of communication has given a voice and an audience to many people whose opinions would otherwise not be solicited, and who, in fact, have little else but verbal excrement to contribute to public issues. Many of these people are entertainers. The press and air waves are filled with the featured and prime-time statements from people who are in no position to render informed judgments on what they are talking about and yet render them with elan and, above all, sincerity. Inanity, then, is ignorance presented in the cloak of sincerity.

Heat a frying pan, pour in the oil and ghee. When very hot, add the onions and green chillies together and fry till they turn limp. Add the drumstick leaves. Sprinkle a handful of water and ½ teaspoon salt over the drumstick leaves, cover with a lid, and let the drumstick leaves boil for 5 minutes over moderate heat. Meanwhile, beat up the eggs with the turmeric powder and ½ teaspoon salt. Remove the covering lid over the drumstick leaves and fry turning over frequently. When dryish and no water runs out, pour the egg batter slowly all over the drumstick leaves, stirring with a spatula to distribute the egg batter evenly. When the egg sets into flakes, remove from the fire. Serve hot as soon as it is made for a delicious flavor. Enjoy!

Books are mere reflections of us, no matter what genre or what year they were written or what divinity they supposedly hold. Someone has observed something at some point that made them think, “Now why on Earth would you do that?” or “Gee, this will make for a holler!” Indeed, you’re probably thinking to yourself as you read this why I’m writing about observing other people writing about observing other people while your observing through the writing what sort of person I am.

One of the worst things about bigotry is the fact that people are prejudiced against something that many times the other person can’t help. I don’t know many gay people who were overjoyed when they realized they were gay. I don’t know many people of color who haven’t lamented, at least once, the fact that they weren’t born something else. No one ever wants to be different, but they can’t always help it. And it doesn’t help to be hated for what you can’t change.
In reference to Dr. Muhlen's remarks on the efforts of certain publishers to apply self-censorship (and which he criticizes with considerable pessimism and sarcasm), let me point out that we, as one of the oldest and largest publishers in the comics magazine field, are heartily in accord with the movement to scrutinize comics. We are definitely opposed to those elements in the industry (even though they constitute a distinct minority) which publish tasteless comics. We at National Comics have been aware of our responsibility—long before there was any practical need to control, apologize, or defend. Our code has guaranteed outstanding comics reading matter from the point of view of story content, of legibility, and of good taste.

For me, i’m very lucky to feel pretty okay about my body image. I work out a lot and have a clean diet, so feel I do the best I can with what i’ve got. Yet when I was reading the first bit of the newsletter, stating all the reasons women may have body image issues, I started feeling like ‘oh, maybe I have body image issues too’. Even though prior to reading this I was feeling good and kick ass in my work-out gear. I was empathising with all the reasons why women (including myself) may have issues, that a teeny part of me wondered if i did indeed have some doubts that need work.

3) An adorable note to send home to parents for star student: The First Grade Parade calls it the "Celebrity of the Week" (to go with her movie theme) but she used to have a jungle theme (like I currently do) and she called it "King/Queen of the Jungle", so that's what I did!
Greece is the canary in the coal mine for the EU, UK, and the US. Every austerity measure proposed by the Greek government is swiftly met with demonstrations and in many cases riots.
See... I have my first ever book release June 5th of this year. And on the SAME day, my friend and mentor, Elizabeth Spann Craig is releasing the first in a new series of hers... Both Cozy Mysteries... both tons of fun! So we thought we'd share the fun with you.
Also, fried catfish. It's something that my dad excelled at creating, and I miss his version like crazy.
I love The Music Tapes. Period. Seeing them live and interviewing them was pretty much how this blog came to be. Their records spin endlessly in my room, and their performance as part of the Elephant 6 Holiday Surprise Tour was one of my musical high points of the year. They are wonderful, and the only thing I wished from the band was that they would release more music, seeing as they have only released two albums in eleven years.
I tried to call Cynthia, but couldn’t make the connection. I took the elevator to the lobby, where Hugh was waiting. I thought he knew. He didn’t. I had to break the news to him.

Players commit themselves to their teammates and to their teams. It’s what they love about their teammates, and what their teammates love about them. It’s what the fans love about them too. If these players are asked to do more, they will do more. Yet something keeps them from committing to what they shouldn’t commit. In the 1980s, if opponents of the Edmonton Oilers had truly done everything to win the Cup, they would’ve gone after Wayne Gretzky’s head. It wasn’t Gretzky’s enforcer teammate, Dave Semenko, who stopped them, nor the referees nor the league officials and the suspensions they would have levied. The players wouldn’t do it. Some basic humanity, some basic belief in the essence of a game holds us back.
Since we’re being so personal let’s go ahead and address the elephant in the room. I haven’t posted in a little while because I’m a lazy bum. Don’t feel bad though. I’ve neglected everything else as well. It wasn’t until today and yesterday that I finally caught up in grading homework from about three weeks ago.

Two years later, the Pentagon review is still continuing, which prompted Congress to ask the GAO to look over the Pentagon’s shoulder. What they found lacked military precision.

In fact the Off Broadway theaters in Hell’s Kitchen soon became an incubator for some of the leading American playwrights and actors and actresses in a way that Broadway in this period was not. Wendy Wasserstein, for example, was writing about real problems of contemporary New York women that weren’t being shown on Broadway (until her plays moved there). In a sense, these Off Broadway productions and theaters on theater row would influence and pull up the quality of productions on Broadway and help to revive the Broadway theater, which many feared was dying. Although when Playwright’s Horizons opened on 42nd Street it was not unusual for couples on their way to attend a performance to be accosted by prostitutes offering to show the man a better time than his wife/date could, over time the block on 42nd Street between 8th and 10th Avenue improved so that it was demonstrably better than the block between 7th and 8th. Even at the beginning however, it became clear that if the theaters on theater row could offer quality entertainment with actresses like Glenn Close in plays by a writer like Wendy Wasserstein people would come over to 9th Avenue.

I'm not sure how it got to be the last weekend we will spend here. I still have so many things I want to do. I didn't get to finish much on my bucket list. I guess I had some high hopes there. Our last weekend was spent holding a garage sale, napping for 3 hours, and eating out at Houlihans. And today, staying lazily out the front windows in my living room. Hey they are open though, it's beautiful outside. And to think I will be leaving the sunny 70s for the snowy 30s. Who's idea was this moving North anyway??
I’m pretty sure that the reason we, as a people, all suddenly decided to stop saying WWW in front of websites in the 2000’s was solely due to everyone wanting to distance themselves as far away from the fart for brains, bumbling sock puppet, prezzy we had in the White House as humanly possible. Is it just me or did everyone else get a nice clean peak at the sheer stupidiocity of the inner gears of our government when the republican party put forth an old bobble head of the first George Bush? The Texas version of Dudley Moore’s ‘Arthur’ comes from a family monarchy, can barely coagulate two words together to make a sentence that doesn’t embarrass us all as a nation, becomes president and I’m expected to believe we have a fair and legal voting system?

Francatelli brought his French training to the Queen’s table (by the way, the print at left is of the kitchen at Windsor Castle), walking a fine balance between the new haute cuisine and traditional English tastes: though his menus for the Queen introduced the lighter, more delicate cooking he learned in France, there was always a roast beef or a roast saddle of mutton or haunch of venison prepared and waiting on the sideboard for any who wanted it. Unfortunately, his employment with the Queen only lasted two years; some have speculated that the young Queen’s new husband, Prince Albert, did not care for his wife’s chef (pointing out that in Francatelli’s books there are numerous recipes called after the Queen, but only one after Prince Albert—for a highly pungent sauce containing a great deal of horseradish!)

Oh my goodness, guys. I think I totally beat the cheeseburger recipe in terms of Most Delicious Burgers Ever. Also, these were much simpler, which makes it even BETTER. I've been following the blog Stonesoup for a while now, since I decided to learn to make sourdough and found a recipe on Jules' site (for the record, it was incredible, I just never got a good enough photo to post the recipe; if you are interested you can find it here. Also I understand that I have only been posting phone pictures lately which makes that reasoning invalid). The recipes are delightfully simple, and most contain less than 5 ingredients which is so great. The bonus with these burgers is that most of the ingredients I would generally have on hand anyway! Except bread. I've only just started keeping a loaf of bread in the freezer, I don't eat enough to warrant always having a fresh loaf in the house, let alone rolls! (Honestly, though, I live within walking distance of at least three shops so its no big deal to run out and get some, which means this recipe is a-ok with me)
For me, this is interesting and helps me reflect on the methodological paradigm in which I am working. What will my research methods reveal about the context in which I operate? Can I find a way of reflecting on this when discussing my methodology? Can I make it part of the research rather than secondary to the data collected from interviewees.

Nature speaks to us of a God of love and beauty, but also of justice. Wrongs must be righted, and wickedness that holds back the truth has to be dealt with.
For almost two years now, Kiera's boyfriend, Denny, has been everything she's ever wanted: loving, tender and endlessly devoted to her. When they head off to a new city to start their lives together, Denny at his dream job and Kiera at a top-notch university, everything seems perfect. Then an unforeseen obligation forces the happy couple apart.
A few minor fit issues remain. The back still shows a bit of swayback bubble, which I might actually have to remove with a horizontal tuck to get rid of. The front princess seams actually fall to the inside of my nipples, which makes me want to move them over a bit (given that I seem to have slight to not-so-slight gaping in the front, maybe I should just widen the centre front piece). I’d still like to make a couple more of these, I think, one in black (either linen or a cotton eyelet) and one in a white cotton that I could actually wear without the fancy shirt underneath. At some point I want to draft a long sleeve, and play with the design now that I have a nice, (almost) perfectly fitting princess bodice.
Let me begin this post by first showing you a couple of passages of Scripture that I believe fit very well together. First, from the Gospels; second, from Paul; third, from the book of Hebrews. Notice how all three passages speak to the the same ideas, peace, reconciliation, oneness.
i’d venture to say that i just don’t like to ‘deal’ with silly issues, and if i think it’s a nonsense issue, or the other person is never going to see my side, no matter what, i feel there’s no urgency in dealing with the situation and rather just blow it off .. i pretty much operate with the ‘i’m over it’ attitude everyday .. there’s always something that i just rather do my thing then to deal with silliness .. can anyone else feel me on this?!

cries the railway company, like the witches in Macbeth, and thus a score or so of fair visions appear and vanish daily before the distracted eyes of the employé. It must be a singular fate, I say, to stand empannelled in that ugly room, looking out upon mankind from a pigeonhole. Altogether, I think I should prefer being the hermit at Cremorne. When he has issued a certain number of acrostics, and collected a proportionate quantity of sixpences, he may shut up the Book of Fate, lay aside his beard and magic robes, and mingle freely in the mazy dance; but here, voe misero! one train succeeds another - every minute fresh passengers arrive - more tickets are wanted - the same demands are made all day - ' first class,' 'second class,' 'third class' - , 'sixpence,' 'fourpence ' 'twopence' - single fare, return fare - ordinary and express trains - click, click, click everlastingly. The gentleman who worked the Delphic oracle in the height of the season must have had an easy lot compared with this.

The extremely close second-place beer is Double Mountain's IRA ("Ira," forever and always, to me), a beer that has every quality an enlightening beer should have: it is in perfect harmony, is instantly striking to the drinker, and is original in design and implementation. I wrote of it in August:
Andersen’s bias is actually quite refreshing – this is HIS vision of how cinema deals with Los Angeles (don’t call it “L.A.”!), and as he moves through his topics – the city as backdrop, character, subject, and so many more – he treats the city and the movies with care, if not always with praise.

It does take a while to cook. Be sure to read through the recipe- a total of about an hour and 20 minutes. When my sauce had about 20 minutes to go, I put the meatballs in the oven and started to boil the water for my spaghetti. Also, be sure to keep the heat on low while it's simmering, or you'll have a pretty messy red splattered kitchen... I speak from experience. :)

There is no “under-representation” in the NBA either. Science and basketball are the only two remaining areas of American life not kneecapped yet by the race maniacs. All that counts is how high you can jump. But that is apparently going to change, with NASA killing off the Constellation rocket program so that it can sprinkle funding onto global affirmative legerdemain, whether of the “Muslim science” kind or the “Minority Research” kind.
The sun was still bright and the sky clear and blue so started all over again.

Phat then takes Jonah to his room for the night. Mei Ling is there and as Phat & the guard leave, the guard gives Jonah one more bust to the chops with a rifle butt. Mei Ling runs to Jonah's side. Jonah asks Ling how she got mixed up all of this and she explains that she had received a telegram stating that Jonah was in danger. When she went to the place appointed in the telegram, she was abducted.
