* The team that dropped a lot in my rankings with a win was Michigan State. I had the Spartans higher than any voter a week ago, at No. 9.

Michigan State led only 14-6 at the half and in many ways didn't look as good as the teams above the Spartans.

People tend to turn first to medical providers when hunting for prices. In a recent California HealthCare Foundation survey of 1,528 consumers, 26% said they had looked for information on the cost of a medical procedure in advance. Thirty-nine percent of those surveyed said they contacted a healthcare provider, 30% looked online and 8% turned to their insurance company, according to the foundation.

It's a hefty tab. Cumulatively, charges associated with Northern California million-dollar hospital stays in 2010 came to $5.2 billion. That's 7 percent of all hospital charges from two-tenths of one percent of all hospital patients.
"I am trying to get back, but it's impossible, they've tightened the siege even more. Not even an ant can go in or out today," he said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
U.S. cybersecurity experts acknowledge that attribution can be difficult, and that while they can trace an attack to China, it is often difficult to track directly to the Chinese government. Last December’s report by U.S. intelligence agencies said America must openly confront China and Russia in a broad diplomatic push to combat cyberattacks that are on the rise and represent a "persistent threat to U.S. economic security."
James Allen Misener, 77, of North Olmsted, died Jan. 30.
The new EPA study will look at the entire water lifecycle of hydraulic fracturing in shale deposits, beginning with the industry's withdrawal of huge volumes of water from rivers and streams and ending with the treatment and disposal of the tainted wastewater that comes back out of the wells after fracking.

Earlier this year, Obama reversed his long-standing opposition to outside political groups and gave his blessing to an independent "super PAC" backing his reelection. He was responding to unfettered spending in the GOP presidential primaries, made possible by a series of court rulings in 2010 that allowed massive donations by billionaires and corporations to super PACS.
Sure, the "Brokeback" punning has gone stale, and some of the "homo on the range" gay-cowboy jokes were never funny to begin with. What's been remarkable, though, is the lack of malice -- most "Brokeback" humor has skewed toward playful rather than homophobic, with pranksters leaving the film alone while satirizing its truly horrendous theatrical trailer. It's hard not to mock mawkishness. Witness Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger's inability to keep a straight face while reading a florid description of their movie during last month's Screen Actors Guild awards.
Others agreed that Westlund was, in many ways, a larger-than-life character. Born in California to a wealthy family, he moved to Oregon as a teenager. He was part of two successful business ventures -- a mining operation that produced "Kitty Diggins" cat litter and another business that sells bull semen to cattle breeders.
But James controlled the game, especially late as Miami needed a 31-19 fourth quarter to win its regular-season home finale. The Heat played without starters Dwyane Wade (dislocated left index finger), Chris Bosh (leg muscle fatigue) and Mario Chalmers (flulike symptoms). Backup center Ronny Turiaf missed his seventh straight game while recovering from a hamstring problem.

The federal government began the bailout of savings-and-loan institutions, which through deregulation and bad real-estate loans began to fail in the mid-1980s. One of the largest thrifts to fail was Lincoln Savings, a major element of Valley resident Charles H Keating Jr.'s empire. Another was Western Savings, Phoenix base of the Driggs family, which was prominent in politics and business.

"Smash" (10 p.m. Monday, Feb. 20, WKYC Channel 3): Now that Ivy (Megan Hilty) has the role of Marilyn Monroe, the spotlight shifts to the search for an actor to play Joe DiMaggio. Also in this third episode of the slick musical drama, Karen (Katharine McPhee) returns to her hometown for a friend's baby shower.
Negatives? Well, Metro apps and the Start screen work extremely well on tablets, small notebooks, and big TVs. But Metro could probably stand some tweaks to take full advantage of desktop-sized screens. There's certainly enough pixels in a 20-inch or 24-inch display to allow two apps to run in portrait-style mode side by side without overlapping.
"We continue to monitor the developments related to Roberto's return to the United States and remain in touch with his representatives," said Indians GM Chris Antonetti. "We are not able to elaborate beyond that at this point."

For the past several years, former Cardinals first-base coach Dave McKay had said when manager Tony La Russa retired he would, too. Then La Russa retired in October. And McKay realized he didn't want to walk away just yet.
If you're the Trail Blazers owner, you have to have this guy. Not just because he's won a lot of basketball games. But because when you get Calipari, you also get basketball power broker William Wesley. If Portland really plans to be a serious player in free agency this summer, changing Calipari's mind, and outbidding the other suitors for this duo would be the most dynamic move in Allen's 24-year history as Blazers owner.
Each repeated as No. 1 in their size categories for the St. Petersburg Times' Top 70 Workplaces honors. New York Life is tops among large businesses; ASI, No. 1 among medium-sized companies; and St. Mary's, head of the class for smaller companies.

“It’s all fed by emotion. When we play inconsistent, we get frustrated easily with ourselves. When we play with the right emotion, we play solid volleyball. Everything is there.”
While Portland paid a relatively low price for an All-Star level player, the deal did cost the Blazers a fan favorite in Przybilla. A rough-neck, blue-collar Midwesterner, Przybilla, 31, was the longest tenured Blazers player and perhaps their toughest. He blocked shots, set textbook screens, and stood up for himself and his teammates if an opponent dared to even look at him too long.
America had 33,000 traffic deaths last year - nearly the equivalent of a 9/11 disaster every month. A new AAA study concluded that car crashes cost the U.S. $300 billion each year.
Leonard's move comes a few weeks after KATU reported on illegal structures on downtown food cart lots and as Portland's quirky food cart scene continues to attract national media attention.

Kasdan earned a master's degree in education from the University of Michigan and wrote ad copy before his breakthrough, but making movies "is the only thing I've ever wanted to do. It's total fun, and you're surrounded by people who have spent their whole career learning how to pull cable and set a light, do makeup, hair or act. What could be more fun than to be surrounded by that in difficult circumstances?"
Pomerantz's talent projects him as a top-of-rotation starter. There's no guarantee that's how it goes for him. If it does, that's still a notch below Jimenez's 2010 season, in which the right-hander started for the NL in the All-Star Game and finished third in the Cy Young balloting.
“Derek was an amazing father, an amazing husband, and an amazing best friend,” said the soldier’s widow, Mechele Nikole Kerns, having arrived in Woodstown from her home in Holly Ridge, N.C., where Cpl. Kerns was stationed.

Janice Buckingham may not have a permanent place to call home yet, but she's awfully grateful to have a bed to sleep in at last.
Every dish, while somewhat familiar, has an ingredient or technique that elevated it from the ordinary and made me want to order it. That's the reason I didn't order the bone marrow: I couldn't resist the Dungeness crab tacos ($12) - three crisp shells that hold snow-white crab mixed with tiny dices of watermelon and mint, an unlikely but thoroughly refreshing combination.
Back at police headquarters, Hank is questioning Old Man Geiger, in an interrogation room with as many dark, rich shadows as a late-period Rembrandt. Next door, Nick is questioning Roddy in a dark-paneled room with a window, casting a bit of Vermeer light. Who knew Portland police worked in such artful digs?

Gen. David Petraeus, the top U.S. and NATO commander in Kabul, took the rare step of a military leader taking a position on a domestic matter when he warned in an e-mail to The Associated Press that "images of the burning of a Koran would undoubtedly be used by extremists in Afghanistan -- and around the world -- to inflame public opinion and incite violence."
In a call to The Associated Press today, Chen said friends who have tried to visit have been beaten up.

Although the FDA is legally barred from considering cost when reviewing drugs, health care providers have raised concerns about Truvada's price tag: $900 a month, or just under $11,000 per year. Medicare and Medicaid, the nation's largest health insurance plans, generally cover drugs approved by the FDA, and analysts expect most large health insurers to follow suit.

'--My connection to Cleveland is slight but deeply felt. Here it is:
"We have a lot of young guys that need experience to guide them," Bartell said. "He can put together a quality coaching staff to develop players like Rodger Saffold, Jason Smith, Bradley Fletcher: Just being able to have guys who have been around the league and have experience and have been through these battles and know how to win will help the players."
LIAO YIWU: The writer and former political prisoner fled to Germany last July after a secretive journey with stops in Vietnam and Poland. Authorities had been especially harsh on his previous efforts to leave China for literary festivals and other events, blocking him from traveling overseas more than a dozen times. Before he fled, he said police had warned him several times that if he published anything overseas again, he would be jailed. He is known for "The Corpse Walker," a published series of interviews with people on the margins of China's society.
“The first 3 or 4 minutes of the game, we didn’t follow our defensive game plan,” Scott said. “Guys didn’t have any focus on what we were doing, and it trickled down from one guy to the last guy, and we got exactly what we deserved.”
Cho said that he would be making moves. I can't see moving Camby or Miller right now, so that leaves Pryzbilla and someone else to use as trade bait. Any ideas Chad, cause us Blazer fans are waiting for good news rather then the injury news that seems to be all we get. Oh also LMA snubbed for All-Star, any comments about that?
We see some of this playing out on the national scene right now. President Barack Obama is enjoying a resurgence in the polls, but this has little to do with anything the White House has done. Rather, it's being driven by 1) signs of life in the economy, and 2) the GOP veering right and making the president appear more moderate in comparison. This can work for the president — if both factors remain. The rising price of oil may derail rising optimism, and if the GOP soon settles on Mitt Romney, the intra-party battle driving the rightward shift will end and Mr. Romney will have time to reposition himself. So the president must remain committed to keeping moderate Democrats in the fold.
Leading the nation in punting average last season, recently departed All-America punter Shawn Powell left big shoes to fill.

Splash some color on big rocks, plant them on a hill, call it art and you really set yourself up for the "My-kid-could-do-that" reaction.
Your veterinarian is well informed, and I would follow his advice. He needs to take blood samples to monitor Simba's condition and determine if and when the levels of medication need to be adjusted. With careful monitoring, blood tests and general checkups, your dog should enjoy a good quality of life with minimal, if any, harmful side effects from these medications. They will help stop further degenerative changes in your dog's heart - but not reverse them - and help maintain normal heart function and circulation.
One of the nation's largest medical debt-collection firms, Accretive came to Swanson's attention last summer, when an employee lost a laptop computer containing personal data on thousands of Fairview patients. Swanson later sued the company, alleging it failed to protect the confidentiality of patient records or tell patients about its role in managing the revenue and care delivery at two local hospital systems.

Both women were hospitalized in California. Dacko has undergone several surgeries and remains injured, the claim said.
Following a three-hour meeting at City Hall on Thursday with the team's owners, the Maloofs, the mayor announced the group will reconvene early today for another round of talks.
Accretive Health Inc., the same company that came under fire last week with Fairview Health Systems for aggressive patient debt collection practices, said Swanson's lawsuit over the lost laptop should be thrown out because no consumers have been harmed and the suit's consumer fraud claims are baseless.

øOur staff: No one can do it all alone, and as such every small business should be incredibly grateful for having people around who buy into the plan and help carry it out. Whether it's a part-time virtual assistant or a staff of 50, employees make it all possible. We are thankful that you help us so, we are thankful that we can afford to keep you on, and I bet most of wish we could do more for you.
She continued: The inescapable conclusion of such a tactic is that the government recognizes that its proofs at trial failed to establish the plan described in the indictment, so it is attempting to formulate an alternative theory of criminal liability 
"Today's incident will not bring closure to that investigation," he said.
And off he went with the answers to my questions.
--C David Baas’ mysterious neck ailment will remain just that for now. Coughlin didn’t shed any light on Baas’ issue but said he hoped the fact the headaches aren’t listed on the injury report anymore is a good sign. “I think he’s making progress, I do,” Coughlin said. Asked if the Giants would keep Baas on the sideline when he’s healthy so as not to disrupt what the offensive line has done in his absence, Coughlin said, “What we want to do is let’s get them all back so we can (practice). He hasn’t practiced in a couple of weeks. We need to get him back on the practice field and back in the groove and then we’ll make those kinds of calls.”
O'Keefe also pleaded guilty last May after he was accused of trying to tamper with the phones in Sen. Mary Landrieu's office.

For starters, if injuries and bye weeks are causing you roster problems in the weeks ahead, look first at the 49ers' schedule for replacements. Tampa Bay is up next, so QB Chris Simms automatically vaults from afterthought to starting caliber.

"There's a lot of skill that's involved in that, and for these students to get exposed to it in the program, that's a great chance to test it out," he said. "Bryce is very good. He's focused on what he wants to do and be in life, and he's like a sponge: He'll absorb stuff and loves information."

Paranoid? The Chiefs have adamantly denied that they tap phones or listen in on conversations. But as the team enters another period of transition after elevating defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel last week to head coach, interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees suggest that intimidation and secrecy are among the Chiefs' principal management styles  and that Haley wasn't the only one with paranoid thoughts.
Bishop Manuel Cruz of the Archdiocese of Newark has seen both sides of Landolfi. The two men met decades ago, when Landolfi was a young resident at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston.

The plan was to go with wide receiver Marquis Burrell. But late in the summer, coach Howard Langley found out Camilo had transferred into Clinton. He simply told his players he had a surprise for them. And what a surprise it has been.
Rockland was more often the heretic and Gillespie the devout follower, but the two outsiders with different upbringings — Rockland from a New York liberal background and Gillespie from a southern conservative one — teamed up to tell the inside story of the function-over-form "McDonald’s of American roads."
DePaul University in Chicago took Nelligan to court over similar allegations in 2002. In that case, DePaul charged that Nelligan failed to report or account for revenues received, misappropriated tickets, failed to pay expenses and did not pay the university its share of new revenues. That case was also settled. Both universities have since severed ties with Nelligan.
Jessica Chastain: As with Williams, the elaborate gold-and-black detail of Chastain's Alexander McQueen gown would have looked heavy, like ornate upholstery fabric, on another woman. But Chastain's youth and coloring made her the perfect person to wear it.

Although Buchanan would not reveal the team's final decisions, the Blazers are expected to make the qualifying offer to Oden and pick up the options on the three rookie contracts.

It's tough to argue about the need. An alarming number of high school students -- about 1 million nationally -- drop out of school before graduation. More than 40 percent of New York state's community college students are so poorly prepared that they need first-year remedial help -- a not unusual pattern. Across the nation, high proportions of college students fail to complete their studies and win degrees. Each dropout or failure not only spells limited life prospects for the student, but a less economically vibrant region where they live.
But Kline said that "I have serious concerns about any proposal that simply kicks the can down the road and creates more uncertainty in the long run -- which is what put us in this situation in the first place."
"This editorial contradicts itself. First it states that buying insurance is a matter of individual responsibility. Then it states that the law prevents insurance companies from charging people different rates depending on their medical risk.

At the same time, the campus now houses three autonomous small schools, each with different programs.

But Dickinson has created subtle variations on the story that bring the characters and situations into fresh focus. Micaela, sweet and virginal in the opera, here is hot-blooded and compassionate. Don Jose is a mad Hispanic hatter from the get-go, and he goes completely over the edge – even becoming a druggie – when Carmen dumps him for Escamillo.
Mond thinks John is being absurd, but think about all the ways people go out of their way to make themselves miserable. They run marathons. They climb Everest. They leave cushy jobs to launch risky start-ups. Paradoxically, wealth and security create more and more yearning for extreme conditions. You didn’t see 20,000 people lining up to run marathons in the Great Depression. Life itself was sufficiently difficult.

His job is one of many in Cognac, the region, that is as intertwined as grape vines with the traditions of Cognac, the drink.

Blais didn't just cook a great meal, Taute notes. He ran a great restaurant, which no doubt gave him the extra nudge.

She even had posted photos online of work in progress. To see that float come down the street, with everyone cheering it, was really great.
Reds are often dark, with purple hues, but there are light ones as well. The intensity of the color ranges from a light cherry that's completely transparent to a deep red that's opaque. The darker wines tend to be made from the big grapes grown in warm climates with full ripeness such as Malbec, Syrah, Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel and Merlot. The lighter wines are produced with grapes such as pure Pinot noir and some Gamays. When reds are young, they tend to have a purple hue on the rim. As they age, they move to a brick color and eventually to amber. So both reds and whites, when aged to the extreme, become amber.

What pushed Mr. Santorum to the front in the most recent contests — and vaulted him into a tie with Mr. Romney in at least one national poll — was his ability to stay above the bickering and negativity that took place between Mr. Romney and Newt Gingrich. Mr. Santorum is not as susceptible to personal attacks, as he seems to have a clean personal life, as far as we know. This means to attack Mr. Santorum, one must attack his policy positions. This cannot be done in the GOP nomination process because to attack Mr. Santorum's policy positions would be to attack the Republican platform.

During Alex Rodriguez's presser with media here yesterday, Wright's name came up twice. First, when it was mentioned he would inherit Team USA's starting third base job from Rodriguez because the New York Yankees third base shifted his national team from the USA in 2006 WBC to Dominican Republic for this year's. And then when Rodriguez offered Wright up as the only current player he'd name who sent a text message of support in the past couple weeks.

Wendy McKenna, who holds a doctorate in psychology and is on the gender studies faculty at Purchase College, SUNY, agrees. "I have no idea what's going on with Shiloh or her parents," says McKenna, who also is a member of the psychology and women's studies faculty at Barnard College and has a private psychology practice in Westchester.

Perzel asked if Beckman sometimes had her sign papers she didn't understand.
I intend no blanket lionization here of Rep. Waters, who is the object of a protracted ethics probe and whom I have for years privately dubbed "Mad Max," in both consternation and admiration of her feistiness. Moreover, as hypocritical and self-serving as the Tea Party Patriots' statement is, it is also correct: Telling people to go to hell is about as uncivil as it gets. I could never, in ordinary times, applaud such conduct.
The table is broken into 27 columns, each representing six lunar months. Each column is topped by the face of one of three moon gods -- a jaguar, a skull and a woman. These three repeat. So by consulting the table, a priest, say, could tell which moon god would preside over a particular date.

"After school, we'd be singing on the street," said Norman Thrasher, who began his singing career with the Serenaders when they were all in seventh and eighth grade. "We'd sing slow songs all through the week, and on Sundays we'd find a preacher on the street and sing gospel. We'd be on one side of the street, and the Four Tops would be singing on the other side."
That's a glimpse into the private life of one of the city's most popular entertainers, but it's nothing compared with what she reveals in "Crazy Enough," her autobiographical musical opening Friday at Portland Center Stage. By turns hilarious and heart-wrenching, the show recounts how she faced a family history of mental illness and followed a wobbly path through sex, drugs and rock'n'roll into, well, stable domesticity.
Her parents, in whose memory the book is dedicated, were not the most adventurous eaters, although they would venture across state lines for a memorable meal, like soft-shell crabs in Maryland or chocolate gelato in Little Italy. What she inherited from them, she says, is an excitement about food.

That is significant because ever since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the FBI has stressed the importance of working with leaders in the Muslim community as an important part of the battle against terrorism. The FBI review began last September after Wired.com reported that the FBI had discontinued a lecture in which the instructor told agent trainees in Virginia that the more devout a Muslim is, the more likely he is to be violent.
That's not to say there aren't issues.
Blood circulating through your body moves with a certain force -- that's your blood pressure. This force can be affected by how strongly the heart is pumping and by the size of the vessels the blood is moving through. Blood moves through large arteries into smaller vessels called arterioles, which can expand and contract. When they expand, blood pressure goes down. When they contract, blood pressure goes up. (The body has some very good reasons and complicated systems for doing this.)
The idea has gained little traction. Instead, there is a sense that, even with much more modest notions, government intervention is not the answer. The National Association of Realtors, the driving force behind the credit last year, is not calling for a new round of stimulus.

Though Phoenix outshot Nashville through the first two periods, Rinne wasn't tested much. He had a shot go off the post in the first period and saw heavier traffic in the crease as the Coyotes shook off a sluggish start. But he never faltered after giving up five goals in Sunday's 5-3 Game 2 loss — the Predators' worst performance of the postseason — snapping Phoenix's team-record streak of three consecutive road playoff wins and a run of three straight wins in Nashville overall snapped. The Coyotes had given up just four goals on the road in the playoffs before Wednesday.

The Indians optioned LaPorta to Class AAA Columbus on Aug. 30 to make room for right-hander Jeanmar Gomez.

The talks between these teenagers started at the simplest level but quickly escalated to issues they deal with the daily, such as bullying, discrimination, senseless shootings and gang violence. They shared their thoughts about homosexuality and tried to dispel misperceptions that each held about the other — that American kids were spoiled and ungrateful and those in Africa were uneducated and deprived.
Don't do it. (Laughs.) Isn't it funny how everybody thinks they should be working for themselves? They need to open their eyes to what being an entrepreneur really is. When you work for yourself, you're the worker, you're HR, you're the janitor. I heard this interview with the guys from Method Soap, and in four years, they've created a $10 million business. But there are no guarantees. The chances of that happening are slim. So when you go into business for yourself, be prepared to do all kinds of things, or you're not going to make it. Your skin has got to be pretty tough. You'd better be knowledgeable about what it is you're doing. Everyone knows the story about the dentist that decided to open up a theme restaurant. . . . You've got to know a little bit about everything.

But when you blow leads to bad teams, that's on the players too. How many times have we heard, say, Ty Lawson talk about needing to pound the gas pedal with a lead and make an eight-point lead a 16-point lead?

Slay has proposed two bills that would take control of the Firemen's Retirement System of St. Louis and greatly reduce benefits.

There are several reasons for this. Charter schools have generally thrived under a lottery enrollment system, in which motivated parents sign up their children for a random drawing that might allow them a seat in the school. But under the parent trigger, charter schools have to accept all students within the low-performing school's attendance boundaries, just as regular public schools do. Few charter operators have been willing to work under that scenario, which tends to result in less dramatic test results for them. Furthermore, the current woeful state of school funding makes it difficult if not impossible for charter schools to provide needed resources — just as it's difficult for traditional public schools. And turning around a deeply troubled school is harder than starting a new school with its own campus culture.

I wouldn't order the Turkey Burger special again ($7). It was seasoned enough to morph from burger into sausage and leave behind the mild flavor of the meat.

Miller's bet that a beer with National Premium's history has appeal has precedent. He's following in the footsteps of entrepreneurs and beer corporations that have been hawking nostalgia for a decade to sell brands that had lost relevance. The trend started in the early 2000s, when Pabst Blue Ribbon was reclaimed by young drinkers who liked its lack of advertising and were turned off by the busty babes in billboards and loud TV ads that dominate mainstream beer marketing.

With the flood of cash has come new, tighter strings. Schools taking the money have to adopt one of four stringent improvement models.

The last three months of the season went about as opposite as the first three for Howard. He rolled out to a great start, repeatedly turning in big performances that earned him his first All-Star selection. Then he suffered a broken finger, then suffered an injured groin, twice. He returned to play five games before the playoffs, and said the injuries "were nonissues" by the time the Predators series began.

"I think I did the right thing. For the average person out there who really thought I was just trying to get up and just leave for no reason, that really was a big key in my decision," Anthony said. "I knew free agency was coming, I knew it would be altered, I knew it'd be messed up, so imagine if I'd have stayed. I'd have been a free agent now in limbo. It'd have just been all bad."
I didn't expect much from the re-imagineered ride, found at any freeway fun park or traveling carnival. But I could not have imagined much less from the team at Walt Disney Imagineering.

That's promising. Ray's Sausage Company shouldn't have been forced to pay handsomely for a stench that it didn't create. It deserves some sort of moral-based compensation.
“Like so many issues in education, you can find people in support of and against an idea,” he said. “Some will say school uniforms don’t improve student achievement, while others say it brings a greater sense of order, reduces student attention on materialistic items during school hours, and possibly increases safety as it can help to better identify who belongs on school grounds. NJSBA doesn’t suggest that schools should, or should not, implement school uniform policies. Rather, we believe it should be a local decision, because what works in one community may not have the same success in another.”

Veterans courts go further. They are the latest of California's "collaborative justice" courts for specific kinds of cases, such as domestic violence, elder abuse and mental health. Vet courts are modeled on drug courts, the best known of the specialty courts.
