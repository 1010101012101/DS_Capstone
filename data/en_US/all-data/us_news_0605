It changed our country, for good and for ill, and to understand that better I think we need to begin by exploring more deeply how it affected us as individuals. Life was not the same after 9/11, and while things appear to be back to "normal" now, we all know it's a new normal, that things aren't the same.

"Consumers are very, very, very aware of this -- more so than I've seen in years," said Alfred Huger, vice president of Symantec Security Response. "Enterprises are certainly aware of this, and they're treating this seriously, but no more so than other threats they're faced with."
Pierre LeBrun, ESPN.com: "The San Jose Sharks like their team, especially with Douglas Murray and Martin Havlat coming back before the playoffs, plus Monday's solid acquisitions of forwards Daniel Winnik and T.J. Galiardi, but, oh, there could have been a bigger move . . . There was renewed dialogue between the Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets regarding our favorite headline-grabbing, non-traded player, Rick Nash. And why not? Nash has listed San Jose as go-to team for him, based on the desire to play with his buddy Joe Thornton. But the talks hit the same roadblock they did over the past weeks: Logan Couture. The Jackets demanded him in any deal right to the end. The Sharks were never, ever, going to pay that price."

From the moment we arrived at the airport and toasted our adventure with mimosas, to the end, when we toasted the success of our trip with rum runners at Margaritaville, it was a total joy. We were like two kids when we entered Hogsmeade: We oohed and aahed and made a beeline for the butterbeer (which neither of us liked). We were wide-eyed as we made our way through Hogwarts, amazed at how the nuances were captured.

Now it's all over but the litigation and revenge: Current fired Olbermann, and Olbermann is ready to sue Current and expose Al Gore's alleged outrages against decency. It's hard to see what Gore did to deserve the storm of toxicity Olbermann is about to bring down on his head. Except, of course, he did hire Keith Olbermann.

Those lease terms require the Edward Jones Dome to meet "first-tier" requirements - in other words be considered among the top quarter of the stadiums in the league. If not, the Rams could be free to relocate after the 2014 season.
Questions at the court this week days showed a strong ideological division between the liberal justices who seem inclined to uphold the law in its entirety and the conservative justices whose skepticism about Congress’ power to force people to buy insurance suggests deep trouble for the insurance requirement, and possibly the entire law.

At many Italian restaurants the main courses are letdowns, but they are some of my favorite things here. Finding excellent whole fish isn't difficult these days, but the roasted dorade ($26) is among the best. It comes out with the head intact, so you can dig for the cheeks, but it's been boned in the kitchen; the only thing left on the inside are a few slices of Meyer lemon and herbs that add complexity to the delicate meat. It's accompanied by a refreshing citrus and fennel salad.

Practicing a few balancing acts every day is smart prevention, because moves that force you to stay upright help maintain muscle as you age. (Muscle loss is a more important cause of losing your balance than even B-12 deficiency.) Balancing exercises also improve your proprioception -- that's how you know where your body parts are without looking at them. These three will get you started:

On one occasion, prosecutors said, Ruiz took a seat next to a 17-year-old girl in a relatively empty Caltrain car and started asking her sexual questions. The inquiries escalated into groping as well as unwanted kisses and continued with him blocking her way as she tried to escape.
Gronkowski has 20 touchdowns in 26 games, surpassing Mike Ditka's mark of 31 for the fewest games needed by a tight end to reach 20 touchdowns.

When the Lowcountry Southern place took over the former Santi space in the upscale neighborhood, its owners, Dennis and Ann Tussey, retained Santi chef Doug Richey, who was undeniably an expert in Italian and Wine Country cooking. But alas, delicate sugo skills didn't translate well to the fried chicken, which, over two meals, I found dry and underseasoned, or to the musty-flavored mac 'n' cheese or soupy, bland shrimp and grits.

In a petition to the commission, the company, known locally as AC Gateway LLC, says applying for a casino licensing and putting up a $1 million deposit "would be imprudent without first obtaining the requisite CAFRA permit from the NJDEP and other regulatory approvals on which the proposed development of the staged casino facility project depends."
So in the end, he said, all they remember are the coincidences.
Well, perhaps the after effects of all those rich foods.
2. Buddy Dyer. One could actually make a pretty compelling case that the Orlando mayor deserves the top spot this year. In fact, several panelists did. While he and the No. 1 guy passed the package of downtown venues together, there's little question that this billion-plus-dollar effort was Dyer's baby. Dyer, 49, also commands influence because he seems to have the entire City Council at his beck and call. Whether that's a result of smart politicking or simply go-along-get-along council members, what Hizzoner wants, Hizzoner gets. Dyer's biggest challenge may be proving that he can do more than just build things like stadiums and skylines -- and deal with the everyday issues and problems down at street level.

Manguso addresses this immediately, boldly, bodily. "I really wish I could show you my penis, he said, as if it were a painting or a country," she writes. This was because he was, by all accounts, well endowed, enough for it to be a topic of discussion around the Manhattan loft they shared with a number of roommates in the late '90s. "If we'd ever been to bed, we could never have talked about his penis as we did."
When I mentioned "Be With Me" at the beginning of this piece, I did so with a conviction that it deserves wide distribution, and will find an appreciative audience. Almost silent and mysteriously disjointed at first, the film comes together into something that's as accessible as it is beautiful.
"I'm frustrated that they (Republican) have directed hundreds of millions of dollars to an unrequired missile defense system that our own military leaders have clearly stated they do not want and cannot even capitalize on at this time, even as Republicans claim the need for fiscal restraint," said Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., in a statement.
Allowing teams and agents to resume dialogue is also significant, since there are dozens of players who had contracts expire when last season ended and will try to either re-sign with their most recent teams or find new clubs.
I suspect this is because, when it appears, wine comes with the modifications of season's tidings - mulled into German gluhwein or Swedish glogg, or mixed with spice and fruit to serve hot in a punch. Such brews pervade Christmas literature, both fictional and factual, from Dickens onward. When wine does appear, it's often fortified and sweet, like the Port that forms the base for so many British punches, most famously the bowl of Smoking Bishop that Scrooge promises Bob Cratchit. (Even then it competes with beer, the base of the drink that was the payoff to wassailers for making their singing rounds.)
He's been out of radio since the controversy, but that changed this week with the firing of morning show host Scott Kaplan. As a result, Kaplan's 11-year show with Billy Ray Smith was canceled, leaving a morning show void filled by Palet and his longtime radio show partner, Jeff Dotseth.

Back in the sun, it seems as though my search might be over. I am drawn to the warm patina of brass wall hooks arrayed on a table. At $10 to $12 each, I buy three. Not antiques, but they look old and lovely and are small enough to pack. Each time I use them, I'll be back in Tuscany for a moment.

During one visit, where we rendezvoused with an engaging Placerville couple, Bill and Lois Fuser, our appetizers included oysters ($14), which were raw and tasty, and two large duck ravioli ($12), which were very nearly and definitely not. Almond sage butter and pomegranate glaze notwithstanding, the severely undercooked ravioli was a mess no one dared devour after the first grimacing nibbles. Throw in some pretty fair crab cakes ($16), and the money is only just beginning to fly out of our pockets.

But the opposition now is raising the stakes, even setting up a small round-the-clock demonstration in a Moscow square. That puts Putin in a bind. Either he invites international opprobrium with tough police action or risks allowing the opposition to expand its actions to something resembling the 2004 Orange Revolution tent-camp in Kiev. Putin denounced both the Orange Revolution and the similar Rose Revolution in Georgia — and allowing similar actions in Moscow could be seen as blinking first in a staring match.

Verrilli: ... With respect to what insurance has to cover, your honor, I think Congress is entitled the latitude of making the judgments of what the appropriate scope of coverage is. And the problem here in this market is that ... you may think you're perfectly healthy and you may think ... that you're being forced to subsidize somebody else, but this is not a market in which you can say that there is an immutable class of healthy people who are being forced to subsidize the unhealthy. This is a market in which you may be healthy one day and you may be a very unhealthy participant in that market the next day and that is a fundamental difference.

Winning the yearslong endurance test was credited to a "perfect storm" of events, according to the unflappable sponsors, Sen. Julie Rosen, R-Fairmont, and Rep. Morrie Lanning, R-Moorhead, and other observers. They cited the flour-sack video image of snow pouring into the deflating Metrodome in December 2010; the strong and enthusiastic support of DFL Gov.

AFS (American Field Service) is America’s oldest exchange student program, tracing its origins to the first World War and to college-age volunteer stretcher-bearers. In the trenches, the stretcher-bearers learned, first-hand, while caring for both friend and foe alike, that there is a fundamental humanity shared by all people, regardless of their country of origin. They believed, as AFS does today, that if people could get to know and understand each other, it would make it much more difficult to fight with one another — and thus, a student exchange program, dedicated to promoting peace among cultures and nations, was begun.

Berkman has struggled the past two years against lefthanded pitching. leaving an opening for Craig to find occasional time in the outfield. Jay's standing is now clouded.

As you approach the big, square barn looming over Old Avon Village, hang your preconceptions on a hitching post. That red-streaked exterior might fool you. Step into Strip and you're joining a pretty sophisticated hoedown. The crowd here is well-dressed, in keeping with the airy two-story space with plenty of striking architectural details to keep you gazing until your food arrives. Tree House Lobster Bisque, served in petite white crocks, deserves its star billing, and Strip's Maryland-style crab cakes were handsomely crisped, belying plump, creamy meat within. Throw in one of the restaurant's refreshing salads -- especially its bitter-tinged take on the blue-cheese-dressing-topped wedge (iceberg combined with radicchio and Belgian endive) -- and you could leave well fed. But you would have missed another remarkable salad, the Mile High Mozzarella, a vertical construction of surprisingly summery-tasting vegetables with tiny balls of cheese bound in a sprightly pesto. Or some delectable seafood, especially the Jamaican-spice dusted mahi-mahi featured as the Luca and a luscious pilaf of coconut-laced rice with pigeon peas. Or, for that matter, a richly flavorful porterhouse, the 24-ounce Big Daddy, rubbed with lemon, sea salt and garlic and grilled just right. Western suburban diners needn't drive far to visit one of the best places for steak, and other lusty chow, around.

The thing is, I have a cat. All cat lady jokes aside, this animal really sheds. No amount of vacuuming I was doing would pick up every intricate hair this feline left behind. I would spend hours going over every inch of my apartment, sucking up any drifting hair I could find. It was never enough; there were always traces hovering in the air, landing in the very spot I just vacuumed. I got to thinking that maybe I would need something much more powerful. This tiny sweeper wasn’t going to cut it any longer.

As with any new restaurant, not all is divine. Waiters are still finding their way; the ahi tuna taco seemed bland; there appears to be a cocktail list but no wine list presented; the Mexican chocolate brownie ($6) has none of the cinnamon-y Mexican chocolate flavor of Ibarra or other brands.

This information is collected as part of affirmative action programs. Completing or not completing the survey will not affect your hiring chances, so I have always advised applicants to fill out the survey.

Finally, a word about our comparison of Israel's treatment of Grass with Iran's treatment of dissenters. Iran's constitution perversely guarantees freedom of the press "except when it is detrimental to the principles of Islam or the rights of the public," a vague qualification that in practice has empowered the government to censor and restrict the domestic media at will. It has no such power to censor foreign newspapers, so it can only angrily denounce its critics abroad — in much the same way the Israeli government is denouncing Grass.

When Detroit's Big Three automakers controlled much of the industry, centralized stamping facilities like Twinsburg made more sense. One plant could produce thousands of doors, hoods and roofs for cars sold under different brands. But with sales falling, car companies are pushing for flexibility.

Our response: Lugar has voted with the Republican majority in the Senate 88 percent of the time for more than 20 years. Is a 12 percent deviance from the crowd really a sign of disloyalty?

Country trio Lady Antebellum couldn't be more opposite than Eminem, but their album "Need You Now" was the second-best selling album of the year, doing almost as well as "Recovery," with almost 3 million albums sold, fueled by the lovelorn title track -- a huge crossover hit for the band. Grammy voters rewarded that success, nominating them for album of the year and also record and song of the year for the hit.
"I'm telling you the truth, I was scared the whole year, the whole 10 months I was in Vietnam," said Spink, who later moved to Plainfield. "Anybody who tells you they weren't scared is full of it. You're afraid every day because you just don't know what's out there."

But there was a major division between Scalia, the court's conservative leader, and Justice Samuel Alito, a former federal prosecutor and usually a Scalia ally, over how much further the court should go beyond just saying that police can't put a GPS device on something used by a suspect without a warrant.

In a three-month span late last year, the 41-year-old legal secretary won a trip to Disneyland worth $1,600 from KSAN ("The Bone") and a trip to Maui, with an estimated value of $1,200, from KOIT. Oh: And $500 from KLLC ("Alice"). Since she began competing in radio contests in 1998, the legal secretary has won cash prizes of $2,000 and two $1,000 checks, both from KOIT, $1,000 from "Alice" in 2000 (for being "caller No. 97"), as well as a trip from "Alice" to Lake Tahoe with the then-morning show team of Sarah and No Name, and a trip to Palm Springs from KNGY ("Energy"). She's also collected some smaller items from "Alice," including a $50 gift certificate to a restaurant and passes to Great America. And when she attended "Alice's" 10th anniversary party, she won a raffle prize: a kegerator that No Name personally installed at her home.
Though many dishes have an unusual juxtaposition of ingredients, the palate easily can understand them. Fruit and chocolate, for instance, cast the salmon in a different light, underlining the taste of the fish but not exaggerating it while expanding the experience. The grapes dance lightly against the backdrop of pork, pasta and cheese, providing definition for their rich consistency.
What else happened between 5 and 6 Tuesday morning, March 24, 2009, has been reconstructed from vessel tracking reports, information from weather buoys, and interviews not only with José Arias, but with marine experts, other fishermen out there that night, as well as Fuzzy Smith, the co-owner of the Lady Mary, who knew the boat, the crew and the routine aboard the scalloper better than anyone.

As dawn came Wednesday, the protest's 10th day, an almost overwhelming sense of urgency was developing around the need to resolve internal security issues that have bedeviled residents and passers-by alike. The tent city that has sprung up on the steps of Oakland City Hall has attracted a diverse range of people, many with competing ideologies and world views. Homeless people, ex-convicts, at least one registered sex offender, students, unemployed hotel workers, anarchists and reform-minded activists freely mingle together in what amounts to a democracy free-for-all.

In my last column, I wrote about the key elements of a balanced wine - acidity, extract, alcohol, tannin and sugar - and how to identify balance while you're sipping with your friends. For another approach entirely, if you ever have a chance to visit a winery and taste from a cask, do it. It's fun and slightly shocking. Your palate should not be in a frame of sipping-and-enjoyment, but rather in one of critical analysis. It's like putting on new goggles and looking at wine from a different angle.

A. This is something else. This is amazing. I never expected anything like this. I feel like I'm in the rarest position to be able to say I have a movie that's as good as the book. It's good in different ways, or better. The movie might be better than my book. The fact that I inspired Martin Scorsese to make this incredibly personal and beautiful movie is one of the great thrills of my life. It's very satisfying to create something yourself, but it's as satisfying or more satisfying to inspire someone else to make something new.
Hey, Mike: Am I pleased with the way things have gone this year? Absolutely not. Did I welcome a change after two 5-11 seasons with a very old team? Absolutely. The Browns' bumbling ways this season are helping to make Eric Mangini a mythical figure in the minds of some.

When private-sector workers whose employers come up short on revenues have to take pay cuts, they don't get extra days off. If you're self-employed and business is slow, not only won't you take the day off, you'll work longer to make up for the revenue loss. If we regard the services of government workers as essential — whether they're teachers or the folks who man the counters at the Department of Motor Vehicles — why should the public be denied those services? Sorry about the pay cut, but they should still show up for work.

Here's a wild thought: Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch is in trouble back home with at least some Republicans for not being conservative enough. FreedomWorks, the Dick Armey-led PAC that's very close to the Tea Party movement, has targeted Hatch for defeat when he seeks his seventh term next year. The group says he's too squishy because he's voted to raise the debt ceiling repeatedly (most senior members of Congress have) and supported TARP. Another conservative powerhouse, the Club for Growth, has publicly urged Rep. Jason Chaffetz to challenge Hatch. Hatch clearly knows he's under the gun. He's been shoring up his bona fides on the right -- just this week, he stood with Sens. Jim DeMint, Pat Toomey and Marco Rubio -- Tea Party icons, one and all -- to demand a balanced-budget amendment -- and was visible at last weekend's GOP state convention in Utah. Remember that last year, Utah's other veteran GOP senator, Robert Bennett, was toppled at the state convention when he couldn't win enough delegates even to force a primary. Hatch certainly doesn't want to follow that path to retirement. But polls show the 77-year-old could be vulnerable in both a primary against Chaffetz and a general election (against Democratic Rep. Jim Matheson).
The group also decided to start meeting weekly for updates on the various investigations.

On the second count, the prosecution needed to prove that not only did she know she struck someone but that she failed to report it as soon as reasonably possible. The third requires the jury to conclude she acted with gross negligence, not just ordinary negligence.

Second reason: The Rangers don't handle good opposition quite as well as the Cardinals. They were just 31-31 against winning teams this year (38-35 including the playoffs), while the Cardinals went 30-25 against winning teams (37-29 including the playoffs). Moreover, the Rangers' victories in the postseason haven't been as decisive as the Cards'. Both teams have three one-run wins, but the Rangers needed extra innings in two other wins and won another game by just two runs. The Cards have put their opponents away more emphatically, with three wins of six runs or more, plus a three-run victory.
