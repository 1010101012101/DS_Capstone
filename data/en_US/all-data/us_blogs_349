And to finish i share my craft room with two of my pets,Sam is my gorgeous yorkie who is 11 this year so likes to sleep and the my cat is Mitzi who has now almost 18 hence all her white hairs. Luckily my boys dont mind sleeping in there when they come home for a visit.

I’m never going to be movie star beautiful, but I can be beautiful in so many other ways. We give so much value to what other’s think of us, and not enough to what we believe about ourselves. Our definition of beauty should only be based upon our belief systems — not what the media, our friends, family, men, or other women think of us. So I’m going to make my own definition for me and nobody else. It’s time to find out what it really means to beautiful by my own understanding. I may take myself apart from the inside out, and it will be by own terms and by own definition. I’m fairly certain that I can come up with a definition of beauty that is based more than on how much I weigh or don’t weigh, how I’m aging, or if I’m meeting society’s standards. Maybe instead, this time I should meet my own standards instead of trying to live up to everyone else’s.
I plan on writing little memories and tid-bits in this journal for Hannah (and us) to look back on when she gets older. Thanks for the inspiration Erica!!
The idea behind the investments from the company’s point of view is that they can buy the land in order to farm the goods growing there. These range from corn to palm oil and all other varieties of food and fuel belonging to the region.
What happened? The scientists argue that “thinking too much” about preferences caused the students to focus on all sorts of variables that didn’t matter, such as the texture of the jam or the presence of strawberry seeds.
Singapore and Egypt enjoy warm and long-standing relations. Our ties with Egypt go back to 1965, when Egypt was the first Arab country to recognise Singapore's independence and it was also the first Middle Eastern country that Singapore established diplomatic relations with in November 1966. Since then, bilateral relations have grown
It gets pretty tiring being a public figure, but I figure putting on a show for the cameras is the least I can do for you little people.

Sally Field – Murphy’s Romance
At the station, the Enterprise is attacked by the Reliant at a point in which our two running themes converge. Khan is not satisfied with simply escaping from his exile and stealing Genesis, both of which make him an extremely dangerous man. He needs for Kirk to know he has had his revenge. Likewise, Kirk has gone in by the seat of his pants, recklessly getting his ship severely attacked and a number of his crew killed. Both men’s flaws have cost them dearly.

After leaving Yellowstone National Park yesterday, we returned to the town of West Yellowstone to drop off the rental car and then back-tracked through Yellowstone to head south to Grand Teton.
So for the same reasons that Washington should not bail out General Motors, the world should not bailout America. Like GM, our economy is in desperate need of a restructuring. Spending must be replaced with savings, and consumption with production. The service sector must shrink and manufacturing must expand to fill the void. The dollar must fall, wages in America must be brought down to a competitive level, and hopefully government spending and burdensome regulation can be reduced.
Happy Saturday everybody!
So basically Spae Beetle is is a holo topcoat with a little bit of a pink/green duochrome to it. I'm not really sure if I like it layered... Maybe it's just a case of finding a colour combination I like.

Rosenberg uses his books to talk about Jesus to his readers. His passion to make disciple of all nations has inspired him to include many Biblical accounts in the books he was and is writing. The main characters in the books–Jon and Erin–manage to model how Christians should act, think, talk amidst series of struggles. Their faith had helped them overcome and succeed many trials.
He played on such Motown hits as “Runaway Child,” “Just My Imagination,” and “Cloud Nine” for The Temptations; “War” by Edwin Starr; and “What Does It Take to Win Your Love” by Junior Walker & The All Stars. He also played on non-Motown records including Funkadelic’s first album, Freda Payne’s song “Band of Gold,” and — best of all, in my book — “Who’s Making Love” by Johnny Taylor. In other words, he is one serious picker.
The bottom photo features some yarn I bought during Yarn Quest with the intent of knitting myself a long overdue Aran Scarf plus any sort of accessories I could eek out of the remaining yarn. Turquoise is one of my favorite colors and I just love Cascade 220. I've made an Aran Scarf before for a scarf exchange in which I did not receive a thank you for my efforts. I've been slightly bitter about it ever since. Now I can rectify the situation. Kind of. :)
I will post more details as they develop….
Don’t count the first part because that was the warm up but around mile 1.5 is where the 800s started. That little lip between 2 and 3 is where I turned around at the end of the street to start the next one.
For the record I thought maybe I could handle a mini-blizzard which has about 45g of carbs. Nope. Even after a walk my blood sugar was elevated.
One of the main reasons that the United States attacked Afghanistan was not to defend the country itself from terrorists, but rather, it was to pursue oil interests. The U.S. is threatening to attack Iran because of the fact that the latter has expressed plans of nuclear weaponization, yet not a single shred of evidence supports the U.S. Government’s claim. If the U.S. wanted to lay hands on Iran’s oil, and the only way of doing that is to use the nuclear issue as an excuse. If this is the case, shouldn’t Obama and his advisors, along with Israel, be charged with war crimes? And not only so, but Obama is also guilty of criminal conspiracy, as the U.S. is supplying Israel with weapons. Basically, the implications of Barack Obama are in no way limited to the war threats against Iran, but war has been the plan all along.
Just because Mandarin speech leaves my mouth comparable to that of a 3-year-old doesn’t mean I’m stupid. It doesn’t mean I’m incapable of thinking like a young adult, and it certainly doesn’t mean I don’t understand (through body language) what others are asking of me.

Maraschino acts pretty much like any other semi-transparent red glass. Semi-transparents are different from opals - they carry no opalescent sheen. They just sometimes opacify in the flame - usually underneath the top layer of transparent glass. Most "transparent" reds that aren't strikers do that. Unlike striking red, the color in a semi-transparent remains saturated, but sometimes can't be totally seen through.
But, there are others who receive criticism regularly too. Politicians, coaches, referees, teachers, lawyers, drivers, children, parents, and people who let their dogs bark all night, to name a few. In other words, Christians are not special because we get criticized by others. So get over it, please. Tim Tebow is a big boy and if he weren’t a Christian he would be criticized for his lack of passing ability, his pour throwing mechanics, and his bad decision making in games. But all that amounts to nothing when you win the game.
Believe it or not (actually, it's quite easy to believe given his penchant for puzzles and his co-writing of the film The Last of Sheila and his short-lived play Getting Away With Murder), Sondheim and book-writer James Goldman, who won an Oscar for adapting his own play, The Lion in Winter, originally intended Follies to be a musical murder mystery. As Sondheim wrote further in Finishing the Hat, a must for any Sondheim fanatic as he goes over the process and lyrics for all his shows between 1954 and 1981:

Why do they go to homes, or shelters, or vans down by the river, to parents that are crack head idiots? To people who use and abuse them, where they aren't valued or nurtured or fed healthy meals 3 times a day?
I can only do foggy delta wetland paintings in the winter, and the dry, golden hills in the summer time. No, that's not strictly true, but it is a lot harder to paint "out of season" as it were.

I HAVE to give just one more shout out to This Cupcake Card!!
This year the surprise, which wasn’t really completed until the end of the ski season, was the completion of our Legacy Bike Path which means that we can ride out or door to the next sizable town, Ogden, some forty miles away on dedicated bike path the whole way. These changes and surprises don’t occur without a lot of activism and hard work on the part of many of our citizens. In the case of the train to the library, it was felt by many, that since the free fare zone extended farther to the south than it did to the east, the eastern boundary was created in order to deny free access to the library train to people who lived in the homeless shelter downtown. This was unfair on the face of it since the free zone clearly went farther in another direction but it still took a lot of effort to get it changed. This year’s surprise, the bike path, took even more work, ten years of legal wrangling to be exact.
So that today can be better than it is
As we come back down and the sunlight grows stronger, it seeps through to illuminate the ground, where strong colours struggle through the bleaching mist. Here, rows of vines and orchard trees greet our descending balloon, and a few minutes later we’re through the mist and back on terra firma, watching the last tendrils of fog burn off to a blue sky.

And speaking of that base, I have some from a second supplier being shipped out any day now. The only (small) con is that it will ship from California just like the base from TKB does. This means it'll take a whole 7 days to arrive. But hey, what's one more week, right? :)

And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat. As did Mr. Cronkwers McGwilligers of Billinghay, Lincolnshire.

Our friend and neighour, the former syndic and ground floor owner, is now seriously ill and will be having major surgery around the time of our next meet with the Juge de Paix. He will then be convalescing for 3 months, right around the time we may need to do the major works on the house. We are hoping beyond hope that his brain tumour is not cancerous. After months of telling ourselves that whatever happens we at least have our health, this is a knock to our thin armour of optimism.
In the last 24 hours, many interesting articles, Facebook conversations, phone conversations and real-time face to face talks converged in such a way I really wanted to connect with parents ‘out there’ in the blogosphere.
Pal, you are your own Savior, remember this always. Even against demonic beings only you can be saved from them when you get attacked. And a schizophrenic normally gets to be attacked by a team of demons as huge a size as a platoon of evil predators who use you to suck your Light from out of you while you remain helpless. Save yourself, and forge that will to save yourself.

I remember my mother loved to have fun with us. She didn't care about what "you are suppose to do". as a mother raising children. I remember going for walks on the beach and before we were done all three of us were jumping and swimming in the ocean waves with all of our cloths on. I remember her letting me drive the car, while she slept in the back seat, in an unfinished suburb where there were only the roads. I remember going to the drive-in in our pj, with pillows, blankets and goodies to eat. I remember it was always the three of us, we had each other. We fought, played and worked together.

I sense you're getting impatient here, with both the critiques and the comments. You've written the novel, and you just want to get started on getting it in front of people. I'm impatient too, and easily frustrated (just ask the minions who have to deal with me in the office on a daily basis--they have bolt holes for when it gets rough!)

Skunk cabbage (symplocarpus foetidus) covers the swamp. This a weird plant, it’s flowers emerge so early and emit such heat that they melt the snow around them.

The show has a very Loli Basketball related feel to it, though not the same production company, rather, Feel was responsible for Mayo Chiki, which is why you might find its visual style familiar. If this was a normal family dynamic I’d say nothing interesting would happen, but you have a guy whose older sister is married with kids, a bizarre female classmate probably after his nuts, and three girls, one whom has a crush on him, the other probably too, and a three-year-old who probably doesn’t know what is going on. It’s a recipe for random, but hopefully it is a better story-driven show than not.
Revolution is very negative, the murders are off course very negative, but the murders, the rapes, the fraud, corruption all eventually get sorted out by effective revolution. In the end the revolutionaries also meet their own demise. The ANC regime is slowly but surely being taken out and a revolution is rising against them. Unfortunately, because people are not seeing the revolution and they’re not seeing the big picture, they are kicking against the revolution, rather than joining and supporting it.

I do have a new thing to practise. I am besotted with my camera (remember, Bob, my son, gave it to me for my birthday?). When I'm not doing work/writing related things, or trying to shore up the pantry walls, I most often have my camera at my face, usually aimed at something edible. I cook, I shoot, I eat. Cooking and baking have always been the way I recalibrate, and now the camera adds an extra dimension. It's turned kitchen activity into more of a challenge, and thus more fun, more rewarding.
7) Don't send critiques to authors who have asked me for blurbs. (Yes, I have done this, and yes, I do feel bad about it. But in my defense, I was trying to help the authors improve their books.)

So not only has Ireland“the most challenged mortgage book” in GE but the company is apparently accepting 40c in the euro for the loans. Residential property in Ireland has dropped by an average of 49% from peak according to the Central Statistics Office, unemployment is bad at just over 14% but we still have draconian bankruptcy rules which practically rule out bankruptcy for most people – though it should be said these rules are set to change, and Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence Alan Shatter is supposed to be publishing new legislation by the end of this month. Permanent TSB is probably the Irish bank most exposed to the mortgage crisis and for 2011 it showed it has outstanding lending of €35.7bn and a cumulative provision for losses of €2.3bn or 6%, one tenth of the loss now apparently being booked by GE. In that context the GE valuation is sobering.
After three months in Fendleton’s Women’s Prison, Moody had been given court permission to return to her father’s home in Rubicon Ranch. When the judge realized who Moody’s father was and where Rubicon Ranch was located, he sarcastically told Moody she might wish to stay at Fendleton rather than move to another type of prison.
You see, if you play down religion and play up God, we will be doing great works for humanity. And so, I have written songs like ‘Your God is my God’, ‘Mustapha and Christopher’ in recent times and it’s also included in my upcoming album. Mustapha meaning Muslims and Christopher meaning Christians. (Singing) The boy called Mustapha, like the moon and star are far. He was brought up to be forever far from that Christopher. This they called religion. But if we listen to nature’s call and don’t let religious differences make a wall, then Mustapha and Christopher will live together. This is my religion and my message.
Also hysterical. On the first page of SNUFF, we learn that goblins have a cult of Unggue, “a remarkably complex resurrection-based religion founded on the sanctity of bodily secretions.” Every goblin makes gorgeous ritual containers for earwax, nail clippings, and snot. Fortunately, water and food are viewed as passing though the body without becoming part of it.

But now, being short a bit will mean being short a few more cents (5X more) as the nickel becomes our smallest possible coin. “Every penny counts” doesn’t have quite as much meaning. We used to use that one in fundraising, but now every last bit of change counts less and less as the economy rises. As I was going door to door one day for 30 Hour Famine (which raises money for undernourished people worldwide through World Vision), a mom asked her seven-year-old son, “Do you want to give some money to help kids in Africa?”
And now the Supreme Court has decided that massive multi-national corporations—whose very existence is defined by the maximization of profit to the exclusion of any and all other concerns—can say pretty much whatever they want to influence our political elections. This is based on a supremely obscene decision in 1886 (Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific R. Co., 118 U.S. 394) that corporations enjoy the same rights as people. Huge, incredibly rich, totally immoral people.

Can the surviving owners afford to take this risk? Compare this risk to the annual premium cost necessary to provide a $400,000 15-year term life policy that would immediately fund the buy-sell liability in the event of an untimely death. Such a policy would have a total premium of approximately $1,500. The new sales necessary to support this non-deductable expense each year while the premium is payable would be $46,154. This is just a single, hypothetical example; the actual costs would vary based on age, gender, relative health and the issuing insurance company.
For instance, research shows that youth clubs without proper, guided activities are a breeding ground for trouble not a hindrance to it.

If you’ve never seen a redwood, you might be forgiven for thinking the only thing the tree is good for is making patio furniture and backyard decks. But if you have ever walked in the fragrant cathedral of these gorgeous monsters, cranked your head back, and looked up the immense trunks into a sky-scraping canopy of shimmering green, then you understand why these gentle giants that are the Earth’s tallest, and some of the oldest and most massive living things, have inspired people to try valiantly to save them from clear-cutting, wholesale harvest, and degradation.
During the period of alignments that is approaching this month, your frequencies will begin to entrain with the music that is being played by the universe. It is quite possible that the feeling you get may be something like wanting to get up and dance. Just as music is an excellent way to transmit feelings, this music is transmitting to you the universal love of your Creator. Many other notes in your personal tunes will either come into alignment or be released as you ‘hear’ more and more of the composition.
The sudden news of me no longer being here, could you handle the grief?
One such item I have is my electric water kettle. Growing up, we didn't have one of these things, we only ever had the ones you put on the stove. But when I moved out of my parents' this was one of the first things we bought. I REALLY love hot chocolate! And it's so useful to have it STOP when it's reached boiling point. My dad has ruined quite a few kettles because he just went away to do handy stuff in his garage and forgot it was on. (He's stubborn, he does NOT want an electric one.)
I the Lord, search the heart, I test the mind. Could it be that my troubles are a result of God searching my heart and testing my mind? Maybe I have overlooked God’s involvement and given his glory over to the heartache telling me that the enemy is attacking my marriage. Did I forget the deal was for better and for worse?

The reason we went was to see Anthropormorphism, the opening for artist Dawn Yanagihara, which mainly consisted of gracefully faded chimeras: bird people, deer people, lion-headed people. The effect was consistently antiqued, not necessarily a step backwards in time, but sideways, into a world that never was. Little nuances like an e mail sign up sheet that was a little league list from a Texas town in the 50s, the spell was complete and thorough. More graphic design than fine art, i didn't feel like this was art for the ages, although it was tasteful and would look nice on yr walls. She was selling post-cards and prints, (in old-fashioned manila envelopes), and looked like she had people lining up to give her money; people must've liked it. I would like to see what this artist does, when no is looking, her execution is impeccable and her attention to nuance, detail, and mood, to create an emotional experience, is impressive, and appealing to mine eyes. Anthropormorphism is a figure of the times.
I love these films, and wanted to share them with ya. Peace.

The summer before I was to start junior high school (usually called middle school now), my home town expanded its city limits to include our home and I was transferred. I had few friends in school, so leaving the county school system to attend the city junior high school didn’t bother me – until I went the first day of the 7th grade. I knew a lot of the kids from Sunday School, but there were far more kids I had never even seen before. Add to that the fact that word spread quickly that not only was I the new kid, but that my father had killed my mother and was in prison – well, you get the idea. It took almost 2 years before I had any friends because I was basically a loner (Mama said I talked too much and shouldn’t tell “outsiders” about family business) and I became hostile because of the teasing, whispering and side-long glances. Somewhere in those two years I learned to “not see or hear” – this is different from ignoring – I didn’t learn until many years later that I had begun to use dissociation to escape unpleasantness (isn’t that a delicate, nice word for all the shit kids endure?). By the time I began high school (which was the ninth grade in our school system), I had formed two friendships and quite a few “close acquaintances.” It didn’t hurt that I was in the high school band in the seventh grade and was a majorette when I entered my freshman year in high school.
Hoping to have a garage sale fundraiser Saturday for our churches Mexico mission trip for teens. Other than that...maybe we will think about getting out some summer clothes for Orlando. (Just days away- 18 days to be exact- the countdown is on!)
Amelia found the garbage bags in the towel closet, right where Frank had said they were. Why would someone keep garbage bags there?, she wondered. In the closet was also a kindergarten class sized refill container of bubble solution (with two wands! according to the label). There was also one shelf that had extra statuettes still in their collectable boxes, much like the ones she had seen Penelope standing by earlier. What a quirky guy, that Frank, she thought, and smiled widely, eyes aflutter.

Once her eyes were finished, it was time to get started on Jade’s base. I used a new purchase on Jade’s cheeks, an Illamasqua blusher in a bright coral colour, and it looked stunning. The blusher is highly pigmented and I only needed to dust her with a small amount for a real colour pop. Then, I used a creamy highlighter along her cheekbones to give myself an outline, and topped this up with the bright yellow Lime Crime pigment to give her contouring an extra pop. This, to me, was what really made the makeup feel asian inspired.

I am stressed in the Single Mummy Zone. The problems I was experiencing before I left my marriage, and all of the ones just afterwards, have reappeared. I am having to go through mediation, because the ex is challenging access (he wants 'half' of the children, ie, he wants them to live with him every other week) and money (he wants to pay none on a regular basis, as opposed to the 'none' from the money that he stopped paying last year) and he's not backing down, and its hurting me.

For example, the value assigned by placement agencies to the educational qualifications of British caregivers (e.g. Nursery Nurse Examination Board certificate) in comparison to the educational qualifications of Filipino caregivers, constructs Europeans as professionals and Filipinas as servants (Pratt, 1999). These distinctions then explain the different types of employment assigned to different ethnic groups. European trained nannies are seen as not suitable for housekeeping while Filipinas are considered specialists for this labour market niche (England and Stiell, 1997).

Further from the bad quality from the league players, coach Pitso Mosimane called closer cooperation from all stakeholders to ensure the national team is thoroughly prepared for the their games. There is risk of failing to qualify for 2013 Africa Cup of Nations and the 2014 Fifa World Cup starting in June this year. What am I talking about by saying risk? The team has not qualified for the current tournament, so it is actually more normal to fail to qualify.

In the meantime, while I am recovering, I would like to direct your attention to a tumblr Lisa got me addicted to. It's called Hey Girl! and it combines the best teachery jargon with amazing man candy! Any teacher should make this a daily read and laugh! I promise, you won't regret it.
This year, in addition to helping at the farm, I have been spending much of my time preparing for my SE (Structural Engineering) exam. If I pass, I will be a Professional Engineer, allowing me to seal construction documents in Kansas. The test has two portions, each 8 hours long (16 hrs total next Friday and Saturday). It covers a wide variety of material, and as you can imagine, requires quite a bit of studying. It’s been a long road, but the end is in sight.

Too, I feel like I have a purpose in mind. For so many years, "just surviving" was my purpose. I was very young when I became a parent, and the children pretty much all came at the same time. At 22 years old, I was a young newlywed. At 23, I had premature twins. At 25 and 4 days, I had my third child. Three kids under the age of 2, and I was barely out of my childhood myself. I didn't know what I was doing. I couldn't hardly see what God was thinking when He gave me all those kids, I was so sure I couldn't do it and that I was going to majorly screw them up. So often, it was all I could do just to get to the next day. I couldn't let myself even THINK past that next day, much less plan and dream about what might come after it.

I also received The Teacher’s handbook ($4.95 for the PDF download, $15.00 print) provides teaching tips and complete information for using each of the We Choose Virtues tools. It was packed with information, but much of it was not relevant to me, since I was only using the Virtue Clues cards. It would be a wonderful resource if I had more of the materials.
Pumpkin, in the food blog world, is seasonal. Copious amounts of pumpkin recipes come up around October and die off after the new year. I say, “why?” I say let’s enjoy this fruit all year. I say this with love and knowledge of three cans of pumpkin sitting in my pantry that I would like to use up. I dare you to tell me that pumpkin pancakes were not a fabulous idea. I dare you … and you have been warned to take cover.
Buttons are a bit of stumbling block, aren’t they? Finding the right buttons can be the most challenging issue for a WIP. First you have to find somewhere that has a decent collection. For me, this has meant trundling all the way in to Dublin Woolen Mills in Dublin City Centre (or, in the case of the lovely timber toggles shown, prevailing upon a member of my knitting group). Then there’s the arduous task of whittling down the choice in terms of suitable colours and sizes. It’s a good plan to have the WIP in question with you (as I’ve learned the hard way).
Still it was a great album. Wikipedia might not think this one was part of Pavement’s lo-fi thing but it’s still a long way from what you’d call pristine. It’s sloppy and full of associative tricks to the lyrics that shouldn’t work but do. Nice jangly guitars with unrehearsed-sounding solos. Name-check on Smashing Pumpkins and STP. Such a long time ago. Hard to remember exactly where I was in 94. Living with Paul on Larkin Street I suppose.

The current world population is roughly 6.8 billion. If we have every person on earth make a prediction about the end of the world by picking a distinct day between now and 6.8 billion days from now, we'll have the next 18.6 million years covered. When the world ends, we'll check the list and see who picked the correct day. That person will be the person we can trust, and we can start making life plans around his/her prediction.

Speaking ahead of the IMF’s annual meeting attended by the world’s leading finance ministers and central bankers in Washington, Lagarde said: “We are seeing a light recovery, blowing in a spring wind, but we are also seeing some very dark clouds on the horizon – which is another way of saying there is a bit of recovery, timid and a fragile situation with still high risks.”

Brewer’s Tasting Dinner
Now that we finally know Rajon Rondo won’t be available for Game 2 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal between the Boston Celtics and Atlanta Hawks, a line of -4 can be found across the board. The line opened up Atlanta -3.5 at most places, but has leveled off at -4 at a majority of places.
Even if we ignore the vexing question of how Option 2 could be ordered, let alone implemented, without hurling a country into a non-electoral discontinuity, we need to ask a few questions about its utility in comparison with other options, which, as I suggested above, now seem to me to be slightly broader than I had suggested originally in SGW. So let us suspend our disbelief for a moment. Imagine that a hypothetical Wilders government announces that most Muslims and people of Muslim heritage are to be deported from the Netherlands, without the country descending directly into chaos. In this case, we could say with some confidence that many, if not all, of the following consequences would be observed:
The Middle East on your world is a very active spiritual center and contains within it so very many important and potent gates of energy which bring through the Logos energy forming and Creating your bodies and your entire realities and indeed your entire spirit complexes as well, and your dark know how important these areas are to the evolution of humanity which is why they have deliberately perpetrated mass acts against the souls existing in these areas, while at the same time setting up false regimes and puppet dictators who gain the trust of so many souls existing in these regions who buy into the propaganda and feel within themselves that they must go to any extremes to protect their beliefs and gain a good grace of their prophets.

After nine years, researchers found that people who drink four or more cups of coffee a day are at no higher risk of disease than those who drink less than one cup of coffee a day. The Mayo Clinic reported that previous studies that linked coffee to disease did not account for other factors such as smoking and lack of exercise.

We finally sold our home after four years of trying and we did it without going upside-down. We found a new large, yet cozy home just steps from the elementary and high school. We are renting it and are experiencing the bliss of non-home ownership. Even though this place is 4 years new, it has some electrical problems and the roof is leaking. We keep the landlords apprised and go about our daily business and they coordinate the contractors to fix things.
When you’re young and someone your age gets deathly ill, it hits you like a ton of bricks. It sparks something inside you to impact the world (youth are just that way!). So, when we found out that Corey had cancer, we were compelled to do something about it. My friends and I founded a nonprofit event to raise money for families in Elkhart County who have a pediatric cancer patient. When we started looking for families to raise money for each year, I did a complete double take. I had NO IDEA how many kids were getting cancer, right in my backyard. As a doctor, I work everyday to erase that statistic, but as a friend, I help run “Cockopalooza.” We named our yearly event after Corey Cox, that often goes by “Cocko.” We head out to Elcona Country Club for a Freedomball tournament (essentially wiffle ball), a golf scramble, and a cornhole tourney every year and have a blast seeing the community come together (we even get the kids cleared for large groups and outdoor activity to come play with us-that makes it all worth it!). All the proceeds raised go directly to those kids and their families battling cancer in Elkhart County.

I recently went to an event where there were lots of writers chatting to each other about life, the universe and chocolate (the nibbles provided were very good). And, many people there were concerned about the future. Not the rising flood waters seeping into out repossessed homes, mind. But ebooks. The digital revolution that has changed music and TV and film now really does seem to be headed for the book world.

I used 3 Birds in Parade (starting to be one of my favorite cartridges). I chose the Santa on pg 43 and cut all pieces at 4.50 using my gypsy. I used Stickles (X-mas Red) on the boots and hat and (Clear) on the beard and all areas that are white. Peachy Keen Everyday Character Face Assortment for the face. Micheals Recollection Kraft cardstock 4x6. Tim Holtzs Stamper Anonymous "Mini Holidays 2" and his Distress Ink " fire brick". Spellbinder Nestabilities Labels 8 (die #8 largest) and Petite Scalloped Ovals Large (#2) and Memento Ink Tuxedo Black. The bird was cut from scraps that I have in a bin. I am trying to go to my scrap bin first before reaching for new sheets of paper. Mixture od Recollections, Brazzil and Archiver's cardstock. Its mainly the paper I buy. I also used a lot of pop dots to raise the bird and some lower profile pop dots for the "Merry Christmas".
I mean this is someone who is going to be a huge part of your life.
Because apparently you can NOT be Irish-green and Gay-pink at the same time. At least that’s what the NYC parade organizers think because the gays ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MARCH on St. Paddy’s Day. Let me amend that, they ARE allowed to march, just as long as they don’t “publicize their sexuality”.

The transition to vegetarianism can be smoother for those who make informed choices regarding dietary practices. Sound nutritional guidelines include decreasing fat intake, increasing fiber, and emphasizing fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains while avoiding processed foods and sugar.

I remember the latter with a special reverence. My friends and I, sometimes just me as I was an odd kid, would have to trek through a huge cornfield (corn, heh, what else?) to get to the tree line in our little town. I remember thinking that just the trek across the barren — or fruitful, it really didn’t make a difference — field was exhausting, that I’d have nothing left once we got to the small clearing that was the best entrance into the forest (for the rest of it was nothing but a wall of trees). But every time, we’d arrive unto the forest and I’d have this renewed vigor that prepped me for adventure and exploration.

With rotations, the number of troops serving under the alliance’s command in Southeastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East is likely in the millions. In 2010 the American commander of the Transit Center at Manas in Kyrgyzstan said that 55,000 NATO troops had been airlifted through that base to Afghanistan in May of that year, an annual rate of two-thirds of a million at a time when an estimated 140,000 of 152,000 foreign troops in Afghanistan were serving under NATO’s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF).

When we decided to go to a pub, that was when I discovered I'd left my lights on for the last few hours. Luckily, I carry a set of jump-leads... and the Land Rover carries a second battery, to power the winch...

Hubby had the week off of work. We spent some good quality time picking out new bathroom tile and accessories. Then he "relaxed" by ripping out the old and putting in the new ~ floor anyway. I am still working on painting the trim and next up are the walls, now that I've decided on a paint color.
I plod back to the hen pens in the field to drop the pop'oles on birds which acknowledge my passing visit with some sotto voce hen-talk. In a sort of mini experimental tribute to my just-met walking friends I switch off the torch and, giving my eyes a moment or two to adjust to the darkness, make my way tentatively back to the house through the garden.
Now some of you will know I support some of what the BNP stand for – however, I can not think of any reason why someone would want to avoid a debate with him – if you believe in what you say, what you stand for, and what is right – surely you would argue with Old St. Nick himself.
It was another rather misty day, and when we left in the morning, a cold one! My grandmother, determined not to get lost (as she very often does), arranged to follow us for the entire way to Montreal. She stopped where we stopped, turned where we turned. It was nice to have her with us for the trip. And, of course, Emi and I wrote poetry!
In fact, it is estimated that for men 40 and older, the risk for developing AF is 26 percent, and for women the risk is slightly less at 23 percent. These risks are not associated with congestive heart failure (CHF) or heart attacks (however the risk may increase with either CHF or heart attacks).

-Don't tell me horror stories of your neighbor or cousin or mother who had it worse. The last thing I need to hear right now is that it is possible to have this happen six times, or that I could carry until two days before my due-date and labor 20 hours for a dead baby. These stories frighten and horrify me and leave me up at night weeping in despair. Even if they have a happy ending, do not share these stories with me.
The scripture above is one of Peter’s famous statements–he couldn’t believe anything could get between his love and admiration of Jesus. Shortly after the intimate last supper with Jesus and the twelve disciples, the table turned and things got rough. When Jesus was arrested, Peter, out of fear, weakened and caved in, and said he didn’t know Jesus—not once, but three times. However, we need to remember that Peter was human, not divine, like his friend, Jesus.
Here's what I know for sure - sticking your head in the sand when it comes to money problems or keeping secrets is a death sentence on turning things around. Still, going PUBLIC like this is something that takes a level of courage and humility that I think few people have. My respect for Tristi went off the Richter scale as I read this book.

When a Malay man takes on a trophy wife as his second, third or fourth acquisition, he quashes any criticism of his actions by saying that it is his right under Islam. He ignores the conditions imposed for polygamy, one of them being that he must have sufficient income to support all his wives equally.
That brings us to today. The sun finally came out in Leamington, and it was much needed - I'd had a fairly shitty day at work yesterday, even with my fabulous frock on. I did manage to get out of the right side of bed this morning and put on something colourful to jolly myself along:
- We’re in the process of hiring a part-time, in-home sitter for Bram so that R can actually have dedicated time for dissertating. The young woman that we’re hiring is a talented, enthusiastic musician who is fluent in ASL. We’re so excited that she’ll sing and sign with B. Also, she’s totally happy to accommodate our attachment parenting/cloth diapering lifestyle. We’re also stoked because she’ll be coming over one evening a month so that R and I can have a genuine grown-ups date night! Yay!
Years and lifetimes have layered countless moments that take me further away from myself. Repeat lessons threading a theme.

Whether that landing is harsh and depressing or validating and sustaining depends to a certain extent on how well we've been learning and applying our Saturn lessons in the sign of the scales. That's not to say Saturn only lays its particular brand of reality-based smack-down on irresponsible n'er-do-wells. Everyone goes under its thumb at one point or another. But people who have been actively attempting to wriggle their way out of Saturn's squirm-inducing, step-by-step relationship and relating lessons will certainly be getting a reality check here as well as one last chance to get it together.
Nicolas Cage breaks out of Hell to save his baby granddaughter from Satanic sacrifice. He hooks up with a sweary, ass-kickin' Amber Heard and tries to fend off the cold determined might of William Fichtner, who has been tasked with dragging Cage back to Hell.

In my mind, further focus on the 2009 tests is about getting people in trouble, not about moving forward. If wrongdoing can be proved in a court of law, great. I hate cheaters more than just about anything else.
In a case against squatters, Judge Harold Brown commented,” It seems curious that if a landlord closes the door on a coloured applicant merely because of his colour he might well get into serious trouble. But if he closes his door on white people with children merely because they have children, he is under no penalty at all.” (Guardian, 2 August 1969.)
It seems almost precious in the modern media world. We have a media where daytime talkers and morning shows go off at length with obvious falsehoods, pounded into believable shape through continual repetition. Where political candidates will tell blatant lies, get called on them, then go off to their next speech to tell the same lies again. Where a lot of reporting is pressured by time constraints to little more than rewriting press releases and canned interviews filtered to the speaker's talking points and the audience's expectations. And here we have a passion for finding out the truth. In the wake of these revelations, there seems to be a lot of pearls being clutched by a lot of sensible souls.
All-in-all it was a great way to conclude this week of service and to answer Dr. King’s challenge in his quote, “Life’s most persisent and urgent question is: what are you doing for others?” As one of the volunteers was leaving the event, he let out a sigh and said, “Well, that was a very good start to theday!”
Ben shows up and Harry has an awesome lisp that made me want to drink with him, until he offered Ben Chardonnay, which is the bastard child of the wine world. Ben was like shit. Then it got worse, because he realized he was drinking wine out of kitschy wine glasses made out of mason jars. For a winemaker, this had to be like getting your prostate examined by a guy you aren’t sure is a doctor. I mean, you go to a nice restaurant and the waiter literally wraps a fucking napkin around the wine because it’s hard enough to pour it, let alone drinking it from a mason jar like you are running from lawmen in the 1800s. If I had a helicopter, I’d have come down and saved Ben in a bro kind of way.
She helped me become a better human being, a much more confident woman and a responsible person.

Another task I like to keep up with is de-cluttering my desktop. I often save documents there so they are easy to find (lazy, I know!!). So every few months I need to delete unwanted icons on the desktop, so I can clearly find only the ones I actually need there. I like my desktop to only have a few things on it, as I usually have a beautiful photo in the background, and I want to be able to see as much of the photo as possible :-)

Oh dear, This one's been full to the top, see the debris on the sides? Water gets away, but only at a certain rate. If the rain fall is above the rate at which the drain can soak away into the earth, this will fill, and overflow. The top of this chamber is six feet above the nearby building's floor level.

This gripped me so hard I actually lost sleep over it. Through both the reading of it and the way the psychological suspense kept swirling about in my head even when I'd lain it down to rest of an evening. It's just so utterly convincing and the storyline so compelling that I actually wanted to leap into the book and rescue the MC myself. If you've ever been in a relationship and thought 'wow - this is just TOO GOOD to be true' - then chances are, this is your gut telling you it actually MIGHT be. made me question all sorts of stuff and look at a lot of situations from a different perspective. SO good.
It is perfectly possible to find a suit which fits you well which costs under £50. However, you may need to wait some months for it to go on sale. I once was in a high street menswear store to look at their suit collection. I was wearing a suit from Primark. The store manager commented on how well my suit fit and tried to find me a suit which fit as well as the one I was already wearing. I accept that this may just have been the silver tongue of a salesman but it appears this man whose job was selling suits had a little trouble telling that I was wearing a suit that cost less than £40.
As with the existence of ghosts, I try to keep an open mind. I have no logical explanation for the psychic who predicted I’d be a writer – he really couldn’t have known. So who’s to say there aren’t people who can contact the dead? Although there are plenty unscrupulous people making the same claim and I think that’s pretty low.

I am to say the least, like everyone else, extremely disappointed by the results in Barking and Dagenham. But I hope that this will afford the Party the chance to turn a corner, because there are some things which need to be said, and unless these matters are sorted out now, once and for all, I do not see that the Party is going to progress; indeed its implosion is inevitable.

It is true the name “Jehovah’s Witnesses” was adopted at Columbus, Ohio, in 1931 when Rutherford filled in the J.W. initials, renaming what was already C. T. Russell’s movement: Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society(from Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society,) of Pennsylvania movement.

These images were taken by me a number of years ago (really bad pictures. sorry) their house was going to be featured in Country Home magazine right before it went under. I love their touches. They focus on organization and pieces that work towards that. Open shelving is everywhere. Their mostly neutral palet of Quahog paint from Martha Stewart with bright white trim makes for a calm and pleasing space. The furniture has great texture and presence. It’s not unusual for them to pull a piece of furniture from someone’s trash and refurbish it into an amazing find…These images will inspire you and get you out on trash day.

This has been an interesting week, we returned from Lyme Regis on Sunday, to find half of our allotment under water. May has been the wettest for many years, I read somewhere that last week we had a month’s worth of rain in a week and it showed; the local park and the town cricket pitch were under water and the River Tone had overflowed. Our poor old allotment looked a sorry state, the raised beds were now submerged and I thought I should be growing rice not potatoes! Thankfully the water subsided quickly and now all we have to do is remake the beds. Our other plot had escaped the flood, so things could have been worse.

We used to have a walk-in closet attached to our master bedroom, which seemed a bit of a waste of space in our little house. So we decided it would make more sense to turn it into an office instead, that is until we found out we were pregnant again. Then it made more sense to turn it into another nursery (which i'll cover in future posts). So out with the walk-in closet, in with the new nursery. This meant we needed a new place to store our clothes. Since we liked how the built in IKEA PAX closets worked out in Sidney's room, we thought we'd do it again, but with a few added features.

Now, think about your social media contacts. In the endless array of messages, whose do you pay attention to, look for?

Grace Askew isn’t waiting to get old. Metaphorically, she’s wearing purple now, and Go My Way is her declaration of independence. Askew sings in a smoky torch alto, and her voice is a powerful instrument. When I reviewed her last album, I enjoyed her jazzy blues. But her new band, Black Market Goods, pushes her to new heights. I can see now how her past work was only a warm up. Here, Askew finds new strength. The band adds some twang to the mix, and it’s all to the good. Some singers can slur their words to great effect, helping them to create a certain type of character. That was Askew’s strategy before, and I enjoyed the results. But now she is singing her words clearly, possibly so that they can be made out above the band, and this frees her. Go My Way still presents a character from a lower stratum of society, but now there is a sense of the character’s personal strength that wasn’t there before. It’s going to be a joy to see how this band develops going forward.
Great concert!

10:30 – 11:45 a.m.–America Haiku Panel – Don Eulert, who founded “American Haiku” with the late Jim Bull, Gayle Bull, and Charlie Trumbull. Jerome Cushman will moderate the panel.
I had to tell him there were swarms of “midges”.
People don't give enough credit to Gene Clark. He came up with the most incredible lyrics. . . . He was awesome! He was heads above us! Roger wrote some great songs then, but Gene was coming up with lyrics that were way beyond what he was. He wasn't a well-read man in that sense, but he would come up with these beautiful phrases. A very poetic man -- very, very productive.

I was recruited by our town Librarian to campaign for a measure that is being presented to the voters in June. This measure would renew an existing tax (1/8 of a cent) that currently provides 87% of our county's library funding. Sounds pretty important, right? I thought so too. I agreed because not only do I love to read, but my kids love to read. I feel that I can swing 1/8 of cent to fund the library and really, if the library isn't getting the money, you better believe that the government would not only refuse to give it back, they would find something else to fund with it. Maybe more private jets.
She tilts her head from side to side and lightly stomps her feet to let them know she'll be walking. This brings another round of laughter and "walaslkjhas; anneyonhigesayo anneyonheegaseyo!!!" Goodnight goodnight and I hope your headache tomorrow isn't too terrible.

Collecting patterns has been invaluable to me since I am not a professional pattern maker. I can take an existing pattern piece and tweak it and grade it, but to start from scratch is a nightmare for me. Whatever works, right?
I know, I know. It's been furefer since mama let me blog. But things have not been going well here, and we just couldn't share. We have problems with the green papers. Serious ones. Mama says there is something called Medigap which makes her upset cause it raises the price of three of her meds to unbelievable heights. So, while I have my foodies and my denties, and important things like my litter, a lot of things mama needs are not getting bought. Like her foodie budget is cut waaaayy down. Like by a lot. And she's behind on some bills. And trying to figure out how to pay for her meds. Like ones she can't live without. Like her intsulins. And there definitely is NO hamm pizza. Sigh. And no camera (now, that can't be so bad, huh?)
The Confusing:
Breaking out of that shell and spreading your wings for the first time. Letting the breeze dry off the moisture left from all that hard work inside the cocoon. Seeing your true colors as you are free to fly about and drink in those vibrant blooms! What could possibly be wrong with that picture.? Nothing in my book - except for the heartbreaking fact that butterflies live 2-6 weeks. So I'd like my metamorphosis in human terms, please - with staying power.

Fortunately, some concerned citizens formed a corporation dedicating to saving and restoring the old lady. The group raised hundreds of thousands of dollars on its own, and after other loans and contributions had been made, it soon had a couple million dollars to spend on a renovation. In 1970 the hotel was designated as a State and National Landmark.

Large Texas counties and the states have dropped out of the market as customers for private prison bed services, wrote Dennis, but the federal Bureau of Prisons remains a potential customer with seemingly limitless growth potential (mostly, she failed to add, because of immigration detention). "Federal Bureau of Prisons Spokesman Ed Reed said the agency had a steady increase in prisoners each year for the past few decades. The agency will soon open new facilities this year to handle the growing prison population, including a 1,280 bed medium-security prison in Berlin, N.H."

In Britain, on instructions from the CIA, secret courts are to deal with “terror suspects”. Habeas Corpus is dying. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that five men, including three British citizens, can be extradited to the US even though none except one has been charged with a crime. All have been imprisoned for years under the 2003 US/UK Extradition Treaty which was signed one month after the criminal invasion of Iraq. The European Court had condemned the treaty as likely to lead to “cruel and unusual punishment”. One of the men, Babar Ahmad, was awarded 63,000 pounds compensation for 73 recorded injuries he sustained in the custody of the Metropolitan Police. Sexual abuse, the signature of fascism, was high on the list. Another man is a schizophrenic who has suffered a complete mental collapse and is in Broadmoor secure hospital; another is a suicide risk. To the Land of the Free, they go – along with young Richard O’Dwyer, who faces 10 years in shackles and an orange jump suit because he allegedly infringed US copyright on the internet.
The Kuril Islands are located in Russia’s Sakhalin Oblast region and stretch approximately 1,300 km (810 miles) northeast from Hokkaidō, Japan, to Kamchatka, Russia, separating the Sea of Okhotsk from the North Pacific Ocean. There are 56 islands and many more minor rocks. It consists of Greater Kuril Ridge and Lesser Kuril Ridge, all of which were captured by Soviet Forces in the closing days of World War II from the Japanese.
The type of agreement selected will determine who or what will own the life insurance. Buy-sell agreements also can be set up to allow the business owners to accumulate funds in a tax-deferred permanent life insurance policy. But selecting the proper agreement and determining whether the owners or some other entity should own the life insurance policies becomes more complicated. This article explains how to simplify the process and meet each business owner’s objectives.

The city daily photo concept was started by journalist Eric Tenin of Paris in March, 2005 with Paris Daily Photo. The original idea was to show a daily slice of life in Paris. The idea spread to now include hundreds of cities worldwide. The idea is a noble one, however, most readers do not want to be privy all the mundane chores of everyday living, so Eric's site, like most of the others, show a side of daily life of interest to outsiders which includes a spectrum of the more known to lesser known.
It’s completely the same.
In fact, we see that this bread is offered continually by Aaron. It is a holy offering to the Lord in sacrifice that Aaron and his sons are to eat in what is called a holy place. This is part of a lasting covenantal meal. Thus, this sacrificial offering to God is a holy meal. The parallels of this sacrifice to the New Covenant meal is striking. In the Catholic Church the Body and Blood of Christ are of course much more holy, but the fact that the holiness is stressed in even this sacrificial Old Testament meal is striking. Of course as we saw in 1 Corinthians 11, if one eats unworthily, one is profaning the actual Body and Blood of Christ. The offering in the New Covenant of course far surpasses that of the Old Covenant. We also see that on every Sabbath this bread that is a sacrificial offering is a covenantal offering to God. In the New Covenant, the Eucharist is a covenantal offering to God. This covenantal offering to God is celebrated every Sunday in the New Covenant: Acts 20:7: On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the morrow; and he prolonged his speech
Lately I've noticed that my son seems really interested in the different textures of his food. I've seen him squeeze birthday cake, yogurt, and bananas through his little fingers, and he seemed delighted by the texture. Without a doubt, I figured he was ready for play dough.

While I am not on a weight loss journey myself, I thought it was important to always be looking for ways to improve my quality of life. I made a commitment to reduce the amount of supermarket and “instant” produce I consumed. Ive been making a conscious effort to visit the market first (for my fresh produce – mostly organic), or make items myself (breads, soups, stocks, sauce) to reduce the amount of synthetics I am consuming as well as increase the nutrient value in my food every day without needing a complete diet overhaul. Ive shunned my microwave and returned to slow cooking, and Im switching to “clean” recipes that dont require artificial foods.
The main problem with dishes is that sinks have other uses rather than dish holder. Since we have no dish washer (other than me) they generally just sit there and gather mold in the moist costal air of Humboldt County. Unfortunately, a full sink holds about a half of our total dishes, so even when it’s full, people can still access clean stuff to plaster their grease on, and put off doing the dishes for one more day.
This is not a telephone or Internet session. All you do is just relax and sit or lie down during the session and pay attention to what is happening in your body. Because there will be many people in the session, I please ask that you don't email or call to join. I wouldn't be able to handle all the email unless it is done this way. You join simply by using your intention after reading this email. Also because this will be a big group I won't be able to answer questions before the session and I'll give the details you will need in this email. Please feel free to email me your experiences after the session is over.
Teams have known for a long time that stalling the rear wing drastically reduces downforce and as a result reduces drag. This is because the large flow structures coming off the wing break up and shed the drag inducing effect they have. Many teams have tried to exploit the rules by flexing their rear wings to create just such an effect, but the FIA has outlawed this via a number of deflection tests and latterly the slot gap separator.
Forest City does have some good news to report regarding CBA compliance; cumulative employment of minorities is 41%, while employment for women is 3%.
Get OUT! Are you kidding me?!! I began making excuses about having spent most of the 7 days out shopping, or at the printer. I haven't been cooking, so hadn't had to put pots or pans away. My head was somewhere else. Oh, and we were at a wedding all day Saturday night, and ummm...and whatever other excuse I could dream up.

As in the wind they sway,
My exercise will fall into place, I made sure of that by buying some lights for my bike which extends the times when I can ride but the exercise is not as important as one trying to lose weight might think. I believe that diet is the crucial part of weight loss/physical gain and I am not doing my part, I know this and yet grabbing it by its throat to throw it to the ground has eluded me in the past more than a few months. My weight is up, some might say significantly some might argue that its not all that significant, its more than just a couple pounds but I am still close to 200 pounds lost as I type this as a reference point and I am going to make this post the beginning of the end, the end of this not paying attention to my intake thing that's happening right now.

Yes, 2012 data can be compared with 2011 data. ABC still recommends, however, not making direct comparisons to data from 2010 and earlier. Keep in mind that you must use common figures when comparing one newspaper’s circulation to that of another newspaper. I explain more about publicity rules in this post.

Padre Quadrupani observes: “The attraction of the feelings towards the object presented by the imagination is at times so strong that the will seems to have been carried away and overcome by a sort of fascination. This, however, is not the case. The will suffered, but did not consent; it was attacked and wounded, but not conquered. This state of things coincides with what St. Paul says of the revolt of the flesh against the spirit and of their unceasing warfare. The soul, indeed, experiences strange sensations, but as she does not consent to them, she passes through the ordeal unsullied, just as substances coated with oil may be immersed in water without absorbing a single drop of it.”
If I hold a certain belief and am imprisoned for holding it, I do not consider that imprisonment as suffering, because the belief is really mine. Suppose I believe in something – something not external, something that is real to me; if I am punished for holding that belief, I will not consider that punishment as suffering, for the belief I am being punished for is to me not merely a belief, but a reality.

At first, I was doing a lot of work with updating the Facebook page, connecting to the business that does their email newsletters, and creating a Twitter page for them. I also began working on writing material for Nimbash, their annual fundraising event that drives the work that happens most of the year. I began attending their events to photograph the people and the art and even got a couple of pictures published in the St. Helena Star.

The antithesis to my Meyer lime syrup. I made a rangpur lime syrup, and I never want to live without it again. But I will, sadly. I made a simple syrup with 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of water, that I brought to a simmer to make sure the sugar was dissolved. Then, once it cooled a touch, I added one cup of rangpur lime juice. Did I mention that rangpur limes are heaven with gin? Oops. Maybe I said that already. Have you tried Tanqueray Rangpur? I haven't. (Hint, hint, Tanqueray publicity!)

Bel0w: A little slideshow of the pencils, inks and finished colors.
I was with President Kimball once some years ago when, in a small group, he told the story of his courtship and marriage to Camilla Eyring. They only knew one another for a short time. I'm even hesitant to say how short the time was before their marriage. He told of meeting this beautiful young schoolteacher who had come to the community, and in the course of a few weeks they were married. After hearing this, one young man in the group later said, "Well, if President Kimball can find somebody and be sure in that short of a time, I guess I can do that."
“Good girl now shush up.” He lifted a finger to his lips, Kathy joined him in agreement. “Brave girl. Nice meeting you Kathy and you too Andy.” Mattie watched the girl pull a teddy bear from thin air, she reached below her seat where nothing had been but dark space, pulling free a much-needed comfort from nowhere. Another stab and the odor of earth and perfumed ghost chattering its teeth made her want nothing more than to have intrusive Jack the Grant Distributor back in his seat. Mattie's mouth felt like it was turning to putty and pulling down, her eyes willfully sealed shut for a second then snapped open with Jack exactly where she wanted him, her hand once again wrapped in his.

“Where a book might be written over the course of years, a blog entry is written in an hour or so and presented to the public warts and all. Where generally responses to a book are very slow to come, responses to a blog entry can be very quick and ongoing. As a consequence, internet philosophizing tends to lead to a very quick evolution of thought where positions change rapidly. Perhaps this calls for a new sort of philosophy, where one doesn’t so much embody a fixed position as engage in a developing tendency of thought not unlike the evolution of a species over time.”
And with that he was off.

inspiration room that is challenge this week over on PaperCraft Star Challenge 25. This Oxford Impressions image is perfect for the tree, don't you think? I stamped it on a very pale blue with VersaFine Olympic Green and then fussy cut. The room was roughly created with 'moulding' and flooring (cut from a piece of wood wallpaper). The window, Stamp Francisco, inked on velum with Adirondack Snow Cap and embossed with clear ep. The gifts under the tree are from the long retired Basic Grey Figgy Pudding sheet that was all presents. The Ways to Use it Challenge on SCS today was to used Glitter. I added Stickles in three shades to the ornaments on the tree and a brass charm for the star at the very top. The Merry Christmas is inked with ChalkBox Warm Red. And a bit of twill in robins' egg blue.

A scream in an empty store can pierce your eardrum. This was the banshee screech from a woman who ran up the stairs at Century 21. “A plane hit the World Trade Center,” I was told by a clerk who just shrugged. I left immediately, looking up just once from St. Paul's cemetery as I made quick passage to my office building.
On July 9th, 2010, Gioconda became the only woman to have won the prestigious Latin American Prize: La Otra Orilla (The other side), which carries a 100,000 dollars award. Her winning novel: A Women’s Country (El País de las Mujeres) is the story of five women who decide to create a party to make fun of power as exercised by men. Using terms like sweeping, washing, associated with domestic chores, they promise to do a “spring cleaning” of their country and to change it by applying a new kind of feminism that they call: happyism

But March isn’t just about F1. Le Mans cars will only now be gearing up for some good and proper thrashing around the test tracks, in preparation for the annual slog in July. Le Mans is a treat for the eyes, the ears, the heart, the mind, all of it. This year, everything’s full of hybrid/electric/kinetic-powered/voodoo witchcraft/space-age wizardy. I’m quite sure that teams are permitted to cast magic spells and summon dragons during pit stops. Audi have announced two mental cars for this year’s competition (no need to bring up last year’s crashes, mmkay). That’s lovely and all.
Cardiac Arrest's fourth full-length Vortex of Violence is another grind soaked slab of old school death metal that wisely decides to stay clear of the current, prevalent trends in the medium and carve its own course into the nostalgia of its potential (and pre-installed) audience. You won't hear any of the gaping, cavernous death/doom chasms so popular, or the knockbacks to Sweden in the early 90s, or even a heavy Floridian influence. I'm sure the quartet is well schooled in all these areas, and yet the sound they settle upon is more one of social and psychological unrest once spewed by the death/grind pioneers like Repulsion, Napalm Death or the faster-paced tunes of British war-masters Bolt Thrower or Benediction.

It drives me bonkers not only because I am impatient (this is a fatal flaw, but at least I am aware of it), but because I don’t even understand the insanity. Everyone is gesticulating and discoursing, going around and around and around, and I can only catch every sixth word or so. In other words, what’s the point of my even being there? Except to try to understand, if not the conversation, then the French ways.

Talk about a perfect circle. I had a stomach attack at my parents house this weekend. Actually, it was one of the worst ones I have ever had. They insisted at 3:30 in the morning that we go to the ER. 17 years ago, when I still lived in their house and still was a dependent, and still relied on mostly them telling me what to do, I complained but agreed when they took me to the emergency room. And Saturday, I did the same.

The next day was Saturday/Pageant day! I had a State Director's meeting Saturday morning so the boys explored the hotel for a few hours. After that we met the rest of the MN crew in Florida for a quick lunch. We only had a few hours between lunch and show time so we headed to the pool to cool off and tried to let Cooper nap. About the napping....
Schlussel was a fine malty beer although it had slightly too much carbonation for my taste. The two I preferred though, and was quite suprised about, were Fuchsen and Schumacher. Both had a wonderful hoppiness which I wasn't expecting in an Alt. Fuchsen was as foxy as its name suggests, and luckily Schumacher did not attempt to force me out of my chair with a late breaking maneouvre or sudden jab on the steering wheel. Neither did it almost break my neck whilst leaping at me after madly charging out of its goal.

Slowly the sun shone out from among the dark and stormy clouds. I think it was my faith in God that provided the ultimate break through.

In the oven, the bread becomes so crunchy. This contrasted perfectly with the creamy warm avocado and juicy tomatoes. Also, I'm a huge fan of olives. I can down those little lovers like none other. So instead of buying pre-chopped olives, I just purchased a can of whole olives (less expensive) and sliced them up. This recipe only calls for 1/2 cup olives, so you can probably guess where the rest of the can ended up.

I’ve kept up with the current version, updated and straining to be more adult, but weighed down by sentiment and the vast history of the series. The acting could be very strong, with some good doses of just over the top. David Tennant and Catherine Tate especially brought a great interplay, but the sense of wonder had largely gone out of it for me. Still, I decided to follow the current season from the beginning, driven mostly by my affection for Steven Moffat.

Just for the record, this image is not edited or retouched in any way. That is really what the sunrises look like here. That strange sort of half-rainbow thing doesn't last very long, and it's actually harder to see with the naked eye then with the camera. But it sort of moves across the sky over the course of a couple minutes, we only get it when the sun is at just that right angle behind the glacier.
The Italian sonnet is, like the English, 14 lines in number. However, it is structured slightly differently. Instead of three quatrains followed by a rhyming couplet, it consists of an octave, which describes a problem, and a sestet, which resolves it.

Let me first just say that these pictures are a big deal! We have been trying since September to get decent photos of the triplets and each time, something has gone wrong. Orginally, I had set up with another mother of multiples and photographer who had offered to take photographs of the kids for an outdoor shoot, but each time would be cancelled due to bad weather. By November, we were ready to try again and the kids were all sick as dogs so no such luck then either. In December, we thought we'd take them to a studio place just to get some shots for the holidays but then we had a blizzard on the day I scheduled to go and never made it back because of all the hectic holiday stuff going on.
I figured I’d drop this here as an addendum to my prior post on dystopia. Like the definition there, this is one my students and I co-wrote based on my lecture comments on genre characteristics and reading an excerpt from More’s Utopia (Book 2, obviously). I wanted us to come up with a definition because those online and in lit. terms books were not particularly good (to put it kindly). However, it could still use some revision. Also, one of the most useful discussions of the problems of defining utopia is found in the introduction to Lyman Tower Sargent’s British and American Utopian Literature: 1516-1975.

Lastly, the game’s final plot twist is random and ineffective, and I’m honestly shocked at how many praised it. Plot twists are supposed to make you reconsider what you thought occurred, to have you reinterpret events with new insight—this plot turn does not. Slight spoiler warning, but I want to pose this question: Why did Joker even need this red-herring to “get the drop” on Batman? It seemed like he could’ve done fine without it. And perhaps I missed something, but why didn’t he just drink the cure when he had it in his possession? While the final fate of the Joker was pretty well done, this abrupt and unnecessary turn dampened its shine.

Welcome back to the Digi Days Challenge. Wow hasn't the weather in the UK been awful this week so we were cheered up immensely by visiting your blogs and seeing even more April Showers!! Our winner and Top 3 can be found at the bottom of this post so do read on to check if you are one of the lucky winners.

Speaking of icky complications, Ben has finally succumbed to the stomach bug and has been doing the required tossing of cookies and running of fever and lying about involved with said bug. I maintain hope that it will yet pass me by. Like many people, I harbor a huge aversion to throwing up. I don't care if I will feel better right after, I don't like the right before or the during. That's a 2/3 majority for dislike.
I woke up this morning determined that today was going to be better if it killed me. I made a card for Bug last night with some cat stickers and a sappy, cheerful message inside and left it at her place on the table. I fixed yogurt sundaes for breakfast. Honestly, no one can be uncheered by yogurt sundaes. I pulled out all the stops: French vanilla yogurt layered with fresh strawberries, granola, another layer of yogurt, sliced bananas, whipped cream, drizzled with homemade strawberry glaze (left over from the cheesecake the other night), and a cherry on top, served in a glass wine goblet. It worked. The kids were bobbing up and down and smiling, reminding me of Bill Cosby's chocolate cake for breakfast routine. "Mom is great/Gives us yogurt sundaes..."
I think I've had my fill of experimenting at Perbacco. If I do visit again, I'll have a much easier time deciding - Salumi, a tasty sounding appetizer and a small Tajarin. I can't almost guarantee that's the only combination that will ensure I'm 100% satisfied.

In case you're not sure what a CSA is, it stands for Community Supported Agriculture. It's the idea that a group of people will "subscribe" to a small farm and pay them for a share of whatever that farm produces on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis. Most CSAs provide vegetables, and sometimes meat, but Essex Farm produces its own flour, grains, three kinds of meat, over fifty kinds of vegetables, eggs, milk, and even soap!
I’m joining in (a bit late) with Blogging through the Alphabet with Marcy from “Ben and Me.”
Anyway, yesterday he was out running through Greenwich in his lunch break when 3 guys started taunting him. It happens - don't ask me why. Only these particular dregs sprinted to run alongside him. And when they didn't get any response to their abuse, one of them kicked him. Hard. Being G, he didn't so much as stumble. He carried on running and very soon they were unable to keep up with him.

She said the military’s efforts to deal with the complications of women in the ranks, which have been around for years, as well as the new issues of open homosexuality, are failing.
OK, on to my point: I was pondering the verse in which Christ says, “anyone who wishes to follow me must deny him or herself, and take up his or her cross, and follow me.” And I realized how that verse has been misused to make people believe that they are meant to deny their identity, their very nature or self! That if you are going to be a Christian, you have to get over your SELF, who you really are, because otherwise God can’t accept you.
The house is freezing! Not a good season to be going away. I'll switch on all the computers to try and warm the place up a bit. Okay, I'm keen to get back to my Murder Mystery (with robots) story, because I tried out the first 1000 words on my writers' group on Friday night, convinced I'd have them all baffled. Straight away one of them said, "Did XXX do it?"
I won’t talk much about my call center life since I’ll make that the topic of a future ‘confessions of a teacher’. Suffice to say, I couldn’t imagine myself doing that kind of work much longer.

3. Instant gratification A third problem for FSBOs is that people who surf the Web usually are seeking instant gratification. In fact, most visitors will only visit a website once and stay for 15-30 seconds. If the FSBO has no strategy for capturing the lead’s contact information or for immediately following up, the lead moves on to the next website. Even if the Web lead does contact the FSBO, unless the buyer gets back to the FSBO quickly, that lead is gone.
I'm not sure if I'll know the athletes in here, but the set is relatively small at 100 cards, so chances are pretty good I'll know someone.

Our book shelf is decorated with a vivid display of creatures collected around our garden and from many field trips. The locations of said field trips are usually smelly, muddy, boggy drains that contain ‘great’ scientific specimens….just so you know, that strange man splashing in the drain with a net has nothing to do with us….. and that is not me trying to hide in the car………
Dr. Snyderman concludes her diatribe by focusing on her own fears, while wistfully clinging to the myth that vaccines will eradicate all infectious diseases in America - if only every man, woman and child would dutifully comply with doctors’ orders to “get vaccinated.”
ALL the DD bras I've looked at for the last couple of years have been PADDED. Now while this may be highly desirable if you have smaller boobs, I don't know one single DD+ lady who is looking for MORE. The only way to get an unpadded bra is to order on-line (expensive) or go to a specialist shop (also expensive)
In fact, I was taking the rest, gathering it all up in my arms, and trying to cram it into every little nook and cranny of time and mind that I could find. Exhausting carrying all that extra load. It had to stop.

So just think of me and send a good wish.
But the band knew. Musicians know. I should finally and even though it’s far too late to do me much good, stand up and be proud of playing the bass well. It’s something that suits me and comes naturally to me, and if I had followed that route with my whole heart I would likely have played out a LOT more. And if I want to play out again, I should consider it. I need some better gear though if I’m going to do that. I have an Ampeg B2 head, gathering dust under my VCR. But I don’t have room in my place for a decent cabinet and I don’t (horrors!) have a decent P-Bass. I’m always telling Steph that P-Bass + an Ampeg amp = definitive rock bass sound. You know. I love the classics.
After these many years and numerous theorems and derivations I would prefer the simple lesson, those rites, of you teaching me how to shave that first time, tying a tie that first time.
My sweet, sweet husband hopped in the canoe one afternoon while I was out and rescued some of those perfectly weathered boards.

90. Have you ever strongly identified with a different country/culture than your own? - I love Scotland with the intense passion of a Highland Jacobite, yet I'm a thirteenth-generation French Acadian. I did grow up in Nova Scotia, and there is a heavy Celtic influence here. But not enough to explain my obsession with all things Scottish. The Scandinavian countries come up second. I think Nordic faces are mesmerizingly beautiful, and I really love listening to Swedish, Danish and Norwegian speakers. The folk art from there is a big favorite.

My first full day in Berlin had begun well, after a nice breakfast I took a taxi to the photography rental shop that would be supplying my lighting for the shoot. Everything went smoothly bar a little rejigging of bags as the chap serving me struggled to put everything into manageable parcels. Struggled he may have but succeed he did not, in neither respect. The bags were not manageable nor did they have everything in, as I was later to discover.

He is a chunker! lol! He is on room air, they haven't started feeds yet but has an ng tube in place for meds (he is only on 2). He is very, very stiff and tremors a lot :( . He opened his eyes quite a few times and was pretty alert when he did.
I slept 2 hours a night and that was only if my dad didn’t need me to guard the henhouse or stand in the cornfield with a straw hat on. We worked ‘til we dropped. And when the dizziness and disorientation set in, we drank black coffee by the jug and slapped each other repeatedly across the face. It was decent and right and made for a better America.
Every single bit of Emily and Shane’s wedding was made with love, love and more love. From the hand-sewn pennants her mom made to the beautiful cupcakes a friend made to the beer her dad made. Everywhere I looked, there were more sweet details from people who loved them.
I had the colors for the kit picked out from something I saw on the WWW somewhere, but I didn't know what I wanted to make with them. They spoke "country" to me, but that was about the only idea I had.
Once again, we’ve moved. Again. Yes, again. And it won’t be the last time. Yuck. But as I have been reminded, every move is an adventure and just makes life that much more interesting. Right? I hope so.

Now, I completely understand if you aren't a background person - but this is pure bliss to me. I love just playing around and I encourage you to give it a try. You don't always end up with a winner (as the first 3 tries of this prove...) but you might come up with something you love. (Plus, don't you wonder what a pattern like this would look like in Christmas colors?)
A year ago today our hearts didn't know the capacity it had to love something so small so much.

Now when you're going from super long to super short you really need to have someone who knows what they're doing for the cut and style. That's why I started looking into different salons and spas in the Valley of the Sun. Then I found Dolce Salon & Spa, which not only does Locks of Love cuts, but is also complimentary if you have a qualifying donation. They even have a facebook photo album of people who donate. Look at this cute little girl...

In case you missed it, the headline of the Reuters report this week here says it all: "Microsoft trumps Amazon, others for AOL patents." For the sum of more than $1 billion AOL, a once-dominant internet platform, has agreed to sell most of its patent portfolio, more than 800 patents in all, to Microsoft. This is reported to amount to more than $1.3 million per issued patent (this when, in the words of a Clayton Moran, a well-known analyst, "Investors had anticipated little to no value for the portfolio -- a few hundred million at the most.") The acquired patents are said to cover various AOL businesses, including Netscape, ICQ, Mapquest, CompuServe and Advertising.com (in truth, most of these companies are either "past tense", or marginal players in the current high tech world).

Places that exhibit a strong sense of place have an identity and character recognized immediately by a visitor and valued deeply by residents. New Mexico is such a place, with long history and traditions of family that go years back. Northern New Mexico is known for it's old churches, which help to keep the traditions over time. The oldest church in the US is here in Santa Fe, and the oldest house is also in Santa Fe. It is a land so beautiful, it is known as the "land of enchantment."

Bruno said he loved every minute of it. Carrie Ann thanked hime on behalf of all women for doing a lovely rumba – but said it wasn’t his best dance and she wanted to see more dancing. Len was not impressed saying it was on the raunchy side and he wanted to see more forward and back hip action not just side to side.
Morgan spent her day in a way likely quite a bit different then most other kids her age. She went with me to take Nathan to feeding therapy. She spent most of the ride up there discussing and brainstorming things we can do at home to work on Peter's sensory issues and make more neuro connections in the areas of his brain that are damaged. We talk a lot about things like this- it interests her because she wants to be a special education teacher and realizes she is getting real life, hands on experience every single day right now. Then she sat in the big therapy waiting room waiting for Nathan's therapist to come get us, surrounded by parents and kids with various special needs...completely comfortable. I know many people are not comfortable being at the children's hospital...but for us, it is becoming very comfortable. I trust this girl....to look at hurting or disabled children with eyes filled with compassion and thoughtfulness. She would not avert her eyes or pretend they are not there....she would greet them with a smile when the situation arises.
In my view, this sequence of facts represents a real, clear example of breach of public duty and breach of the ministerial oath of office. By her very own words Nunez-Tesheira was informed and believed that the group had problems, as a result of which, she took the necessary steps to protect her own family’s financial position. Following that, the then Minister was officially advised that the CL Financial difficulties were now going to be requiring a State bailout at which stage she took official steps to deal with the crisis.

I got out of the first diaper change. SCORE! That's what having two grandmas around gets you! In fact, I didn't have to change a diaper until the very last day when we were checking out. The nurses did it at night, and visitors clamored to do it during the day. The funny thing is, I don't mind changing diapers. I would have happily done it. But I'll take the help!
I have also been at Orchard working on Rainbow Magic for 10 weeks now, but my colleagues have assured me I am not yet turning into a fairy. If the process did take place, it would have to be quite a lengthy one, as the difference between me and a fairy is quite marked. Diversity is strength, anyway.

That bring us, at long last, to the Jim Balent, the iconic look released on the cover of Catwoman #1. This costume drew upon the Classic Skirted Original, obviously, updating it for a more modern flavor while retaining all that connected Catwoman to her Bob Kane, Batman #1 roots.
When I read the list of books for The Morning News Tournament of Books, 2012, I immediately went out to my library's website and added them all (nearly ALL, seriously) to my library holds list.

License to Ill. Ah the 80′s. Robert Downey Jr. showed the horrors of life imitating art in Less than Zero. Gordon Gekko rhapsodized creepily about the benefits of greed (and Brylcreem, no doubt) in Wall Street. And a trio of misfits from the Big Apple implored us to fight for our right to party. Of course, their bacchanalian themes went completely over my Toledo Mudhens hat-wearing 6th grade head. In my world, the implications were far more innocuous: your popularity was defined in large part by your ability to recite “Paul Revere” by heart.
The later also used Robert as one of the main characters as a rock heroe in his novel "The Lonely Boys2.

Both singles are now released also on CD alltough in other versions.

However, a major problem with these guidelines is that, all too often, they are presented not as an ideal but as an absolute upper limit, above which the drinker falls off a cliff of risk. In fact, as pointed out by CAMRA in their submission to the inquiry, even taking the figures at face value, you need to exceed them by a considerable margin before there is anything more than a slight increase in the risk level. There is a wide gap between the recommended limit and the point where drinking is likely to have a severe health impact.

In conclusion – and here I’m addressing the BWA / Brit Writers directly – your current non-disclosure of information is, in my view, causing legitimate concern amongst the community of new writers. We will always vigorously champion any organisation or initiative which helps the new writer. I hope we can champion you. But at present we need some answers. I invite you to supply them.Hopefully the BWA will respond.

I like the way Lowell addresses the flowers themselves. Much of his phraseology is rich: “fringing the dusty road with harmless gold,” for instance. The metaphor of children as “high-hearted buccaneers” who find “an Eldorado in the grass” which surpasses in some way even the gold found by the Spanish is interesting and fun. The poem is enriched by Lowell’s reference to his own childhood, and is given a deeper meaning as he draws a lesson from the value of the “common flower” at the end of the poem.

No such party exists. But if, as seems increasingly likely, the utter pricks at the top of the Tory Party miss the open goal, then I will bet you a pint of Wadworth's 6X and a pork pie that such a party will be created. And it will transpire because the Right half of the Tory party and UKIP will create something that will immediately appeal to 30% of British voters and might, if well run, be at 35% for a 2014 election. If it appeals to those who have not voted since 1992, then make it 40%.

As the call for change was highly audible before the start of election 2010 period, many Filipinos expect some changes on the way we conduct our elections. I personally expect that we shall actively discuss on platforms rather than personal issues; that we will tackle more on real social issues rather than the usual mudslinging and personality assassination.

This phenomenon has now been described for us by the former editor of Petroleum Review, Chris Skrebowski, in his piece "A Brief Economic Explanation of Peak Oil." Skrebowski believes there is a sort of speed limit that oil prices are imposing on the economy, and it begins roughly when oil trades above $90 a barrel though the number may be higher for high-growth countries such as China, perhaps up to $110. If prices stay in this area for long, it appears to signal that a recession is not far away.
Bit #2: I will briefly be in the UK in the middle of June. I'll be doing things like the Hay Festival.

The calendar says that, there is a year intersection when the sun would reach its solstice on December 21 and would occur in the year (in relation to our Gregorian calendar) of A.D. 2012. This happened last on August 11, 3114 B.C. The Mayans suggested that this moment in the past could have initiated the creation of the world. So they are suggesting, that on December 21st, 2012, we’d see an end and a new beginning of a cycle.

I spent many of the intervening years between 1987 and 2007 working part-time in bookstores belonging to various chains. Besides the hefty discounts, we also had borrowing privileges, which I made liberal use of. I developed a bad habit of buying books the day they hit the market (called a “street date”). As intended, the more reading I did, the better I was at selling books. “Oh, you like this? Then you’ll love. . .XYZ.”

For the last year, it has become a regular practice for Mary and I to meet on Mondays to map out our plans and/or finish projects together. Yesterday we met at the sparrow house to go over our business plan for our new shop. Just as we were leaving and locking the door, we heard a sort of crashie sound. The high winds yesterday caused a large limb to fall partly on the car behind ours. Being the good neighbors that we are, we removed the limb from the car and noticed how beautiful it was. (the limb, not the car). Never ones to turn down a gift, we agreed that it would be perfect for the shop, so into Mary's station wagon it went. It is perfect for our color scheme and style that we want. Also, notice our freshly painted walls. We love the way things are coming together. We feel it's a good sign!

The next and final day saw us boarding the Black Samurai from Mackay. The Black Samurai was popular with game fishermen and was usually chartered for long offshore trips (overnight-five day charters). Fortunately for us Tourism Queensland scored us a day gig but little did we know; it cost them $4,500. The plan was to hit the closest reef to the marina to chase pelagics such as Spanish mackerel and tuna… no mackerel and only one tuna! The bad luck just kept rolling on. Ben ‘Best job in the world’ Southall scored a nice barracuda but the fun ended there. We tried bottom bashing with handlines (God I hate these things) in 25 metres of water and before we could pull up any fish they would get eaten by sharks – they were ravenous! I managed to get a batfish up but that was it; he didn’t release too well and probably became shark food in the end anyway…

Claire Lyons was an innocent, frightened girl on her wedding day, seeking chaste comfort from a childhood friend. Now, years later, she has blossomed magnificently and has returned to London with one goal in mind: the seduction of her notorious husband. Unskilled in the sensual arts, she burns nonetheless for the kisses too long denied her. And she has but one Season to win back the heart of the rogue she betrayed.
The glory of Christ may others see who Christ Jesus is, and let them do understand what it means to be in the image of God, what we all are or should be. therefore it may be nice to see, even when others do not like it, that certain pastors, after a few years may come to the truth and reflect on it like TD Jakes Breaks Down the Trinity, Addresses Being Called a ‘Heretic’ By Nicola Menzie (trinityspeaks.wordpress.com). Bishop T.D. Jakes, pastor of The Potter’s House megachurch in Dallas, Texas, was put on the spot during a theological roundtable and let others know that Paul is not a modalist, but he does not think it is robbery to the divinity of God to say God was ‘manifest’ in the flesh.
So very often it is a book from the paperback pile that I will choose, and the Kindle books stay unread unless I am going on a long-haul flight. After all, most of my reading is done at home, and when I am packing to go on a short trip, my choosing is done at home.
So next time a Protestant says we “worship” Mary, ask them how they mean and explain the distinction. Worship does not necessarily mean adoration, which NO one can give to Mary.

In Hofstede’s dimensions of culture, cultural norms play a large part in the mechanics and interpersonal relationships at work, so that management skills are culturally specific. Norms of behavior – reactions, preferences, and feelings – are taken for granted, so that a management technique or philosophy that is appropriate in one national culture is not necessarily appropriate in another. Since social behavior is embedded in a particular context, and is connected to other values, the stakes are high for mismanaging cultural differences. Ignoring or mishandling differences can mean alienating employees, misreading alliances, and failed business relationships. Mismanaging cultural differences can render otherwise successful managers and organizations ineffective when working across cultures.

Whaaaaaaahooooooooooo................ I will soon be a published writer! Sorry about the slow lead-up. I'm also writing a book about how I drive everyone crazy. It's actually been pretty easy to write. Okay, let's get back to reality........ Wait a minute. The heck with reality. This world is a tough enough place. We need to take a few minutes to enjoy the rare and precious moments of glory or happiness that somehow manages to come our way. Yeaaaah! I guess that's enough celebration. It's not like I just won a Pulitzer or the Nobel prize for literature.

Make no mistake, Roland can try to spin that tweet anyway he wants. That was absolutely an insinuation that if anyone was at your Super Bowl party and thought that David Beckham’s ad, slightly made you want to buy a pair of his underwear, you needed to, figuratively, get smacked up. Why? Because you were showing attraction to a man in his drawers, and would be considered as acting “gay.”

Kanika, a resident of Elk Grove, took up art later in life as a means of exploring her heritage. "In the 1970s, when I was in my 20s, I was searching for my identity," Kanika said. "I'm very fair-skinned, so I didn't fit well into either the black or white cultures." At about that time, Kanika read Alex Haley's epic novel "Roots," which told the story of Haley's African and African-American ancestors.

All of these are pretty problematic implications, all stemming from this one amendment. But the truly horrifying thing is that it IS the 30th state to adopt such policies. We live in an America that refuses to realize that Americans are Americans are Americans.
This was churches task throughout the church age. They were to (faithfully) keep the doorway to heaven (i.e. rightly keep the teachings of the Bible).
The magic of the photographs within photographs is immediately obvious; viewers get to see how much has changed within the span of time, and those in the pictures get a priceless feeling of nostalgia.This after all is the purpose of taking pictures nowadays, to preserve a moment in time for all of eternity.
How many times have I heard those words, "an orphan ministry." As if somehow orphan care takes second place to everything else Christians are supposed to be doing.
Imitating the status quo, for example, is not a good idea; there are plenty of reasons for that, some of which we’ll be discussing down the road a bit, but the dubious value of copying the mores of a society that in practice treats shopping for products as the highest reach of human potential will probably be evident to most of my readers. What defines the modern industrial world, from this perspective, is a mode of life dominated by absurd material extravagance. What’s the opposite of that? A mode of life dominated by bitter material insufficiency—that is to say, the kind of society we may yet end up with, if the delusions of infinite material growth continue to guide our collective policy for too much longer: a society in which early death by starvation, exposure, and treatable disease is the fate of most people, because the resources that might have prevented that outcome were squandered on the senseless wastefulness of previous decades.
Still, the intellectual assent and emotional exaltation of the worshipper in the presence of the holy are not required to give the effect we’re discussing its power. The contemplation effect is remarkably independent of the other activities of the mind, and in particular, it works regardless of the thoughts and feelings you associate with the object of contemplation. One of the more bitterly ironic narratives in recent American history shows this independence in action.

Given that involuntary transparency, some people have begun to respond to their lack of privacy in interesting and unintended ways. Because they know people are watching, far from being intimidated by that prospect, it has become a platform. They are making their lives a consistent and public statement of their values and what they hold to be true. They are having their say in uninhibited ways because they know that their identity is everywhere and that it might as well be authentic, rather than dressed up to win the favour of the authorities, their peers and their employers. They are standing up for what they believe.

It seems in some way rather ironic that, to “achieve efficiencies”, the Chief Operating Officer and the Director of Football are the first to leave. Whilst D&P can step into the role that was Mr Russell’s, the day to day running of the Club, one wonders who, if anyone, is to take over the Director of Football role.

Well, I used to have a Capital One credit card. Now I leave it at home because, after seeing the newest contract terms you’ve sent me, I’m afraid to use it. I tried for a while carrying around the contract in my shirt pocket but it weighed down my upper body so much that I developed scoliosis. After that, I dragged it in a red wagon behind me in case I needed to consult the fine print while purchasing a bagel. Eventually, I just gave up and decided to pay for everything with cash. That piece of plastic still in my wallet that I use when I want to get screwed? That’s a condom, not a credit card.

The other part of the contract is simple; if you repeatedly accept invitations, it’s only fair that you extend them as well. The options are endless….cook dinner in your home (for a crowd, or for a few), host your friends at a restaurant, have a picnic in the park. The important thing is that you… just do it (or is that Nike’s slogan?). In any case, more festivities, more fun, more family, more friends leads to more lasting connections. Cheers!
God doesn’t give rules and conditions just to see how close we can come to obeying them. Nor does He have a set of rules for one and a different rule for another. If all aboard that ship were to be spared they had to do what God demanded of them. In other words there is no such thing as half a Christian.
The Gospel Trail is harder to reach by public transit and resupply is more difficult because it avoids towns. However, it’s easier to cover by car than the Jesus Trail.
The next evening, Wallace set off to travel to the mysterious Mr Qualtrough's address by tram. However, when he arrived in Menlove Avenue, he found that although there was a Menlove Gardens North, South, and West, there was no East. While in the vicinity, Wallace spoke to several people, including local residents and a policeman. When speaking to the policeman, he checked the time with him: 7.45pm. Wallace remained in the area around 15-20 minutes longer, before boarding a tram towards home.

A loss of skeletal muscle mass that may accompany aging. Studies indicate that the loss of skeletal muscle for the average normally healthy person amounts to about 20% between about 30 and 70 years of age. The loss may accelerate as aging progresses. The muscle is replaced by fat, usually in a subtle way that is not noticed by the individual, as by padding areas of muscle loss with extra fat. Muscle-strengthening and muscle-building exercises can prevent or reverse much of this problem.

How about the general situation happening in our momentum transfer paradigm experiment first? So a moving cart hits a stationary cart. They stick together after the collision.

A month is a long time... the sum of 30 days lived to the fullest.
After a week of classes, I have a few observations about going to school here. Who knows if these will pan out for the rest of the semester, but here’s what I’ve noticed thus far. First, being on a semester system rather than a quarter system, everything seems to move more slowly. Back at UW, I would already be thinking about my first midterms. Here, with 15 weeks of class, things don’t seem as rushed. Second, perhaps the professors are accustomed to Moroccan students who know English as a third or even fourth language. I say this because the amount of reading assigned for class in general is less than I would get in my classes at UW. From talking to other Moroccan students, it takes them much longer to read the same section of a textbook, simply due to the fact that I am a native English speaker and they are not. Due to these two trends, I think I’m going to have more free time than I would back home. I’m excited because this should give me the chance to join some clubs (Guitar Club, DJ Club, Explorer’s Club, maybe even Extreme Sports Club) and also tryout for the basketball, tennis, and ping pong (awesome!) teams.

Gillian McMurry Frustrated. With my traditional painting, most of the time I have a picture in my head that I want to produce but it almost never turns out as I had hoped. I am highly critical of my work. My paintings are trying to be realistic but often verge on cute and contrived. With mixed media stuff it is a little different. If I make a mistake I can make it work for me. It is a slower and more relaxing experience. I don't think it really has a style though.
My first day at school. I sat in the front row with my back straight, knees together, eyes forward, hands behind my back. I can't remember much about my first teacher except he made us sit like those baby trees tied to a stick. So I thought about the summer days of jumping into the fish pond with Tyler and Po, catching dragon flies and stealing walnuts from the tree hanging over our yard. I listened to birds that chirped chirped outside calling me to go climbing in case another abandoned nest awaited me in the crisscrossing branches.

OMG, if you've ever wanted to make a scrapbook album fast and in minutes and have not used My Memories to do so you are really missing out. It took me all of 5 minutes to create this template page once I downloaded the program. I've tried other programs and could never really get them to work for me the way I wanted and am amazed at the ease and comfort of use along with the affordability of the program. You get a bunch of templates with the program and you can also incorporate your jpg and png backgrounds and elements from other sources to create your own pages instead of using the templates. I have so many pictures just sitting, waiting to be printed, and put in scrapbooks, most are from my digital camera so they are already loaded on my computer.

It was on clearance and I've heard good things about all their other merchandise, so maybe I just got a bad egg!
One of the main advantages that reexaminations provide is that invalidity contentions can be tried in a cheaper forum using a broader claim construction regime, and you have an opportunity to short-circuit the plaintiff's litigation by staying the litigation at the district court. However, trying to guess whether or not a stay will be granted can become a confusing matter.
Volunteering. This is a noble thing to do, but each time one does it, particularly when one is doing it in a place that makes money in some capacity, think twice. In some parts of Asia this is considered an absurd thing to do, and I have observed that with its increased popularity, the worse employment prospects have become. It had better be for a pilot project or for a limited period. In South Korea when I offered to do work for a reduced rate, people would scrunch their nose; I found out that this means “the product must not be very good.”

Here, out of a Jiffy bag sent on spec, is one of the best books I’ve read this year. I’m coming out and saying that at the top because I fear that otherwise, people might drift away from reading a long review of a book they don’t know by an author nobody’s heard of. I almost ignored it myself, this being one of those books that arrive unsolicited, few of which appeal and hardly any of which I finish. But something made me sample the preface, and once I did, I knew I was trapped until the end.

I am NO good at frying anything – I always seem to burn it or not turn it up high enough. But I was going to give it a try. I poured my oil in the pan and turned the burner on high, just like the instructions said. I waited for it to heat up and then dipped the first blossom in batter. I put it in the frying pan and within seconds it was already turning black. There was so much oil splattering everywhere that I knew this just wasn’t going to turn out well. I finished dipping the rest of the blossoms in the batter and put them in the oil. I managed to turn them all over without getting severely burnt and then took them out of the pan. Here is what they looked like:

Furthermore, women-owned businesses upped employment by 6.2 percent, while men-owned businesses reduced workers by 2 percent.

Trine 2 has more complex puzzles without giving you new abilities to solve them. Originally, Trine 1′s puzzles were mostly platforming focused. Many puzzles then involved crossing gaps, reaching high ledges or using objects as weights. There were large sections of Trine where you could quickly run through. Frozenbyte has created puzzles with more moving pieces requiring more thinking from the player. You will have to divert water, move portals or attach pipes to redirect wind and fire. Trine 2 is flexible enough to have multiple solutions to most puzzles. There are elegant solutions and there are messy solutions, very messy solutions.

The Moroccanoil® hair care line nourishes, protects and fortifies hair by utilizing fairtrade argan oil and cutting-edge technology. The scent, however, is a clever provocateur. The composition includes the familiar aroma associated with hand lotion (classic white floral aldehyde) and introduces a mashup of suntan lotion, white amber and milky musk. The combination is luxurious, sensual and addictive, evoking memories of warm sandy beaches and vibrant turquoise waters, (something not lost on anyone paying attention to the colors used in the packaging of Moroccanoil® products).

He emerges from back stage with his authorial persona intact, if somewhat shakily nervous (he takes a call on his mobile because it might be, he says, from a publisher, only to find that it's his mum). He has some photographs of himself that he's happy to sign "for a gold coin donation": although they all look the same, they have "different expressions". Eager for feedback, he offers paper and pencils so the audience can note down their responses. We are given to understand that, but for the blindness of the publishing industry, we would be confronting one of the stars of teen fiction.
Two sewing patterns.

Dutch Studio Roosegaarde and fashion designer Anouk Wipprecht have joined forces to create an absolutely stunning piece of lingerie.

I'm torn on this one. I had high hopes for it, I admit to liking erotica even though I don't read it very often. I'm torn because while the story was decent there just wasn't enough sex in it for me. haha! The sex that was in there was graphic but not as graphic as I would like. I can see why a lot of people are liking this one, and I did like it, it just wasn't really enough for me in terms of erotica. You can also tell that this was the first novel by the author, the writing wasn't as good as you would expect for a more established author.

For our celebration, we met up with the American Woman's Association (I joined after we arrived) for a Thanksgiving potluck. Several other American families from our condo headed over to a big park on the beach and celebrated Thanksgiving with us. We enjoyed a wonderful afternoon. We got to eat turkey and all of the fixing. The flavors were perfect. Pumpkin pie, pecan pie, and candied yams and stuffing. It was all there.

When we moved in in May we made that space home to the pet feeding station and the cat litter boxes. It was functional, but not attractive. Last week I was inspired to dress it up on the cheap. Since the updates are spread over three blog posts, I've attached one "after" photo that has numbers. Here are the explanations that coordinate with those numbers:

So when I start thinking about the home ed side of things, that is actually the easy bit. Or it would be if I had nothing else to do. One evening a week the boys have home ed fencing club, and middle child has cub scouts. This has to be juggled between work and courses. And then there is the kids' daytime activities - weekly fencing, monthly home ed group, monthly geography group, weekly/fortnightly Explorers Group for the younger ones. (We keep the activities to a tolerable level, but when you top up with play-dates and inpromptu meet-ups it all adds up.) And there's the time we spend on projects, research, library visits, outings, workshops.

Designer jeans that anyone could afford was a movement away from dresses and such for a number of years before sunglasses bid goodbye to their nearby stores asking for more recent designs, and there is truly something for everyone, in every occasion. While the calvin klein cosmetics company and more varied and diverse as time goes along, giving women the calvin klein advertisments it long enough for things to sizzle, no? For that, it has to be recognized worldwide, especially after the calvin klein oxidized of its products.

These poems of past link to each other nicely, each speaking forwards and backwards to each other, with hints of history brought from one to another: ‘Airstream Bubble Trailer’ speaks to ‘The Tao tells me to go on loving you’ (not as cloying as the title might suggest).

As it turns out, my mother has some ideas on why not. Specifically, she is worried that the cord is wrapped around the baby's neck, and the baby won't turn because of this. To be fair, both my maternal grandmother and my mother's oldest sister lost full-term babies to cord issues, so my mother is particularly sensitive to this issue. On the other hand, um, thanks, mom. I really needed one more thing to worry about. I pointed out to her that the baby has already been head down once before, so this is likely NOT the problem. But you know mothers. . .they get inside your head. Of course, this same mother of mine has also suggested that a vaginal delivery of a transverse baby sounds dangerous to her. . .after I explained that c-sections are the only option for transverse babies. Argh. I know she means to be helpful, but this particular string of emails wasn't very helpful.

I will NOT do to my kids what my mother did to me. I don't want to come off as some slave laborer but they will definitely have responsibilities and chores around the house. I grew up in a two story house where my mother didn't have to look at my room but once a week. And about once a month she would come clean it herself. I remember when one of the neighbors neices came from Scotland and in the cutest Scottish accent she said "You have the dirtiest room I have ever seen!" And she was probably right. I guess maybe that's where my comfort from "lived in" comes, but my kids will not be having the same situation put on them. PLUS how happy will my son's future wife be when she marries a man who knows how to clean up after himself? :) I can only hope right?

He’d hung around a bit more over the last couple of weeks, getting to know when they were indoors, working out when his best chance might be. He’d realised she was usually home on a Friday, staying inside where he couldn’t see her until around tea time, then she’d come out and cut the front grass. Must be her way of marking the beginning of the weekend, he’d thought, and if she’s doing the front grass, the chances are she’ll do the back as well. That turned out to be just what she did, the front, then the back, every Friday afternoon.
Within this parallel universe into which we have somehow tripped, love can be a form of hate, hate a kind of love, and in this respect, both, of course, are racism.

We have now settled back into city life in Inverness, we have a new house....... well it's not a new house in any sense of the word. It is my family home that my parents have owned for about 30 years. Mam felt the house was too big for her on her own now, and we needed to buy a house in this area so we bought it from her. It a wonderful old detched cottage and we are all chuffed to bits with it. I'll post some piccies of it as soon as I can.
So, all of a sudden, I’m having fun painting, and I wanted to share with you guys that you can do this, too, even if you don’t consider yourself an artist or painter. I’m not being modest; I’ve never taken a painting class in my life, and I know these aren’t exactly masterpieces. I’ve seen sites that charge quite a bit per letter (and rightfully so,) but this is something you can do yourself if you stick with a simple theme and basic shapes. So, if you have a kid in your life, or a new mommy friend, and would like to give them the gift of the kiddo’s name spelled out on the wall, try it! The supplies are relatively inexpensive, and you won’t use all of the paint you buy on one project, so you get more bang for your buck. If you aren’t up to spelling out a long name, go with initials, or just the first letter of their first name.

An organized group of Texans known as Ringers have rallied behind Jurkis in support of the paper protector’s abolition. The decades-old group opposes the disposable bacteria borders on the grounds that they fail to keep buttocks free of disease and rim streaks. Ringers can be spotted daily in downtown Dallas with a full-blown personal toilet seat either under their arm or slung across their back with a length of rope or chain. Ringer veteran, William Terdzik insists “You gotta carry your own seat. It’s the only way to protect yourself from all the skanky glutes parkin’ their funk everywhere they go. Until a proper seat cover is invented, you might as well be sharing your underwear with a thousand of your closest neighbors.” The concept has been a natural evolution since the early nineties when the movement’s earliest pioneers would line the toilet seats of Texaco gas stations with their flannel shirts to avert germs. Needless to say, the results weren’t always as hygienic as intended and led to a fair share of flushed plaid.
Any American movie from the 1940s is bound to have, at a minimum, complicated attitudes towards Asian characters. The Letter is striking, however, because while from one angle the Malayans fit neatly into the era's preconceptions, their point of view is present from the beginning, and it's shown in a way that undermines the racist notions held by the English characters. Take the "head boy" (as he's called) who runs to see who's shooting and speaks the first line of the movie, "That's Mr. Hammond!" The delivery of the actor, Tetsu Komai, is as close to a verbal accusation as the Malayan characters ever get. Leslie orders him to get the plantation workers out of the house, and he does so. She retreats to her bedroom, her quiet but agonized sobbing the first hint we get of her relationship with Hammond. Komai hears it too, as he picks up Leslie's lacework and looks at it for a moment, visibly shaken and also evidently deciding what to do. Komai is given, in a word, motivation, something other movies often presumed the "sinister Oriental" not to need.
Chicago is mostly flat, which helps, though like Amsterdam it has wind to contend with.
However, let’s assume that the diversion of the English to the south is successful. For Winter 01, Germany builds two fleets and an army in Munich. The new army is to protect the homeland while the fleets get into position for the coming assault on England. The North Sea is taken and London and Edinburgh become German by the end of 1903. Germany may also lay claim to Norway if Russia gets careless in the north. Control of this new region gives Germany a corner of the board and room for future expansion.

It has become increasingly popular to use a “carrot and a stick approach” for, in theory, benefits cost savings. The supposed goal is encouraging employees to become healthier by making benefits more expensive for those who are perceived as unhealthy, using measurements like Body Mass Index, cholesterol, and blood pressure. These programs charge more to people who don’t measure up, either by giving “discounts” to employees who are perceived as healthy (carrot), or penalizing those perceived as less healthy (stick).

At the end of the day, all this nonsense boils down to poor governance. In the U.S., they pay pension fund managers monkey salaries and that's why they get monkey results. Worse still, their fiduciaries take a cover-your-ass approach, relying entirely on their brainless pension consultants who've never invested a dime in alternatives, don't understand the risks and don't understand the strategies to gauge whether the fees are worth it. They also don't understand how to structure a portfolio of alternatives, how they fit in the overall portfolio and how they're highly correlated to traditional asset classes.

The tiny Brooklyn Heights shop Two for the Pot, on Clinton near Atlantic, is treasured by its devotees for its careful and unusual selection of teas, coffees, brewing equipment, English foodstuffs and whatever other odd items that happen to appeal to the independently minded owner. Those devotees are often frustrated, however, as the store is erratic in its hours of operation. Stumbling by the door when the owner is accepting customers can feel like hitting the jackpot. But, then, that's part of the charm of the place.

As I'm getting set to write my new book, I'm facing a lot of options--far too many. I had originally wanted to write an internal drama with four characters. We'd know in the beginning when each of those characters died, but we wouldn't know what the impact of those deaths would be. At the same time, so many people died in Cyberlama that I'm curious to try and write a book where nobody dies. I'm also playing with the idea of collage--taking real speech from real people or fusing headlines from news stories into my prose. And, as I've mentioned over the last few days, I'm experimenting with more flowery prose as well.

I'm frustrated right now b/c I see my friends blogs and they are fancy, and I just can't seem to get mine to do what I want it to. I didn't really want anyone to see it mid change so I didn't blog. But now I've given up. It's new but not all that exciting. Oh well.

Otherwise you won’t quite get a good feel for just how I ended up where I’m at today. I usually try to leave out the detailed stuff about sex, but… Sex plays heavily into my origin story.

I'm just back from the London Book Fair this evening. What an extraordinary presence from new digital companies in the Digital Zone. I think the most significant piece of data is still to come over the following weeks when LBF announce who was at the book fair. From my perceptive, this was a 'trade show' when many authors decided to attended, where once the idea of attendance by authors was accepted but considered 'awkward' unless there was an agreed 'meeting' arranged between agent and publisher. This year, many authors took it upon themselves to take the bull by the horns and tackle publishers. I haven't seen that happen before. To be fair to the trade publishers there, and to many of the people I talked to, this was one of the first times I've seen trade publishers openly recognize that they were sharing an exhibition with more than an industry perspective.

You’ll have to trust me on this one, but I go into this unsure of where I will end up. That probably means this series will ramble on for longer than it should, but it also means I’m pretty excited about doing it. If I end up affirming the traditional view of Christ’s birth, that’s great. If I end up rejecting it, that’s fine, too. I simply haven’t given the subject a lot of thought, except to note some of the points I’ve made above, and that means you and I will be exploring this together. I hope you’ll feel free to contribute your own thoughts, comments, even research, as a conversation is much more interesting than a monologue.

At Signora S.’s the food was natural, alive, and varied. Aldous and I praised it and were told that the order and combination of the courses had been made according to the famous Dr. Bircher-Benner of a nearby clinic in Zurich. From recipes for food, we went on to speak of my “Recipes for Living and Loving.” I had been very active in psychotherapy that year and had almost finished my book. Aldous spoke about the origin of the word ”recipes”— it is the imperative of the Latin word recipere, to receive— and told our hosts how my recipes had succeeded with some people for whom the orthodox methods had failed. Krishnamurti asked a few questions and listened intently. We spoke about vitamins and imagination, solitary confinement, LSD, alcoholism, and the congress on extrasensory perception that Aldous had recently attended in the South of France.

I didn't have a very productive sewing night, but I did accomplish a little. Most of my evening was spent cutting out the rest of the background pieces for my Swoon quilt. Sadly, I realized when I was cutting out the last squares that I was cutting them out wrong!

I spent the rest of the evening sewing black sashing onto my butterfly quilt.

Not long ago, in the bright light of a half moon, I went up on to the Downs to visit the Uffington White Horse. This was an activity I discovered a few years ago, in winter – and believe me, visiting the Horse on a frosty winter night under a full moon is magic enough to make the back of your neck prickle.
One thing we noted during our stay in Ireland was how laid back everyone was. It was refreshing to note that no one was interested in getting us out of a restaurant or pub so that they could turn the table over. Throughout our journey we were never rushed and allowed to sit and enjoy our dinner at each establishment and were never rushed out the door. It was refreshing when you consider the United States where everything is about getting people in and out of a restaurant with no consideration of the flow of the meal.
This weekend, I'll write again, having rediscovered the simple pleasure of writing a letter.
Nevertheless, everyone is fairly sure the DA has done this ‘excellent', ‘progressive', unbiased, objective journalist a gross disservice. So gross, in fact, the evidence is of little interest. On what basis do they arrive at that opinion? Here's a radical question: Should Anna Majavu apologise to the DA? I guess we will never know. No one wants to know the answer to that question.
That was the norm. Sometimes, however, he'd dump us and go off to town too, and mum didn't really ever come as there was always friction, going right back to the days when she wasn't considered good enough for my father because a) she was a Catholic; and b) she'd been engaged before.

She then told me she’d listed her boat on Ebay, which was a strange place to advertise an expensive boat. She went on to say once they sold theirs, if mine was still available they’d consider it. At this point her story had changed entirely, initially her husband had told me and I’d made a very clear point to ask whether they’d have to have their boat sold first before buying mine, and had been given a resounding No!

My dream this morning was downright simple. In my sleep, my dream has the weirdest transitions with places and characters, and my first setting was a mall. I was with two of my college friends, when another two people we knew appeared shortly. Their appearance oddly annoyed me, and two of my friends noticed it, so we decided to buy snacks. Do you know that weirdness during your dream that this place is quite similar to the ones in real life, but somehow, there are distorted parts you would never imagine, and it has a creepy and outlandish feeling? After buying snacks we headed to the mall exit. The sky was dark, there were leafless trees in the aisle and the breeze had a bizarre coldness, like that of a corpse. This is where it all started to transform, from a simple one, to a grotesque dream I never thought would happen to me. I could barely remember the exact scene, but the two of my friends were two meters ahead of me, then I was trying to shot something in the brick walls. All I remembered was my friends were trying to scare me out so they teased me and spotted a horrifically captured image with my shot. And they were laughing with the formed image of a weird grinning face along the walls, I sighed in relief because it wasn’t that scary, when suddenly, an image of a grim reaper with his renowned scythe flashed for a second in my eyes and the scene transition splattered in red.

Playing as 5 characters instead of 1…actually isn’t as confusing as it would seem. The critters scurry along with one another…so when one moves, they all move. Another thing I like about the gameplay is that you don’t have to move your character(s) to an exact spot. For the most part, they all stay in a little huddle in one spot, and you click on various aspects of the environment to manipulate your surroundings into getting what you want/need (whether it’s an item to trade, a key, or a lost critter you’re helping to find). At times, certain scenarios allow you to click any of the 5 creatures to attempt to complete a task, with only 1 being actually able to do it successfully. It’s a process of trial and error… or logic if you want to call it that, but sometimes the critter that solves it, does so by a completely random, non sensical body movement… so logic isn’t always the case.

I woke up early this morning with the intention to write, and read the above passage as I was waiting for my computer to warm up. It seemed apt. I’ve been contemplating what to write today, the latest anniversary in a year of sad anniversaries. Inspired by the Zinsser’s wise words, I’m just going to let it flow.
I made a pledge to myself this weekend: I am going to take better care of myself. The last month has been a whirlwind of taking care of everyone but me, and the migraines every day last week were the proof in the pudding. While I love doing things for others, it shouldn’t come at such a heavy load on me, my mind, and my body.

Another great example of favorable revisionist history that men have down, is the sports stories from high school. These shining moments, where they scored the game-winning point in double-overtime, playing through two sprained ankles. Some men will actually have footage to back it up, and be prepared to watch it more than once, slowed down, then paused. Even when you watch the tape, you’ll see he scored that point on the free throw line, and not the three point line, while being double-teamed. It was still the winning point though!

Property management companies have two primary goals in mind: Reduce operating costs for ownership and increase the value of the asset. As a result, many companies focus on spending less by putting jobs up for bid to lower the costs for labor and materials, changing maintenance programs to reduce labor costs and removing energy expenses where they see overuse.
Quinn has a very high opinion of Mitchell, calling her “beyond reproach.” But in a 2007 appearance on The O’Reilly Factor, Mitchell told O’Reilly that there wasn’t a bias at any of the major broadcast networks and that she didn’t think Chris Matthews was a “liberal thinker.”

Velcros are really not well suited for overnight. They don’t secure well, coming loose and pulling uncomfortably. Like wire brush can get a bit entangled.
First off, I sure hope my post is not mistaken as an invitation to join the crowd of people who are living “double” lives. The invitation intended is “take a look inside, find the things that need to be changed, and work on changing them.” “Sin” cannot be overcome without the recognition of its existence, as Jesus proved. Christians have it relatively easy; they can call upon an almighty God for help and know immediately that they are forgiven. Non-believers don’t have this luxury but a determined soul possesses a certain amount of might because that same almighty God creates the soul.

Marching in one of the two inner columns was potentially more hazardous than one of the two outer columns. If a soldier in one of the inner columns dropped, he frequently tripped up three or four soldiers following him. The members of Xu Guan’s battalion were so deadened by their seemingly unending march that their reaction times had tripled or quadrupled. Usually, soldiers in the outer columns fell to the side when they dropped, causing far fewer soldiers to trip over their bodies.
The processes of concentration, foreign ownership and land degradation came to be a central concern of supranational bodies and NGOs that warn, like the United Nations Organizations for Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), of the “negative effects of these phenomena on food security, agricultural employment and the development of family farming.”

Thanks for your kind thoughts and comments. I don't usually carry around so much melancholy. At least, today is happy and peaceful. I don't feel the weight of the world on me (thanks Mark for that description) now. Strange how all that responsibility and worry makes an appearance at times. Lack of sleep, too much analysis, projecting outcomes, self-pity--these are my pitfalls.

That this made him a typical Fascist rather than an atypical one can be seen if we add in the British example. Most people have probably forgotten that prewar Britain had a large Fascist movement too -- under Sir Oswald Mosley. And Sir Oswald initially used to EXPEL from the British Union of Fascists anybody who made antisemitic utterances! When his meetings came under constant attack from Jewish Leftists, however, he had something of a rethink.
Then there is another kind of mall. Perhaps it is just as bustling as it used to be, back when it supported three separate record shops (one of which was actually–swear–cool) and an honest-to-god Tiny Comic Book Store. Not too big–just one long oval with Macy’s on one end and Sear’s on the other. A solidly striving, middle-class mall in America. Now, yes, there always was a bit of a crime problem, but you get a lot of shoplifters at any mall and quite frankly, the whole situation was needlessly exacerbated by the Police Chief getting himself run over while in pursuit three times. Twice, maybe. Three times, you start looking at the common denominator.

“I’ve watched him make decisions that would make another man or woman’s hair curl,” Biden told the crowd of 150 inside the Italian Community Center in Milwaukee, according to a pool reporter on scene. “I think I can say … no president, and I would argue in the 20th century and including now the 21st century, has had as many serious problems which are cases of first-instance laid on his table,” Biden said. “Franklin Roosevelt faced more dire consequences, but in a bizarre way it was more straightforward.” Ah Yes, Obama has faced such harrowing decisions, all of which include spending our money like it grows on trees.

These days—if you will permit me to pretend to give weight to the mass delusion that is the historical present—the dark mountain is exploded and transposed onto the cosmic abyss, a putatively post-hierarchical domain whose hyper-alpine dimensions remain fundamentally obscure. It is no longer the image of a dark mountain that haunts the thought-horizon of Reality, but an omnipresent dimensional blackness that is at the same time a sheer impenetrable blankness, the vision of something whose presence is nothing other than the form of its own non-visibility. All around us the general darkness of the observable universe understood via Olbers’s paradox coincides weirdly with the singular negative mirage of the black hole. Here the world’s summit, the untouchable touchpoint or threshold between the lived ephemeral present and the ultimate Reality that lies beyond, appears everywhere and nowhere, beckoning lightlessly in a space whose negative, astrophobic affect renders absolute enclosure and infinite exposure indistinguishable. Correlatively, human consciousness is now strangely dis-directed, incessantly following its own most wayward and worried advice: be someone, be yourself! Indeed, the whole visible material realm is itself currently installed as the very summit of being, a bright (yet actually how dim) peak (less than 1% of the measurable universe) positioned atop a mountainous cosmic mass of dark energy and matter—the backdrop of interminable collective fantasies, both humanist and nihilist, daydreams of a geocentric non-entity: the human and/or post-human we. Now I am confronted with black as a necessary object of contemplation, an inarguable index of Reality. The horizon of the universe is black—black is the horizon of the universe. The necessity of black as present term of mystic thought is composed of its substantial negativity and imperceptible positivity, according to which, in a purely non-arbitrary way, it is no less ‘out there’ than ‘in here’, equally internal and external to consciousness. Black is its own image and thus fulfills the
I wore a navy blue dress for my son's wedding, so I thought a dress in a shade of pink would nice for my daughter's wedding. I liked the scarlet pink color of the dress on the left in the photo collage above, but I didn't care for the fact it was sleeveless, with a bolero style jacket. I liked the middle dress color quite a bit, and at first glance I thought it had three quarter length sleeves, which was what I wanted. Then I remembered that the bridesmaids would be wearing purple, and this color was too close a match. Plus, on closer examination it didn't have sleeves, but another bolero jacket look. Perhaps a similar, but slightly darker shade of raspberry pink would be nice, like the dress on the right? I wasn't so sure such a form fitting dress would look attractive on my plus size figure.

The mechanisms that link the onset of diabetes with subsequent development of cardiovascular disease include above-average lipid levels (lipid levels can easily be reduced through proper diet in most cases), inflammation of vascular walls (pH control and proper diet can reduce inflammation in most cases), high blood pressure (proper diet and exercise can lower blood pressure in most cases), and an excess of ‘bad’ cholesterol produced by the liver (probably helped along by a bad diet).

In the and, wich card should we choose? Naturally is related ti various factors.

Of course, it is TRUE. Any sin, small or large, brings us condemnation. An offense against and Eternal God is itself of Eternal Magnitude. And only and Eternal Sacrifice could suffice to make reparation for our sin both mortal and venial. However, as you so aptly pointed out some sin is an abomination in the eyes of God just like they are in the eyes of men. Even before I became Catholic I thought it was crazy to think that God saw all sin EQUALLY especially when so many verses refuted this sophistry.

Once the Hoxie wagon company began their westward trek, everything seemed to be faring well. The weather seemed beautiful. Everyone seemed to be in good spirits – including the black family from Illinois named Jones that managed to join the wagon train without any opposition. Both Naomi and Rachel attracted the romantic attention of the train’s two scouts – ‘Skate’ Guthrie and James ‘Jim’ Ebbets (Ryan Robbins and Christopher Heyerdahl). This contentment finally ended when Thunder Heart Woman spotted wolves feeding off the corpse of a buffalo and when the train later crossed what I believe was the Big Blue River. The incident proved to be the first of two disagreements between the couple. Thunder Heart Woman viewed the wolves as a sign that the wagon train would come to a bad end. She insisted that the Wheeler family return to Missouri. Jacob dismissed her worries as superstition on her part. But the expression on his face clearly indicated his doubts on the wisdom of the trip.

The Berne Convention provides a set of basic rules aimed at ensuring a uniform protection of the rights of authors in their literary and artistic works.

At around 5 p.m. on Saturday, I was sitting on a bench across from Lincoln Center, waiting around for a 6:15 p.m. screening of Robert Altman's California Split, a film I had never seen before. Suddenly, I received a text message from a friend of mine who had recently passed the New York bar exam and had planned on celebrating that evening; she informed me in her text that she and her friends had decided, as part of the celebration, to skate at the ice rink in Bryant Park. After maybe a minute of deliberation, I decided to do something I rarely do when it comes to films: I decided to forgo the movie and go join them. (Sorry, Bob.) My decision was influenced in part by the fact that one of my roommates has a copy of the out-of-print DVD of the film—albeit a DVD that is apparently missing about three minutes of footage that had to be cut as a result of music-rights issues. Apparently, the possibility of seeing a print of the film that would be considerably closer than its home-video counterpart to Altman's original vision wasn't quite enough to stave off the lure of socializing.

Many of you have complained about the web-slinger equiping new gear from S.H.I.E.L.D., this was obviously dropped in the show for a reason….ENTERTAINMENT! Now let’s be honest, I’m pretty sure that throughout the series, you guys would probably get annoyed of all the web slinging sound and probably bored of the same moves. People mostly want to see something different that attracts you to watch what happens next. Sometimes the tech interacts with plot of the episodes. For Example, when Spidey had the new Iron Spider suit, it gave him a problem on how to control it and how to fight it when the Living Laser took over it. It gives the character risks and advantages that will make you want to keep watching. The Spidey Motorcycle was cool…..

If you opt for banjos, you can still catch Della Mae next Tuesday (May 18th) at the great Cantab Lounge in Cambridge, taking in the weekly jam there while you’re at it, or you can listen to them as you cruise Boston Harbor on the “Bluegrass Cruise” (May 15th— click here for a flyer with details).

W is considering enrolling in this accelerated secondary school which goes from 7th-12th grades. I'm not very keen on middle school at all, but it's his choice, and it's one of the very few schools I actually approve of. They give an admissions test next year and W will be taking it. He may not want to actually go when the time comes, but at least he'll have taken the necessary steps to have that option right up to the last minute. It's my job to make sure all doors are open for him if he does choose to go there. He also will be taking the California Achievement Test (CAT-E) in a couple of months.

Since there is no story to talk about, and no acting to critique, all I have to go on is the editing choices of director Hal Ashby. Ashby decided to make this movie experience as close to “being there” as possible. The problem with this is that unless the viewer is sitting with thousands of other screaming Stones fans, drinking out of those cheap red cups, and getting bumped from all directions by obnoxious audience members, the “being there” experience is lacking, and the end result is that Let’s Spend the Night Together becomes monotonous, leaving the viewer wondering why they didn’t just pop the live CD in their player instead.
