Well, everyone knew that, right? Yes, the drone program was indeed very well known -- perhaps the world's worst-kept secret. But until Brennan's speech Monday, it was not officially acknowledged. He was, in effect, outing what had been a "covert action" program conducted by the CIA.

A. Oleander caterpillars are kind of cute but also heavy feeders. They are the immature stages of the polka dot moth that is also quite colorful. Some gardeners tolerate the caterpillars that can reduce the oleander foliage to shreds. Others handpick them from the plants when noted or apply a natural control of Thuricide or a spinosad containing insecticide. The later product is usually only available at independent garden centers. Both need a day or two to be effective and control the caterpillars.

Compared to bottles, frankly, there is no comparison. Canning technology has improved to the point that a beer's taste isn't compromised by the metal.

When introducing your puppy to a dog park--or any pack of dogs for that matter--keep in mind that some play activities may be way over your pup's head for his stage of development. Puppies are resilient and often seem to enjoy rough games of chase or tumble.

Planting pointers: Under 8 inches tall at maturity, pansies grow very slowly from seed; for quicker color, use transplants in late fall. To encourage the fine, fibrous roots to grow out, make shallow cuts to the root ball before planting. Plant at the same depth as in the pot; too deep and they'll rot. They prefer rich, well-drained soil in a sunny spot with afternoon shade. Or plant them under a deciduous tree; they'll enjoy shade as the weather warms. Great in containers or planted over bulbs.

My wife told me recently that she has lost feelings for me, and that it has been for several years. We rarely have sex (twice in the last year).

We're not really caring about personal stats, but we're caring about what the team success is. And we got the job done in the first round without a ton of offensive contribution from our line. That being said, we're going to need to step up and help the team in both defensive and offensive ways here in the second round."

Age shouldn't be the only measure of this movie's appeal. "Away From Her" is leavened by plenty of humor, and set in a slightly surreal landscape where the damnedest things take place. (Keep an eye out for an Alzheimer's patient who used to be a play-by-play announcer.) As is often the case with short stories expanded to feature-film length, Ms. Polley's adaptation is most successful when it stays close to its source material. The tone changes, and the style broadens, in scenes that extend Grant's encounters with a woman, Marian (Olympia Dukakis), whose husband has been a patient in Fiona's care facility. But that's a minor matter in a powerful drama. And, far from being a solo turn by Julie Christie, Sarah Polley's film is a duet that includes -- indeed, depends equally on -- Gordon Pinsent's superb performance as a loving, grieving husband who gives new meaning to the notion of letting go.

In addition to the city-run Little Hollywood program, there is privately run low-income housing throughout the city of 35,000 residents.

Although carménère produces dark red wines, this rosé was pale pink. It is a fresh, soft, smooth and delicate wine that has subtle strawberry and raspberry flavors and a refreshing citrusy finish. It's dry but not bone dry. In fact, this wine is so well-balanced and easy to drink that I had to remind myself that it does have a 13.5 percent alcohol level. This is a great summer wine to be served chilled on the patio or near the pool. It makes a fine aperitif or a pair with light entrees.

Finally, the O'Malley administration's insistence that Constellation and Exelon commit to producing 10 times more renewable energy in Maryland than they had initially proposed may sound like an effort to burnish the governor's environmental credentials should he seek some higher office, but it would also have some benefits for the sufficiency and reliability of the state's power supply.
"People begin dropping rabbits off at shelters a couple of weeks after Easter and continue through mid-late summer," said Adam Goldfarb, director of the Pets at Risk Program for The Humane Society of the United States. "The novelty wears off for the kids, the rabbit gets relegated to the basement or garage. When the parents get tired of taking care of the rabbit, they either surrender the rabbit to a shelter or rescue group or 'set it free' in a park," where most are picked off by predators or die of exposure.

Apparently someone Easter unabashedly would like to have a relationship with is Hollywood actress Lisa Bonet. We know this because he used her name as a song title. In fact, he even e-mailed this love-letter track to her. According to Easter, "She commented, 'That made my year. OMG, I love this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful song. Are you on a record label?

Let the White House delude its Democratic base with the promise that the Buffett Rule is only the leading edge of comprehensive tax reform; the top of the 99 understand that, in the context of a divided Congress, it's more likely to be a fire wall -- the crumb congressional Republicans throw their Democratic counterparts in return for preservation of the Bush tax cuts and preferential tax rates for investment income.

The where (and the what): Madeira is a Portuguese archipelago located about 400 miles off the coast of north Africa. It consists of the island of Porto Santo, the Ilhas Desertas (deserted islands) and the island of Madeira, where the capital of Funchal is located (even though it's part of Portugal, the archipelago is an autonomous region). Our destination was Funchal, which from all depictions seemed tropical and remote enough to forget the daily distractions that we so badly wanted to abandon in exchange for some true relaxation.
Carbon monoxide detectors are widely available. The Environmental Protection Agency suggests that consumers keep back-up (not replacement) detectors. There are several types of carbon monoxide detectors on the market. Some but not all have been laboratory tested. When shopping, select a carbon monoxide detector for its features, not its price. Then, carefully follow installation instructions. Unlike a smoke detector, where you can easily confirm the cause of the alarm, carbon monoxide is invisible and odorless. Here's what to do if a carbon monoxide alarms goes off in your home:
My mother not only spoke about the sewer workers; she maintained contact with the Socha and Wroblewski families, and would have done the same with Kowalow had he not disappeared after the war. As a boy I watched her meticulously prepare parcels of clothing for the two families living in Soviet-occupied Poland. Her boundless gratitude impelled her to travel to Jerusalem in 1977 to provide the sole testimony that led to Socha and Wroblewski and their wives being named "Righteous Among the Nations," enabling their families to receive monthly stipends. And in 1981, a year before her death, my mother dedicated a Garden of the Righteous Gentiles in Wilmington, with two of its trees planted in memory of Socha and Wroblewski, the first memorial in the United States to Christians who saved Jews.

First, the government was never involved in the manufacture of automobiles. And second, the bailout, by most accounts, has been successful, with Chrysler having just repaid $7.5 billion in bailout loans. This suggests a certain selectivity of details, a tailoring of facts to fit the argument. At times, it also leads to unintended ironies, as when Mamet cites the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (which he calls the Consumer Safety Board) and the Department of Homeland Security as evidence of top-down liberal bureaucracy, when, in fact, all of them were created under Republican presidents.

I celebrate Dr. Anderson's "one-hour" rule and believe many vets can benefit by spending a bit of time greeting their animal patients and making their acquaintance before performing exams. Thank goodness my own personal physician says hello, asks me how the family is, how things are going and other chit chat before exams. If he just said hello and began examining me I'd be horrified. Yet, I would imagine millions of animals are handled just this way every day in veterinary offices.

More kids -- 92 -- had been allowed to finger-feed themselves and 63 babies had been spoon-fed with pureed foods during the weaning stage. Differences showed up between the two groups. The babies who ate finger foods liked carbohydrates more; the spoon-fed babies liked sweets more. More of the spoon-fed kids were obese or overweight.

In "Stooges," they have embraced the comic absurdity of the classic trio so wholeheartedly that it's almost impossible not to be won over by the eye-poking, head-slapping, nose-twisting shenanigans that pepper nearly every scene.

But there's another good reason to reduce the size of the House, one suggested by the chairman of the Missouri Democratic Party.
In situations like these, certain patterns often emerge. The unemployed partner begins to feel discouraged and withdraws, no longer sharing what he or she is doing to find work. And, eventually, that makes the working partner feel as if the spouse isn't doing enough. Communication breaks down, and resentments build -- at the very moment they need to hold each other up.

Abe takes his Genesis seriously. Just how seriously, Linda learns in short order. After Abe has a stroke, she discovers that her husband has been busy spilling his seed at a fertility clinic (helped along by cheap porn).

A: Certainly the economy is a big piece of the puzzle (with) changing reimbursement. With health-care reform on the horizon and different incentives that are being put forward, we have to really respond to those changes and run the most efficient operation we can.

So our quality outcomes and clinical excellence is a very important piece.

I just wish the beginning of the race could have been a nice single-file line like when I got back out there. Maybe that's my lesson to learn there."
Destruction: By no means the worst earthquake to hit Italy in modern times, nor the most severe quake of the year (in which thousands died in northern Iran) this two-pronged seismic strike nevertheless resonated worldwide. That's because of the havoc it wreaked at the Basilica of St. Francis, one of the most beloved saints in the Catholic Church and the namesake of San Francisco. The first quake was followed by an even stronger shock that destroyed exquisite ceiling and wall frescoes in the basilica's upper church, killing those who were inspecting damage from the earlier event.

Hey, George: Duncan has done a nice job in a tough spot for the Indians this year. He's tough, smart and has fit in well coming off the bench as DH, first baseman, outfielder and pinch-hitter. I just don't know if he can be that productive playing every day.
On the second question, Mr. Schurick's attorney, Dwight Pettit, has sought to persuade the jury that the intent was not to keep voters home but to act as a counter-intuitive spur for potential Ehrlich voters to head to the polls. Circuit Judge Lawrence P. Fletcher-Hill has made his opinion clear: "The message, in the court's judgment, is plainly fraudulent," he said, adding that it was "an attempt to try to get people to stay home." What the jury will conclude remains to be seen.
"The Shabaab network inside the United States is tailor-made for what al-Qaida wants to accomplish in this country," Sanderson said. "They have ties to al-Qaida, they have the rhetoric. It's not a very big stretch to turn that into attacks in the United States."

Boccieri's ads don't mention his health care vote; none of the 219 House Democrats who support the legislation are talking about it in campaign ads.

"Our hope is that institutions will see the wisdom and benefit of moving towards a common form," Hamilton says.
House of Chicken is a tiny, almost invisible place — yet another kebab joint in the corner of a Hawthorne strip mall adrift in the Los Angeles sprawl.

A pollution control facility designation means significantly smaller assessment increases, which mean that school districts and other taxing bodies get smaller increases in revenue.
Clippers-Memphis: Sorry to predict that Chris Paul and Blake Griffin are going down. The deep, talented Grizzlies have Zach Randolph back in the starting lineup, adding a low-post option to the team's deadly perimeter attack. Rudy Gay, injured during last year's playoffs, is back with a vengeance, and Tony Allen, the league's best backcourt defender, will be swarming all over Paul, who may be limited by a groin injury. This would be a different story if Griffin were more advanced in his low-post moves and defense, but he's not there yet. Memphis (with the home-court advantage) in seven.
Upward mobility also has been cited as a reason that children from low-income families become healthy adults, the study pointed out. Yet the researchers found that income in adulthood didn't offset childhood poverty.

These days, it's just good to have a job. But remaining gainfully employed can take a toll on health, especially if your work has you up at odd hours and sleeping irregularly.

I "escaped" from the psych ward at Herrick Hospital in Berkeley, where I had been for a couple of weeks for depression. With money I had stashed, I got on a bus to San Francisco, got out at the Transbay Terminal and hailed a cab to the Golden Gate Bridge. I was 33. I scribbled a note of apology to my son, who was then 7. I had been suffering from severe, immobilizing, torturous depression for several months, and was simply obsessed with killing myself to end the agony that no medication seemed to touch.

The transfer, reportedly the first on a large scale since the wrenching 1947 partition that created Pakistan out of the collapsing British rule in India, spotlights a community caught in the middle of a political and religious divide in troubled Pakistan. Hindus increasingly have been targeted by mobs, kidnappers and extortionists as Islamic fundamentalism and lawlessness have spread.
No matter what happens, the campaign is expected to slog on. A win by Romney wont erase how close he came to losing his birth state. A win by Santorum wont erase Romneys edge in money, organization, endorsements and perceived electability.
Hey, Eliot: You're forgetting the two sixth-round draft picks the Browns received in the trade, too. It's possible they could receive a compensatory draft pick if Hillis leaves in free agency. That wouldn't be until 2013, however. Last year's ground-and-pound evaporated in the last month of the season. The offense needed a complete overhaul. Unfortunately, the changes haven't been effective. The Browns know they have take offense in the upcoming draft.

The lavash shawarma wrap ($9.99) was tasty but not a standout. Grilled chicken breast, along with garlic sauce and grilled tomatoes and onions, were wrapped in thin lavash bread. Pockets of wood-fired crispness insulated the bread from any sogginess. The chicken was well-seasoned but slightly dry. The wrap came with a Greek salad dressed with a mild lemon vinaigrette.

Contests like that are the traditional, old-school adventure races, according to Bettendorf Fire Chief Gerry Voelliger, who has operated his own Thunder Rolls adventure camp for the last six years based on knowledge gleaned in part from his 2006 completion of the 500-mile, 10-day lesson-in-insanity known as Primal Quest. Think July in the Utah desert. Voelliger said the air bladders in fellow competitors running shoes were exploding from the heat; penalties were incurred by those teams of four that had any member require the services of an IV bag to keep moving. Voelliger estimates he got a total of about 20 hours of sleep throughout the 10 days of fun/torture.

The rest of "MDNA" is dark, but not that dark. In "Love Spent," she calls out a former lover as a pure gold digger with some cutting lines: "I guess if I was your treasury / you'd have found the time to treasure me." But in no time, Madonna loses herself in her own chemically induced euphoria, which she sings "feels like a drug and I can't get enough" ("I'm Addicted," a whirling synth gem that should have been a single). Ever the tortured Catholic, she prays for guidance ("hail Mary, full of grace," in "I'm a Sinner"), and eventually concludes, over a hard, comforting dance beat and in a sing-speak voice perilously close to actual rapping, "I'm gonna be OK / I don't care what the people say" ("I Don't Give A").

But reversing the new law's payment changes from one day to the next would be a huge legal and logistical challenge, raising many questions.

Another blow came earlier this year when Boeing announced it was closing its defense plant in Wichita.

Danbury, Conn.: To Voicer John McCarthy: Nobody said Barack Obama's mother or Bill Richardson's mother didn't pass down her heritage to her son. If Obama classifies himself as a black man and Richardson classifies himself as Hispanic, who are you to judge? During segregation, no white people even wanted to identify black members of their family. Now, everybody wants to point out that Obama is half white. Would anyone have brought that up 30 years ago? His being biracial is besides the point. He was the most qualified candidate to win, and not because he is black or white.

Reuben learns how the transforming serum in a werewolf's bite, which Rice calls Chrism, often fails to turn people into werewolves — and the same is true of "The Wolf Gift," which delivers a far less potent bite than one expects. Rice does finally hit her unique, imaginative stride very late, but it will be a long wait for readers. For some, in fact, it will be much too long to wait.

Its first verse goes: Don't go to any trouble / You know I won't be here long. Other lyrics were just as sobering: Some days I'm so confused, Lord / My past gets in my way and I am so afraid of dying.

There's just one bathroom left on my list. It's a small group latrine in the Baths of the Philosopher, where fragments of a stone seat perch above a deep channel.

I've been trying to find the answers to my questions. I keep watching the news and nobody seems to bring it up. On this 999 thing, I don't quite understand it. They say you will pay 9 percent on everything. Food is getting horrendously expensive these days. Are we going to have to pay 9 percent tax on our food bill in addition to the St. Louis County tax and the Missouri state tax? Won't that be a lot of tax to make the food cost much more than it is now? How about if you buy a car or if you buy a house? Will you have to pay 9 percent tax in addition to the county tax and the state tax? Won't that make everything beyond the ability of a person to pay even if you are working? And I can't seem to find an answer to that in all the discussions. And I was getting a little nervous. So I wish somebody would publish an answer to that.

It was not just a breakthrough game for SLU, it was a record-setting one. SLU held SIUC to 18.2 percent shooting in the first half, 23.5 percent in the second half, and the Salukis' 20.5 percent shooting for the game was the worst in SIUC history. The Salukis (0-2) made just eight field goals total, as SLU tied its school record for fewest field goals allowed in the shot-clock era, matching the eight Oklahoma A&M had on Jan. 10, 1947. A contributing factor was that in the second half, SLU sent SIUC to the line 28 times, denying them a lot of chances to take field goals. Still, SLU held the Salukis to just four field goals in each half, and the first half defense was dominating.

But that's led to a patchwork of exceptions and conflicting rulings -- a mess worsened by the fact that the federal executive branch (mainly the State Department) fiercely resists such efforts to seek justice, as of course do the accused states.

Hey, Tony: Why didn't the Browns look at Marty Schottenheimer as a potential head coach -- before hiring Shurmur? Apparently, Marty might get back in at Tampa Bay. In my view, it must have been Mike Holmgren's huge ego that didn't allow him to at least interview Marty for the Browns job last year. Granted he's never led a team to the Super Bowl (to date), but I'd take Marty's skills over Shurmur's any day. -- Terry Holzemer, Palo Alto, Calif.

His descendants (Pfeiffer, Jonny Lee Miller, Chloe Grace Moretz, Gulliver McGrath) are living in the cluttered ruins of Collinwood, their vast mansion.

I'm certain my kids will one day see that we made the right choice. It will mean they won't feel torn -- or guilty -- choosing between their own family's financial needs and Mom and Dad's utility bill.

Cheerleading, it's called. For those with short memories, the practice was at the heart of a major Wall Street investigation following the collapse of dot-com stocks more than a decade ago.

Attempts to theologize the events of that day have always fallen flat for me. I do not think God abandoned us, nor do I think we were being punished. I do not blame Islam for the terrorists' actions, and I am aggrieved by the way some people in our country have used those actions to demonize all Muslims. But short of what I believe to be not true about that day, I find myself at a loss for words. I once held out a hope that the tragedy of September 11 could become something that would draw our global community closer together, rather than driving us apart, but that hope is now tenuous at best.
