Dear Brene: I agree that you owe your date authenticity about your feelings and the bulk of your attention. You also owe him a genuine thank you at the end of the night. Goodnight kisses or other favors are NEVER required (and we learned from our column of July 13, 2011, that many girls do not kiss on a first date). Your date may offer you alcohol or drugs. Don't accept. If you feel you owe him more than what is stated here — or you are stringing him along, please seek healing for low self-esteem or a “poverty” mentality that says you don’t deserve to be treated well or that you need to manipulate men to get what you want.

I think the way you approach her is as a little fat woman who was the cook and who happened to be in the guise of a teapot for the purposes of an animated movie by the Disney Studios. Consequently you attack it purely as a whole person, not that she's made of china or that she's breakable but that she's a little busy, fat, overweight lady who's a bit of a charmer, who cares very much about her little boy and is a strong member of the workforce at the castle. You play a whole person.

Hospitality takes practice, and it has consequences. In my own tradition, the Eucharist is a place where we both learn and practice hospitality. God welcomes us to a feast that he provides with his own flesh and blood, and through it He offers us an ongoing opportunity to be wholly transformed. When Eucharistic hospitality becomes a habit, we start asking questions of ourselves and of the world in which we live. We remember that the church is not ours, but God's, and act accordingly. We begin to ask if our public policies, both foreign and domestic, reflect our value of hospitality. We seek active ways to make our hearts and homes places of gracious welcome, even at the risk of being made uncomfortable, or being asked to change.

If you have already put some in the ground and frost is in the forecast, be sure to carefully cover them with sheets, blankets or newspaper and remove the following morning after the frost has burned off.

What the voter ID requirements represent, pure and simple, is an undemocratic attempt to disenfranchise legitimate poor and minority voters, many of whom simply are not registered to drive or have difficulty getting to a government office to obtain necessary papers.

(On how imperative it is to push for McCoy to be the man as opposed to starting over)- "Until you find the man that you think can be the man, you might make changes every year. I'm not opposed to that. You have to find that person, you have to find that person. These artificial constraints, 'Well it's not healthy to change quarterbacks.' I know it's not healthy.

The last of those passed the House, too, but the other three are awaiting action. Of those, the failure to pass a long-term highway bill is particularly glaring. House Speaker John Boehner announced in November that he was proceeding with the bill, but so far he has been able to pass only a short-term extension. The House also has yet to act on the China currency bill the Senate passed last fall. Instead, House Republicans have voted repeatedly on budgets that will never be followed and similarly doomed attempts at repealing Obama priorities.

Valencia: When I was at Frontera Grill, the best chef I ever worked for was Tracey Vowell. She's a very tall, loud-mouthed woman from Louisiana who can command the respect unanimously of all these Mexican cooks. There's always this (grabbing) game that goes on in every kitchen, universally.

You would serve this on the same occasions, and with the same food, as you would a fine red Bordeaux or Burgundy. It's that good. And it's worth its $22.95 asking price.

TBI can worsen the symptoms of people who already have PTSD or who go on to develop it because of, say, a near-fatal bomb explosion.

Not long ago Scott was able to change units almost the way hockey coaches do lines and defensive pairings. Not with the injuries, though. And, I think it's starting to have an impact on their brutal second quarters. The Cavs are dead last in second-quarter scoring with 20.3 points per game. Any wonder why they are needing big fourth-quarter comebacks?

Speaking of Kiwanuka, I’m late in mentioning something I wanted to note last week: his standing up and answering questions about the motorcycle accident in which he and his brother were involved. We’re often so quick to point out when a player dodges reporters and a sensitive subject but sometimes slow to note when a guy stands up and fields the tough questions. Kiwanuka did that last week and that’s commendable.

The judge ordered that plaintiffs should be reimbursed for attorneys' fees.
"Demand for services literally has never been greater," Ludeman said. "But the good news is that the private sector is in a great position to do something about it."

The Blazers (8-9) have lost a season-high four consecutive games, six of their last eight and have fallen below .500 for the first time this season.

Just because it's "not against the law" doesn't mean it's "OK to do" or "a nice treat" for wife or family ("Kamenetz, council members got tickets from developers," May 2). Maybe I'm just jealous. After all, no corporation has given my family Ravens tickets recently — or ever.
A family member of the Reckleins said early Wednesday that Nevenner was a cousin.

Brian Wilson, their black-bearded closer, threw the final pitch each time. He eschewed the roller-coaster ride with a perfect ninth inning and thrust his arms in the air after Nelson Cruz waved through a slider to end it.

The hearing ended without any action. Rep. Olson said the committee would continue to accept written remarks through Friday.
Healthy sperm and a robust sperm count improve your odds that a single sperm will survive its ultra-marathon journey and meet an eligible egg. And sperm have different functions. Some act like blockers to stop other sperm, which makes "survival of the fittest" sense for animals with multiple mates during rutting season, while others are sprinters designed to beat a path to the egg. More than half of a guy's sperm are the sprinter/swimmer type and those oval heads need to be strong enough to break through an egg's tough outer layer.

Kansas City has long leaned toward the more progressive side of understanding such matters. In the mid-1950s, the zoo was noted for being the only place in the U.S. where the elephants had hair. Other zoos singed it off with blowtorches, probably so people could ride them without the bristle.
SAN FRANCISCO -- On Facebook, most people make friends the old-fashioned way -- by sending a request to be added to someone's posse of pals. Now, an Australian marketing company hopes to save you time and energy by simply buying you a few thousand buddies.

The Cubs don't want to take any chances of Clevenger aggravating the injury, which is not considered serious at this time. His move to the disabled list is expected to take place before Saturday's game.
To Gantes' defenders, this is a story of a good businessman who borrowed big at the wrong moment, just as real estate prices plunged and recession-haunted diners decided to stay home.

The new collective bargaining agreement will punish teams that pay a luxury tax in multiple years. The Blazers would like to avoid that.

The one piece of his itinerary that has gotten the most attention is the visit planned for Iowa in two weeks.

Andrew Luck, Stanford, 6-4, 234: Luck is a complete prospect with experience, a history of production, a feel for the game, size, athleticism, top intangibles and toughness. He doesn't have an arm like John Elway's, but it's good enough — similar to Manning's, and he throws as accurately. His movement skills are similar to Jay Cutler's and he can throw on the run. He can take a hit like Cutler. Luck has shown he can work through his progressions and find second and third options. He has produced for four years and is considered NFL-ready. There is very little chance Luck will be a bust, and an excellent chance he will be a Pro Bowl caliber player.

This definition is a problem for many people. They belong to a religion but they don't really believe or practice everything that the religion teaches. There may be some beliefs or practices that they don't follow. For, example, a 1998 study of Presbyterians found that only two-thirds of its members attended Sunday worship services "every week" or "nearly every week" Similarly, almost a third of its members don't agree that "Jesus will return to earth some day." Remember, this survey is among members of the church. We have earlier discussed the fact that evangelical Christians beat their wives and divorce their spouses about as often as their non-Christian neighbors do.

Of Jewish heritage, he had to fight to become an Orthodox priest in the 1970s and was suspended for almost two years in the '80s for "politically motivated dissent," until a visiting President Reagan met with him in Moscow and the Kremlin decided it was too scandalous for the priest to stay out of service.

Watson was born and raised in Philadelphia. In her early years she found a love for dance, music and children, which led her to pursue her bachelor's degree in Special Education from West Chester University. Her interest in helping others prompted her journey to obtain an master's in School Counseling from Loyola University. Watson uses a variety of approaches to positively impact student reading at City Neighbors: an annual 25-book challenge for each student, one-on-one conferences to help students select books that are just right for them, and the occasional special focus on poetry and plays. This year in particular, she has used arts integration as a way to tap into the students' love and understanding of reading through bookmaking, movement, dance, and drama.

But the candidate did not unveil any new policy proposals tailored to women. Instead, speaking at several women-owned businesses with scores of women behind him as a backdrop, Romney hit many of the same themes that he has been for months: what he views as Obama's ineffectual $787-billion government stimulus program, financial regulations that he says have slowed lending and business growth, and a burgeoning deficit that he says has made it difficult for the economy to recover.

We contemplated including the park's Japanese Tea Garden, which was built in 1894, but ultimately decided it was less notable for its food than its design and age.

The new backup quarterback for the Jets was booed at Yankee Stadium when shown on the video board Sunday night -- even though he was wearing a Yankees cap.
DG: Matt Carpenter is likely going to get a look at other positions this spring, and he's shown the athleticism to handle the outfield. He way to crack the majors is going to be as a utility player and lefthanded bat off the bench. As lefthanded hitter, he could easily spell Freese at third sometimes. John Mabry had a good turn as a Cardinal in a similar role. Zack Cox could return to Class AA to start this coming season and then slingshot up to Class AAA Memphis and play ... well, wherever the playing time is available. That could be second base. That could be third base. Exit? By trade, maybe. But because they are blocked? Well ... When you consider the positions they can play, it's not impossible that David Freese, Cox, Carpenter and Kolten Wong would all fit on the same roster. I bet production and performance answers who plays where and at what level before the Cardinals ever have to consider fitting them on the same team.

Role: The former No. 1 overall draft pick will start the season exactly as he has lingered most of this professional career -- injured. Oden, who has played in just 82 games since being drafted in 2007, is unsure when he will return to the court as he continues to rehab from December knee surgery. When healthy, Oden is a potential difference-maker who can wreak havoc on defense and provide a needed post threat on offense. But his health remains a big if, and he is arguably the biggest question mark entering the season.

The 2010 healthcare reform law gave states until Jan. 1, 2014, to create "exchanges" in which individuals and small businesses could shop for insurance policies. If the states don't, the federal government will operate exchanges for them. The requirement poses a quandary for lawmakers who oppose the federal law: Should they start working on an exchange, or count on the law being repealed by the Supreme Court or by a new Republican-controlled Congress and White House in 2013? The answer is that each state should set up an exchange regardless of how its lawmakers feel about "Obamacare," because it would help ameliorate the very real problems consumers face in the health insurance market.

In particular, researchers point to prisoners of war on terror-related activities as potential subjects for the fMRI lie-detecting methods. Greely and Wolpe agree that there is "little doubt" the U.S. government has been studying them.

You can bake stuffing separately in a casserole dish - many cooks prefer it - but remember that it will not take as long to cook as the turkey.

Our ride began peacefully, humming along under the incandescent haze of the slumbering city. Then the buildings petered out, along with the streetlamps. The van climbed toward the Andes, its windows frosted and headlights flashing around switchbacks.

Take those pandas. Our first task was to vaccinate the three of them. The zoo's resident mama panda, Ruth, had given birth to triplets.
