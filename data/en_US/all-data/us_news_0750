So why is Lynn's fastball so effective? It averages 92.3 mph. That's a nice number, but it isn't Nolan Ryan. The Lynn fastball has life, and movement, and he's hitting his spots with it. With the two-seamer, Lynn has a hard sink. That's why he gets so many ground balls. But then he can switch to the four-seam fastball, pitch up in the zone, and get swings and misses.
In Orakpo's room, police found nine unmarked vials (eight in a refrigerator) as well as syringes, three of which were used.

Its abandonment would also mean the rescue strategy pursued by leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel of forcing Greece to cut its budgets relentlessly has been a failure.

Unfortunately, the current administration has done nothing to change this arrangement. Obama loyalists have simply replaced Bush loyalists in key legal positions. Like their predecessors, they are in a position to generate impressive-looking legal documents to support presidential assertions of unilateral power at home and abroad. Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush repeatedly made use of this legal tactic after they lost control of Congress in 1994 and 2006, respectively. It will require remarkable self-restraint from Obama to reject this time-tested formula for success during political adversity.

Banks benefited from dozens of other programs instituted by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, from the purchase of mortgage-backed securities to the bailout of home-lending giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

Apparently, the picture "loophole" was enough of an excuse for the IRS to drop its investigation.

Consumer Reports, which in 2010 refused to recommend the iPhone 4 because of a flaw in its antenna (some called that "antennagate"), tested the new iPad and found that it could reach temperatures as high as 116 degrees -- 13 degrees hotter than the iPad 2. That seemed alarming at first, but in its article, complete with thermal images, the writer acknowledged, "When it was at its hottest, it felt very warm but not especially uncomfortable if held for a brief period." On its Web page, the publication says that it's "not likely" that its findings will affect its decision to recommend the product.

RB Brandon Jacobs. At the tail end of a 10-yard catch-and-run, he was standing on the sideline as three Pats who failed to bring him down were lying on top of one another. It reminded me of a game against the Buccaneers in 2006 — Jacobs’ second season — when he left six Buccaneers on the ground as he stood on the sideline and let out (forgive this homerish-sounding phrase but it’s the best way to describe it) a mighty roar. When I saw the play Sunday and watched the reaction of the Giants’ sideline, I knew this was a much different Jacobs than we’d seen in recent weeks. He made a promise he’d be back to his old ways and he kept it. Not, only that, he provided plenty of help with some big chips on passing plays: one to put DE Andre Carter on his back and two on back-to-back pass plays in the third quarter that went for 18 and 30 yards. Plus, he slowed down Carter’s rush on the game-winning touchdown.

Although many passengers are grateful to the agency for protecting them and are generally supportive of its efforts, the federal screeners have no shortage of vocal detractors. Sommer Gentry, a math professor from Annapolis, Md., and an outspoken critic of the agency, believes that in the past decade, the TSA has made air travel miserable.

"And his books continue to show children that their resilient side can win out."

Turner used a .243-caliber hunting rifle to shoot Singh. The bullet struck him in an area that wasn't protected by his ballistic vest. It tore through one of his kidneys and into his colon, before fragmenting enough to leave a 3- to 4-inch hole in his back. Singh had told jurors he laid on the ground unable to move his legs, and that he used his elbows to drag himself back behind the tree as bullets continued to whiz by.
Agnew made his triumphant entrance onto the national scene at the same moment and proved a worthy competitor to Wallace in the contest to bash the eggheads. A little-known governor of Maryland only halfway through his first term, Agnew had been a poor student who dropped out of Johns Hopkins and later returned to get a University of Baltimore law degree in night school. A surprise choice for the ticket, Agnew helped blunt Wallace's own foray into the rich vein of white, working-class voters who resented the Great Society and the civil rights movement's success. Wallace clucked happily about Agnew's speeches: "They're talking like we do."
"All the respect in the world for these two fine gentlemen. Neither have a ring, and both could have lobbied for a trade to a contender, but they decided to do something more than winning. They showed many young men on our team (Kyrie, Tristan, Harris, Gee, Casspi, Samuels, Sloan) that TRUST and LEADERSHIP are the two components that make a team successful. They both understood that if they taught them these priceless intangibles, that they would become a successful team in the future and would do it in the right way. Very selfless actions by these two guys, and both were fun to watch when they were on their games as well. Nothing but the best for them. Thanks Antawn. Thanks Anthony. You helped build a foundation for a team that will be competitive for years to come!"

Because of the dramatic weather, every mile up the road is equivalent to traveling 150 miles toward the North Pole. That means we passed, in just under 8 miles, an astonishing number of climate zones -- from northern hardwood forest to arctic.
Following the two-hour, 40-minute surgery, which had begun at 8 a.m., Hendrix's kidney was put on a charter plane to Chicago. From there it was flown to San Francisco, then on to Sacramento, where it was taken by ambulance to the hospital at the University of California-Davis.
In downtown Los Gatos, painter Steve Grabowski was fielding questions Saturday from Kinkade fans at the Los Gatos Museum Gallery about whether the value of Kinkade's work would shoot up after his death. Grabowski, who knew Kinkade's work well but didn't even know he lived in the Bay Area, called Kinkade "a very highly skilled artist," but one who directed those talents toward commercial success, rather than aesthetic greatness.
We will write about each leader separately, beginning with today's story on Carlos Kalmar, the athletic, demanding music director of the Oregon Symphony. Without question, Kalmar has succeeded at what he was hired to do: transform the playing of the Oregon Symphony. But his fierce focus has come at a cost.
The plaintiffs include Mohamed Sheikh Abdirahman Kariye, the religious leader of the Portland area's largest mosque.
Carrey plays Carl Allen, an L.A. loan officer at a drab bank, stuck with a goon of a superior (Rhys Darby, very funny). Carl can't get out of his surly, self-pitying rut, three long years after his breakup. For the first 20 minutes of "Yes Man," which was loosely based on Scottish comedian Danny Wallace's book, you think you're in for it. Carrey forces the laughs, and the character's an uninteresting, sour fellow. Then comes Terence Stamp, in his first genuinely funny screen appearance, as a self-help guru who challenges his followers to say "yes" to every single thing that comes their way. Carl tries it, and before long he meets Allison (Deschanel), a bohemian L.A. polyglot who's in a band called Munchausen By Proxy, and who teaches classes in "jogging photography," i.e., taking photos while jogging.
Still, Gru—voiced by Steve Carell by way of Bela Lugosi and looking like a fuller-faced relative of the food critic Anton Ego in "Ratatouille"—is a funny guy. And he becomes a more interesting guy when he crosses paths with a trio of orphan girls who appoint him their father and melt his heart. The film was directed by Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud from a script by Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul. It looks so stylish that thinking about its plot is strictly optional.
Stotik is back to remind us of his genius with a new show at a new dealer, Laura Russo Gallery.
Moments into the movie, it's clear that what separates this ghost story from standard-issue horror is sound: The creaking, the moaning and even the silences of the large but unremarkable home where Renai and Josh Lambert (Ms. Byrne and Mr. Wilson) move with their two young boys, start working on the nerve endings immediately; Robert Cross's sound design is an entity all its own. The house fairly mutters with malevolent intent, loudly enough that anyone with sense would up and move, with or without the furniture. Which the Lamberts essentially do: Despite residing in the kind of movie where characters often do the inexplicable in order to thrust themselves into the jaws of the supernatural, they get the heck out, though not until their son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) has fallen into what seems to be a coma. Changing houses doesn't help, though. Strange stuff continues. Dalton is diagnosed as being in something other than a coma. And his brother, Foster (Andrew Astor), can't sleep. "I don't like it," Tucker says, "when Dalton walks around at night." Uh-oh.

It's the next generation - the baby boomers - who will first feel the impact of this current "payroll tax cut," as well as the impact of longevity on the Social Security system. There's simply no way we boomers will receive the benefits that my dad is reaping from Social Security.
A decade and a half later, George is long gone, but the confluence that Kennedy imagined is very much entrenched. Presidential candidates routinely appear on ABC's "The View" or "The Oprah Winfrey Show," sharing not their policies but their narratives.

Now a student at the University of Arizona, McElroy began as a computer-science major, but he switched to studying art. He likes sketching. Each line, he said, has individual character that contributes to a complete story when the picture is done.
“It’s just a miserable feeling to see it,” he said. “I didn’t think it was that bad, I was hoping maybe he’d caught it funny or maybe he’d sprained it or something. But coming in here after the game and finding out the news, it’s the worst news we could have gotten.”
“The River” was the fifth Springsteen album to get song-by-song concert treatment this year, following “Born To Run,” “Born In the U.S.A.,” “The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle” (also played just once, at the first of the two Garden shows, Saturday) and “Darkness On the Edge Of Town.” All have been satisfying, though due to its length, its stylistic variety and the number of rarely played songs on it, “The River” was the most breathtaking of all.
Fast forward a few years and Shmuel Marcus, as rabbi of Chabad of Cypress, was hosting a holiday party for the community and Bentzi, a guitarist, was performing with his friends and a few of his brothers.

As guests entered the former Air Force hangar that is now home to a world-class collection of vintage aircraft and space vehicles, they were greeted by Sinatra songs playing on the sound system and bars serving such back-in-the-day libations as whiskey sours and Manhattans.

Taking advantage of acting classes, and jumping into whatever productions they could participate in, Barbara and Bob started working toward their goal. Barbara had second thoughts: "I couldn't even say my lines in my second grade play." Both admit they also had to get over their initial fear of being on stage, as well as get accustomed to the "mystique" of being on a stage. Both were surprised how much work was entailed in even a small part in a production; but they also agree the hard work is worth it.

As the anniversary of bin Laden's death approaches on Wednesday, I have been going back over my notes of these messages. I found some unpublished passages that show how bin Laden's legacy is an ironic mix: His movement is largely destroyed, but his passion for a purer and more Islamic government in the Arab world is partly succeeding. In that sense, the West shouldn't be too quick to claim victory.

Even with the ebullient Winslet doing the pining -- she's the best excuse to see "The Holiday" -- you wonder if Meyers was so focused on establishing her main characters as frustrated, lonely and wanting that she forgot about the "interesting" part. Once Iris finally lands in sunny, smog-free L.A. and Amanda settles into her provincial vacation cottage outside London, the fish-out-of-water montages begin. Here's Iris playing air-guitar with a pillow and marveling at the size of Amanda's plasma TV. There's Amanda having the devil's own time driving on the "wrong" side of the road. Amanda finds love with Iris' dashing book-editor brother Graham (Jude Law), whose big secret provides the requisite third-act complication.

But presumably out-of-state companies usually do hire predominantly local workers, either directly or through subcontractors. It would be highly inconvenient and expensive not to.

But the truth is that taxpayers do quite well by the student loan business. If you think about it just a little, it's not hard to figure out why: The U.S. government pays almost nothing to borrow money that it lends out to college students at much higher interest rates. The current interest rate on a subsidized Stafford loan is 3.4 percent; on an unsubsidized Stafford loan the interest rate is 6.8 percent.
Although his initial tweet said he did not apply to be a "deputy" officer, his explanation in following tweets seem to indicate that he is not applying for any sort of officer position in general:

The last-minute defection of black lawmakers was unfortunate in that it revealed a persistent if seldom-discussed lack of common cause between the African-American and gay communities. Although both groups historically have been victims of bigotry and discrimination, many blacks resent comparisons between the civil rights movement and efforts to achieve equality for gays and lesbians. In fact, a recent poll by Annapolis-based Gonzales Research and Marketing Strategies found the state as a whole evenly divided on the question of gay marriage but black voters strongly against it, 59 percent to 41 percent.
Mostly in construction, trucking and landscaping, these workers depend on their employers for their hours, their work sites and their livelihoods, according to U.S. Sen.

Rise before dawn. Get to the Griffith Observatory parking lot (which is free but fills fast). Start at the Charlie Turner Trailhead, just north of the lot, and hike uphill. You're climbing Mt. Hollywood, whose peak (1,625 feet) offers staggering views. It's a three-mile round trip through scrub and chaparral, the pines of Berlin Forest and the shady oasis of Dante's View. From the mountaintop on a clear day, you can see the sun rise to the east and a sliver of Pacific to the west. Almost every day, you'll get an eyeful of the Los Angeles basin, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Mountains and the Hollywood sign on nearby Mt. Lee. (There's no hike to the Hollywood sign, and no access to it. Do this instead.) As the mist lifts from the ridges, listen to the birdsong — and the Koreans. Dozens of Korean Americans like to begin their days with hikes here. So does City Councilman Tom LaBonge, who hollers greetings in their language and carries a football on his dawn hikes. He's been on this trail daily since 1978.

As the first sounds of explosions ripped through the capital early on Sunday, Afghans rushed for shelter and the U.S. Embassy's "duck and cover" alarm echoed through the diplomatic neighborhood that appeared to be the hardest hit.
Outside of the Capitol, voting for someone else is a felony subject to up to three years' imprisonment. In the Assembly, where the stakes of a single vote are significantly higher, it is a rule that is widely ignored. Members routinely ask their desk mates to cover for them when they are away from the floor, usually with instructions on how to vote on specific bills. But if they leave their keys in their voting machines while away from the desk, they risk having a party-line voting recorded, whether they like it or not - as Hayashi discovered to her chagrin.

In his heart of hearts, Mike Martz would like to be flinging the ball the way he did with the Greatest Show on Turf. No secret there. In fact, most coaches would. That's the best way to win in today's NFL. But the Bears don't have what it takes to do that. They are set up to win another way. Martz realizes that now. But that doesn't mean he won't continue to push to try to do it the way he used to. The essence of good coaching is being able to win with different styles, based on the personnel that's available to you. The way Martz is calling games is a testament to his coaching ability.

See, it isn't enough simply to ban employers from using a particular word or phrase in their help-wanted ads. Obviously, a business could carry out the invidious practice sub rosa.

No better acting and writing on basic cable: Walton Goggins as Boyd Crowder, Neal McDonough as Quarles, Jeremy Davies as Dickie Bennett, Joelle Carter as Ava Crowder and Raymond Barry as Arlo Givens are a few of the standouts in a wonderful cast.

Tom Price was a New York City musician, but his connection to New Jersey was real. I remember catching Ff, his punk band, at the Court Tavern in what must have been the very late '90s, and marveling at how the locals went bananas for everything he did.

He was known as a generous guy as well as a terrific singer and songwriter, and he went out of his way to mentor younger musicians. He was somebody to build a scene around.
The current board includes two executives, Chief Executive Wally Rhines and company President Gregory Hinckley.

Stern's response raises obvious questions: Don't children have fathers? Aren't family responsibilities capable of taking time from men as well as women?

When you walk through the lounge, past the open kitchen and into the main dining room, you feel as if you're in someone's home. A wall of windows in back overlooks a manicured garden filled with ferns, magnolias and camellias. The interior feels like a midcentury ranch house with Japanese overtones. The weekly changing menu from chef and co-owner Wendy Brucker offers a sophisticated take on California comfort food. That might include roast chicken roulade stuffed with kale, persimmon and pomegranates, and served with sweet potato gratin and seared mustard greens; or local swordfish with beurre blanc, mashed potatoes, grilled peppers, green beans and an apple-celery-caper relish.

Romney ended up on the defensive and by Monday night's debate, Gingrich was back in command. He earned a standing ovation when he labeled Democratic President Obama "the best food stamp president in American history." The clip became the centerpiece of a television ad that began airing Wednesday as Gingrich worked to cast himself as the Republican with the best chance of beating Obama in the fall, stealing a page from Romney's playbook.
It's not easy for a writer to bring together multiple characters from multiple movies and blend them into a cohesive whole. It's equally difficult for a director to juggle the egos of several performers who have already been stars in their own films, some of them behemoth blockbuster franchises, and ask them to play along as supporting members of a team.
In Ferguson-Florissant, Superintendent Jeff Spiegel, 55, had the right combination of age and experience to also make retirement attractive this year. So the school board put its own lucrative offer on the table.
The Masson, served over ice in a big wine glass, is made with Bombay Sapphire, lemon juice and simple syrup as a sweetener. The key ingredient is muddled basil, which adds a surprising kick.

I know I tweeted this but it didn’t make the paper or the site, I don’t think, so just wanted to mention here: the last time the Giants were involved in a scoreless tie at the half was Oct. 3, 2004 against the Packers in Green Bay. They won that game 14-7 thanks to a late touchdown pass from Kurt Warner to Jeremy Shockey. The other thing I recall from that game was Brett Favre chucking a fourth-down ball he had no business throwing for a TD over Frank Walker. Favre also had no business being in the game. He had suffered a concussion.

Nash will be an unrestricted free agent and, even at 38, will tempt plenty of teams. He had an outstanding season for Phoenix, averaging 12.5 points and 10.7 assists while tying his career-best by shooting 53.1 percent from the field, a remarkable percentage for a point guard. He also took a talent-challenged Phoenix team to the cusp of making the playoffs.

Rasmus represented a metrics darling as a rookie but backslid last season. Dewan's system ranked him plus-5 on balls hit to shallow or medium center field but a minus-12 on deep fly balls. Rasmus ranked 28th among major-league center fielders last spring. The measure also squared with La Russa's insistence that Rasmus man a deeper station.

Even while prospects for enacting President Barack Obama's jobs plan have dimmed, Republican backing has grown for a long-term transportation bill to boost employment. Transportation and road-building industries, especially the beleaguered construction industry, are also pressuring lawmakers to make a multi-year commitment of federal funds. Without that, states and private investors will have trouble financing large infrastructure projects.

Although no Republican presidential candidate has won in California since George H.W. Bush in 1988, Gingrich told the crowd he would make California competitive in the general election. “I believe, if we are prepared to campaign everywhere, that we can put California absolutely right in play, and we can do it by reaching out to everybody across the whole state,” he said.
As with all areas of education, funding for football varies widely. Homewood-Flossmoor, for example, budgeted about $133,000 for its program this year, while Morris, a school on the southwestern fringe of the Chicago area, budgeted $70,000. Taft, on Chicago's Northwest Side, expects to spend only $11,000.
"It was a huge drive," said Jennings, who also caught a 20-yard touchdown pass. "We haven't had one like that at the end in a while. It was very quiet in the huddle, actually. You could see everybody was focused. It's great to see what we could do at the end like that."
My biggest concern is what it bodes for the future, Krauss said. When you see a visionary and consensus-builder such as Lugar fail in a re-election bid, it may discourage people with similar skills from seeking office. We need to inspire and encourage young leaders, not disillusion them. We desperately need them.
Quick Take 2: So State Sen. Gary Siplin is back with his droopy-drawers bill. During the past five years, the Orlando Democrat has repeatedly tried to pass this law to get kids to pull their pants up — we really need a statewide law for this? — with his legislative peers shooting him down each time. If he fails again, Siplin will look a lot like a one-trick pony who can't even pull off his one trick.

I'm thinking this is why Kelly gave the Pac-12 title trophy to outgoing president Richard Lariviere. Nice gesture. But the thing is a booby prize compared to the Rose Bowl, and what Kelly needs on his résumé is a BCS victory, not a tainted bit of hardware made easy, in large part, because Reggie Bush and Co. cheated a few years ago.
In fact, the Winter Park Republican is not only looking to cast blame, he's pretty sure he's found the culprit: Barack Obama.
The man tells police he was out walking when he was approached by an unknown man who asked for a cigarette. When the victim told the man he did not have a cigarette, the other man pulled out a gun and started shooting.
I'll admit it: I was nervous when I pulled up to Orange High School in Pepper Pike one evening last week. Several people had assured me my snail-like pace wouldn't matter, that I'd fit in somewhere on the spectrum from beginner to elite, but I just couldn't believe them. Years of being overtaken in triathlon races have done a number on my swimming self-esteem.
“I couldn’t reel them back in during the huddles and it kept snowballing,” Rice said. “Maalik Wayns just kept the pressure on them and made all the right moves.”
Sinead O'Connor, the intense Irish singer-songwriter who has turned into something of a tabloid freak in recent months, announced on her website that she's splitting from new husband Barry Herridge, whom she says she loves very much but has been made "terribly unhappy" by those around him who disapprove of the match.
The ambiguity is refreshing. And despite the complicated emotional story at the center of this film, the Dardennes, who wrote and directed, have opted to handle it all with a minimalist narrative style. Only a little of Cyril's back story is sketched in. Nothing of what is driving Samantha is revealed. Conversations are concise; much is left unsaid.

The big question is whether advertisers will come to the party and how much they will spend. Google releases little information about YouTube's financial health, but it's been steadily working to migrate ads from the margins of its pages and into actual videos. Its ad system, called TrueView, allows viewers to skip an ad after the first few seconds.

The fact that Fireman's Fund survived is due largely to J.B. Levison, who headed the company's Marine Division and later became its president for two decades. He persuaded policyholders to accept a payoff plan that gave a large measure of relief to customers in the wrecked city. The plan saved the company.
Nor is it exactly the only problem with property tax laws (and how they are administered) that has been uncovered in recent months. As The Sun has previously documented, Maryland's property tax credit programs have shortcomings, too. In one case, the law has fueled massive inequities in property tax bills that have been particularly advantageous to the wealthy. In another case, the system has caused people to purchase homes they could not afford (while failing to help others who qualified for assistance because the program wasn't sufficiently publicized).

Heed that title; this isn't the kind of album you crank up at wild parties. Rather, it's perfect for sitting back and savoring jazz luminary Krall's sensuous voice and delicate touch on the piano as she alternates between balladry ("Where or When") and bossa nova (a gender-switching "The Boy from Ipanema").

One thing is certain: The city must reduce its loan payments. That's why staffers are working to refinance the note that the city owes on the sewage plant — a $16.5 million outstanding debt — and looking at other loans. In all, the city next year would have to budget $1.7 million, or nearly 25 percent of its total income, repaying loans for a sewage plant, water and sewer lines and City Hall if nothing is refinanced.
"We're certainly selling a lot of cars to people who didn't traditionally look at Ford products," Herrick said.

Asked exactly what makes the ball different, Kuroda said, “It can also be a weather factor. It’s so humid in Japan the ball kind of sticks a little bit. But I think in general, the Japanese baseball sticks to your fingers more than the American ball. I think the size of the ball is pretty much the same. I didn’t really feel any difference.”

As long as there is baggage handling, there will be prayer in airports. Beset by world unrest and security worries, travelers will also pray. But perhaps praying in an airport could be something more than seeking God's protection - as important as that is.

Sure enough, there are only two ways he can do it. Take Southern Cal's Matt Kalil at No. 4, then ask him to move from left tackle to right tackle. That's not a value pick or an impact pick for a touchdown-starved team.

While Williams has done little to minimize the Kings' lack of frontcourt size and chronic shooting woes, his vision, playmaking and unselfishness have facilitated coach Keith Smart's ongoing attempts to break the team of its dribble-heavy, sluggish tempo.

only 4 games since All-Pro QB Kurt Warner left football to dance with the stars, among other things, and the team already is pondering turning to a 3rd leading man for the offense.

Yes. I attended a lot of the great, great meetings at places like the Albert Hall in London and the huge Labor rallies. And I remember the speeches, and I used to come home and try to do imitations of women who were speaking and I would give a long dissertation on something like the public lavatories or something ridiculous like that. Because the way that people presented their stories — whatever they were pitching for — I think that encouraged me as a kid to take on characters and to be people other than myself. Because that's how you begin as an actor, I think, is impersonating or taking on the physical attributes of people you watch. And you suck it in and use it later, but it's all part of your general experience.

Neo-conservatives had a more culturally deterministic theory. Many of them had been poor during the Depression. Economic stress had not undermined the family then.

In addition to taxpayers, Maryland counties will also benefit from the failure of the House to enact a pension shift on Maryland counties.

For people with hard-to-control hypertension, a sudden, big dose of caffeine may boost blood pressure because caffeine constricts blood vessels. But decaf is fine in that respect. And even caffeinated coffee doesn't increase blood pressure much once you drink it for a week or so, said Van Dam. In fact, the caffeine in coffee seems to have less of an effect on blood pressure than the caffeine in colas because there are so many other substances in coffee that have the opposite effect physiologically from caffeine.

The speed of China's DVD pirates can be astonishing: Just four days after the latest Harry Potter film premiered in theaters worldwide in November -- including in China -- the boy wizard had flown in from bootleg factories in the southern city of Guangzhou to DVD shops across Beijing.
Such global machinations now play out in their monthly electric bill on Southeast Sherman.
Santorum made no mention of Romney in a 12-minute speech in which he extolled the people he had met during the campaign and said he was inspired by their stories of struggle and faith.
Every fifth day, Bochy has had the luxury of counting on Cain to give the Giants a great chance to win.
First, the bad news -- because seemingly no Blazers game can go by without some. Starting center Marcus Camby (bruise) and starting small forward Nicolas Batum (strain) suffered separate right shoulder injuries in the first half and did return after halftime. McMillan said both players were "pretty sore" and he was unsure whether either player would be available when the Blazers (13-14) play host to the Golden State Warriors tonight.
It has been too long since I last visited The Mad Greek on Cedar Hill in Cleveland Heights. It has always been one of my favorite places for authentic flavors of Greece and India.
He was the state champion on five of the six events and was the all-around champion.
At $2.75 for each $100 of assessed valuation, the Ladue School District has the lowest school operating tax rate in St. Louis County. It cannot be raised without voter approval. Most other school districts in St. Louis and surrounding counties have the ability to roll up their tax rate if the school board votes to do so, but Ladue could not because of state statutes.
The Broadway cast preformed a concert version of the show in front of 3,000 hard-core Fela fans. "It was unbelievable," says Hendel. "The show ended with a 20-minute encore with the family performing a brilliant song about everyone coming together. Femi evoked his father's presence and blessed everyone in the cast."
"It’s important that gang guys know they don’t get to make the laws," Bradley said. "They don’t get to make the laws in their own territory."

Already renewed: Nothing in this category because the Alphabet Network isn't confirming any renewals (no matter how certain they might be) until its May 15 announcement.
Are police planning any more arrests?
Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement that Silver informed him in July he was leaving, after it became clear Congress was not likely to extend a key section of the loan program that offered guarantees to renewable energy companies. The program, funded under the 2009 economic stimulus law, expired on Friday.
With the deaths last year of Lucian Freud and Richard Hamilton, David Hockney suddenly catapulted into position as England's leading painter. Although the cultivated image of a dandified English schoolboy in white pants, mismatched socks, polka-dot bow tie and beanie is long out of date for an artist who, at 74, is identified with iconic 1960s paintings of Los Angeles swimming pools, the thought is a bit of a shock. Still, the timing couldn't be better for this enjoyable and well-sourced book, which — like Hockney's own work — is both conversational and perceptive.
A: Yup, you don't want to go back to the Garden, where they've re-loaded the confetti bins. Wednesday will offer some insight into whether the Heat are as focused as they were through the opening three rounds last season, when they didn't allow a series to go beyond five games.
