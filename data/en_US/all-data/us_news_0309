I disagree with Al White's article on Pinewood Derby cars. As a parent and a teacher, I can tell you that kids gain positive life lessons when they lose and parents still love and support them. I always thought the Pinewood Derby was an imperfect competition, as are the rewards for the most sales of Girl Scout cookies, which are taken to offices by an adult to sell. What are we teaching kids? Not coming up as number one means you are a failure?

For interior linemen, it’s something that Jets head coach Rex Ryan has said time and time again over the past few years. It doesn’t get much better than Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata. Similarly are Miami’s Paul Soliai and more recently, Detroit’s Ndamukong Suh. On the outside — judging solely by the past few years — Brian Orakpo and Jason Pierre-Paul define the mold, and overall versatility, that defensive coordinators are looking for at the position.

The time is recorded as each team exits, and team members have to decide which coordinate to find first.

Talking of virtual worlds, I should mention Second Life. I've never been a huge fan of these online worlds -- my foray into The Sims Online in 2003 invited howls of derision from more experienced denizens -- but it's not hard to see their appeal. Not everyone lives in a thriving, socially inclusive metropolis, and so Second Life et al offers those starved of company a great outlet. But as graphics and connectivity improve, I'd expect to see the cellphone revolution lead the growth in virtual worlds -- perhaps even blur the boundaries between the two. After all, both are about connecting to a social Web that binds us together. I don't necessarily think this will be all good, but good things will come out of it.

I have often wondered what it would be like to know I was dying. We all are, you know. Religion runs the risk of missing this. Often it either focuses on a different world after death, and so misses the impact of living here and now in a way informed by the reality of our death, or fixated on how to perform the details of this life, its proscriptions, beliefs and rituals, shrinking the space humans have in which to sit back and really feel the great reality of death; that we are dying and on some level, for even the most profound believer, death brings with it annihilation, nonbeing as we know it.

The situation might be able to be straightened out if both girls talk with each mom and try to explain what happened that has them so upset with each other. Who knows, there may be a misunderstanding that the two of you could help with to perhaps mend the friendship. If not, give the girls time off from each other. In the future, they may or may not repair the closeness that they once shared for each other. If they don't, try to accept it and not make a big deal out of it. Don't make them feel guilty. For now, there's no reason why the two of you cannot continue your own friendship.

The one in my house is from Advanced Home Systems in Phoenix. It "knows" when your electric utility's rates - which fluctuate several times every day so you actually pay less at times the fewest people are running their air-conditioners and taking hot showers - are lowest. To save on air-conditioning costs, for instance, it will automatically lower your thermostat overnight as low as you'll allow so your house will cool off while rates are at their lowest. Your home will retain enough of that cold air to keep it comfortable the next afternoon, when the computer will raise the temperature slightly so you don't use as much electricity when rates are at their highest.

Among a group of prisoners waiting to die is a grim-faced little boy who, like the hero of "Oliver," relieves his anxiety, not to mention the discomfort of his rope-wrapped neck, by bursting into song. When other prisoners take up the boy's plaintive melody, a British officer rushes off to tell his superior, cryptically, "They've started to sing, sir," to which the superior replies, with equally cryptic pithiness: "Finally."
øThough they likely missed their mark, exploding harmlessly in the sand, the era of aerial bombing had begun, a century ago this month, in Libya. One irony of the recent overthrow and death of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, following NATO warplanes bombing his convoy in October, is that Libya illustrates the advances in aerial bombing technology that transformed warfare over the last century.

The questions the trials prompted are the usual ones that pop up before every major championship: Are the horses jumping too much and too hard? What about the time frame, more than four months out from the Games? Who should be excused from the trials? Is objective better than subjective, and vice versa? Are the trials needed at all to produce a medal-winning team?

-- If I had to guess, the rotation goes: CC Sabathia, Michael Pineda, Hiroki Kuroda, Ivan Nova and A.J. Burnett. While Nova's ascent was a highlight of the Yankees' rotation last season, there is still some doubt as to whether he can miss enough bats. Meanwhile, Pineda has shown that he has the stuff to make big league batters swing and miss. That skillset belongs in the No. 2 spot. Kuroda profiles as a typical, steady No. 3, which leaves Nova to the fourth spot.

But it's a tough task to be ready and deliver whenever (they call your number).

I anticipate the latter scenario. Yadi might command an annual salary upwards of $10 million on the free agent market, and I'm not sure the Cards can afford to pay that to a guy who has slugged above .400 only once in an eight-year career. He'll be 30 when his next contract begins, which is not young for a catcher; how many more seasons will he be able to start 130 games a year? In my opinion, his value his peaked. Whoever signs him to his next deal will likely end up overpaying. A reasonable deal would be 3 years, $25 million; I wouldn't go beyond 4 years, $32 million.

I applaud the affordable housing development proposed by REACH Community Development. The location at 231st and Cherry Street is near the light rail station and nearby shopping is within walking distance. However, for anyone who has to walk to ride a bicycle on 231st Avenue in either direction, there are no sidewalks, minimal bike pathways and just one pedestrian crossing. This is a problem for current Orenco area residents. We will only be placing more people at risk if the city of Hillsboro and the developer do not address these missing pedestrian and bicycle-friendly amenities.

But the "ethical" choice of what to do with the check won out after a moment’s pause.

"That's all we've got to continue to focus on, making sure that we get the end result we want," said Colaiacovo, who assisted on Alex Pietrangelo's goal with 5 minutes, 14 seconds remaining to beat the Oilers.

Perry Fewell helped transform the Giants’ defense last season, turning the league’s 13th-ranked unit in 2009 into the No. 7 defense in 2010 that led the NFL in takeaways. Although Fewell valued his spot with the Giants, he became a desirable head-coaching candidate once the season concluded and it appeared that Giants coach Tom Coughlin might need to find his fourth defensive coordinator in four seasons.

In five games with the Blazers, Hickson is averaging 16.0 points and 5.8 rebounds while shooting 65.5 percent from the field in 26 minutes. This after being buried on the bench in Sacramento, where he averaged 4.7 points in 18.4 minutes. The Kings parted ways with him and Hickson thought he was going to clear waivers and sign a free agent contract with Golden State. But Portland swooped in at the last minute and claimed him, and in 10 short days, he has become the beacon of optimism in an otherwise dismal Blazers season.

A small, laid-back village of just over 100 residents on a secluded bay along Baja's Eastern Cape, Cabo Pulmo remains (literally) off the grid, running on solar power and the occasional generator. It has four restaurants, a general store and three small dive operations that mine the riches of the only living coral reef on the Pacific side of Central America. Whale shark sightings here are not as predictable as at Holbox, and trips to their favored spot (Gordo Banks, a pair of submerged mountains about 6 miles offshore) are limited to experienced divers. Pepe's Dive Center and Cabo Pulmo Divers are especially tuned in to whale sharks.

GAMER YOU'VE GOTTA READ: The Angels are reeling. A closed-door, players-only meeting Thursday started the day, and a walk-off loss to the Tampa Bay Rays ended it. Albert Pujols is struggling (you may have heard) and even when he did get his first base hit of the week he tried to stretch it for a double and was unceremoniously thrown out. Of course, in this game story The Los Angeles Times by Mike DiGiovanna, Pujols' aggressive run is spun as a good thing by a teammate. "That's Angels baseball," he says. He's more right than he knows.

Micheal Ray Richardson’s drug habit was an anvil hanging over the team throughout the 36 months he wore a Nets jersey, but when his mind was unpolluted and his eyes were clear, he was the second-best point guard in the NBA behind Magic Johnson. He helped a Wohl-coached team jump to a 23-14 start in 1985-86 — that would be their best until 2001-02 — before suffering a drug relapse. Within six weeks, he would be expelled from the league for repeated offenses, and, inevitably, the team crashed.

Epicactus always needs to dry a bit between waterings, though it needs more water in spring and summer while it is actively growing than in winter, when it isn't. Mine is outside, under the house overhang, so I can provide winter water only when the potting mix is rather dry. The overhang protects it somewhat from cold, but if frost is predicted, I bring it inside. In summer it gets half-day sun. This is OK since my location is rather foggy, but a couple of hours of sun is enough in brighter locations. Indoors, an orchid cactus wants bright light out of direct sun.

Voter ID laws are just one type of voter suppression tactic being proposed and enacted in states across the country. Others include laws that limit early voting periods, restrict third-party voter registration, eliminate same-day/Election Day voter registration and fail to restore voting rights for millions of Americans with past criminal convictions. Our elected officials should be seeking ways to encourage more Americans to vote, not inventing baseless reasons to deny voters the ability to cast their ballots.

Alas, against Boston's lane-packed defense, his actions did not match his words. This has been a team-wide, playoff-long problem, but James is the leader, so the focus is always on him.
NFL quarterbacks know what Kielbaso means. Avril led NFL defensive linemen with six forced fumbles and two touchdowns last season. He tied for fifth with 11 sacks. But somehow those numbers did not add up to a long-term deal for Avril, who remains at an impasse with the Lions and is not attending their off-season conditioning program. Instead, he drives 45 minutes four days a week to work out with Kielbaso.
As a pulmonologist practicing in Delaware for three decades, I have seen patients suffering from a variety of lung diseases. I’ve seen my patients struggle to breathe and struggle to understand why they could not breathe. I’ve met them in the hospital and in the emergency room, as their struggles to breathe became near impossibility. What I have not seen in all of these years is a decrease in the number of people suffering from lung disease.

I made the mistake of booking a Caribbean cruise during March two years ago. Loud spring breakers running through the halls, sleeping on the lounge chairs so it was impossible to get one and heckling performers during shows did nothing to endear them to me.
"It made it all worthwhile," he said. "Pitching with the bone spur last year and getting the bone spur taken out the beginning of August when I did, it was a hard position to be in: having to contemplate surgery, being shut down for the year, not knowing what the results would be. But being in the situation where I am now, after putting in the hours of hard work, day in and day out, I can't be happier with where I am right now."

Said Andy Schell, another of Rutherford's local sailing friends: "In my mind, he belongs with that Mount Rushmore of sailing pioneers. It's the greatest accomplishment in a sailboat ever.

Purple sea urchins armor themselves with sharp spines, but they're still safe to gently touch -- in fact, they'll give you what feels like a tiny hug if you let your finger linger among the spine tips. Sea urchins move on tube feet, but they're easily caught by faster-moving animals such as sunflower stars and sea otters. The urchin uses its spines, and teeth on its underside, to scrape away a home for itself among rocks.
Linebacker Andrew Sweat and right tackle J.B. Shugarts are two more Buckeyes who could be late-round picks or free agents in a camp.

The GOP-led Legislature did offer those communities a $47.5 million consolation prize -- a pot of money that DFL Gov. Mark Dayton will get to distribute via the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development to capital improvement projects statewide. But that amount of money won't spread very far.
