Chavez's good pal Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is going through some difficulties of his own. The Iranian president, whose own hate-filled speeches have triggered walkouts at the U.N. -- as when he said most people blame Washington for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks -- is gradually losing power. The ayatollahs who helped him retain the presidency after the protests that followed the disputed 2009 election have had enough of Ahmadinejad. He got too big for his britches, and now the turbaned ones want him out. He may or may not stay in office, but he has lost much of his power.

public access to all data about hospitals' quality of care, infection rates and other adverse events also makes sense.

Air travel before 9/11: There was terrorism before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but that day changed the mindset of traveling, particularly abroad. Security necessities have made the trip through airports simultaneously tense and tedious. It's necessary and I've become used to the drill (though not as smoothly as George Clooney's Ryan Bingham character in "Up In the Air").
The new start he will be thinking about soon enough is the start to next season, and the Knicks are trying to figure out how they are ever going to get past the Heat. Of course the Miami Heat isn't ever going to be as good as Michael Jordan's Bulls were in the '90s, but the Knicks have to wonder if they have about as much chance of getting past the Heat as the Knicks of the '90s had of getting past Michael.

Limbaugh's main point in his criticism of McMillan's book was that government shouldn't get involved in the distribution of quality food to urban neighborhoods. ... But Limbaugh's last comment on the matter: "What is it with all these young single white women, overeducated -- doesn't mean intelligent," he said. "Tracie McMillan, the author of this book, seems to be just out of college and already she has been showered with awards ... for social justice journalism."But Politico's Keach Hagey believes the radio host "will no longer command the same kind of fealty from Republicans in Washington" that forced GOP leaders like former party chairman Michael Steele to quickly apologize after criticizing Limbaugh in 2009. "It will now be much more permitted on the conservative side to dissent from Rush," said Michael Medved, a conservative talk radio host who subbed for Limbaugh in the 1990s.

It's through the lyrics that Coons hopes he will have an impact on the listener. "There are so many bands out there. Lyrically is where I think we might stand out, versus most folk-rock-country bands. Lyrically, it's a matter of being really open and vulnerable, not being afraid to let yourself go to places that aren't comfortable. That's difficult. But when I've been able to do that in the past, that's when songs really get the reaction and people really connect. People come up and tell me how much our songs have affected them. That's very powerful and makes me want to do it. I like songs that really go places emotionally. That doesn't always mean being sad. But even when it's happy music, it's going further and really being honest in the songwriting.

I don't know of any law that dictates what specific questions can be asked in an interview. I believe this idea of what questions should and should not be asked comes from the desire to avoid potential problems if a person is not hired. If the interviewer does not ask age-related questions, then the argument they discriminated based on age is harder to make. I believe the law simply states that companies can't discriminate in their hiring based on age. Therefore, it is wise to avoid any appearance of using age as a factor when interviewing.

All drugs are not the same. Different drugs have very different effects on us. Therefore, we need a nuanced policy that reflects these differences. As a general proposition, we should impose greater restrictions on the more dangerous drugs. As simple as that proposition may sound, our current policy is far from it. For example, tobacco and alcohol are responsible for 20 times more deaths than all illegal drugs combined. Yet we impose minimal restrictions on tobacco and alcohol.

Nine other states are considering such legislation, but even the Education Trust, a strongly reform-oriented nonprofit group, has expressed concerns about the trigger as it is currently constructed.

The state is prosecuting improper demonstration in front of a clerk's office, not the status and lifestyle of individuals in the nation.
The committee is backing two bills. The first is a long-overdue requirement that legislators' financial disclosure forms (and later those of other government officials) be posted online. Now they are only available at the state ethics commission's office in Annapolis, and legislators are notified of the identities of those who review the forms, which tends to have a chilling effect on the examination of what are, in fact, public documents. But the second bill reduces the level of disclosure required for local government officials. It comes in response to unsubstantiated fears by local officials and relies on faulty assumptions about the difference between state and local government.

Random urine tests can say a lot about a person, like that she either got the dog to pee into a cup or could one day give birth to a fine litter of Labradoodles. Drug addicts lie. Yours has been lying to you from day one, and not about inconsequential stuff. (Don’t run to get an HIV test; grow wings and fly there.) Your girlfriend’s motto appears to be “Just say ‘Don’t mind if I do!’ to drugs.” You could say she’s been cheating on you with drugs. Actually, she’s been cheating on drugs with you. Make no mistake about what comes first and who comes second. That’s not going to change overnight -- and maybe not ever. You can someday have a loving, mutual relationship -- once you find a partner whose moments of painful honesty involve admitting to stuff like scraping your new car getting into the garage, not “Oh, I had sex with a crackhead I met in rehab. And how was your day?”

A homeowner also may be eligible to receive a credit equal to 30 percent of the cost of alternative energy systems like solar hot-water heaters or geothermal heat pumps.

My third thought was a memory: About 10 years ago, I appeared on WJR's "Paul W. Smith Show." The convivial host and I talked then about what we talk about now: Detroit's problems with crime, finances, corruption and schools.
Next week, I expect to give birth to our second child. The amazing feat, however, is that - barring some unforeseen slip of the tongue - I will have made it through an entire pregnancy without revealing to my husband whether our new baby is a boy or a girl.

Cabezon bills itself as a "restaurant and fish market" -- although you don't really have to fear sitting next to a halibut staring at you from a bed of ice; the fish appears afternoons -- and many of its most striking offerings are indeed maritime. Roasted cod appears in a torrent of textures, the sweet flakiness of the fish set off by crisp Vidalia onion rings and crunchy Tokyo turnips. On another evening-- the menu is somewhat flexible -- the cod is accompanied by a cousin, crisp pieces of brandade, smoked cod mixed with potato.
A state senator joined forces with the Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation on Wednesday to denounce the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and demand the Atlanta school superintendent and school board president resign.

Tucker and co-defendant Mitchell Young, 20, are in the Oakland County Jail, charged with attacking the family with a baseball bat in their Farmington Hills home the morning of April 16. Police have said they believe the men went to the home to steal money for drugs.
That CU-Nebraska game, given the rivalry at the time, was so intense already, and was heightened given the emotion around it. I remember our director Joe Acenti, who just passed away in October, always said it was one of his favorite game broadcasts. The way he cut that show, it was like a movie. It didn't feel like you were calling a football game. It felt like you were a narrator in the background of this incredible Hollywood script that was playing out on the big screen.
A 23-year-old man was wounded in an apparent accidental shooting following a fundraiser Saturday night for a cancer patient at a Wentzville church.
"Let's not go there yet," Shurmur said. "I think they're all getting used to it. I think he catches the ball fine and he's fast-fast. In my opinion, for the most part the guys caught the ball pretty well. I think he's got good hands and he'll show it."

It's one of the better, more informative uses of talking heads you'll see in film.
In Los Angeles and across the country, education officials have long known of the often huge disparities among teachers. They've seen the indelible effects, for good and ill, on children. But rather than analyze and address these disparities, they have opted mostly to ignore them.

"How much of a role should big brother have in your health? Employers are often plan sponsors and laying out a lot of money for this coverage.

Hedgecock also blames Obama for the high unemployment rate for college grads. Hedgecock again misleads by only citing the unemployment rate for grads under 25, while the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, just reported an unemployment rate for college grads 25 and over is 4.2 percent for March 2012. A college education helps to land a job, it just takes time.

The sale of their old home is pending, and the pair has already picked out a new house adjacent to a cemetery.
Even as viewing habits change and some audiences now mostly watch their movies at home, there is much to celebrate about le cinema. Movies end, even obliquely, while television shows are specifically designed to go on and on, giving movies a satisfying narrative compactness and resolution that television can rarely match. The emotional gut-punch of a film such as the recent British thriller "Kill List" gains its power in part because when it's over, that's it, audiences are left reeling to grasp for themselves the death blow of the film's moral sinkhole and sort through their own feelings without the cushion of more to come.
The Ducks are heavy favorites. Oddsmakers have predicted another blowout victory in Autzen, this one by at least 30 points. But UCLA defensive coordinator Joe Tresey thinks Odighizuwa has some physical tools that could cause Oregon problems.

There have been calls for the French media to stop turning a blind eye to the private lives of public figures since the arrest last month of powerful Sarkozy rival Dominique Strauss-Kahn on charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty, that he sexually assaulted a New York hotel maid. A long-rumored history of serial womanizing had previously branded him nothing less than a "living legend" in France, but Puritan soil doesn't wash out so easily.

But don't worry about the numbers. "Here you only need to go by the taste," says Lawrence. The oils are in "fusti," stainless steel jugs with spigots. The oils have a range of flavors — green, floral, fruity, woody, and nutty — produced by the type of olive, how ripe it was when it was harvested, how it was handled and milled. Olive oil is, essentially, the juice of an olive, a stone fruit (there are 700 varieties). "The fresher, the better," she says. Olivette's oils have been milled within three to four hours of harvesting. Sitting around brings out acidity in the olives.
STRONG QUARTER: The country's largest cable company is doing better than most: it's attracting more broadband customers and losing fewer TV subscribers. Results were also strong in the quarter for NBC Universal, the more volatile TV network and movie division.

The games are maybe 20 percent more arcade-y than "FIFA Soccer 12," with a deeper array of tricks and a control scheme that is only as complicated as you want it to be. "FIFA Street" reminded me of my time with "Virtua Fighter 4": It was completely playable if you just want to mash random buttons, with an extremely sharp learning curve if you choose to learn complicated moves.

But if you're prepared to invest the energy - and why not? - avoid the standard holiday card with a cutesy greeting and Santa illustration. Pick a card that may hide a cheeky message or adopt a vintage feel. For those who see a finely designed card as a welcome change from the iPhone or BlackBerry, a handwritten hello can be as special as an expensive gift.

San Anselmo contractor Bill Lehrke called the situation "a very sad and dark day for Marin" since the project represented a "brilliant use of the land" that would provide hundreds of jobs and create a low carbon footprint. "This is the worst example of NIMBYism I have ever witnessed. Instead of this wonderful and thoughtfully designed project, let's develop this space into a few hundred low-income homes," Lehrke said. "And think of the new shopping center that could be built on the St. Vincent property nearby, with big box stores to service their needs."

In the end, our security and leadership does not come solely from the strength of our arms. It derives from our people - from the workers and businesses who will rebuild our economy; from the entrepreneurs and researchers who will pioneer new industries; from the teachers that will educate our children, and the service of those who work in our communities at home; from the diplomats and Peace Corps volunteers who spread hope abroad; and from the men and women in uniform who are part of an unbroken line of sacrifice that has made government of the people, by the people, and for the people a reality on this Earth.
Under Supreme Court precedents, restrictions on free speech by federally licensed broadcasters must be "narrowly tailored to further a substantial governmental interest." In this case, the asserted interest was Congress' desire to preserve educational programming on public stations. In the court's main opinion, Judge Carlos T. Bea concluded that Congress had good reason to worry that the lure of revenue from ads for commercial products might induce public broadcasters to replace educational programming with fare more likely to garner higher ratings. But Bea said there wasn't "substantial evidence in the record before Congress" to suggest that children's and other educational programming would be similarly endangered by a station's acceptance of political ads. (He ridiculed the notion that a station eager for political ads might air a cartoon in which Mitt Romney or Barack Obama fought crime alongside Superman or Batman.)

True, but where is the evidence that 10% or anything close to it is an accurate figure? There isn't any.

The two greatest no-hit pitchers of all-time, Koufax and Nolan Ryan, dominated consecutive decades here.

Nationally, online vacancies rose by 362,100, or 8.41 percent, to 4.67 million, from 4.31 million in March 2011. They rose by 246,300 or 5.57 percent, from 4.42 million in February. Vacancies are 60 percent above their levels in June 2009, the official end of the recession, said June Shelp, vice president of the Conference Board. Still, last month, there were 2.9 unemployed for every vacancy.
A handful of black riot survivors sued the state and city in federal court, but their suits were dismissed because of the statute of limitations.
Still, some dishes are very good, including aoo tikki ($7.95), an appetizer of spiced potato cakes with garbanzo bean gravy. The cakes stay crisp on the outside, even with the gravy poured over the top, and there's a good balance of sweet, spicy and sour that makes the dish addictive. A little spoonful of the cilantro chutney changes the complexity even more, adding the spicy zip of chiles.
Vasek does not expect the district to enter any of the Ohio Auditor's three levels of financial distress (caution, watch or emergency) in the 2011-12 school year, though he concedes that 2012-13 could present a very different situation.

"It just goes to show you that anything can happen," Blackmon said, referring to the Jaguars going after him.
The whole thing worried Deutsch. He didn't like the contract she was offered. More importantly, "Broadway actors got kind of pigeonholed by record companies," he said.
Polls have indicated that the recall election in June should be close, with Walker appearing to hold a slight advantage over a Democratic opponent.
He cited as an example the case of Jose Ruiz, who was convicted of a home-invasion robbery in Newark in February 2001, then disappeared after posting $100,000 bail. The judge denied the prosecutor’s request to revoke bail. "We haven’t seen him since," Laurino said.
For many of us, it doesn't get any better than a brimming bowlful of freshly made, soft-green guacamole, bright with hints of garlic, hot chiles and high notes of fresh lime or lemon.
But the world has changed since the young Obama found his place in it.
I can report exclusively, though, that things along those lines are getting ... weird and strange. The Charlotte newspaper has sent a columnist here to write about Luck in case he does declare himself for the NFL draft and is the No. 1 selection by the Carolina Panthers ... as well as to write about Harbaugh in case the Panthers decide to offer him the head coaching job. Meanwhile, the Detroit Free Press has a person on the scene to shadow Harbaugh in case Michigan coach Rich Rodriguez is fired in the next two days and the school makes a move for the Stanford coach. Plus as we all know, back in the Bay Area, the rumor mill is rife that the 49ers will be coming at Harbaugh with full gale force later this week.
Now, with the green bubble of '08 a mere memory, Obama faces a choice that will enrage a major component of his political base. Kill the Keystone pipeline and he will anger organized labor. Allow it to proceed and the greens will erupt.

The Simmons Firm law office donated $10,000 to the city of Harrisburg (Ill.) Disaster Relief Fund to help rebuilding efforts after an EF-4 tornado struck that city.
Bowman filed James' appeals brief one day after a deadline set by the clerk of the Third Circuit Court. In the court papers he filed yesterday, the lawyer said prosecutors knew their case lacked evidence.

"It is immoral and constitutionally questionable to criminally cite someone for sleeping on the street if no shelter alternative is available.

Aschenbach added that if there had been just a few less inches of flooding during Hurricane Irene, the Municipal Court, which was flooded during the storm, possibly could have been saved. Better stormwater management, members believe, could make that difference.
The GAO referred those two cases and 13 others to the IRS for further investigation.
Right now, the beer industry's talking points in Congress are "really all about jobs," said one industry source.

But at night, the lights are dimmed and a $50 multicourse prix-fixe menu is offered, serving Italian staples such as devil's chicken, and others, such as ricotta gnocchi with goat meat, that allow the chefs to exercise some creativity. All the ingredients are sourced from as close to the restaurant as possible.
One reason my optimism is measured: If former House Whip David E. Bonior is really on the short list for Labor secretary, then that's as close as he should get to the job. His ideas about unionization are frozen in the 1950s, and he's one of the most bullish partisans in modern Democratic politics (I wouldn't be surprised if the House ran out of paper temporarily after Bonior's run of filing ethics charges against then-Speaker Newt Gingrich). Obama would be better off with someone like Andy Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, who understands globalization and isn't going to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement.
He mentions Alex Smith and Sam Bradford. Smith is just now fulfilling promise in his sixth season. Bradford is having a difficult time in a new offense in St. Louis after his team changed offensive coordinators.

The boardwalk still dishes up old-fashioned fun along with corn dogs, cotton candy and deep-fried Twinkies. And promotion, as always, is part of the game. The Seaside Co.'s centennial book, "The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk: A Century by the Sea," recalls crawdad-crawl championships, bodybuilder and beauty contests and a Brussels Sprout Festival featuring deep-fried sprouts, sprout chip cookies and — for sprout haters — a sprout toss.

We’re working on this pop record. It's beginning to take shape. It’s amazing. I’m really excited about the record. It's some of the most catchy, well-written songwriting we've done. We share songwriting duties. It's some of the best stuff we’ve ever done. We both love pop music. Our goal is to write the 10 poppiest songs we could. It's some of his best work to date as well.

Power forms a constant subtext in "Hatshepsut," beginning with the framing question of whether she sought kingship out of personal ambition, a sense of duty to the deities and her culture or those and other possible motives unrecorded or as yet undiscovered. A few other women had apparently held ruling dynastic position before her, possibly in the dire absence of a male heir to the throne, but the archaeological record suggests that Hatshepsut exercised both the ritual and discretionary powers of regency to a greater extent than any female predecessor.

The film's one great distinction is Ashraf Barhom, a fine actor with a worthy, well-written role as a Saudi cop, Colonel Faris Al Ghazi. At first the colonel functions only as the Americans' minder, a dutiful functionary under orders to keep his unwelcome visitors on a short leash. But Al Ghazi defines duty broadly. He feels an obligation to the innocent dead, as well as to the sheiks and shallow princes he must live with. In Mr. Barhom's portrayal, the colonel has depth and a sense of tragedy; he's the sort of worldly-wise survivor who was played in an earlier time by Paul Henreid or Trevor Howard.
