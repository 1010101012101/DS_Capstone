The menu sprawls as awkwardly as the space, veering from one impulse to another. Apply the "keep it simple" principle and you'll be all right. The most interesting-sounding dishes -- such as tuna meatballs with harissa ($8) or banana-chocolate-marshmallow "Camp Fire" pie ($8) -- lack dimension and flavor. A few items, such as the cheeseburger between halves of a glazed doughnut ($7.25), are ill-conceived novelties.
Blanchard sought to investigate the state's attorney's office after reports in the Chicago Sun-Times revealed that the prosecutor's office has been unable to find any paperwork on the 7-year-old case - even though a top prosecutor determined there wasn't enough evidence to warrant filing criminal charges against Vanecko.

And even with the recent gains, the economy isn't anywhere close to replacing the jobs lost in the recession. Employers began shedding workers in February 2008 and cut nearly 8.7 million jobs for the next 25 months. Since then, the economy has regained nearly 2.5 million of those jobs.

"He's got options and he gives us some flexibility and maneuverability with that position," Showalter added. "He's had some experience at high levels, and when you watch how the offseason goes with six-year free-agents, those guys just fly off the board. We were lucky to get Ronny and trade for Taylor and it's an area we've identified. Who knows? He's still a young man. This is not some 28-, 29-year-old journeyman catcher. This is a guy who's been thought very high of recently."

‘Fragments” is both an accurate and deceptive name for the evening of Samuel Beckett pieces being presented by Theatre for a New Audience. These five short works, collectively lasting under an hour, are indeed little more than brief sketches. But like such more expansive plays as “Waiting for Godot,” “Endgame” and “Happy Days,” they capture human existence in all its bleakness and humor.
MH Olivia Rubin, Fieldston
Still, Rub's move reinforces Cleveland's notorious civic inferiority complex, at least momentarily. Among art lovers, it may also create a sense of museum envy.
I suspect that the weakness of this year's CES slate announcements demonstrate one of the reasons behind Apple's decision. A trade show is a phony-baloney date on the calendar and an annual source of pointless stress. If a company - particularly a publicly-traded one - is afraid of sending a bad message by not showing something that's shiny, colorful, and shipping immediately, then they'll feel forced to show off a few chapters of the work-in-progress.

"I don't think so," he said. "Coach Woodson does a great job of figuring out what works for us. My main frustration was that we lost Game 2 and we knew how important it was to win one game on the road. So having Miami up 2-0 is tough for us to deal with because we want to get that win. That was mainly my reason."
The legislation provides $68 million to complete the channel deepening project that will allow bigger ships into the Port of New York and New Jersey. It also includes $1 million for the Passaic River Basin Reevaluation Study. Senators Lautenberg and Menendez and Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-NJ) previously worked to include $1 million for this study in the President’s FY 2013 budget proposal, and today’s approval of the bill is a critical step in securing this funding. In addition, the bill includes funding for other flood mitigation efforts, harbor and river maintenance, and beach replenishment projects across New Jersey.

This olive, wrapped with a bit of anchovy into a microscopically thin membrane of caramel, is the first thing you taste at El Celler de Can Roca, a Catalan restaurant that ranked second in the world on the San Pellegrino World's 50 Best Restaurants list this year. It is a perfect representation of the possibilities of Molecular Gastronomy, or Techno-Emotional cooking, or Modernist Cuisine, where advanced cooking techniques and exotic ingredients are valued as much for their narrative possibilities as for what they might bring to a plate.

Silvia expects the effects to be temporary, with job growth resuming a more moderate pace of about 175,000 a month by June or July. Like many economists, he's not anticipating a more extended swoon, such as dips that occurred the past two years after strong early-year job growth. That growth petered out by spring as employers worried about the European financial crisis and rising gasoline prices.

At this time last year the Indians were the talk of baseball. They were off to an 18-8 start that would soon grow to 30-15.

See, the cruelty-free crowd think their animals love them and can't live without them. That may or may not be true. But there is no doubt that the pet owners can't live without their pigs. Or dogs. Or cats. So they bring them along. They feel it is a higher calling, even when it inconveniences other travelers. And even when it's obvious the pet would be far happier wallowing in mud.

With its dandelions, clover and discarded cigarette butts, the little "bioswale" in front of the Salvation Army community center in West Baltimore won't win any lawn-care prizes. But the shallow, weedy depression collects rainfall washing off an acre of litter-strewn pavement and filters out pollution that otherwise would foul the harbor.
Since sophomore year, he never again lost a high school race. And he has rarely been beaten this year, when, as a 20-year-old, he was deemed too old for high school meets and had to race collegiate runners.

More than half of the $134.7 million in redevelopment would go toward public infrastructure updates in the area, such as improving roads, relocating sewer lines, floodplain mitigation and other upgrades.

An annual vacation also provides a setting for absorbing life's lessons, Roberts said. "I always felt some satisfaction in seeing the kids getting along with one another and working together.

Matusz, the club’s beleaguered 25-year-old left-hander, had lost 12 straight decisions — the longest active skid in the majors — before picking up Tuesday’s win with 61/3 strong innings.

Sailing relatives were part of the impetus for the novel, and though Rogan writes of the ocean with a poet's eye, she also refuses to romanticize the harsh reality. As a storm approached, the water "was bluish-black and rolled past us like an unending herd of whales.

The Legislature must approve Christie's proposed budget as it decides how to come up with the additional funds. But that may not prove to be as difficult a problem as it could have been.

Every single successful tech company in the world (that I'm aware of) started out with eyeballs and clicks and only later became profitable. Yahoo. Google. Amazon. eBay. Salesforce. Baidu.

In other words, out of the Gethsemane of its woe these last few years, this Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce bids fair to emerge as what a chamber of commerce ought to be, and so seldom is. It is very powerful, much more so than the chambers of commerce you are probably accustomed to. It is a sort of government outside the government, bearing about the same relation to the body politic as the Communist party does in Russia. (I suppose I put that in out of pure malice.) And, like the Communist party in Russia, it is most intolerant of all schemes for monkeying with the gears. Radicalism of any kind is anathema to it. I suspect that the big fellows enrolled in it are not anything like so hot on this subject as they are thought to be; but big fellows are not the only ones it must satisfy: the very fact that it has a large membership, has to study the problems of even the littlest fellows, and is the repository of a highly concentrated leadership, has forced it in this matter to go along with the crowd.

3. You'll probably be paying more for airline tickets. That's not a big surprise; although oil prices teased us last fall by dipping to $80 a barrel, they're hovering around $100.

At least, that's the thinking of Joe Brancatelli, whose "Joe Sent Me" newsletter is a travel must-read. "Everyone [the airlines] wants LAX to be a hub," he said. "They can't all be hubbed here." Then too, as business travel continues to recover, the leisure traveler may pay the price.

He also showed some bite on special teams, wiping out freshman Kyle Egan on a kickoff. … one of the highlight catches of the day was by James Rodgers. In warmups. J Rod made a beautiful one-handed snatch over the middle in warmups. … McCants did not look bad, he just didn’t get as many opportunities to carry the ball as some of the kids. … Markus Wheaton got deep several times, and Katz missed him once for a long TD. He had beaten starting corner Jordan Poyer. “Those are killers,’’ said Katz. … freshman placekicker Trevor Romaine was handed Justin Kahut’s job in the spring, but until Thursday we had not seen Romaine kick a field goal in one of the scrimmages.

First are two ideas that aren't bold enough. One thought is to stay the current BCS course but eliminate the limit of teams from one conference and do away with the automatic qualifiers that have kept out higher-ranked teams. The other thought is the original plus-one, selecting two teams after the bowls.
Every few hours, the bus pulled into a rest stop for about 15 minutes "so you can stretch your legs," as one of the drivers put it. And that's exactly what my wife did, striding up, down and around the parking lot like a race walker while I tarried.
"Marshall is a Hall of Fame running back. But if you had lined him up at wide receiver for his career, he would have caught 1,000 passes. He would have been a Hall of Fame wide receiver."
One-On-One Interview With Blazers President Larry Miller -- Ben Golliver, Blazersedge.com: Miller maintained adamantly that the Blazers are not rebuilding and that they have a plan, although he didn't want to reveal details, noting that plans can "shift from day to day."

But with 35 special events annually and the number of permit requests growing each year, the strain on the city is growing, Burt said.
The benign bombing is part of a larger phenomenon known as activist gardening that is taking off this spring in cities such as Portland, Detroit, Baltimore and Washington, where young urbanites are redefining the seemingly fusty pastime as a tool for social change. This is civil disobedience with a twist: Vegetable patches and sunflower gardens planted on decrepit medians and in derelict lots in an effort to beautify inner-city eyesores or grow healthful food in neighborhoods with limited access to fresh food.

What's there: Hertfordshire's gargantuan mansions are open for the public to gawk at (for a fee, of course). There is plenty to do in Hertfordshire for free, such as visiting the 26-mile-long Lee Valley Regional Park, which runs along the River Lee through the Olympic Park and into the River Thames.

One aspect that welfare reform supporters seem to be overlooking is the cost of starting new programs. Paying to test welfare recipients for drugs, then sending them to state-funded substance abuse treatment centers, as Sacia proposed, would cost taxpayers.

While voters may not object to his success and his resulting wealth, the perception that he is "not in touch with the struggles of ordinary Americans" will be used against him, the pollster said. (To blunt such assertions, Romney has already launched his own line of attack accusing Obama of being out of touch — a member of what he described as the "extraordinary elite.")

There's also greater disparity in the quality of the acts than you typically find in a Cirque show.

Given that the show runs nearly three hours long, including a half-hour intermission, losing a few of the uninspired routines would be some welcomed belt-tightening.

It has to help the employer's bottom line to cut these corners, and certainly the times demand that employers cut as many corners as they can.

I worked for the federal government for 37 years — almost 30 years in financial management in the Social Security Administration. Because of my long absence from government service and because of concerns that have arisen about the future solvency of the insurance program, I recently read the 2011 annual report issued in April 2011. Future projections contained in that report are that the Social Security funds will cover payment of full benefits up to 2036 and pay about three-fourths of benefit amounts through 2085. (With the continuing unemployment levels this year, the 2012 report will probably revise downward those projections.) The 2011 report strongly recommends that the earlier Congress enacts changes to the program that will improve the trust fund balances over the long run, the better.

Kibbey was an especially dynamic presence, not just in her playing -- she took a virtuoso turn with the quartet in Debussy's "Danses sacrée et profane," a performance marked by crisp phrasing and driving energy -- but also in her remarks to the audience. The format of these concerts involves musicians' comments from the stage in lieu of program notes, and there's generally a certain level of endearing awkwardness involved, but Kibbey took to the microphone like a seasoned pro after Debussy's Sonata for Flute, Viola and Harp, briefly explaining with clarity and confidence the significance of the piece (it was the first major work for those forces) and relating the music to Debussy's life (he was dying of cancer when he wrote it, and the first movement hints at the narcotic fog he was experiencing).

His answer surprised me at the time, but he was right: On a scale of 1 to 10, the Cuban missile crisis of 1962 was an 8, he said; 9/11 was a 3. Those who lost their lives and their loved ones suffered mightily, and, as with any disaster, the psychological effect was magnified by the number of people who were killed at the same time. But for the nation, it was a blow, not a mortal threat.

Underscoring it all was the absurdity, endemic in today's television, of asking viewers to care deeply about the minor travails of the very rich and semi-famous.

The reality is that the border is more secure and less porous than it has been in decades.
