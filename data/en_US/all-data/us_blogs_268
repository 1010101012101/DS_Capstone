Beginning my collection of watery Sundays in 2011 - an afternoon with our two boys, before they headed back South to university and their city lives. This one last Sunday together in mid January marked the final end of the festive season for us!
For entry level positions in the field of chemical engineering, candidates need to equip themselves with a bachelor's degree in engineering. Engineering degrees can be obtained in electrical, mechanical, electronics or civil engineering. Engineers trained in one branch can have the flexibility of joining other related branches of engineering. This flexibility benefits employers as well as engineers. While employers can easily meet their staffing needs, engineers can have multiple career opportunities to choose from and can also shift fields depending on the prospects and interests. Besides the engineering degrees mentioned above, many colleges also offer specialized courses or training programs in engineering technology, the duration ranging between 2 to 4 years.

Racism is mentioning the fact that ethnic minorities commit a disproportionate number of crimes without insisting that crimes, such as gang rape, honour killings and shooting someone because they disrespect you, are the fault of social deprivation and racist white society.

Cameroon has has the same president, Paul Biya, for 30 years. He is seeking re-election for another seven. This is typical of many African countries. The "president" is basically in power until he dies. But countries like, Egypt, Tunisia, and Libya have fought hard recently to change this.
My method for this recipe was to increase the zucchini, onion and eggs and add corn (some chopped up red pepper would be a nice addition). I added a little more flour because the zucchini has a tendency to seep and the batter becomes thin. There is no added butter or oil except what is used in the pan to cook them making them a bit more healthy. I also scraped the corn cob with the dull side of a knife to "juice" it for that delicious corn nectar that lives there. The first batch was a total success (a rare occurrence to be happy the first time!) and disappeared quick. That can happen when there is a hungry son lurking around.

Last note: I moved this up on my TBR pile for a couple of reasons. One, I was looking for more books with covers of people of color, and Alex, who is Mexican, is featured on the cover. Elkeles is not Latino, but from the endnotes she reveals that she carefully researched Alex's world to make it as realistic as possible. Two, I heard Elkeles speak at ALA, and she is TERRIFIC. And funny. And caring. And really, truly believes in teen literacy and in writing books for boys and girls. Seriously -- while, yes, this book IS a Romeo & Juliet romance (and a great romance!), it is also a story full of action. Yes, teenage boys will like it. Also, she has a great website for Perfect Chemistry with a video, and playlists!
According to my colleague the lady was particularly angry at us! She believed that as the products appeared similar we must be the same company. My colleague tried reasoning with the caller, telling her that it may well have been the case that our company had purchased the item in question from the same wholesaler, but to no avail the customer would just not have it and demanded to speak to a manager.

The book details much of the history and nature of Victoria in Australia, including I was pleasantly surprised the Eureka Stockade, the scene of a heroic rebellion in 1854 from which we get the Eureka banner, similar to Irish banners, based on star constellations.

Aqil: It wasn’t so much that people didn’t get us, it was that people were a bit jealous of what they perceived us to have. Plus we weren’t trying to fit in. That was rules of Hip Hop man! Our LP came out just before ATLiens (Outkast) Of course their production values etc were far better, but people got them. So it was just a natural anti UK bias towards our own that was very prevalent at that time too.

You see, the trouble with Dave is that he is such an economic, social and geopolitical lightweight, if we didn’t nail his feet to the ground he would simply float away. As I have posted in the past, Cameron’s idiotic words in Ankara will come to haunt him as the years pass. But above all, they display clearly that he is just another braindead New Paradigm mercantile globalist: nothing wrong with the system, no alternative, everyone’s a winner, roll up yer sleeves, jolly good show, silly Socialists and tooth-suckers blah blah blah blah blah oh look, I’m halfway to Mars how did that happen?

The last time Iran was in a war, it was with Saddam Hussein’s Iraq from 1980 to 1988 and it turned out very badly for them. They lost over a million men and it was fought to a stalemate. That memory is still very much alive in the minds of Iranians.

One hundred. Glinda set the brush down and opened her eyes. The sun was setting, and the breezes on the high tower were beginning to chill, drawing up the goose flesh on her exposed legs, hardening her exposed nipples. If only they could see her now, she thought - still tall and strong and young, thighs still white, still tight, her breasts ample and perky, the curve of her bottom still rounded in a way that begged worship. And worship it had gotten, worship at the hands - or paws - of the one creature that the power, the strength, the virility to stand up to her. The Lion. She sighed, felt the sudden rush, the flush, the blush that she both loved and hated, waited, breath bated, for the way that he mated with her, his soft fur, warm purr, so able to spur her on to new heights, or new depths, depending on how one looked at it. It was disgusting. It was sickening. It was deliciously deviant and decidedly delightful. It was dangerous. It was deadly. It was dark. It was the best fuck she'd ever had time and time again.

I've got to hand it to Breckenridge Brewing Company. They've created something truly special with their summer campaign for "truth in beervertising". Most craft breweries don't have large advertising budgets. Most of their marketing dollars are spent getting their beer onto the shelves, not onto your televisions and newspapers. But Breckenridge saw the value in pushing their name out to the masses, and did so in a brilliant way.

The testimony has proven both painful and poignant, especially that of a 48-year-old man who said he had been in love with his parish priest during a five-year sexual relationship that began in ninth grade – and jealous when the priest allegedly bedded down at his farmhouse with other teens.
Overall this was a great break and an excellent product.

Every SLR allows to use the B (bulb) pose that allows very long times (seconds, minutes, hours), the B pose is useful in those photographic genres as the night photography. When you set the B pose the shutter is opened by pressing the shutter button and is closed when is the button is released, it exist also the T pose that works in a similar way, by pressing the shutter release the exposure starts and pressing it again it ends, in both cases you risk to move the camera, that's why it's better to use the remote control or the self-timer.

I was so thrilled with my discovery, i forced myself to keep about a glass in the fridge for Ro, who came back from work, spiked it with gin and said it was much better...Hmmmpfff...so much for all the hard work!

Back in the days of Gutenberg & Caxton printers & publishers were the technological innovators. In the twenty-first century the technological innovators are not publishers. They are venture-capital backed organisations working on totally different risk/reward cycle to the traditional publishing industry – be they the giants like Amazon, or student start-ups that go on to change the ways in which people communicate across the globe.

The U.S. is scheduled to withdraw 23,000 U.S. troops by the end of the summer, following the reduction of 10,000 troops at the end of last year, leaving roughly 68,000 troops in Afghanistan this fall.
I have written elsewhere of the “tyranny of improvisation” and the inherent risks of addressing political crises through extra-constitutional measures: in West Africa, those who take power by force vowing to organize democratic elections have a poor track record of delivering on their promises. Moreover, Mali’s March 22 coup continues a terrible precedent, reinforcing the notion that in desperate times, individuals can use the power of the gun to press the state’s “reset button,” dissolving the institutions of government rather than working through them to effect needed changes. Such an improvisational course is always dangerous, since leaders who lack effective institutional oversight are prone to every type of undemocratic and abusive behavior.

That’s Mr. Lee… very jovial and genial, except… I’d rather not spend more time with him than I have to. Mr. Lee met me in 춘천 (Chun-cheon) which is where he lives. I am not sure why he took me, maybe it was more convenient or they trusted me not to get lost on the bus… I dunno. K.’s school took him directly to his immigration office. Anyway, I get there and we go to the immigration office to learn that I needed some more documents – specifically, my 호적 (ho-juk, family register) to confim that I fulfilled the requirements for getting an F-4. Which I also had to do in New York… when I first got the visa. I still don’t know why they need it twice. Having the F-4 visa should be confirmation of these required documents, because you needed them to apply for it. =_= Anyway, maybe this is why they needed to check: according to the 춘천 immigration office (and, according to the agent I spoke with, all immigration offices within the ROK) I should not have gotten the F-4 visa.

The first shade from the collection I'm sharing is OPI Barre My Soul, a peach toned beige jelly/sorbet built off a white base. Depending on your skin tone it can look more white or more peach. I think my pale skin tone makes it look more white but not too white. OPI Barre My Soul is not a runny jelly, nor is it thick. The formula is just right and makes application easy. I used three coats to achieve a clean well groomed look.
The economist and academic Lord Stern, appointed by the government in 2005 to investigate the economics of climate change, tried to put exact figures on this. His 2006 report has become the standard document justifying action on global warming, which Stern calls the greatest market failure in history. Personally, I think the Stern report may turn out to have been a disaster. This is because Stern is an economist and economists obfuscate matters. He recommended allocating 1% of the world economy to fighting climate change and to prevent what he said would be a 20% drop in the world economy due to warming.

Corked, decanted, as a sipper, tobacco, smoky-figgy, dark ruby colour, lush and fruity. Quite different with dinner (pork loin chop broiled with olives, capers, lemon juice/zest, garlic, chicken stock) and roasted celeriac. With food it became more typically Cab Sauv, peppery, not quite as smooth, some vanilla and tannins on the finish. It didn’t taste new world to us and it shows yet again that whatever is going on down Argentine-way is working like a charm. Great label to boot.

Intramurals today are the Teachers vs the Trojan Tropics
Today my son was disappointed about something and began to cry giant crocodile tears. He was pitiful. In those moments, there is not much comfort I can provide other than a big hug. After the ordeal was over, I started analyzing the situation and it struck me that these moments are not going to last much longer. You see, my children are not always going to want to come running to Mommy for a shoulder to cry on or to get comfort from a hug. Particularly my son, I fear. So while I certainly don't wish heartache and despair upon my children, I do embrace those few and fleeting moments in time that they do turn to me. One day, God willing, they will be grown-ups. Unfortunately this also means their heartaches will be bigger. While I pray that they will turn to me or their Dad for a comforting shoulder or a hug, I also understand that this will most likely not always be the case. My true prayer is that they will always know that we will be there for them, and that God will always be there for them as well. While I can provide temporary comfort, God is their ultimate comforter.
Three major events got the ball rolling. On March 19, 1948, Wertham sponsored a symposium under the ongoing professional umbrella of the Association for the Advancement of Psychotherapy. Four top professionals presented and read papers with the introduction by Dr. Frederic Wertham himself, "The Psychopathology of Comic Books". Wertham immediately would expound on his ideas in the March 27,1948 issue of Collier's Weekly and the March 29, 1948 issue of The Saturday Review of Literature, both to be covered below.
As it turned out, Moscow wanted me back, and made the first overture. In my twenties, instead of becoming some adventurous, polyglot expatriate, as I’d envisioned, I became a pilot and flight instructor back home in Nashville. Which is why, in 2002, I found myself at a conference of women aviators, where I happened to meet a couple of boisterous Russian women, one of whom was a world aerobatics champion, and the other, a WWII veteran bombardier named Galina.
Here’s a shot of my splits. Technically Nike+ said I only ran 2.99 miles (when I transferred it to Daily Mile it said 2.99887 or some number like that… REALLY Nike+??), so my last split would be around 9:44. Today my legs feel fantastic and am not sore at all. This really makes me think I can do this speed increase thing! I looking forward to try my shoes on a longer run. Hopefully I can fit that in Wednesday or Friday.

The questions were basically a short version of the entire exam, so instead of a 40 mark question it was a 10 mark question. We had an hour, and I wrote just over 3 1/2 pages :D I had loads to say for some of the questions :) I ran out of steam a little towards the end, but I think I have probably done quite well :) Of course I have, it’s only Media :D If I don’t get an A in media, I will either be very surprised, or know it was because I was over confident and didn’t do enough revision. I’m just gunna have to make sure this second option doesn’t happen :) Collywood next Tuesday, and Holly seems to be looking forward to it :) She’s voted for us, and is going to get a load of other people to vote for us as well :) Both Jared and Luke have their tickets now as well, and Jared’s got one for Zoe too :) It’s gunna be a good night I reckon, and it will be even better if we win something :) But overall I’ve had a very examy day (yeah it’s a word ;D).

The food table included a white lego man border that was the backing for another project that I will show you tomorrow. I just taped them in line to the table cover. I also took some DUPLO lego blocks (the larger ones) and holders for the silverware and napkins.

For those of us who live for the neutral and the black; the kaftan is our celebration of the colour spectrum.

The downside:
Sandoval then invited another dynamic young LA musician, saxophonist Zane Musa, to the stage. Musa unwrapped his soprano and what followed was a whirlwind rendition of “Cherokee.” Watching Musa’s fingers flying over the soprano’s keys was a wonderment, and he did it with complete tonal control over the sometimes challenging instrument. Sandoval, meanwhile, took advantage of the old be-bop favorite to rip off some of the cadenzas the audience had been waiting for.

For my first seam, I do not use pins, but you certainly could. The seam binding is a bit sheer and very delicate, so you should be able to see/feel where the edge of your material is. I like to place the binding so a bit more than half of the binding hangs over the edge (if your fabric if thick, you may want to have even more hang over the edge to accommodate the thickness). Stitch this is place and continue unwinding from the spool at your feet until you reach the end of the fabric.

We approached store number one, a big box electronics chain that had prices so low they were practically giving it away (okay, not really). We opted for parking in the home improvement store’s lot across the street when we saw the packed lot and line of several hundred people twisting around the end of the building. “I’ll get in line, you go up front to see if you need a voucher for the camcorder,” she directed firmly. I moved forward into a combination of lights from the parking lot and TV trucks – coverage you can count on at the front. Oh, the humanity!
Leonard’s story is representative of what was described as de facto segregation in the New York City school system, in which many of the schools were essentially all white or all black because of the neighborhood in which they were located, and the quality of the education was not equal among the schools.
While City were unchanged from their 2-0 win over Wolves, Ferguson made four changes from his sides 4-4 draw win Everton. Wayne Rooney was the lone man up front, Ryan Giggs was used in a narrow left-sided position, and Park Ji-Sung was used at the front of the central midfield three and given the job of tracking Yaya Toure’s forward bursts. Chris Smalling replaced the ill Jonny Evans and Phil Jones played ahead of Rafael, who was dropped. His selections were designed to match City in the middle but in doing so sacrificed his sides width.
It does that.

Baba Yaga is RIGHT. If we have our homes infested with pests, we eliminate them. We cull other species because they ‘over-populate’ and ‘manage’ ancient forests by chopping them down.
Typical of our federal government: we have 49 separate federal jobs training programs. And the GAO had determined that only five of them have had an impact, and that impact has been "small, inconclusive, or restricted to short-term impacts." But politicians just love funding such programs so they can pretend they're doing something about unemployment.

Let me tell you about my week. I did okay on Wednesday and Thursday. Then came Friday, Saturday and Sunday and the Valadez family reunion. I am not a Valadez by blood, but you couldn't ask to be lucky enough to be welcomed into this family as an outsider. This is the family of one of my cery best friends. If you read my True Confession yesterday, you know what went on at this reunion. If not, go ahead and read it...I'll wait. So you see why I was surprised when I got on the scale today. I was sure I was going to have a big gain.

People handle conflict differently. Some people compete with others, which is often aggressive in nature. Others accommodate, where a person defers to another, and others avoid it (I see this a lot in my practice as a style of resolving conflict), hoping that if it isn’t discussed then it will somehow miraculously disappear. Another style is to compromise–having a “give and take” attitude along with tradeoffs. Finally, there are those who prefer to collaborate with others, being motivated by a desire to solve problems and create a win/win resolution. This style, along with learning how to compromise, is a more effective conflict resolution style compared to the others. Further, having a compromising or collaborative style often results in a greater propensity to effectively communicate and assert personal needs in a positive way.
So it all sounds great in theory right... The curse is that it's 5 and a half hours from where I currently live.

On last week’s edition of Real Time, Bill Maher argued during the panel discussion that Mitt Romney should be giving money to an actual charity rather than just the standard tithe to the Mormon church. Maher’s comments were immediately picked up by the conservative blogosphere, and in his final New Rule tonight, Maher defended what he said by arguing that while the Mormon church does good works, unlike most charities, it is not their main focus.

Finally after watching the little GPS map from our cabin, we were about to fly over Haiti and enter the Dominican Republic. We flew right over ground zero and the area we were to stay in. From the sky, I could see all of the tent cities, rubble, the remarkable country side, and even some “tiny” vehicles driving across the terrain. I to this day cannot (in words) express the feelings that were rushing through my body at what I saw. After just a couple of minuets of flying across these two countries, we finally landed in the Dominican Airport.

I recently wrote a fantastical post about playsuits. The best part of the post was going to be moi in a playsuit circa 1998. But I couldn’t find the photo. My mother diligently helped me go through boxes and boxes of photographs trying to find the one of me posing like John Travolta in a blue pinstripe playsuit wearing my infamous roller skates. We never did find that photo…so I never ended up publishing that post. Shame, I really liked it.

He was always willing to help those in need, Be them mutant or human. I wont to be that to all of you. Not only your leader but your friend. I want you to feel comfortable coming to me, no mater what your concerns may be. I can only hope I do my father’s memory proud, that I do all of you proud. Helix has always been important to me, every member like family.

Two: If you inherited a property and are not sure about the market or who the most likely buyer for that area/town would be, consult with your Realtor. Have them recommend a professional stager. Birgit Anich of ” Birgit Anich Staging & Interioirs” ” in CT told me that stagers not only advise you on what repairs/updates need to be done but also study the demographics and psychographics of the area to determine who the most likely buyer will be. A study by the Real Estate Staging Association showed that staged homes on average sell 67% faster. The Real-Estate Guru Barbara Corcoran mentioned, in an interview with the Nate Berkus Show, that staged homes can bring in a 5 to 10% higher selling price.
The whole book was kind of one big epic battle for Avalon. Seriously it was pretty much action from the first page to the last. This was fine and it kept the plot moving at a good clip. The problem with it was that in Laurel's own words...she's not really a fighter. As a result Laurel spends a lot of time hanging back and watching David and Tam kill stuff. This story ends up being less about Laurel and more about everyone else who is actively fighting in the battle to save Avalon.

That kind of conversion is possible with slick marketing, but I think it will be more rewarding if I can do it by reaching out to people, and responding when they reach out to me.

Most of the time ex’s were in denial, They keep telling themselves that they never long for their ex, but you know for a fact that you are still in love with your ex and you want to win him back. I will let you decide on this matter. The answer will largely depend on you, if you are separated for reasons of money, lack of time and attention, it surely can be work out. Hence, if you separated due to cheating, I suggest do not try it again. The possibility that your partner will cheat is more likely to happen.

"It's the others" he replied, looking over his shoulder. "It's dog eat dog in this business. We get €24 for every kilometer we clear.

I had to use glue, yes I glued The Holy Family to the jar, because Joseph kept slipping to the back. While I was waiting for the glue to set I thought of how this was much like his life, he was happy with being Mary's helpmate. He was there to help her deliver and care for the Son of God, never reaching for the spot light himself.

In the Bible, Psalm 51, we find that King David composed a song, a prayer of repentance unto the Lord after He was convicted in his heart that He did evil before the Lord.

I've got a whole slew of theater majors (they seem to clump together and register for their gen ed courses in bunches), and I always enjoy the theater kids; they are not always the best students, but they're quirky and passionate and interesting, and they tend to genuinely like being in college, unlike the business / pre-nursing / occupational therapy / culinary arts crowd, who are usually just in it for the piece of paper. (I feel a little guilty about stereotyping students based on majors, and there are always ones who defy the stereotypes, but on the whole they hold true.)

You’ll look hard to find China’s ancient majesty. It’s tucked away, almost an amusement park. Beijing has cool new buildings (the Olympics’ Bird’s Nest and Water Cube; CCTV “Big Underpants”) but what most characterizes Beijing is…miles and miles of already-cracking nondescript newness. Ugly flyovers across 8-lane mid-city highways. It seems contradictory yet Beijing is overpopulated yet barren. Beijing, despite China’s amazing excitement and energy, the humor and art, vitality, great food, is largely depressing if you love cities. Just try to find a pedestrian route through this seemingly improvised sprawl.

Worm tea is made from fully decomposed compost. The simplest form is to add water to a small amount of fully decomposed compost and letting it steep for 30 minutes or so and then using the liquid to fertilize plants. I haven’t found many recipes for tea online so I don’t have an exact ratio but I also don’t think it can be too harmful if the ratio isn’t exact as it’s compost diluted with water. Basically, you’re adding a lot of the beneficial properties of the compost without adding the bulk. You can even add the remaining compost bits back in the bin or into a planter if you wish.

Honestly, I'm a little surprised. Total Wine has come by Good Burp and read some of the posts before. They have even left a comment from time to time.

Prague so far has been very cold, the highest temperature has been -4 degrees, so wrapping up every time I’ve stepped out of the flat, cafe or pub has been paramount. 2 pairs of socks are a must after having been out on the first evening for a quick recce in just one pair!

First, the 1,000 have already returned to you. But, it doesn’t came back entirely in the form of money. The remaining 300 might already came in another form, for example a reputation, fame, trust from your co-workers and boss, or a chance to get even more profit!

After all, it had been eight years.

This is the critique of capitalism that I hold: It is not just that capitalism is unfair or exploitative, and therefore we should go back to some pre-capitalist social formation: it is just that the contradictions in the capitalist production will lead to depletion of resources, an inability to steady-state in growth, and to massive impoverishments of the majority that it had enriched prior as their are no new markets for which capitalism to expand. Globalism delivers the promise of markets to relative enrichment of prior social formations, but generally through the accumulation of resources into the hands of a few and thus leading to extractive economies. Even conservatives are beginning to see this trend.

Saturday, after breakfast at the hotel, we headed off to the Louisville Zoo for a couple of hours. The kids had a great time. Every animal we saw, Noah would greet with "Hi, (animal name)." and "Bye, (animal name)." Very cute! Unfortunately, Elias and Ceili Fey did nothing but fight over who got to push Henry in the stroller. For awhile, Noah pushed him while they were distracted by their fighting. Oddly enough, Noah did a better job of pushing the stroller than the other two combined.

Eleri has been complaining on and off for a few weeks that her ear hurts. I've been giving her Calpol, and then she's been getting better. But, when she started complaining again this week, I decided it was time to take her to the doctor to get it checked out. And, apparently, she has a foreign body in her ear! I am so shocked as she has never been a child prone to putting things in her mouth or up her nose or anywhere else. Eleri says she can't remember putting anything in, but she is adamant that no-one else has put something in her ear. So we have no idea what it is or how long it's been there!!!

Tim Murray, co-breeder of Organisedconfusion, was Arthur Moore’s first owner when he started training. Alan and Grace Dunlop, from Balloo, near Killinchy in Co Down, Northern Ireland, were the second. Their first prestige winner was the Moore- trained Yankee’s Princess in the 1983 Irish Lincoln and the mare went on to breed the high-class chaser Delphi Lodge, whose seven wins (in partnership with Mark Ferran) for Tom Taaffe included the 1998 Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse. The Dunlops currently have two horses in training, Organisedconfusion (whom they acquired over dinner and drinks on holiday in Tenerife with the Moores) and Back To Balloo, with their local trainer Colm McBratney and runner-up in a novice hurdle at Fairyhouse on Sunday. Dunlop’s business is agricultural machinery.

Originally trains used the High Level Bridge to reach Newcastle Central Station and had to leave the station in the same direction they had entered, which involved the tedious task of reversing. The construction of the King Edward VII Bridge provided four more rail tracks, and a direct line through the station enabling trains to enter or leave from either side and thus eased rail congestion.

Did you think creamy cole slaw has mayonnaise in it? That's okay. It’s what I thought until I was 29 and visiting my friend in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. We made cole slaw and I learned that the good stuff - that creamy, luscious kind that reminds me of the little container that would come with my Kentucky Fried dinner as a kid - is actually creamy.

While I'm not giving up entirely on the new (I still get a kick out of opening packs and I want to collect Heritage 2012) I talked about my shift to vintage after going hog wild on new in 2011.

Because of all the parasites in the water back then it was safer to squeeze grapes for drinks but that is called 'new wine' and do you know what new wine is? Grape juice.
The higher tax argument implies that politicians know how to spend money better than we do; that they have some kind of moral authority to determine which causes are worthy, and which are not, and that their determinations supersede our own.

. . . Thursday Sara and I got going a bit sluggishly, but finally made it out the door and headed to Fisherman’s Wharf to meet Holly. Unfortunately, we got a bit lost. We needed to get off in downtown and change from the subway to a trolley, but thought we changed at the end of the line. So we backtracked back to downtown to wait for the trolley. It was almost 1 pm already and poor Holly had been waiting a while. So we went against my penny-pinching nature and took a cab to Fisherman’s Wharf.
The opening chapter to The People of the Sea sees Thomson, now a grown man, recalling that time with obvious fondness. It is also worth noting that his last memoir, published in 1987, a year before his death, was Nairn In Darkness And Light which won the NCR Book Award for Non-Fiction in 1988. The place must have had some effect on him for him to be drawn back to its memory over sixty years later but that’s not the book that he’ll be remembered for. His legacy will undoubtedly be The People of the Sea which, although autobiographical in tone, has Thomson taking on the role of folklorist recording for future generations some of the many tales told around the fireside of an evening and also, in passing, presenting a snapshot of a way of living that has all but died out.
I also made a quilt block for a community quilt. The color scheme requested was yellow, gray and aqua/turquoise. I really like this color combo...I could have kept going! This one was made and mailed in the same day. New record!

Then there’s all those etiquette issues I’ve completely forgotten about. Putting your hand up before talking, arriving anywhere on time, having to bluff your way through an answer when asked a question about something you were meant to have read but haven’t. And you have to remember to not roll your eyes when people gush about their plans for world domination and the earth-shattering moment when they knew they had found their calling.

I am disappointed by the removal of the equipment and some of the skills because they weren’t replaced with anything. It feels lazy that the new skills are all combat focused. Most puzzles revolve around the wizards levitation but the thief out of anyone could have a new puzzle related ability.
Now, the truth is, there are a ton of people out there who phone query. We get at least several calls a day where someone calls for information on how to query, how to get an agent, how to get published, or worse how can they prove they're better than the average slush pile.
In this way the love of God was revealed to us:
Because of that exquisite detachment of reality, that through a canvas and at times, we need to let flow, it is that imagination allows itself to unfold, under the shape of beautiful images to which we add an emotional meaning that we seek to share with the rest of the beings around us, who also have and enjoy the ability to imagine.

One would expect to see in Christian Endeavor literature countless accounts, examples, and discussions of decisions for, acceptance of, or surrenders to, Christ, and the resultant born again standing as sons of God. But that is not the case. Why?
So when Peter commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ who were we to go against the great apostle? We simply took the Bible literally. Peter was with Jesus. Peter was with him for forty days after the Lord resurrected. So surely he knew more than we. He understood. He was even told by Jesus that flesh and blood did not reveal to Peter who Jesus was, but the Father in heaven.

As a result of these events, the Sikh rebellion and militant movement gained a lot of support and momentum. In order to crack down on the insurgency that ensued, counter laws were enacted and the police were given any means necessary to kill the rebellion. The end appeared to justify any and all means, including torture and murder (Kaur, 2002). The decade long crackdown of insurgency after 1984 lead to the death of at least 10,000 people, while some estimates range as high as 200,000 (Kaur, 2002).
In the early months of 1924, Howard Carter had opened the gilded shrines that surrounded Tutankhamun’s mummy and removed the lid from the huge stone sarcophagus. However, the tomb had then been shut again for almost a year while Carter and the Egyptian government battled over ownership of the tomb and artifacts.

Painting Arman was both fun and challenging. I hadn’t painted a dog before, so it was difficult to try and get the colours right. In the end, I settled on the colours of bullmastiffs for Arman’s fur, specifically this big fella.
We all come in and out of “stormy” times in our lives. Thankfully, I personally happen to be in a peaceful time of calm at the moment; but having spent almost 15 years in Kansas, I have learned that “weather patterns” can change suddenly. One must always have an “ear” to the “Weatherman”, Jesus, and be watching and prepared …listening much Him so one can “know” what to do when particular “storms” come. As we are faithful to “take cover” under the shadow of His Wings, we can be assured that regardless of what comes our way…His promises of protection and provision are ours for the asking. Stay close to Him, for He is our “shelter”!

I was sitting at the table after a nice dinner of Dreamfield pasta, turkey meat balls and an Italian sausage. I was completely satisfied from the food I had just eaten and doing perfectly on my calorie count for the day. I had even taken a 10 minute walk early in the afternoon with my son. But as the storm of aggravation hit I found myself thinking about and starting to plan what I could eat after everyone had gone to bed. I was thinking about making a few peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with a tall glass of milk and a few other of my former late night standard meals (not snacks). That's right... thinking about this minutes after I had finished eating dinner.
From the perspective of all supporters of the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and Bill of Rights of these United States, and true supporters of states’ rights and limited republican government, we are all operating deep behind “enemy lines.” These United States of America are under attack by a statist philosophy of centralized government intent upon destroying our sacred birthright of freedom, and replacing it with a dark globalized Marxist regime that recognizes neither freedom nor our God-given rights.
Even if the chief captain understood the message of Paul to that crowd of Jews, he still would not have understood. It would have made no sense to him unless he had spiritual discernment; unless he had an understanding of Israel’s demise. By demise I mean Israel’s failure to obey the ministry of Jesus Christ and the subsequent ministry of the Holy Spirit following Pentecost.

All new illustrators should show a complete range of work in their initial portfolio; it is important to demonstrate that you can illustrate animals, people, buildings and landscapes equally convincingly. A publisher will need to rely upon you to go where the text takes you, even if your particular speciality is one of these things. It’s important to bear in mind that most books are still printed using the 4-colour print process, as well, so your particular technique needs take into account that certain textures and colours won’t reproduce, or will flatten, during repro. It’s generally a good idea to use as broad a colour palette as possible when working for younger children.

My personal trainer, Grant, told me off yesterday for even thinking about jogging with a swollen knee. I know he’s right, but it still sounds odd to me that I’m training for a marathon and I’m not allowed to run! There’s no point in having a personal trainer unless you trust their advice, so for now I have to work on losing weight and improving my general fitness without breaking my knees.

I went the clean and simple route with this card, but I would like to try the sketch again and take it up a notch. Isn't versatility great? Barry is colored with Prisma pencils and accented with glitter. I wanted to let the DP shine, so I used just some simple beads for the sentiment. Was thinking of adding some snowflakes, but I made myself stop...after all, the snowflakes on the DP are so pretty.

It's 1860 in Virginia, and Evvy Chamberlyn is expected to behave in a certain way. She, however, has no intentions of living up to those expectations about how to "dress, speak, and act the part of the proper Southern belle." I'm not sure what I expect from this small paperback book, but it called to me when I saw it at my library and I checked it out.

So, what kept us so busy.... we put in a new surround for the tub, patched a couple holes in the walls, packed more stuff, and Travis and the boys hauled it all out to the shed for now. Cleaned up the deck and the yard, scrubbed walls, rearranged our room, made BIG messes everywhere, (renos suck at times) and shopping.... I think we had to hit every hardware and paint store in town to get all the supplies we needed. That was a painful experience. Thankfully I had already decided on an off white for the bathroom and mudroom, and that was an easy pick. I'm not going to fiddle with testing a few different colors, I picked one, and that's what it's going to be! A little crazy, but I figured there isn't too much room for error with a white.

We’ll see. Never can tell for sure with kids.
This play is an early tragedy (and likely Shakespeare’s first) about two teenage “star-cross’d lovers” whose “untimely deaths” ultimately unite their feuding households. The play has been highly praised by literary critics for its language and dramatic effect. It was among Shakespeare’s most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with “Hamlet” is one of his most frequently performed plays. Its influence is still seen today, with the two main characters being widely represented as archetypal young lovers. This is the singularly greatest romance ever written and has been continuously adapted to each generation in musicals, cinema and the theatre.

The network allowed Zetas operatives to conduct encrypted conversations without depending on the official cellphone network, which is relatively easy for authorities to tap into, and in many cases does not reach deep into the Mexican countryside.
Your face spells out words that I wish to say. A TelePrompter for me to spit these words into your ears, but you wouldn’t appreciate that. God, there’s got to be something in here worth telling you. But, each sentence you say to me is shorter than the last. Until our conversations die, falling to the ground like an echo bouncing off a leaf. Or a silhouette’s crying shame, falling to the floor after a lover’s perished.
I drive off to sit in a parking lot and within seconds of putting the car in park, Porter wakes up and begins screaming! Not crying, not wining, not moaning, literally blood curdling scream. I hurry and take him out of his carseat, try and nurse him, comfort him, do anything I could possibly do. Nothing was working. He was beside himself, and so was I. After a few minutes I start to break down and cry just as hard as he is. I literally had no idea what to do, so I did the only thing I knew my mom would. I kept Porter on my lap, drove back up to the drive up window, let the guy who brushed me off the last time see my screaming child, and see my ugly cry face self, and explain to him I needed the pain meds NOW.
I then asked them to estimate the distance between the goal posts on the playing field outside the classroom (for the non Aussie’s amongst the readers – there is no standard length of an Aussie rules field).

But a solid world alone does not make for a good novel. It has to have a good story to back it up. Sanderson delivers with aplomb. There are all sorts of interesting things going on here. Magic, obviously, but there’s political intrigue, revolutions, plots, counter-plots, murder and some good old-fashioned betrayal. It also has some very dry humour and the greatest sword since Stormbringer. There are some strong themes too, most notably the novel asks, how are our lives shaped by our expectations? Terrorism and religious tolerance also come under scrutiny, as does the malleability of history. It seems the bar has been raised high since I last read any epic fantasy.
Personally, I want it so much, I can’t not do something about it.

Stanton and Chabon let Carter remain a Civil War vet, but the wars that will inevitably haunt their film are Iraq and Afghanistan. According to the trailer, if Carter does not defeat his enemy on Mars, that enemy will attack Earth next. It’s a one-sentence summary of George W. Bush’s foreign policy. The war on Mars sounds a lot like the War on Terrorism.

The escalation in alien crime has placed added demands on state and local law enforcement personnel.

Proper arrest procedures must be carried out, and complex notification and reporting requirements must be satisfied; otherwise, dangerous aliens can escape prosecution and deportation.

I'm hoping that some solutions and ideas will come naturally to me (mostly because I really don't know where to start) and also because what I want to do most is take the pictures.
But then I found myself watching a lot of National League baseball -- Braves and Cubs on the two superstations, my best friend was a Mets fans, so these were really my only options as a North Carolina kid in the 1980s -- and I came to appreciate the wonder of the NL. It wasn't so much (as people constantly pointed out) that there was more STRATEGY in National League baseball. I have never thought that was exactly right -- there are a lot of automatic choices in the NL.
And I have a dilemma at work at the moment. A job has come up in our office, at a higher grade than I'm on. Lots of people are saying I should go for it and, though I'm not as confident in my abilities as they are, I am tempted to have a go for it. The problem is I currently work 24 hours a week, and the job is 18 hours a week so, even though it is a higher salary, it would mean a cut in wages for me for a few years, and I don't know if we can afford to lose up to £140 a month. That might all be academic anyway as an essential qualification is to have a Degree or a professional qualification - I don't have a Degree and I'm not sure if one of my qualifications will count as a professional one - I need to check with our HR Manager on Tuesday.

Nick and I have both cleaned out our wardrobes, and either sold or donated our back-of-the-closet and bottom-of-the-drawer clothes. I've downsized my jeans from 4 pair to just 2. My dresses have been downsized from over 20 ( yes, this girl loves a dress!) to 5. Nick got rid of a lot of clothes he hasn't worn for a few years. Cleaned out the T shirt drawer ( why we didn't do this sooner, I don't know! I can actually fit all of his clean shirts in the same drawer now), and downsized the boardshort collection to two pair.

The next morning his client called him! This is not a coincidence. They spoke for over a half hour about the energy of the project, how it affected each of them then reaffirmed their agreement to work together on future projects. If David had not taken control the energy would have continued destroying his communication with his best client. He used meditation to know and clear the energy for himself. This made it easy for him to speak with his client in a clear and grounded way.

Before you cook any quinoa, it is recommended to rinse it. While the processing methods used in the commercial cultivation remove much of the soapy saponins that coats quinoa seeds, it is still a good idea to thoroughly wash the seeds to remove any remaining saponin residue. An effective method is to run cold water over quinoa that has been placed in a fine-meshed strainer, gently rubbing the seeds together with your hands.

The Exorcist. Women are agents of the Devil. Eve was the first tempted and since then Satan has been able to prove his existence through them. In this reading, the Three Beggars would be agents of God warning, protecting and guiding He through the events. This would also speak to the discovery that She had been putting on her son's shoes on the wrong feet, perverting and going against nature which is emblematic of Satanism... so I'm told...
It was contrary to human reason to believe Paul. How could he know such a thing? Who ever heard of a god who could lay out the future? All the gods they knew were only a pretence. But this Jew spoke of a total deliverance if they would but believe. How did he know the island was there? It was a divine revelation just as the gospel committed to him was a divine revelation.

Heat the oil in one of those wide, deep frying pans that come with a lid. Add the onions and fry until the onions have browned and become crisp. Add the paste and powder, stirring well for a few seconds. Now add the meat and half of the salt, stir, cover and turn the heat right down. Gently fry for around 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add a pint of water (that’s a British pint – 20 fluid ounces) and the potatoes, turn up the heat and when the curry comes to a boil, turn the heat back down, cover and simmer very gently until the meat is tender, around 60 to 90 minutes if using lamb, longer if using mutton. Taste and add more salt if needed.

The weather yesterday was incredibly beautiful–quite clear, rather sunny, and I didn’t even need a coat, which has been a very rare experience for this calendar year thus far! I hope that as the weather continues to improve in the coming months, that I’ll be able to get out to these locations once again, spend some time just being in them and appreciating this land and the spirits in it, but also doing more walking and moving within it for my own improved physical fitness. It is a good thing, in every way, to be out there in the environment and on the land, even if it is quasi-domesticated city parks…these are the places where my own spiritual history lives and has grown up, and whatever their nature, they deserve appreciation and recognition rather than disdain or scorn, no matter what.
If you've read all my blog posts, you know what a picky eater I used to be. I didn't eat a lot of international foods, my food has to be hot, I don't like sweets or dessert, etc. Add to the list, I never liked creamed soups. I prefer broths - thin, clear broths filled with lots of veggies. The idea of putting a can of cream of mushroom soup into anything makes me ill. I'm getting ill just thinking about it.
You must learn to evaluate every idea or product you’re involved with and not get carried away with the “blue sky” aspects of them. Think clearly and stand firm where your logic dictates. Never a wanderer, you prefer to live and work in one place after you’ve adjusted to it. You work best when you have a sense of permanence to hang onto.

This was more than a blog post. It was my first book review (published at the Huff Post as well), facilitated by Prof. Revkin who directed a review-request by Nation Books my way. “The Invisible Arab: The Promise and Peril of the Arab Revolutions” makes the case for the “invisible” forerunners of the revolution, those who never gave up the idea of a free Egypt: from labor activists, including women, to intellectuals and community organizers. The book was particularly helpful to understanding the commonalities as well as the tense differences between countries across the Arab World—and how those dynamics are played upon by Western interests.
I respect their opinion. But I disagree with it. The way I see it: I have a responsibility to write the best, most insightful and most honest book I can possibly write about Joe Paterno. That's what I signed up for. I'm not backing down from that because of this awful, evil situation. I'm also not walking away from a life and a man. When something this horrible happens, it's hard to hear yourself think -- it's impossible for me to hear anything. I won't add to the noise. If you want to read instant and strong opinions about Penn State and Joe Paterno, I can assure you there is no shortage of howling there.

Actually, in the end I got to talk to her for a bit. Though probably the amount of sentences I ended up saying could be counted on both hands.

Every single one of them deserves to be acknowledged and remembered. Every single one of them had a life and a story. They may not have been good people. They may not have been strong people. They may have had addictions and vices and anger issues and a tendency to leave the toilet seat up. Some of them would have beaten their children. Some of them didn’t even have children. A great many of them died trying to care for their children. Many more of them died thinking about their children, or lack thereof. They may have died with regrets, or with great pride in what they had done.

Of course. But now that I have returned to work (part-time), I must say that I feel ... satisfied. I enjoy going to work, knowing that my girl is learning to be independent from me for a little while. Knowing that she will need these skills to start preschool. I enjoy talking to adults about work-related topics. And I ENJOY knowing that our bank account is not depleting because I am staying at home. Knowing that we have a teeny tiny more of a cushion so I won't feel awful treating myself to Starbucks or McDonald's iced coffee every day. (Teehee)
It has been known for years that green tea has many health benefits. Rich in antioxidants, tea has been credited for helping to prevent and cure a number of ailments. Tea does contain caffeine, like coffee and chocolate, which contribute to the stimulating affect it has on the drinker. Many drink tea in the mornings to give them a boost when waking up and preparing for the day.
So, I think the government has legitimate functions. But I also think our greatest threat today comes from government's involvement in things that are not government's proper province. And in those things government has a magnificent record of failure.
Before this happened, I'd been spending a lot of time praying that God would somehow turn around our financial situation and show me a way I could help out with bills. Now I spend a lot of time praying, saying, "Umm are you sure about this God? Do you really want me to do all this? Maybe you could just let me win the Lotto instead?" In all honesty, I think things happen for a reason and although it's really hard to fathom why at times, I'm just trusting that things will work out somehow.

When Jerry looked into a mirror, he never saw himself as the “Police Officer” type. He saw exactly what everyone else saw, a teenage boy with no friends and an extraordinary lack of female attention. His sense of self was crowded with feelings of inadequacy. Nevertheless, he didn’t allow his shortcomings to drown out his thoughts of grandeur. Jerry’s only dream was of becoming one of Poverty’s finest. So, after four years on the Dean’s List and then graduating from Eastern Kentucky University with a degree in criminal justice, Jerry applied for a job with the Poverty police department.
Couldn’t remember the last time she’d moved so quick.

I'd like to give the builders and the electrical and all the men that have been working on the gallery a big thumbs up! You've done such a good job - it doesnt look like the same place. I wish i'd taken some more 'before' photos, but never mind, youll have to use your imagination. The transformation of the space is amazing! Before, it was one room with rotting floorboards & joists, anaglypta wallpaper, french doors boarded up, rotting window frames.. all the usual pre-renovation features or failures and now, well now its a lovely, modern & dare i say sophisticated space perfect for showing works of art.
I'm pleased that my earlier faves -- Danielle, Becky, and Viktor -- are still on, and making clothes I like! Fallene is stumbling, and seems too flighty for this competition. Not decided on Cecilia yet.
3. It’s always great to include kids when you are organising your Christmas celebrations. A fun way to do this is to use Christmas cookie cutouts to make some cookies that the kids can then decorate on the day, using icing and lollies. To make it even special, package it in a small box that they can then take their creation home in and label it ‘handmade by ______’ This idea could also be used as a cute little present for children to give their nanna and pop or teacher at school.
When you have leftovers, figure out what you're going to do with them. This is key to a good relationship with your CSA box. Whether you intend on compost, preserving or chook food; you really need to figure out what to do with what you don't eat or you're going to disappoint yourself with your waste (which will gradually wane as you become familiar with CSA eating).
We're not really stressin' over the decision though.

So like I said, being a parent to a child with ADHD is strenuous, even with medicine to help your child. It's not a quick fix. Not like I ever expected it to be. It makes it easier for her to focus and do well with school and everyday activities and that is most important. Despite the hurdles I am beginning to realize are still there for me, I will continue to muddle through. God gave me my daughter. He knew what he was doing. There is a reason for everything and I wouldn't change it for the world.

As soon as I saw this post, I knew that I wanted to make this dessert. But, the recipe uses raw eggs that are not cooked all the way through (not recommended for kids). Then I remembered an episode of America's Test Kitchen where they made a triple chocolate mousse cake, with no raw eggs! So I used that recipe instead, and made them into individual cakes. The perfect occasion arose when we went to visit the California Academy of Sciences Museum with my friends Sue and Cecila and our significant others and kids - I made these as snacks for us, but we ended up eating them after the museum, following a belated birthday dinner for Sue.

I took a stab at making a geometric painting (inspiration below). I painted a canvas a shade of grey I mixed, using acrylic paint. It is a bit darker than the inspiration, because I didn't want it to blend in with the basement walls (where I think it's destined to hang). Then I drew the pattern I wanted with a pencil and ruler.

I just realized that of the creatures I saw and heard, aside from the wood duck, the only ones the binoculars helped with, were the-not-quite-identified wader and osprey. Clearly they are best left at home (where by the way, I have identified over 70 bird species while sitting on the back deck with a beer. For this the binoculars are perfect!)

In another example, the fans noticed that these two were wearing the same bracelet and ring that only couples wear. Speculations became stronger than ever when CL, 2NE1′s leader, bought the same ring as a gift for their group so that people will lessen their speculations. CL’s tactic didn’t lessen any of the speculations because it was so obvious that 2NE1 members were trying their best to hide what really is going on. If the 2NE1 members are trying their best to hide it, one of the Bigbang members gave some hints about the couple, or let’s just say he tries to reveal it. That member was Seungri, the youngest member of Bigbang who happens to be G-dragon’s room mate.

After class, I met the American assistant from the other lycee for lunch. We grabbed some things from a boulangerie and went back to hers. It was nice and really hit the spot. I hadn't visited this boulangerie since I left. After some wonderful conversation, I trudged back to the lycee (I think I walk a lot on my little visits) to meet C. for his lunch. Glad I chose not to actually eat with him, because it was some kind of weird fish. But at least, we had plenty of time for a real conversation so we could catch up.

Sometimes I’d argue with my mother about the tests. I’d question the questions that she made. I’d point out that the phrasing was unclear. I’d challenge the range of answers that she accepted, and I’d argue for my answer so she’d correct my test score. I’d also get really mad if she made an easy test, and I’d make her redo the test. She’d get mad because she was already helping me, but I wasn’t satisfied by the tests that she made. But mostly my mother said she really enjoyed making those tests. I guess it helps that my mom is a teacher and I am an eager learner.

It is now up to Haye, whose most famous work, “Biblical Pseudochronology in the Writings of Charles de Gaulle” has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and Chisora, the incumbent children’s laureate, to repair the damage caused by such unseemly behaviour.

As hostess, I stuck with Ezzell’s ratio as best as I could, though I think I would have liked the recipe better made with other binders like egg. But I followed the directions and used the ratio that was given to me, even making it vegan-friendly. I halved the recipe due to the overabundance of bagels on the kitchen counter, and it will make a week’s worth of bagels you can eat for breakfast each morning with a smear of nut butter or cream cheese.
Captain Andy's Rafting was our next adventure. We were going to do a Catamaran but the adventurous side of us decided to do the Navy Seal Speed Raft route. Mike was very nervous and took plenty of Dramamine, I on the other hand figured that I was quite alright. That decision just about came to bite me in the butt later. Depending on the conditions determines how far you can go up on the coast. It wasn't windy at all in the beginning so we rafted on up, stopped a few times to shake our arms (you literally hold on for dear life...and it's a 6 hour adventure!), look at dolphins and sea turtles, and speed on some more. He took us into some caves and showed us many of the small beaches that are only accessible by foot. If fact one of the beaches is where they filmed part of the last Pirates of the Caribbean (I was a year too late at meeting my celebrity crush Johnny). We were about to the top of the Napali Coast when I was getting super seasick. Fortunately for me the man on the other side really did lose it and took all the attention off of me so I could quickly gag a Dramamine down my throat. Then his son was freaking out and crying so our guide decided to make this the turn around point. He led us to a beach where we went on a small hike, ate lunch, and attempted to snorkel (it was so windy that you couldn't see anything). Mike did find a sea turtle that he stalked and swam with. The reminder of the boat ride back took much longer because of the wind, but we finally made it. This was definitely worth doing, but I would take about 4 Dramamine before, and next time we'll do the Catamaran where we can relax! By the time we got back to our hotel and changed we had to leave for our dinner reservations at Tide Pools which was located in the Hyatt. This hotel was unbelievable. So beautiful, and a place we will probably never be able to afford :) Our dinner was amazing!

And please don't think that I feel the bad judgement shown by these parents has anything to do with their age. I think that even though most teenagers/young adults are not ready to be parents, there are always exceptions. That's one reason why I wanted to write the Willow Ryan series, with the main character being a teenage mother having and raising a baby on her own. There are some teenagers out there who are mature, responsible, and selfless enough to successfully raise children, and I find them incredibly inspiring. But these people at the playground, they are just idiots. It doesn't matter if you're 15, 30, or 45, dressing your child in a shirt that proclaims to the world that they will grow up to be a man who sells women for sex is a crime. Or at least it should be. And I am appalled that this shirt even exists.

In the Bible Paul sought to address significant disagreements in the Corinthian church in chapter 13, by emphasizing that love is important over and above all other gifts and talents. But this kind of love is no ordinary type of love, but "AGAPE" love, a love which is selfless, unconditional and voluntary. This love does not seek it's own praise or pleasure, but instead defers to the welfare of others. It is this love that is supreme, for one day faith and hope will no longer be necessary when we see God face to face, yet love will always endure. For this I am most grateful. These are my favorite things!

Like this inmate, many of people who end up in prison have the proverbial odds stacked against them. These are low-income people with little or no education, living in poor neighborhoods, and failing to see that there are any positive options. I only wish that the man quoted above had better opportunities for education in his youth; if he had, perhaps he wouldn't be in prison today. Since he is in prison, however, I'm glad that he's making an effort to improve his circumstances by learning to read and write. When he gets out of prison he'll be able to teach his son that it's never to late to learn.

As of the early 1960s, the most advanced computers in the world were at the NSA, Ft Meade. Research breakthroughs with these computers were kept for the NSA. At the present time the NSA has nanotechnology computers that are 15 years ahead of present computer technology. The NSA obtains blanket coverage of information in the US by using advanced computers that use artificial intelligence to screen all communications, regardless of medium, for key words that should be brought to the attention of NSA agents/cryptologists. These computers monitor all communications at the transmitting and receiving ends. This blanket coverage of the US is a result of the NSA’s Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) mission. The NSA’s electronic surveillance network is based on a cellular arrangement of devices that can monitor the entire EMF spectrum. This equipment was developed, implemented and kept secret in the same manner as other electronic warfare programs.

He was born John Florence Sullivan in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1894. His mother died when he was three years old. His father was an alcoholic bookbinder who normally left him in the care of an aunt. The elder Sullivan did teach the boy the trade of bookbinding, securing a position for him at the Boston Public LIbrary at age 14. Unlike almost all other vaudevillians (and despite having to work hard at part-time jobs to earn his keep), young John Sullivan was an achiever at school. He attended the Boston High School of Commerce for Boys, where he got good grades, did athletics, and edited the school paper. This school gave him his first opportunity to perform, an assignment in salesmanship class to tell a humorous story. One can only imagine the chagrin of the teacher, who’d requested only a mild anecdote to put customers at ease, when he receieved the acid and flowery tour de force John Sullivan no doubt turned in.

Last Christmas, I gave Husband a gift of which most husbands can only dream–a home brewing kit. The resulting beers have been surprisingly good, and my husband now seems determined to work beer into even the mundane parts of life. He would probably clean floors with blonde ale and brush his teeth with lager if I let him. But beer has truly found a place in our kitchen, where Husband finds ingenious ways to fit it into new recipes. This recipe is for Wienerschnitzel vom Schwein (which means “Viennese breaded pork”) and my husband’s crisp honey lager makes an appearance in the breading. He chose to serve it with a sour cream and dill sauce, but sauce for schnitzel comes in a nearly infinite number of variations. Accompanied with bread or red potatoes, this makes an excellent dinner for two.

During the build up to the war The United States made it clear in their campaign of war propaganda that their strongest nuclear deterrence asset was their stealth and conventional bombers. When the decision is made to launch the attack on Iran the first assets that were deployed were stealth bombers from Whiteman, Mo., Maxwell Ala, and Barksdale, La. The United States was fully confident their stealth bombers would approach their targets undetected. The plan was the stealth bombers would unleash their payload so the bombs would strike their targets at the same time the Tomahawk missiles fired from warships located in the Persian Gulf hit their targets.

But when we tried to continue shopping, our luck ran out. We tried a cute little art gallery where Rob's cousin had recently shown his work. Closed. We tried an Irish store we'd never been to before. Closed. We tried another shop that carries quirky, vintage items. Closed.
In 2010, The Economist collated these (and many other) instances together and laid the blame for the recent upsurge in universal value-bashing squarely at the door of CCP conservatives who feared that embracing universal values would also mean acknowledging the superiority of the West’s political system. The truth is that the party would much prefer it if China had its own ‘values with Chinese characteristics,’ rather than troublesome universal values they would have to share hand-in-hand with the decadent West.
The grapes represent healthy cells which are born in the basal cell layer, or bottom of your epidermis, every 28 – 30 days. At around age 30 this process begins to slow down, cycling to about every 40 – 60 days in mature skin. In a normal cycle, the plump, healthy skin cell (grape) pushes up to the surface as part of its natural life cycle. In the process it becomes flat and sticky (raisin) and eventually reaches the surface, dying (oatmeal) and flakes off. As we get older this natural exfoliation process slows down and both the raisin and oatmeal layers get thicker, making it harder for the grapes to move up. As a result, we see an increase in the layer of sticky cells (raisins) and a large accumulation of dead skin on the surface (oatmeal), leaving less room for healthy, plump cells (grapes).
We retain the doctor-recommended Movicol and last used it two weeks ago. I'm not averse to using it when needs dictate. It's hard to maintain the volume of superfood, on days when we are busy or he is not 100%.

“I am really pleased with my game today. It was hard because my opponent fights for every point,” said Saina. “There were ups and downs because one side of the court is more affected by the draft, but I managed to keep the lead in the third game. That was important. I’m really feeling like home here in Indonesia. It’s the third final I’m playing in and I hope I can beat my Chinese opponent. I like to play against the Chinese.”
That's why they call it 'wedlock'. You promise to love each other. That is like promising to﻿ always prefer vanilla ice cream over all other flavors. You can say the words; but you cannot make yourself feel feel love in the future. The heart does not listen to the head in that way. In fact, promising to love is the fast track to losing love. It becomes an obligation. Trapping the one you love is not an act of love; it is the opposite of love. It produces trauma - the basis for mind-control.
This week, a co-worker of mine sent me a fairly upsetting article about the Virginia Tech shootings of 2007. While you may be thinking that the upsetting part of the article must have been details of the gruesome mass atrocity itself, it was actually something more subtle. It was the fact that after all these years, people still have dangerously little knowledge of the very real, very serious threat posed by domestic violence.
For today’s GMT (or actually yesterday’s ), I am sharing a lip smacking Indian chinese bread pizza that is great as an appetizer when you have guests over.
I'm sure that there are some instances where murder is justified, perhaps if your assailant has a weapon capable of terminating you or someone under your protection. Perhaps to relieve someone's intense suffering (by their own explicitly stated choice). That's it really, I can't think of any other excuses.

The two media bodies termed the commemoration of this year’s Press Freedom Day, with its theme as “New Voices: Media Freedom Helping to Transform Societies,” an opportunity to celebrate the fundamental principles of media freedom. It would also serve as an occasion to evaluate media freedom, to defend the media from attacks on their independence, and to pay tribute to journalists who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

Unfortunately, her life circumstances ebb and flow from bad to worse to slightly hopeful and then down again into tragedy. Her only mentor, Mr. Lee, dies early in their relationship, and she is haunted by his ghost thereafter. Yet this is the least of her problems when dealing with increasingly persistent addictions, emotional and physical abuse, and the effects of living from day to day as the 'kept woman' of her emotionally unavailable boss Rashid, who already has two wives and a family of his own.

Finally, after long neglect, the topic of blue tarps appeared in print in a newspaper with the largest circulation in Alaska. (Yes, even I am impressed, at least thirty other people must have read that article, too!) Dirty secret or just uninteresting, I’m not sure why it hasn’t been written about before. Of course, not one to bypass obscure and meaningless topics, I have written about blue tarps, it being an integral part of living in this state, and I being intrigued by certain blights, warts, and general weirdness associated with Alaska.

The defining feature of our school's immediate neighborhood is The Troll. He lives under the north end of the Aurora Bridge on a bare, dusty patch of ground that once provided cover for nefarious doings. He's a big city retelling of "The Three Billy Goats Gruff," except instead of making dinner of goats snatched from the bridge, he's munching on a VW Bug with California license plates.
But surely the price of €1.80 for a paper cup, sugar, hot water and a teabag (with optional splash of milk) should also cover a spoon? Is it not a bit mean, we asked.
So my focus this week is to NOT eat sugar. And to drink water. Lots of water. My body is craving it so much it is waking me at night. Back to basics again I think.

Dredge No. 4 ran continuously (every day, 24 hours a day with three 8-hour 3-man shifts) from 1912 until she ceased operation in 1959. Why did they shut her down, had they stopped finding gold? We asked. The guide told us the mining company had already surveyed up the valley and determined they could continue to run Dredge No 4 profitably until 1968—and that is actually what they were planning on doing—but in the winter of 1959-1960, they had an extraordinarily cold winter and Dredge No. 4 froze so hard into the ground they couldn’t budge her in the Spring, so they decided to shut her down early. They disconnected her bucket line and laid it down on the ground beside her and abandoned her right there at her last operational site. I had a couple more questions for our guide.

When I was a wee tyke, a family friend who worked in the industry suggested that my twin sister and I should get an agent. My loving parents, who also worked in the media, heeded her advice. The first audition I went for was a commercial for a clothing chain and I remember really loving it, having heaps of fun making the casting director laugh. I got the gig, and I guess it must have been a sign, because I continued to work pretty solidly after that.

Jeremy/Jeremiah Healy and Kate Garner were the image of Haysi Fantayzee, while Paul Caplin stayed in the background playing all the instruments and managing the band's affairs. Instead of taking the usual route of sending demo tapes to various record labels in hopes of landing a contract, Haysi Fantayzee leveraged their most obvious feature: Healy's and Garner's carefully constructed image. They put together a low-budget video and sent that around, eventually finding a home with the Regard label. Granted, dancing about in their colorful rags made Healy and Garner an eye-catching duo, but the "style over substance" label would haunt them.

It’s impossible to say for certain if greater awareness of SUDEP by family members, and by the loved ones themselves, could have prevented Jordan and Traci’s deaths. That isn’t the point of this article and of the education work that SUDEP Aware is doing. The point is that people with epilepsy need to understand the reality of SUDEP so that they can make their daily decisions with the full knowledge of the risk factors involved.

Lesson: Rules were made to be broken. It’s good to have a solid handle on best practices, but it’s also important to know when to let go of the reins a bit and let a good idea just be a good idea. Not every blog post is going to leverage money keyword phrases. Not every website layout is going to look like the design trend du jour. But if you step away from those guidelines purposefully, with good reason and a solid knowledge of what your viewers respond to, then you may find your efforts taking on a life of their own.

Award-winning investigative journalist Charles Fishman delivers a persuasive, fascinating, and urgent primer on the history and future of water. He takes you from a factory in Vermont with water so clean it is considered poisonous, to villages in India that have 24-hour-a-day cell phone service but no water service at all. Fishman has spent the last three years circling the globe — from Las Vegas to New Delhi — to uncover how the world of water is changing, and what the enormous implications are for each of us, no matter where we live.

This seems not to dissimilar from the "naif" marketing Carver was given. Look at the photo above: the rough-hewn man of the people, gussied up in a carefully rough-hewn jumper and posed rather slickly against some rough-hewn shingles... if you look at his pose, it seems almost impossible. His arm is so far back, on the edge of that chair, and his head is so low down on his neck - no one would sit that way! They wanted him to look darkly and handsomely mysterious yet rough-hewn. (Oh, and he does.) But the thing is, he was also a serious, professional-minded writer.

I don't know if it is clear in the pictures, but from our elevated perspective, we can see the "old" (and I mean ancient) buildings that look like what Americans would consider a "shanty town," and the elegant and new facade attached to the front of the buildings to hide what is really there. This was done because the Asian Games are coming to GZ in November. The government is trying to "clean up" the city as much as they can in preparation for the Games.

We celebrated our 20 year anniversary by renewing our vows on a beautiful beach in La Jolla, California. We were already going to be in California for vacation and I'd always wanted a beach wedding so it seemed like the perfect time. I just wanted to have our two girls and us in attendance (and we didn't even tell anyone back at home). I arranged it all through the internet, finding an officiant who also did these beautiful flowers for me and my girls. She also helped me with finding a location. We were staying at the Lodge at Torrey Pines and she suggested the state beach right down the road from the hotel.

Rickey’s redemption emerged from a crisis in which his life was on the edge of being snuffed out. But the Gospel entered into Rickey’s life in the midst of a crisis. He then realized that he had a responsibility and an honor, even a “high” that was better than drugs, that came out of sharing what he had gained with others. His sharing was not contingent on the way the message was received—not many people have just said “yes, I want that” to what Rickey has been telling them—but he understands that the responsibility and honor remains regardless of the “soil” in which the seed falls. Rickey received the message of the Gospel through hearing it from Shane, and through seeing it from Shane and his family. Then that message multiplied in Rickey and was passed on to, probably, hundreds of people even in the last 6 months. In other words, it was a multiplying message

This comparison seems to suggest that contamination in that part of North America was very limited, but since such detailed maps hadn’t been created before, it isn’t known what the pre-Fukushima values would have been, and if the yellow areas of around 4µR/Hr (about 2 µR/HR more than much of nearby areas) are areas of heightened manmade contamination or a result of natural variation (due to soil type, etc.). According to the report the manmade (artificial isotopes) component is “up to 1500 CPS” (grey area) throughout the mapped area, see next figure, but what precisely that would mean in terms of activity in the soil isn’t clarified (or in any case I can figure out from the reports).

This corresponds perfectly with his cockier and more domineering demeanor in the Williams era. And after meeting Nyssa in this story he becomes deeply sulky and funerial, as if he knows the jig is up. Of course, the idea that he’s just grumpy about losing Romana is probably the better account.)

This raises an interesting question about the power that chemicals suppliers will have. Many of the current generation of 3D printers are limited by design to using proprietary building materials that are provided exclusively by the machine manufacturers. Proprietary lock-in means that the costs of printing objects may be skewed by this “razor and razorblades” approach. According to Bart Van der Scheuren, Executive Vice President of Materialise, high margins on printing materials are the biggest hurdle to making 3D printing more competitive.

For my last couple of essays for the Sequart site, seen here and here, I critiqued a COMIC BOOK RESOURCES essay from Kelly Thompson entitled "No, It's Not Equal," which is probably representative of this tendency. The essay garnered (as of today) a more than respectable number of comments, a whopping 473 in all. By my incomplete perusal, the reply-thread was marked by an awful lot of people declaiming their beliefs on one side or the other in the most strident of tones. Possibly a better title for the thread itself would've been the one Heidi McDonald used for a BEAT topic on Dave Sim: "The One With All the Comments."
Method – ‘A Mayonnaise of Salmon may consist of a large centre-cut, a thick slice, or the remains of cold salmon cut into pieces convenient for serving. In all cases the skin and bone must be removed, and the fish completely masked with thick Mayonnaise sauce, the stiffening properties of which are greatly increased by the addition of a little liquid, but nearly cold, aspic jelly. When procurable, a little endive should be mixed with the lettuce, for although the somewhat bitter flavour of this salad plant is disliked by many people, its delicate, feathery leaves greatly improve the appearance of any dish which it forms a part. Many other garnishings, in addition to those enumerated above, may be used; the leaves of the tarragon and chervil plants, and fancifully-cut thin slices of truffle, being particularly effective when used to decorate the surface of Mayonnaise sauce.’

Men have come and gone, but some are like fruit flies - resilient little boogers that will WILL NOT go away. And, I seem to be the sickingly sweet nectar they are attracted to. HA!

Rajoy’s Popular Party – give him his due, it’s a great name – has deepened fiscal austerity, reformed Spain’s labour market, and ordered banks to set aside an extra €54bn of bad loan provisions and capital buffers this year. But the banks have now somewhat sheepishly come back to say that’s about a third of what they need. That’s worrying, because translating bankspeak into English, it probably means it’s about 5% of what they need.
tomorrow is my Bright Pink event - anyone going from blogland? - so excited to be going with my best friends n Joe - meeting survivors, families who lost loved one's, people fighting the fight now, amongst other great company - it's going to be such an honor to be in all their presence!!
Most crock pot recipes are simple "dump and cover" recipes. This one is a little different. It requires chopping and browning and lots of ingredients. While this sauce is not the typical, no-fuss, crock pot recipe the result is SO worth it! It's my new favorite spaghetti/pasta sauce recipe.

"And what's wrong with that?"
And I would ride Captain Corelli into next week.
Interspersed in the story are Sonia’s memories of Seb, the young boy who Jez reminds her of. And these parts I found fairly unpleasant. Sonia was obviously enthralled by the boy and would do whatever he asked of her, somehow this willingness to be led jars with the adult Sonia who has taken control of someone else’s life.
The book is rife with hyperbole, and it expects the reader to emote along when told the umpteenth time that something is so at the end of the scale, with the scale being the mother of all scales, that you’re bound to yawn after a quarter of the book. And disbelieve.
There are experts who believe that taking even one drink may be endangering the health of the developing baby. One thing is clear, when an expectant mother has an alcoholic beverage- a beer, a glass of wine or a cocktail- her unborn child takes the same drink. It goes directly through her bloodstream and into the placenta.
The kids actually got me and the hubby a 32" flat screen tv and my hubby got me the cricut expression. I also received some small little items, lotions, scrapbook stickers etc.
Cons: It might still feel disjointed from the rest of the room, and the inbox - the only thing that really needs to stay, would probably have to be placed in a less usable spot, or be cut off from the rest of the display. Also, as I have discovered, gallery walls are hard, and it might still look disjointed.

Died the sound of royal cheer;
That started out with a point, but quickly became Bloggy Masturbation. Like a random erection during the day. “Well, I was going to do something else, but this just popped up and I think I'll take care of it.”
Initially gigging under the name of Tom and Dave they changed to Babe Shadow after too many comparisons to Chas n Dave. They first starting making music together aged 12, busking down Canterbury High Street in Kent, “We had to haggle for our spot morning with the Big Issue skankies” guffaws Tom Cawte (vocals and guitar).They record their demos in the front room of the house the boys share in Dalston. Admitting that their approach to recording is unconventional Cawte equates it to their success, “the people that latched onto us in the beginning liked the sound of house we’re trying to keep it like that, yet it’s not even the sound of the house it’s the sound of that feeling of someone sitting on the sofa playing something. If you’re in the front room you can relax into recording and stay up till whenever eating pizza in my underwear.”
So we’re back, it has been a life-changing experience, there have been a few tears but many, many, laughs. It is something that I have loved doing and it’s bought Nabeela and I closer together. I would not change this experience for anything – and I’d do it all again if I had the chance and would recommend it to anyone (finances and life-situation permitting).
I love life in this country.

I'm Unschooled. Yes, I Can Write. celebrated it's third birthday yesterday (though there wasn't much celebrating since I didn't realize until today that yesterday was the third anniversary of this blog!). When I started writing it, I had a vague idea that I wanted to prove to both myself, and whatever rare reader stumbled across my blog, that unschoolers really do learn things all the time. That unschooling really "works." But as I grew more confident in unschooling, and as my writing/blogging skills improved, I started to focus less on my-unschooling-life-as-it-happens, and more on the philosophy of unschooling, using my life to illustrate the points I was trying to make. I enjoyed (and still enjoy) writing that type of post. Apparently, so do other people! I started, as most blogs do, with virtually no readers (family doesn't count). And now, three years later, just through Blogger's follower tracker (which only counts people who have a Blogger account and choose to follow this blog through their account) I have nearly 430 followers. This blog's Facebook page has over 1,800 fans. This blog has gotten big! And through blogging, I'm speaking at a conference again this fall (possibly two, as I've been invited to a vague conference that may or may not be happening in Montreal, as well), am recognized by name at most education things I go to, and have been asked (though whether I say yes or not depends on a lot of things) for film, radio, article, and blog post interviews.

There’s a lingering perception regarding collegiate riding that annoys me to no end. (In fact, were I to be named queen of the intercollegiate equestrian realm for a day, I’d banish this perception to the farthest reaches of the kingdom and forbid it to return. No joke.)
“What, apart from a Christmas miracle cure?” she asked. “That would be good.” She was proud of keeping her sense of humour. She found it helped other people feel better about what was happening to her.
The “father of the H-bomb” was to his supporters a hero of the Cold War and to his detractors, the personification of the mad scientist. Between these extremes, an intriguing biographer emerges in Judging Edward Teller by Istvan Hargittai ($32.00, Prometheus Books). Teller was no shrinking flower. In addition to his prodigious intelligence he was, as one observer noted, “a monomaniac with many manias.” He gained fame or infamy depending on one’s point of view, when he denounced J. Robert Oppenheimer who led the team that created the A-bomb that ended the war with Japan, but was seen as a communist sympathizer. He is recalled for his fierce opposition to nuclear test bans during the Cold War and, toward the end of his life, as an advocate for the Strategic Defense Initiative. In retrospect, his excesses may well have contributed to the demise of the Soviet Union. He became the prototype for “Dr. Strangelove”, but in truth Teller was a patriot who was totally devoted to the defense of the United States. Anyone with an interest in science and this history of the turbulent times of his life will find the book an excellent, absorbing biography.
The Internet has also become a really cheap vehicle for delivering information. For the last twenty years many companies (dare I say, most?) have turned to the web as their primary means of communication with consumers. Still working with the old school, one-size-fits-all mentality and a general lack of understanding of how to use this new technology, these companies posted a lot of really bad, really complicated information. Because it is so cheap to distribute information on the web, it has typically been excusable to distribute information that is minimally effective. Often companies lack the understanding to even assess that their content is simply not helping. But hey! They had a website, right?

I can't say that I love Squish. I can't say that he appeals to me in the same way that Babymouse does. But. I think for the right reader, the right age group, for those looking for GREEN graphic novels instead of pink ones, this might be a good match. I did like that the graphic novel addresses serious issues like bullying and cheating.

5th Generation's argument heavily relied on information incorporated by reference in the specification of the disputed patent (the '024 patent), where the two patents (the "Stolfo patents") incorporated by reference allegedly supported the proposed construction. The Fed. Cir. generally agreed that incorporation by reference could serve this purpose:

As many people know, the UK scene is a disjointed and under represented world. Even in this Internet age, where you can find the Fitted Cap size of your favourite Technotronic covering Rapper, it’s still extremely difficult to get even the most basic info on the UK Scene. You could lay that down to the lack of investment, cohesion, or media outlets in the early years, or that there was never “that book”, but that is all in the past now. There are of course people like Disorda
Have decided that I can’t skip basic grooming or else I feel like crapola. So my feet are next, but I’ve decided that I need to be more consistent with the shaving, the eyebrows, and the hands too. Being “too tired” is no excuse, because I honestly think it’s a vicious cycle. I’m too tired to shave, so I don’t. And then the next day I can’t wear a cute dress because I still haven’t shaved. So I wear my jeans AGAIN. I don’t blow-dry my hair, I don’t put on makeup, I put on R’s giant fleece cuz it’s the only thing that closes over my belly, and then I stick on a baseball cap. What is the result? It ain’t pretty. And it don’t make me feel so good. So I have even less energy for shaving the next day. I’m not saying it’s time for stilettos again, but I do think there is a happy medium. And now that I’m not teaching anymore, surely I have a little more time in my day for some primping.

Jim also spends a lot of time reminding his readers of his stature, both financial and otherwise, in China. He writes about his fancy car, his lush apartment, his ability to lavish financial gifts on those around him. Two examples will serve to illustrate, but such examples could be multiplied many, many times. In chapter 5 ("Walkabout") Jim recounts how he left his protective hotel to take a walk in the "other China". He abandoned his "car and driver" to walk around Chongqing's poorer neighborhoods. He gets lost, asks some kids where the nearest McDonalds was, and was escorted by fifteen street children there. Jim then describes his arrival at the eatery:

Mangwende gave Chinamora some cattle, goats and sheep to thank him. Between vaShawasha and vaNhohwe there was a great fr iendship. Chidziva was old and he died. The chieftainship of Chinamora was given to Nzvere his young brother.
He adds, “Rates in wind-exposed areas are up 5 to 12 percent as many of the admitted markets are either restricting their capacity or requiring higher deductibles and wind mitigation constructions. The national composite homeowners’ rate is up only 1 percent because it includes millions of homes in locations that do not have catastrophe exposure.”

The emergence of Don’s new wife, Megan – a young, wide-eyed modern woman that is eager to roll up her sleeves and follow in Peggy’s footsteps also portrays the sexual revolution of the 60’s. She performs a sexy song and dance at Don’s surprise birthday party and is teased in the office. Mad Men is entering a time where women are comfortable in their own skin and are gaining power in the office as well as in the bedroom and the men can do very little to stop it.
She pointed out some very good Scriptures, and I was feeling very led to post about it. So I am. ;)

Tomorrow is the next episode of Game of Thrones and I promise to do my best to get a review out to you sooner, but I can’t promise, because I’m at the mercy of a colleague who is getting me the episodes (for which he’s being paid in brownies) and midweek I’ll be rocking out at a Bryan Adams concert. I promise though that provided I get episode 5 before the weekend, I’ll have the review up for you before the sixth episode airs.

I used what I had in the house, which was a very thin, very small, circular bread. Circular is good, but make sure it’s good quality bread and not too thin and not too small. A slice of sourdough would be good, or a flat bread. Of course pizza dough, which you can get from a pizzeria or at the supermarket, would work brilliantly.
Having said that, however, the fact they’re gay is a bonus.

Hey Aaron. Remember when you had long hair and a scuzzy beard and played a manly-as-fuck biker in Erin Brockovich? Because I certainly do. It was a real departure from your breakout role (in In The Company Of Men as a slick, sociopathic abuser of women), and oh em gee me likey. You are so completely masculine, yet so completely approachable: a hunk who likes chopping wood to make into an extension on our log cabin, but then comes in to watch 30 Rock with me under a Slanket on the sofa. What do you mean you want the bit with the arms?! Oh OK, I suppose you did make me that macaroni cheese I asked for – you deserve it. What’s that? You want to let me wear your plaid shirt? Sure, anything for you Aaron. . . Why don’t you get into one of the suits you wore in Thank You For Smoking and I’ll make myself comfortable in the bedroom. . .

Take a good look at the photo and then, using your imagination, put yourself in the picture and dream what you'd like to do. Just to set the scene: it's a beautiful spring morning, there's still a freshness to the air but the sun in warm on your back. On the lake there are white swans and ducks feeding, and people walk, jog or cycle by. The trees are just showing their new leaves and spring flowers are littered underneath them.
In August 2009 I was ranting to my friends about the crazy things I was seeing as I worked on the Non-Profit that I head. I kept running into well-meaning but completely off the mark efforts to ‘save’ Africa. This is all their fault. They are the ones who egged me on to write something and not just hold my frustrations on the inside.

We go from a porno movie shoot (titles of films produced by the duo include Jungle Lust and Lunar Lust) to upstate New York to a werewolf in a business suit riding a bicycle around town (puts the werewolf character in Turkey Shoot to shame), and then back into a back-stabbing hunt for the sword Excalibur with some eastern Europeans, a pair of bungling local cops and Dracula.

At the end of the book, there's a little index of particularly significant lines and expressions. There's a certain taste for the florid on display here, perhaps more appropriate to the future author of "Along Rideout Road That Summer", with its insistent echoes of "Kubla Khan", than to the Sargesonian realist of Immanuel's Land (1956).

The last time I went to Las Vegas was seven years ago when I only visited for a choral directors conference with four other students who had little to no interest in eating anywhere that cost more than $5 or attending any shows and I didn’t really think it would be a good idea for me to traipse around the Strip, alone. Sometimes I make really good decisions.

I'm on a laundry strike this week. I have actually not washed a load all week. I had the kids bring their dirty clothes into the laundry room last night and just stared at them. Not really. I had good intentions of starting washing but I was exhausted from a full week back to work, taking kids to school/dance classes, midweek church, I couldn't face it. How often do you do laundry?
I am a huge fan of "Hell's Kitchen". I think I have seen all the seasons so far. And if they have one thing in common, that's the scallops recipe. I have never tasted scallops before, but I've seen them in the stores, so that is why I decided to buy and cook some!

If your skillet is not heatproof, precook the apples and stir in the cider mixture as instructed, then transfer the apples to a 13- by 9-inch baking dish. Roll out the dough to a 13- by 9-inch rectangle and bake it as instructed. If you do not have apple cider, reduced apple juice may be used as a substitute—simmer 1 cup apple juice in a small saucepan over medium heat until reduced to 1/2 cup (about 10 minutes). Serve the pie warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. Use a combination of apples such as Golden Delicious, Cortland, Gala, etc.
Visiting Varenna will take you along another historical route. This pilgrimage trail leads uphill to the spectacular Varenna Castle.

antique reproductions to create our bathroom vanity...a painted and antiqued pine cupboard. I really want to keep things plain and simple and his vanity fits right in with that vision. I got my hubby to install the bowl sink and the hand pump style faucet. The lighting was purchased from EBay and was handcrafted in Pennsylvania. Last but not least I hung an antique mirror and picture...& a fresh spring bouquet sits on the windowsill.

The story revolves around a highschool boy named Niwa Makoto. He lives with his aunt’s family since his parents are away on business. It is there where he meets his mysterious cousin of the same age Touwa Erio — who happens to tie a futon mattress around her upper body and is a self-proclaimed alien. Her staple food is pizza. Erio had been missing for half a year and was found floating in the sea. She doesn’t remember anything about what happened during that period of time, but she began to think that it was the act of an alien and wanders the neighbourhood wrapped in the futon.

I think it’s safe to say that we didn’t really learn anything. SJSU was clearly out manned and Alabama was never really tested. CJ Mosely looks like he’s got some talent and McCarron did a pretty decent job as well. So, in that regard I guess we learned that we have some talent in reserve, but I think we were all pretty clear on that anyway. Let’s all agree that the Spartans amounted to a pre-season scrimmage game that actually counts on the record.
I've really enjoyed watching the team play this season. These are the five seniors on the team. The team is only allowed to send one gal to the individual singles and one team to doubles. Caroline (on the right) is playing in the singles match today - she is seeded #5 in the state! The gal on her right - Kelsie - is playing doubles today. The doubles team is seeded #2.
In the Guardian article, Eagleman and Tallis briefly highlight their differences. In essence, the conversation summarizes Tallis’s objections to what he calls the “radical thesis” of Eagleman’s book Incognito (reviewed here last July). Tallis accuses Eagleman of limiting the human experience to a mechanical, “zombie” set of brain processes. Rather, Tallis argues, while our mental processes certainly require a brain, they are essentially social experiences, so that studying brain activity is ultimately uninformative. Eagleman agrees that much of our experience is external and social, but he concentrates on how those external interactions change the way the brain works.
Whenever our right becomes the guiding factor of our lives, it dulls our spiritual insight. The greatest enemy of the life of faith in God is not sin, but good choices which are not quite good enough. The good is always the enemy of the best. In this passage, it would seem that the wisest thing in the world for Abram to do would be to choose. It was his right, and the people around him would consider him to be a fool for not choosing.
That's all I've got for now - will have more on our recent travels soon. Hope you're all having a great week. If not perhaps this George video will cheer you up.
5. People mean well but say silly things – I don’t begin to pretend that our daughter’s health concerns are worse than other children with deformities or illness but when people passively dismissed her ailments as “just” this or “just” that or “that can be fixed,” I kind of cringed inside. I know that these people were thankful that her condition was not worse than it was but their comments didn’t accurately reflect what we will be going through over the next 15 years. My wife and I realized that expecting others to understand what we are going through is not realistic. We have to rely on God for comfort and strength and on each other for understanding and encouragement.
Tuesday: Easy Citrus Chicken
I do agree that the overgrown man-child figure in films can be very annoying, but I also don't like the fact we live an a society that worships 'maturity.' Yes, it's important that adults should be capable of earning money, supporting themselves and not behaving like pre-socialisation children (there's a reason all our parents/caregivers taught us the lesson 'If you aren't nice, people won't like you.' Because, seriously, they won't). Note that I said 'capable' - sadly in today's economy, too many people can't do some of these things, through no fault of their own, or temporarily choose not to, to pursue other goals.
As mentioned a couple of weeks ago, we now only display a handful of non-functional pieces: the occasional glass of flowers or foraged plants, the painting on our largest wall, the found animal skull in the playroom (Max enjoys science and biology) and a couple of pieces in our shared office/studio. But we're not forever-attached to any of them. I find that visual beauty abounds around us and does not need to be canvas-bound. Beauty "is in the eye of the beholder" and can be found everywhere and anywhere: In the yellow bird outside of my window, in the light filtering through my chihuahua's ears, in the new shoots sprouting from my living wall, in my kids smiles, and in simple functional items in the home.
Ben is determined to take Bailey out for a nice dinner but you know this is going to be hard to do. This becomes clear when a van crashes through the ER and the driver is hurt. Even though this is the day of love, people still died in this episode and it was very sad. Meredith, who I absolutely adored this episode, helps a woman whose body is attacking itself because she has a tumor. Meredith calls in Bailey, who finds a growth on the womans lungs but this turns out to be the wrong tumor.

Author has provided details about complex procedures, requirement of mentors, strict and long training that goes into making of a Geisha. There is usual back-stabbing, politics and fights among existing and upcoming Geisha as well. It is interesting to note that in those circumstances, the best that a girl can hope for is to be chosen as Geisha. Without that status their life is that of a servant with little hope of any money or care in old age. The impact of war on society as well as the tradition of Geisha itself is very nicely told. I found the book to be quite good though some aspects of various characters can end up confusing you. I guess that is mainly due to complex Japanese customs and traditions.

It may surprise some of you: but the first child is far more likely to re-offend and become a habitual tale teller. Why? Simply, because telling tales is not about telling tales. It’s about connecting to an important adult. It’s checking in. It’s one way children use their round-about way of making sure we are as there for them as we claim to be. Children are very, very rarely direct in communicating their needs.

Die Weste gaan binnekort agterkom dat hulle eintlik nie tanne het nie, maar altyd net 'n grootbek ou Keffertjie was. Klou vas aan daai plasma TV en Xbox solank as jy kan. Jou botox lippe, Mercedes en silikon tiete gaan min werd wees voorkant toe. Hopelik is daar nog 'n ware man of twee oor wat sal kan opstaan as dit moet.

Atheists themselves admit this. Thus having no possible proof of their position, it requires blind faith alone to sustain it. Incredible arrogance is also within them to assume there is no God.
But when I poured it, it poured fairly slow with a great tan head that sticks and good carbonation with a deep amber color. Impressive for the style by appearance, and I hope the taste is as good as the appearance.
If I was here with someone else apart from the kids I’d even be tempted to jump in the spa with a bottle of bubbly and have a bit of, well you know where I am going with this, instead I have to content myself to the sounds of some other lucky couple… And no I’m not going to take a photo of them, and yes Rose the guy has a REALLY HAIRY CHEST, perhaps not quite the stud-ish specimen from your post, but he has quite an impressive display, even on his back. I’m almost tempted to turn, but maybe not while my daughter and sons are upstairs in bed potentially watching.
B) the prosecutor’s office should be ashamed of itself.
When they were little, Walt Disney would take his two young daughters, Diane and Sharon, to play at the carousel at Griffith Park in Los Angeles every Sunday. While his daughters enjoyed their repeated rides, Disney sat on park benches with the other parents who had nothing to do but watch. It was on these Sunday excursions that Walt Disney began to dream of an activity park that had things for both children and parents to do.
I am home after the most wonderful time in Corsica, I even survived the ferry trips and managed to sleep like a baby. Corsica is a beauty. Her magical coastline, lush vegetation and unspoilt terrain made me feel as if I were stepping back in time. Yes there are more populated areas where tourism thrives but there are also enclaves that are untouched by holidaymakers. Corsica is a place to explore, to drive around and discover her hidden charms.
In the interview we learn:
Time for some calculations.
I hope everyone had a Happy Mother's Day. We took my mom to the Flea Market in Grayslake where we each found 15 vintage hankies for about $1.00 each! I've already washed mine so now they just need to be ironed.

The first step in making effective change in our behavior is awareness. So as a start, copy the list of offensive behaviors. After every sales call honestly evaluate yourself through the eyes of your prospect. For example, if you talked for more than 20% of the time, you are probably guilty of all of the first four offensive behaviors.

2. The Surprise. I'll share on Monday, but no it has nothing to do with me.
4) Continue to test trust and look for red flags. I’ve heard it said that true love has no tests. I consider that to be vain fantasy. There might come a time that your partner is no longer interested in being platonic, in which case you must either put out or be cuckolded. If your partner is flirty with others, you should not feel ashamed to say “this is not what I wanted” and despite the possible protests your partner may have, end it and move on.

One thing I would be interested in doing is being diagnosed. It’s been about 5 years since I last saw a psychiatrist and i guess you could technically say that the BPD diagnosis I received back then wasn’t “official”. He just showed me the symptoms in a book, asked me what I thought, and I said I agreed.
I set a target number and gave the child that number of flies to spill onto a desktop. We started with 5 flies. I made a worksheet to record a fly addition sentence: Dead Flies + Live Flies = How Many Flies Altogether? I put the paper in a page protector so we could change the target number. The picture matches the type of flies I found, but I think you could use it with any plastic fly. As long as kids record the upright flies in one column and the upside down flies in the other column, they're good to go. I mean fly!
I guess it’s time to move on to another phone. Suggestions?

I am pleased with the colour combination, and had chosen it to be suitable for a boy or a girl, because I don't knit speedily enough to have embarked on it after the fact. I have voiced my reservations about the Sirdar cotton yarn before, but the finished effect is very pleasing. I am not entirely happy about the stitching up, which you saw here, but I am hoping that the baby won't notice. It has been wrapped up with some lavender bags for a week, so I hope that will ensure sweet dreams.
Matthew had said his goodbye in the wreckage yard, for I was mystified by the calm in his voice when he replied.
I’m a bit down/depressed because of the car stuff. Clint & I didn’t sleep very well this weekend or eat very much so now all I want to do is munch on some cookies I baked earlier and try to relax a little before I have to go to work in the morning.

The sun flips it's polarity every 11 years which in turn causes sun spots to occur. This is called a "Solar Cycle". We are now just barely entering the 24th solar cycle ever since Selenologists have been keeping track. They are very confident about this forecast because of the simulated models made in the past that have had a 98% accuracy rate. The more sunspots there are, the more violent solar winds are produced and the more damage it can have on our electronic grid, affecting anything that requires electricity. Even if you're off the grid and use solar panels or wind-generators it won't matter because the circuits will be fried.
Finally we arrived in Birdwood, we were so busy looking at the beer sign outside the historic Blumberg Hotel that we missed the sign for the National Motor Museum, which is where we wanted to go. Dare I say it we were lost again.

Peter Toohey is a professor of classics in the Department of Greek and Roman Studies at the University of Calgary. He might be deemed an unlikely author of “Boredom, A Lively History” ($26.00, Yale University Press), but the subject, but the book jacket says he “has long been bemused by boredom”, i.e. “lost in thought” by definition.

In here, I painted the walls a pretty gray blue color. We also installed an updated vanity top, faucet, shelf and mirror. I painted the oak vanity cabinet the same color as the cabinets in our kitchen to create some unity between the two spaces and added some pulls to the drawers.
These sheets look nice (white, but not too white), feel nice, have a true deep pocket, and are affordable. Thumbs up.
For the back of the card I made a false back to hide my punched pieces and secure them. I have pulled the back so its a bit loose so you can see in the photos how everything fits in. I made up the back buttons with square punched pieces and a silver pen. The back central panel with the acetate is actually lifted up with 3D foam around the edges so that a photograph can be fitted in as part of the card.

I can imagine them saying that it is my time to give back to my father for all he has done for me. That there are things I will be learning in this experience, marathon that it is. They would point out that it is an opportunity for me to develop and express a selfless love. And they would remind me that my father, even in his condition, matters to God. His soul is intact even as his mind is fading.

As for myself: “I enjoy using the comedy technique of self-depreciation – but I’m not very good at it.”
Is this:
My mobile phone rings. It’s my daughter’s school. She has fallen over and has “a small hole” in her head. I finish my work at ten times the usual speed (I’d like to know how to do that) and head for the nearby hospital. On the roads, nobody seems to understand I’m in a rush and cars loiter and arc lazily. When I arrive finally, she is sitting on her teacher’s lap, draped in a blanket as they wait to be seen. She seems dazed. I hug her and take a look at the cut. It looks as though she has been caught by a stray stud in a ruck. Her teacher tells me how loud the thump was when her head hit the floor, which is not something I really want to recap.
We arrived in Buffalo fairly early, around 8:30ish pm, I think. We ate supper, then attempted to find a hotel. And that's where the difficulty started. The first one we tried was filthy (like really ew), and then the next half dozed or so were scented. Since both Emi and my mom are allergic to synthetic scents, it's really hard to find places that don't use stuff like Febreeze (which is really bad for everyone by the way, regardless of allergies), we have to try LOTS of hotels before we find one that we can actually stay in. Finally, at 11:30 pm, and after getting lost several times, we were stressed out, exhausted, and nearly in tears, when we finally (finally!) found a non sweet smelling hotel! Woo hoo! I took this pic the next morning.

JS - How badly prepared has the SPL been for this eventuality? Should it have foreseen this eventuality or is this something you think has emerged from, I mean, not too many people probably a number of years ago would have thought Rangers might be a club that would face potential administration and further potential liquidation. Has the SPL been well enough prepared for this eventuality?
Had the jury been told that Vincent Tabak used pornography which involved “…images of men holding their hands around women’s necks during sex and photos of women tied up in car boots“, then asked to decide if he intended to kill, it is difficult to see how that fact could fail to colour their thinking.
This is a planting festival. The enactment of ritual consummation of the God and Goddess is done symbolically by placing a knife in a chalice. This is sympathetic magic. The meaning of which is to have a bountiful harvest later in the year.

An early start for this one at the northern end of Bassenthwaite Lake. There was a heavy mist when I first arrived which slowly lifted. This is twenty minutes from my home so I’m often at the lake’s shores with my camera. Very peaceful on this particular morning; did not see a soul.
The Cyclops website also talks of how those selling beer can benefit from the system, to help familiarise them with the drinks they are serving. But if I felt that the staff at an inn or a beer retail outlet were informing me of a beer based merely on a standard formula of graphics and adjectives, I reckon I might feel a little miffed. Particularly when I could have learned that much myself from the Cyclops information printed on the pump clip or the bottle label.
Knowing this was a bad idea, I settled for the hug and the kiss. I was thrilled I got to touch you. And I didn’t want to let go of you when I did.
On that subject, can I take this opportunity to thank you all for your support and kind messages throughout the year.

Seriously, this divorce should not be this complicated. There is no “more” and there are no assets… yet, the WASband keeps running up the attorney bills… I have no idea how he is paying for this. I have no idea how I am going to continue to pay for this. It should have been over months ago… sigh…
If you read my previous blog “A Master Baker I am Not” then you know that I’m on a quest to scatter flour from hither to yon, so when I saw this recipe White Lily Light Yeast Rolls, I thought hmmmm, are they really light? Only one way to find out . . . . bake up a batch. OMGBN! Not only are they light they are yummeelicious.
Obama, defending his “Buffett Rule” call for higher taxes on the very rich, said in a speech that he was “not the first president to call for this idea that everybody has got to do their fair share.” He went on to say:
The ½ of the Lina franchise drew energy from its veterans. From Mick Pennissi and Dorian Pena’s soft touches, to Ronald Tubid amd Don Allado’s antics, to Danny Seigle and Willie Miller’s scoring prowess, quarterbacked by Wynnie Arboleda’s biceps and hounding defense, it was all for the Manongs.
And that was my first experience with alcohol. I definitely understand what it means now to “take the edge off” and it was actually quite delightful.

and idiotic flat screen excesses.
However, that being said, I totally rejected someone based on their sexual background...or rather, the sexual background that he admitted to me...after I joked that I would go out with him for "research". Which included a stint as a Chippendale dancer. Naturally, because I've seen quite a bit of porn, my first question after that reveal was "So, have you ever had sex at a party in front of everyone?" The answer was a YES - in capitals. With an explanation about how exciting it was, followed by a picture of his cock (which wasn't that impressive) and an explicit proposition. I'm pretty sure that he probably has a video of himself somewhere on the internet, and who knows, I may have seen it. Too forward, too creepy, too dangerous for me.
A woman told reporters that when midnight arrived Cinderella left the ball in great haste and the prince chased after her as if he couldn’t stop himself. But when he arrived outside she was gone, almost by magic, with only a gold slipper left as a clue to her identity.

Jupiter owns Pisces, and the Moon owns Cancer. This is another reason why Cancer is an even better place for Jupiter than Pisces. Huh? That sounds backwards? No, there is a very important lesson to learn here! You may be as great as a planet, but you never achieve your zenith of potential except in partnership with other people. It is in cooperation with the energies of other people that we can rise to greater heights than we can on our own. And this is yet another factor making Cancer, not Pisces, the exaltation sign of Jupiter.
My faithful little sign that i've worn for the past year has a simple message, "You are loved." The reverse states, "Life is a Gift".
