"Revenge" (10-11 p.m., ABC): Yes, it's very loosely based on "The Count of Monte Cristo" by French novelist Alexandre Dumas (that's pronounced Doo-mah). Emily Van Camp plays a woman who returns to the Hamptons with vengeance on her mind. Also in the cast are Madeleine Stowe and Henry Czerny. It's not the great fall drama, but the guilty-pleasure mix of mystery and menace does make for soapy fun.

The study offered no medical explanation for why abuse victims might die sooner than others; it was not designed to do so. But Lachs finds the answers self-evident.
Romney compounds his problem by continuing to insist the bailouts were a mistake. His argument is twofold: The companies should have been allowed to go through a "managed bankruptcy" without government intervention, which would have reduced taxpayer risk. And, because the restructuring that followed the bailouts ended up handing large ownership stakes in GM and Chrysler to the United Auto Workers, "the president gave the companies to the UAW." Both propositions are disingenuous. A bailout-free bankruptcy would indeed have been a preferable option in 2008, but it wasn't a realistic one. The automakers needed a big infusion of cash to stay afloat during bankruptcy proceedings, and no bank was willing to provide it, making Washington the lender of last resort. Had the government failed to act, not only would the two companies likely have been liquidated but they would have taken much of the U.S. auto sector — parts makers and other suppliers — with them, causing devastating job losses. Meanwhile, the UAW ended up with big shares in the automakers because the companies were so deeply indebted to the union. That would have been the outcome even if Romney's bailout-free bankruptcy had taken place.

Shannon and Cailey can’t talk. They can make sounds to approximate speech — “Owwh buh” for “I want bagel” — but they can’t tell Beth or Brian when they need to use the bathroom, or when they’re hungry, or when their stomach hurts and they need to go to the doctor. They have the picture books, but sometimes the Aylmers just have to be extra vigilant.

Through her ties to Biebel, McKenzie got involved in helping plan the 1980 inauguration of incoming President Ronald Reagan.
So DART buoys are crucial to providing early warnings to coastal areas likely to be impacted by tsunamis from distant sources. But what if an earthquake that generates a tsunami isn’t far off our coast? DART buoys will not contribute to tsunami warnings if an earthquake or landslide triggers a tsunami that arrives in 10 or 15 minutes. These “near source” tsunamis are not rare, as one area’s distant-source tsunami is another’s near-source event. The massive earthquake in March 2011 that devastated Japan was a near-source event for Miyagi Prefecture, where a tsunami arrived in just a few minutes. For California, the earthquake was a distant-source event; we received about nine hours’ warning.

Another way of looking at stocks is to compare their prices with Federal Reserve estimates of something called book value — what a company would have left if it had to shut down, sell its assets and pay back its lenders.
I fully believe that many people -- especially 20-somethings who typically are more pro-transit -- would not drive if they didn't have to. Who wants a DUI?

In its very first year of operations, the competitive bidding program has reduced overall Medicare spending and the out-of-pocket costs for many beneficiaries. It is a win for patients and their families; it is a win for taxpayers; and it is a win for the continued viability of the Medicare Trust Fund. The competitive bidding program is an excellent example of trying to do things better, smarter and safer.

San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón charged the sheriff with three misdemeanor counts: domestic violence, child endangerment and dissuading a witness. To my mind, Gascón should have dropped the charges. Grabbing your wife's arm and bruising her does not constitute domestic violence - especially when the wife never pressed charges and denied that her husband abused her. The child endangerment count was ludicrous - based on the fact that the couple's son was in the car during the fateful fight. Ditto the dissuading-a-witness charge - because Mirkarimi allegedly tried to stifle Lopez.
Crisp spring rolls ($7.50) glistened (perhaps a bit too much) and were unassuming little numbers until you bathed them in their perky plum sauce.

The patients are different, too. Many cities are home to large numbers of patients with low incomes, who may not see a doctor regularly or at all. For these patients, health problems often are not identified early when they can be easily treated. The Urban Institute found that many low-income people seek regular medical care only when they are old enough to get coverage through Medicare. By then, their health problems may be entrenched and much more expensive to treat.
The investigation is ongoing but no charges have been filed.

The hope in a lost season was McCoy would do something to sway the voting in his incumbency campaign. And while he impressed early, no TDs, a 46.0 quarterback rating and two interceptions -- one he'll remember and one he may not -- managed to put a damper on the early returns.
Stoudemire improved his chances yesterday. He made a surprise appearance on the practice court with his hand bandaged and heavily padded, going through solo running, catching and shooting drills with assistant coach Kenny Atkinson.

"Air evacuation is a waiting game," she said. "People are on alert status up to 72 hours, and you're waiting all the time. Some people, when stress overwhelms them, they hide out in their rooms. It isn't healthy. As senior nurse, you have to find jobs to keep people busy and engaged."

The travel industry worries that gas prices could put a crimp in a resurgent travel industry that was hit by two years of travelers sitting on their wallets after the collapses of the housing market, high unemployment and a steep decline in stock market values. Travel is big business in the United States. Domestic and international travelers spent $758.7 billion in the U.S. in 2010, the last available figures according the U.S. Travel Association. Domestic travelers accounted for $655.6 billion, while foreign visitors spent $103.1 billion. Travel spending has been on the upswing after declines in 2008 and 2009. Travel by foreigners has been fueled in recent years by a weak dollar, making a U.S. trip more attractive. However, the travel industry has complained that strict visa rules that make it difficult for foreign visitors to come to the U.S. have suppressed demand.

Multnomah County is the first in the metro area to install the RFID system - short for radio-frequency identification. RFIDs are devices about the size of nametag stickers that adhere to books, CDs and other materials. The tags store and retrieve data and contain antennas that enable them to respond to radio-frequency queries. They can’t be removed from items without damaging them and will trigger an alarm at the door if the items aren’t checked out.
The sandwiches are served on a choice of white, wheat, rye, spinach wrap, pita or gluten-free rice wrap. Prices include a choice of chips, deli case salads, soup or homemade macaroni and cheese and a crisp, puckery dill pickle spear. Add clam chowder for an extra 50 cents. The chowder was meaty and flavorful but a tad thick for my taste. We opted for delicious creamy potato salad and a bowl of fresh fruit that included ripe melon, grapes and pineapple.

It's clear he's grown tired of the constant scrutiny and sick of answering questions about his displeasure. But team insiders say that behind the scenes Fernandez seems happier than when he first arrived in Portland for training camp, in part because teammates have reached out to make him feel more at home in Portland.
"The one thing I learned early on is that I'm not guessing," Greer said. "It's not my job to guess. I don't want to give the information that's wrong. You'll see Marcus Camby all the time. He'll put his hand up and call plays back to the bench. I don't want to be the guy who gives him the wrong information and we end up defending a play wrong. That's the worst thing that could happen to me. That means I failed at my job.

Midway through the song, Springsteen returns to another of his favorite words. "Where's the promise," he asks in that gruff, husky, world-weary voice he's been using for his sociopolitical songs ever since "Devils and Dust," "from sea to shining sea?" The Boss has been explicit about promises and the cost of breaking them. As he's told us in many of his songs, he believes an American is born into the promise that our communities will be there for us in hard times. But that promise is only as good as our willingness to live up to its terms. Right now, in the hardest times many of us have ever known, we aren't measuring up.

Often after their shifts were over, Burry employees would step across the street to Nugent’s Tavern, according to local history records, just as workers in the Duesenberg and Durant factories had done before them. During Prohibition, however, the tavern was known as the Highway restaurant and was the only place where workers could get a hot, home-cooked meal after work. With the repeal of Prohibition, the restaurant became a bar, which it remains to this day.

Since this third episode is NFL Week, the football theme is piled on, with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer demolishing a tailgate party buffet. The first challenge involves the contestants aiming footballs at cardboard cut-out images of each other, and just to make sure we get the whole NFL thing, pro players Clay Matthews, Tony Gonzalez and Drew Brees come on the field to compete, too (though they stand about a zillion yards away from the cardboard cut-outs, and the contestants get up pretty close). Courtney wins the $5,000 prize, and she's all smiles. For now.
"Because of the rain delays and the late ending of last night's Cardinals/Padres game portions of the NBC program 'Merlin' were interrupted.

This is a bit of a role-reversal. In more plentiful years, California's salmon were blue-collar fish. Enough of them were caught that they could be sold at reasonable prices so even when we didn't feel like shelling out for the big-name, high-ticket Canadian and Alaskan runs, we could afford to eat wild salmon.
There are three distinct events in the Fairbanks competition. In the single-block classic, two carvers are allowed 60 hours to complete their masterpiece.

This may surprise you, but I am not a qualified neuroscientist or behaviorist. However, I think I have stumbled upon a quirk that exists in my own brain and perhaps yours as well. My brain has a pleasure center. Like B.F. Skinner's rats, when I have no other pressing obligations, I generally look for stuff to send signals to that center. There seems to be a certain region of that center that responds to video games, junk food and watching my favorite television shows. I think that I can divert from one by substituting it with another. This sort of makes sense.

"There are two kinds of writers," explained Marshall. "There are feisty writers and there are calm writers." Silver was a calm one until he worked on the series.

Regularly drinking more than moderate amounts of alcohol can lead to many health problems. The overall risk of cardiovascular disease does not rise significantly in most people when they drink more than the recommended amount of alcohol. Some people, however, can develop heart failure from increased alcohol consumption. In addition, too much alcohol may raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Both can put you at higher risk for heart disease.

“I grew up in Hagerstown, born and raised here, love coming back after many, many trips over the years. I just wanted to say that it’s very sad that I look forward to the rainy and cold weather, because of the criminals that we have brought into our town or have allowed to come in our town. It’s very unsafe to let our kids out in the street to walk at night. We just had a armed robbery on Northern Avenue — actually, it was Potomac Avenue, close to Northern Avenue and Long Meadow Shopping Center. There was another at the Sheetz on Potomac Avenue, none of which was ever caught. So it’s very nice, and it’s sad, though, that I like the rainy weather and the cold weather because of the criminals in Hagerstown.”

Favorite non-PC thing I miss: Feeding the bears at Yellowstone. I know, it was unhealthy and unnatural for the bears and led to possible danger for visitors. But after the long, long drive from California, what a payoff to enter the park and right away have bears on the roadside.

Right now is a great time to go back, or to visit the Chameleon for the first time.

The way we look at it, I think everything's in the past. I don't think the next time we play them there's going to be a beanball war. We've been competing against each other, basically the same teams, for four years now. We both want to get to the same spot."

"Last year was a great start to stabilize the population," Chanda said. "Over the next few hunts, we’re going to want to see the population come down. If necessary, we’re going to make adjustments based on what we’re seeing."
Willard watched his team as they absorbed the message. Yes, they had a tournament at-large bid all but sewn up for the first time in six years before losing to Rutgers, and then getting blown out at last-place DePaul on Saturday. And yes, they missed out on the first-round bye in the Big East Tournament, which gets under way at Madison Square Garden today, with the Pirates facing Providence in the opening round tonight. But they had not gone under yet.
Still, investors say demand remains weak because of the recession and supplies remain abundant.
I still can't figure out what possessed me to agree to accompany Jim. He must have been really special to me, because back then I hated exercising. In fact, my most recent exercise experience had been almost flunking P.E. class in high school.

Christopher Columbus discovered Puerto Rico on his second voyage in 1493. He called the island, known by locals as Borinquen or the Land of the Valiant Lord, San Juan Bautista after St. John the Baptist. The Puerto Rico name came later.
That's not acceptable to religious leaders who support family values, he said.
The shift in buying habits partly reflects the changing portrait of the typical vacation-home buyer. In the recent past, the vacation-home market was led by families looking for places with attractions for children as well as adults. But a growing number of buyers are older and seeking vacation homes that transition into retirement homes.
If you're looking for a hard-to-kill hanging houseplant, go no further than the pothos, or Devil's Ivy (Epipremnum aureum). Pothos resemble a philodendron, but the leaves are thicker. The two most popular pothos are the cultivars 'Golden' and 'Marble Queen.'

Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard University, sees many factors behind the shift. "What's driving this is everything," she said. "Having reproductive rights, delaying marriage, being able to go to the best college, having your family be behind you in that decision, looking around you and seeing women can be successful, having professions that were once relatively closed to women be open. It's all of the above."
Participants may customize their centerpiece by bringing their own seasonal decorations, ornaments, and optional wired ribbon.
The council has twice in recent years replaced a member of the council — albeit under less contentious circumstances. In 2009, the council appointed Tricia L.

When asked why he would want to be Sheen's intern, Castro said he thinks the actor "is just freaking hysterical and in a really weird way, he's doing good things." One of the things Castro was referring to involves Sheen's "Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat Is Not an Option" tour, in which the actor has pledged that $1 from every ticket sold will go to the Red Cross to help victims from the earthquake in Japan.
Lazy weekend mornings lying in bed will change quickly. While you and your spouse once read the paper and ate breakfast until noon, you will now have a tiny interloper with you. But never fret, you are in for a surprise: that tiny person invading your bed is the best entertainment ever invented. It isn't until after you have children you realize you can spend all morning watching a 3-month-old play with their toes and feel completely entertained, even disappointed when the show finally ends.
The witness told police she and the wife were driving near Van Buren Street and 115th Avenue to a court for the order of protection when the husband, Leonardo Rodriguez, 37, blocked their car with his 2002 Honda Civic. Rodriguez then forced the wife into his car and drove away, Gonzales said.

What can we say about the "world famous" Sun Tavern (600 W. Westfield Ave., Roselle Park; 908-241-0190) that hasn’t been said before? How about this: You can get better pizza at a half-dozen or more places nearby. Gina Bruno liked the plain’s "burnt cheese" flavor, but Wiener disapproved of the "really weak crust." The Old World pizza, essentially a white pie, is a small step up.
I didn't grow up in Webster, but did live there for several years, and my memories of "downtown" don't include a grocery on Gore. Rudolph's department store was like an anchor in that block, and according to my friends, who were Webster natives, that store hadn't changed in generations. Back in the late '70s, there was a funky downstairs bar called the Artichoke, which I think became Two Nice Guys, and I have a lot of great memories of the old Velvet Freeze on Lockwood.

Airport security has gotten increased attention following the failed Christmas Day attack on a plane from Amsterdam that was preparing to land in Detroit. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian alleged to have links to extremists based in Yemen — and formerly a student in London — is accused of attempting to blow up the Northwest Airlines flight using concealed explosives. He failed to ignited the explosives.
In Paris, couples at Le Meurice can take a chauffeured Bentley to a private yacht that will take them down the Seine at sunset.

Old, new expenses: AirTran employees are expected to get Southwest-level wages, some of the best in the industry. On the other hand, Southwest is sticking with a bags-fly-free, one-cabin business model. It may hunt for a way to make up for the revenue that its former AirTran flights got from charging for checked bags and seat selection.

U.S. Sen. Rob Portman rejected that contention.
Rural communities need modern technology to attract new businesses and encourage growth and job creation among existing businesses. Broadband also enhances the quality of life in a community by giving people access to resources and information and making it easier for them to participate in telemedicine, telecommuting and online learning programs. Given that rural areas typically have higher rates of poverty and unemployment and lower rates of educational attainment, the expansion of broadband would make a real difference in the lives of citizens in these areas.
The Los Angeles Lakers troublemaker also deprived his team of his services as their starting small forward and defensive stopper for at least six playoff games while he serves his 10th suspension in the past decade.

There was a psychedelic Scottish Maharishi Mahesh Yogi disciple who wrote of "antediluvian kings," and the late classy chanteuse of the pensive refrain, "Oh Jimmy Mack, when are you comin' back . . . .," and of course, the miracle of The Miracles.
Pizzas are more like flatbreads with various toppings. I liked the pissaladière well enough, a pizza topped with the elements — caramelized onions, anchovies and onions — that go onto the famous Niçoise flatbread, but the quatre fromages blanketed in four cheeses garnished with tomato and basil is ultimately more satisfying. Pastas are gutsy and delicious, especially a classic penne puttanesca.
While the Chargers peppered Summit goalie Nicole Sparks with 11 shots on the night, Summit managed a paltry two. Every time the Falcons dared to invade the front of the Cor Jesu net, the Chargers' defense -- spearheaded by sweeper Emily Bollinger -- rose to the occasion.
The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, for example, was moved from the GRF budget to the all-funds budget under Gov. Bob Taft. Strickland chose to move the Department of Public Safety and the Department of Commerce completely out of the GRF budget during the most recent budget.

Throw in his shaky second half from last year and … nah, I’m still not buying it. Sabathia’s career March/April ERA is 4.18, the worst of any month. Like his fellow 2009 arrival Teixeira, he starts slowly. His 15 strikeouts in 12 innings indicate he will turn back to his old self in due time.
Of course, in this price category it isn't enough to just build a basement—a common goal is to ensure it doesn't look like one. In Mr. Hadid's Beverly Hills house, what appears to be a skylight above the 36-foot Turkish bath is light refracted from hand-carved crystal panels. Some architects take advantage of a lot's slope, building in glass walls to light exterior rooms. In a few homes, builders have installed long tubes containing light amplifiers that run through the ceiling to channel daylight down. In homes where basements have been expanded beyond the house's footprint, skylights into gardens provide overhead natural light.

Datsyuk took matters into his own hands then, snatching the puck away from Josi and sneaking it into Nashville's net, at 15:03. Franzen's would-be goal snuck beneath an outstretched Rinne's right arm, a split second too late, leaving the Wings trailing by a goal going into the third period.

Rather, GOP control allowed Republicans to keep intact many of the cuts they enacted during the state's deficit years. This set a "new normal" for state spending -- $8.57 billion for fiscal 2013 -- that Brewer and legislative leaders say they won't reverse even as state revenues rebound.

Sept. 20 is not the only day on the calendar to host two "hat trick" innings from the Cardinals. July 21, a day known for remarkable things happening (Ernest Hemingway was born on July 21, Neil Armstrong stepped foot on the moon on July 21 GMT -- yes, July 20 in the States -- Pink Floyd performed "The Wall" on the site of the Berlin Wall on July 21, etc ... ), has also had two three-homer innings from the Cardinals. The first in 1956 and again in 1966.

Officials at Southern California Edison, which operates San Onofre, said a detector picked up the radiation in a building next to Unit 3. But no other sensors on the property showed any change in radioactivity.
Snyder and Bing later relented and said they would support a smaller version of the Woodward rail line. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood gave the M-1 group a 90-day period to conduct a feasibility study showing that there was sufficient need  and private funding  for a rail line.
"It's hard to describe how important it is to players in Alonzo's position to know an NBA team thinks you're good enough, even if only for 10 days," said Snyder, now a Los Angeles Lakers assistant.
From 1977-86, five of the 10 overall No. 1 picks were running backs. But there has been just one -- Ki-Jana Carter by Cincinnati in 1995 -- in the last 25 drafts. In that same period, only six running backs have been taken at No. 4, where the Browns could add a seventh in Richardson. The most recent was Oakland's Darren McFadden.
Before this dispute escalates further, Welo and Kleem need to offer to step down and reapply. Then, both sides should send the lawyers back to their corners so there can be an amicable meeting of the minds -- or a swift outside ruling that doesn't prolong the damaging standoff.

The Escape has many competitors, including the top-selling Honda CR-V with a starting MSRP, including destination charge, of $23,325 for a 2012 base model with 185-horsepower four cylinder, five-speed automatic and front-wheel drive.

The next day in Madras, the small group is remarkably cohesive on the silent group tasks ("Without talking, get in line by the order of your birth month and day ... Without talking, form the face of a clock ... Now form a school bus. .."), but more reserved verbally.

In 2006, Mr. O'Malley, then a candidate for governor, successfully sued to force the Public Service Commission to reconsider a 72 percent rate hike and to take into account the potential benefits of Constellation's planned merger with Florida Power & Light. He also tried to make executive compensation part of the PSC's deliberations, but a judge rejected the idea. In 2009, when Constellation was trying to sell half of its nuclear business to Electricité de France, Governor O'Malley demanded an average of $200 in rate credits for every consumer, bigger company contributions to a fund that helps low-income customers pay their bills and for the company to cancel a "golden parachute" for Mr. Shattuck.

If you are selling your home, the only thing that can matter to you is the terms and conditions of an offer on your home. Is the price offered acceptable to you? Are the other terms of the offer acceptable? Does the buyers' timetable work for your family? Will the buyers be able to obtain the financing they need to complete the purchase? Whether they are young or old, married or single, have kids or no kids or what color their skin is are things you cannot legally consider. Likewise, whether you think they will be happy in your home or fit into the neighborhood cannot be part of your decision to accept or reject their offer.

Two days after drilling Washington 82-57 in Eugene, the Ducks (18-7, 9-4) slugged it out with a Cougar team coming off an 83-73 win at Oregon State. After walloping the Huskies, Dana Altman said he would happily take a final stat sheet that read 16 assists to 11 turnovers (those were the numbers Thursday) and that's what the Ducks did again on Saturday. Most important: only two of those turnovers came in the second half, when Oregon was able to pull away from a slim 36-33 halftime lead.
During those years when a federal gas tax increase was being considered, proponents of what a New York Times headline dubbed the "50-cent-a-gallon solution" typically proposed to balance the wallop at the pump with a break on income or other taxes.

I was able to look at other opportunities that were out there . . . but it really always came back to St Louis. I really think there is a lot left to be done in St. Louis and that there's a lot of opportunity in St. Louis.
Kenton said his biggest fear is seeing both state support and enrollment decline. In the last few years, revenue from record enrollment, including an increase in out-of-state students, has helped the university system offset declining state support.
When he arrived at the rim, he delivered the dunk with the force he's become known for.
Pat Nangle once wrote a book called "The Antiquer's Guide to St. Louis." Up until 2002, her house in Ballwin was filled with antiques. And even though she loved them, she knew she was ready for change.

Gabriel Schonzeit, who was sitting in the third row, said the captain said there could be a bomb on board the flight.
A: We never put a set number on it. It really depends on our individual game plan each week. It’s more of what he can grasp. He’s always had a great football mind and has picked things up really well for us. Obviously, with the departure of LaMichael, there’s a lot of carries to be distributed. I’m sure Kenjon will get a lot of those, but De’Anthony will get some of those, too. But I don’t have an exact number.

"I'm just a little emotional right now. I can't be more happy for the team. I just feel so privileged for getting here. Be the first to bring home a state title for Althoff. ... Get your name in the books ... It's something special. I'm up here with the team."

The shot: I shot with a Canon 7D camera, with a 16mm-35mm zoom with the aperture set at f/4.5, and I left the shutter open for 30 seconds. Standing next to a roaring waterfall means bringing towels and plastic bags for your cameras and a rain poncho or waterproof jacket for yourself. While taking this shot, you'll feel the heavy mist (which can feel like a heavy rain); just remember to wipe water drops off the front element or filter of the lens and keep your cameras dry.

Vehicles passing through, but not parking, were not included.
"He's young and he's going to go through some ups and downs," Casey said. "He's swinging the bat good down here but I think one thing that's getting overlooked is how well he played third base today. He was a big part of the no-hitter, making two plays that kept the ball from getting through."
"He's a very intriguing gentleman," Howard said. "He's well-educated. Well-spoken. He cares. He also is a human being."
Most of Price's customers are baby boomers with disposable income who are looking to spend time together and get some exercise. It's not a cheap activity. Tandems can run from a low-end of $1,000 on up to custom, high-performance bikes for $20,000 and more.
To be sure, Braque—and his fellow Cubist Picasso, who also stayed in Paris—had a precarious position during the war, for the Germans considered them "degenerate" modern artists. More threatening, for the duration of the war, Nazi officers would be installed directly across the street from Braque's Paris home and studio; Braque biographer Alex Danchev recounts the artist observing that when the Nazis question people, they do so "with guns in their pockets."
In the end, Valor Christian wore down the Sailors with its size, strength and numbers en route to a 41-14 win at Legacy Stadium. The victory gave the Highlands Ranch school a state championship in its second year of varsity competition.
"I HAD BEEN ON the ground maybe 45 minutes at this point. Off to the left, a group of people – women, children, and babies – were standing around. The machine gunner was standing in front of them with the ammo bearer and all of a sudden I heard this fire and here the machinegunner had opened up on all these people in the big circle, and they were trying to run. I don’t know how many got out.
Chavez spoke in a telephone call on state television on Monday for the first time since he traveled to Cuba a week earlier. During the past week, he instead communicated with supporters through messages on Twitter.

Jerry Sandusky is a big overgrown kid, Amendola said. Hes a jock, and for anybody whos ever played sports, you get showers after you work out.
Four years earlier we had bumped into each other on another dating site. But there had been something about the snapshot he had on his profile — one woman pulling him, another woman's disembodied hand cautioning him, his eyes and smile flashing in another direction (clearly at yet another woman in some club, I thought) — that gave me pause.
Officials on the scene said winds were blowing about 6 mph from the southwest.
If Mark Valentine doesn't get his event in the Guinness Book of World Records, it won't be for lack of dogged determination. Valentine, a Kansas City promoter, plans to parade more than 700 costumed dogs, most of them Chihuahuas, through the Crossroads Arts District on May 5.

Even Lou Harrison, whose creative voice is characteristically marked by lyricism and sinuous melody, was drawn into the evening's maelstrom. His Organ Concerto, scored for a collection of percussion instruments alongside the soloist, begins and ends with fierce, oratorical movements, and it got a superb performance with Paul Jacobs as soloist.
“I’ve been told not to talk, but these stooges don’t scare me,” the letter said. “Threats or no threats, I’ve laid bare the coming race war in our big cities. The federal-homosexual cover-up on AIDS (my training as a physician helps me see through this one.)”
A little sunburned, we hopped the bus back to Bridgetown. In Barbados, they drive on the "wrong" side of the street, island music blaring, pedal to the metal. The bus was filled with schoolchildren, men with live chickens, women with food to sell in town, fishermen with covered buckets of eels - and us, the only tourists, hanging on for dear life.

Thanks to a lawsuit you can look me up by name online to find out my monthly retirement benefit along with the more than 100,000 other retired Oregon public workers.
Mickelson, who is known for his magical shots around Augusta National, created a different kind of memory Sunday. The three-time Masters winner carded a triple-bogey on the par-3 fourth hole. He said his tee shot hit a railing near the grandstands and shot into the woods left of the hole. He tried to hit two right-handed shots out of the woods before hitting a pitch into a bunker. He hit a great sand shot, or his score could have been worse than triple-bogey.

Under Schissel's baton, the orchestra sounded as crisp and confident as ever in Elmer Bernstein's Overture to "The Magnificent Seven." Brown, too, seemed to be fine form, rendering a thoroughly relaxed "Summertime" evocative of a much nicer day.
At the Nylon house, they met up with the rest of the band — bassist Lee Williams, keyboardist Scott Gardner and drummer Justin Wilson. When they're partying, Smith is the watchful paterfamilias of the band; as he surveyed the tanned muscle and model scene at the pool, he seemed to keep an eye on Kandel. "She's a younger girl in a band," he said. "We look out for her. One time these guys at a show told her we were all going to an afterparty and gave her a ride there. She called and asked where we were, and no one had told us about any afterparty. It was sketchy. She's like our sister."

Low-dose vaginal estrogen (creams, tablets, and a vaginal ring called Estring) acts predominantly locally, mostly in the vagina. It relieves vaginal dryness, burning, and pain with sexual intercourse, but not hot flashes. Vaginal estrogen doesn't raise blood levels of estrogen enough to stimulate the overgrowth of endometrial cells, so it's thought that progesterone isn't needed. So far, no well-designed clinical trials have evaluated systemic risks, such as breast cancer or blood clots, in women using low-dose vaginal estrogen. But it's unlikely that the risks are similar to those of systemic estrogen.
He even had some fun joking around with running backs coach Gary Brown, whom Richardson knocked down during a drill at his Alabama Pro Day. In the afternoon session, Brown kidded during a drill, "Please don't knock me down!"
Citizens said there has been no policy change. The company still won't pay to fix the problem, but after a "more detailed" inspection of the Ivorys' home, it found "signs of corrosion on pipes and wiring, however not to the extent warranted for non-renewal," a letter to the couple stated.
Plakas said it's a world different from the time when farmers would lease land for $10 or $15 an acre, with operators setting up see-saw natural gas "grasshoppers" that almost blended into the landscape like rusty farm equipment.

Realogy’s current lease expires in 2013, and the company will move into a new, environmentally friendly facility on a 15-acre site on Park Avenue in Madison as soon as late 2012. The company considered locations in other states, but chose to stay in New Jersey because of financial incentives it received from the state Economic Development Authority and efforts by the Christie administration, said president and CEO Richard Smith.

"That legislative redistricting is orchestrated by political figures and consistently has had significant political consequences suggests that political motives figure prominently into the process," said Benjamin Brickner, the report’s author. "Just how prominently can only be guessed, however, since the commission holds few open meetings and produces few written records of its deliberations."
As the overall arbiter of safety and fairness in the country's transplant system, UNOS has the power to issue public rebukes and urge the government to close troubled programs.

Several major Champagne houses that are consistent favorites, Billecart-Salmon, Krug and Ruinart to name three, weren't represented in the tasting, but the panel still had an opportunity to taste a few standouts, like the 2002 Roederer Cristal Brut Rosé, which was very special indeed.
What makes a good margarita? That's easy: high-quality tequila, fresh lime juice and orange liqueur.
Despite increasingly strong upward trends in positive public attitude for same-sex marriage, it is remarkable how this issue remains to be politically volatile. The Respect for Marriage Act passed the Senate Judiciary Committee strictly on party lines, as it has been speculated that there is not enough votes in the Senate to override a filibuster. It is even more unlikely to pass the House where conservative members have gone so far as to hire a private legal firm to defend DOMA's alleged legality in court.
In the next two years, Maryland schools will switch its curriculum for all grades in English and math, change its state tests and institute a new teacher evaluation system, all major transitions that Lowery will have to navigate without experience in the state.

DePiero was not charged with a crime or even mentioned by name in the criminal charges filed Friday against four men, including former Parma school board President and onetime DePiero rival J. Kevin Kelley.
Bioscience High uses a learning approach that avoids lectures and teaches students through hands-on projects. Teachers design projects that require students to learn basic skills to solve large problems.

Chris -- who insists he's the handsome one of the pair and Francis is the brains -- wasn't interested in college, he just wanted to work. Francis went to the Coast Guard Academy and studied engineering. Their father transferred to a job in Oregon, and eventually the brothers followed.

Above all, Cavanagh appreciates the opportunity to represent plaintiffs. “It’s gratifying to represent individuals when the results truly matter to them,” he says. “In some cases, our clients’ very survival is at stake, especially if they’re terribly injured and need compensation for their medical care; so I’m happy to be on the side I’m on.”

That, too, is the concept behind our "One River, One Problem" approach.

Then there are the two framed golf balls, mementos of his holes-in-one. An ancient hickory-shafted putter.

Sebastian Lopez was the son of Spanish immigrants who, along with 8,000 others, left Andalusia as peasants in 1907, having been promised work on Hawaiian pineapple plantations.

Those opposed to the notion point to the fact that since the National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 raised the drinking age to 21 in all 50 states, roads have become safer and kids have delayed the onset of drinking. Underage alcohol consumption is still a problem, they note, but lowering the legal age requirement would do nothing to combat it.
The Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve will remain open under an agreement with the nonprofit Bodie Foundation, which plans to start charging parking fees at the reserve.

It's tricky to play advocate for a movie so steeped in violence. Of course what Frank is doing is wrong; we know this going in. This is satire, after all, and it won't be for everyone. Goldthwait knows this and seems to revel in it. When he is on his game -- as with the "American Idol"-style show and its passive-aggressive ridicule, or the Fox News-like personality whose obnoxious rants reveal a smug self-righteousness that nevertheless sounds like the kind of thing you can hear every day -- his film registers with anyone fed up with media manipulation.
Washington County hasn't decided whether to appeal to the Oregon Supreme Court. Sheriff Gordon is on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment. Douglas County Sheriff Winters also couldn't be reached for comment.

The other thing house/office plants can't live without is water. At home, you've got faucets all over the place - in the kitchen, the bathroom, the laundry room and maybe even on the patio.

When he locks in the Republican presidential nomination, Romney will make history as the first Mormon nominee from a major party. His faith is central to him and to his family — he spent two years in France as a missionary, a time when he lived in occasionally primitive conditions. When he returned home, he attended Brigham Young University, a Mormon school, and married his wife, Ann, who had converted to Mormonism.

And he has treated listeners to taped insight of former Mormon president Ezra Taft Benson, who considered the civil-rights movement a "communist conspiracy" meant to ruin America.

Talbot's enthralling, news-driven history of those two tumultuous decades starkly reminds us of the nightmare of violence and divisiveness that followed the dreamy days of peace and love. The Summer of Love devolved into the Zodiac killer. The civil rights movement gave birth to the terrifying black-on-white murder spree of the Zebra death cult. The antiwar movement spawned such deadly fantasies as the Symbionese Liberation Army, the kidnappers of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, and the New World Liberation Front, which bombed the homes of San Francisco politicians whose only sin was the voting record of a moderate Democrat.

Civic groups have proposed alternative work programs, including a "dial-a-snake-charmer" service to remove pests for homeowners.

In part, it's because of these one-game playoff (or play-in) games that will now be contested between wild-card winners. One-game playoffs have a sacred place in baseball history.
