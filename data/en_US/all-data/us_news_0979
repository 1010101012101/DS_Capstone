According to the Engine Rebuilders Council, a remanufactured engine that is completed by a trained professional usually has a warranty rate of 5 percent or less. Not every engine rebuild is certified by top automotive manufacturers, and strict requirements must be met before engine sellers can use registered trademarks for remanufactured engines branding. Some of the regulations include oil compression tests, ignition tests and mileage certifications to ensure that consumers are well informed about an engine that includes a trademark like Ford, Dodge or Chevy. The industry standard warranty for a rebuilt engine is approximately 1 year or 12,000 miles. The warranty extension by RemanufacturedEnginesforSale.com now exceeds this warranty coverage period by 24 months to help cover damage to rebuilt Ford engines for cars and trucks.

There is serious confusion about the basis (legal or otherwise) for redefining an ancient human institution (marriage) to fit the social mores of 21st century society.

Since the first column I wrote about hotel guest profiles more than a decade ago, I've been deeply concerned about my own privacy as a traveler. Any time a hotel delivers my favorite newspaper (this one, of course) or leaves a fruit basket with apples (Pink Ladies) I get a little suspicious. How did they know?

No one is more eager to get started than Dutton, 36, one of the league's all-time best at his position. In the 2011 season opener at Spokane, Dutton played superbly into the fourth quarter before tearing his left Achilles' tendon. He did not return until the Gladiators' opening-round playoff loss to Georgia; playing well in relief of a struggling Kurt Rocco.
Karzai told a meeting of his Cabinet that the attacks represented "an intelligence failure for us and especially NATO," according to a presidential palace statement.

Thus, Millier today is overseeing the output of between 350,000 and 400,000 cases annually, and quality has likely never been as consistent and as high. His current lineup includes a 2009 reserve Sierra foothills chardonnay that is classically Californian  rich, ripe, spicy and smoky  yet agile and crisp. His 2010 Lodi old-vine zinfandel is an unusually youthful and lithe take for the genre, yet sings with fresh varietal character.
Kuntupis and Peals are still fighting to regain custody nearly two years after losing both children: Stephanie, now 3, and her older brother, 14-year-old Romero. Their struggle stings all the more because the Cruz-Reyeses regained custody of their children -- then 11 and 13 -- roughly two months after Stephanie was hospitalized.
For decades, residents of Gozo -- they're called Gozitans -- were ordered to spend every night within the fortress walls. Today, these walls hold museums of archaeology, folklore, natural science and church history, the latter of which is next to the Cathedral of the Assumption, built from 1697 to 1711. After visiting the cathedral, I toured its museum, and was curious about a small but amusing collection of papal shoes.

Consider the little boy who had never had a book read to him until that first day of school. And the girl who gave a quizzical look when she was told to put her toys on a shelf. She didn't know what a shelf was. And the boy who was trying to put together a puzzle above his head -- in the air -- rather than on a flat surface. He'd never seen a puzzle before.

Practice, practice, practice. It's paying off.

The National Religious Campaign Against Torture was formed in 2006 to be the interfaith religious voice urging a return to our moral values and to hold accountable those who violated these values. I join the organization in calling for the U.S. government to convene a commission of inquiry to investigate — and to understand — what led to our use of torture. The next step will be to seek accountability and codify laws that will not permit this descent into immorality again.

Hey, Tony: As good as it looked to get Peyton Hillis in a trade for Brady Quinn, how bad would it look if Hillis walked away and we got nothing in return? Knowing now what we do of the WCO, if you could call a mulligan and maybe just tweak last year's ground and pound instead of completely switching schemes, would you? This upcoming draft could either make our defense elite or make our offense watchable, what direction do you choose? -- Eliot Clasen, Cape Coral, Fla.

"I wore my own clothes back then, which were not very good, and I cut my own hair, which also was not very good," Williams said. "I still remember the feeling that in this room, unlike others, that that was OK. Possibly even preferred.

Obama: A fourth-straight year of trillion-dollar deficits is projected. Federal spending is estimated at 23.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, up from about 20 percent in previous administration, and is forecast to decline to 21.8 percent by 2016. Won approval to raise debt limit to avoid default. Calls for tackling the debt with a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases.

Also, would set a 30 percent tax rate on taxpayers making more than $1 million, increasing taxes for some but not all millionaires and billionaires.

Cataract Canyon: From Laurel Dell picnic site, turn left on the Cataract Trail for a 1-mile descent into the canyon to see Cataract Falls, a series of pretty cascade-type waterfalls in a lush setting. The trail leads all the way down to Bolinas-Fairfax Road (670 feet elevation) west of Alpine Dam (parking areas fills up here Sunday mornings). The canyon's prettiest falls are at an elevation range of about 1,200 to 1,400 feet, within 0.5 to 0.75 miles. After spring rains recharge the watershed, the canyon rates a 10.

Once the list of musicals appeared on the blog, I heard about some titles I'd missed. So, with the help of several correspondents, here's an expanded list of Chicago's long-running Broadway shows. I'm not including reprise engagements, which is why I don't include the fast return of "The Lion King." (Sorry Disney, but you were too slow to trust Chicago audiences). Hope the list jogs some pleasant memories:

"One of the things I get asked almost universally is, 'Is it noisy when it rains?'" Hickman said. "That's where we came up with the slogan. I think what they're thinking of is how noisy (tin barn roofs) are when it rains, but those roofs were open rafters. You could see the underside of the metal roof and certainly it was noisy, but that's not the case in modern construction. That's one of the objections I have to overcome is the perception that it's noisy."

One of MOCA's biggest challenges, Deitch said, is raising money for shows like "Ends of the Earth," which documents an important development in art but lacks star power. It's much easier, he said, to raise money for shows by popular figures, "where collectors are excited about the artists and brands want to be connected to the artists' image. Fundraising for historical shows with great artists who don't include today's art-world stars is a great challenge."
