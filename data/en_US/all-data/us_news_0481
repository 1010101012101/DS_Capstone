Leslie McKown Enriquez, Sandy, Utah: I remember family nights. With five kids, four brothers and me, this was all my family could afford. My Dad went to school with Ray Lane so we would wait till after their broadcast was over and talk to him. I thought that that was neat! I was old enough to enjoy 1984 and the World Series. I went to many games that year, and got one of the first copies of the Free Press with Kirk Gibson on the front! I took my Dad, husband, daughter and son to a game on a visit to Detroit. That was my last game at the ole Stadium. Even though I don't live in Michigan I still love my memories of Tiger Stadium.

"Mamma and I picked out our place to sleep and spread a horse blanket out under a tree, whereupon a scavenger (wagon) loaded with Italians camped in front of us.

As 'Mary' is Mamma's name, every time he spoke to 'Mary' Mamma awakened and, to my amusement, answered, thinking Papa had come."
Looking back, I realize how lucky I am to carry an American passport. It's an all-access pass to see the world. And you don't need a year to take the trip of a lifetime. I saw parts of the world I had only dreamed of, met wonderful people, and got a glimpse of the lifestyle of a real world-traveler - and I only needed a month and $7,500.
Those tactics included substituting a synthetic egg, mimicking the size, color and weight of the condor egg, for the parents to tend while the bad egg was replaced. Yes, a synthetic egg. NPS biologist Jess Auer says, "Condors have a very poor sense of smell and weren't able to discern it wasn't their egg." Suffice it to say, the birds lovingly tended their artificial charge until those resourceful rappellers replaced the odd egg with a viable egg from the San Diego Wild Animal Park's captive condor-breeding program. Good parents that they are, Esme and Gilbert shared in the egg's incubation, and a new condor chick came into this world in late March, just a few days after the onset of spring.

Between the two of them, it was possible to see what might have attracted customers to the old J.A. Murphy's. Maybe it's time for the owners to pull a Piratz Tavern and return to their old ways. If not, the bar's name might prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.
“We’re only going to score 17 points?” Brady chuckled. As it turned out, Burress underestimated his defense.

"Noor was one of the most important channels that Iran was using to get its oil revenues," said a person briefed on Treasury's action. "It was a huge node."
And you will be distracted by the small and medium plates on the menu. Samson is half-Italian and grew up with the taste of Italian food. He also did a short stint as chef at Valentino. The surprise is how gutsy Sotto's menu is, filled with regional Italian dishes, mostly from southern Italy, few of them seen in these parts much. Dishes like pig coratella, a rustic dish of pork innards sweetened with oven-dried tomatoes and served with grilled bread. Each bite carries something different. Or lamb belly agrodolce, braised in a sweet-tart sauce dosed with vinegar.

Ask Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., who heads the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and he'll tell you about the overall benefits to the aviation sector.

No doubt there will be some trickle-down benefits to passengers from what Mica called a "long-term blueprint for aviation programs."

As to why so many horses seem to breaking down, the Times finds no new answers. Drugs are and have long been the culprit, and the innovators on the performance enhancement side will always be ahead of those on the testing side. (Though some of the ingredients being used -- Viagra, cocaine -- are absurd.) A horse doped up on painkillers will literally run until his or her leg snaps. Think about that.

Thankfully, the Internet has allowed more dissenting voices to be heard despite the din from the media echo chamber. To a media monolith that talks incessantly about pro-Obama "birth control moms" and treats "women's health" as synonymous with abortion on demand, and to a calcified feminist establishment that long ago lost any credible claim to speak for the majority of women, these First Amendment moms and pro-life feminists are countering with their own narrative. They are refusing to let a narrow slice of ideologues set the agenda for the rest of us. And they are putting politicians on notice: Pay attention to the complexity of women's experience and the diversity of our opinions, or prepare to pay come Election Day.

* I know it's convenient to blame the umpires for Tuesday night's loss at Wrigley Field. And the two blown calls were so bad, so inexplicably incompetent, that I thought that MLB had assigned NHL officials to Cards-Cubs game. And yes, the Cardinals' bullpen deserves to be chastised for blowing a save Monday and Tuesday in what became the worst losses of the season to date. It's easy to dump these awful 48 hours at Wrigley on the umpires and the Cardinals' late-inning guys.

According to Springsteen, he'd first fallen for the stories -- and the hard stoicism -- of country music. But even as he was attracted to the fatalism of country artists like Hank Williams and Jerry Lee Lewis, he found something toxic about those singers' resignation to cruel fate. The Boss wanted an answer to the implicit question posed in Williams' "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It": why, he wondered, were hard times permanent for working men and women? In Guthrie's work, he found a way forward: "fatalism tempered by a practical idealism," and a conviction that "speaking truth to power wasn't futile."

Caro is a conventional liberal of the Great Society sort ("Unless Congress extended federal rent-control laws — the only protection against exorbitant rents for millions of families ...") but is also a valuable anachronism, a historian who rejects the academic penchant for history "with the politics left out." These historians consider it elitist and anti-democratic to focus on event-making individuals; they deny that a pre-eminent few have disproportionate impact on the destinies of the many; they present political events as "epiphenomena," reflections of social "structures" and results of impersonal forces. Caro's event-making Johnson is a very personal force.

For years and years depraved drug dealers and conscienceless hit men and crooked politicians lighted up our TV screens on "Homicide." Where was it set? Baltimore. Then came "The Wire," which some people have described as the greatest TV show ever. In it, the city that serves as a backdrop for the drama is portrayed as an open sewer, a city that is coming apart at the seams. The city in question? You guessed it. Baltimore.

In response, manager Ron Washington has moved Cruz to No. 6, and he's backed by Mike Napoli, whose .380-some average was the second highest in the majors after the break.

Jim Ruvolo, a former Ohio Democratic Party chairman, said the new districts are "the most blatant gerrymandering" he's ever seen and predicted that Democrats would move for a referendum to put the plan before voters.
These days, though, Santas are having to use it less and less.
According to the Daily Review article: "The crowd stood transfixed with horror for it believed the occupants of the automobile would not see the train."
Whether because it lies in the shadow of Mexico City, or because so little tourism information is available in (comprehensible) English, or for some other mysterious reason, foreign tourists tend to overlook Puebla in droves. Now is an ideal time to get acquainted with this colonial beauty — the home of Talavera tile, origin of some of Mexico's most famous cuisine, site of the battle commemorated by Cinco de Mayo, and beneficiary of one of the most dramatic backdrops imaginable — Mexico's iconic twin volcanoes, simmering Popocatepetl and slumbering Iztaccihuatl.

Lee was also fantastic against the Blue Jays last season, throwing 17 scoreless innings over two starts.

Adkins' brother reported him missing on July 7.

Close to home is the Sugarcreek Ohio Amish Ponzi scheme. This is the case much in the news these days of Monroe Beachy, a 77 year-old Amish man accused of running a Madoff-like Ponzi scheme. He is charged with defrauding 2,698 people out of $16.8 million over two decades. No one imagines this could happen in an Amish community. This means it could happen anywhere.

Among the signs and banners were quotes by Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, warning about the "tyranny" of government.
I was wrong — about Tanya Juarez. When Gov. Charlie Crist appointed Juarez to the Orlando-Orange County Expressway Authority, I ripped him for it. Juarez, after all, was a registered lobbyist (which was the last thing this steeped-in-politics board needed). I still think we need more public watchdogs than political insiders on government boards. But Juarez proved you can't judge a book by its cover. She ended up being the only member of this beleaguered, business-as-usual agency to regularly stand up for toll-payers, question the status quo and challenge Mayor Rich Crotty and the "culture of corruption." And I know many toll-payers who are grateful she did.
The Illuminati, a citrusy version of a traditional Gin and Tonic, takes advantage of the black lights at the bar and gives the drinker something of a bonus — it glows. Quinine in the tonic water has a fluorescent effect (The More You Know), so the more tonic, the brighter the glow.

It’s amazing technology.”
The low rates have done little to boost the struggling housing market. Rates have been below 5 percent for all but two weeks in the past year. Yet few people can qualify for the rates and many of those who can have already done so.
Saric, a 6-foot-10 forward, participated in the 2011 Nike Hoop Summit where he shot 3-for-6, scoring 7 points and grabbing 6 rebounds in 15 minutes of play. Building off of his experience from last year's game, he looked very comfortable during Monday's scrimmage with the 2012 World Select Team. Saric had no trouble shooting the ball from the perimeter, where he made shots both off the dribble and on catch-and-shoot attempts. He ran the floor especially well for a forward of his size and also managed to show off his improved defensive game when he tipped a pass to himself out top for a steal and a breakaway dunk.

Bud is one of the heroes of the episode, convincing Arnold to step up and identify Sal as the killer he saw at the construction site.

Harang gave up a leadoff single to Cameron Maybin before striking out the next nine San Diego Padres hitters, breaking Johnny Podres' club record of eight in a row set against the Philadelphia Phillies on July 2, 1962. Harang's streak ended when Will Venable homered leading off the fourth.

I understand being selected as honorable mention All-Ohio is a wonderful accomplishment and I don’t mean to demean that level of notoriety.

Tuscan steak ($17) was one of the standouts, slices of grilled flank steak molded into the "roof" of a rustic country house whose main body consisted of interlocking crisp rectangles of potato.

The Vietnamese, who love myths and imagine animals, fairies and gods in natural settings, have names for many of the formations. The Singapore Lion that looms above is breathtaking. The Pagoda is an enchanting limestone look-alike. Indeed, Le, one of our traveling companions, described the cave as a religious experience, exclaiming it's the most beautiful place he'd ever been. For me, it brought the same feelings of awe as when I first peered into the Grand Canyon.
All these developments presented Romney with chances to remind the nation that this is not the election that ends with a cloud of white smoke over the Sistine Chapel. What did he do instead? He doubled down on his efforts to reach the party's religious base, telling a Michigan crowd: "Unfortunately, possibly because of the people the president hangs around with, and their agenda, their secular agenda -- they have fought against religion." And in the CNN debate in Arizona, he accused Obama of an "attack on religious conscience."

My point is this: A human can be dangerous to other humans when improperly raised. Should all humans be declared "inherently dangerous?" History is replete with violence and murder between human beings. Have you read the news today? Wouldn't it make sense then to destroy the human race and put an end to all the violence? That's ridiculous! And so is the death sentence that the Maryland Court of Appeals has brought upon the entire pit bull breed with its callous ruling. At the risk of losing everything they own in a lawsuit, what dog owner in their right mind will now be willing to keep a pit bull on their premises? The shelters will become overrun with pit bulls and, sadly, they will inevitably be forced to euthanize these beautiful animals. Meanwhile, the dog-fighting thugs who are responsible for the lion's share of pit bull abuse and neglect will continue to carry on underground.

July 2011: "Republicans are determined to avoid insolvency -- the point at which we can no longer pay all our bills. The only way to do that in the long run is to scale down spending.

“The two bands are sonically pretty different,” says Swanson. “But there is an underlying theme of roots-to-R&B sound and real raunchy rock ‘n’ roll. The Faces in the ‘70s were probably the ultimate gritty rock n roll band of the era. With no disrespect to the Stones, the Faces were a more powerful band. It’s easy to forget, but Rod Stewart was really a powerhouse vocalist back then and the rest of the band just laid out this amazing groove for him to carry over. “

During his first offseason as a professional, Hosmer developed a routine. He lived on a beachfront property in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., with his older brother, Mikey, and another friend from back home, Bryan Clancy. On most mornings, he would run two miles in the sand, a convenient way to maintain his leg strength during the winter months. Sometimes, Hosmer would sit on the couch with his brother and use Apple TV to re-watch games from the previous season. Most of the time, Mikey says, Hosmer would be zeroing in on a certain pitcher or team. What did the pitcher throw in that count? What does this guy have?

After three days of arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court, the case for the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, better known as "Obamacare," remains strong. Four members of the court, including the justice expected to be the key swing vote on the issue, asked tough questions of the government's lawyer about the requirement that individuals obtain health insurance that is at the heart of the case against the law. But the inaptness of the comparisons they used to call the individual mandate into question reveal the uniqueness of the health insurance market and the propriety of Congress' decision to regulate it in the way it did. And even as the justices questioned whether Congress overstepped its powers, they risked doing the same.

Thomas writes that "Unbelievably, the active listing inventory shed an additional 261 homes in the past two weeks, totaling 6,354, levels not seen since June 2005. If you recall, both 2004 and 2005 were nuts with very little inventory and scorching demand. Ask any real estate professional that experienced that market how the activity today compares and they will quickly state that it is not much different. Lower prices and plenty of distressed properties are the big differences. To date in 2012, the inventory has dropped by 1,760 homes, a 22 percent drop. The unabated drop actually began back in July 2011. Compared to this time last year, there are 42 percent fewer homes on the market. There are 31 percent fewer than 2010. In some ranges, the year over year differences is stunning. There are 51 percent fewer homes on the market priced below $500,000. Even the upper ranges are experiencing tighter inventory with 20 percent fewer homes on the market for all homes priced above $1 million. The low levels look like they are here to stay."

"The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find." And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. (22:8-10)

That the dextrous Clark is a latter-day electric guitar hero is also well known. Whatever her marketing people want to call it, "Strange Mercy" is a prog-rock album -- there are echoes of Howe, Fripp, Wakeman, Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush all over this disc. But a big difference between "Strange Mercy" and the two discs that preceded it is that the arrangements, as imaginative as they are, don't make the songs. Clark can strip all of them back to acoustic guitar and voice, and they all still work. Here's a clip of Clark doing just that: sitting in a studio and strumming her way through "Year of the Tiger," my favorite song from "Strange Mercy." There's too much fret noise and Clark does not look thrilled with her performance. It doesn't matter. This version is, in its quiet way, just as intense as the one on the Poll-winning album.

Artwork-decorated restaurant, run by culinary students, that tries to separate itself from the crowded pack with a menu in colorful (if not corny) prose. The creamy bean soup is a "celestial selection of whole or blended white beans travel stroking through a sea of vegetable broth."

Alicia tells Christina that everyone is voting for Tarzan. Actually, everybody is telling Monica and Christina that it will be Tarzan.

The kebab, in this case, is misnamed. It is not skewered ground meat but slices of spit-roasted lamb, like those in a gyro. Adana (a food-obsessed city in Turkey) consists of pressed pieces of skewered chicken. The highly seasoned eats in both dishes, which come with or without tart yogurt sauce, have a pleasing crustiness. And the stuffed eggplant with lamb is their equal. The restaurant's appetizers are nearly all meatless, and two or three would make a meal. And the house-made desserts are worth the calories. -- David Farkas, Special to The Plain Dealer

I've asked Will about his penchant for stripping, and he really doesn't have an answer. However, he credits being raised in Irvine for his particular brand of comedy.

"I heard a rumor that he's possibly coming back. I don't know. I forgive and forget. Also, I have a really bad memory, I used to fall down a lot. He gave it a long try and it didn't work out. If he is looking to come back, I think he went about leaving the wrong way if he is looking to come back to this town. Even though we are more than happy to do well and have a hometown kid, when you kind of kick us in the crotch and leave town, it's hard to come back in. We are also very forgiving because for 25 years we sat through Browns games and always stood by them. I'm sure we will give him a second chance.
