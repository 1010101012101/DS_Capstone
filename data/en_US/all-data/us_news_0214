Other compromises have been reached over the years. A century-old tunnel to the Shakespeare Garden will be replicated. Removed trees will be replaced and more added. Bike advocates are anticipating more bike friendly lanes, although they are appearing too slowly for their taste. And longtime garage opponent Stephen Willis of Save Golden Gate Park even hopes that the concourse authority will agree to keep the southern entrance shut except for big events.
Throughout this season, Mizzou has lived a lonely existence. Since the announcement that the Tigers would be leaving the conference, they have been the lamest of ducks. Made to survive on an island after other Big 12 programs distanced themselves, bad luck struck, and Alden's decisions were questioned and occasionally condemned.

Special teams in football are as stopwatch-and-measurement geeky as track and field. A 15-yard snap should reach the punter's hands in 0.8 of a second. McGee is about 4 feet closer to the long snapper, counting the distance from his heels to his toes, so the snap to him at the same velocity would take 0.73 of second. Sure, 0.07 seconds might not seem like much, but every little bit of time saved helps in a discipline in which the ball is supposed to be in the air, snap to thump, in a total of 2.0-to-2.1 seconds. (Yes, the original column had different numbers, but we're not talking a math major here.)
"I talked to many members of our community and to my family," Pillutla said, "and every time I talk to people about the project, I tell them one thing: It's not about Gary. It's not about Shawne. It's about you and me. In our lives, surely there is one incident or one person we still have to forgive. And I'm suggesting to people that they please go ahead and do it today."

It is a great opportunity for me both professionally and personally. I told them when I accepted the position that I could not even begin to try to replace Denny Graeser. I'll be who I am, and I certainly have a lot of passion when it comes to athletics."

Funds raised at Relay for Life events help fund cancer research, along with support programs such as the American Cancer Society's 24-hour cancer hotline (800-227-2345); Road to Recovery, which pays for transportation for cancer patients who could not otherwise get to life-saving appointments; and the Hope Lodge, a facility near the Mayo Clinic in north Phoenix that offers free lodging to cancer patients and their caregivers.
The school, which launched its Abu Dhabi executive M.B.A. program in 2010, now has a 14-story building in the city—including a restaurant, library and prayer rooms—but just four resident professors and 30 executive M.B.A. students. Its nondegree executive-education courses have about 1,000 participants this academic year, about one-third the size of its Singapore program and one-fifth the figure in Fontainebleau.
That's when Mack responded with his big 3 that propelled Butler to its latest upset. It helped make up nicely for the Pittsburgh game, when his late foul nearly cost Butler a chance to move on.

Community mental health centers are the latest trend in Medicare fraud, which has developed more complex schemes over the years, moving from medical equipment and HIV infusion fraud to ambulance scams, as crooks try to stay one step ahead of authorities. The scams have also grown more sophisticated using patient recruiters who are paid kickbacks for recruiting patients, while doctors, nurses and company owners coordinate to make it appear they are delivering medical services which they are not.
Hey, Hoynsie: I heard the Cardinals and Albert Pujols are pretty far apart on a new contract. Any chance the Indians make a play for him? As I write this I'm laughing hysterically, but also crying a little bit as well. You gotta laugh Hoynsie, you gotta laugh. -- Mark Cesarik, Chicago
Not just the logo, everything else looks familiar too. The Roman red walls. The milky glass light fixtures. The bare wood tables. The pounding rock music track. And the brown paper place mats printed with Italian cartoons or diagrams of office products in Italian. The menu itself is virtually identical to that of the original locale, which is what we all were hoping, isn't it?
Ahmad Bradshaw was hoping he'd be back for Monday's game against the New Orleans Saints. Instead, the Giants' running back has been ruled out and will miss his fourth straight game with a stress fracture in his right foot.
Tristan Thompson finished with 13 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavs. Jamison, a free-agent-to-be who already announced he was finished in Cleveland, made 4 of 18 shots for 12 points, and Parker, almost certain to retire, had 4 points as the Cavs finished the lockout-shortened season, 21-45, and now await their fate in the upcoming lottery and draft.
The Constitution left anything not specifically reserved to the federal government to the states. If the Supreme Court and political conservatives continue in their "strict interpretation" of the Constitution, our federal government will not be able to operate in the 21st century, and we will rapidly return to an 18th century environment. If we think we are in trouble now, imagine the U.S. having the governance of today's average Middle Eastern country.
Both parties now say they have resolved the dispute.
Verlander didnt let the Mariners get closer. After he allowed four hits in the third, he allowed one hit in his remaining three innings. Then he paused for that talk with Knight.

But the same study found that NBA referees tend to favor home teams, teams trailing in a game and teams trailing in a playoff series.
Van Patten learned the exercise, called Task, two years ago when she attended the Art21 Educators Initiative in New York City with two fellow Hillsboro High art teachers. The conference "totally shifted" the way they teach their classes, she said. Instead of focusing on the finished piece of art, and whether it is "good" or not, Art21 emphasizes the journey the artist takes in creating it -- and what he or she learns along the way.

Apple said Monday that it would begin paying a quarterly dividend of $2.65 per share starting this summer after years of resisting the idea. Its late former CEO, Steve Jobs, always thought the company could make better use of its cash.
S Antrel Rolle. This isn’t about his coverage on Pats WR Wes Welker. This is about swag and crunk(ness?). Last week, people on and around the team and its players were deathly afraid to talk. I had interviews turned down I thought would be slam dunks: Jerry Reese, Ernie Accorsi and Archie Manning were among them. The reason, I believe in part, was the opponent. But Rolle, who as we all know by now is a “cocky (guy),” set the tone by saying he and his teammates aren’t scared. He wasn’t out of line and he didn’t say anything controversial. He just showed some guts and I believe it had a major impact. “I take my hat off to this team,” he said. And quite a sweet paperboy-style hat it was, too. Bonus points for style.
"We're doing good. Everybody's working together.

Batson and chef de cuisine Caleb Jones have a true talent for balancing bold flavors. From start to finish, the kitchen hits the right notes. Baby greens in green goddess dressing ($8/$12) is enhanced with thin slices of English cucumbers and a palate wake-up call from pickled green onions. A romaine salad with fennel, grapefruit, hazelnuts and pecorino cheese ($8/$12) is set off by a lightly sweet Banyuls vinaigrette.
Why sweat the small stuff? Because most of us burn fewer calories when we're exercising than we burn just going about our ordinary daily business, says Dr. James Levine, whose research at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., first revealed this counterintuitive fact and led to his invention of the Gruve. This is true even for people who exercise religiously, not just the slugs.

"Run 'em," Miller said. "Go out and run 'em and get them out of the game early. That was our goal when I was here, and that's what happened to us in the second half. We got a little loose with the ball at the wrong times, and they just made shots."

Excerpt: At about 6:20 p.m. Tuesday, Oregon's office of public records released two e-mails from consultant Lyles to Josh Gibson, an employee on Oregon's football staff: one sent Feb. 17 and one sent March 3.

While other Pearl District eateries have come and gone, the Paragon has survived. One reason could be the cheesy deliciousness of the restaurant's grilled cheese. The lunch menu staple is a favorite seven days a week, and for good reason. Sharp and white cheddars are intermingled between two thick slices of rustic, chewy Grand Central Bakery bread, then grilled to the perfect point: The crust remains crunchy while the interior gets melty and soft. It's slightly greasy but as warm and inviting as the fireplace in the restaurant. It's served with a passable tomato soup -- the sandwich makes the soup better, rather than the other way around -- and a small mixed green salad ($9.50).

Unless you’re Kim Kardashian, dipping yourself in $10 million worth of Lorraine Schwartz diamond jewelry may be outside your realm of possibilities. Instead, opt for a single piece of jewelry to polish your look.

As shale exploration for oil and natural gas deposits takes off in a big way in Ohio, the disposal wells are needed more than ever.

Our slavish, mindless self-subordination to "international legitimacy" does nothing but allow Russia – a pretend post-Soviet superpower – to extend a protective umbrella over whichever murderous client it chooses. Obama has all but announced that Russia (or China) has merely to veto international actions – sanctions, military assistance, direct intervention – and the U.S. will back off.

Voters in Cuyahoga County like to elect judges with familiar names. But thanks to the efforts of four bar groups that evaluate judicial candidates as the Judge4Yourself.com coalition, that habit is changing. Last November, two-term Common Pleas Judge Bridget McCafferty was defeated, though her indictment on federal corruption charges -- she was subsequently convicted--probably mattered more than her lousy grades from lawyers or editorial writers.

The Times' editorial board looked at Santorum's comments about the Kennedy speech in isolation because they were emblematic of a more broadly held view among Christian conservatives.

Wine and goat cheese have a long history together. Your tasting should start with the mildest cheese and progress to the strongest. Fresh chevre, typically soft, white and tangy, is often paired with dry whites like sauvignon blanc and Sancerre, and with light-to-medium-bodied reds like Merlots and French country reds. Aged chevre, typically dry, rich and intense, can take on classic heavy reds like Cabernet Sauvignon.
Depth chart notes: Backup right guard Corey Linsley, who ran with the second team all camp, is not listed on the depth chart. A source said Linsley is suspended for the first two games. With left tackle Mike Adams already suspended five games, that leaves the offensive line even thinner. The second team includes three true freshmen and two walk-ons. ... Jordan Hall is listed as the starting running back, with Carlos Hyde or Rod Smith as the backup. That indicates that the hamstring that bothered Jaamal Berry through the end of camp won't let him play yet. Berry, expected to be a top kick returner, also isn't listed on the special teams. ...

But experts advise that you must first remove the original soil and lay a well-compacted base. If you cut corners and lay the pavers on typical Arizona clay, the ground may swell when it rains, and the pavers may pop out.
We still do retraining, but since the recession you have a lot of really highly skilled people who are out of work. They have good work histories and skills. It wasn't a matter of training at this point.We feel our No. 1 priority right now is to find the open positions that are out there in the field and to find qualified people and get them in front of employers as quickly as possible.We feel very strongly about the strong skills of the workforce. They have the skills to be working; and they should be working.

But attorneys for St. Stanislaus sought to play down the significance of the Serbian case.

Sacramento will eventually require a dam to guard against floods, Doolittle said. But without water rights, the federal government would be limited to building a "dry" dam -- a concrete wall with a big hole in it to let the American River flow unimpeded most of the time and hold back water temporarily only in the event of a gigantic flood.
Amaryllis and paperwhite bulbs make a thoughtful little holiday gift for winter-stranded gardeners, but if none came your way, there’s still time to order and plant some. There are just a few variations on the paperwhite theme — white, yellow or bicolors — but the choices in amaryllis are expansive and include a wide array of vivid colors and refined flower forms.

How much more powerful would this novel be if all these witnesses had nothing going on except the moral darkness of apathy? How much more powerful if they didn't care or didn't want to get caught up in it, if it were a matter of the bleakness of their souls? That's what made the Genovese case so powerful in the first place, and it's what continues to draw us to it even now.

Maybe it's coincidence, but Grigson followed a blueprint the Colts utilized when they took quarterbacks first overall in 1990 (Jeff George) and '98 (Peyton Manning). Those are the only other times since the 1970 merger that the Colts used their first four draft picks on offensive players.

Nelson, who married Floyd Pond in 2009 in Volusia County, had done nothing wrong or shameful. She had simply landed in the most fickle of professions - television news - in which a job evaluation often bears no relation to job performance. She was a pro's pro who as co-anchor had helped take WFTV-Channel 9 news to the top of the ratings in the mid-1980s. The station never said why she was fired, but she suspects it was because consultants found her persona abrasive and too dominant for her male co-anchors.

Asked to name his accomplishments, the president pointed out the school-tuition program, to be paid for with a tax on incoming international phone calls, as well as the clearing of major camps, largely achieved through rental subsidies, the repair of damaged homes and, most controversially, outright evictions from the flimsy shelters of the overcrowded temporary settlements.

With all that we know about what's gone wrong in Iraq, even today's debate is divorced from reality. We've got a surge that is somehow declared a success even though it has failed to enable the political reconciliation that was its stated purpose. The fact that violence today is only as horrific as in 2006 is held up as progress. Washington politicians and pundits trip over each other to debate a newspaper advertisement while our troops fight and die in Iraq.

From LAX, British, United, Lufthansa and KLM offer connecting service to Edinburgh. Restricted round-trip fares begin at $1,241, including taxes and fees. From Edinburgh, take the train to nearby North Queensferry, where the Fife Coastal Path begins. The path runs about 93 miles, from North Queensferry to Dundee, Scotland’s fourth-largest city. It can be walked in seven days or less — if you’re fit and driven. But it’s more enjoyable to allow extra time, so you can take rest days and explore historic towns such as St. Andrews (with its celebrated golf course and the oldest university in Scotland), castle ruins, ancient churchyards such as St. Bridget’s near Aberdour and the fishing villages between Elie and Crail.

Environmental critics say the recommendation lowballs pollution controls and unnecessarily extends the life of Oregon's dirtiest plant. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, by contrast, says it sets a precedent of regulating the nation's low-cost coal plants out of business.
Since 2009, at the city attorney's direction, the Police Bureau no longer tows vehicles of people arrested on charges of drunken driving, driving without a valid license or other offenses unless the car, as parked, poses a traffic hazard or the driver lacks insurance. Over the past three years, tow revenue has dropped from $2.6 million to $200,000. The change in towing practices stems from a federal court of appeals ruling in a case that originated in another municipality.
Owendoff is relatively new to Portland -- he took the job at CB Richard Ellis a year ago -- and he's worked hard to raise his profile and rub shoulders with the right people. But as he was accepting Adams' appointment to planning task forces and generally playing the role of civic leader, he was, in his off hours, slashing at other leaders on the Internet.

Beachwood High Scool Principal Bob Hardis sent a note home to parents in the image-conscious district to say that Newsweek never contacted Beachwood to submit data, a confusion caused because the reporter who had done the ranking for years is now doing them for the Washington Post.

Among the students enrolled in Crowder's alternative energy program is Edwin Moore, a freelance writer from nearby Anderson. Like many students in the program, Moore sees it both as an opportunity to learn something that could help him in his current job and something that could lead elsewhere.
There's no reason to think that Bishop is trying to constitutionalize nullification (or, as it was earlier known, interposition). He has other aims in mind, and he may never have considered his amendment's relationship to the past. But what he's seeking carries with it a heavy burden of historical failure and contempt. It also suggests that he's not confident of the ability of his party or his policies to gain legislative majorities in their favor by congressional action.

Treatment focuses on keeping the cat comfortable and maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance.
With the exception of one (accidentally strenuous) hike, we spent most of our days lying on the beach. The approach is not encouraging — a quarter-mile path down a scrubby hill — but the reward is a stretch of soft white sand and placid, jewel-colored water. The sea is cool enough to be refreshing but warm enough that even a temperature wimp like me can walk right in. On either side are rocky coves, with smooth gray boulders that look as if they have been placed specifically for a high-fashion shoot. At sunset, the sand begins to glow hot pink, a result of crushed pink shells that have washed ashore. Lounge chairs are available for about $7 per day, but never once did anyone come by to collect money. (The Greeks, not the Germans, are clearly in charge of the waterfront.)

Carlson has yet to garner a single criminal conviction -- not even a speeding ticket, state court records show.

Largemouth bass fishing has been good all around the area. Bass are being caught at Wingfoot Lake on Carolina rigs tipped with soft plastic baits, spinnerbaits cast along the shoreline, lead-head jigs pitched to shoreline timber and 10-inch plastic worms. Also good for largemouth bass are Wellington Upground Reservoir and Pymatuning Lake, where both largemouth and smallmouth bass are being caught.
Perhaps an age average that crept into the mid-60s was to blame, but the audience had to repeatedly be goaded to "clap your hands" or "get on your feet." Only during the "Hey Jude" finale and a full-chorus sing-a-long of "Na-na-na-nanana" did the show resemble a real-live concert.

GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) — Celtic manager Neil Lennon has been banned from the touchline for three matches after he confronted the referee following his team's Scottish Cup semifinal defeat to Hearts last month.
Response: The way Glassboro currently spends money is secretive and unaccountable to the taxpayers. I propose a thorough and open examination of the borough budget and financial policies to allow the taxpayers to finally see exactly where their money is going. I want to end the closed council sessions, the creative no-bid contracting that hides the pay-to-play and the back-scratching that goes on in the borough, and, use the savings to lower the tax burden in the borough. I have experience managing budgets and operations in a Fortune 500 company, and that experience will give me the skills needed to make the hard decisions that are required to ensure a better tomorrow. When elected, I will not accept the council person salary.

One of the recipients was Nancy Zuchinski, a former school bus driver. She appreciated their hard work, including filling five trash bags with yard waste. Zuchinski said she will remember their energy and service all summer when she looks at the petunias they planted for her.
Opener Jarrell is a fetching pop kid with some seriously infectious material: “Catch Me If You Can” and “Almost Love” sound like early Paula Abdul, or maybe Beyonce after five bowls of Cap’n Crunch. Unfortunately, Jarrell’s mini-set was nowhere near as compelling as her records are. Jarrell chose to play without a band, appearing instead with two dancers. She did bother to sing her songs, sort of, but far too much of her lead vox was piped in. I realize that Jarrell didn’t want to interrupt her dance routines, but this struck me as a poor job of role modeling for the kids. I know everybody wants to be an American Idol, and that’s cool. But we need to develop some young instrumentalists, too.

Stuff happens. Darrell Arthur won a national championship under Self at Kansas, but his Dallas high school had to forfeit two state championships because of a grade-changing scandal that Arthur reportedly benefited from.

Boxer was unable to enact climate-change legislation when Democrats held a filibuster-proof Senate majority, but she has proven adept at blocking legislation.

They enjoyed his skewering of the news media, though arguably he enjoyed the give-and-take with reporters more than any current GOP candidate.

To underscore the Marine factor -- "he has never failed to answer the call when his community or country needed him" -- Cutler perhaps unintentionally acknowledges that Mandel was not the GOP's first choice for the Senate race.

One of my most vivid memories of her is on the highway, driving her two daughters, my sister and me north from Richmond one summer after we had visited camp friends there.

The talent doesn’t end there, either. Kasza’s sophomore brother Piotr is the team’s second-year starting setter and has gained polish. Ricky Myint was an all-city caliber libero last year, but has moved over – for the time being – to the other outside hitter spot. Yang said he could return to libero if he isn’t completely pleased with the team’s defense.

Oh, and being kids, they absolutely HAD to figure out what kind of rock skips best (shale) and how many skips a good arm could get out of it (six). Three rangers (well, Cindy and Jeff for real, plus me in my ranger suit) and two interns kept the kids out of the water. Mostly, anyway. But it wasn't easy. Especially since I can now admit I wanted to traipse through the river with 'em.

To illustrate the bull's-eye that is affixed to a World Series champion starting the next season, 47 times in the last 90 years the previous year's champion has lost or split its opening series the next year. That includes the mighty Yankees, who have won 27 World Series titles, failing to win the first series the next year 13 times. But that percentage actually is good.

None pretends it has found a universal secret to success. What their leaders have learned is that fiscal prudence, coupled with a willingness to take risks and choose among unpalatable alternatives, has positioned their businesses for hard times.

iPAD SALES: Apple sold 11.8 million iPads in the quarter, the one area of Tuesday's earnings announcement that could be seen as disappointing. The Cupertino company launched a new model of the device this quarter, which usually means a bigger bounce in sales than Apple showed. The total represented a 22.4 percent drop from the holiday shopping quarter, and many analysts were expecting the company to sell more than 12 million iPads in the quarter. Still, Apple increased iPad sales 151 percent from the same quarter of 2011, and CEO Tim Cook seemed pleased with the result. "The new iPad is off to a great start, and across the year you're going to see a lot more of the kind of innovation that only Apple can deliver," he said in the news release.

Part of what kept them earthbound was the necessity of establishing the characters and relationships that would last for a projected seven-movie series. In the first film, the lengthy introductions to apprentice wizard Harry, his schoolmates Ron and Hermione, his teachers, his adversaries and the various mythical beasts that loiter at the Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft separated the true believers from the moviegoing Muggles. In the second film, those of us who weren't chilled to the bone by the very mention of the Dark Lord Voldemort were locked in the dungeon while the (mostly young) fan base feasted on minutia. It didn't help win many new converts that the cook was ham-fisted junk-food director Chris Columbus ("Home Alone"). But J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter books and the overlord of the movie adaptations, ordered a new menu for the third course. She approved the hiring of Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron ("Y Tu Mama Tambien") and empowered him to trim the fat. "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is not only the shortest of the films, it is easily the best. Cuaron has injected it with both a new energy and a trippier vibe, which may be darker than the kiddies expect but is appropriate for the onset of the hero's adolescence.
Regardless, the Park Service already has started considering its decision, said Green, the superintendent. "I think we owe it to the wolves," she said. "And the researchers."

Around the same time as the realignment, the University of Southern California, home of one of the premier college football programs, suffered a major embarrassment when Reggie Bush, who starred at tailback for the Trojans in the mid-2000s, was found to have received lavish gifts from a sports marketer. According to the NCAA, Bush was, in effect, a pro while he was in college, and the university knew it. The NCAA concluded that USC demonstrated a “lack of institutional control” over its football program. The team received a two-year postseason ban, lost 30 scholarships over three seasons and vacated its victories from the period when Bush was deemed to have been ineligible — including the 2004 national championship season.

(On deciding to put Brandon Jackson on injured reserve and if eight weeks was too long to wait)- "That was really tough. He's a great kid and we think he's a really good player. It's just at that position, it's tough to do. You just can't find a roster spot to keep him. You're going to have three running backs most of the time, so really you'd end up keeping four running backs with him. We're thinking more long term with Brandon. We like him, we have him under contract for a few more years. We didn't want to get into a situation where we had to force the issue. If one of our two guys got hurt or nicked up we'd have to do something else then we would probably had to shelve him anyways. It's going to be a little bit of time, there's no surgery involved, but it's going to be a while before he's able to do anything."

Then continue, and in no time you'll be in San Blas, a hillside barrio that spills down to the plaza and where global visitors mingle with Cuzco's artistic types. Grab a snack at the tiny, orange-walled Café de Mama Oli (199 Plazoleta Nazarenas), and peek at the lobby of the Hotel Monasterio, where rates routinely run $400 and up a night. This old monastery, built in the 1590s, was converted 47 years ago into a lodging with two courtyards and museum-worthy art. (If you go in March, stay three nights and pay upfront, you can get rooms here for as little as $235.) Then have a look at the Amaru Hostal, a block away, with pleasant, modest rooms for about $50 a night. (I wish I'd slept there instead of at the Andina Classic Cuzco Plaza, where I paid about $140 for a tiny room.)

Visitors to Tampa inevitably will hear that the city's best entertainment strip is in Ybor City, a historic district just northeast of downtown. Like the more well-known French Quarter, Ybor's brick streets and New Orleans style balconies ooze with charm and a sense of history.

It is with sorrow that we bid her farewell one last time. But it seems somehow part of her impeccable timing that we do so in the week the Oregon Legislature opens its spring assembly. And the issues our legislators will take up would be so familiar to Jeannette Hamby: Health care of decent quality and affordable to all; education that begins pre-K and prepares our kids through college to take up their rightful place in living and building the American Dream; how to finance rural counties using the natural resources of our beautiful land (read “forestry”) while at the same time preserving those resources for future generations; and how to grow an economy with jobs that provide parents the means to feed, clothe, house and educate their families with dignity.

Maybe you have an older dog with arthritis. Getting pounced on by a young child could hurt, causing the dog to snap. Dogs may also lash out in response to rough or even mean-spirited behavior from children, like spitting or wrestling. If a dog pants for no reason or won't lean into a child for a hug, that could be a sign that the dog feels stressed by the child's presence, Yin said.

Dear Carolyn: According to advice you've given others, my boyfriend should have left me long ago. I'm very prone to seeing the negative side of things, except when I give advice to others. I'm deeply uncomfortable with him going out and drinking because a small voice in the back of my head insists he will cheat.

I have gotten better, but still have very far to go. Result being he doesn't always get treated as he deserves. Should I leave him, so he can find someone better? I know he won't leave me; he's even told me he figured out how he wants to propose.

For the rest of this year, this editorial page will spotlight these successes and try to spark the conversations about how to build on them and turn these small points of light into powerful beacons. We will cheer, cajole and sometimes criticize -- but always with the ultimate goal of banishing Eeyore from the lexicon and mindsets of those who live here.

Mantle was clearly coming to the end of an illustrious career in the late 1960s. He had been moved from center field to first base in 1967 because his knees just could no longer manage the outfield. After a disastrous stretch from 1965 to 1967 (where the team finished 6th, 9th and 10th), the Yankees had improved in 1968 to get back over .500 and Mantle, even in his diminished state, was still a major part of the Yankees offense (not to mention the fact that he was far and away their most marketable player). Advanced statistics were not in vogue at the time, so much was made about Mantle's low batting averages in 1967 and 1968 (.245 and .237, respectively). Mantle, himself, was disgusted that his .237 batting average in 1968 actually pulled his career batting average under .300. However, Mantle was still the Yankees' leading home run hitter, he was still in the top five in the American League in on-base percentage (OBP) and was in the top ten in the AL in on-base percentage plus slugging percentage (OPS).
