For his call of the Devils-Panthers series on MSG+. This was a masterful display of yakking by Cangialosi. His timing, his ability to enhance the drama (especially in Game 7), was hockey play-by-play at its best. Chico Resch, his partner, had a fine series, too. The p-b-p man set him up well. These voices showed balance. Unlike other local hockey broadcasters, they did not whine about penalties or spend much time questioning calls. They didn't waste words on jive. Instead, they focussed on the game. Cangialosi has huge shoes to fill replacing Doc Emrick. He's providing evidence his feet are pretty big.

Last year, you might recall, the Internal Revenue Service did not mail tax instructions and returns. The same holds true this year. It's a permanent cost-savings measure.

Albert Pujols is a competitor at the highest level and obviously loves to play baseball. His performance speaks for itself. No one can legitimately complain about how much money ballplayers are paid. The owners collectively set the salaries. No one points a gun at their heads.
That recommendation comes from Butcher himself, but the acclaimed Orlando singer-songwriter has news to back it up: His CD-release show on July 9 at the Plaza Theatre will be more than a celebration of his fine sophomore album, "Ghostwriting."

Matheny added that there is going to be playing time awaiting Craig when he gets to the majors because Lance Berkman is still on the bench with a calf strain.

We shared the grilled vegetable salad ($9.99) and pesto pizza ($7.99). The salad was a healthful yet appetizing mix of warm, crisp broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, yellow squash, mushrooms, tomato, garlic and ginger.

For many, the student loan burden is crippling. If they can't find work, they can defer payment on their loans, but interest keeps adding up on the unpaid balance. If they find work, they often can't pay the basics - rent, car loan, health care and student loan. Instead of their education lifting them into the middle class, it too often suffocates hope.

"He’s never been held accountable," Fitter said of the Rev. John Capparelli, the man who allegedly groped him repeatedly in the early 1980s. "Without a change in the law, people like me will never be able to truly seek justice and expose pedophiles like the man who abused me."

These steaks aren't cheap: A single bone-in rib-eye, for example, will cost you $26 through the ranch's website. But if you can afford wines from Leonetti Cellar and Figgins, you probably won't be bothered by the fact that a raw hunk of Lostine meat is equal in price to a steak entree at a higher-end restaurant. And anyway, competitors are even costlier: The swanky New York butcher Lobel's, for example, sells similarly sized bone-in rib-eyes online from $37 to $80 a pop.
"It does not reflect creditably on the House for the Speaker of the House to violate any federal law or House rule," it continues. "As Speaker Boehner vocally and vociferously has called for a new era of government fiscal austerity, it is even more egregious for him to have violated federal laws designed to prevent the government from overspending."

There are rumors of romance between Robin and Maid Marian (Jennie Spector), who can fend for herself with a sword, thank you very much. In fact, some very authentic-looking swordplay choreographed by fight director Kendall Wells makes this a real action entertainment.

Incumbents still rule. Marquee races produced defeat for five state House incumbents, as well as some closer-than-expected contests. These isolated races, however, almost all featured unique local conditions. The bigger picture is the huge number of incumbents who ran unopposed, or who face opposition only on the fall ballot. Altogether more than 40 percent of state House members and 20 percent of state senators face no opponents at all this year. Only eight percent of senators and 14 percent of House members were opposed in the primary. We are a long distance from the watershed 2006 anti-incumbency election in which 54 new members were elected. This year neither anger nor antipathy has morphed into a serious anti-incumbency fervor. The 95 percent reelection rate for incumbents past may not be returning yet, but we are far from enjoying truly competitive legislative elections in Pennsylvania.
OK, so maybe ultimate isn't aimed at my cheapskate demographic. On the other end of the add-on scale is a reservation for two lounge chairs and one umbrella set on a slice of sand inside Roa's Rapids (a.k.a. the crazy river). There are 24 of those sets, and they go for $20. After arriving midday last week and having to scout for an empty spot among the masses, I will consider that in the future.

Like Jackson Pollock's drip paintings and Christo and Jeanne-Claude's wrapped buildings, contemporary American artists have a reputation for making beautiful, challenging work—and, in doing so, reflecting back who we are as a nation. Since 1986 the Foundation for Art and Preservation in Embassies (FAPE), a nonprofit now led by collector and philanthropist Jo Carole Lauder, has acted as a kind of global curator for our national psyche, placing preeminent American art in consulates and embassies around the world—and allowing luminaries like Ellsworth Kelly and Louise Bourgeois to serve as our cultural ambassadors abroad.
It is disconcerting, though, that conditions appear to have gotten worse since the 2008 Kentucky Derby caused Congress to push for reform. That year, Eight Belles broke two ankles during the most-watched race in America and was euthanized. Under pressure, the broad, loosely-affiliated network of tracks and associations that makes up the horse racing industry promised congressmen and senators that there'd be reform.

Add the onions, carrots, celery, parsley, bay leaves and plum tomatoes, crushing them between your fingers as you add them. Add 1 tablespoon salt, cover partially and adjust the heat to maintain a gentle bubble. Cook 4 hours.

The Friday night concert — ostensibly to celebrate the release of “Horse Feathers and Animal Crackers,” Main Man’s two-CD collection of Queen covers — might have made more sense in February, but a blizzard forced a postponement to Memorial Day weekend.

My first visit to Johnny's Bar was memorable. Johnny's is in a past-its-prime, mixed-use neighborhood on Fulton Road on the near West Side. I had my doubts driving up. A friend had raved about Johnny's to my wife, but it looked like any rundown neighborhood bar from the outside. Stepping through the door was like entering another dimension.

It was great to recently discover that Johnny's has not slipped a bit. The menu is still dotted with many of the favorites from 20 years ago, dishes like grilled long-bone veal chop, cold-smoked filet mignon, stuffed banana peppers and a variety of pastas and seafood specialties.

The main lobbying organization for the Indian-American community, USINPAC, cites the Tata deal as one of Clinton's top three achievements as a senator -- and evidence of a turnabout, in its view, from her past criticism of outsourcing.

Whatever the merits of this case, surely it is significant that it is most often made by U.S. policy analysts and government officials (as well as, to a lesser extent, by British officials). From Pax Romana through Pax Britannica to the current Pax Americana, empires have justified their own power by insisting that they were not simply serving their own interests but rather the common good.

Wells wrote that "the sprawling British Empire still maintained a tradition of free trade, equal treatment and open-handedness to all comers round and about the planet."

Perhaps more important, food stamp benefits can be more generous, especially lately thanks to the federal stimulus package of 2009. In that law, Congress raised the maximum food stamp benefit for households with three members, for example, to $526 a month, from $463, and it will stay at that level until 2014. The average American on food stamps today gets $134 per person a month. The average monthly WIC is $47. Benefits for infants under WIC are better: typically $100 for the infant and $50 for the mother.

"Back in the early 2000's, buyers zealously bought homes without regard to someday becoming sellers. Contrast that with the subsequent, unprecedented downturn, the housing market transitioned into a deep six year hibernation. The sleeping giant, housing, has awakened. The most fascinating aspect of this latest shift in the market is that absolutely nobody forecasted this major step in a housing recovery. The current statistics are staggering: Listing Inventory is at its lowest point since June 2005; Demand is at its highest level since June 2005; The expected market time is at its lowest level since June 2005; Closed sales have not been this low since October 2006 (May 2010 was at a similar level, but only temporary due to the expiration of the first time home buyer tax credit); The distressed property inventory is at lows not seen since September 2007."

Teacher Gal: Hey Gail, hope you're inside and dry today. Just curious: I caught an old episode of NCIS Los Angeles and realized that the character Nate (forensic psychologist) has vanished off the program.

Unfortunately, the orchestral devices frequently added smoothness, exactness and seriousness in areas where edginess, urgency and liveliness should've entered. Death Cab for Cutie framed somber songs in meticulous surroundings, opting for precision and delicacy that left scant opportunity for spontaneity. Tension and punchiness seldom surfaced; awakening bursts of volume and distortion were equally rare. Rather than enhance the drama, the strings caused tunes like "Bend to Squares" to plod. Gibbard and multi-instrumentalist Chris Walla engaged in back-and-forth guitar volleys only on "Cath…" and the closing "Transatlanticism," an epic blown up to even greater proportions by the dozen onstage musicians.

Those who bother to read my letters to the editor might be surprised to read that I agree with Frank's, unstated, point that name calling by either side of the political spectrum does little to further the discussion on issues important to our political debates. That being said Frank's latest pictorial column leave a few matters undiscussed. First, I would note that while Frank did mention that Ed Schultz's use of a crass word to describe Laura Ingraham resulted in his suspension from his program, no such "punishment" was visited on Limbaugh despite his repeated slanderous statements about Ms. Fluke. Second, with regard to slander and libel, the law in the United States since the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of N.Y. Times Co. v. Sullivan in 1964 has been that libel of a public official or person requires proof of "actual malice" defined as a knowing or reckless disregard for the truth. In a later case, Gertz v. Robert Welch Inc. decided in 1974, the Supreme Court established that private individuals could prove defamation caused by negligence a much lower standard than the actual malice standard in the Sullivan case. As Frank pointed out, his three conservative woman heroes are all public figures and hence statements addressed to them are defamatory only if they show actual malice. Ms. Fluke, on the other hand, a private citizen testifying about her opinions regarding insurance coverage for birth control for her health and the health of her fellow law students, could not, in any sense, be deemed to be a "public person." This makes sense since Frank's trio (and Limbaugh for that matter), have ample access to combat any statements made about them by Bill Maher, Ed Schultz or anyone else -- access not available to Ms. Fluke.

"Here in a three-week period you get a chance to see half of the year's good movies," said Alvin Easter, a UFS and film festival fan for more than 40 years.

In addition to enjoying European drama and period pieces, he's a huge fan of the festival's horror-heavy Midnight Movies sidebar.

But when news broke last month about a bill pushed by his fellow Republicans that would restrict discussion of sexual orientation in public schools  dubbed the "don't say gay" bill  Wyatt finally knew what he had to do.
But under no conditions will he give up the seat of his power. Seacrest is terrified that if anyone takes his job on "Idol," even for one night, the world will realize what a monumental fraud he has perpetrated. If his corporate masters at Fox were to see how easy that job is, how little effort it would take to replace their glorified announcer, they would immediately say, "Why are we paying this mannequin $30 million? He couldn't hold Johnny Olson's cue cards."

In my opinion, The Sun does not serve the public well by failing to question the preposterous "doomsday" threats oft repeated by Democrats and Whiner-in-Chief, Gov.Martin O'Malley. John Q.

I've always enjoyed comedy since I was a kid watching Jerry Lewis movies. And the first TV job I ever got, I auditioned for a guest spot on a TV show called "Anything But Love" with Richard Lewis and Jamie Lee Curtis, and I had a blast doing it. That led to more guest spots and then pilots and whatnot. Up until that point, I'd done a couple of awful B movies. I did have the opportunity to go to South Africa to make a couple of really bad movies. And I came back and really tinkered around a bit, doing TV commercial work. I even did a bit of print work in the early days, when I was 20 years old. Yes, I was a model for a brief time. I even did a day's worth of print work for International Male magazine. It's like a gay man's Victoria's Secret. I wasn't wearing the thong underwear, but I'd have maybe long pants on with a sweater tied around my waist and no shirt on, like that's normally how guys walk around.
On those initial albums, the pure sugar rush and whiplash energy of Mates of State was part of the joy of encountering the group’s music. Instead of structuring songs with careful introductions and verses, Gardner and Hammel simply piled chorus upon chorus. It could be incongruous, and sometimes, it meant the songs didn’t make a heck of a lot of sense. But Mates of State always gave listeners something delightful to sing along to.

They must seek treatment within a 14-day window, and only emergency medical conditions warrant the full $10,000 worth of treatment reimbursed by PIP. The law also tightens licensing requirements for medical clinics that seek to have their services paid for by PIP.

Now here's a deal that sounds appealing. But it's like petting a tiger and thinking it's a pussy cat. These hybrid products haven't been around for a while, but now they're coming around again in offerings from the investment department of major banks like Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. The pitch is simple: Get the safety of a bank-insured certificate of deposit combined with the upside of the stock market. How could you lose?

"This is the cruelty of middle age, I find: just when things have gotten good -- really, consistently good -- I have become aware that they will end," Warner wrote. "We always say 'circle,' but . . .

Years of ascension, soaring anticipation, followed by a plateau -- which is not so bad, really -- and then, no way to sugarcoat this: a rather precipitous decline."

A: The consumer protection commissioner would license producers to cultivate marijuana and distribute it within the state. At any one time, the number of licensed producers would have to be at least three and not more than 10. Producers would have to pay a nonrefundable application fee of at least $25,000 for a producer license, and licenses would have to be renewed at least every five years. Producers would have to demonstrate that they could grow pharmaceutical-grade marijuana in a secure indoor facility and also have the ability to prevent diversion or theft of the marijuana that they grow.

On Thursday we seized the moment and took the MARC train to Washington to meet my husband’s cousin and his wife there visiting children and grandchildren. We took an early train so we could browse the East Wing of the National Gallery. Hardly anyone, except another couple we knew from Baltimore, was there. Looking at colorful paintings by Andy Warhol, Mel Bochner, Matisse, Derain and French and American Impressionists brought reverie, unwinding and gradual relaxation. What a great antidote to holiday festivities looking at art is.
Perhaps as importantly, AQAP spreads its English-language message through spoken word, in the online lectures of Yemen-based, American-born preacher Anwar al-Aulaqi, who seems to serve as a sort of chief AQAP ideologue and external operations figure. It's through his vast library of YouTube videos that Mr. al-Aulaqi appears to have inspired attacks in the U.S. and U.K., including the Fort Hood, Texas, military base shootings, and the stabbing of a British parliamentarian. In contrast, AQSL labors to communicate on an increasing infrequent basis, with some recent attempts — including al-Qaida deputy leader Ayman al-Zawahiri's assessments of Middle East protests — appearing ever more disconnected from their audience. The details emerging about bin Laden's late courier and the videos of the isolated terrorist leader watching himself on television only seem to confirm this disconnect between AQSL and its followers. AQAP's statements arguably attract far more attention these days.
“It’s much lower now,” said Whelan. “The water has moved off the roadway there; the fact that the water has gone down takes the pressure off of the bridges and dams.”
LED lights also are less of a fire hazard. Unlike incandescent bulbs, they don't produce much heat. That could turn off some homeowners who use the old-fashioned bulbs as frost protectors for outdoor plants.

President Bush has mostly deferred to the president-elect on the major domestic policy questions. He has agreed to release the additional $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, funds from the financial bailout. When a package to rescue the Big Three automakers in Detroit was tied up in Congress, Bush approved a bridge loan to keep the car manufacturers afloat until Obama could take office and negotiate his own solution. There has been a level of policy coordination between the incoming and outgoing administrations that has been unprecedented given the differences in party and ideology, to say nothing of the hostility on the campaign trail (Obama's opponent in the election may have been John McCain, but he won the presidency by running against Bush).

But it was third baseman Wilson Betemit's single up the middle that proved to be the most important hit of the night, a two-out, bases-loaded, eighth-inning hit that sent the Orioles to a 7-5 win in front of an announced 21,988.
“When you’re open, you gotta take shots and you gotta shoot the ball with confidence,” McMillan said. “Some of that is being ready. If you miss a shot or two, you can’t run and hide. You’ve got to think that the next shot is going to go in and get yourself ready and shoot the ball. If you pass up shots, as some guys do, that hurt the rhythm of the play.”
My mother's name -- Vauneta Cardwell Winthrop -- is on another wall, the donor wall at the new M.H. de Young Memorial Museum. My husband and I made a modest donation to put her there.

We depend too much on food producers to catch problems, and that's too often too little, too late. Most manufacturers work hard to ensure their products are safe. But with increasing globalization, a few large companies often produce food for millions, and one unscrupulous or incompetent manufacturer can put public health at risk from coast to coast.
Lin said Sunday that he did not want to commit to a timetable for returning, noting that he's still been unable to do some of things he would need to in game situations. Monday marked four weeks since his surgery, and the team originally expected his recovery to be a six-week process.
Still, Bostock knows it's important to be out in the country. "The reason we moved out here to Sonoita isn't because we don't want to be around people," Bostock said. "It's that it's important to make wine and to be in that place where we can grow it."

The logic of out-of-school suspension is as follows: Your behavior or attitude is so out of control that we cannot properly supervise you here in a setting designed for students and staffed by numerous adults. Rather, at the end of the day, you are to leave and not return for three to 10 days. Although we don't know where you will be or how you will spend your time, we expect that when you return, your behavior or attitude will be sufficiently changed for you to meaningfully participate in our school program.

This lodging option was way out on a limb for me. I am a vacation over-planner, comfortable only when I know I'm guaranteed a good place to eat, sleep, and a way to get around. With plans to visit five locations in nine days, we wouldn't stay in any one place for more than a couple of nights. I also knew we didn't want to be bottled up in an overpriced hotel room. This lodging option began to make sense.
QFTV Chairman and President Guan Zhaoyi explained, "We had some conflicts about the script because if we change the story too much from what the Chinese know and expect, they won't be able to accept the film."

"Bandstand" gave fans a way to hear and see rock's emerging idols in a way that radio and magazines could not.
