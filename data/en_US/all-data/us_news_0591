That is why Europe will have to decide whether to centralize itself politically as well. Europeans don't want that because they know (or at least feel) that it would be to the detriment of liberty and prosperity. There is, however, a real danger that the politicians will do it anyway—behind the backs of those who elected them. And this is what bothers me most. The recent dealings in EU headquarters in Brussels—literally behind closed doors—about the aid package for Greece demonstrated that there is no democracy there. The German-French tandem made the decision on behalf of the rest of the euro-zone countries, and I am afraid this will continue.
In Oakland County, about $3 billion worth of assessment is challenged, down from about $3.9 billion at this time last year, said Deputy County Executive Robert Daddow.

But the county's losses will be less than that because the appeals are running only about 30% successful, he said.

Like most of the films from Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli, Arrietty is rendered in lyrical watercolor images that suggest both transparency and depth of focus. The animators show the translucency of an ivy leaf, veins and all, and at the same time the dense green canopy of trees casting shade on the ivy vine. In a Studio Ghibli movie, every blade of grass and flower bud has a secret life.
Of course, this caliber of trainer isn't for everyone. You have to be pretty serious to lay down almost $600 for a device that merely enhances the experience of pedaling nowhere. Then again, if cycling is your life, $600 is a small price to pay for greater stability and power.

In 2009, the BBWAA first accepted employees from the stats-based Baseball Reference and Baseball Prospectus. Those initial members will have their 10-year wait period end and be allowed to vote for the first time for the January 2019 class. And those are the first drips in a waterfall. Since 2009, the BBWAA has accepted writers from numbers-oriented sites such as Fangraphs, and this trend is not about to stop. Plus, more and more writers from traditional newspapers — many of whom have votes already — have become, at the least, numbers savvy, if not numbers-centric. That number will grow, too.

In the latter, two players compete head to head on the same screen using two remotes. However, unlocking some of these options won't mean anything until you play the mini-games with such precision that you earn medals.

The oddest thing is that after 10 minutes of waiting it WILL start. One guy advocates cutting a wire to solve the problem. While it might work, it sounds nuts. And of course, with no Saturn company any longer it's hard to get it resolved.
After 10 years, the Kahala had fallen from the ranks of the top hotels again, losing its five-diamond status with AAA. The owners decided to drop Mandarin and go independent.

Many are still reeling from the suggestion that the same women who supported Hillary Clinton would turn around and vote for a radical conservative like Palin out of - what? - spite? The notion that droves of women would shift their allegiances because any skirt will do illustrates an astonishing disregard for the collective intelligence of our gender. Not that this is anything new in politics, but, man, did they have to be so obvious?
"No more gunshots," said an unidentified woman as she hid in the facial room of Salon Meritage, whispering to the dispatcher. "People are screaming and crying."
Obama said his private meetings with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu this week carried the same message as his public pronouncements. And he implied that Israeli pressure for urgent action was not supported by the facts, saying that a decision was not necessary within the next weeks or months.
A high smoke point (420F) means this amber colored oil can handle the heat of the fry pan. But its flavor shines brightest when used raw. Which means that getting the deepest, richest sesame flavor will mean using a bit of the oil in the pan to saute, then drizzling a bit more over the finished dish.
Staffing and building new facilities for our students may seem challenging, but I see it as opportunities that many districts in Iowa do not get to experience, Kimpston said. We have great teachers and each year we go out to add to this pool of teachers that currently work in Ankeny to join our team.
It's not a particular dish you fall in love with at Cooks County — it's a sensibility. So if the roasted beets appear one week with tangerines and arugula, the next with grapefruit and avocado, and the next with a Tunisian-tinged layering of blood oranges, honey, pistachios and mint, the play of the root's mellow sweetness and the acidic sweetness of the citrus shines through. The slithery presence of twisty strozzapreti pasta anchors both a spring sauce of green garlic and chanterelles and a wintery pork Bolognese. Roast pork loin may rest on turnips, buckwheat or a bed of white-corn polenta that tastes uncannily like grits, but it is likely to come with a thick slab of grilled bacon. The grilled lamb's tongue/poached egg salad is eternal, except when it isn't. Jullapat's bread — dense loaves baked in cast-iron dutch ovens — is pretty wonderful, and you see it a lot here, usually brushed with olive oil, grilled and served with the steamed clams or the fish soup but also served plain, with good butter, as a $3 appetizer.
The Chargers obviously believe that, to win their division, they must get to Manning, if he can play. The Broncos, who did little in free agency, must be thinking Peyton is enough, and I've got news for them. It isn't. How people are predicting that the Broncos are going to win this division now is beyond me.
Shouldn't that cause some reflection in the Chaparral community?

But the approach is not for everyone (meat-and-potato types need not apply). The menu is hard to decipher and servers are more friendly souls than guides to this promised land. Dishes have no actual names, just a cryptic list of ingredients, with one dominant flavor -- like "chestnuts" or "leeks" -- highlighted in large type, but little sense of how the components are supposed to come together. You're on your own to connect the dots on your plate.

The fact that Reed is diverging from his normal offseason routine makes me nervous. This is the time of year when he usually keeps everybody guessing about his retirement plans and tries to use that as leverage in his seemingly endless contract dance with the team. That was definitely in play when he spoke of playing four or five more years at his Hall of Fame celebration at the University of Miami, but who really ever knows what Ed Reed is thinking?

Under Varney's direction, Fort Campbell is the tip of the spear for a new fight, a proving ground for suicide-prevention programs. Varney is the military's first full-time suicide-prevention program manager and Fort Campbell has created a clinic, unique in the Army, to treat, track and monitor high-risk soldiers. The clinic has hired 50 care assistants, who interview returning soldiers and direct troops to further counselling or back to their unit based on how they answer questions about their mental health. New arrivals at the fort and family members on base are given handfuls of mental health literature and enough magnetized confidential numbers to cover a refrigerator. When 270 soldiers recently returned from a yearlong deployment, the weeklong program they were required to attend mentioned suicide 23 times.
That system begat the second irony: While California's problems are often portrayed as the result of partisanship and uncompromising ideologues, this centralized system came to be defended by a fierce consensus that spans party and ideology.

Rose was still beating buzzers 24 hours after his 20-foot jumper gave the Bulls a dramatic victory in ­Milwaukee.

Republicans redrew what have been 18 Ohio congressional districts into 16. (Ohio is losing two to states whose populations are growing faster.)

"How much evidence does the president need to decide that a particular American is part of a terrorist group?" Wyden wrote. "Does the president have to provide individual Americans with an opportunity to surrender before using lethal force against them?

Can the president order intelligence agencies to kill an American who is inside the United States?"

Of course, the other end of the equation was he'd have to improve his play on the field, and he did. Umenyiora recorded 11.5 sacks last season and set an NFL record with 10 forced fumbles.

You imply that if Palestinians had packed up and abandoned their homes, fields and communities to make room for a Jewish state in Palestine, then conflict would have been avoided and much of European Jewry might have been saved.

R. Donahue Peebles, a New York-based member of the Obama campaign's national finance committee, said the Democratic Party or Obama campaign may need to pick up some of the costs—or, the party may need to drop the prohibition on corporate giving.

Destruction: Then a Soviet Republic, the small nation of Armenia was so ravaged by the earthquake, centered in Spitak, that the Soviets were forced to allow armies of foreign relief workers in to deal with the widespread devastation. Most buildings in the second- and third-largest cities in the country were gone, leaving more than 500,000 homeless in the bitter cold. Armenian youth in particular paid a terrible price: If the earthquake had struck a few minutes later, thousands of children would have survived merely by being outside of their poorly constructed schools.

Over in Monterey Park, Bollini's Pizzeria Napolitana waves the pizza flag with honor. A graduate of Le Cordon Bleu who has worked around L.A. at some top restaurants, Chris Bollini had the idea to open his own pizzeria in Monterey Park where he grew up. To do that, he went straight to Italy to apprentice in the art of la pizza. The wood-burning pizza oven is fired up at noon ready to bake any of a long list of Neapolitan-style pies. He doesn't subscribe to the dinner plate-size pizza but makes them in two sizes -- large and larger. You can buy them by the slice, too. He's got the classics and some wilder ones, like the Papo (olive pesto, shrimp, clams, tomatoes, hot peppers) or the Steak Special (marinated steak, horseradish sauce, arugula). Though his crust hits the mark, upgrading the quality of the topping ingredients would raise these pizzas to another level.

Others exact a tougher toll. If the "doomsday" budget goes into effect, state employees, who have effectively seen their pay cut by furloughs in recent years, would lose their first raise since 2008 — a 2 percent cost-of-living increase that would have only kicked in halfway through the year. They would also be forced to pay more for their health insurance. Education aid to local governments would be cut by more than $200 million — including money targeted to help the state's poorest jurisdictions. And community colleges, which are struggling as it is to cope with increased enrollment sparked by the economic downturn, would see their funds reduced by 10 percent.

"There was a girl in our group who had a notebook, and she was drawing on the cover. I asked her if I could add my art to it and she was really excited, so I added it, and then one of our porters--who did paintings in Cuzco--asked to add to it, and it just kept going around," Milillo recalls. "Then someone started playing music. And then a bunch of little kids came out."

The celebrated recording artist here sets aside lesser-known works for core repertoire, partnering with Mexico's Mineria Symphony Orchestra in elegant accounts of Beethoven's two Romances, Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1 and the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto. Between them, Quint covers in superlative fashion the spectrum of solo interaction with orchestra, from isolated guest to the lyrical essence.

A couple of days ago, Obama campaign top dog David Axelrod threw in the towel on the dog war. “I thought it was a little absurd to talk about what the President had done as a 10-year-old boy,” he sniffed to MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell, which is as near as the suddenly sheepish attack dog will ever get to conceding that Barack Obama is the first dog-eating president in the history of the Republic. For those coming late to the feud, the Democrats started it, assiduously promoting accounts of a 1983 Romney vacation to Canada in which the family pooch Seamus rode on the roof of the car. Axelrod and the boys thought they could have some sport with this, and their poodles in the media eagerly played along. The New York columnist Gail Collins alone has referred to it dozens of times.

Among upcoming events in California:
Building ventilation standards of the early to mid-1900s called for 15 cubic feet per minute of outside air for each occupant. With the oil embargo of 1973 and spurred efforts to conserve energy, these standards were reduced to five cfms per building occupant, thereby increasing indoor pollution. The cfm ventilation standard was recently revised upwards by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers to a minimum of 15 cfms per person, and 20 cfms in office spaces.

Smokler's irreverent look at motherhood has drawn a community of devoted parents on the blog, and the book promises more. An excerpt from Chapter 1: "I joined a gym just for the free day care. I drop the kids off and read magazines and blogs in the locker room." Another: "I kiss my young teenager good-bye in the morning as she leaves for school, rising above the hormone-fueled snarling and histrionics. Then I close the door and flip her off, with both hands."

The one move we'd like to see, if only to bring one more interesting team to the party? Steve Nash to Orlando. Problem: There are ways to make it add up to $11.6M, but good luck convincing Phoenix that Ryan Anderson can't be part of the exchange. If Boston decides to bust it up, we want to see Ray Allen on the Clippers — just to keep OKC, the runaway best out West — honest.

It is difficult to discern exactly what sorts of places Runte believes should be off limits to wind farms. He refers to "wilderness," places of "natural beauty" and "public lands." Some critics of old-fashioned environmentalism argue that the concept of "wilderness" is in fact unworkable; most such areas have long been shaped by human hands, and the idea of wilderness is a recent, Western invention. But that point aside, certainly there are many places of natural beauty that already accommodate humankind's presence and handiwork. Most of our public lands certainly do, in the form of logging or livestock grazing, for example -- not to mention tourism, an industry that Runte fears will be harmed by wind farms. In any event, it seems highly unlikely that wind-powered turbines are going to be tolerated at the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone.
The lawyer for Patricia Krentcil of Nutley entered the plea for her during an appearance Wednesday morning in Superior Court in Newark, N.J.
Her test will look for the single gene that causes Huntington's, but most diseases have a more complicated genetic profile. A growing number of tests look at multiple genes that might increase or decrease a person's risk for developing thousands of diseases.

But those kinds of results are not always reliable, says Ardis Dee Hoven, former chair of the American Medical Association.

The collaborative project's self-titled debut, which came out Tuesday, is a minimalist, sample-driven electronic record steeped in found sounds and a large cast of noted local guest vocalists. It will upend many of the expectations placed on an heir to L.A. blues-rock and might even make a frontman out of him yet.

The beefed-up Los Angeles Police Department probe comes in the wake of a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles by the rapper's mother, Voletta Wallace, and other relatives. Whatever new evidence the police turn up could bolster the city's contention that LAPD officers played no role in the rapper's death. Wallace maintains they did.
The work of getting a student to a four-year college has to start long before college application time, however. That's why PNC Bank's efforts to improve early childhood education -- and thus K-12th grade education -- with generous grants and by supporting bank employees who volunteer to help in pre-school classrooms for low-income youngsters deserve high praise.

The homicides of 24 Haditha civilians, including women and children, for example, resulted in court-martial charges against eight Marines, including four officers.

"We come into this world fully compassionate," agrees Patrick-Goudreau. "I believe the most fundamentally damaging thing we do to children is inure them to animal suffering by justifying abuse so that we can eat animals, make them perform for us, wear them, test on them, ad nauseum." Beck suggests that the best ways to educate children about veganism are to take them to farm sanctuaries, read them books like "That's Why We Don't Eat Animals," and, most importantly, "make sure the food they eat is delicious. Kids learn that vegetables are gross because that's how we teach them about vegetables," Beck says. "If we're like, 'vegetables rule,' and then cook them well, it will make all the difference."

Both of these movies have their flaws yet both still have a puncher's chance at stealing the Oscar. "Midnight in Paris" is light and fluffy, but gets a boost from being Woody Allen's biggest box office hit and Allen still gets a lot of love from the Academy, even if he won't show up for the show. "The Help" is elevated for tackling the weighty subject of racial tension in the segregated South and for being the highest grossing movie of the lot, but loses points for being just a little too cutesy and stereotypical.

The Reid plan is far from perfect. It doesn't do enough over the long term to control the deficit — the bond rating agency Standard & Poor's has indicated that it's looking for $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade to prevent a credit downgrade — and it relies solely on spending cuts without asking corporations or the wealthy to contribute to the solution. It's theoretically possible that some kind of grand bargain could still emerge — perhaps along the lines of the "Gang of Six" plan in the Senate that pairs spending cuts with revenue increases. But at this point, some version of the Reid plan remains the most likely vehicle to avoid a default on the nation's debt, which would have catastrophic effects on an economy that, according to new figures released Friday, is barely growing as it is.

With Luther, I would rather be governed by an honest and capable man of a different religious faith than by a corrupt and ineffective politician who attended my church.

We left Florida on Super Bowl Sunday. I feared being disconnected from America on one of the few days its many quarrelsome political and special interest groups come together, if only to pass the chips and dip and, in my case, root against the Pittsburgh Steelers. But after missing the first half of the game, due to shipboard commitments, I found it was on television in our state room on the ESPN International channel. You have to watch the Super Bowl if you're an American. If you don't, it means the terrorists win, or something like that.

But St. Louis had a measurable product of its own that affected the game around the country, even if for years it played by different rules than its Eastern counterparts. St. Louis' soccer leaders went on to be leaders at the national level; its players represented the country at the international level. When the U.S. national team was floundering in qualifying for the 1958 World Cup, the U.S. Soccer Federation got rid of the whole squad and had St. Louis' Kutis club team represent them in the final two qualifying games. (There would be no St. Louis magic; the team lost both its remaining games and didn't qualify.)

What do you do when you have more fresh milk than you can sell? Make darn good cheese with the rest. Of course, its a bonus if you have a cheesemaking room so city folk (aka agritourists) can watch after they get bored petting the cute calves over in the barn. Shattos milk  sold in glass bottles and available in an ever-expanding rainbow of colors and flavors  has become iconic, even though the company has been leaving milk mustaches only since 2003. The chocolate milk was ranked among the top three in the world at a recent dairy expo. But that doesnt mean owner Leroy Shatto is resting on his laurels. Shatto and cheesemaker Gary Campbell also are gaining recognition from cheese connoisseurs for their aged cheeses, such as Shattos Parrano (part gouda/part Parmesan), which placed 16th out of 58 in the 2010 World Championship Cheese Competition. Not bad for guys who have been making cheese for less than a year. It takes 10 pounds of milk to make 1 pound of cheese. This spring, Shatto opened a window into the cheesemaking process with a room that allows visitors to the farm to watch the handling of the curds and whey. Shatto estimates 160 to 200 people make the trip to his farm in Osborn, Mo., on any given day.
