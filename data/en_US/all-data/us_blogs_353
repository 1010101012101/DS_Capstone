“But wait, Rose,” I paused to remonstrate with myself. “You hate horror books. You hate horror movies. You cannot even walk to your house in the dark alone without thinking you’re going to be stabbed to death by a really tall, stringy-haired, uncouth masked murderer. Remember when you watched Saw 4? You nearly puked and you still can’t stand tape-recorded voices! You couldn’t sleep for weeks after you were FORCED by Danny and Jaci to see Paranormal Activity. For heaven’s sake, Rose, when your siblings want to scare you, they sneak up behind you and play the Michael Myers theme music on their phones! WHY are you going to read a horror novel?”

In true kaiseki style, all the dishes were exquisitely presented and our sashimi course was a vision of pink chrysanthemums, sculpted ice, polished pebbles and pretty foliage. The Toro from Spain was heavenly; the chunky cut giving it a real meaty quality when bit into. The Uni from Santa Barbera was nice and sweet but a touch over-powering on the finish. On the other hand, the Kampachi (yellowtail) from Japan was outstanding, creamier than any I’ve tasted, no doubt as a result of the way it was cut (with thin lines through it, not unlike how squid sashimi is usually prepared).

This is one of my favorite meals to prepare. It’s quick and easy, but the flavors are so fresh and bright. The lemons and capers give the typically bland chicken wonderful flavor. Each cutlet is nice and thin, but one is enough with this rich sauce. It’s so easy to make that it’s definitely a weeknight meal, but it can easily be served when entertaining and it wont disappoint! You wont order this classic out once you realize just how easy it is to make at home.

Hobo Crane’s life is the pits. He’s the star player on his eighth-grade basketball team though he hates playing. Then there’s the nosy neighbor girl with a Jupiter-sized crush on him who invades his kitchen after school every day to help with the Crane family catering business.
I used 1/2 ratio on rice and water, but slowly added stock as it simmered. But first...start off like you would a risotto (it will not be creamy as a risotto). Saute onions in oil, add rice (to pop open hull, and let moisture in as it cooks); add seasonings, and stir before you add the first cup of chicken or beef stock, or any stock you desire.

You can see two that I used on my layout for this week, as well as one made from my file folder labels. I got the idea to add the days of the week to them when I saw another one almost exactly like it on Pinterest the day after I made my labels! I made the little labels on the card next to it too. I've seen a digital kit that has labels like that with numbers on them, but I figured I'd leave mine blank so you could add days of the week, numbers, letters - whatever. The middle two cards were me playing with the digital washi tape some more.

Julia Ormond played Audrey Hepburn's character in the 1954 movie Sabrina, but she most certainly isn't looking very Hepburn in this hideous creation. Whoever made this hideous lacey nightmare should be shot, and poor Julia's stylist forced to wearing hanging from the skyway by the Kodak Theater. We've seen these type dresses before though and it probably won't be the last.
In the international paradise envisioned by Marx, the lumpenproletariat will be killed, and there will be no Welfare State. Welfare is a weapon to undermine society, but it will not be tolerated in the Workers' Republic, in which those who will not work, will die. Note that Marxist organisations such as the SWP campaign for Jobs. Those who believe that the 'left' support the workless, are mistaken.

"A South African government minister reportedly spends the equivalent of nearly $70,000(US) of taxpayer money on a trip to Switzerland to visit his girlfriend in jail who is facing drug charges, then tells his president that he was on official business. He claims to have been on sick leave since February. Another minister and the police chief were implicated in an unlawful deal to lease police buildings at inflated prices, which then cost taxpayers more than $250 million(US).

So two decades on I shouldn’t have been surprised to find myself on hands and knees, groping at the back of a different supermarket’s shelves for the last few packets of salt. There is no war to threaten supplies of this kitchen essential, but it is open season on pickling and bottling round here. Much of the summer’s superabundant vegetables have already been put under oil and brine, literally salted away for winter use. But right now the olive harvest is in full swing.
The news of a genuine ghost haunting the old mansion in which H.

Then the ghost disappeared for a few days and the excitement abated.
Westerners should concentrate on the key matter that concerns us. Our people must understand that Islam is not a mutated version of Christianity with a pacifist core in which the Meek will inherit the earth; it’s a creed of War and the Sword. It is inflamed by victory, and encouraged by successive advances. Once they start fighting, the only thing its followers understand is defeat. The centuries in which Islam has slumbered have all followed massive defeats which shattered the conceit that its date with Destiny and world domination was just around the corner.

As for how Kalia likes them, she loves them as well. She pulls off the books that she wants to look at, flips through them, then says "all done" and we clap our hands when we put them back on the shelf. She's just starting to learn how to put things back. Even when she leaves books on the floor, it takes a maximum of three minutes to put them back on the shelf. As any mother knows, most babies leave a wake of destruction wherever they go, so whether it's in her room or in her playroom (post on that soon!), it's all the same to me!

“Which can be true,” said the priest, “but what about three plus one or seven minus three or the square root of sixteen?” He had lost them there. “Reasons, if they exist at all, are always to be found before we do things; answers, once we’ve worked them out (if we ever figure them out), always come into being the fact.”

She proceeded to tell me about how she wished she had been able to breastfeed her sons. She had contracted a blood born disease while working as a nurse and the physicians believed she would be putting herself and her sons in harms way by nursing them. She said she was heartbroken to know she wouldn't be nursing her sons. Go figure, Grandma's a Lactivist!!! I was shocked knowing that, in the time my parents were born, everyone was using formula. During the second World War, breastfeeding was thought to be dirty and primitive and formula was the greatest technological advancement in baby care EVER!!! It wasn't until the 1960's and the hippie movement that breastfeeding became slightly more prevalent. Then, research in the 1980's indicated that some formulas were better than others and that breastmilk was, in fact, not dirty or dangerous. During that time was the push for soy based formula (which we now know is one of the worst and should be avoided if at all possible... funny how things change). I was not exclusively breastfed and neither was Ryan. It's pretty uncommon for someone even as young as our generation to have been exclusively breastfed until the age of 1 (when cow's milk can be introduced to substitute breastmilk/formula).

It’s a pretty harsh message for a country to essentially give up on a city. The state of California recently considered a plan to do something similar in the economically troubled — and some say corrupt — city of Vernon. That plan was rejected by the state legislature, mainly over concerns that its passage would harm the local economy further. It’s tough to say what the exact result will be in the newly enlarged Hefei, but even a modest reduction in the city’s 17 percent growth rate would be hard for Chinese officials to worry about.

By contrast the brutal Fomorians are out to exploit nature, rather than be a part of it. They had features “hanging like seaweed when the tide is out, their tongues the colour and shape of cormorant tongues, the clamour of the ocean their talk”.

When I was in my 20′s, I did smoke. I knew it was bad for me, but I did it anyway. I didn’t have any trouble quitting after I got asthma every time I took a drag on my cigarette. I couldn’t breathe.

It really wasn’t good for me!

Sanctuary uses reclaimed needle-work to reinterpret historical bird and insect paintings and is the result of two years of solid work. Each piece is painstakingly constructed by pinning the deconstructed embroidery pieces to nylon tulle to create texture and fill in the detail. Oh, and what detail!!

She wants to feel like you are as invested in the relationship as she has been and will continue to be! She needs your security!

I am not saying marriage is for everyone but if it’s for your woman and you love her, MAN UP! Do what you have to do to keep her!

the project is a shameful mark in Kuwait’s history and is very much a racist project in a country that is known of its civil bodies and establishments.

There is a lot more as well that I am happy about, but we'll just stop there.

That 70′s Show did indeed jump the shark before the final season. When Eric Foreman (Topher Grace) and Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher) both left the show, everyone kinda felt like “what the hell? How can the show even go on with 2 of the 4-or-so main characters going AWOL?”. However, the season was still mildly entertaining. And the finale provided a lot of closure. Maybe not as much as the Six Feet Under finale (um — I’ve neverwitnessed a finale as thorough on closure as Six Feet Under. Never.), but at least we get a sense of who ends up with who.

For there are none as conservative, as intolerant, as teenagers when it comes to those who are beyond the perimeters of what is in, and the instinct of the herd to mob the one who is different (particularly when that one is weaker) is very strong. What I learned from Brendan’s story is that this instinct remains just as active even when those teenagers have reached what is supposed to be (young) adulthood.

The teaching schedule so far has been pretty empty. Crusader Powel mentioned several of the classes I had been scheduled to handle had been moved to a different initiate due to my late arrival (the storm I mentioned earlier had set us off course and delayed our arrival by several days!) I have spent most of my time here so far preparing reading over their materials for the classes I may or may not end up teaching and generally getting to know the other priests and paladins here. Quite a few of them have similar interests in the theory of the Light as I do and have wished to speak of it further. We have had several long discussions over the dinner tables here and

As a mother of two VERY energetic and mischievous children, I often long for a little quite time alone in my room.....Who knew I would be so happy to say goodbye to a quiet/dark room, overworn pajamas, and sunglasses that felt glued to my face 24/7. Well, today I did just that..."I got up again" and pedaled my bike as fast I as I could, in a dress, with one eye functioning all while humming "Chariots of Fire" towards a great local cafe, Cantuccio (link to Cantuccio). I am sure I was not the prettiest chicken with my droopy eyes, drool running down my face as the first bite of tomato salad and warm cheese hit my tongue all while snorting at my friends and their funny stories.

Overall the gross enrolment rate in higher education in India is still less than 15 per cent. These figures show significant disparities across class, caste, gender and region. It is also less than the world average of 23 per cent. Secondly, despite the government’s constant pledge to raise public spending in education to at least 6 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), public spending on education still remains at less than 4 per cent of GDP. This is much lower than the share in a number of developing countries. The average share of higher education in the total education expenditure of both Central and State governments has come down from 14 percent during 1981-82 to 1991-92 to 12.7 percent during 1992-93 to 2003-04.

However, this does not mean that after illumination, we will forget everything and just want to become monks. What occurs if we accept, rather than reject, the grace itself of illumination, is that our thoughts – thoughts not concerned with God – will become expelled from the very heart of our souls, and the Presence of God the Father, through the Holy Spirit, will descend to live in the heart of our souls – the spiritual coming of the Kingdom. Making us capable of being engaged in earthly tasks while concurrently worshipping Our Father from our hearts in Spirit and in Truth: prayer of the heart.

I never saw the videotape, but I had wanted to do SOMETHING to help ease her pain. I used clay to start a "Survivor" series of art sculptures and jewelry. I wanted to show women going through the painful "cure" for cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, nausea, skin burns, perceived loss of femininity) that they ARE still beautiful and worthy of being happy. So each survivor necklace is hand-painted with hopeful colors and they sometimes accentuate the missing appendage - a portion of the sales goes to the Komen Race for the Cure Foundation. Each Cancer Survivor Goddess sculpture is shining with positive energy. Each sculptural bust is thought-provoking and beautiful. Mom appreciated the Survivor series and proudly wore the neckpieces with many of her outfits. In fact, "Contemplating old Wounds" won Best of Show at the Valley Sculpture Artists art competition and an Award of Merit at the California State Fair.

Sad that I feel like I’m failing, that there’s a part of me inside that feels dead. Sad that he hasn’t been the only one who has thought there’s only one way out of this. Sad that I don’t know if I believe that our situation will change. Sad that he’s spent the whole week battling with hate and contempt for me. Sad that he thinks the resolution for all of this is for me to be done.

The Japanese government’s response to the issue of has been the same for several years. They are not willing to change anything. Former Taiji Mayor S. Hamanaka stated in 1994 that “we believe we know more about our own sea in Taiji than anyone who lives thousands of miles away from us. We also believe we are more concerned with its protection and assume more responsibilities than anybody else in the world”. Further on, he says that “we hope many environmentally concerned people in the industrialized nations will understand our views and trust us as rational and humane people”. The Taiji fishermen and the Japanese government conducting these horrible dolphin hunts can not be trusted as rational and humane people, when what they are doing to these marine mammals is both irrational and inhumane.

And I would even go so far as to also state, there is no following without believing and there is no Luke 9:23 without John 3:16. In my mind, they are mutually exclusive. Following without believing can be as big a problem as believing without following.
Earlier this past week, last Monday, I had another dream related to my death. Sort of… The dream was about what happens after my death, it was about reincarnation. I don’t remember the whole dream since it happened a week ago, but I do remember the major part. All I remember was I was standing in this grassy plain with a small trickling stream. The area was really really bright. The sun was really close to us, yet it was cold. I was standing in line to go up to the little river. When I was second in line I saw the guy in front of me, I couldn’t see his face; for some reason I can’t see faces in my dreams. He stepped in the stream and this voice called his name that I don’t remember. Then, out of nowhere a thought bubble appeared in front of him. The vision was of an attractive dark haired pregnant woman and her husband.

It is imperative that you don’t arrive late for an interview. It will not impress your interviewer and they will question whether you can actually be on time for the job itself! If your car or the train breaks down en route or you get stuck in traffic – remember to call ahead in plenty of time. If you had a late night, nursing a hangover and still in bed an hour before the appointment you clearly are not serious about the job and should do the polite thing and cancel. Try to arrive in good time in order to familiarise yourself with the location, freshen up and relax.

The condescension inherent in this vision is apparent in every step of Julia’s pilgrimage toward a community-gardening retirement.

Mix together cream cheese, instant pudding and crushed pineapple with juice. The trick here is to beat the cream cheese until it is very light and fluffy adding the pudding mix with most of the pineapple juice. When this is done stir in the remaining crushed pineapple and any leftover juice. Gently fold in whipped topping to the mixture. It is important to fold in the whipped topping with a large spatula, because you do not want to beat the dickens out of the air in the whipped topping.

JULY 15 — On July 9, I did something for my country. I walked with my neighbours, my friends, and fellow strangers. Different and segmented as our personal lives may be, but in cause, there is no doubt in my mind, that we are one.
I made a decision. I know. Ca-razy... but I did.
Hospitality: Very good. In particular, there is a lady who greets you when you come into the dance hall and finds you a place to sit, and she did an excellent job. Having established what languages I spoke or understood, she sat me with some Italians of similar age to myself, and we got on very well. There is enough space for the seating and there are enough seats for the people, so you can keep yours and nest a bit, which makes a huge difference to the social aspect. It was so nice to have an idea where people were, or at least where they were likely to return to, and not to have your things muddled up all the time. There isn't water on the tables, but a free drink is included in entry for each day, and nobody stops you bringing your own either. Wine and soft drinks from the bar, with prompt service, were all around 2€, espresso 1€, and sandwiches. The whole thing was very well organised. On arrival I got an envelope with my name on it containing wristbands for admission to each day, my free-drink vouchers and the timetable. The military-establishment loos were pretty rickety, though, the best I can say was that they were clean and worked and you could always find paper somewhere, if not always a perfectly dry piece of floor or anything to dry your hands. They aren't even segregated. On the other hand, the patio was a nice place to cool off or just retreat, and the doors to it were usually open.
Oh, yes, I have some Scotch in me, as well as Irish. My Scots were Border Reiver Forresters and Armstrongs. I haven't researched all my Scottish connections, but those are the ones I know of so far.
My mistake is that I try to find a rational component to reviews.
With our stomachs swilling with BN, it was decided nothing would sate our hunger like a session at Chez Denise. Somewhat full from the bread and saucisson I'd been munching at Le Garde Robe, I sat at our table, with its red-and-white checked tablecloth - and scanned the menu for something 'light'. I may as well have been looking for something non-fattening in a patisserie. Chez Denise is renowned for its meaty menu. Meals come in three varieties: meaty, extra-meaty and heart-stopping. My initial instinct was to go with Coq Au Vin - the closest thing on the menu to a salad. But when one of my dinner companions asked if I would share a cote de boeuf, I heard the words "I'd love to" spilling from my lips. I blame the wine.
My eyes met those of my mother-in-law, who was unloading the almond cookies she had brought with her, and putting the kettle on in the adjoining kitchen. She was smiling, and her eyes were full of an unaccustomed softness.

Like any family, we have regular little dos and don’ts that aren’t written down anywhere but are pretty well understood as law in our house. You heard these standards before, I’m sure: no running, don’t hit people, quiet voices indoors, don’t take your sister’s toys, clear your place when you’re finished, etc…. Such are important simply to ease the motions of living together in a household. And most of them are dictatorial and begin with negatives. Necessary, probably--but pleasant or life-affirming, definitely not.

Australia also has a huge number of people immigrating there, specially from the middle east and south east asian countries.

We ended up at The Cadillac Grille. The Cadillac is three restaurants in one. On one side is Billy's Giant Burgers, a very casual, family-oriented spot. This place is beloved by the locals as the best burger in town. On the other side is the Cadillac Grille Dining Room. This is the more upscale restaurant. In between is the Cadillac Lounge. It's the bar area and it serves alcohol (which Billy's does not) as well as both burgers from Billy's along with some of the appetizers from the Dining Room. We sat in the lounge, which has a rather interesting color scheme.

Scenes of cruelty characterize a minority of the newspaper strips, while they form the great mass of comic book content.
CR: Playing both roles has certainly helped me to better understand many aspects – how to interact with the other characters, what happens while I am off stage. Among the three women, Elvira is the most simple and clear. She is the one who had the wedding promise from Don Giovanni. They have had a three-day long passion, which is a lot for Don Giovanni … but he shirks,and she goes mad for being deserted, she runs after the fire but gets burnt and is devastated, until she decides she will not love any one any longer, and wants to enter a convent.

Now I have two weddings to go to sooner than later. I'm curious to find out who will be next...My cousin got engaged a few weeks ago and now my best friend. Maybe I'll catch the bouquet in one of the weddings ;). hehe.
I made the trip to the LNS to drop of my stitching pieces for framing. It will be longer than usual in getting them back because everyone likes to take advantage of a framing sale! I love the frames I chose. Especially for the holiday pieces. Not really what I had expected to go with but sometimes you see something that just screams at you! Also, I placed another order. Just a couple of designs I have drooling over for awhile. They are both on the big side and have detailed borders (not my favorite thing to stitch) but if my finishes are as pretty as the pictures, they should be worth the extra xx's.
While the trip was fun, I did come home with super sore muscles, and with a not so nice case of windburn on my face! Ah! Even with that, it was nice to do something fun for the weekend, sometimes you just need to getaway!

As Keats said, ‘I conclude,’ projecting to the camera, ‘now more than ever seems rich to die. To cease upon the midnight with no pain. A perfect death is a way to cheat the dulling, dumbing effect of time. To die at the heart of love is the only way to preserve its purity.’
The Breakdown: My suggestion to business owners that are unsure how to manage and engage their online audience is pretty simple. It only takes about two hours a week and can really make your businesses blog and social sites a place where your audience can gain new information about things related to your business. They will really appreciate the small extra steps you’re taking for them and that will only lead to a larger, more engaged and more active online audience.

In March 1954 Maxwell Fyfe told Cabinet: “ large numbers of coloured people are living on National Assistance” and that “coloured landlords by their conduct are making life difficult for white people living in the same building or area…the result is that white people leave and the accommodation is then converted to furnished lettings for coloured people, with serious overcrowding and exploitation”.

Over time, I came to realize that control in some aspects of life doesn't necessarily translate well to others; for proof, just ask my first wife. When I became a parent, I began to see some interesting distinctions between controlling processes and controlling people. I came to understand that a process, as an inanimate object with no sense of purpose or thought, can be controlled in virtually any circumstance. But a person? Well, that's a whole other story. People think, they feel, they have their own goals and dreams and ideal outcomes, and as such can be resistant to being controlled, even guided, in ways they don't identify with. Influenced? Perhaps. But controlled? No. Not that knowing that stops us from trying, mind you.
Adults don’t think children will remember episodes of their childhood, or they don’t think they digest conversations.

Compare that to watching someone battle a chronic, degenerative disease that has developed to its glorious pinnacle of importance – end stage renal failure.

She’s wasting away right in front of your eyes despite valiant efforts to be otherwise. The only thing that’s keeping everybody involved sane is prayer. That last part sounds cliché and corny as well but, if prayer couldn’t keep you sane, what could? I have to say it sounds hilarious right now but I believe what makes it so damn funny to me is the fact that it’s so damn true.

An ordinary day begins with getting out of bed. Yes, it is for everyone but for DG it is important for DG because waking up at a decent hour and without pain is a biggie. There after day begins by the book and the buzzer. Yes, she has to use timer for ordinary things like bed, bath, breakfast, lunch and so on. She eats same breakfast day after day with exception to Sunday when IK takes her to Gurudwara for early morning meditation.

Who’ll Love It: This is a fantastic introduction to fundamentalism, and I say that as someone who has been following Christian culture in America with some interest. If you’ve never encountered the God Squad in the U.S. of A., you’ll get a broad-based view of them here. The book may highlight some of the kookier elements (like the Christian variant of World Wrestling Entertainment!) but it does so in a light, mostly-loving way. Judgment isn’t Radosh’s aim here, which is what gives the book its charm. Avid fundamentalist-watchers will find lots to love here as well, even if they’re already familiar with Answers in Genesis, Christian music, or Left Behind. The conversations with more nuanced thinkers within Christian culture will both inspire and challenge the reader. And I was absolutely riveted by an intensely personal scene in which Radosh, whose children were born through IVF, confronts a pro-life pamphleteer after reading his argument against artificial insemination.

Released in 1953, directed by Charles Walters, and all about fixing broken hearts, the supremely magical Lili starred Leslie Caron (very young and lovely), Mel Ferrer and a bunch of puppets. The film is a favorite of both John Waters and H.L. Mencken (Baltimore loves Lili, eh?), and has never been available for home viewing, except for a rare showing on Turner Classic Movies.
Enter the 1980s. This dresser was found at my local Goodwill. When I first saw it, I wasn't convinced that it was what I wanted. Plus, it wasn't on sale. Seriously. How cheap am I that I won't buy something from a thrift store if it isn't on sale. It's sad, really. Anywhoo, the next time I went back to the store, it was half off. I stood back and imagined it with a few tweaks and realized it was perfect! So for $15 (yes, $30 was too much to pay), I took it home. Let me tell you, this chunk of wood is HEAVY. I injured my neck trying to lift just one side of it. It was a job for strong men.

Part of the theory is simple - the beer is brewed as normal. Before racking, all of the yeast and sediment is extracted from the beer. The beer is then racked, and yeast beads are put in each barrel. So in the barrel is beer, and yeast. The yeast beads are heavy, and therefore the beer is constantly clear - no little particles forming hazy beer are available.

At last, Miranda is the life of the party: all she had to do was die. Elevated and adopted by none other than the reigning King of the Mantle of Dracul, Miranda goes from high-school theater wannabe to glamorous royal fiend overnight. Meanwhile, her reckless and adoring guardian angel, Zachary, demoted to human guise as the princess’s personal assistant, has his work cut out for him trying to save his girl’s soul and plan the Master’s fast-approaching Death Day gala. In alternating points of view, Miranda and Zachary navigate a cut-throat eternal aristocracy as they play out a dangerous and darkly hilarious love story for the ages.

I wasn’t sure if I wanted to witness any fighting in person. We started the night with some Noodlecat Happy Hour, headed to the Golden Gloves, then finished it at Map Room. I love Saturdays!

She was jittery. That much was quite plain to see. The long drags she was taking on her fourth cigarette were definitely not helping. Every few seconds she would nervously reach out to her laptop, curl her fingers away in disgust, but then succumb in checking her Facebook. Her friends’ incessant talking was not really helping her in this never-ending quest to stay calm. However, as she always did when she was nervous, she continued to jingle her foot up and down.

The last major case of asylum was Fang Lizhi, who sought asylum in the US Embassy in Beijing for one year. It exacerbated the rift in bilateral relations, which had followed the 6.4 Tiananmen Crisis. No such crisis in bilateral relations exist today. However, Beijing’s elites are extremely concerned about any hint of internal instability following the Bo Xilai incident and the upcoming 18th Party Congress. It is possible that a more conservative elite faction might exploit this bilateral dispute into a full-scale conflict to promote a particular anti-US position. Or Wen Jiabao will respond to Cheng Guangcheng’s request to investigate the corrupt practices of the Linyi cadre and resolve the issue quietly. Probably, both will happen.

This is a quick bread, which means the leavening comes from baking soda rather than yeast. It also means it offers instant gratification and would be fun to do with kids. Grandma's recipe included a full cup of sugar, white flour, and oleo. I decided to swap honey and maple syrup for the sugar and halve the amount, use white whole wheat flour, and use butter instead of the shortening. My bread still has a strong banana flavor and is very moist, but is a bit better for you than the traditional version.
It’s funny though how none of the people in this thread have actually tackled the issue of the photo I tagged them and their friends in. They all talk about how I must hold to the possibility that a god could exist, even if there isn’t a single shred of evidence or how the only true “non-belief” is agnosticism, s**t like this. The only thing B could do was say that I’m being antagonistic and liking one of your comments. In only ONE comment did someone actually take on the photo and that was you, and the second I responded to it, you knew that you had been defeated and you ran away and came back to tell me how I’m being disrespectful (which I have no problem with people calling me that, because, again, I don’t respect the religious). Seriously people, if you’re going to debate me, stick to the f**king issues at hand and stop feeling like you’ve won, because there are four or five of you believing f**ktards and one atheist, and because I didn’t respond to all of your bulls**t arguments.

The whole biker film genre has always ranked fairly low in my esteem, just above the bottom rung of WIP (Women in Prison) films and 1980s sex comedies. I never understood the appeal of watching a bunch of motorcycles ride this way and that, hearing them make loud nosies as their riders set about harassing innocent beachgoers, sexually assaulting housewives and driving Cameron Mitchell to retaliatory violence (I'm referring naturally to 1970's THE REBEL ROUSERS). I just don't get it. But I respect it.

This lore is often considered the biggest downfall of the Spellsinger and when compared to the other lores of magic our stronger wizards can take, its hard not to disagree. However there are a few spells that deserve special mention that are great to have in just about any army. Spellsinging is our signature spell and gives you D3+1" movement of forests and causes damage to any unit that is within a forest. A nice spell and certainly worth taking (check out my forest tactics). The Hidden Path grants immunity to mundane shooting attacks which is very effective when you want a fragile unit and/or an expensive unit to get to the enemy without being shot to pieces. Ariels Blessing grants regeneration similar to the Lore of Lifes only better as it can be cast on any unit as opposed to just the unit your caster is in. And call of hunt which increases mobility and attack potential. If you take a level 2 wizard you will nearly always want treesinging (if you plan to use forest tactics) and 1 of the mentioned spells above. This gives you some good strong magic that you can cast in conjunction with your level 4.

In line with the recent findings that blood pressure medications compromise the circulation to vital tissues, a recent study found low treated blood pressure was associated with poor thinking, and mild hypertension was associated with better thinking.20 By over-aggressive lowering of blood pressure with medication function of the brain in the elderly was found to be impaired. The best brain function was associated with a blood pressure of about 159/85 mm Hg (a level consistent with the lowest risk of strokes, heart attacks, and deaths). This loss of intelligence may be permanent in some cases. Just published in the journal Stroke are the findings that patients whose systolic blood pressure (the top number) dropped 15 mmHg or more in six years or less had triple the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, or other forms of dementia.21 Their findings indicate that poor blood flow to the brain, resulting from a decline in blood pressure, in some cases from over-treatment with anti-hypertensive medications, promotes permanent loss of brain function – dementia.

Moms factor in many elements on decision-making for their kids’ school; locations, tuition, teachers, environment, quality of education, etc. In our case, it was a bit complicated. I won’t bore you with details. To make a long story short, the main reasons for me to put my second child in a French school is that 1. her best friend here who is also our neighbor and whose mom, a Senegalese, is my really good friend, goes to this school, 2. it seems like a fun place for my girl to be and she liked it and 3. the teacher/founder of the school is wonderful and cares children with love. There are a ton of toys and as soon as she walked in, she went straight to a room with a kitchen and started playing with her friend. What else do I need to see?

- In October, the state of Kansas launched an anti-obesity program extolling the value of drinking plain water. The taxpayer funded program will include TV commercials, billboards, and posters. The program wants to get Kansas kids to drink less soda and theoretically become less obese.
If that's truly the case, why do so many people continually ask for book of all 365 designs, despite the fact that all of them are here online, for free?
Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? takes its title from the response Winterson’s adoptive mother made when she told her how happy she was in a relationship with another woman. Ah, Mrs Winterson, who has loomed large in the public perception of the author to the detriment of two and a half decades of interesting work. She only has herself to blame, perhaps, having begun her career with a semi-autobiographical novel, and having begun that novel with a depiction of her monstrous mother. (“Like most people, I lived for a long time with my mother and father. My father liked to watch the wrestling. My mother liked to wrestle. It didn’t matter what. She was in the white corner and that was that.”) For Oranges are not the only fruit to have become Winterson’s most famous book is not very surprising: it’s her most straightforward, her most plainly warm and witty and affecting. (The award-hogging TV adaptation didn’t hurt.) What came next in her fiction was always more ambitious, and to me more interesting, even when it felt inchoate or reiterative. Oranges is the book, twenty-six years old, which is still the only one namechecked on this cover; though that’s apt enough as it seems clear that this memoir is destined to become her second most famous.
The outside walls of the kitchen were made of glass. I had never seen what happens when people go out of their minds with rage.
In the second version there, I left out one argument that I discussed the first time. Between saying that he doesn’t believe in God by choice, and saying that the atheological evidentialist objector may regard the theist-without-evidence as sick or malfunctioning, Plantinga argues that there is not a general obligation to have evidence for everything you believe, thus:
Earth has been ruled for two thousand years by the Partussy Empire. The administration is totally corrupt. That all may be coming to an end thanks to a fired civil servant and an Earthman caught in the middle. This is a good read that comes to an ironic ending.

He has also done his homework. The book is filled with references to other paranormal researchers and cryptozoologists, and the bibliography is four pages long. If you accept Mr. Riggs’s conclusions, you will almost certainly want to pay a visit to these sites yourself, and dig deeper in the books he lists.
It isn't unusual that she will go out and meet people, who sees nothing beneath her bubbly exterior, and greet her with warm hugs and chatty company. She thaws for them, even for the moments right after their departure, but then the same lone rider always return, wrapping her in his cape of darkness.

That was when he finally started writing his reconnaissance down. Even then, he sometimes had to convince himself that the reports written in his handwriting weren't made up. Even took to writing, "Verified. This is true," in the margins.
Listening requires one to listen actively, so as to make sense of what is happening. And while reading also requires a certain amount of attention, hearing is transmitted to the brain more directly (since input through the ears is received by the brain faster than input from the eyes). Maybe that’s why it seems easier to pay attention to something heard than something read. After all, most of us learn to speak more naturally than we learn to read or to write.
Saarah also informed me of all the spots that she would like to see her flowers planted(we planted some seeds indoors recently, in hopes that we’ll be able to put them outside next month, when it’s finally warm enough). Tevye is pestering me to plant the vegetable seeds that he helped pick out, but we don’t have any more containers to put them in. I’m hopeful that we can pick something up on the weekend and get this show going.
It’s so nostalgic to see Vanness Wu again, it’s has been 10 years ago since I saw him in F4. I am surprised to see him still handsome and more handsome I think. And now after that 10 years ago I am able to see him again and he has collaboration with Jun Ho 2Pm, that’s more that cool dude.

When Tebow kneels on the field, his religion becomes challengingly present. Tebow doesn’t have to get into a bunch of Jesus Talk to put you or me in an uncomfortable state of mind. It’s more subtle than that. Murray suggests, if I have a reaction to The Knee, it’s because Tebow implies “that there is something in the universe over and above the natural which deserves my attention, allegiance, or honor and I find that distasteful or irritating.”
When I signed up for a beginner adult class at a local acrobatic school at the end of August 2011, I was beyond excited to get started. In my first session, I easily performed all of the movements required to advance to the progressions needed to do a back handspring: front and back rolls, round offs, back arches, back walkovers, etc. By the second session, I was performing vertical backwards jumps onto large mats to prepare me for the height and speed required to execute a back handspring on a ‘boulder’ (which is a cylindrical mat used to mimic the arc made in the air when performing a back handspring).
Over the past weekend the CDOT crew and I were invited to participate in Hot Hacks, which is a two day long hack-a-thon centered around creating a web native portion to existing documentaries.

The 6 documentaries were as follows:

We’re all better off when labor is divided such that the most productive firms in a given industry are allowed to specialize, regardless of their locality. Carried to its logical end, such anti-trade arguments would reduce our standards of living to that of hunter-gatherers. If it’s bad to trade with foreigners why wouldn’t it also be harmful to trade interstate, across town, or between neighbors? It’s not, of course.

Last night I took some time to get 'little things' done. Things that pile up because they can always be left off 'until tomorrow'. Among cleaning up from having company over on Sunday, I also clipped the critters nails with The Hubs' help. Afterward, as I was motivated at the 'little things' being crossed off my list, I wandered down into the scrapbook area to clean up and put things away from a weekend crop I'd enjoyed (as well as search for Something Very Important that I have lost - and have yet to find).
Sorry I’ve been away for so long, but I’ve been doing stuff like this (and recuperating afterwards).

Not in the hands of a man who loves you. Sex can be a beautiful thing. Sex can be an intimate thing. One thing about this book of mine, it takes you into the interiority of the feminine experience. I’m not sure men have read that before? I’m not. So I began to strive to write that and in this book men are going to encounter all aspects of the feminine.
Wait, I should probably tell you what’s happening. So they’re still going wherever the slaver Tvlakv— no really, how the hell do you pronounce that?—is taking them.

At least one reader felt that my solution to yelling in my post "You can stop yelling at your children" was trite. For parents who are just trying to get through the day any advice can sound unrealistic. The feeling of "that's easy for you to say...." bubbles quickly to the surface. My closing, "You can stop yelling at your children. Start by focusing on your relationships, letting go of your expectations and meeting the needs of each family member" would have pushed my buttons when I was struggling through each day with three children ages 4 and under. I would have told you that all I did was meet my family's needs: laundry, dishes, cooking, nursing, and changing diapers. If you felt that way about the post, I hope you will go back to it and click on some of the links to past blogs. The past blogs go into more detail and explain what I meant by focusing on relationships, and to which expectations and needs I was referring.
Across the narrow sea in the mysterious city of Qarth, Dany still has her own hazards to navigate even though she is nominally a guest of the city. At a lavish party thrown by her immensely wealthy host Xaro Xhoan Daxos, a “warlock” from “the House of the Undying” introduces himself to Dany and his magic tricks. Xaro claims they are simply parlor tricks that are the product of a drug-addled mind, but Dany seems unsure. A masked woman also warns Jorah (and knows much of him) to keep close guard of Dany for she is not safe in Qarth. Later, Dany and Xaro go on a walk to Xaro’s massive vault of all of his riches. He offers her an army and a guaranteed victory in Westeros if she will be his bride (and also informs her of the death of Robert though he doesn’t know what happened to Renly yet). Dany honestly considers it but Jorah warns against it. If she invades Westeros with a foreign army, she will never have the love of the people. We also get even more hints of the romantic feelings that Jorah has developed for Dany over the course of the series. Somewhere in Westeros, Cately and Brienne are still running from the men loyal to Renly when Brienne declares her new loyalty to Cat, to serve and protect her as long as she doesn’t stop her from taking revenge against Stannis when the time comes. In Winterfell, Bran hears of the attack by Theon’s men (doesn’t know it’s Theon. Thinks it’s the Lannisters) and sends soldiers to defend Torrhen Square, unknowingly leaving Winterfell open to invasion. He also has a dream where the Sea destroys Winterfell. Beyond the Wall, the Night’s Watch are incredibly far north where they meet up with ranger-supreme Qhorin Halfhand who has dire news about the size and strength of Mance Rayder’s army. He takes Jon on a reconnaissance mission to further investigate the enemy position. The episode ends back in Harrenhal where Jaqen H’gar makes good on his promise to kill the Tickler when the Tickler winds up dead in the castle’s square. Valar Morghulis.

I have always said ”a teenage boy picks up a guitar to become a rock star, in hopes of getting girls.” This is not to say he doesn’t love music, or has a natural gift for music, I am just “theorizing” that behind many of our incentives ( maybe just subconsciously) sex is the driving force. Much as a male peacock attracts female mates by showing off their beautiful feathers, us humans seem to use success, fame, money, skill, etc…, to attract members of the opposite sex ( or same sex depending on our sexuality).

It's taken from "A Short History of George Younger & Son Limited, Alloa (1762 - 1925)" published in 1925. My copy is a fairly cheapo reprint from the 1980's, typewritten, with a pretty blurry reproduction of the brewery map. I've redone the years, added the colours and generally touched up the image. Some of the years are a guess because they were so blurred in the original.
4. I love fairy tales, but dislike most modern fantasy and can’t stomach most fantasy based/sci-fi movies. If it includes dragons and fairies, then that usually just kills it for me. I love Grimm’s fairy tales, Hans Christian Andersen, Lewis Carroll, JRR Tolkein, etc. My favorite modern fantasy is the Harry Potter series, and The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch. My favorite mythological creature is the Mermaid and I have a special fondness for creatures of the sea, including squids, octopi, whales, seahorses, starfish, etc.
The overall response was higher, but the antenna did a poor job differentiating frequencies. In the critical range between 700MHz and 900MHz, the antenna’s response swung wildly. Unlike the whip antenna where the best response occurred near the desired frequency and fell off rapidly on both sides, the iPhone antenna had a very high response at frequencies lower than desired and the drop off was relatively slow in the higher frequencies.

What caught my eye was the bottled conditioned Shepherd Neame 1698, as the vast majority of the time when you find British beer in Europe they will be pasteurised, even if in Britain they would be bottle or cask conditioned.

As I expected, Björk gets a bit bolder with her experimentation in her second solo album Post; it's the kind of album that isn't afraid to juxtapose techno beats and trip-hop atmospherics with, say, a big-band jazz number ("It's Oh So Quiet"). Neither Debut nor Post, though, could quite prepare me for Homogenic, which goes deeper and darker with its electronic sonorities, and features the Icelandic pop princess sounding positively angry in some of these cuts, sporting a snarl that is an embodiment of "Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." I'm impressed more than moved, to be honest, but I found it still intriguing enough to soldier on in exploring Björk's discography.

We mistake our online interactions as intimacy, when they are, in fact, much closer to the fancrush you feel for your favourite celebrity. True networking is a two-way street. What is important is connecting with other people. You have to listen as well as broadcast. Ultimately, which platform you use doesn’t matter. It is a personal choice, like wearing a hat. You have to find the one that fits best — tuque, beret, stetson or bowler. (Mine is a propeller beanie.)

This is a challenging and complex area, but that is not a reason for funders to shy away from it. Charities can make a crucial difference in this area—charities like Family Action, whose Building Bridges project helps families with multiple and complex problems. Helping these families to tackle problems early can prevent a generation of children growing up to face the same problems their parents have. The potential for a positive impact is huge.
Today I picked up my German driver’s license, or as it’s know here, my Führerschein. I guess that makes me an official Führer here. Being Texan certainly has its advantages here. I didn’t have to do anything for my license – no test, no driving hours, and I’m not only allowed to drive cars here, but 18 wheelers, too. Go, Texas! Had I ever switched to a California license during my time there, I would have had to dish out over 2,000 Euros (approximately $3,000 in this day and age) to get this baby. And the best part? It never expires! Which is more than I can say for my desire to work at my current job.

The book explores a number of ideas of anarchy. Amongst these is the practical utopianism of Colin Ward and Paul Goodman, two inventive, creative subversives whose reflections on education, squatting, urban design, gardening and a whole host of other issues continues to inspire community-action groups. Ward, in particular, took his lead from Kropotkin, whose critique of the state (in The State its Historic Role and Mutual Aid) pointed to the possibilities of co-operation, local initiative and the development of non-hierarchical organisations. Not quite the big society. Practical anarchy not only by-passes government, it also develops its own moral rules and it challenges market-capitalism.
All of which goes to the heart of what’s often left out of studies of satisfaction and well-being: what has been dubbed a personal issue is really a political one. Maybe instead of kvetching about who’s happier than whom, what we ought to be talking about is changes in workplace structures and public policy.

One of the people we met had overpaid their mortgage…she told us that some months she double paid in order to take care of the loan quicker. But she moved and got a new mortgage and after closing didn’t realize she had sent an extra check. The company sent the money to her old address but, since she had moved, the check went back to the company. They turned it over to us after a small amount of time and now we will give it to her. This was more than $2,000!
Fred never stopped looking at her or let go of her hand. “It’s not a performance. It’s just a meeting of friends,” he said. He moved his hand from her wrist to her palm and extended his other hand to me. I took it, and then put my hand around her free hand. His hand was warm, hers was cool, and we bowed our heads, and closed our eyes, and I heard Deb’s voice calling out for the grace of God. What is grace? I’m not certain; all I know is that my heart felt like a spike, and then, in that room, it opened and felt like an umbrella. I had never prayed like that before, ever. I had always been a great prayer, a powerful one, but only fitfully, only out of guilt, only when fear and desperation drove me to it… and it hit me, right then, with my eyes closed, that this was the moment Fred Rogers–Mister Rogers–had been leading me to from the moment he answered the door of his apartment in his bathrobe and asked me about Old Rabbit. Once upon a time, you see, I lost something, and prayed to get it back, but when I lost it the second time, I didn’t, and now this was it, the missing word, the unuttered promise, the prayer I’d been waiting to say a very long time.

Maverick House Publishers offers two distinct lists; an Irish one and an international one.

Deliberately blocking access to the serving counter always strikes me as a highly selfish and antisocial practice. It can’t be much fun either sitting or standing there with other customers constantly jostling you, passing pints over your shoulder and potentially spilling them over your head. If there’s a very long bar counter, it might be tolerable for part of its length, but where space is limited surely pubs should encourage people to move away once they have been served to make room for others. It’s also very offputting to walk into a strange pub and find an unbroken screen of people blocking your way to the bar – often when the rest of the pub is deserted.
I’d all but forgotten the beer existed until seeing the film “This is England” on TV. The presumably authentic representation of the 1980’s had many characters necking cans of Holsten Pils as an iconic 80’s brand. When a four pack turned up half price, I was only ever going to remind myself of the beer.

Children grow into adults and parents begin to age. If the parents did a good enough job, the children become strong, loving parents in their own right. It is an evolving process. The parents also evolve. As illustrated in Greek mythology by the riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, humans start on four legs in the morning, walk on two legs in the mid-day, and end on three legs in the evening. With each stage they become weaker.

Recommend? Yes, I would definitely recommend this book. Many people would like this story, but people who like mystery and horror will LOVE this book. This was my first mystery/horror combination read and I thought it was amazing! I am extremely happy to have chosen this book because it was a real kicker for me to delve into reading a new genre!

Oh South, what is it with you and your weak-ass coffee? Why are you playing me like this? Even Cafe Du Monde--shame on you, former chicory haven--presented me with a pale drink as milky as an opal. Hot shops, truck stops, cafes, homes, hotels, motels, dives and fancy restaurants: uniformly pallid brew.

This week sponsor is E.A.D. stickers and can I say I love these stickers!! Wow the quality is really amazing. Sorry my picture didn't turn out so good. I flipped the sketch this time and used this cutie bird, branch and hello from my sticker sheet. the friend part I stamped from papertrey ink's ":friend's,til the end" set. I used basic grey's "olivia" paper again!! I love this line! The velvet ribbon is from an old making memories line. So there you have it. Get on over to Get Sketchy and play along this week.
Almost as a joke, he started saying it was the longest-running solo comedy show in London’s West End. Then he realised that, in fact, it probably was.
So, I went to the Egyptian Tea Room, and hookah parlor, to play their open mic with the two brothers. It was an interesting place and a tough crowd to play, but not a bad deal, all in all. It is a cramped space to play, but I don't think the sound was half bad and we did a far better set than I expected. It was the best I've heard them play, and the best I've done with them.
She helps me with the kids when my sadness overwhelms me to the point I can't face them.
Gabie drives a Mini Cooper. She also works part time as a delivery girl at Pete’s Pizza. One night, Kayla—another delivery girl—goes missing. To her horror, Gabie learns that the supposed kidnapper had asked if the girl in the Mini Cooper was working that night. Gabie can’t move beyond the fact that Kayla’s fate was really meant for her, and she becomes obsessed with finding Kayla. She teams up with Drew, who also works at Pete’s. Together, they set out to prove that Kayla isn’t dead—and to find her before she is.
When Pedigo was a youngster growing up on a ranch in Axtel, his father and uncle, both rodeo men, told many stories about Casey’s legendary adventures. It wasn’t until Pedigo was 21 and competing in the Rodeo Cowboys Association that he got to know Casey, who had retired from rodeo but was still making personal appearances.
So I’m sorry. I’m sorry to each and every one of you who has ever experienced the man at the end of the pew. Dirty looks. Cruel actions. Judgmental hearts.
They offered me a second goat, tan and mischievous, for only $50. She was Mamasan’s daughter, but only half Nigerian dwarf and currently milking. I didn’t feel up to starting with two goats despite my guilt at separating them. The daughter followed us down the road for 100 yards, bleating.
When this was first out at the cinema I paid a good £6 in good faith to see Samuel L. Jackson take on some bloody big crazy sharks. Let’s face it, if anyone can do that, (after Scheider), it’s Sammy L. This is not what I got. My incredulous cry of ‘…the fuck!’ at a particular part of this movie was heard echoing through the theatre and I was seconds away from demanding my money back from someone. Fortunately for all involved, especially my mum who was at that stage fearing a scene, the whole thing picked up and I got carried away with the exciting shark action, and LL Cool J. Instead of curing Alzheimer’s the sharks decide that their time would be much better served in systematically taking down a deep sea science facility and eating a load of people. What could possibly be wrong with that?
Sometimes. Usually when I’m beginning a novel and looking for a way to get into the creative mindset I’ll put music on in the background. I only listen to film scores though. Never songs with lyrics as I find them distracting. My favourite composers are Jerry Goldsmith, Danny Elfman, Carter Burwell and Thomas Newman.

Everyone has heard Ben Franklin’s old saw about Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man happy, healthy, and wise, but that was long ago before electric lights, 100 channels of television and computers. Now we can live a complete life any time of day. Even so, a chunk of natural daylight in my life seems to cheer me up, and the long dark winter months seem to demand my getting out doors and being active for the few minutes even in overcast daylight, or I go into a somber mood. But the critical thing, at least for me, and I think for almost everyone is a good conversation at least once a day, and preferably much more than one.

It’s very easy to judge the people on the bottom if you’ve never been there or were there once and forgot what it’s like. Despair, fear, uncertainty about the next day or week or month, erosion of self-esteem, depression, misery, hopelessness—all these things cripple. They prevent people from thinking logically. They bring the ability to make good, smart, rational decisions to a complete stop. And once you’ve no longer got the ability to make good decisions about your life, nothing good can happen. No catch-phrases or words of encouragement or “tough love” or punishment or any other force can save you once you’ve lost the ability to think for yourself.

This is a working trip, not a vacation, so it will be crammed with events. I promise! I want to be as assessable possible, but because it is a fly and then hit the ground running situation, I won't have time to meet anyone personally or do any tweet-ups. I am sorry.
Whether there was complacency I am not entirely sure but it is often a convenient peg upon which to hang a poor performance. I felt that the performance against Wigan was one of those nights where mentally the players were off-key but not through the arrogance that often manifests as part of complacency but what could be described as fatigue, the adrenalin of the win over Manchester City was fed by the visit to Wolves. Had the Wigan match taken place on the Saturday rather than Monday night, that euphoria might well have remained. As it was, the inevitable low after those highs took a toll on the team.
Obama’s main point is that if he’s left in charge – if he’s re-elected – he will withdraw all American troops by 2014. Once again, we get his reiterated timeline – a timeline he spelled out last year, and that has not changed. So he’s reiterating what we already knew. In primetime.

This new idea got a boost when we decided to just get on a record it in a rough and ready way (16 track machine, home studio, several songs at a time) in a very limited time frame. Bingo! The momentum was back.
We get to the train station and no one’s there. Yet somehow, I refuse to believe we’ve gotten had. Through the grace of God Scott learns we’re at the wrong train station—apparently there are A and B stations with the same name. Our train leaves in 15 minutes but the taxi driver we find says we’re close. It doesn’t seem close enough. The traffic here is as maddening as it is confusing.

Carrie shook her head. Like all women, she was there to object and be convinced. It was for him to brush the doubts away and clear the path if he could.
Additionally, what about due recognition given out to these heroes especially those who reside in Sarawak and Sabah? Remember, those in East Malaysia also played a huge part in the armed forces, a fact strangely unrecognized by the government of the day.
As soon as I had got clear of the town I fell in with a poor woman walking at the same rate with myself and going the same course. Wishing to know the condition of the laboring poor I entered into conversation with her, which I began by enquiries for the path which would lead me to the mountain: and thence proceeded to enquiries into her vocation, condition and circumstances. She told me she was a day laborer at 8 sous or 4d. sterling the day: that she had two children to maintain, and to pay a rent of 30 livres for her house (which would consume the hire of 75 days), that often she could get no employment and of course was without bread. as we had walked together near a mile and she had so far served me as a guide, I gave her, on parting, 24 sous. She burst into tears of gratitude which I could perceive was unfeigned because she was unable to utter a word. She had probably never before received so great an aid. This little attendrissement, with the solitude of my walk, led me into a train of reflections on that unequal division of property which occasions the numberless instances of wretchedness which I had observed in
With the final book now available, I look back at our efforts over the past several years with unabashed pride. Make no mistake: Star Trek: Vanguard was Marco and Dave’s playground; their little slice of the Star Trek universe, in which they hoped to provide added context and new appreciation for the era of the original Star Trek television series. They didn’t have to invite us over to play, but they did, much to our delight. While I’d like to think we brought a few things to the table and held up our end when it counted, the series as a whole reflects the ideas and vision developed by Marco and Dave way back in 2004. I’m pretty sure I speak for Kevin when I say we’re honored to have been part of the fun.
This quarters community above is unique in the sense that it grew behind a superblock which has never took off (another typical Batam business style) – Menara Imperium (Imperium Tower). Do you notice the high tension cables above? They were moved a few hundred meters from the original positions so that Menara Imperium can be built. Not too distinct on the foreground are a few edible plants: cassava, corn, and banana. Yes, as with other similar communities, the illegal quarters in Batam are almost self sufficient.
Voltaire was often in trouble with the powers that be and was exiled to Britain at one point. When his exile seemed imminent again, Émilie suggested that they go to one of her husband’s country estates at Cirey. Claude seems to have liked Voltaire and if not welcoming of his wife’s affair at least accepting of it. Émilie and Voltaire set up a laboratory, accumulated a library and did substantive work during their time here. Émilie came into her own in mathematics and science and began to make a name for herself.

I can't stop crying. Everything reminds me of him. I hate being home. It's so lonely. No one here to protect me or bark at the mail man. I need him back. I beg you, please pray for his return. It's coming up on day 6 and I am just devastated. I don't eat, I hardly sleep- I get chest pains and will hyperventilate having a panic attack having nightmares that he's in danger. I'm writing this as I sob and the tears fall down my face onto my laptop keys. I've never felt this pain. I've never had anyone near me die, but I'm thinking this hollow emptiness in your heart and the gut-wrenching feeling is comparable. I am not undermining death by comparing it with losing a dog, but part of me died when I heard he was missing Friday night. I refused to believe it. I was sure he'd be back after he was done playing and enjoying his freedom. I was sure he'd come to my voice Saturday night. 4 hours later nothing.

It was my birthday on Saturday, I turned 23 which feels so weird, but because I was shooting a commercial for Tuacahn and had rehearsal for twelve hours I was expecting an average day. Well, I should have known that my hotness would figure out how to still make the day special. The cast planned to take me out to eat on our lunch break. When we got to the restaurant who was there waiting for me? My E, with flowers in hand and a huge smile on his face. One of the reasons I love him so much is because he is so rad. He can hold a conversation and entertain even the weirdest of them all--musical theatre people. After lunch he came back with me to rehearsal and waited in the hallway, because no one is allowed in the practice space, for four hours then took me out to dinner. It was a great birthday!

I embossed a piece of mirri-board and painted it all over with gesso and before it fully dried I rubbed some of the paint off to reveal the outlines of the butterflies and then dabbed my PPs over it. I sprayed it with fixative to make sure none of the pastel colour comes off. Another experiment in using PPs that I am pleased with.
They once again prove they can keep up with the big dogs! They were running around those trails like champs. Lola was constantly out front keeping guard for us. Zoe was back and forth. And Minnie oh Minnie. She did very well on some river crossings. It was a big day!

Now there is a new wrinkle. It started with interactive "customer service" menus that require input from my end. Evidently these things can be set up to pick up certain words and that puts you on whatever track to get to the next question on your way through automated hell, trying to speak to a company person about any number of things. Those annoy me as well, as the options offered never seem to quite fit my needs. If it gets too complicated I either hang up in frustration or stick with it until I can confuse it enough so that it connects me to a person.

The Beer Hall was as welcoming as usual with a god smattering of customers considering the weather. We went through the card, including the new Dry Stone Stout and lingering at the wonderful NZPA. Just as well it ran out because it is dangerously drinkable for 6%. The Mushroom soup and a large cheese board sustained us through the day.

Bananas and avocados – simply take a ¼ avocado or ½ banana with you in a Ziploc baggie, a container to mash in, and a spoon for feeding!

The leaves jumped and tumbled on the pavement as she headed down a sidestreet away from the shops. I knew what I was doing was odd but I felt compelled to follow her. As commerce turned to residential the streets started to empty of people. I had to be careful not to be seen. It's exciting to follow someone, don't you think? To be so aware of them, their movements and what is betrayed by them, while they are completely unaware of me. Makes me feel alive.

In 1804, her father having become a merchant, the Coffin family moved to Boston, where Lucretia attended both private & public schools. At 13, she was sent to the Friends’ boarding school at Nine Partners, near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where, after 2 years, she was appointed an assistant teacher without salary. The fact that even experienced women teachers were paid less than half what men received impressed her with “the unequal condition of women,” & made her resolve to claim for herself & her sex “all that an impartial Creator had bestowed” (Hallowell, p 38).
I wrote a short story for Change is in the Wind, the Second Wind Publishing anthology that will be released this spring.

Clive Palmer, Australian millionaire mining magnet and apparent national treasure is a hero. If you haven’t been blessed with the giddy pleasure of having witnessed him on Australia’s nightly news bulletins, he basically just loves calling press conferences and announcing things. Just like Spiderman’s sticky hand juice, and Batman’s cape and lycra fetish, it’s a vital part of his superhero persona. He successfully revealed to us the astonishing revelation that Greenpeace and the Greens are run by the CIA, he’s starting up a rival football federation to counter Lowy’s evil heartless commu-facists. He’s going to rebuild the Titanic, discover the lost city of Atlantis and presumably perform a duet with Gina Rinehart on the ship’s very prow, a premiere of Gina’s latest spoken word piece about the evils of regulating business and the need for Third world slave labour. Celine Dion eat your heart out.

The convergence of storage and Ethernet networking is driving the adoption of 40G and 100G Ethernet in data centers. Traditionally, data is brought into the processor memory space via a PCIe network interface card. However, there is a mismatch of bandwidth between PCIe (x8, Gen3) versus the Ethernet 40G and 100G protocols; with this bandwidth mismatch, PCIe (x8, Gen3) NICs cannot support Ethernet 40G and 100G protocols. This mismatch creates the opportunity for the QPI protocol to be used in networking systems. This adoption of QPI in networking and storage is in addition to HPC.
I had this idea. Well, I can't take the credit for all of the idea, because I first saw it on Pinterest. The thought was to take giant foam panels (designed for insulation, purchased at Home Depot) and cover them in fabric, and affix them to the wall for decoration. We've been looking for something to go towards the top of our walls in the Family Room. It has 20 foot ceilings, with a ledge dividing it about 10 feet up. So, we have some stuff up there, but recently we painted below the ledge red on just that wall, and it's been seeming like it needs something. Additionally, since we put wood floors in, our house is quite echo-y. And we have 4 boys, so echo-y plus loud = crazy town. As much as I try to let them be, there are times when the noise is just too much. SO. I thought this project would be awesome to 1. look good 2. be cheap (ish) and 3. maybe, just maybe soak up some sound.
The oncologist smiled, "There's actually about a litre and a half of fluid there, but we're going to leave half a litre as a buffer and let the thoracic surgeon decide what to do about the more delicate work when you see him on the 8th. The risk isn't great but whenever your poking around the lungs with sharp pointy objects there is always the risk of puncturing and collapsing your lungs and we'd rather let the surgeon take that risk because then there'd be the need for more and immediate surgery."
Needless to say, I was invigorated when I saw the Bed-Stuy Streetscape Project the other day. The existing conditions of the corner of Fulton and New York Avenue are lacking, when it comes to the built environment. As I ride my bike past here everyday on my way into work, I feel that the corner has much more potential than is used.
Now we're ready to put the drawer in. Drumroll please!!!!! Did I mention that we've never done this before? And usually things go wrong at least once or twice per project....

CR:Yes, I am an observer, always have been. Wherever I am, I’m watching, thinking, speculating. It becomes second nature. I keep notebooks handy, but often I just squirrel observations and reflections away in my head. They can be there for years only to pop back up again when I’m writing. To do this, one needs a certain amount of anonymity. I think one of the problems writers face now is being forced into participation, by the pressure to appear and make use of social media.

He rose because He wants to be with me. He rose because He wants to be with you. He rose so that we might rise also. Christ beat death so we could rise too. God wanted an eternal relationship with us so badly that He sent Jesus to be our substitute at His own cost. He sacrificed so we don’t have to. He atoned so we don’t need to. He gave us the Spirit so we can live through it. He beat death so we don’t have to.
But mostly, I’ve been pinning things. Somebody must have heard about my filing system – there are literally file folders containing printouts of things I love, magazine articles, products, recipes in every drawer of my house – and whoever heard about it decided to help a girl out. Part of me loves this site. I can pin anything I find online and then when I decide what I want to do with it (usually nothing) I can quickly revisit, look at it and do nothing with it. I’m not sure how I lived this long without Pinterest.
At some point, we would like to build a small, handicapped accessible two bedroom cottage in our lower yard. This would serve as a guest house, a B&B, and a future home for Charles and me when we are too old to handle the stairs and maintenance on our current house (not that we do too much maintenance anyway). We would eventually live in the little cottage and rent out the bigger house. It is a good plan, but it will take money to make it happen. (Are you seeing a recurring theme here?) At the moment, we have a Community Garden in our lower yard, which is an excellent use of the space!

True conservatives very rarely win elections. Reagan and Thatcher are the exception rather than the rule. Almost all elections are won by people who are close to the centre. So Ancram faded from prominence as the undoubtedly centrist David Cameron rose to prominence in the British Conservative party. Something similar happened in U.S. politics not long afterwards. In the 2008 primaries, American conservatives were very enthusiastic about Fred Thompson. But Fred had little centrist appeal so the GOP nomination went to the very centrist McCain. What Thompson stood for remains of interest, however, and he summarizes that below:
Fly out from SFO day. I couldn’t take this day off because it would put me over the 2 weeks time limit and thus would create all sorts of administrative problems. As a result, I was going to prepare and go from work directly. The good thing is that I could show-off all my hard-core backpacking stuff to my co-workers! Well, they weren’t really impressed.

She & I were changing out some clothes (summer to winter) and memories just flooded my mind of that August night we spent talking to her, calming her fears, and trying to convince her she needed to go the college. She was having second thoughts about going, and really not wanting to leave home AT ALL! Now, As she begins the Spring Semester, she has adjusted and doing awesome! She's happy and loves college life! Her grades were excellent and we are so proud of her!! Oh what a difference a semester makes :)

15) Finally, for now, were the first human architects actually Neanderthals? "Neandertals are stumping for bragging rights as the first builders of mammoth-bone structures, an accomplishment usually attributed to Stone Age people. Humanity’s extinct cousins constructed a large, ring-shaped enclosure out of 116 mammoth bones and tusks at least 44,000 years ago in West Asia," ScienceNews reports. "The bone edifice, which encircles a 40-square-meter area in which mammoths and other animals were butchered, cooked and eaten, served either to keep out cold winds or as a base for a wooden building." Elsewhere: Who was the Archigram of mammoth bones?

These guys from Sydney's institutional brewpub were very informative and great to chat with... the beer was great too! They had the Three Sheets Pale Ale and Old Admiral strong amber ale on tap for the day. The Three Sheets was great- not too overpowering in the hop department and a very inoffensive ale- Extremely refreshing. The Old Admiral on the other hand had a good malty backbone to it-would be great by the pint on a cool evening. The brewpub is a great place to check out if you find yourself in Sydney-a great establishment that is a part of Sydney's and Australia's craft brew history.

I moved here from a city that has a train system that is much like a lucky dip – just because the screen says the next train will be the 7:26 doesn’t mean it will show up on time. Or that it will show up. Because it gets to 7:25 and the sign is saying that your train is two minutes away, you think “yeah awesome that’s basically on time!”. Fast forward to 7:28 and it’s still saying it’s two minutes away, there’s no announcements and the platform is full of all the people who just rushed to get the 7:26 who should’ve missed it, had it arrived on time at 7:27.

guy’s Catholicism is so conservative that he’s been endorsed by the evangelicals, including the wonderful Mike Huckabee (just be thankful he isn’t running to, though maybe if Santorum gets the nomination he’ll put him on the ticket as VP). Santorum is so “pro-life,” he’s not just against abortion – he believes that sex is wrong if it doesn’t lead to children. Believe me, people, this guy makes Pope Ratzinger look like a dangerously radical liberation theologian. Santorum can best be described as the American equivalent of Ahmadinejad.
In fact, I feel absolutely out of control. Subconsciously, I know that this is a dangerous thing, what I’m doing. I am well aware that it— if taken too far— can be the death of me. But that’s the problem right there: I can honestly say that I don’t care.

It was interesting to discover that the bean seeds that were started in the moist paper towel sprouted (and grew) much better than the seeds that were planted in the soil. (One of only three sprouting in soil is shown to the right, on the very right hand side of the cup... somehow, some grass seed made it into our bean plants, as well)! Our beans planted in soil were actually a disappointment - perhaps due to the size of the cup? Or cheap soil? I'm not sure which! There are only a few beans sprouting that were planted in soil... but hopefully, they're just slower to sprout!
Nonetheless, wish our baby girl - our MIRACLE baby, Ellyotte - a happy first birthday.

This film uses Dunbar’s own method: Barnard has actors re-enact parts of The Arbor and, even more effectively and intimately, lip-sync recorded interviews with Dunbar’s family, especially her damaged, mixed-race daughter Lorraine. In the end The Arbor is exactly the right film about Dunbar’s life, using her gifts and her legacy, both the good and the very, very bad. No manual on mothering, this; it’s grim but clear-eyed in its portraits of the long shadow of addiction and bad choices to the poor. It’s remarkable — no matter how little you feel like watching a grueling tale like I’ve described, you’ll be amazed and impressed with Barnard’s terrific film. It’s not often you see theater transferred to film so gorgeously.
For a generation that has grown up watching the Pontings, the Kallises and the Tendulkars; it is hard to imagine what Sunil Manohar Gavaskar meant to the cricketing world. He was India’s first great batsman; the first man who inspired a nation to dream big and believe that they could rub shoulders with the giants of the game. He was one of the greatest opening batsmen the game has ever seen; with a game built around a near flawless technique and unprecedented levels of concentration. But most importantly, he was the only man who stood up against the phenomenal might of the West Indies in the 70s and 80s. Against what is arguably the “Best Team to Have Ever Played Test Cricket”, Gavaskar scored 2749 runs at 65 with 13 centuries.

The thing is, I’d take responsibility for the demise of my marriage and my lack of self-awareness if my then-husband had – oh, I don’t know – shared any of his feelings with me. Seriously. This is an aspect of my post-divorce life that I’ve had to come to terms with: Given his lack of honesty, my primary responsibility in the end is to acknowledge my own naivete in trusting his words/expressions/cues/affection.

Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone; And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith: That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto. For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know. For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.
It’s something I never really considered before, but thinking back I know my bulimia started at a time when I was desperately angry and had no way to express it. I was forced into treatment for anorexia at 17, at a time when I was in no way ready for it. The ‘therapy’ I received was awful, bordering on mentally abusive, and although I understood that my parents were making me go because they loved me and didn’t want me to die I was furious with them. I didn’t want to recover from anorexia. Twisted as it sounds, it gave me an amount of self-respect that I had never felt before – I was proud of myself, despite how miserable I was.

“A Wrinkle in Time,” the first in a trilogy that was later extended to include two more books, also defied the norm. Though a major crossover success with boys as well (with more than 10 million copies sold to date), the book has especially won over young girls. And it usually reaches them at a particularly pivotal moment of pre-adolescence when they are actively seeking to define themselves, their ambitions and place in the world. “Part of what made it seem so liberating to so many girls is that it allowed those with an analytic mind and an interest in the pursuit of science to read about a subject that at the time was not perceived of as a suitable course of study for girls,” said Leonard Marcus, author of a biography of L’Engle, “Searching for Madeleine,” to be published this fall. “At the same time, at its core it’s about a girl’s love for her father, and that emotional level transcends the genre aspect of the book.” “A Wrinkle in Time” follows three children as they cross the barriers of time and space via something called a tesseract. On a “dark and stormy night,” Mrs Whatsis (whose honorifics appeared, also mysteriously, without periods), a celestial being disguised as an old woman, visits Meg, her mother and her younger brother Charles Wallace. Soon Meg and Charles Wallace, a prodigy of some sort (today he might be labeled Aspergian), and Calvin O’Keefe, a high school boy, are tesseracting across the universe in search of Meg’s father. They encounter at various points Mrs Who and Mrs Which, who, along with Mrs Whatsis, are also enigmatic star creatures. But it is Meg, a girl who combines both the ordinary and the extraordinary, who overcomes the book’s villain — an evil disembodied brain called IT — with the power of a simple human emotion, love. Perhaps it is this softer element that distinguishes “Wrinkle” from its rocketry and light-saber brethren. But that doesn’t make the book any less weighty or challenging. In her introduction to a 2007 edition, Anna Quindlen, an enthusiast since childhood, confessed, “The truth is, I’m not a fan of science fiction, and my math and physics gene has always been weak.”

The argument that Iran is a terror sponsoring state is also hollow. The world knows the creators of Taliban and Al-Qaeda; stretching the reasoning a bit far, dictators like Saddam Hussein, Muammar Gaddafi and Hosni Mubarak and others, including financially supporting terror crucibles like Pakistan, are the playthings/grounds of the ‘rest-of-the world’ and not Iran. Thus, painting a purposefully bad picture of Iran and using the same against it in the global arena to garner support and buy legitimacy so as to corner it – for Oil, what else?! - is going to be highly detrimental for the world order.

But if there's one thing I should've figured out by now, it's that the forecast here is never right. The forecast will change drastically throughout the day and still manage to be off. They predicted snow yesterday, but said there would be little to no new accumulation. I'd say there were a good 4 inches of snow piled up out there during the day and it was still snowing hard when we went to bed. The forecast (which, of course, may or may not be accurate) is also calling for another 2-4 inches of accumulation tonight. I'm hoping that the chance of rain and above freezing temperatures predicted for later in the week don't pan out. I'd really like to spend Christmas day building a snowman and sledding.

When I spoke to my mom that afternoon, I learned that my daughter had gotten well enough to check into school later that morning. When I picked her up from school, she had a bag filled with cards and snacks given to her by friends who had remembered her birthday. She had a big smile on her face. Mary had interceded for us! God had answered our prayers and turned the day around for her despite the very rocky start.
She sounds like a powerful and fairly enlightened female ruler in the mould of Catherine the Great or or own Elizabeth I, holding her own in a male-dominated society. Good for her, though it seems a stretch to regard her as the incarnation of female wisdom rather than as a successful political leader.

Nurse Meme made sweet tea, but hers did not taste like the cold liquid gold she poured. I was convinced it was the jar that made the tea taste so good. She laughed and told me of course it was all the while smiling out the window admiring her water softener.

Not too long ago I finally got around to purging my iTunes library of a ton of music he had put on there that I had never liked – a lot of international rap and hiphop, primarily, and Asian pop sung in tinny little voices – and I felt sort of liberated – but it was interesting to me how much of the music I still like, that I would have chosen “for my own” – the Vietnamese ballads, all the 60s stuff, just about everything Arabic or Turkish, for example. I do look at his blog. I shouldn’t, but I do. Sometimes I even download the music. Sometimes I can’t fathom why on earth he would enthuse over a particular album or group: Deerhoof? Really? But even now I still experience much of the music he promotes as “ours.” It’s a bittersweet soundtrack for me now, of course, but it’s part of me. He should, I think, write at least a little more deeply and descriptively about the music he posts there. He has the chops - or used to. He tends instead though to put up a

When you use the term “dramatic enlightenment experiences,” you are talking about Nirvana, (2) you are talking about the unity of all with One. It is not to say that you will not experience that, but you cannot — well, you can if you wish; if it is the choice to simply remain in that state of unity, of One — but you cannot be fully conscious and in service, in action, if that is where you are.

I felt that I had to do this review because of the upcoming movie One Da the book of which is by David Nicholls who is also adapting the book for the screen. I read One Day and of course instantly fell in love so I had to see what else he’d written. Most known for his screenwriting, he has done Tess of the D’Urbervilles, Cold Feet and Much Ado about Nothing. He’s written three novels, One Day, Starter for 10 and The Understudy. All of these have had screenplays written for them and Starter for 10 and One Day have both been made into films.
Mind the description of the polenta for how much water you need. For the medium grain polenta we chose (it’ s with herbs, from Globus) we are advised to use 0.75l of water. I recommend to take a little more, so the polenta is viscid. We used 0.9l, which turned out perfect. Heat up the water until it boils. Cut the aubergine into slices and put salt on each slice. After 2 minutes, the Aubergine will have released some of its water (and bitterness). Remove the water with a tissue and repeat the procedure on the other side. then cut the aubergine into cubes. Cut the other vegetables into cubes as well (except oignons). Cut the oignon into small pieces.

They do still have some means to find a frontier soldier gallery, rodeo gallery and cowboy gallery, as well steady home value prices fallen drastically. There has been spared by the mangum oklahoma history, and was followed, at game's end, by one of the oklahoma history topics and the oklahoma history topics on average. The same home will set you back roughly $145,000 in Tulsa.
I woke up late, as usual, and was leaving my house at 8 AM (the time I'm supposed to be at work, sitting in my cube, doing worky type things). I just happened to see the note sticking out of my purse, so I decided to call on the way to work.

Unlike Timothy, which takes a bit of care to get established, Orchardgrass often finds its own way into pastures and hayfields. Propogating both by seeds and by tillers that spread from its dense, clumped bases, Orchardgrass competes well with other grasses and weeds as it seeks new soil. As its name implies, Orchardgrass is tolerant to shade (surviving even in less than 40% sun) and thus can be found commonly between trees in orchards or woods as long as they are not overly dense.
The priest then called the three of us to come up to the altar. His homily, or message, that day was about families. About the love within families, and how we could also consider our fellow parishioners as family. He asked us our names, our baby’s name (“Hi, my name’s Rocco. Wanna fight?” he then said), and how old he was. He then asked the other church-goers that day which of them would welcome us into their home.
That a Leftist party can give birth to conservative thinking is probably most clearly seen in the Australian case. Neville Wran, a Queen's Counsel of working class origins, was Labor party Premier of Australia's most populous state (New South Wales) from 1976 to 1986 and during his tenure introduced his party to conservatism (though not under that name of course). The electoral success of his approach was noted on the Federal level and was put into practice on the Federal level with the accession to power of Bob Hawke. Prior to his career in Parliament, Hawke was known as the king of compromises in the field of disputes between unions and business. As Prime Minster (1983-1981) he of course continued that approach and was in addition remarkably pragmatic on economic matters -- largely traceable, no doubt, to his degree in economics. It was he who initiated large scale privatizations of government enterprises in Australia -- very much akin to what Margaret Thatcher did in England.
We worked on more patterns, each with plenty of set ups, and she did just as I asked. There were a couple times where she wasn't placing her feet where I asked, but with a loud "EH" she corrected herself. She got a cookie after each set up and as the session wore on, chewed them up when they were given to her.
I suspect we are.
If it was a movie, I'd want my two hours back. Instead, I'm just going to pour it out and be glad I didn't have to buy more than one of them, and them I'm going to go take a shower. Although I don't know if I'll ever feel clean again.

It seems to be in possible to go out for a meal with the family and not end up having dessert, which inevitably leads to a little extra going on, even if I've been on track the rest of the week.

Like everything Jesus offers, peace is not just for me. I began to remember watching other godly women as they faced trials covered in the peace of Christ. When a 50 year old wife buried her husband six months shy of her daughter’s high school graduation, she had peace. She lost her husband but, not her mind. I also saw a devoted wife of over 50 years care for her sick husband until he passed. At the home going service her sigh contained a mixture of sadness and relief as she spoke softly saying “my work here is finished”. She had peace. I had spent the last few months caring for some ideals that had died. I had to bury some other false hopes. I had lost some things, people, and direction. In the midst of it all, I was moving forward. I had peace.
When told the haunted Peranakan house was given a 10 out of 10 in a local mag’s scare-o-meter, and how the entire event is listed in an American travel website as one of the Top 10 in the world this year, she felt proud that she played a role in this inaugural horror festival.
These fixtures took me way too long to find. I saw plenty I liked, but they cost much more than I wanted to spend. I finally ended up at Arcadian Lighting. Their prices were by far the lowest I found, and so far the quality of the fixtures seems very good. And I think our house looks pretty happy with itself, don't you?

Preparations are taking place across DUMBO for the Creator's Project, an art and technology festival that takes place on October 15 and 16th.The event includes numerous installations, music, film screenings and panels. (Above: "Origin" by United Visual Artists is going up in the Tobacco Warehouse. Opening October 12th before the main event.)
I was raised Catholic. Absolution found in confession, penance, contrition and it sounds so simple. Confess your sins, act sorry for them and perform an act of contrition. Contrition takes away the sin and its consequences. Doesn’t it seem too easy? Can there really be confession, if there’s no one to hear it? Penitence if there’s no one to forgive it?
I have little to no faith in our government. If we want things to change for the better, whether they be environmental or social or economical, the private sector must do it, must turn the tide and create such an uproar the government may finally act. Unfortunately, I don't have enough money to buy politicians and get stuff done sooner. All I have is this blog. This post. Some anger, confusion, and sadness. Sometimes it gets me hoping through writing, but not today. I am so disheartened. As I will be again, I'm sure. I'm going to go start some liatris seeds.

So, if you look at the Register of Companies at this present time you will notice that Entri is no longer listed as a Director or Shareholder, even though he is plainly listed in the official CIDB website as a director (above).
This poster I got from the Echo Park Time Travel Mart. I have a few prints of Amy Martin's stuff and I really like her work--the colors in this print also match the color scheme of our living room. Also, it's about fire, which is HILARIOUS to me because we're hanging it over our fireplace. (I'm easily amused.) The frame I got from Target, I "matted" it myself by just buying a piece of white posterboard and taping the poster on there before cramming it into the frame. Whatever, it looks fine. TAKE THAT, PROFESSIONAL FRAMERS.
I made my first photo booth for my sister's vow renewal and learned serveral things in doing so...
2) Uplift Africans in general, and African Americans in particular, in an ongoing effort to completely undo four hundred years of euro intervention in the Dark Continent and all sports of pesky disparate outcomes ever since (while all along of course willfully silencing key dark facts about Africa, such as the fact that afros were not in the Stone Age when Javier Dos Santos from Portugal showed up 400 years ago - they were in the Stick Age FFS. To be conferred with "Stone Age" status, a group of people has to at least have The Wheel, which Africans did not have four hundred years ago) (Native Americans, also, never invented the wheel) ;

And when finally consensus is reached, it ties into the largest ‘dynamic core’ within the brain, which is what many researchers think makes something conscious. And then even if an insight was picked up originally by a relatively insignificant part of the brain, it is amplified by the collective in a string of echoes, coordinated by the organ known as the thalmus (the brain’s ‘traffic cop’ and microphone), until the insight that wins the voting is carried like anyone who says ‘mic check!’ and is able to convince others to repeat their words.
Boy, did I have a way of playing up my guild. Sometimes I wonder if I should have gone into a career in advertisement.

Alexa came to Hawaii from Texas. She owned the house on the side of the Koolau Mountain Range in Palolo looking out over the sea where the two ladies lived. She talked with a slow Texas drawl. When I visited she would tell me of the husbands she had. She had three of them. All oil men and all of them from Texas. The first husband was an oil man and worked as a drill leader. He was the best darn drill lead out of Odessa Texas. He was a real working man and stronger than you could imagine. Her second husband owned a small oil import company. With the second husband in the late 1940’s, she lived in Saudi Arabia for four years. She observed the local dress code and didn’t care to drive anyway. What else was the driver for? She came to Hawaii with her third husband when he retired. He passed away a little over five years ago.

Mancala- Both Jared and I play this game with Emma (not at the same time-it's a 2 player game) Emma requires very little help. I suggested she try playing this game on her own, which she loves to do.
You guessed right – that Najib’s position. The PM-cum-finance minister has just crafted a munificent Budget that says if he has selected Idris Jala as his numbers man, he has not taken heed of him, particularly his warnings about the mounting threat of insolvency to national finances.
Hullo everyone. I'm back with part ni of my Mega #towatchpile update. For this post I'm going to go through some of the horror films (dodgy or otherwise) that I've been watching. Please bear in mind that I'm using the term "horror" quite loosely. That means that I'm including the zomedies and anything else that contains horror themes.
Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the loaf is risen, golden brown adn a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean. Allow to cool in the tin for 10 minutes before removing to a wire rack to finish cooling completely. Store in an airtight container.
When the Gala ended (way too early), I went with Luciana to Food Fight for Upton's pop up sandwich shop. I had the second best sandwich of my life there: chicken seitan, grilled eggplant, chipotle aioli on a delightful focaccia. So good! Then this lady randomly pulls up in an ice cream truck and offers us samples of coconut lemon saffron ice cream. BEST. THING. EVER. And the weird thing is that she had never, ever stopped her truck there before. This is why I love Portland.
The great thing about this movie is the personal dilemmas the characters face. Each one is emotionally distraught in the present and can’t fix it using conventional means. They’re completely believable and well thought-out. The downfalls of this movie are probably felt only by someone like me, who loves the 80s. There weren’t enough references to the present time and most jokes were about the past in relation to the present (like what they can invent using their knowledge) instead of being confused as to what was available at the time and what wasn’t. That part of unavailability was represented probably by the nephew character, but he didn’t seem to get enough screen time.
Early on I met Angus Fox who showed me an iPhone app that he’s developed for Surrey Police. It must have taken ages to come up with a name for the app: Surrey Police. It let’s front-line staff communicate directly with the public via social media, and helps to make it quick and easy for them to do so. It’s just being piloted in one area at the moment, but will be extended to cover the whole of Surrey later in the year.

Richard Cobb and Beunka Adams robbed a store and took three hostages, two women and one man. They drove the hostages to a field where one woman and one man were shot. The man tragically died from his injuries. The women survived.

Yes, he has endorsed Mitt Romney for president, though his expression when he does so has all the spontaneous pleasure of the star of a hostage tape. He cites President Barack Obama’s failure to work the levers of power to accomplish change–intriguingly, he contrasts Obama not with a Republican president, but with Bill Clinton–and Romney’s understanding of the free market and job creation. (Huntsman was animated in scorning Republican candidates who called for a hard line on China or protective tariffs–notions that Romney has enthusiastically embraced.)
There are 146 FFA chapters currently participating in this year’s Chapter Challenge, a pilot competition sponsored by Monsanto that is open to chapters in in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, Georgia and Alabama and started March 7. The competition challenges FFA members to connect with local farmers in their communities, learn about their operations and connect them to their FFA chapter. In turn, farmers are asked to vote for their favorite FFA chapter online before May 1.
Five years ago today one of the most precious beings I’ve had the pleasure of sharing life with passed away from an enlarged heart & cancer of the spleen. None of us were surprised when he was diagnosed with an enlarged heart for he gave such love to everyone he met, even his vets. We were told to take him home and spoil him rotten. He had two weeks. That lasted nine months. He had to have his stomach drained of fluid every two weeks. He let them do so with no fuss. He was BB’s brother via adoption. He was a stray. They told me on the phone before we went to rescue him that he was “funny looking.” Humans are vile. He was beautiful. Inside and out. Today Micky would have been 16.
This is a short list where trans actors of different types have played trans characters. I have not included professional gender impersonators here. A much longer list from Vesta Tilly to Julian Eltinge to RuPaul could be created, but that is not what this list is about. Nor, with one or two exceptions, does this list include documentaries, not trans actors in cis roles.
“I’d like to go back to school.” Gingerly, I opened the topic with my husband after a particularly joyous evening of play and bedtime rituals with our children.
In a 5-quart saucepan, add the 2 tablespoons of butter along with the olive oil over high heat; add turtle meat. Cook stirring until the meat is brown. Add onions, celery, green pepper, garlic, green onion and seasonings. Lower heat to medium and cook until the vegetables are tender.
NOTE: If you live in a test market (such as San Diego, where I live) then I'm so sorry to tell you that Wednesday was the last day of the 40% off sale. In test markets, the weekly sales start on Thursdays instead of Sundays but, for everyone else, you have until this Saturday night to see if your Rite Aid has the Balm Stain display out so you can grab some at a fantastic price.
Every year it amazes me how quickly everything grows under the midnight sun. I can notice the difference with my naked eye just by looking at plants in the morning and later at the same plants in the afternoon.

Well, it opens with Yahiro hiding out in an attic with his cancerous brother, Jun. That is, until GHQ forces raid the house (it’s apparently a nunnery) and under threats of violence from Segai (AKA Scarface) discover their hiding place. But of course, they’ve just escaped.

Almost a perfect example of the "new" traditionalist, Scot's designs are informed by classic styles but are fit for modern day. Getting a start with Ralph Lauren Polo, Scot learned a lot about design, space planning, and styling ... building rooms with different themes, styles, and aesthetics - and oddly enough, it's how he got his start in designing for his own clients.
“My folks won’t be back until later tonight”, she volunteered for no reason. “Perfect, then we have plenty of time.” My horns were beginning to show.
I think the time off had the desired effect: I freed myself from the pressure I was putting on myself to post however often. The tank that was empty is slowly-but-surely refilling.

These cards feature black borders on the front surrounded by a white frame with a full color photo inside. The players name and team are located along the bottom.

Definitely suggest a smock as acrylic paints stain pretty well. I have to note this was not a favorite project of mine. The soda bottle's edges are sharp and a parent definitely needs to do the cutting and assembly, so I didn't feel it was kid centered enough. :-(
But, we've stretched the Consitution and its intent well beyond anything the drafters could have considered in the late eighteenth century. It is my belief that the Westboro Baptist Church has intended all along to take advantage of the American preoccupation with preserving First Amendment rights, that they want to be martyred in the public eye, that the whole reason they've carried their 'protests' to these funerals is in the hope that someone would lose their temper and attack them. I think their conduct demonstrates this, as is evidenced by this from Time:
Jerry Katz started what may be called “popular” nonduality. That is, he took the teaching of nonduality out of the ashrams, out of university departments of philosophy and religion, out of scriptures, out of the hands of gurus, and put it on the common sidewalks where anyone and everyone could access it freely.
