øThe Xbox 360 version ships on three discs - two for the single-player game and one for multiplayer - which might also be a drag for some. (The PlayStation 3 version fits the entire game on its higher-capacity Blu-ray disc). There are random graphical oddities, too, a helmet, for instance, sometimes appears to be floating on the ground after it's shot off an enemy's head. And why do fallen weapons disappear after two seconds when enemies stay on the ground? It doesn't make sense to spend so much effort to create a realistic world with incredible graphics when these little things break the immersion.

Shaelee, my goddaughter, loved jigsaw puzzles. Her mom, Susie, and I are best friends, and our daughters -- our only children -- have been best friends since they were 5. Susie and I would often find our girls in Shaelee's bedroom, lying on the floor, working puzzles together. Their little brows furrowed in concentration, their attention would center on a hole in the picture, and their fingers would move piece after piece trying to find the right fit.

» Diana Munter had one of the tallest tasks in kindergarten -- 10 of her 19 students come from homes where Spanish is the primary language. Munter, whose mother spoke only Spanish, used her bilingual skills to her advantage, dishing out instructions and correction in both languages when necessary. Her greatest challenge, though, wasn't her English learners. It was a cadre of four boys whose behavior sometimes stretched the limits of believability (one boy stood up in front of his classmates and purposely wet his pants). At times, it was hard to see the progress amid the turmoil. But in the end, 18 of her 19 students were ready for first grade, including her English learners.

On the issues, Smith, a 48-year-old grandfather of six from East Garfield Park, is a decidedly more mainstream and cautious Democrat. He ran unsuccessfully for Cook County commissioner in 2010 while working as a deputy director in the Secretary of State's office.
A few Lodi winemakers do produce classically structured reds with enough acid and tannin to give the wine a real backbone. Cosentino falls squarely into that camp, although it turns out that Cosentino is actually a Napa winery with a single Lodi vineyard and a Lodi tasting room. It also turns out that Cigarzin doesn't have enough Lodi fruit to be designated as a Lodi wine, so my entire Lodi mission was the result of a dumb error during that first Google search. But by the time I realized this, while smacking my lips over Cosentino's fantastic Cabernet Franc, it hardly mattered.

Early on, the dying King Alfred and his son Edward call upon Uhtred to unite the Saxon lands against their common enemy. But why? Uhtred wonders. "Why ally myself to a man destined to fail?" he says, thinking of Alfred.

The Maloofs said the so-called "term sheet" had other elements they didn't like, either. To make the point, their attorneys filed dozens of requests under the Public Records Act for copies of all communications related to the arena talks among all parties involved: the Kings, the city, the NBA, AEG, the railyard owner, Goldman Sachs, the city's sports and parking consultants, the arena development team, and who knows, maybe even the birthers, truthers, Holocaust deniers and New World Order types.

Best Value Pick: Johnson is a physically gifted edge rusher whose on-field production at Virginia never matched his athletic prowess because of poor instincts and a hot-and-cold motor.

Wallace says the Mavericks are not doing anything differently defensively than any of the teams the Blazers faced down the stretch, but rather he just can't find a "rhythm." Wide open shots aren't falling. Forced drives to the basket aren't helping. The solution has been unattainable.

In a large bowl, combine the asparagus, peppers, mushrooms, grapeseed oil and garlic. Toss together until the veggies are completely coated.

* The Rams were abysmal on third downs against the Bengals, converting 2 of 13. And both conversions came in the 4th quarter. The Rams netted seven total yards on their 13 third-down plays. The misfires continued a terrible trend. The Rams are 32nd (last) in the NFL in third-down success rate at 26.9 percent. How bad is that? Since STATS LLC began keeping track of third-down rankings in 1991, only eight NFL teams have converted less than 26.9 percent.

"The more disciplined we've become, the more strident the demands upon our finances have become," Paisley said. On top of gas prices, he has had to deal with storm damage to his car, broken appliances and roof problems.

He later proved that a sexy, soulful singer could sing political material as well. “What's Going On,” Gaye's landmark 1971 album, abandoned Motown's feel-good “Hitsville U.S.A.” formula in favor of lushly orchestrated yet hard-hitting tunes about civil rights, the Vietnam War, the environment and other pressing issues. Gaye died April 1, 1984, on the eve of his 45th birthday, when he was gunned down by his father in the wake of a heated argument.

In addition, PG&E has asked the utilities commission to approve spending $2.2 billion more to improve its natural-gas system, with about 90 percent of that money coming from customers' monthly bills.

Defying gravity: In a provocative essay, ABC's Amy Walter notes that while President Barack Obama's approval ratings aren't great (48 percent on average, according to Pollster.com), they are rather remarkable when you consider that in some surveys, barely a quarter of Americans say the country's headed in the right direction. How long, she wonders, can people hold these apparently inconsistent thoughts?

Bardem is effortlessly charming and nicely commanding (in what, in romantic dramas, is typically a thankless, objectified role). In fact, all the male performers are very good.

But “Country Strong,” sadly, includes everything on the best-actress checklist except a performance — unless you consider two hours of Paltrow alternating between drunken crying jags and wan country warbling something more than a privileged star showing off.
But what really ate at her, and me, in our discussion afterward was the film's overall cliche portrayal of sex work -- the inability to have "real" relationships, the self-worthlessness and even a crazily non-ironic confession-in-a-closet scene between the film's two sex workers. While we saw things that reflected many aspects of our rich San Francisco sex culture in this very New York film, the icon of the broken-yet-articulate hipster sex worker was clearly not part of our city's values. Note that this wasn't a sex worker onscreen as a sex slave, which is clearly nonconsensual and in every city, but the articulate white hipster kind of sex worker, of which there are plenty in San Francisco. Yet our own hipster sex workers are by and large very vocal about their self-empowering, shame-eradicating, health-promoting viewpoints.

Not for him were the better known stories of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Dali's oedipal issues, for example, were filtered through the beloved fable of William Tell, the legendary 14th century crossbow marksman who inspired the Swiss rebellion against Hapsburg domination when he was forced to shoot an apple from the top of his son's head or be executed. Instead of heroic, Tell's actions to Dali were instances of paternal domination, mirroring the artist's tortuous relationship with his own father.
In Pakistan, al Qaeda’s leadership is under more pressure than at any point since 2001. Their leaders and operatives are being removed from the battlefield. Their safe-havens are shrinking. And we have sent a message from the Afghan border to the Arabian Peninsula to all parts of the globe: we will not relent, we will not waver, and we will defeat you.

A lower credit rating could ripple through the U.S. economy and ultimately hurt consumers. That's because many loans, including mortgages, tend to follow yields on U.S. Treasury bonds. So interest rates could rise.
The SEC has suggested a preliminary plan in which bilked customers could receive payments, possibly ranging from $20,000 to $250,000. It calls for the payments to be tied to the value of customers' accounts in their final falsified statements.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates bee pollination increases crop values nationally by $15 billion a year. Oregon growers say yields would drop by 70 percent in some cases without the pollination work of bees. Oregon blueberry farmers alone require about 25,000 hives annually, trucked into fields during a short spring pollination period.
Baltimore's Department of Public Works, which provides water to approximately 411,000 accounts in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, has about three dozen of those workers who manually read the meters. Hampered by bad weather (the blizzards of 2010) and inaccessible locations — about 17,000 meters have either been paved over or are inside homes — workers fell behind in their readings, which are supposed to be taken once every three months. So the department began estimating bills, sometimes with wildly inaccurate results.
The rise in unemployed immigrants also follows the implementation of the Arizona Legal Workers Act, which penalizes employers who knowingly hire undocumented immigrants.
"When I was a kid, my grandmother made guava jelly," said Burr. "I want the next generation to have the same memories."

Carpenter had the biggest hit of the inning -- the one that knocked Gallardo out of the game. He drilled a double to dead center that scored two runs. Milwaukee center fielder Nyjer Morgan paused and took a step in as Carpenter's ball soared to him and then over him and to the wall.
For once, I'm proven right. We plow through to the top, head back down the east side of the peak, and soon enough it's a sloppy snow and then just rain.
It's written by a white playwright, Philadelphia-based Thomas Gibbons, and is played by a multiracial cast. More important, it doesn't settle for easy answers about who we are - white, black and in-between - or where we come from.
Who thought the NFL would ever see the day when Indianapolis would cut the No. 1 quarterback of his era and Manning would become the most hotly debated free agent in league history, with a single, coldhearted business decision by Colts owner Jim Irsay?
Obama has been criticized in the past by some, particularly Republicans, for suggesting Israel cede territory back to Palestine in pursuit of a two-state solution to their on-going conflicts. The president was also criticized for publicly urging Israel to return to negotiations with Palestine.

Still, the U.S. Department of Labor estimates released Tuesday suggest that the state's job market did make progress last year. Maryland employers had 24,700 more workers on their payrolls in December than they did a year earlier, compared with a 4,400-job gain in 2010 and a 67,000-job loss in 2009, when the recession officially ended.
The cuts are likely just a sample of what's in store next year from Republicans if Mitt Romney wins the White House and the GOP takes back the Senate. Romney promises much tougher cuts to domestic programs and an even bigger boost in the Pentagon's budget, while the House GOP budget promises sharp cuts to Medicaid and a dramatic overhaul of Medicare for future beneficiaries.

With Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin locked in at the top two selections and Texas A&M's Ryan Tannehill stirring up a lot of discussion as a top 10 pick in the 2012 NFL Draft, who will be the next quarterback to go?
Dear Margo: I have been friends with a woman for many years. A few years ago, she had an affair with a man in her office. When her husband found out, she ended the affair -- for a while. Last year, she left her husband and began a new life with the other man. (I suspect he'd stayed in her life the whole time.) Her children have always been great kids, but now they're having difficulties in school and are disrespectful and unhappy. I think they don't like the situation, but they also don't like this new man. I don't either. Should I express my concerns that her "new life" could be permanently affecting her children, as well as damaging her relationship with them? She seems to feel like the sun rises and sets with this guy. — Watching on the Sidelines

Carnahan said the emergence of larger, more efficient turbines have opened up markets like the southeast that have been bypassed by the wind industry.
Advocates of the practice refer to scientific reviews that discount the risk to human health. A 2004 paper in the Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy argued that cross-contamination between farm animals and people is a two-way street, with most antibiotic-resistant disease stemming from human use of these drugs. In any event, the authors wrote, illness from bacteria on meat can be prevented with proper cooking — even if the bacteria are resistant to drugs.
Mizzou is second in the nation in field-goal shooting at 50.4 percent. That fact, and the way MU has done it, moved Stewart to recall the 1979-80 team that made 57.2 percent - still the major-college season record and one not likely to be broken since it was set before the 3-point shot came into play.
The 51-year-old Petrino, who is married with four children, later acknowledged Dorrell was present, saying he was only trying to "protect my family and a previous inappropriate relationship from becoming public."

Tension marked the back-and-fourth match, which ended with heavy sighs when Japan won on penalty kicks. But then there was appreciative applause among many gathered.
Such progress puts the lie to the contention that gains on state tests are illusory. What happened is that kids scored steadily better on the exams so increasing numbers were counted as passing. Then the state raised the passing mark, so some kids fell below the bar even though they had done better.
CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Tucked inside the Bible that Alonzo Gee reads almost daily is a sheet of paper his mother handed him in the summer of 2009, the year all 30 teams passed on the Cavaliers swingman in the NBA Draft.
Some dishes were sloppily executed, such as the bountiful johnnycakes ($9.75) drizzled with lime cream and pepper relish; their flavor was good, but they weren't cooked through.

The Fancy Fizz, $14, at the W Scottsdale Hotel & Residences is a refreshing combination of Chardonnay and Chandon Brut, with hints of citrus and a drop of simple syrup for sweetness.

“Rebecca’s lacrosse skills have been reflected on the scoreboard. Despite the losses, she always manages to average three goals a game and also assists others.

We have said from the beginning of this acrimonious discussion that Ohio's collective bargaining laws for public employees -- pushed through a Democrat-run legislature and signed by a very pro-labor Gov. Richard F. Celeste in 1983 -- should be changed to reflect new economic realities and to give state and local officials greater management flexibility. Ending the strict rule, now enshrined in Ohio law, that schools must use seniority in determining layoffs would, on its own, be a huge help to urban school districts that are betting on innovative schools -- often staffed by relatively new, creative teachers -- to lift student performance. That's the kind of reform that Mayor Frank Jackson, new Cleveland schools CEO Eric Gordon and backers of the district's transformation plan want and need.
Tony's take: Bengals in a rare laugher. Bengals 24, Colts 0.
He ran through $154,494,445 (pronounced, "Holy moly, more than a hundred-and-a-half million bucks.") in salary from the 76ers. That took lots of partying, lots of posse members, and big lots of diamond-encrusted jewelry, personal hair stylists and other assorted perks that NBA superstars enjoy at the expense of common sense.
The workers were motivated in part by New York’s crazy benefits for public workers. As the feds note, LIRR workers hired before 1988 can retire at the “relatively young” age of 50 and get MTA benefits, something that “no other commuter railroad in the United States offers.” But the workers couldn’t get their federal railroad pension until age 65 -- so they resorted to fraud.
With typical theatrical flair, Count Basie Theatre CEO Numa Saisselin likened the Hope Concert to Brigadoon -- an apparition of collective goodwill that comes to Red Bank every few years. Monday's show was the fifth in the series; the most recent, the legendary 2008 Hope Concert IV, paired Bon Jovi with the Boss. Bruce Springsteen had been a regular "surprise" guest at Hope Concerts past, and many at the Count Basie were openly wishing for a return engagement by the one Jersey rock star whose popularity trumps Jon Bon Jovi's.

20% Theatre Company's production is a bleak and caustic coming-of-age story. Lily, a girl who never fit in in her small, working-class Massachusetts town, is home from college for a visit. Hanging out with her cousin Tony, his girlfriend Franky and a couple of buddies, she seems at first to fall effortlessly back into the rhythms of life in this dead-end town. However, fissures appear as her new perspectives clash with her past and she's forced to question everything from her relationships with her family to her sexuality to her place in the world.

On finishing a book: "I send the book to New York to be read by my agent. I picture them on a train, and my heart is broken. I mean, I'm thinking of how they're sort of limited people or shy people, and they're just so brave to be going up there on their own. It's really anthropomorphic. But then, after they get accepted, so to speak, and they're a book on their own, I'm like a mother cat with kittens. I never think about them again. They're gone."

And for the bride who likes a little drama, there are swirls of orbiting variegated lily grass circling white cymbidium orchids on the next bouquet.

Emperor Menilek II (1844-1913) united the separate kingdoms of modern Ethiopia in 1889 and thwarted an Italian invasion in 1896. He modernized his country by introducing banking, a postal system, railway, electricity, telephones, telegraphs and automobiles.

Boy, that 2005 national runner-up has to feel like eons ago for Bruce Weber. After a 15-3 start, the Illini have gone 1-6 in their last seven and the school’s AD dodged a chance to give his head coach a vote of confidence over the weekend.
But on Thursday, Zanotti said members of the group's public engagement committee determined "that we're better off running the risk of people being reluctant to say something than we are raising concerns that we're making recommendations behind closed doors."

Kalif Alhassan: Midfielder, 19, one season with Timbers. The lightning-quick Alhassan only played in seven games, but he sure made an impact. The midfielder from Ghana is young, athletic and technically skilled, but he is raw and inexperienced. Alhassan's coming out party was his game-winning goal in the Timbers' win at Puerto Rico Sept. 18 and he scored again at Vancouver Oct. 2. Alhassan was the best player on the field during Game 2 of the Timbers' playoff series against the Whitecaps Oct. 10.

Lietzke said it's too early to know if there will be parts shortages on any of the vehicles Honda makes and how long they will last.
Spain's development ministry estimates there are 687,000 unsold new homes for sale. Other studies put the number as high as 1.6 million in the nation of 47 million, where 80 percent of the population already lives in owned homes, a rate much higher than nations like France, Germany, Italy and the United States. There is no government figure for used homes for sale, but estimates range into the millions.

The Wus use no trans-fats or MSG, for example, in their cooking. They eschew peanut oil, which can trigger allergies for some, for vegetable oil. And they plan to give the option of brown rice (a whole grain) a trial run at the restaurant. It’s not widely offered at other Chinese restaurants, so if it proves popular enough, they’ll add it to the menu as a regular option.
Now Dent and Askia are among scores of prisoners across the country who are being released early — the beneficiaries of efforts to change those sentencing guidelines that critics say disproportionately affected low-income people and minorities who faced longer prison terms for crack-cocaine charges. Some authorities, however, warn that potentially dangerous criminals with records of violence also could be released.
Hey, Tony: I like how the Browns have been building through the draft. I do think we need more playmakers on both sides of the ball. Which positions do we address with our two first-round picks next year? -- Cy Falter, Pickerington
Aldridge had a nice run at the end of the second quarter, however, when he swished a turnaround 16-foot jumper, made a jump hook in the lane and hit a 19-foot jumper, scoring six of the Blazers' final eight points of the half. But his night went south after the mini-run.
"On the injury side, no news is good news, and that's not the way it's been," Colangelo said. "You take two out of your potential 12 and they go down and they're out, that's a blow no matter what. The important thing now is to focus on who would be, what would the makeup be of a roster."

But the committee called it "astonishing" that Rupert and James Murdoch took so long to find out that phone hacking went far beyond a lone reporter, Clive Goodman, who was briefly jailed in 2007 for hacking into the cellphones of aides to the royal family. Police say the cellphones of thousands of people — celebrities, athletes, politicians, even the relatives of fallen soldiers — may have been hacked by the News of the World in its pursuit of sensational stories.

The tipping point was an interview reporter Patrick O'Donnell had with Nate Mueller, a 17-year-old junior who was nicked in the ear by one of the shots, saw the flash from the gun and watched his former friend shoot three students he'd been sitting with just moments before. That is about as solid as information gets.
Window Rock simply did not have an answer for Bradley Nash and company during the match. Monument Valley scored nine of the final 10 points scored in the first game, with three consecutive kills-two by McKara Kescoli and one by Ty'lesha Yellowhair - closing the game.
For the moment, the U.S. is the sole superpower. But instead of deluding ourselves that we will go on that way into the indeterminate future, an intelligently self-interested foreign policy would have us do everything in our power to shape, according to our most urgent priorities, the international rules that will govern relations between states after the American moment has passed -- as it inevitably will.
Gee said that while OSU "stumbled out of the gate" in handling the scandal, that it finished "very well." He reiterated his strong support for Smith, as he once pledged to Jim Tressel.

Granite City is scheduled to play host to Highland (11-2) on Wednesday afternoon.
"The factual basis for the sanctions is quite strong in my opinion," she said. "You must safeguard the identity of people that provide information to you in order to protect them, and also to encourage others in the future to come forward with evidence of wrongdoing. This is certainly not a one-on-one, he-said, she-said record at all. This is multiple independent sources."
This is, in a nutshell, the book's dynamic: one know-it-all lording it over another, who's just trying to keep up. The narrator, enthralled by Wade's superior chops, will never be contented. It's a sad story, because we're allowed to see through Wade's low-grade megalomania while the narrator isn't. But along the way, we're treated to the musical reflections, reminiscences and judgments that the narrator has woven into some sort of personality, however inadequate, and these are as interesting as they are hopeless.
Although flavored products look "benign," Sorensen warned they're as addictive as regular cigarettes. As part of the movement against flavored tobacco, she has talked to public officials in several Volusia cities, including Port Orange, which has passed a resolution asking businesses to quit selling it. Kissimmee, St. Cloud and Lake Mary have also passed resolutions.
For rambunctious boys, you can't do better than "Shark vs. Train" by Chris Barton, illustrated by Tom Lichtenheld (Little, Brown: $16.99, ages 3-7). A raucous game of one-upmanship, the book asks "Who will win?" in an escalating series of contests between the super-powerful shark and the ever-popular train. Who wins at roasting marshmallows? Train — shark's too wet! Who'd attract more kids as a carnival ride? You're kidding, right? Even boys stuck in the pirate stage will get this.

Among female artists who discovered a surrealist mirror in Mexico's burnished landscapes and matriarchal indigenous societies were Alice Rahon, who joined the surrealists in Paris in 1931 but later moved to Mexico City; Carrington, an England native who fled Europe after her then-lover Ernst was captured and sent to an internment camp (triggering Carrington's mental breakdown); and Olga Costa, a German who resettled in Mexico and married painter-muralist José Chávez Morado.
"There has been no evidence of bias nor evidence of intimidation," wrote the lawyers, Steven Altman and Philip Nettl, who represented Ravi at trial.

And when it appeared it did not have enough votes to clear the Senate, Kasich began lobbying senators individually in private meetings in his office. He eventually helped get the measure the one-vote margin it needed to clear the Senate. The more conservative House was an easier sell.

A redesigned 2013 Accord hits dealerships this fall. It remains under wraps, but Honda foreshadowed it in January with the Accord coupe concept. The redesign will be smaller and lighter, Honda says, with a host of crash-avoidance technology and a reprisal of the Accord Hybrid. The competition, however, is fiercer than ever. Honda needs to make up lost ground in a lot of areas to retain owners like LeBlanc and pick up some new ones.

Gleeson said the 45-minute indoctrination to MLS play will help Tuesday night.
The Sun misses the broader economic implications the tax would have on residents who are already heavily assessed. Higher taxes curb economic activity as fewer hard-working families are able to purchase needed goods and services. How much more can citizens take in a city where the median household income is $39,000 a year? Ratcheting up taxes on individuals and organizations that employ local people will end up destroying jobs when the unemployment is already more than 9 percent.

Notes: Rattie, who leads the league in playoff scoring with 17 goals and 13 assists, remains questionable for tonight’s game with an undisclosed injury that he sustained in the third period of Game 1 and kept him out of Game 2. “It’s really day-to-day right now,” Johnston said. “He’ll get a little bit of a workout here today, and then we’ll make a decision tomorrow.” … Graham Kendrick, Portland’s director of media and public relations, said the Winterhawks were seated at the back of the plane, the Oil Kings sat up front, and both teams were on their best behavior during Saturday morning’s charter flight from Edmonton to Portland. The Winterhawks will be seated in the front of the plane during the return flight to Edmonton following Tuesday night’s Game 4.

The downside of facebook is that I think too many people believe what they see on it. I've read plenty of postings that were only half true or were completely wrong. That's why I think traditional news media is still relevant and desperately needed. We are trained professionals. We know what we are doing. (ok, maybe not all the time) We can investigate claims, cut through the spin, and just give you the facts. Consider this, police departments and local governments are posting a lot on facebook. They are only going to post what they want you to hear. You think they're going to post bad news? I don't think so. You still need people like us to ask the tough questions, get answers, and then pass it onto you so you can get the real story.
A rule-of-thumb is purchasing a long-term care policy isn't worth it for those with relatively few assets, say, less than $250,000. Odds are they'll eventually turn to Medicaid if necessary. People with more than $2 million in assets have the financial means to self-insure. But rules of thumb are only a starting place for research. Look at your full financial picture -- assets, income, and expenses.

Sure, things are different outside of San Francisco, but it rang true in so many ways through the lens of "Shortbus." It's a very New York film, punctuated by a few unforgettable emotional jolts that serve as a reminder of Sept. 11 and how it lives on in the characters' emotions. In San Francisco, our emotional punctuation would come from our over 5,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS in 1994-1998 -- only a taste of our particularly horrible, enduring and ongoing tragedy. And yes, it affects the way we all have sex -- and the sex culture, or "otherness" of culture that draws so many different kinds of people to San Francisco.

It turns out that the coffeecake post was Prudent Baby's top post of 2011 (thanks to links to it by, among others, an online group for pot smokers who were psyched about a 5-minute cure for the munchies). Cofounder Jaime Morrison Curtis, who came up with the cinnamon-flavored cake as an alternative to chocolate cake-in-a-cup recipes, recognized its appeal right away.

No, no, no. At this point, the more games the Cavs win the worst their chances in the lottery. Right now they have the fourth worst win total in the league at 20-41, tied with Sacramento. Charlotte and Washington have the Nos. 1 and 2 spots wrapped up, but Cleveland, Sacramento and New Orleans are battling it out for No. 3, and with four of the Cavs final five games against teams that were in the playoffs as of Wednesday night, the Cavs have a real shot at it.

It's not a flattering picture that emerges: Evangelicals influenced more by partisan impulses than teachings of their faith when it comes to the crucial moral issue of torture. Yes, we all want to be safe. But aren't these the folks who have been shouting from the rooftops that America needs to be guided, first and foremost, by Christian virtue?

Our primarily two-party system makes it all so simple: Democrat vs. Republican. We're fairly forced into throwing our entire selves into one of those two boxes. Perhaps we even change ourselves so we can fit into them. I always vote Democrat. That's not because I agree with everything on the Democratic platform. It's just that I agree with most everything. For this reason, I sometimes find my values to be inconsistent.

Shanahan, who suspended Shaw for three games Tuesday, seems to fit in both categories. The Hawks were without Shaw for Game 3 Tuesday night, and wherever you fall on the law-and-order spectrum, that made some sense. He had hit Smith behind the Phoenix net in Game 2 and received a major penalty and a game misconduct for charging the goalie. There would have to be a reckoning.

It’s some time in the distant past in the verdant forest of Sherwood, and the peaceful, well-behaved citizens of the area have been taxed up to the teeth by the greedy sheriff (Kevin-Michael Moore creates a delectably funny squawking, strutting cartoon character). There’s a thumb tax (everyone knows thumbs are a luxury), a brass tax, which is really hard on musicians, an egg tax and a chicken tax: No one knows which came first.

Perversely, a bad season for the Cubs is good for out-of-towners who crave a taste of excess. In 2010, April's hopes had turned bitter by August, and that led to steep discounting of rooftop admissions, with those $150 tariffs whittled by half or more. One building's operator ended the summer by declaring bankruptcy.

Meanwhile, he says he loves his teammates and loves the fans of Portland, but that too sounds wishy-washy. If he truly loves his teammates, he wouldn't hold them hostage wondering whether he will be there in mind and body come the Oct. 26 season opener against Phoenix. After all, nothing says "I love you" like preparing all preseason with a certain rotation, only to bail at the last minute in order to make a selfish stand.

Nick gets a call that Dimitri's car has been found abandoned near a warehouse in Linnton, which is enjoying a spectacularly foggy day. Sgt. Franco greets Nick and Hank with "Welcome to paradise." The detectives investigate inside the warehouse. They see blood on the floor, markings on the wall and, as Hank puts it, "weird-ass symbols on the floor." Nick notices the lettering looks Latin. It's some kind of arena, they deduce. And those medieval-type weapons aren't a good sign, either. "And," Hank wonders, "who the hell speaks Latin?"

That means no Alabama cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick, ‘Bama linebacker Dont’a Hightower and North Carolina defensive end Quintin Coples. These are names who have been tied to the Giants but are projected by most to be gone before No. 32. Though I have a tendency to imagine scenarios where players slide to the Giants or the team trades up to get one, I’m going to resist that urge here. While I was surprised some personnel types from other teams didn’t tell me it was crazy Kirkpatrick could slide to the Giants, I’m not allowing myself to believe that one. He’s too good to last that long, shaky workouts and interviews or not.

He kept doing that until all eight parts were on one disc.

Last week I wrote a post about keeping in touch via social media, and how real relationships and connections can be strengthened that way. My outlook might have sounded unabashedly optimistic, but I don't want to leave out the other side of the story. Not the side of the story the media usually covers--I'm not talking about how people can get sucked into infidelity, addiction, and pornography online, although all of that is real and appalling. I'm talking about the side of human relationships and of church life that can be neither replicated nor replaced by social media. In our everyday relationships we might think of it as a human touch. In our church life we call it the sacraments.

During our early years, we were subconsciously aware and reassured that there was someone in our lives, so close, that she knew where we were.

Through this care and awareness we gradually learned to take responsibility for ourselves.
Danny Knobler, CBSSports.com: "The Orioles and Red Sox didn't play the best game in baseball history Sunday at Fenway Park. I'm not even sure it was the wildest game ever. But it might have been the most incredible. If not for you, then for Chris Davis. He was the Orioles' designated hitter, but he didn't hit. He's not a pitcher, but he did pitch. He had the worst day ever -- and also the best. He became the first player ever to strike out in each of his first five trips to the plate, and then hit into a double play. And then he became the first guy to start a game as a DH and end it as the winning pitcher. And the first guy to go 0-for-8 in a game he pitched in since 1920. And the first guy to go 0-for-8 in a game where he was the winning pitcher since Rube Waddell in 1905."

I wonder if Spencer would ever consider trying a 4-2-3-1 (defensive mids: Chara/Jewsbury, attacking mids: Songo'o/Nagbe/Alexander). A lot of teams are using it with success in MLS and around the world. It seems that while Jewsbury has potentially lost a step offensively, he is still very good as a ground distributor and midfield defender. If Songo'o is EVER match fit and ready to start, that could be the best way to get all our best players on the field in a formation that plays to everyone's strengths. If Spencer is set on 4-4-2, he could also try a 4-4-1-1 with the same players, putting Nagbe behind Boyd instead of beside him.
