Düsseldorf, 1 March 1929, the dying days of the Weimar Republic. A prostitute is found dead in a cheap hotel room, brutally murdered. But her death is soon forgotten as the city’s police hunt a maniac attacking innocent women and children. A killer the press has dubbed the Düsseldorf Ripper.
After explaining that his auctions will offer fresh-to-market material rather than his inventory, “and that is refreshing,” he immediately added, “I don’t want to imply that everyone else doesn’t do that refreshing thing.” When asked why he is holding the sale in Connecticut, he mentioned the antiques stores in downtown Stamford that could use some publicity and his suburban customers’ possible distaste for Manhattan hotel and parking rates, but then added, “Can you say that without ... ,” and trailed off. “I love New York,” he said. “I don’t want to hurt anybody. My curse is that I want to make everybody happy. It’s a curse.”
And LGBT activists weren’t the only people outraged by Harris — child advocates in the state condemned his remarks.
Life Itself, Ebert's low key description of his remarkable life has been in my car's cd player for several weeks now and I feel as if he's sitting next to me in the seat. Such an enjoyable companion! I make up errands so that I can spend more time with him. At the risk of sounding egotistical, I think that part of the attraction is that he reminds me of myself in many ways. No drama! He's a full throated optimist without an ounce of bitterness about his current illness and situation.
14. DON’T DO DRUGS — If I have to hear one more person talk about how they got their ideas from getting high or drunk, I’m going to scream. You’re not original, smart, clever, or creative. You’re an addict. Get help and stop wasting space.

I would love to feel sorry for her -- and I guess I do -- but you know what? Heffa, please. You're a mom. You made the decision to have sex. You made the decision to keep the baby. I'm sorry your man isn't there for you. Honey, I've been there. I've lived it. It sucks and it's hard. But you know what? There's so much more to being a mother than just co-parenting with someone else. You can't let the sperm donor's involvement, or lack there of, be reflected on how YOU feel for your baby. That's just eleventy billion sorts of wrong. It's not fair that he doesn't help you out. HE sucks at life. But your baby doesn't deserve a mother who says she made the wrong decision in NOT HAVING AN ABORTION. I'm petty sure my head is going to explode! And I consider myself to be politically pro-choice!
Heaven.

You snuggle up under the blankets and wish you could sleep in. But then the alarm rings, and you get ready for work. The traffic is heavier than usual because of the rain. You feel like you're freezing your ass off in the office, because of the rain.

Jaipur is an exciting, vibrant city to explore - very much the typical Indian city I had envisioned when we were planning our trip. Not quite as huge and overwhelming as Delhi, the population is only 3 million people, ﻿Jaipur was by far my favourite stop in India.
I couldn’t begin to understand why I might be hearing from elements of nature. They didn’t seem to be nature spirits like, for example, the personified spirits of plants that appear in Carlos Castaneda’s work. The only purpose I could imagine was that they were intended to shore up my physical structure. If there was any purpose at all. Did Orion send them to me? Did I bring them in on my own?

Sadly, Eve Carson was to pay a high price for the diversity she sought to celebrate and promote, in the same week that we in Britain saw the conviction of Karl Taylor for the murder of Kate Beagley America was horrified by violent deaths of two beautiful female students, in circumstances so similar that some in the press initially speculated as to whether the two crimes were linked. One of those two young women was Eve Carson, the other was 18 year old Auburn University student Lauren Burke, both women had been shot, and both appeared to have been the victims of car-jackings.

Here is my description of God. He is the beauty in the colors of the trees in the Spring and in the Fall. He is the breath-taking scenery when you ride through the mountains. God is the breath-taking moment as you watch the sunrise or sunset over the ocean and hear the songs of nature around you. I look at myself in the mirror, I look at my family and others around me and I see God.

"What can I do?" Well, he could start by not picking up women in the parking lots of out-of-the-way motels, inviting them to dinner, and feeling up their magnificent, thrusting charms while dancing.
The Talker is old and gaunt. By his looks, it’s unclear if he’s entering old age early, or is already old and holding onto a wirey middle aged body. His thinness and dry, wrinkled skin hints at current or past drug abuse. His dark grey handle bar mustache is accentuated by the blue bandana that always covers his forehead. Today he went on about Oedipus. “You ever heard of this guy Oedipus from Greek mythology? He was this guy that killed his father and married his mother.” The Talker barely stopped for a response. ”What kind of sicko does a thing like that? I mean c’mon.” He was as loud and abrasive as ever, despite going on about a subject that didn’t warrant the assumed volume and intensity. As he went on about Oedipus, I began to recognize he had many of his facts wrong from the original myth, despite getting the just of the story.
It turned out the deal with Quill was the best deal in the world. I could order letter size paper, ink for my printer and many other essential office things so cheap they seemed almost free. Oh, and shipping was complimentary.

On one of the very few Xmas anthems with a fight sequence (there's one in the little-heard fourth verse of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen," too), Joel Hodgson and the robots remind us that Road House can have ye olde yuletide spirit, too. I missed this during the Xmas song round up of 2009 somehow.

Tom and I also cracked open a bottle each of the bitter and the lager that we brewed in class. Both had carbed up pretty well and should be good for Friday's final tasting/food pairing. Each could use a little longer to optimize, but we're dealing with a tight schedule.
However, Kathy soon began to play out her betrayal dramas. In our classes, there was never quite enough work to go around for all the teachers. Each teacher would have his or her “turf”; classes they considered their property. Other teachers were not supposed to teach turf classes unless there was so much work to go around that the “owner” would say, “OK, you go ahead and teach that section.”

For music, my only option is a hand-me-down lamb that my Boy Cousins used to sleep to, which plays Mary Had A Little Lamb with a wind-up key. Babby already enjoys this music box, although it’s a little sprightly for sleepy time. However, PH is worried about it because the toy is over 20 years old and has metal turn-key. It doesn’t look super safe for a tiny baby. Better for a slightly older child who doesn’t poke himself in the eye when trying to put something in his mouth.
Satyamev Jayate is very well researched and well grounded in terms of numbers and figures. Aamir surely has double-checked his homework. He also broght along two audacious journalists,Meena Sharma and Shripal Shaktawat from Rajasthan,who had conducted a sting operation seven years back in clinics and hospitals across India on the barbaric cases of infanticide, bringing to the actual front the real faces of the doctors that were involved ,who can just for some amount of money, kill the child in the womb. The cases are still lying open in Rajasthan court and has been divided to different sub-divisional courts and since years the accused doctors have their licenses intact and they are continuing with their practices.

All during 2011, I enjoyed a free digital subscription to the New York Times courtesy of Lincoln and as a reward for being an online reader for a decade. When it came time to continue the subscription, they offered me 8 weeks for 99¢. Naturally that was too good to resist so I signed up with the intention I would take their 8 weeks and cancel the subscription. I marked the date on my calendar. The only way to cancel was to call and speak with a person. I took this as a plus since automated systems make me crazy. The representative was helpful and cancelled my subscription and even sent me an email confirming the cancellation. A few days later I received my bank statement and found on the day I called to cancel, they dinged my debit card for a three month subscription. I don’t know if they are using this tactic with others or if this was a random occurrence, but it left the impression they may not be getting the renewal rates they hoped for. Sadly, it also diminished my opinion of the once great New York Times.

This was before I had really got into baking or cake decorating in a big way and was struggling to think of something I could make - especially as pretty much the only rule was "no fondant!". In the end I turned to a cookery book that I had recently been given - the Hummingbird Bakery's Cookbook - and realised that I had never actually made their namesake cake. I was also pretty unsure what a hummingbird cake would turn out like, since it contains pineapple, nuts, and bananas (I hate bananas!) - I have to admit I prefer chocolate cakes or ones without banana at least and I thought that making it for the cake club was a good idea, because if I didn't like it, I wouldn't have to eat it!
That doesn’t mean I avoid messing around with burgers and trying to come up with new delicious ways to eat them. I love trying to make new stuff (very eloquent, Pete). So, while I will address the perfect traditional burger and the famous Dupee burger at another time, let’s kick off this new post category with the burger we made in Naples, FL last week: The Wellington Burger.

The good part of this is that I discovered Sarah Langan through this. I also picked up a surprisingly well written horror/adventure novel about Bigfoot (check out Dark Woods by JC Kumar). On the other hand, I discovered some of those wretched compost heaps that actually served to make me feel much better about myself as a writer. Quite a few of them, actually.
Hang on a second, you took nothingness, gave the universe creation, then life, then the life you gave the universe is now judged as being good or bad and so you punish it accordingly with heaven or hell? Are you doing this shit with the tigers or the moths or the algae? I fucking hope so God! (They care less, they aint aware of this shit.) So far all I can see is you existed out of nothing, created everything and then decided you would stop making stars and rocks and atmospheres, and instead create conscious beings, who could feel pain and love, and then you decided to make them suffer in life, then judge them in death and sometimes send them to burn in hell because they were, I dunno, gay. What the fuck? What is your problem God?

Whichever way we face these new challenges, I believe we need community. Whether that means a loyal and monogamous relationship with a publisher, or a team of fellow authors setting out on an e-publishing (or blogging!) venture together - or any number of other possibilities - my point is that, as we travel from one era of publishing to the next, we need each other.

my 1906 home in Kansas City took a lot of work and I lived in the carriage house while improvements where under way. When it came time to move from the carriage house into my newly renovated home, I took a lot of the furniture shown in the "classic style" photos with me to the main house. That gave me the perfect opportunity to recreate the carriage house with a slightly different look which was more modern in sensibility. It was a fun project and I had the carriage house photographed both ways for my website.

It's already hit the three digit temperatures in Dallas, Texas! The hot temps don't bother me though, as summer is my very favorite season, and I am glad it's here! The first three summer compilations contained only songs with the word "summer" in the title, but last year I expanded the song choices to include the words "beach", "surf", and "sun". Please do post a comment with other summer song suggestions that I can use in future compilations. Hope you enjoy this!

I have always wanted to make a fruit tart. The kind that has a thick layer of pastry cream, with fresh fruit arranged beautifully on top. I finally had a chance to make one while my cousin Angie was in town a few weeks ago. On the second night of her visit we invited my mom, my other cousin Yvonne and her fiance Marvin to come over for dinner. Mom cooked up a variety of delicious Chinese dishes, and I made dessert.

After a night of crazy sex, Beyan basically said that if Ben married Courtney *gasp* it would be a big mistake. I mean, come one. Rehearse some more, Beyan. Here’s the speech that closes it. You don’t say “she’s in it to win it”. You say “Look Ben. She’s hot, we get it. She’s an actress sort of and she doesn’t have human feelings and I get how that can be appealing, but here’s the deal. She is an awful person to everyone and even in a group of 20 people, Khadafi would have found 1 fucking friend. I wanted to marry you, but if it isn’t me, at least Sally Field is a nice person and War Horse knows how to ride horses and her parents do weird shit like make you pull them around in chariots. That’s hilarious.”

Earlier this month, I purchased my first four plays and begin this new endeavor. I picked four that I perceive to be easier; Much Ado About Nothing, The Comedy of Errors, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and The Merry Wives of Windsor. I am hoping to get through them a little quicker so that I can build up a little bit of a buffer for when other priorities move this down the list. As of right now, I am 14 pages away from finishing my first one, Much Ado About Nothing, about an entire week early.
Lastly, you can even lose your miracle because of words. Remember in Luke 1 the High Priest Zechariah was made mute by the Angel because he didn’t believe the word of the Lord concerning the birth of John the Baptist? (Luke 1:19-20) Why did God silence him? I could have been so his words of unbelief wouldn’t sabotage the miracle that was taking place. Remember it’s always better to say nothing that it is to speak negative words that can destroy your future!
For those hoping the rumors about the micro-oxidized ceramic rear are true, well bad news. It’s not. The Samsung Galaxy S III sticks to the same plastic build, only this time it comes in blue or white.

The trailer did a pretty good job of setting up the story. Five people are stuck on an elevator and one’s the devil. But who!? That’s what our attractive, emotionally-burdened detective (Messina) and religious security guy (Vargas) aim to find out. Our choices are: black temp security guard (Woodbine), shifty mattress salesman who gets to have sex with Christina Hendricks (Arend), little old lady (O’Hara), well-dressed young woman (Novakovic), and shady-looking white guy (Marshall-Green). Each has a reason for being on the elevator, but the whys and wherefores spread throughout the entire film.
Hence, the film eventually reveals his alcoholism and his transvestism, in that order, and the result is a documentary that is ultimately a very moving statement about sexual identity, repressive violence and art that is for a fuck of alot more than it's own sake! On every conceivable level, Mark Hogencamp is right to cast his bad guys as Nazis. While only a bit of sensitivity is required to realize that homosexuality and transvestism are not the same thing, such sensitivity would not have been displayed by those busy gasing gays in the ovens along with Jews, Gypsies, Communists...
So God sent the Holy Spirit–the presence of God–to remain in the world with the people of God and to actually live within the people, making their physical bodies into temples. Now, people don’t have to go anywhere to be present with God. No one can keep us away from God or force us to stay at a distance from God’s presence because God is now present inside the human body!
I find it amazing how often you see video game publishers bitching and moaning about used game sales. They make it out to be the worst thing in the history of human kind. In fact, it’s just a way that common people save money.
Change of job- check- pretty much under control. Minor set back yesterday when I realized that the person who has done the job for the last seven years would not be available for three weeks for questions- by then I will already know everything! But the panic subsided as hubby reminded me that it wasn't long ago that I didn't know everything about the job i was doing and I managed to completely rock that one...so this one I am starting with more knowledge.
The chap that did the talking spoke to us about Beetlejuice being ready to go pop at any minute now - in astronomical terms; in people terms, anytime within the next 100,000 years. Destructo Boy was somewhat disturbed by this, as he was quite concerned that we would get sucked into the resulting black hole, like, tomorrow - and then where would we go ? Because no-one has ever been in one before, and what is in there already ? And it might be a bit crowded what with all the rocks and spacedust and things. I think also he was quite downcast that his own destructive abilities are somewhat dwarfed (geddit ? the astronomical pun ?) by a supernova.

Here are a few pictures of some of the wonderful items from some of our amazing sponsors that I have received so far.
I opened the bag to find a blanket with a big clearance sticker on it.
So yes, something may stir inside me causing me to cry tomorrow. While my probable tears for my homeboy will be of joy, there is one that I know that I can’t stop from falling– a remnant of the pain still left inside from a great love that just simply could not go any further.
Check the space under your sink. If you have a cabinet under the sink, it could be a hotspot for cockroaches already. Make sure you keep this area clean all the time. Watch out for signs of infestation such as illustrated eggs. If you see eggs, arrange of them right away to preclude them from hatching.
I finally got the chance to ink up my newest Christmas stamp from LOTV!! She is super cute and I had loads of fun coloring her...specially since I think I'm getting a little better using my new Copics! I've been practicing all week and watching tons of tutorials to get it right...cause I almost thought about giving up, selling my new markers and going back to my Prisma pencils...lol. Also, you will not believe this...I tried many different cardstocks over the week that I had on hand, because some were not allowing me to blend correctly and guess which one works the best for me?? My GP cardstock! It's the cheapest too! I started out with my cardstock from Papertrey Ink and it was just not allowing me to blend very well. The only thing I don't like about the GP is it's pretty thin compared to Papertrey Inks, but it does not tear or feather, so that's a good thing! I'm thinking the GP worked best for me, because it's super smooth!
Morty: What's new, Izzele?
Nobody is going to be preachy, we just want people to know that if they ever have a problem, there will be somebody there who has been through it before who can help.
Because a lot of times now i find myself just serving but not really doing it with love.
It has been reported that several months of mail from constituents are unopened at the council offices, her voicemail is full and e-mails bounce back. Concern has been expressed within her ward that she failed to turn up to the recent Tilbury remembrance service.
Apparently, I fold under this kind of pressure.
Have you given thought to this? How much sacrifice must you make before you placate the guilt at the bottom of your heart, and how much before you present to the world an image that you are not an asshole?

Fresh food is piled high in front of the statues. Pyramids of apples (taped together to keep them from falling), six-packs of bottled water, oranges, and mangos are the most popular. The bodhisattvas are not the only ones enjoying lunchtime: the multitudes enjoying lunch from white styrofoam containers remind me that the map of the site did indicate a cafeteria. Ah yes, there it is. You make an offering and then step up to the window, where the monks dish out a good portion of rice and a ladleful of mild potato & vegetable curry. Just the simple food to go with the calm.
Now that we’ve exposed events to respective views, and defined our setter getter properties, we need to do something in the onAddNote and onEditNote function.
What if what was could still be what wasn’t?
Wilson presented his theory in an essay written with George Kelling in 1982. It came at the dawn of the horrible decade that stretched from the recession of the early Eighties, through the carnage of the crack epidemic and the clusterfuck of racial tension, police brutality, and widespread fear that gripped David Dinkins’s New York in the early Nineties. Murder statistics tell the story: homicides spiked in 1979-1982 and then again in 1990-1994, but have steadily declined ever since.

I am happy that you acknowledged the “possibility” of an alternate life on Procyon. It is a pretty place, and there is a shuttle from earth to there every 48 hours from Catalina Island.
Firstly I have stocked up on jars. In order to minimise my waste water I will keep several jars of different coloured waste water so as not to keep pooring all that paint down the sink when the water goes muggy.

While I’m talking about wasting time, it does me no good to complain about those lost years. My message to you is to find the time in every free moment you have right now, whatever may have occurred before. I’m no less busy today than I was twenty years ago. If I had to guess, I’d say I am even more busy. But I’m also a lot smarter. Over the last two and half years, I’ve completed my second novel one hour a day, at 4:30 in the morning, during lunch breaks, or during the television programs I choose not to turn on. I have just about prepared my manuscript for submittal. The process has taken a lot longer than I had hoped, but chewing off one piece at a time has allowed me to finally
Whether we realize it or not, most of the things we accomplish in life often come as a result of some level of planning and executing that plan. Think about it, if you want to be a nurse, you have to take the steps that will lead you to that profession. You can’t just sit there and expect it to happen, you have to MAKE IT HAPPEN by taking the necessary classes, making sure your grades are ok etc you get the picture. When I started thinking this way, losing weight became so easy and fun. Just like in life, if you want to lose weight, you are most likely to succeed if you can answer two important questions; what is your final destination? And how do you get to that destination? In other words, how much weight do you want to lose and what are you going to do to lose that weight (action plan).
That’s all.

The track’s wide variety of corners make it a severe test of man and machine, which is why it’s a favourite test venue for the teams. Two of the three pre-season tests took place at the Circuit de Catalunya and, between them, Jenson and Lewis have already notched up 3,500km around the track this year.
As they headed down the hall, they passed an orderly who dropped a handful of charts. Kelly bent down to help pick them up. The detective grabbed her arm. “I think he can handle that.”
What about I open up another account that is purely for direct debits only. The time consuming part was ringing up all the companies to advise change of bank details. I worked out how much I had to automatically transfer to our direct debit account every pay day. Now I know exactly how much money is ours to spend on groceries, entertainment etc.
I'm so excited to finally be started here and *cannot* wait to see all of your wonderful creations each and every week. Thanks again for joining us ... I hope you find creativity, inspiration and FUN along the way!

“There have been over 600,000 downloads of the Lightroom 3 public beta, which has supplied us with a huge amount of valuable feedback from a passionate community of professional and advanced amateur photographers,” said Kevin Connor, vice president of product management for Digital Imaging at Adobe. “The open dialog we have with our customers allows us to further improve Lightroom and provide the best tools they need to produce high-quality images. We’re happy to see that so many people are anxiously anticipating the final release, so they can start taking advantage of all the new features they had a hand in developing.”
I laughed at the recent rumpus over guest houses being forced to accept gay couples (assuming they could identify them) because they could simply do what they do with blacks - say they are fully-booked. It's incredibly difficult to prove discrimination. If a white a person is offered a room just a few minutes after a black person was refused, the owner simply says they'd just had a phone call cancelling a booking. You have to show a pattern of refusals over a period of time in order to bring a prosecution.
So I wanted to share a few things I've been working on recently and some of them are already listed in my Etsy shop, along w/a few things I'm not showing yet(hey, didn't want this post to get too long and drawn out, plus it gives you an excuse to go take a peek)LOL.

PRETORIA. Former Minister of Health Manto Tshabalala-Msimang has denied reports that her new job as Minister in the Presidency will be limited to serving double vodka tonics to visiting heads of state and cooking African potato snacks for President Motlanthe.

Samuel Adams Belgian Session is a crisp, bright version of a traditional Belgian beer with fruity, slightly spicy flavors from the Belgian yeast. After many trial batches made from a finicky Belgian yeast, the brewers redefined the typical session beer style, using subtly sweet toffee and caramel notes from a blend of pale and honey malts to harmonize with the yeast's distinct fruity and spicy flavors. By definition, session beers contain no higher than 5% ABV (Belgian Session is 4.3%), allowing the drinker to enjoy multiple beers during a "session."
To finish, and to add opulence, I added lots of decoration using my Perlen Pens in gold and pearl - adding centres to the flowers, some dots along the punched border and a dotted border around the edges of the card. I also added some teeny tiny dots to the image here and there on the jewellery.

A random trip to Taco Bell last week got me thinking. The brood and I needed to waste time between pick up time at the Bigs' school and the start of Girl Scouts. Seeing as I'm already making 2 round trips (VA Beach /Suffolk) every school day til summer vacation, I'm staying in Suffolk in the afternoons when we have scouts in the evenings. I mean c'mon... as it is I'm driving 160 miles per day or 800 miles a week. Well, last Monday, we cleaned up at our old house, did some homework, and then headed to Taco Bell for a quick bite to eat before dropping Julia at Brownies. With Donk in town, I really don't bring all 5 very many places these days.
But, of course, there is the other side to the argument, suggesting that people with epilepsy should not have to live with the fear of death or deal with the inconvenience and invasion of privacy required to be constantly monitored. Surely, though, there is a happy medium. At least, if the risk is clearly understood, a person with epilepsy can live life relatively normally, with extra caution only as warranted in their particular circumstances and in situations where they know they are at greater risk than usual.
Many of us are responding unconsciously (myself included), from old habit and thought patterns without any awareness or understanding that we could create something different in out lives. Many of us have been conditioned into people pleasing and approval seeking behaviour, which in turn limits us from really being our true selves and really loving ourselves.
Atlantis Resources' chief executive Tim Cornelius explained that, " The turbines turn at six to eight revolutions per minute, so are incredibly slow turning and will have zero impact on the surrounding environment." Theoretically, the turbine rotors should not harm marine animals.

2:20: The stern goes vertical and then it too sinks, 2 hours and 20 minutes after Titanic first struck the iceberg. 1,500 people are left stranded in the frigid Atlantic, while 700 people float nearby in lifeboats. They have to wait two hours before the Carpathia arrives at the scene to pick up the first survivors.
Path has this neat go to sleep / wake up option. You hit go to sleep at bedtime and a moon comes up on your screen so you don’t see any updates etc and in the morning you can wake up and it shows you how many hours you slept, adds a tidbit and greatest thing, tells you the local temperature! Okay so you actually need to wake up on Path for all this. I ‘wake up’ on Path at random times during the day just to see how hot it is & its automatically shared, less work, better look.
However, this has been tempered by the fact that within the mainstream unions there has been no similar rank-and-file empowerment. The Sparks are a vital exception, and to be sure there are those of us trying to kick start similar initiatives. But as a general rule, though there is certainly discontent with how the unions are plodding along, there is no real organisation to give it tangible form.
ND - I’m not going to speculate because I thin it would be wrong to do so. We have to deal with any application, any approach by Duff & Phelps to us saying we’ve now got a preferred bidder, here’s the bid, we’re putting in either a CVA and our involvement as the SPL is minimal or there’s, we’re going to pout in an application for a transfer of membership, in the case of the SFA, a transfer of share in the case of the SPL, we’d have to look at it. We’d have a duty to do the right thing by the league overall.

Performance wise, the script gives ample scope and opportunity to its actors and they don’t let us down either. Parambratta Chatterjee is superb as Rana, playing the role with determination,ease and slipping gears between supporting act as well as carrying the film when needed. Siddiqui is excellent as Khan, giving Khan a headstrong veneer and earning the viewer’s grudging respect with his portrayal. Chatterjee is simply brilliant as the contract killer, genuinely exuding a dark menace and pitching the dark humour surrounding his character with perfect precision as well as being a scary character.
So yeah, this weekend I get to challenge my spatial perception by visiting Lubbock. I don't know that I'll be doing much but listening to some papers and drinking beer with my fellow archaeologists. I do know a couple of people up there, so maybe I'll get out and see some stuff (if there's stuff to see). I'm going mainly for networking and to support people I know giving papers. I've been very gung-ho junior exec-type guy lately, partly because I asked for a raise (which I haven't heard anything about yet).

The online business success doesn't mean to necessarily remain in front of the public, and therefore a businessman who is more focused on having a creative company should not be bothered by industries that have a lot of build up surrounding near them.

Apparently my fears of her being traumatized forever were unfounded. And yet again I am reminded that whatever I thought I knew about raising little girls was all wrong. We did, however, decide that this sort of death and destruction - despite being on a miniature scale - was not appropriate viewing for her and we eased her on to "A Bug's Life" instead. Thank goodness for me, because if I had to watch another furry spider wage war I probably would throw up in my mouth a little bit...
People treated for isolated systolic hypertension (a case where the systolic pressure is high, but the diastolic is normal or low) are particularly vulnerable to the harms from over-treatment.17,18 Your well-meaning doctor has been taught by the pharmaceutical companies that it is the duty of every good physician to make patients’ blood pressures normal at all costs, even when the top number is the only one out of range. Two studies have shown that the J-curve applies to isolated systolic hypertension and the risk of strokes, too. The Systolic Hypertension in Elderly Program study found a 14% increase in strokes in those whose diastolic pressure was lowered only by 5 mmHg with medications (starting average of 177/77 mmHg).19 Overall, the research suggests the greatest benefit for stroke prevention is to reduce the diastolic blood pressure no lower than 85 mmHg.17

Simon returns with a three week extension: enough time exactly, with no room for error.
One of the surprises of the evening came with the inclusion of Screaming Trees' "Crawlspace", one of their lesser known tracks as it was officially released only last year on "Last Words: The Final Recordings", the band’s “lost” album (isn’t it time for a Screaming Trees reunion? I for one would pay good money for that). From Lanegan’s '90s solo material, we only got his version of The Leaving Trains' "Creeping Coastline of Lights" (off 1999’s covers album "I'll Take Care of You"), while "One Way Street" and "Resurrection Song" represented 2001’s "Field Songs" (alas no "Don't Forget Me").
She's colored with Copics and Prismas. I used some gorgeous My Mind's Eye papers. It was so hard for me to actually cut into this pad. It's just so beautiful.
I’ve always wanted to write and I kept pages and pages of story-filled notebooks as a kid. Somewhere along the way I got the impression that being an author was not a good goal to shoot for and I put the idea aside. When I became pregnant with my fifth (and last) child, I felt the pen calling to me again and started the juices flowing.
If you received one amongst your 12 ''Beer Box'' beers than you're a lucky recipient. My 5 case allocation lasted no more than 2 days.
I'm thrilled about the series, but what's making me most excited at the moment is rediscovering AI (artificial intelligence) and robotics - subjects that have lain dormant in my brain for several years. Way back... too many years to count... I did an MSc at Edinburgh University in Artificial Intelligence and fell in love with the subject, which surprised me by focusing more on the way humans do things like learning, understanding, language processing, vision, etc, than on the machines. Or maybe that was the aspect I paid most attention to. I soon became sidelined into linguistic semantics and ended up doing a PhD on the subject of 'then'. Honestly. I knew more about 'then', for a while, than most other people on earth. I can see you're impressed (or possibly not...). I do still feel a little glow, however, every time I use the word.

Consequently, when American missiles and bullets tear through villages, rooftops, windshields, and the living, breathing bodies of Afghan men, women, boys and girls, the carnage is devoid of “context” – not that a deadly attack on U.S. soil over a decade ago can possibly, in any conceivable, legal, or human way, justify the atrocities, trauma, terror, dehumanization and devastation that have befallen the Afghan people at the orders and hands of American soldiers, officers, and commanders-in chief.

Recent figures show that only 3,050 children were adopted from the 65,000 in care in 2010 — many of whom could have found happy homes with parents of a different race.
These are just some of the reasons why I loved our visits to toy stores, but the two main reasons I loved them are actually simple: wonder and awe. Every time we went to a toy store, the boys experienced a sense of wonder and awe that you could see, hear, and feel in the air like a bolt of electricity coursing through their spirits.

Well by 1955 or 56 when Cole Porter would have been writing the songs for this film (a musical re-make of "The Philadelphia Story") he could have heard "Rocket 88" and / or "Maybellene" -- (obviously "What'd I Say?" could not have been an influence because it didn't come out until three years later).
We followed the stream until it flowed into the river, easily identifiable by its size, and then we followed the river until it crossed the road leading into town. A short hike down that road, and we arrived at our prearranged pickup location, about an hour ahead of schedule.
As we all sat down to rest, Akido popped out of his story bag to meet the children. He learnt that children in England like chocolate cake, playing Transformers and go to school where they have classrooms and outside space. Akido told the children he likes to play football, to eat pancakes and that his classroom was under the baobab tree.
Jaxon and I are happy to say that we'll be visiting home in a couple weeks! Jake has some training he'll be gone for so Jaxon and I thought we'd take advantage and go visit you all! We'll be home Feb 26- March 6! I am very scared about him getting sick again when we're home so everyone, please try to stay healthy! I am going to be a hand-washing/ sanitizer Nazi when I get there before I let anyone hold him. (I'm sorry, I just don't want him sick again.) I hope we get to see you all and Jaxon finally gets to meet the rest of the family and friends.
I saw this card layout on Pinterest and immediately thought of all the scraps I have saved. Enter this weeks challenge at Come and Get It and the fact that I need some masculine birthday cards in my collection and a card was born! My desk looks like a scrap attack right now, but in a fun and creative way! I'll admit this card was fussy and time consuming, but I was in the mood to get lost in this kind of card.
Anywho, there’s no statue involved, just a little bit of work. There are three things I need to do after accepting this award. It’s sort of like a pay-it-forward thingy.

Now we have Shirley's abusive husband (John W. Jones) or boyfriend or an acquaintance or maybe just some guy who came in off the street, I wasn't paying attention...he comes home, sees her reading to nobody and starts yelling at her then beats her with, among other things, her copy of The New Testament (QUADEAD BOOK! DAMN!), and for as much as I hate violence against women for any reason, this abuse session is so badly done, so poorly choreographed and so non-directed that it looks like one of them forgot the safe word and are wearily playing for time until someone yells "cut".

7) Use environmental cues to action. If you are trying to get clinical staff to wash their hands for a certain period of time, install automatic faucets that dispense water for that period of time. If clinical staff should use a paper towel to open a door handle, provide a trashcan near the door. These types of simple environmental cues to action reinforce messaging and help people achieve change.

When I got home I felt a little knocked around but I guess the handy thing is I don’t have to go anywhere or do anything. I hung out with my lovely Quackers and soaked up the sun.

Apart from that I have a few other things happening on the cupcake front - I have finally had a logo designed and will do a separate post on that... also I have been given a recipe for eggless cupcakes, which are often requested for Hindu wedding cupcakes. Looking forward to test that out!
Frustration about the lies told about renewable energy and the deliberate distortion of renewable energy and its ability to replace fossil fuel energy generation. And frustration at the ridiculous carbon credit programme which is beyond comprehension.
I have come to hate images like the one above. In fact it gives me chills. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think the image itself looks almost pretty, star-like, and yet seeing it fills me with a range of feelings including anger, fear, sorrow, awe, and respect. You see, the “pretty white star” shouldn’t appear white on CT’s…white = blood, and this means the person had a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Gezol’s inter song banter, which consisted of the worst spoken ‘Engrish’ I have possibly ever heard, and was utterly unintelligible, didn’t dampen the proceedings a single bit. Far from it. It only managed to heighten the whole experience. Of course, as a westerner who has only become familiar with the band semi-recently, a sense of humour is absolutely vital, but I am not paying the band any lip service when I say they were fucking brilliant live! The only single gripe I have is that they didn’t play my favourite Metalucifer track, ‘Flight of the Iron Pegasus’.

That doesn’t mean they’re out of the woods yet. In fact, out of everything we’ve seen these past few years with the Mets, they seem to be just merely getting to Base Camp 1. We could see some status quo for the short-to-medium term, but long term will tell whether they’ll be completely solvent. (Don’t kid yourselves – they’re not going to be any time soon — just check out the numbers on Mike Silva’s NY Baseball Digest.)

Dallas lay in bed unable to sleep and wondering if Katrina was suffering the same fate—and for the very same reason. Did she want him as much as he wanted her? Katrina was but a few steps away, yet he dare not go to her for he was a guest, and then there was Katrina’s mother, who was just across the hall. For Dallas sleep came minutes later, but it would be short lived for soon Katrina stood over him completely nude and pondering
Men should make an effort to dress up if they're planning to take someone special to a pricey restaurant. They should wear collared shirts without the tie and matched with suit pants. They can try wearing a coat over their shirts. For accessories, they should wear a good watch. Watches are perfect accessories for men and matches with anything. For footwear, they can try brogues- this adds spice to their look.
I start to cry every time I begin a new paragraph. To be honest, I could write for days and never say enough. I never fully trusted another man after my experience with him… which I suppose is typical. My mom remarried and the guy honestly never had a chance. No matter how hard he tried, I couldn’t let him in. He carried his own baggage and problems as well, which made it even harder. I never wanted to get married or have children. I never wanted to subject my children to what I went through. Still to this day, I don’t know how my mother did it and stayed so amazingly strong.
My head was directly beneath her breasts, while she continued to stroke my jawline. As I was only half-awake, I hadn’t yet noticed that something else entirely was happening further south, and it couldn’t be Cathy’s doing. I looked down and saw Shane furiously smoking the white owl. This was an interesting turn of events, I thought to myself. When I was full mast, she ripped off her tiny shorts and hopped on.

Aside from a busy series of readings for clients, I found time to chat with my friends and fellow exhibitors. One of these was Ted Royle from FisH. He operates a new kind of energy healing routine that is transformational, energetic and dynamic. Ted combines science with higher powers to unlock our secret selves and help us to heal from the mind through the body, and outward to our immediate environment.

Garmin North America ($50) is also pretty good. It costs more, but the amount of time it takes to figure out to decide where you’re going and start the navigation is much faster than it is with Navigon. Maps are built-in to the app download so once you have the app it is ready to go. You can purchase live traffic for $15, bringing the total app cost up to $65. It’s pricey, but the user interface and experience is a step up and the rest of the app is pretty similar in quality to Navigon. It’s also a good choice if you want to shell out some money, although we have a hard time recommending the cost when the free options you have are pretty solid.
All young men studying at Ivy League universities, and at others, must bear in mind they are being continually scrutinised by some of their Professors with the intention of selecting from amongst them, those who will serve the Elite, and become part of a global network of interlocked covert and overt societies and organisations, working for the New World Order. Some of those already selected will be present among them, mingling with them and yet, in their heart, separated from them by a sense of belonging to a brotherhood with a mission that has been going on for a long time. These young men also know they will be rewarded by advancement in career and also that if they falter they could be killed!

When I read that people were using astronomical references to date the Vedas, I started learning about Indian Astronomy.. you can find my notes and articles here : http://oldthoughts.wordpress.com. Now, I understand, the method that they are using to arrive at their conclusions., what I need to know is how accurate their data and assumptions are, and also how justified they are in selecting some data and rejecting other data.
These articles also ignore a good portion of the NACE report, addressing only the degrees, not the skills employers are looking for in this highly competitive environment. You can click here for a digest of those, but they include the ability to “work in a team,” “make decisions and solve problems,” “communicate inside and outside the organization,” and “influence others.” You don’t learn this stuff in a book. Those skills, friends, are the difference between a mere “education” and a comprehensive “training” experience, or as one of my seminary professors put it, “information” vs. “formation.”
Happy Beading, Reading and Blogging!
Then I came across two single pronged alligator clips with teeth. (They look something like this, and are one of the few types of hair clips that actually stay in Blockette's hair for more than 5 min.) I couldn't remember what I bought them for so I decided to put them to use with those little white flowers.
The other point is that the vast majority of Christians are not literalists towards the New Testament - let alone towards the sometimes violent Old Testament. Every word is these two books is not meant to be 'the word of God'. The words are, in fact, mainly narratives told by various historical and fictional characters.
For example, many teaching gurus stress the importance of placing trades in a simulator or demo account. Doing this, they say, will prove out their “secret” method – which of course they will share with you for a high fee – and then you’ll be set to start raking in cash.

Early in his career Springsteen seemed obsessed with cars, the road, and the need to escape. ‘Born to Run’, released in 1975, speaks of wholesale disenchantment – “In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream. At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines.” Turnpikes, highways, and freeways all feature strongly in Bruce’s USA. The automotive imagery is potent – “Just wrap your legs ‘round these velvet rims, and strap your arms across my engines”. The song pleads with the audience to get out while they’re young. Destination unknown, it is the freedom of leaving that matters.
I can't believe this semester is almost over and Ammon is almost done with his 2nd year of school. Where has the time gone. We are starting a garden this year and are really enjoying working outside again. I love gardening. It is so fulfilling to me and such a stress relief for Ammon. The kids love playing in the dirt and we love to eat the fruits of our labor so it is a total win-win situation.
and then, almost as quickly as it came in and destroyed your not-remotely-terrible-despite-being-jobless-sort-of-homeless-and-totally-single life, it begins to lift. or maybe more accurately, it begins to shift. the initial feeling of “i may actually be capable of smiling again” catches you off guard. you hear yourself laughing and it feels foreign. but you’re worried. you hesitate. you’re not sure it will last so you don’t want to jump to any rash decisions…

Buying a house together has definitely been a learning experience. One thing I learned about the boyfriend is that he needs to write things down and make lists in order to get things done. For example, he has to sit down with a spread sheet and go over every expense/savings in order to determine how much he has left over at the end of the month. I handle these things a little bit differently. I like to pay for what needs to be paid for and whatever is left over I either put some into savings or spend. Simple. Easy. And no complicated spread sheets required. Part of my mentality comes from the fact that I have lived on my own before and have had bills to pay since I was old enough to open my own bank account.

Okay, that’s it. The universe was probably telling me something. I moved my chair way back from the field so that I could continue reading in relative safety. The game concluded, several people came over to me to see if I was okay, yeah, yeah, fine, I answered as I waved them off and turned the book’s pages.

In January our arts and crafts instructor, Gitana the Creative Diva, was awarded a grant by the Department of Cultural Affairs to continue the senior crafting program at DSCC. In order to fulfill the grant requirement of community outreach and participation, we partnered with a fourth grade class at PS 119K, The Amersfort School, to create a display for the school's annual global expo. The focus of study was Kenya, an African country which has, among its many attributes, a thriving floral export industry. Since Dorchester's seniors had already spent some time creating flowers, that was one of the elements we focused on for our crafting experience. The students came to the center and were divided into three groups. One group cut large monstera leaves, others joined the seniors to create chrysanthemums and the third group worked with center director JoAnne Biswakarma to create headbands and bracelets in needlepoint that imitated the ornate beadwork that the Maasai people of Kenya are known for. 25 fourth graders, 8 seniors, and two group facilitators equaled a very hectic atmosphere but to their credit the young students were very well behaved and took instructions well. In an hour and a half we created some beautiful flowers, leaves and needlework.

Authorities said a buddy or two distracted the store's clerk while the thief tried to open the till behind the counter. But it's locked, and the bandit was forced to look elsewhere for his loot. Moments later, security cameras captured the bandit as he moved over to the store's ATM. The man is seen trying to lift the machine off the ground, but clearly he finds that it's too heavy to move. "He tries to rock it loose... tries a couple grapple holds on the machine," said Gary Keller of the South Salt Lake Police Department. "I don't know what he was planning on doing if he did get ahold of this machine. He doesn't look like a bodybuilder by any means." At that point, police say the man leaves the store -- but not for long.

In it, Weizman—an Israeli architect and prominent critic of that nation's territorial policy—documents many of the emerging spatial techniques used by the Israeli Defense Forces in their high-tech, legally dubious 2002 invasion of Nablus. During that battle, Weizman writes, "soldiers moved within the city across hundred-meter-long 'overground-tunnels' carved through a dense and contiguous urban fabric." Their movements were thus almost entirely camouflaged, with troop movements hidden from above by virtue of always remaining inside buildings. "Although several thousand soldiers and several hundred Palestinian guerrilla fighters were maneuvering simultaneously in the city," Weizman adds, "they were so 'saturated' within its fabric that very few would have been visible from an aerial perspective at any given moment."

Most shooters have an affinity for their first gun. It may be the first gun they had ever shot or the first gun they owned, but most people I've met speak fondly of that first gun, no matter what it is or was. A friend of mine has has been diligently searching gun shows, dealers, and online sources for his first gun, or at least one just like it, for several years. Fortunately, my first gun is still with me and has its own special place in the gun safe among it's many siblings.

While the mantle of beer production in Leeds now passes to Leeds Brewery, Tetley's the brand still exists. How you feel about the relocation of production isn't about how the beer tastes, or how an international business has treated its assets. It's about a personal story, about how you relate to current affairs and weave them into your personal history.

The doctor came in and explained that since my water broke, they wanted to get a “baseline reading” so they could tell if I was progressing. I explained that cervical dilation was not a very accurate way of marking progression, so I would prefer not to, since I was handling the labor so well. The rest of the conversation
For me, there’s always been a strong connection between these two dates. I’m surely not alone among those Americans who’ve heard of him to count Lincoln as my favorite president. He overcame humble beginnings, marriage to a woman described in contemporary accounts as “bonkers,” and the death of four of his five children, and biographers count these among the good times. He presided over dissolution of the Union and a subsequent Civil War that killed over half a million of his countrymen. When victory was finally achieved and he got the rare opportunity to go out on the town — wouldn’t you know it — he was assassinated.

Today I've got a really fun tutorial to share with you. I love making my own flowers and few years ago, saw these in a book on the art of Origami paper folding I picked up at a Thrift store. I didn't make them at the time, but they stayed with me, and when I saw Connie McCotter's card, in Card Maker magazine March- Flower Power! issue, I was inspired again to give these a try!
People should seriously consider why they’re so compelled to portray everything down to and including 30 minute visual junk food as a battleground for a culture war. An optimist could presume it’s an encouraging sign that our biggest concerns have returned again to trivial bullshit, but the cynic in me says it’s just a convenient distraction from more complicated matters that most people are too stupid or lazy to contemplate.

The plastic needed pulling. I don't like the idea of using so much plastic but there is no way we could do without it!

People want to be known as honest, hard-working, trustworthy, and competent; I doubt anyone starts a career intending to lie or cheat their way to the top. However, as leaders we are determined to succeed, and if we’re not careful, our ambition can overshadow our vision of the moral person we aspire to be. We can lose track of who we are as we strive toward what we desire to accomplish. Personal accountability means being answerable to our “better selves” or to the sort of honorable human being we would like to be. Developing personal accountability involves three steps:
Some would say madness, some would say luck, others probably wouldn’t be interested. The answer is a burning desire to contribute to rural Australia and desire to make a difference to people’s lives.

Paige Donahue has always lived in her sister Camille's shadow. As children, Camille had the grades, the friends, and their parents' love, while Paige was left with hand-me-downs and criticism. Now as adults, Camille lives an idyllic life with her husband, Pierce, and her two perfect children in a beautiful home, while Paige is stuck in a small condo with bills she can't afford to pay. But no more. With seeds of doubt planted in both Camille's and Pierce's minds, Paige's plan to steal her brother-in law starts to work. But when he reveals his decision to make his marriage work, a desperate Paige moves from envy to madness. What results from her dangerous scheme is something no one could have imagined.

O’Reilly started out publishing print books. Today they publish eBooks – which in turn enhance demand for print book. They hold webinars, events like Tools of Change and many other specialist tech meetings. I was talking with Sharon Cordesse from O’Reilly over dinner last night and discovered that only a little over 50% of O’Reilly’s revenues now arise from e- and p-books. The remainder comes from the complex web business activities built up around their specialist brand.

Structural variables, such as the “third wave of democratization” and the end of the Cold War, aided and augmented the justice cascade. Yet, these structural factors cannot solely or fully account for the normative shift to the promotion of individual criminal accountability. For Sikkink, the purveyors of these norms, what she calls “norm entrepreneurs,” “started with some ideas about the need for individual criminal accountability and, by campaigning and agitating, helped make this norm global in scope.” Individuals like Luis Moreno Ocampo, the first and only ICC prosecutor and a prominent lawyer in the Argentine Trial of the Juntas, and Cherif Bassiouni, a law professor at DePaul University and one of the earliest and most strident advocates of inserting the individual into human rights prosecutions, militated towards diffusing a new norm regarding human rights abuses. Indeed, Sikkink notes that “the first change that needed to occur for the justice norm to advance was that international law had to begin to focus on the individual.” This normative shift could have arguably not come about through a top-down process, whereby powerful states, such as the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, willingly sacrifice a key component of their sovereignty. This is surely why the United States has never ratified the Rome Statute. Rather, the justice cascade “started in domestic politics in the semi-periphery and diffused outwards and upwards through horizontal diffusion from one country to another, and then via bottom-up vertical diffusion from individual countries to international organizations and international NGOs.” Moreover, the sustained efforts of individuals like Moreno-Ocampo and Bassiouni furthered aided the active diffusion of ideas related to the justice norm.
I wondered if I could handle the pressure. I wondered whether or not I would crack. Billy Joel walked by with Christie Brinkley. He looked like an Italian leprechaun next to her cool blond goddess. He was singing the national anthem. Finally half-time arrived. The show started, and I took to the seas with the grace of a swan. Every element of the show went off smoothly, perfectly. I was in perfect sync with the world around me. I was high on my ability. I never wanted it to end. Yes, it was strange to be in charge of a show that spanned an entire football field, and stranger even that the people in the stands weren't watching. This was strictly for the folks at home, watching it on TV.
To the extent that online journalism is carried out by constitutional corporations, it will be open to federal regulation via the corporations power in the same way the print journalism is. However, the extent of federal power is less certain where the online content is published by an entity that is not a constitutional corporation. A large number of individuals and bodies fall into this category, including any news outlets that operate as sole traders or partnerships, individual bloggers, and individuals posting on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter.

Education establishes the needed knowledge for the field so students can enter a career. Beginning education is available once students search out the right degree for them.
When Jimmy hung up the phone, he wondered what she meant that he never watched out for her. He knew Johnny and her were always closer but wasn't he the one that always reigned Mitch in when he would start teasing her. She must have forgotten about that. Too bad he was leaving in the morning; he would have liked to have had dinner with her and Johnny. It had been a long time since the three sat together and talked. He quickly got back to work so he could leave early.

Scripture tells us that the Egyptian taskmasters afflicted the children of Israel with their burdens and made them miserable with hard labor—making bricks and mortar and backbreaking work in the fields. They piled on the work, crushing them under the cruel workload. The children of Israel served Egypt under very hard bondage. However, Yahweh heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob and put His plan into motion to redeem the children of Israel.

We have concluded that the school is correct that even with learning support, he may not be able to handle the IB program in 11th and 12th grade, when the schedule becomes much more self-directed and college-like. Because it is, after all, a preparatory school, and a certain level of maturity is reasonably expected (I went to a prep school myself, so I ought to know.)
Perhaps the biggest difference that seperates the brain of a human and the processor of a computerized automaton or robot is conscience. We humans compute everything on pain, pleasure, and emotion. We try to be civil and we try to be logical but we all know that there is more to humanity than logic. There's a spiritual side to being human.

Gertrude Stein, who was an atheist but an ethnic Jew lived in Paris during the war with her 'companion' Alice B. Toklas. As a non-French citizen of Jewish background, she normally would have been among the first deported to places like Auschwitz and Treblinka, as the majority of Jews in France were. However, she and Toklas not only survived the war but were not molested in any way...because Stein not only had useful friends like Fay, but because she had been an outspoken and unabashed admirer of Hitler since the 1930s, even proposing him for a Nobel Peace Prize in spite of what she saw going on right in front of her eyes.

I've been having a dilemma over our kitchen backsplash for over 2 months now and I'm here to admit that I still haven't decided on anything for sure. Incase you forgot, this is what my kitchen currently looks like .... It's very white, clean and airy ... which is not necessarily bad, but I do want to add a little more interest and pattern to the mix. Recently we added some grey stripes to our breakfast nook and will eventually be adding either brown or black bench seating around the window. We sort of decided on our hood and will probably going with this viking range hood.

Extreme leftist dogma and rigidity has done more to destroy the dream of multiculturalism than anything… outside of Islam.

The memo is irrelevant, according to an assistant to Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is defending the State Police in the case. “All cigarettes within New York State are presumed to be subject to tax until the contrary is established,” said Aaron M. Baldwin, in a brief. He said that only a licensed cigarette agent can possess untaxed cigarettes in New York and that agent must show proof of a legal sale exempt from taxes. The brief suggests that HCI could resell the Signals to customers in New York, thereby denying New York required taxes. The driver of the seized Signals shipment told State Police that he often delivers cigarettes from the Winnebago reservation in Nebraska to the Poospatuck reservation on Long Island, according to court documents.

I have thought about getting a guitar for years but I have never done it for one reason or another. Last December my sister Marilyn spontaneously bought a cello because she has always wanted to play one. I was very surprised when she did this and I asked her what made her do it.

I owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Lisa Sandell, my editor at Scholastic, with whom I have worked on two other nonfiction projects. For each book, we become a bit more organized about the way we gather, vet, and determine primary photographs to use. I put together a binder of potential photos, and then she and the photo researchers at Scholastic added to that. Since we weren’t able to meet in person, we actually did a Skype meeting to review the final selections together.

I didn't buy anything new for this wall {except for the prints}. Most of the frames I actually made back in the day! Once I laid everything out I picked my colors I wanted them to be. I wanted just a hint of blue to carry your eye along the wall, I spray painted the black frames and lucky for me the cream frames were already painted when I first made them!! I also really really wanted subway art on the wall to kind of mix things up, I made them as well {Tutorial here}! The mirror I also made and put the hooks on to give it a little more character. I love that this wall is the first thing you see when you walk in the door! It makes me smile!
The second time I awoke that night, I knew something wasn't right. I'd woken up briefly maybe fifteen minutes before, around 5AM, and had woozily considered going for a piss, but instead had simply nodded off again. This time, however, I knew I would have to make the trip round the corner to the bathroom. I can't recall now if Rachel, lying beside me, asleep, stirred or not as I pushed back the duvet and swivelled out of the bed, a nagging sense of unease at the back of my mind. Most nights one or the other of us has to get up and go to the loo, but it's rare the other person will remain completely undisturbed, so I think she at least came partly awake.

There were not and still are not any homes of the kind and size we have for the amount we are paying. I’m not sure this is necessarily a forever home for us, but I can think of much worse places to land for a few years while we get back on our feet financially. Plus, it is low maintenance and I love this place. Things could be much, much worse.
well, thank you for your patience and diligence if you read this whole tutorial. hopefully i got it posted in time for you to be able to read the whole thing AND still have time to watch the celebrity apprentice tonight. *wink*

Third, I take issue with the parents claim here that they love their child, and only took action here for financial reasons. You can't say you would have killed her on one hand, then profess love for her on the other. It's morally repugnant and an insult to her as a basic human being. Fortunately for their daughter, she will probably never be fully able to comprehend the fact that her parents wish they could have aborted her.
Got another positive piece of news when I learned that Komen "Race For The Cure" group has cut off funding to Planned Parenthood. It's long overdue; how can you continue to associate with a group so controversial when you should be focusing attention on something as non-controversial as curing cancer?
I know one thing, I was a different man when I left the prayer room that day than I was when I went in, feeling strangely healed in many ways. Whether he was an angel or not, I have no doubt God placed Mark in my path that day. God Bless-JFT

"I have given my life to alleviate the sufferings of Africa. There is something that all White men who have lived here like I have must learn and know: that these individuals are a sub-race. They have neither the mental or emotional abilities to equate or share equally with White men in any functions of our civilization. I have given my life to try to bring unto them the advantages which our civilization must offer, but I have become well aware that we must retain this status: White the superior, and they the inferior. For whenever a White man seeks to live among them as their equals, they will destroy and devour him, and they will destroy all his work. And so for any existing relationship or any benefit to this people, let White men, from anywhere in the world, who would come to help Africa, remember that you must maintain this status: you the master and they the inferior, like children whom you would help or teach. Never fraternize with them as equals. Never accept them as your social equals or they will devour you. They will destroy you." - Dr. Albert Schweitzer

Are you going to fast tomorrow? Think about it, it is Eid Al-Ghadeer when it is highly recommended to fast, and Thanksgiving! So why not time your dinner for iftar? If you don't celebrate Thanksgiving, then fast anyway! If you have days to make up, this is a perfect day to fast. It is Thursday, Ghadeer, and a short day.
It’s been quite a while since my last post. Here is a quick rundown of why-
Celebrate by offering thanks for our abundant earth. Light candles of orange and yellow, burn incense of rose or sandalwood. Prepare a meal of lamb, wheat bread, apples and wine and offer it to Lugh or whichever deity you owe some thanks to. Don't forget to include some fun in the day including some games or competitions. photo found here
The first is not for the sensitive or faint of heart. It is called "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo." It's the sort of movie I usually wouldn't like because it is pretty gory and nasty in spots. But it's also an extremely good thriller. I could see what the solution to the mystery was going to be, but I don't have any way of knowing if it's obvious to everyone.

There have always been a very small number of desperate determined people who, whether they receive palliative care or not, wish to end their lives. Most of them are not even disabled or terminally ill. What Falconer does not tell us is that hard cases make bad law and that part of living in a democratic society involves accepting that there are certain ‘freedoms’ we cannot exercise because of the detrimental adverse effects a change in the law might have on others. The law, with its blanket prohibition on assisted suicide, is as it is to protect vulnerable people from exploitation and abuse by those who might have an interest, financial or otherwise, in their deaths.

Erica arrived in Hawaii and the game was afoot! That night, with the plan in place, the waiter had the special coconut, and the sunset was beautiful! The problem was Erica didn’t feel like having a coconut drink! What to do? Finally, Nic gave in and ordered one of the drinks himself and turned the coconut around so Erica would notice the message. It was all he hoped it would be…tears, laughter, surprise, and joy with a topping of dancing on the beach in the moonlight!

I let out a groan from deep in my chest as my body stiffened and my insides exploded in an orgasm that I heard first inside of my head. It started as a rumble like thunder that gathered every bit of sensation my body could create and concentrated it in my cock and perineum. I felt it gather from my fingertips and my toes and my anus and my balls and well up just behind my cock. Then in one enormous squeezing pulse it shot a stream of white hot cum in the air. As the rope of cum was hurled from me the exquisite sensation of her finger in my anus forced another spasm to eject another rope of cum that followed the trajectory of the first one.

I'm also charge nurse, dealing with staffing and bed assignments and crises. I'm also acting as secretary, breaking down charts and answering the phones and entering orders.

I'm also the only person who's allowed to do certain tests (with hyperagitated goo and saline), so I do all of the ones in the entire hospital, as well as the clinic next door. Plus, I do around a hundred chart audits a month to make sure we're in compliance with whatever brilliant idea the Joint Commission's come up with this week.

I have long avoided On the Road--for a variety of reasons. For one, there is Truman Capote's famous gloss, "That's not writing, that's typing." Second, there has been entirely too much said and written about the work so that it is nearly impossible to read without all of the baggage. And third, the several times I tried it, I simply wasn't hooked, I found it overwritten and simplistic.

Moses had told them that they must put away all leaven from their tables and from their houses for seven days and they must offer the blood of the sacrifice without leaven. They were not to break any bones of the Passover Lamb and they were only to sacrifice the Passover only at the place appointed by Yahweh. And that all the males of the congregation must appear before the LORD at Passover time.
As I’m learning to face my new truth — that I’m going to have to find a new way of life, a new focus and new meaning — I’m recalling how relieved I was that he died. I feel selfish and self-indulgent for wanting him back, for yearning for him, for begging one more word or smile from him. Even the thought that he might have stayed a while longer if he could to satisfy my selfish longings makes me weep for him and for me. He was terrified of lingering as a helpless invalid, and if he hadn’t died, if he had remained here with me, he would have been helpless. I’m glad he didn’t have to deal with that, glad he’s safe from further indignities, glad he’s spared pain and a reliance on drugs. (He was taking so many drugs that he feared becoming a drug addict but, knowing how little time he had left, I could tearfully promise him he would never become a drug addict.)
This radical leftist slashed the throat of a college dean out of the mistaken belief that he was the governor of Tennessee. It happened last September. And nobody reported it simply because, well, they couldn’t figure out a way to turn this radical leftist into a Republican.
I like to try and photograph ‘scary’ things in a way that people can appreciate and hopefully find beauty in.

Let us take Tunisia as an example. The former Tunisian dictator Zeinulabedeen bin Ali, who has been given asylum in the land of Prophet Muhammed (S), sought rather frantically to discourage people from observing Islam. He imprisoned and tortured thousands of Muslim activists for just frequenting the mosques. He instructed his repressive police apparatus to hound every religious person and fight every form of religiosity.

So what are the reasons for shunning Gods calling? I give you four. First is to doubt His word; unfaithfulness. Secondly; an unwillingness to leave the comforts and pleasures of this life. Set your affection on things above, not the things of this earth. Thirdly; there is the fear of the unknown. God has already been there. Finally; there is sensing one’s inability. God will never give you a task to do without also giving to you the ability to do it. This is proven time and again in Biblical history.
After waking up in the forest, it’s particularly magical in the mornings, we begin with yoga class – a relatively Yang (more vigorous) Asana practice of 1 and a half hours of practice and half an hour of meditation.

When I started out as a writer, I had huge ambitions to write a novel, to get published, and to BE a writer (whatever I thought that meant). Over past years, I have had some publications, I've not written a novel, but I've written stories and prose poems and letters and poetry. I used to feel I might die if I wasn't a writer, I felt as if I was meant to be a writer and if I couldn't be then it was a catastrophy. But, now I'm more realistic. I've no agent, no novel, not much promise of publishing a book, and to be honest I'm on the peripheries of every part of the writing world.

Poem for the Red Bridge Autumn Ceremony
Did you know that Gram and Imma are Besties?
I wish I could say that the Zan-Gah stories are completely accurate, but my approach was not primarily archaeological; it was humanistic. Zan-Gah is about courage, brotherhood, and compassion, among other things. Were prehistoric people compassionate? I doubt it. Nevertheless, I tried to be accurate where it counted. I researched slings and hand fishing. I researched prehistoric twins, discovering that in some early societies twins were terribly frightening and killed immediately—and so was the mother (not the father). That information was important in the development of my plot. I had never actually been inside a cave, so I visited Onondaga, one of the world's great caves (my state of Missouri is famous for them), and was overwhelmed by the experience. I took notes furiously. I was the only guy in the whole cave who was taking notes. Some of them appear almost verbatim in the first book.

America, a humane society, ought to take pity on the persecuted descendants of another Protestant patriarchy. However, even if American immigration policy welcomed white South Africans, which it doesn’t, Afrikaners would find it hard to leave. The Boers (and British) built the place. Like Heidi away from the Alps, Afrikaners tend to wilt when separated from their homeland. Not for nothing have the Afrikaners been dubbed “The White Tribe of Africa.” They are as African as black South Africans. What is to be done, then, in light of the fact that Afrikaner farmers, in particular, are being killed off at alarmingly high rates? While it remains for the secessionists to “give territorial content” to their aspirations, secession is one of the escape routes suggested in the conclusion, “Saving South Africans S.O.S.”

The Papists were the Roman Catholics who wanted the English church to be returned under the authority of the Pope.

This is remembered annually in the Guy Fawkes fire works.
National Media Museum – The most popular museum outside London and with a cornucopia of great reasons. The number of Bradfordians I’ve spoken to who have been to NMM – on a school trip decades ago and never since – is unbelievable. They haven’t stood still, you know! NMM is exciting, fascinating and enthralling in equal measure, and it needs our support lest we lose it to another city. And it’s not just the museum: the films they show range from current blockbusters (in very plush surroundings) to the greatest cinematic treats since Chaplain was a little boy. I’m not a great lover of going t’flicks, but seeing Batman and Harry Potter 3D in the IMAX just about changed my mind. The cost of a seat’s less than a multiplex and is ploughed straight back into improving, developing and enriching the museum.
Another one!!! Another standing O. Well deserved. That’s 4 so far… all boys. This performance was by far the most emotionally taxing one that Joshua has done. At the very end there was a catch in his voice as he almost broke down in tears, and man, that was powerful. It really pulled us all in; it was so emotionally believable…… great job… great performance.
So, just like any typical girl, I've heard about Guerlain's meteorites but I've never tried it before so, I thought, this product would work similarly like Guerlain's meteorites. I tested it out on the back of my hand. At the time I was trying out this product at Etude House, I did not manage to snap any pictures but I did so when I got back home. Here are several pictures of the product out of the pump.
"Okay then." She was about to tell me when her face clouded over again. "You really should be getting this information from his doctor, though."
Basically, pre-capitalist nostalgia. So even with lots of scheming, it still clear that swords make blood, even as there’s lots of play to understand what a social role means, since the contexts and stakes were much clearer than today, but perhaps its the dissolution of them in all the scheming which makes them resonate so nicely with today. Such narratives also often have ways of getting around issues of race, at least as they manifest in America, and hence provide some wish fulfillment. On all fronts, it’s clear to me that the popularity of ‘men with swords/women in court’ dramas is that it provides a counterpoint to the much more ambiguous needs of our age, even as it reflects this nevertheless.
It was absolutely amazing! Amazing! Amazing!

Some of you didn’t become aware of my plans until several days before for my departure while others had been aware of them from the moment I began toying with the idea and it’s been the latter group that brought me to the realization over the past few days that something is missing. I’ve been on the road for almost two weeks now, and it’s been a blast! I’m getting a kick out of visiting new places, sightseeing, taking pictures and sharing them with family and friends. But by day’s end, I’m tired and all I want to do is “shut it down” for the day.

I decided to take the weekend to pamper the wound. No lifting. No stretching. No bending. Or as little as possible. A little hard since I had to go grocery shopping but DH was my helper and went in with me, pushed the heavy cart, got items off the lower and top of shelves, then he and the boys brought the groceries in for me. Of course I had to put them away after we got home but every little bit helps while I am on the mend.
I live 2,000 miles from Mom, and I called her later that night to see how her birthday had gone. I think we were on the phone for about 2 hours, and all she could talk about was the Kitty Tube. She said she kept going outside to admire it like it was a new car, and she proclaimed more than once that it was the “Cadillac of cat houses”! So there you have it – Mom & Ms. Kitty have spoken!

now, I consider anything fun, as long as my son is having fun. The other day I spent a majority of the day following him around outside as he explored a huge field, played in the dirt etc. Walking around a field is NOT my idea of a "fun" day, but at the end of the day I realized that I had had a really enjoyable, and relaxing day just walking around hanging out with my son and watching him learn, play and enjoy himself immensely outside.
And the results? Some genomic regions did deviate from the level of 21.61% European admixture. Many of them were associated with diseases, like prostate cancer and hypertension, that are more common among African Americans than among Euro Americans. Alleles that protect against malaria were also less frequent than would be predicted by European admixture. This is evidence that natural selection has been eliminating alleles that are less necessary in North America.

Although happy to read stories and snuggle in his bed, he doesn’t actually want to sleep in it by himself. I have rarely been successful leaving the room before he is asleep. If he does fall asleep he does it with at least one hand holding on to my arm, which makes it very hard to get out of bed without him waking up. We tend to do better on the weekends when he is more tired because he doesn’t get a nap.
Such a niche "The Bride of Christ" does not hope to compete with. First of all, this editor has the disadvantage of not being able to speak German. On the other hand, this gives "The Bride of Christ" an opportunity to address and uphold the catholicity of the historic liturgy in its relationship with the One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. "The Bride of Christ" is a Lutheran journal yet it has never shied from accepting the historic liturgy and in its catholicity and orthodoxy.

And while Wilde says he loved Bosie, and it is very possible he did in some way, it was a non-love, what Plato would call a vulgar love, what Wilde describes as “coarse uncompleted passions”; “appetite without distinction”; “desire without limit” (52). His life, and his self are better without him; without Bosie, he experiences realizations, makes art, and with Bosie he is crowded with emotion, he is suffering, and believes it is Bosie’s neglect, and while it is, it is mostly Wilde that stands in the way of himself; “nobody, great or small, can be ruined except by his own hand” (55).
However it wasn't his hand or the word he said that made me bite my tongue. It wasn't even the steely clang of the word when he spoke. It was the look on his face.

At the same time this system combined with consensus and even modified consensus has effectively kept the OWS movement from charting a course toward working class action independent from the ruling class politics. Rather this system allows and promotes the ruling class ideology through the multiple transmission belts of the liberals, progressives, labor leaders, pacifists, fake socialists and anarchists. These political tendencies swim well in the OWS because their role is to prevent the working class from developing a program that guides the working class to the seizure of economic and political power.

In working my way along the animal, after the tail, the toes seemed like the next appropriate spot to move to. There’s recently been some good trotter chat on twitter, so if you want to keep abreast of that, you’d better give me a follow! Acting on the advice of Luke from the restaurant Dough, then disregarding it somewhat (sorry), I slow cooked my trotters in water with four cloves for six hours on high. This makes the most amazing stock. However, I made a beginnners mistake and realised after I’d removed the elbows that what I had were not chunky back trotters, but slimline fore trotters – that equals less meat.

Oh…how true that is! It’s not that I don’t like people because I do. I like people a lot. It’s just that my most favorite person is my husband and if I have to spend time with anyone I want to spend time with him. Today I have to work until 5pm and then I have to drive an hour away to attend the graduation of my cousin who, let’s be honest, probably doesn’t really care if I’m there or not. I remember at my graduation I was so focused on my friends and my parents that I didn’t know who was there and to this day I don’t remember who all came. It didn’t matter because I was too hung up on the parties going on that weekend. I’m sure my cousin is feeling the same way.

It was at the latter institution in 1908 that Harpo Marx joined the Marx Brothers. Well, obviously he joined them when he was born, but this is when he joined the act. At the time, the act was a singing act called the Three Nightingales, and consisted of Groucho, Gummo, (the brother who never made it onto film) and a kid named Lou Levy. Harpo and Chico each had separate careers playing piano in saloons, whorehouses and silent movies. Apparently, on one occasion, the boys’ mother Minnie, who did the booking, booked them as a quartet at Henderson’s Coney Island. The theater wanted a quartet so she said the group was a quartet to get the booking. In his autobiography, Harpo Speaks, Harpo writes of being grabbed by his mother right in the middle of playing in the movie theater and dragged out to the gig. Harpo couldn’t sing. He was petrified, and by his own account, he wet his pants.
It prolonged the Eritrean-Ethiopian war by nearly a decade. It is inspiring Bill Gates‘ programme to rid the continent of malaria, when, in the almost complete absence of personal self-discipline, that disease is one of the most efficacious forms of population-control now operating.
Ephesians 2:14-18
Whenever I try a new recipe, the whole family dreads it. I have not had too many successes. I get this cooking magazine that had a week worth of recipes with a convenient little shopping list included. I did it but by day five I was done spending that much time in the kitchen every night. The recipes were not that great either, or actually my ability to make them might have been the real problem. So, I returned to my rotation of spaghetti, tacos, pork in a pan, sloppy joes, some kind of chicken/vegetable stir fry, and maybe if I want to get real exciting, I might throw a tuna fish dinner in there. Oh, how sad is that?
Since the Wayne family were billionaires, what the hell were they doing in a dark, dirty alley? Could they not find the main theater exit like everyone else? Even if they did decide to avoid the crowd and slip out the back, where the f*ck was Alfred?! Where was the communication?! This is why communication is important, people!!
Instead of the bordering-on-jello lemon filling thickened with liberal amounts of corn starch, I did a smooth and juicy lemon curd. This really is how all lemon meringues should be. The little bear ate a huge slice and asked for seconds. It went so fast, in fact, I didn’t get any pictures of the lovely lemon curd center.
For the sauce, combine the chili sauce, ketchup, horseradish, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, and Tabasco. Serve as a dip with the shrimp.

He thought it might be a cool place to sit....until she moved on him. I wish I had gotten a few more pictures, but once the treadle moved, he was out of there. I guess he's not destined to be a spinner.
Blackened wood from a past fire does not always mean that the wood members are significantly damaged. Therefore, further evaluation of the fire damage is recommended. You should also contact the local authorities to see if a fire report on the property was ever filed.
Jung Chang is a clever woman and an excellent writer, but she can be stern and serious, and I suspect she would be rather grim company (well to be fair she did have a rotten childhood growing up in the Chinese Cultural Revolution). But being next to the anarchic and foul-mouthed Peter Cooke might do her good and lighten her up a bit.

Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as you do to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the church, his body, of which he is the Savior. Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. ~Paul

Just give him a mic and lend him your ears and he’ll take you on a ride that veers from troubadour storytelling to rave-ups and hoedowns, sometimes within the same song. Fixin’ to Die is worth repeated spins, whether on a road trip or kickin’ back at home with some beverages. Hot or cold.
And, as I predicted at the time, the Liberal politicians from Benghazi, had, and have no social base within the country. Their support comes from outside, from the Imperialists. As a result, real control is in the hands, as it had to be, of the Islamist militias, and increasingly it seems elements of Al Qaeda with whom the Libyan Jihadists have long had connections, including during the time they were fighting in Iraq. The only way the bourgeois Liberal politicians will be able to govern will be with the assistance of outside intervention by Imperialism.

The first part of dreamlining is to come up with some dreams for your life. You can do this by praying, thinking about things you've always wanted to do, or talking with your partner. However, I found this task realy difficult. Tim calls this a vacuum which is created through work. I believe it can be created through a number of things such as the day to day happenings of life, and barriers such as time and money. I mean how many of us bother dreaming about things that are too expensive for our budgets, let alone have the time to sit and think anyway? So, I had a vacuum.

I understand he drives a hackney-coach, though how he does it, unless he stands on the footboard behind, and lies along the roof upon his chest, with his chin in the box, it would be difficult to comprehend. He brought his gun with him, as a curiosity. Christened 'The Little Rifle,' and displayed outside a shop-window, it would make the fortune of any retail business in Holborn. When he had shown himself and talked a little while, he withdrew with his pocket-instrument, and went bobbing down the cabin, among men of six feet high and upwards, like a light-house walking among lamp-posts.

Now the taste...oh my that's where the fun begins. I tasted a pleasant caramel flavor along with toffee and chocolate. This combination of delicious flavors made for a very enjoyable experience. There was also an alcohol flavor present while drinking, but mostly in the background and I could definitely tell I was drinking something very strong. World Wide Stout was also very smooth going down.

I should be finished with the newest Lego Star Wars game in a couple of days, I hope. The biggest problem I had was one of my own making. To finish certain quests a particular character needs to be used and normally I would spend time wandering around trying to find this character but this morning I figured out that if I went to one of the control centers I could switch to what ever character I needed. The game is still a lot of fun and I will be sad when I am finished.
What does that mean? It means we are going to see office and commercial space that aligns itself with this work from anywhere, at anytime, 24/7 workforce and we will see changes in spaces that start to reflect this change in mobility and adaptability more and more.
Before dinner, you can wander the grounds. There were some Hawaiians making various crafts, as well as photographers taking photos that you can purchase as a souvenir, although we received a coupon for a complimentary photograph. When the time came, many gathered around the "Imu" (underground oven) to watch the unearthing of the kalua pig. With it, one of the men explained the preparation of the pig and the luau.

An Education is a film of revealing. Danish director Lone Scherfig takes her time in telling the story, leading the audience through passages of beautiful cinematography and fine acting, suspenseful scenes and memorable interludes. David does not at all appear to be the nasty predator. And Jenny, on her part, also attempts to test the limit. She’s not vain, but honestly dazzled and bewildered. The consent of her naive parents passes the ball back to her court, she must learn to make choices herself.

The sick proponents of human depopulation and global genocide are surprisingly very vocal and upfront about their views and goals. Robert J. Smith, adjunct environmental scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, explained their perverse mindset and radical worldview in a speech he gave in 2005 at the Ninth Annual National Conference on Private Property Rights called, “The Pleistocene Park Project—Removing Civilization from North America.” He said:
We're presenting our initial recommendations early next week. We're suggesting improvements in enforcement, community outreach, prevention, education, treatment, and youth opportunity. The recommendations came together pretty quickly, because most of us have already spent a good deal of time dealing with drug and crime issues in one way or another.

Cell phones and computers have helped expose some of the recent uprising in Egypt and Syria, spread rumors about Charlie Sheen, and the latest baseball scores. The subject that produced a record setting 5,106 tweets per second (TechNewsCast 2011) was the rumor from Keith Urbahn, White House staff, when he tweeted “So I’m told by a reputable person they have killed Osama Bin Laden. Hot damn.” In less than 30 minutes, hundreds of thousands of tweeters spread the message around the virtual global network. Crowds began to gather in solidarity to celebrate a victory before any formal announcement. A new connection was being made; a shared emotion of victory brought an opportunity for a new collective consciousness. The sociologists suggest we need “an open society based on trust in which people are free to exercise their capacities for improvisation, altruism, and solidarity.” (Solnit 2009) The death of bin Laden brought crowds together in the streets, cheering with jubilation, but how many will stay informed when the media moves onto a new story? The social media sent the excitement around the world and began entwining small strands of hope together. Who will continue weaving the conversation? Can social media create a community strong enough to change the collective consciousness?

Once I made this decision another turn of events came into play. Due to unexpected circumstances I also became the culinary artist for my in-laws for the first week of Lent. Both my wife and mother-in-law are fabulous cooks, so........uh-oh. However, I soldiered on. The spirit of Lent 2011 for me is maintaining a helpful attitude and to look for opportunities to provide help to others. You get what you pray for.

Most recipes that call for bitters call for a 'dash.' Gaz Regan taught me to disregard that. Watching him make a Manhattan once, I counted 14 dashes. The folks who have looked into this sort of thing say bitters are essential, both in the drinks that traditionally call for them, and in many that don't. I find the bitterness is what gives the drink its sophistication.

Privacy invasion via these sites is another serious issue. We cannot control the activity of each of our friends and relatives. And it’s impossible for us to ascertain ho is doing what and thinking what. This lack of control sometimes make us encounter undesirable comments and activities which finally disturb our mood.Being linked to a number of online sites increases the chance of receiving useless spams. Though our personal information is not leaked, the records that these engines have might be misused by cyber hackers. Stalking to others profile and annoying them is not a desirable thing. Some misuse these sites for displaying their phony nature and criminal activities. But since we cannot completely switch off from them, its up to us how safe we can be being there.

All goes well until they notice a ship flying above them. The ship signals the beginning of the “Reaping”, where the Tributes are chosen. Katniss and Gale have their names listed several times, as they receive enough grain and oil to make it through a year by doing so. Katniss’ sister, Primrose (Willow Shields), is also up for her first Reaping, but the odds are slim that she will be chosen. The time for the Reaping begins with a flourish, thanks to Effie Trinkett (Elizabeth Banks), and the first tribute is chosen: Primrose Everdeen. Katniss volunteers in her behalf, and the male tribute – Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) is chosen. They are whisked to the Capitol, where they meet their mentor Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson), and Katniss meets her stylist, Cinna (Lenny Kravitz). Eventually, the time comes for the Games to begin, and the movie takes off from there.

The first day he came to school with me, it took forever for him to walk from the car into the center. And not because he had just started walking a few weeks earlier and was still a bit unsteady on his feet. He stopped for every new sound, movement or sight that caught his attention. A car drove past and he stopped to just stare at it. Once he was certain it was gone, he turned back to me and continued on until a college student approached so he stopped to watch him pass by as well. A bird tweeted and he stopped, looking around to see if he could find it. It was so hard not to rush him but, I gave him the time and space to take it all in. A month later, he still stops frequently to look around but it doesn't take us quite as long to get inside, provided he doesn't decide to test his limits and try to go in the opposite direction.

In each stanza of this poem, Levine uses the first two lines to state what seems like a random fact and then he uses the last two lines to add a sort of sarcastic, snarky or even just funny or interesting attitude or note about the fact previously stated. Most of the words he selects are either one or two syllables. This makes it feel simple as if he wants us to think these are just simple, separate facts and yet when read together they don’t seem so simple. I felt like I had been fed a bunch of facts and, yet, I was missing the point. Maybe that was the point. Maybe he wants us to question the facts.

I'm working on two novels right now, but none are close enough to print for me to talk about--but be prepared for more weird romance and some very strange sisters. I do have a short story in an anthology coming out from Candlewick next year. The collection is called Sideshow: Ten Original Tales of Freaks, Illusionists, and Other Matters Odd and Magical. My story is "The Mummy's Daughter". and if you have read my book Freaks, Alive, on the Inside! you'll guess who she's related to.

I used a Fiskars Threading Water punch for the punched border. The papers come with such wonderful quotes & I wanted to use these! So I cut one out, inked it a bit with Distress Fired Brick ink & it filled an area that was sort of empty!! I also added the same punched border for continuity.
That's great on some level, but I'm still very much underemployed and off of the grid. That's scary. It's also really frustrating because I've got the education, the skills and the experience. It makes me wonder how things would be different if I were a blond-haired and blue-eyed white female. Seeing articles like this doesn't help my perspective either: 1 in Every 4 Blacks is Underemployed, More Black Women Jobless. It's frustrating because with all I've done, let me get on the subway and you can feel the judgment based on nothing more than me being black, casually dressed and usually having an afro.
So what was the first thing I made with this tool? I made a Hello Kitty tiramisu cake! We were going to celebrate my mom's birthday a few weeks early since my brother was going to be in town, and since her favorite dessert is tiramisu I had been planning to make her tiramisu cake. And while I was unpacking all the goodies I had bought on vacation, I suddenly realized that I could use the pan sushi mold make the tiramisu instead!

Those that left were disproportionately wealthy. The average adjusted gross income for people leaving the state over that period was $44,700. Meanwhile, the average person moving into California posted income of just $38,600. Of course this is nothing new. The genuises running the state have known this for years. Over three quarters of a million taxpayers have fled the state since 1992, taking their skills, their jobs,their wealth with them to less greedy states that respect their work ethic.

Simply put, the “soul” is the primary gift of eternal life that God gives us all. But the “spirit” is what we make of our lives. Swedenborg claimed that the human soul was the first organic structure created by God and that its heavenly influence flowed down into the organic forms of the physical body and brain. The soul and its heavenly activities operate even above the consciousness of angels in the highest heaven.

Tommy Harper came out of California where he played high school ball with Willie Stargell and Curt Motton. He was all-league in both football and baseball at Encina Alameda High near Oakland and continued reaping league awards at San Jose Junior College. He then transferred to San Francisco State and was hitting over .500 when he was signed by the Reds in '60. He had a deceptively good first summer that year in B ball, hitting .254 while playing second, but with a .427 OBA, 65 runs, and 26 stolen bases in only 79 games. He spent '61 at the same level and position, boosting his average 70 points and showing some good power from his leadoff spot with 15 homers and 65 RBI's. The next year he jumped all the way to Cincy, starting the opener at third but after a few games was admittedly overwhelmed and sent down to Triple A the rest of the season. There Tommy had a big year, hitting .333 with 120 runs, 26 homers, 84 RBI's, and a .450 OBA while working on his game at third. The next season he went up for good.
Ultimately, wealth can only be made by human beings. This is what we mean by work - by hand and brain. So you could produce a model of an industry, a firm, a business of a harmonious group of people making, distributing, servicing (or whatever) and every day it produces a bit more wealth. This is how most politicians talk. All the talk about 'jobs' or 'growth' is rests on this idea that the people who own and run the firm are in the same boat as the people sitting at computers, driving trucks, working on production lines or whatever. And so, Ed Balls and George Osborne battle it out over who can make this happen so that there are more jobs and more growth.

Linguistic mirrors pass similar obscure judgements. Take language X, for example. Whether we know the language or not, when we say that it is a beautiful language because it is the language of love, we’re not judging the language: we’re judging love, because we do know that love is a beautiful thing. Language Y, in contrast, is a language of war, and hence ugly. Or conversely, of course. Some people love the smell of napalm any time of day.

Luff Imbry was another invention who grew in the telling. He began as a supporting character in Black Brillion. After it came out, I got a nice review of my early books from Nick Gevers, Jack Vance aficionado and co-editor of Postscripts, and when I got in touch he said he’d like to see a story from me. We talked about it a little and decided that Imbry had legs. I originally set out to be a crime writer, and only fell into writing science fantasy by accident (people kept telling me they’d buy novels or stories if I wrote them), and Imbry was an opportunity to create a real noir baddie. I think of him by the way, as much like Sydney Greenstreet’s character Kaspar Gutman in The Maltese Falcon, with a little Peter Ustinov stirred in.
Edit: In the process of uploading more pictures of the orphanage, but my modem is being very slow. I would also like to add that this orphanage is unlike any I have seen before. The mother of Omari, the sole caretaker of the children (with the help of volunteers), has made multiple efforts to keep the orphanage sustainable. There are dozens of chickens and a small garden which helps feed the 35 children between the ages of 2 and 17. As you can imagine, these efforts are great but not enough to support 35 children everyday.

Setting up an office in Reno is just one of many legal methods Apple uses to reduce its worldwide tax bill by billions of dollars each year. As it has in Nevada, Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places like Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the British Virgin Islands — some little more than a letterbox or an anonymous office — that help cut the taxes it pays around the world.

Deanna is not happy to be spending her summer with her French relatives in the middle of the country, with only the cat, Oliver, for company.

I am a big fan of the BLT and would love to shake the hand of whoever the genius was behind putting together this magical combination. A few weeks ago, I had a BLT craving. After I got home from the grocery store, I realized that I forgot to pick up tomatoes. It didn’t surprise me. I don’t go near the tomatoes at the grocery store, with the exception of maybe a pint of grape tomatoes every few months. I don’t like grocery store tomatoes at all, but a craving was a craving!
Me, I can drum up some passionate, angry sex without all the passion and anger. In fact, if there’s too much passion and anger outside of the bedroom, I just feel tired and a bit headachey in the bedroom, and I’d rather just go to sleep, thank you.

I talked to a couple of friends I knew that had home schooled or were currently and was lead to the Monterey County Charter Home School. I signed up for an orientation meeting and we all attended. After sitting through the meeting and then speaking to the presenter (a teacher) we "knew" this was the right fit for us right now. We signed up on the spot and Greg called her old school and dropped her while standing outside the office. BAM! We were home schooling.

But in this scenario, without using or threatening to use WMD, they declare independence. “Obama” orders state National Guard units in the region to mobilize and put down the rebellion, but they mutiny.

So your business has decided to voyage into the social media landscapes in search of additional channels of delivery and custom. Great decision! Although the barriers to entry are low, the barriers to success are high – this is already one aspect businesses seem to overlook. With such vast numbers being boasted by the social media domains, effectively utilising this space to meet your business objectives is becoming increasing more difficult. A simple comparison to use in demonstrating these difficulties is when a business relocates. There are new laws, codes of conduct, etiquette, morals and cultures.

This is a remake from 1919 and 1938 (“Storms in May”). Novel by famous Ludwig Ganghofer. I saw this yesterday on TV. The movie itself is quite good and is set around 1900. Good and typical alpine setting, but extremely few Lederhosen and few (good) sailor suit scenes. Though kids are often shown. Could be worse. Available on DVD. No clips on YouTube. English title “Thunderstorm in May”.

Here's the bad news. One of my learnings from my two days on max capacity is that the average lifespan of a woman (in Canada) is 83 yrs old. Which means we spend 1/3 of our lives in pre or post-menopause (which if you know nothing about is probably better as you'd probably contemplate the benefits of undergoing a sex change). One of the most common symptoms of menopause = insomnia. HA! Which means I have plenty of time to be a grouchy bitch in the last third of my life. YIPEE!

So, menopause is caused by ovarian failure and ovaries fail because they run out of eggs, and they run out of eggs because they start to use up more eggs than is necessary every month, and they begin to use more eggs because they aren’t getting what they need to function well. So, the big question is, what do ovaries need to function well? My hypothesis is that they need a variable semen cocktail (no pun intended) from multiple men who are familiar to her (no one night stands but from long term relationships, such as marriage) on a regular basis, and that this semen cocktail needs to be regularly varied so that not the same group of men contribute to it all the time, but a differently mixed semen cocktail is regularly received into the vagina, because this will keep the SSF activated and will regulate the ovaries, keeping them in perfect heath.

At this rate the GOP will end up on the dust heap of history. Young Americans are more tolerant, cosmopolitan, better educated, and more socially liberal than their parents. And relative to the typical middle-aged America, they are also more Hispanic and more shades of brown.

Miami Herald columnist Leonard Pitts Jr. wrote an article for the 05/06/12 edition entitled Trayvon ‘killed by stereotype’. Not withstanding the fact that Mr. Pitts makes his living as a writer by ferreting out any potential of racial conflict even where none may exist, he may be right to some degree. Stereotypes cannot kill. Ideas or thoughts cannot kill anymore than any inanimate object can kill without human intervention. Mr. Pitts’ article echoes a sentiment used as a reelection stunt by U.S. Representative Bobby Rush (D, Ill) and many others, stereotypes are not always true. A person may meet the characteristics of a given stereotype in terms of looks and maybe even action, but not be of type at all. This may have been the case in the Martin-Zimmerman tragedy, but that isn’t the point here.

The butternut squash lent a creamy texture to the pizza, and the zucchini — which was really small — added some nice color and flavor. Who knew that the Pope liked a vegetarian pizza?

And, of course, they’re broadly right, even if each one focuses on its own particular section of the industry rather than the wider picture. But what do you think are the chances that George Osborne will actually do anything to act on their suggestions? I would say much the same as those of a cat in hell. So all the public relations guys in these organisations must increasingly get the feeling that they are just going through the motions for the sake of it.

Sometimes ethical. In this case, the key is consideration of context: who would suffer if I were to die from a high-risk, optional behavior? If you’re single, and your parents aren’t relying on you for support, then it’s no big deal. Have a spouse? If she consents to your downhill biking, then that’s fine- she’s smart enough to know the risks. Have kids? No getting around this one- kids can’t comprehend the damage of losing a father at an early age. So, they can’t consent to the action, making it clearly unethical.

With the warming global waters you expect to see more marine life coming into inshore waters off Britain, and Cornwall has long been a spot for basking shark, killer whales, porpoise and dolphins, with regular sightings in the far West. It seems there've been fewer sightings of these creatures this year, although no one quite seems to know why. However the Western Morning News reports sightings of a serious predator a mile off St Ives: the whitetip shark, apparently one of the most vicious sharks in the world. There are frequent hoax shark sightings, but this was reported by two separate trawler crews (thank you R for this info). That'll panic us, then... The Wild always does.

While I have no desire to repeat what I’ve already said, I must expand upon my stated history a little for this inquiry to proceed.

Now to attaching it. If possible, choose thread that is sturdy and is a color match to your fabric. Work your way around the perimeter in small sections to sew the upholstered board through the caning and securing it on the other side with lots 'o knots and super glue. When sewing, you don't want there to be a huge stitch visible. Try to pass the needle back through as close as possible to where it came through the fabric, so you get something that looks more like ( . ) that instead of ( ------).

In reality, the opposite occurs, as Rena briefly finds herself in a position of great power thanks to Liana's no-nonsense stance against rape. Of course, the key word there is "briefly," as Rena squanders her power. Her obsession with torture causes her to not notice that her kingdom has been infiltrated by a chimp named Rocky. I know what you're thinking, he's just a chimp. Oh, but Rocky isn't your average chimp. Even Koukou winds up singing Rocky's praises ("Monkey free everybody!") when all is said and done. Not embarrassed in the slightest that they were rescued by a chimpanzee, Liana and friends seem glad to be free. I only wish I could say the same for the Amazonian warrior who looked exactly like Jenny Slate in a blonde wig, as she appeared sad. And you know what they say?

b. A return to dependence on God’s mercy is demanded (Psalm 51:7-12). There used to be a saying, “The Devil is no friend of grace.” We forget so easily that healing is only to be found in God’s grace and mercy. We, each of us, are in the midst of spiritual warfare. We are defenseless against Satan, against the world, and most of all, against our own evil flesh unless we depend on God’s grace.

At the same time, those who care about museum access might also see some cause for concern in this announcement. As part of these changes, the ROM is eliminating its two free hours per week, which were Wednesdays from 3:30 to 5:30pm. (Inconvenient and tokenistic as a time slot, I’ll admit. But my preference in terms of these announcement would have been to see these hours expanded and moved to an evening during the week.)

The first goal of the game was also by the Capitals , when a sequence of beautiful passing led to a goal by Mike Knuble. Joel Ward, Keith Aucoin and Mike Knuble had a 3 on 2 break, after Stu Bickel made the mistake of giving up the puck at the blue line. Less than five minutes later, Jason Chimera put the Caps up 2-0. After Matt Hendricks sent the puck deep into the Rangers zone, Lundqvist left the crease to play the puck before realizing he wasn’t going to recover in time. Chimera sent the puck to the crease where Hendricks had the opportunity to backhand it in between his legs but failed to do so. Chimera continued working the puck until it eventually went in off the skate of Ryan McDonagh. Sloppy goal, but the Capitals did take advantage of New York’s mistakes. The Rangers would get on the boards within the final minute of the period, when Brad Richards scored during a 4-on-4. Michael Del Zotto and Marian Gaborik had the assists.

He longs to shower it on you, so just receive. It’s yours for the taking. No strings attached. All He wants in return is your love and devotion to HIM! Have no other idols before Him and He will overwhelm you with His love.

Does this look better than just ok? It's a Kaffe stripe, I can't decide whether it's a good match or just ok. Which usually means that I should find something else, maybe a solid, or possibly scrappy, although I don't have much left of the fabrics I used in the quilt. Please help what do you think?

At the heart of the garden is the massive fountain, featured in the picture above. There are benches all around so you can watch the sprays change size and see if you can spot some of the resident ducks. One of the best features, especially when it gets hot and humid, is that the guards don’t mind if you put your feet in the fountain! Just don’t stand up and walk around or they’ll blow the whistle at you.
Corn is one of those funky foods. Though it definitely comes from a plant species, corn is technically a grain despite sometimes morphing into common usage as a vegetable. This all depends on how it's processed, prepared, and eaten. Hands down, most Americans consider it a vegetable because we eat it by the ton in its kernel form: either on or cut from the cob, or popped into the quintessential movie house snack. Yet we tend to take it for granted as flour starch to thicken our gravies, or as meal to bake up those marvelously crumbly muffins which brighten our breakfast tables. No Southern U.S. menu would be complete without yet another refinement of grain corn: the much-beloved, porridge-dense grits.

“Don’t worry, Little Thomas is going to save Big Thomas” Tevye told me. He drove his train until he reached the one that was reportedly “stuck” on my hat. When the magnets had connected, he backed up with the derailed train in tow. This went on a few more times and then we did our usual Going-To-Bed Routine.
"... offers a three-day workshop for shy bladders, held monthly in cities in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. It costs $300 to attend. The first day is a group counseling session. During the second day, attendees gorge themselves on water and then, in pairs, practice voiding in their hotel bathrooms. In this exercise, one man stands at the toilet while a partner stands a comfortable distance behind him. As the first man begins to urinate, his partner inches closer, eventually standing directly behind the man, sometimes touching or razzing him as he urinates, to re-create the feel of a busy public restroom. The closing event of the workshop, which Soifer calls the "graduation ceremony," is held in a bathroom at a train station, airport, or, occasionally, a ballpark." - Bryan Curtis; Slate Magazine

Turns out I have a special talent for arcade games. Specifically the ones with toys, and other prizes. The tickets/points ones, not so much (the only tickets I won were the games for the little kids. Since I’m taller than the whole thing, I can easily put the ball in the hole….most of the time)

Etching on copper is a new concentration and I seem to be drawn to a fern/kelp motif. These etched discs are in the process of getting enameled and if I have time before the show (eeek!) etching the enamel so it's not so shiny may be in order. Apologies for the supadupa shiny copper, this is just a quick shot to show my progress. Those little round discs on the left are part of trying to figure out what color to use- so many choices. The counter enamel is now on the back side of the discs and after I clean the firescale off the front, they'll be ready for a couple more layers of enamel.
I'm sure everyone of you out there with young teenage girls know about the TV show, H2O . The one about the Mermaids? Well, of course my 11 year old now wants to be a Mermaid for Halloween. Heck, I think she even wants to be a Mermaid when she grows up!
Beautifully written, with a complex and original storyline, this story takes us through the lives of Hephzibah and Rebecca, two twins, one beautiful the other disfigured, when one of them suddenly dies. They cope with abuse, love, and death, and create a story out of this world. One of the twins tells the story after her sister’s death and the other the history before. There are so many twists and turns as you learn the mystery of Hepzhi’s death, and though I didn’t cry, this story moved me powerfully.
The equipment used in these facilities was anything but high-tech. Most brand-new weaponry was used on the Eastern front, while those manning the Atlantikwall often had to make do with near-obsolete WW1-vintage equipment, much of which had been requisitioned from occupied territories such as France, Russia, Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands. Further north, British-made equipment was even found to have been used by German forces in Dunkerque and Dieppe!

I like the last section of this first chapter quite a bit. Nhat Hanh advocates that we should look deeply, which means that “the distinction between observer and observe disappears” (11). Do you suppose this is what Jesus meant when he said, “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing”? Are we to look into Jesus so intently that we become indistinguishable from him? Is that how we can learn to change the world?
Her doctor told her 4 weeks ago, "If I looked at the charts I would say your condition is worse, but you are showing an unexpected and impossible improvement in your movement, speech, and overall condition..I am betting the virus I injected is taking hold" and Marissa replied, "You believe that and I am believing I am healed and whole by the hand of God". If this is not improvement, I don't know what is.
Three elements combine to make the Institute unusual, if not unique: it has the independence of being entirely self-financing, with no subsidies from the government or other sources; the action research orientation places it between, but not in, the worlds of academia and consultancy; and its range of disciplines include anthropology, economics, organizational behavior, political science, psychoanalysis, psychology and sociology.

And, in Akron, turn to the Creator for “Divine Help” is exactly what they reported they had done. Many, including Bill Wilson, Dr. Bob, and AA Number Three specifically reported they had been cured by reliance on the Creator. No revisionist, secular, universalist writings can change that! See: Dick B., God and Alcoholism: Our Growing Challenge in the 21st Century; Cured: Proven Help for Alcoholics and Addicts; When Early AAs Were Cured and Why; Richard K., Early A.A. – Separating Fact from Fiction: How Revisionists Have Led Our History Astray; So You Think Drunks Can’t Be Cured: Press Releases By Witnesses To the Cure; A New Light: “The First Forty” (All three titles: Haverhill, MA: Golden Text Publishing Company, 2003).
Over in the land of Evil, Tae Mu gets a call. Tae Yong has been found in Chicago. He gets a photo of him in a somewhat vegetative state. What I want to know is how his body got there. Did he swim? Because if he was fished out in New York with no identity, why would he be sent to Chicago? And who’s taking care of him?
Now add a proprietor, Shelley MacBeth, that works tirelessly with her neighbouring independents, food store, clothing store etc., to draw people to the main street and I think Chapters, Barnes and Noble or even the big box store could learn a thing or two.

For the past 5 years I have worked with various health care practitioners. I consider myself well informed regarding the various equipment modalities used by most doctors. I have to humbly admit that I didn’t have a clue how complicated Meridian therapy can be! I needed help learning what the AcuGraph does and how it helps practitioners! One of the first things I did was watch every one of the 12 DVD’s in Dr. Larsen’s amazing Seminar series called Digital Meridian Analysis for Better Acupuncture Results.
Oh and I should mention that all of the people at my new company are super nice. Everyone seems motivated to do a good job and keep the little agency running at top speed.
At the root of all that we have said about worship is a single thought. It is this: The God who saves us in his mercy also is the God who makes demands on our lives. The question we ask is this: Does God have a right to make any demand, let alone this demand? I think part of the problem with the way we do church is precisely at this point. When we do evangelism, for example, we are happy to let people know that Jesus died for their sins, that he wants to set them free, that he will help them in their difficulties—maybe even heal them of illness and disease, and that he will be a great pal through the many changes that occur in life.

But there are a few countries around the world that are exceptions to this trend -- that is, although Korea does not interact with them all that frequently, Koreans nonetheless have a relatively concrete feeling toward them. Turkey is one of those countries.
Fellas if you are with a woman that is constantly trying to prove her desirability to you by flirting with other men or responding to men who are openly flirting with her in front of you, drop the biatch like a bad habit (she is a bad habit) b/c there is nothing worse in the world than an insecure woman (or man) in a LTR needing and seeking validation from others.

But, for these novice runners, a sound training program (not some 12-week “miracle” run your marathon program) which progresses over 5 months or more in fact should incorporate enough quality work that indeed races even as short as the mile (1500m) or 5k can have dramatic improvements! I have had many such runners.
Conversation with spirits (saying they need human blood to suck!) and frightening dream visitations by spirits are part of occult communication. Meyer’s spiritual experiences could well be influenced by her Mormon faith which allows for communication with the so-called "the dead"; indeed "the dead" of former generations are baptized into Mormonism in Mormon Temple ritual. Mormon founder Joseph Smith was "visited" by a communicating "angel" called Moroni, whose statue stands atop all Mormon Temples. This fallen angel of Mormonism gave Smith messages on which he formed his Mormon doctrine about prior civilizations, none of which have been discovered despite endless archeological digs to substantiate Mormons claims. Others Mormon teachings conflict with biblical Christianity such as Mormonism's claim that Jesus of the Bible is the half-brother of Satan.

I've learned a lot. And as I put my notebook away and Fergus celebrates his victory by producing some very special Adnams' beers that are possibly older than he is, Sam, he and I discuss the action. In the room it's 4-0 to beer with one draw - and this was not a room full of beer geeks, but a balanced audience of foodies who, if anything, might be expected to go with the wine. I'm happy because beer is the winner. But I did emphatically prefer the wine in one course, so my palate's conscience is clear.
Race may be a social construction, but it continues to have real consequences upon people’s lived experiences. I know that my experiences as a biracial Asian American boy growing up in the Los Angeles of the ‘70s, ‘80s and early ‘90s (I graduated from high school just a few scant months after the National Guard used our blacktop as a staging area) will be very different from my daughters’ experiences as multiethnic Asian American girls growing up in a more conservative, more homogeneous Central Valley in the early 21st century. But I know that having a biracial black man in the White House and mixed folks a Hollywood trend doesn’t equal the end of racism, and that colorblindness leaves us unable to see, and that sometimes it isn’t enough to just love our children and hope for the best but that we must equip them with the lessons of our past, the tools with which they can shape their world, and our guidance with which they can learn to do so.
"Not much," admitted Sam. "I remember those twins and going down to the beach in the summertime. Mum was always practicing archery so it was just us." Sam had loved those days by the water with the twins. Once, her precious stuffed bunny Sunny had gotten caught in the tide and Eli dove in to rescue her, even though it was dangerous. His mother and father shouted up a storm, despite the fact they were champion swimmers and had taught Eli themselves. Once they stopped yelling, Sam had given Eli a hug. She hoped he was still there.

Does it even make sense to include the Valleys in something called 'Urban Trawl'? They don't fit the pattern of any other rural or urban settlement in the UK. These long rows of terraces, distributed along steep, scarred and verdant hills, are obviously too dense and industrial to be 'the countryside', no matter how gorgeously they might nestle in those undulations; they're largely too small, too bounded to feel like towns as commonly understood. They could be considered one great big town, parted by billowing topography. You'd be either a fool or very poor to attempt to negotiate it without a car. Linking the Valleys together coherently could only work via expensive, dramatic solutions – an underground railway, a system of funiculars. The place does get some investment. Since the mines were crushed in the 1980s, with the steelworks gradually following suit, call centres and local government offices filled the gap; talk of remaking them into Silicon Valleys came to little. The Valleys are often so beautiful that you could imagine them one day becoming tourist centres, but snobbery checks that. High architecture, especially of the twentieth century, has touched them little, although there are remarkable finds to be had.
So, I blog instead, and then I'm going to cry some more, and then maybe someday someone I don't know will keel over immediately after deciding that they should leave all of their money to me.

The reason for this is that as white people, unless they are gay (since October 2009), disabled or, in some limited circumstances, female, are not a “protected class” under US anti-discrimination legislation, they are therefore, not protected by the current hate crimes legislation, and, as such, can not be the victim of a hate crime.

"Completely out of the blue, a week ago Sunday, and the very day before Karla died, I had my one and only opportunity to see Karla perform. The ease with which it all unfolded, and the total absence of any fanfare, belied the delicate surprise that I was privileged to witness. Just like the old days, Karla performed with Beth and I got to witness many years after the fact, the same family magic that I'd only seen in pictures and heard about in stories around the dinner table. The rehearsal up in the Johnson's apartment was easy, casual. Our daughter Abby stood behind Karla and brushed her hair while and Avery sat with me and her Grandfather on the couch as Karla and Beth sight-read an arrangement of a song they hadn't performed together since they were in their early teens. When they performed in the chapel later that afternoon, for most people in the audience it was just a lovely little afternoon performance, but for me it was like seeing a reunion concert of the Everly Brothers, and it was as I'd been transported back to another time. There was Karla, at last, not looking like a 45 year old woman, but just like in the pictures in family albums I'd seen of her as a little girl, just a bit nervous, shifting her weight slightly from foot to foot, a little too far off mike, but blending in somehow perfectly, on pitch and in tune. The sound of the two of them together was easy and beautiful.
While we're on the topic, are there any other unrecognized triumphs by the Gracey-Crump team in the Mansion? There is possibly another small one, a very small one. More than likely, it's a coincidence. It depends on whether Rolly had anything to do with choosing the wrought iron pattern for the Mansion exterior. It's a standard, off-the-shelf style known as "Bird of Paradise." It has a little bird's head woven into the pattern, easily missed. A bird's head, that is, on a reptilian neck snaking out of a plant. Like I said, probably coincidental, but that thing reminds me of the Museum of the Weird. He even has the Look. He's got attitude, his thoughts are elsewhere, he's in his own world, and he's a little sinister.

But why do I like him enough to read and re-read him? We have had a long relationship, Dickens and I, but one thing I have always liked about him is that his dates are so easy to remember: 1812-70 and I have real trouble with dates, which is a drawback for a History Girl. I know things like the deposition of Richard 11 (1399) and Battle of Bosworth Field (1485) but that's really because of an obsession with Shakespeare (1564-1616) and currently the Plantagenets.

Michelle Bachman announcing her support today is just a token move to offer the olive branch from the Tea Party.
