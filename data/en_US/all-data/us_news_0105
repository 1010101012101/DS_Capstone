Saturday synopsis
Quite unintentionally, we picked two almost perfectly complementary items from the list of 'snacks" that can serve as appetizers, small plates or cheap augmentation of dorm food. Nopal salad ($5), although it contains minced bits of jalapeño, was a mild combination of strips of cactus and slices of avocado whose most notable flavoring is lime. Maize con limón ($3) also used lime as a flavoring, but more as an undertone to the chile fire that flavored a bowl of hominy. Individually, I might have found one dish too bland and the other too bold, but alternating bites of each worked remarkably well.

Hitting its prime in the 1970s, the section was designated as a blue-ribbon trout fishery by the Arizona Game and Fish Department in 1981.

Bolstered by healthy runoff in recent years, the river once again looks to be living up to its potential.

The quick take: The temptation is to go with a leaner, more herbaceous white. But often they're too lean for the rest of the plate (and the season). Many of the dry aromatic whites will work - not just the Alsatian-style wines but also more obscure varietals like Sylvaner and Kerner. Or try Austrian Gruner Veltliner and dry Riesling.

This week Maryland's Catholic bishops, men of deeply help moral and theological convictions, issued a call to their parishioners and to the public to protect freedom of religion in Maryland ("Bishops assail same-sex marriage," Nov. 10).

Freeholder Rob Walton, who is a former mayor of Hampton, said there will be some traffic problems created for local residents. “The bridge project is going to create havoc for more Hampton than Glen Gardner because of the ways the roads are structured. In general they are going to have to realign how traffic flows through Route 31 from the Glen Gardner border and just past that bridge for the better part of two years,” he said. “I think it needs to get done, I think you’ll find with this temporary fix that it will create several problems both anticipated and not anticipated,” Walton said, although he says that the trade-off would be worth it.
Excerpt: The United States team is left with new fans back home, fans who recognized the national warriors in Abby Wambach and Hope Solo, fans who embraced new cult heroes like the 22-year-old Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe (a reader described her lithe, blond presence as “a wood elf”) who made another magnificent pass to set up Morgan’s goal but was subbed out with the United States ahead in the 114th minute. It’s hard to blame the American coach, Pia Sundhage, since she was the one who inserted Rapinoe before other grand moments earlier in the tournament.

Ms. Mossburg then makes an even bigger jump of irrational thought — "A more powerful government is destined to more often make bigger and worse mistakes." Would she prefer no government?

Of course, quiet efforts can also fail. There are never any guarantees. But still, it was a nice surprise to start the New Year with news that Israelis and Palestinians had their first face-to-face meeting in 16 months.

Parties seeking comebacks after devastating failures invariably follow a model with a strong track record: push the ideological envelope, lose, tack back to the middle, reap the rewards.

What's the solution? One of the biggest things we could do is to create a culture that affirms the great worth of fatherhood. Women are now more likely to give their husbands more marital slack if they play an active role in parenting -- and men are also happier if they take a hands-on role in the home.

Every single individual in this state can bring a lawsuit if they think it's unfair. If they think it favors one ethnicity or one party we have to defend it.

Stern: We'll see. But the one thing I can say to you is that the new collective bargaining agreement will speak to that with each passing year more forcefully, because what I also said to you when last we met was that as the new tax levels become effective, there will be a limitation on what any team can add.

In recent surveys, about two-thirds of Americans approve of the idea that pastors shouldn't endorse candidates, and indeed many believe that they shouldn't be able to even speak on issues from the pulpit (the latter restrictions would violate the 1st Amendment, of course).

This is the main cause of huge "structural" budget deficits, meaning that they aren't simply a hangover from the recession.

The partners bring serious firepower to the second half of that equation. On the high-proof side: Thad Vogler (a 2009 Bar Star) and Eric Johnson (Heaven's Dog, Delarosa). Mark Ellenbogen, the ringleader of the Bay Area wine avant-garde, handles the lower-proof portion. Andreas Willausch (Farmhouse Inn) runs the front of the house. And Brandon Jew (Magnolia Pub) helms the kitchen; his nightly menus are testament to the farm-small mandate implied in the bar's name. The competing priorities of plates, stemware and swizzle sticks often collide, but here they're in perfect harmony.

Matt Goodman has a not-so-secret identity. A dermatologist by day, he is also the president of the 3,700-member, eight-congregation Orange Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (often referred to as the Mormons).

Portland Golf Club has unmatched tournament history in this state, with some of the game's greatest names involved. It was the site of the 1946 PGA Championship (won by Ben Hogan), 1947 Ryder Cup and a regular PGA Tour event, the Portland Open, which ran briefly in the 1940s (Sam Snead and Hogan won), then was resurrected in 1959 for eight years, with

Many Illinois sustainability and environmental groups--including the Illinois Coalition for Clean Air and Water, Mercy for Animals and the Humane Society of the U.S.--hope this will not be the case and have pledged to make their voices heard as Illinois holds hearing on its own similarly-aimed Animal Facilities Bill HB5143 on Wednesday. Illinois recently launched an online program where citizens can register their support or opposition on "witness slips" even if they don't attend the hearing. They can be filled out for that bill here.

Two days later at practice, James openly disagreed with how his head coach handled the situation. Ilgauskas steamed and said nothing. Brown said he was sorry and refused to discuss any demand Ilgauskas may have made, accepting the entire blame. In the next game, a home victory against the Phoenix Suns, Ilgauskas did break the record, and he did it while leading the Cavs with 14 points. When he came in the game, he received a standing ovation and nearly cried on the spot. But he asked not to be recognized and refused to take questions from reporters afterward.

Charles Fisher, a 79-year-old retired advertising executive living in Dublin, Ohio, says his adult daughter sometimes presses him to take driver-safety courses but he doesn't feel the need. He is fit, alert and confident of his abilities. A father of four, Mr. Fisher says he and his wife, Lee, used to drive thousands of miles coast to coast for vacations or family visits. But Ms. Fisher, 73, no longer drives, and Mr. Fisher has cut his mileage to about 200 miles a week. He has his vision checked annually; two weeks ago his doctor upgraded his driving glasses. To avoid night driving, the couples goes to movie matinees and dines out before dark. His mantra is, "Remember you're not the only fool on the road," he says.

Those on the ground in Eugene suspect that the university knows it has to do something about the half-court line and will make that adjustment without publicly acknowledging it.

If all of this sounds a bit like construction on the New Meadowlands is still in progress -- and it will continue to be during the summer concert season -- consider that the old Giants Stadium hasn't been completely demolished yet.
