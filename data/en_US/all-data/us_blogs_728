and then all over again.
Perhaps it is the height of selfishness, but I hope that there is something of me in the presents I give, whether it is store-bought or hand-made. I would like my gifts to reflect a value that I share with others, not one that is assigned by retailers and advertisers. For the past few years, I have been making items - knitted hats and scarves, homebaked treats - to give as presents on holidays and special occasions, and I continue to do so this Christmas. These gifts are tangible, to be enjoyed by taste or by feel, but they also hold intangible wishes for even more cherished things that I hope we all receive in abundance. With just three days left before Christmas, I'd like to share some of these gifts within gifts with you.
Note that some amount of evidence obtained in this manner will be required to secure a conviction in a case, unless the culprit, identified in whatever fashion, can be induced to confess, and, further, that the chances of said confession taking place in the absence of any such evidence may be rather slim. Also note that much evidence obtained via the bottom-up sweep will be confirmatory in nature. Obtaining fingerprints of the culprit in a given case will be of no value in tracking him down (unless their fingerprints are already on a fingerprint database, a possibility I ignore here to make the point), but of great value in convincing a jury of their guilt if they can be tracked down by some other means. Similarly, finding a shell casing from the firearm used in a homicide will not lead the police to the killer, but may help them secure a conviction against that killer if he can be identified by some other means and arrested with the firearm in question located conveniently in his bedside cabinet. Not for nothing do such types tend to dispose of weapons after use.
The financial aid that your client with unfinished credit history receives will take time and effort to get to him. Poor credit payday Loans function contrary to this. By using this economic center, it is possible to resolve your credit rating errors with necessary capital. The money concerns the client inside of 24 hours without any discomfort. Until eventually his following cash advance, an adult paid school man or woman are able to use the obtained hard cash to everything and anything from it.
But here's one preview so far:
When Harry and I decided to meet for lunch for the first time, we went dutch. He didn’t so much as hold my hand that time. We were strictly friends. And when I got out my credit card case that business card kind of fell out and I explained to him when I got it and how for some reason I wasn’t able to get rid of it. He said, “Well maybe someday when you fall in love again you will be able to let it go.” And I agreed that it would probably take that. We had that conversation on April 1st. The same date two years earlier Martin had picked me up from the airport on my first trip to England and told me he got the job in America.
Hello. My name is Mona Burnett, and I am Brenna's Mom!!! I have recently become a stampin up demonstrator also!! After she joined and I saw all the great benefits she was getting, I decided to take the plunge and become a demosntrator myself! woo hoo!! I wanted to showcase my work also, but don't have a blog and have found myself somewhat technologically challenged...so I proposed a sharing of Brennas blitherings. I have noticed that she has been sort of slacking in the posting area also...ha ha ha...hopefully between the two of us we can have a nice little blog with tons of Stampin' Up card and 3D item inspiration!!!

For example, how could the Heritage Minister, through the Arts Council, ensure that this is supported by the Welsh Government. Could those in charge of BBC Wales consider how they could use their vast expertise and facilities to support such a concept?
“I hope we can move forward on these [West Side] projects,” he said. “I fear we’re in more trouble than we’re letting on.” (He noted that it was news to him that the hearing brought out the city’s commitment to spend up to $3.5 billion on the #7 line, given that he'd previously criticized the city for committing to only $2.1 billion.) He said he was recessing rather than closing the hearing, given that he hoped Port Authority representatives would testify as well.
The muddy riverside path narrows between dense hawthorn and sloe, the latter berried with fruits the colour of midnight, then leaves the waterside to emerge onto Westminster Field on the edge of Horton Kirby. Football teams in bright fluorescent bibs are practising, shouts of encouragement and derision in equal proportion echoing around the playing field. Beyond the field, the footpath weaves through a kissing gate and across a rough meadow to meet the river bank once more. Now the path twists beneath the crowns of sycamores, amongst scrubby corky-barked elm, surrounded by drab earthy tones: the mud beneath my feet, overlain with a veneer of fading buff fallen leaves; the grey-green lichen-coated tree trunks; the pebbledash of chalky pebbles visible beneath the gin-clear waters of the Darent; the chocolate and chestnut coats of the horses mooching in an adjacent damp field. Only the vivid pink-orange seed capsules of spindles provide any splash of colour.
Thanks for stopping by today! Have a great day!
Here I am going beyond Putnam (undoubtedly an unwise thing to do!), because Putnam helps himself to mental content even as he argues that mental content alone is not sufficient to determine meaning. But if meaning, understood as “wide content,” turns out to be a description of relationships between persons and environments then there cannot be any mental content. There are no propositions transcendently emanating from Platonic heaven whether or not some person adopts an attitude towards them. There are only specific, concrete instances of states of affairs (I will use “states of affairs” as a more economical way of saying “relationships between persons and their environments;” this is consistent with the more standard use of the phrase as referring to ways the world could be) and goal-directed, token incidents of language-use.
This is going to be a horribly tricky area in coming years. Recently I spoke to the Mother of a boy who had been living with his first ever serious girlfriend for about 18 months. The boy and the girlfriend then split up for approximately six weeks, then got back together for another eight months before the boy announces to his Mother that the relationship with his girlfriend is over and he is going to move out. That weekend, before actually moving out, he is drowned in a boating accident. The girlfriend says that the six week breakup was just them taking some "Space" and that the boy certainly had not told her that it was over.
It’s well known that New Year’s resolutions don’t have a high success rate. So why do we continue to make resolutions every year even though so few of us follow through?
It’s frustrating to know someone might blow things out of proportion (by disseminating the information), or get too involved by trying to rule your head (by bashing things up “don’t do that, it’s stupid!”).

Tomorrow should make for something of a muddy visit but we need to cast a critical eye over the finishes that will soon be applied throughout and the furniture that will accompany them. And time permitting we’ll be planting both a greengauge and an apple tree next to where we intend the ‘hort’ to be. Let’s hope the skies clear!
The remainder of the day on Monday after the official events were over, as well as Tuesday, were enjoyable but not particularly eventful as far as spiritual activities or incidents went–which is fine, considering there was such an abundance of them in the days preceding. I returned home on Wednesday morning, and as I flew out of the Bay Area, I was finally able to see the Golden Gate Bridge from the air; and as I approached the airport where I was landing, I could see my island home very clearly from above. Not surprisingly, when I returned, the entire area of western Washington state was under flood warnings, and there were huge parts of Skagit Valley that were quite soggy with standing water as I passed through them back to my home. Apparently, the Inundations were happening for places that are important to me outside of PantheaCon as well…
I pretty much just endure the rest of the year in order to get to the best part...October through December! Face it, the best holidays occur during this time, the air is crisp, the mosquitoes have gone to bed, I don't have to cut the yard and I can break out the cute boots and sweaters! But most of all, I can decorate the entire house and cook all my favorite cool weather recipes (maybe I'm weird but I have recipes I only cook in the summer and others I only cook in the fall/winter months)...you know, all those yummy apple and pumpkin desserts, stews, soups and turkey!!!
I hope you're having a great Mother's Day. You are the best mom! You take care of me when I'm sick, you, volunteer at school. You're awesome! When I said that you deserved a Coke I really meant it. You are the best mom in the world! Love, Grace
At the end of the nineteenth century, a woman’s group called the St. Vincent’s Aid Society learned that Catholic patients were not receiving proper treatment, respect, or courtesy in the city hospitals, and invited the order of the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul to build a Catholic charity hospital in Austin. The Society purchased, for $5,300, a 4 1/2 acre tract of land called “Tobin Park,” located between Twenty-sixth, Rio Grande, and Nueces, and ground was broken on the structure in the spring of 1901.
I have stewed and stewed over this race recap, and I figured there is just no way I can explain to you the experience, so I'll just give you the best overview I can. The New Years Double was thought up, developed, and directed by a friend of mine, Libby Jones (no we're not related!). Two races - New Years Eve and New Years Day. Four distances - 5k, 2-person Half Marathon Relay, Half Marathon, and Marathon. You could do any combination of the available distances on the available days.
Having left Chala to fanny about in shops with Thangor I headed off on a quest to avoid hearing any football scores, whilst also drinking to keep the thoughts at bay. Choice one, at midday, didn't herald any scores but did at least prove a poor idea in terms of avoiding Football details.

There are two principal reasons for a publisher to refuse a book: it's crap and always will be; it's still crap but you could have made it OK. Oh, and there's a third - you sent them a book that is not the type they publish, or that they already have with a slightly different title. There's nothing you can do about the last bit except look at their catalogue and make sure they haven't just printed a book that is pretty much the same. The others are all in your control. (Most of this is covered wonderfully by the Crabbit Bat Nicola Morgan on Help! I Need a Publisher - write the right book at the right time in the right way and send it to the right publisher.)

From here, the game jumps back in time as you begin your march into the city. It’s here that you’ll learn the basic controls and get into the flow of the game. At its core, you’re going to be using cover to stay alive. It’s not as intuitive as a game like Gears of War or Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, but it’s easy to use and works well. With those other games conditioning me to the idea of a roadie run moving from cover, sadly this one doesn’t have it. Walker can move quickly, but he’s no Marcus Fenix or Ghost in that regard. His moveset when in cover just doesn’t seem as tactical as those other games.
Of course now we hear that FFP will not be happening quite as planned, even though we have seen Portsmouth enter administration for the third time, essentially because the clubs are not prepared to clean up their acts. The Football League has been side-lined but so has all governance of the game as the Football Association has ceded control to rich owners of increasingly powerful clubs.

These are generally medium to full bodied stouts that have an unreal smoothness to them from the addition of oats to the mash. The oats not only add a lot of smoothness to the mouth feel but give a touch of sweetness that is unlike any other type of stout. Both levels of roasted flavor and hop character will vary. Ours is very smooth and delicious – the accent is on the malt – this batch was Nitrogenated to make it oh, so creamy.
This week has gone by SOOOOOOO slow. I can't even tell you how slow. The reason? We have not-so-patiently been waiting to find out where we'll be moving this summer! I've mentioned before, hubby has been in an Oral Maxillofacial Surgery residency for the past (almost) four years and is now just four months away from being done...YAY! I can't believe we've almost made it! He's in the Air Force so we know it's time for a transfer to take place, but we don't know where his new assignment is yet. We were told we would know by the end of February but that obviously didn't pan out. Now, we hear we should find out today sometime (hopefully...no guarantee I suppose). I've been doing anything I can to keep myself distracted while waiting for the phone call...I even resorted to cleaning and organizing yesterday! I spent about 5 hours going through a few areas of my house. It feels good to get the ball rolling on spring cleaning at least!
We've been a Suzuki family since Benny was 3. When Sadie was born she began attending his lessons in the baby sling, and by the age of two she had a foam-a-lin under her chin. The best thing about Suzuki, for us, has been the teachers: their willingness to accept children as individuals, their patience and faith in their method, and their positive, forward energy. But after 8 years of toil along the Suzuki path to enlightenment (and Benny's path has not been without thorns and potholes) I felt like we needed to step outside the program, and try something new.

Adults have a difficult time wrapping their heads around this. But usually those fears also stem from the worry that their child will be too different from other kids, or they'll appear to be neglectful parents. It's easier to follow the herd. I totally get that. That's why you'll see unschoolers hugging and jumping up and down in glee when they get together - SOMEONE LIKE ME! It ain't easy to paddle against the current, lemme tell ya.

Or how about Magistrate Tsotsi Ronnie Rambau (the name “Tsotsi” says it all) who was arrested for corruption and later arrested again for conspiracy to commit murder after the police found a hit list in his own handwriting of the names of people involved in his corruption trial.

So began my life-long attachment to the boiled egg, though nothing has ever come close to that moment of transcendence. Maybe it’s because it’s so easy to be distracted nowadays. The act of standing over a pan of gently bubbling water for precise minutes requires a presence of mind, a slower heartbeat perhaps. An over-boiled egg is rarely uneatable – even with grey yolk and a sulphurous ring of shame – but a runny egg, the white still translucent, the yolk thin and watery, is not simply a disappointment but a waste. Perhaps we have become too removed from what Henry James called the “bloom of punctuality.” We no longer have any concept of the laying season, where we must wait for the hen – everything is available so nothing really matters.
Now these are probably not that spicy, but my palate tends to favor the more mild end of the spectrum. So for normal humans, these are probably just the right taste of spice to a sandwich. For me, and the manchild, probably not.
When I journal privately, I tend to ask precisely this kind of (almost) rhetorical question. I find that living out the answers is difficult. The even-more challenging thing is to live into the questions.

As far as investors are concerned, (FASB has) have eliminated (standards). There is essentially no oversight of companies by accountants any longer. Accounting statements are all but worthless. Frauds like Enron, Lehman Brothers and Overstock.com are everywhere. Companies can hide risk from investors, misstate earnings without fear of reprisal, engage in any manner of deceptive gamesmanship.

This power struggle comes from two different, but related, places in our life. First of all, it is our sin nature that wants to crown us Lord of all. There is only one God and we are not Him, so this creates natural tension and messes things up. Second of all, it is a result of ignorance. If people really were students of the Word of God, they would see how important it is to keep God as the center of our life. We would see that the only firm foundation is in Jesus Christ, not in our own strength or abilities. The other thing is that there are so many examples of people in the Bible who have gone on ahead of God and have had very serious problems happen to them.
The accountants charged with the inquiry into the affairs of Messrs Pattison, limited, do not expect that they will he able to finish their report until tonight. The meeting of bank managers, which was to have been held in Edinburgh to-day to consider the report, has therefore been postponed until to-morrow or Monday. The accountants, who it is understood, will present a report favourable to the Company, will recommend a scheme of reconstruction. Nothing regarding the report will be given to the press until after the meeting of the bank managers. "

What’s your greatest weakness? It’s an obnoxious question but you’ll hear it on the majority of job interviews in your life, and there are many others where it came from. (There’s plenty of debate on how to answer this question. I’ve always found the best strategy is to pick a skill you are actually bad at that sounds relevant to the job but really isn’t. Then you come across as honest but your weakness won’t hurt you.) You have to answer the questions if you want to get the job, so there are two things you want to do: understand the motivation behind the questions and prepare your answers in advance. Understanding the motivation is generally as simple as putting yourself in the company’s shoes. Why would they want to know your greatest weakness? Probably more to know how you respond to a question that asks you to be vulnerable than to actually find out where you can improve. They may also ask because they want to know if you can realistically gauge your abilities accurately. Once you consider the motivation behind these common questions it’ll be easier to tailor the answers you want to give. You don’t want to script them out and memorize them in advance, of course, but developing a list of sound bites can help you go in prepared while still being able to provide natural responses.
I finished Trine 2 a little while ago and it is one of those rare games where I haven’t played its predecessor. Even though I haven’t personally played through the first Trine, I have watched it being played in its entirety, so I do know the story behind it.

She accepts the darkness of her life, the darkness of the world outside her globe. And she knows that there is a spot in her own cosmos where a light always lit and she feels joy as she soaks up its warmth. She doesn’t know who lit the light but she feels no loneliness anymore. Her focal point is the fire where life exists instead of cold death as in the darkness.
As I’ve written many times before, I’m only interested in what sounds like conspiracy fact. There are conspiracies everywhere, but 99.9% of them are designed to disguise or re-brand a cockup. And 99.9% of conspiracy theories are, in turn, just that: an assemblage of random facts made to look like some kind of plan.

And that’s especially true because, unless I am completely misreading the signs, Slim Girl is a prostitute. Or at the very least, she uses sexuality to get herself money and favors from men. I don’t have any proof from the novel yet that she consummates any of these relationships, but if not she certainly is leading a man to believe she will. I have to admit, I was pretty shocked by this revelation, especially as La Farge drops it in slowly and casually, as if to say “Oh, how does she make her money? Well, let’s say a lot of gentlemen know her. Know her well, if you catch my drift.” Though not the title character, it feels like her story at this point, less than half-way into the novel: her story of how she grows closer to a native heritage she’s lost (but awakens to as she gets to know the strong young man she has married), her story of how she balances worlds (she dreams that the money she earns can be turned to profit by her new husband, whose artistry and craft can turn a little silver into beautiful artifacts and jewelry—she thinks they can become rich and then go away to live together in happiness), her story of how a young woman can gamble her whole self and lose. Because I don’t see how she, living perilously close to scandal in the white world and already a scandal to “her people” as she is, can hope to win. And I wonder if Laughing Boy will be brought low along side her, in the process. He seems loyal and kind, and utterly bewitched by her personality (even more than by her beauty). Such things are tragic flaws in fiction, as often as not. For the first time in a while, on this Pulitzer run, I think this is a novel some of you should go read….head to your library and get that ILL department working for you!
1 :: Tissue poms galore! I'd been having a hard time deciding what I wanted to do for decor. I didn't really want to plaster the alphabet all over the walls. I didn't want to just do tissue poms or something of that nature over the dessert table, because it was essentially what we did last year. But then I came across this photo from an Animal Parade Party by Paper & Ink. I was sold. I wanted to cover my entire ceiling in tissue poms, and exchange the animals for letters. I told my mom the plan, she definitely thought I was joking. I was not. :o) Anyway, this party was a huge inspiration for me.

A LOL worthy jab at the Conservative spin machine, from McMaher:
Harrumph. Your error is in assuming that all (or any) of this theory was consciously thought out. Of course it was not. But remember this: you can't tell even the simplest joke without implying a whole world in which such a joke makes sense. You don't think that stuff out consciously, you intuit it (which takes about one-millionth as long to do). This is especially true with artistic creations. You can reverse engineer them and find a philosophical outlook on reality that makes the created thing work, and it will take gigabytes to lay out what the artists' instincts told them in a split second. All we're doing here is exploring the possible bedrock foundations in ghost lore that have been assumed for this particular ghost story, a story which seems to work very, very well. And the better it works, the more certain you may be that there is a coherent universe behind it and around it.

So I thought very carefully and slowly about what wish to make, the chance of this happening again was so astronomically small that for it to even happen once, for me to know the story, to know the tree, to be alive at all, to be there at the right time. On top of a hill in Australia, one summer night, where a yogi from India had planted an ancient sacred tree many years ago.

The bosses. current strategy translates into attacks on all workers. The halving of UAW auto workers. pay has set a new lower wage standard for American industrial and manufacturing work. The increase in class sizes and tuition for students, the cuts in public services, the gutting of public health and other essential governmental services and the scapegoating of the public worker have become standard measures across the nation. The attack on the last and largest bastion of the American labor movement, the public employee sector, is an all-out class war launched by big capitalists with the intention of imposing a historic defeat on the American working class.

So, back to Mary Shaw...as a human rights activist, perhaps you'd like to condemn what happened a short while ago in the Middle East - a school was hit. A school. By the grace of God and the intelligence of the government and parents, the school was closed today - because it was in Israel and we cherish our children above all else.

I was just about to mention the Hammond organ as another highlight, with its grungey sound – particularly forthright on Newgates Knocker. But I don’t think it is a real Hammond. Holland used an old analogue Korg CX3 organ through a Leslie rotary speaker on a lot of recordings through the years, as he stated in an early ’90s interview. I’m guessing, then, that this is Korg’s ‘fake Hammond’ in action, but it sounds brilliant whatever it is.

It would be asinine to over look at the incredible advancements in technology over the past decades, from the Internet, stem cell research, to all the new apple products that have been released. But we should not fall into oblivion about the multitude of technologies that are dehumanizing the mankind. It becomes pretty disturbing reading headline all over the internet like “Why the future doesn’t need us,” “How robot drone revolutionized the face of warfare,” or “Monsanto and ArborGen set their eyes on GM trees and grass.” There are certainly millions more articles touching on these topics; these were just minuscule sample.

Oh, definitely. Writing seems to be about the only thing I know how to do from start to finish, so I’m sticking to it! I currently have another project on the drawing board. Without giving too much away, I have found that writing about medical things is quite fun. I know there are about two dozen medical shows on TV right now, and you’d think they’d run out of stories, that a guy can only break his leg in so many ways, but the truth is, the possibilities are endless. Every person’s experience is different. The great thing about medicine + fiction means my crazy imagination can create some pretty wild things as long as everything makes sense on the page.

What this study omits mentioning is that long-term sick leave has a significant voluntary component.

Trying to get her tested proved fruitless. Our district seems like a disorganized mess. I still get different answers to my questions depending on who or what office I talk to.
My favorite thing to do when I’m having major issues is to lay out in my backyard on the trampoline. Out there its just me….just me and God. Laying under the beautiful night sky that he created and watching the clouds slowing roll past the huge moon is relaxing and awe-inspiring. God took His time and He created something crazy beautiful. But to be honest most of the time that I go out there it’s because I just need to rant to God. So I’ll lay out under the star-studded sky and wait, and wait, and wait. Then, when it seems like I can’t wait any longer and my thoughts come out in a mad rush to voice themselves to God. I’ve had nights where I’ve just laid there gushing about how amazing God is because He totally did something amazing that day, or I’ll tell him how stupid I think He was. How ridiculous I felt, or hurt, or even depressed, because something He let happen or because He had done what I asked Him to the night before. I know that to my neighbors I probably sounded like a crazy person, and even though I know that God already knows everything I’m telling Him, it helps to be able to voice it anyways.

If you are a DB2 for z/OS DBA or systems programmer, chances are that a good bit of what you do is focused on improving the CPU efficiency of your organization's DB2-accessing application workload. There are various ways in which people go about reducing DB2-related CPU consumption, including SQL statement tuning, physical database design changes (e.g., adding or modifying indexes), shifting work to zIIP engines (for example, by going with native SQL procedures versus external stored procedures for data access via DDF), and exploiting new DB2 features and functions (such as hash organization of data in a table space -- a potential winner for tables for which single-row access via a unique key is the dominant data access mode). If you're doing these things, good -- keep doing them; but, let me tell you something: I've been working with DB2 on the mainframe platform since the late 1980s, and to this day I am still taken aback by the number of sites at which one of the best DB2 efficiency-boosters of all is not fully leveraged (and sometimes is hardly leveraged at all). I'm talking about z/OS system memory. You should really be looking to use this resource for all it's worth, because a) System z servers these days often are configured with LOTS of the stuff (you can get 3 terabytes on a z196), b) mainframe memory costs a lot less than it did a few years ago, c) adding memory to your system doesn't affect the cost of your System z software, and d) thoughtful memory utilization offers a variety of ways to enable DB2 to do more while consuming less in the way of processor cycles. In this, the first of a three-part entry, I'll look at maximizing the effectiveness of your DB2 buffer pools without making them larger. In part two, I'll examine the issue of configuring DB2 to use more memory for buffer pools in an unapologetic way -- meaning, when you want more memory resource for your DB2 subsystem, don't ask for it as though you're Oliver Twist ("Please, sir, I want some more"). In part three, I'll look at ways you can leverage mainframe memory for performance purposes via pools other than the buffer pools (e.g., the EDM pool, the sort pool, and the RID pool).
As you review your knowledge of nutrition you know that a variety of foods are necessary to nourish you—meats, eggs, grain foods (breads, cereals, pastas), fruits, vegetables, dairy products as well as fats, oils, and sugars in moderate amounts. You recall that no one food is more or less important than others; they are all needed and they all help one another nourish you (reread Genesis 1 as a reminder that each act of creation concludes with the statement, “And God saw that it was good”).

Anyone who fails to appreciate that interracial sex is being actively encouraged by the establishment, by politicians, by the media and by those educating our children is deluding themselves. That it is happening is undeniable and it is happening for a political purpose.
I am not sure what we should read by "nothing ruled in, nothing ruled out" but what we need to down on the ground, in workplaces, branches and regions make sure the negotiators and most importantly the employers know that are members a beneath inflation pay rise is "ruled out"; a three-year deal, when inflation and costs are still rising is "ruled out" and an attack on our terms of conditions is "ruled out"
God couldn’t tell Saul of Tarsus, in his unsaved state, how he was to be the Apostle of the Gentiles and would be committed the gospel of the grace of God. Not being spiritually minded he could not bear it. First things first; get him saved.
When he finally made the mistake of walking too close I grabbed him. He stood there with his head down pretending he wasn't standing by his old fart of a mother. Without looking at him I asked if he wanted to take the check and paper work and do it himself. He looked so relieved I almost kicked him in the butt. I rolled my eyes, handed him the crap along with my life savings (free education..HA!) and then I left.

British cultural nationalism aims to preserve and protect the culture handed down to us by our ancestors but will not rule out anyone belonging to that British culture out on the grounds of race, religion or ethnic origin.
Another disturbing trend is that there are a huge amount of focus on cosplay and otakuish trends like moe seiyuu and maid cafe. 3/4 of our guests are made up of seiyuu, cosplayer and moe related guest like Danny Choo. There are also lots of booth with moe merchandising .Sure, there are still studio booths like Production IG and such but they are just some pathetic exhibition with no host attending to it. Worse still, no attendees even go near there. I know that because my friends and I camped near there to read manga because other areas are too fucking crowded to even walk. I also pretty much stand there for hours, looking and having nostalgia trip when I watch the interesting trailers of Production IG’s work being shown. I came to know of the existence of this crazy Mamoru Oshii project called Tachiguishi Retsuden where Shouji Kawamori and Kenji Kawai starred in due to the trailers.
That's my first point. Mladic did not act alone, even if he was in charge. Why are his subordinates- the men who relayed his orders and the men who pulled the triggers- not on trial? To use that dreary Marxist term - this appears to be "tokenism".

Now that my children are school age the playdates and park days have slowed down. We don't gather in groups for support nearly as much as we used to. My children's activities and school friends have more influence on the adults that I interact with than my own choices of like minded ideals. This is both a blessing and a challenge. I have met some amazing people that are now part of my circle of friends who support me in this crazy journey. Others have been learning moments in tolerance and patience. But regardless of how well I get on with the other adults in the room there is one thing we all have in common. We are parents and we are all on a journey of the utmost importance. Raising strong, confident, capable kids who will grow up to be successful happy adults. Knowing we're not alone goes a long way towards helping us all survive the quest.

I'm grateful I kept on my happy treasure hunt. I had a hunch this precious collection would delight me with each swirl of my PG Tips and cream, lick of peanut butter in between deadlines or when excitedly delving into a new tub of yogurt and honey while I gaze into the fridge contemplating dinner. Indeed, our worldly gallivants came to an end, and we are now settled into our own cozy palace in the clouds of Portland, Oregon. But I can't shake the sparkly feeling of touching the unknown while on the road with my ritual warm brews and little bites. For a moment, I'm transported . . . We are ducking into a chai shack deep in the coconut groves, motorcycling along the highway with banh mi sandwiches tucked into pockets and sipping black Turkish tea (sugar cubes clenched in our teeth) with the fishermen on Galata Bridge in Istanbul. And in those memories, with my sweet spoons, I am home.
It was designed and built between 1787 and 1791 so there is clearly alot of history before the Berlin Wall was erected – however, this served as one of the eight crossing points along the wall from West to East Berlin and is obviously one of the most famous. You can see the ‘actors’ posing as German and Russian soldiers faintly in the lower right hand corner. They were taking pictures (just 2 euro for each click of the shutter) with tourists all around us. It was at this spot in the 60s that President John F. Kennedy visited and the Soviets (who controlled East Berlin) hung big red Soviet banners in order to prevent him from seeing into Eastern Germany. In 1987 President Reagan famously shouted, General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall! And here we were trying to soak it all in – Berlin was a wonderful historical experience.
Tars Tarkas was ten years out of captain's school, which followed a lengthy period of general schooling, and was followed by still more specialized schooling and training. He'd finished near the top of his class and was slated to captain one of the first scoutships to be commissioned. The building efforts on the scoutships were almost complete and he was anxious to penetrate the alien realms of distant stars and wrest their secrets from them for the survival of the Barsoomians. He and his wife, propulsion officer Deja (nee Thoris), were closing out their planet-based life and preparing for their Icarian adventure.
The big 'names' of the con, Jane Yolen and Tamora Pierce, could not have been any more gracious to me, a newbie to both cons and publishing. I never felt as if I was some interloper or wannabe. I was welcomed into their world as colleague and for that I am grateful.
This Japanese Fukasa from the V&A of embroidered silk and metallic flying cranes looks to be on of Dries' inspirations. The crane symbolizes longevity. This would be my "pick" from the collection.
The topping procedure mentioned above sounded a bit complicated to me and so mamma gave me an alternative. After you mix the brown sugar and cocoa powder, add a tbsp of hot water to it and mix it till you get a paste-like consistency. Into this add the boiling water slowly using the back of a spoon and mix it all in, Finally, use this mix to then pour on top of the cake batter. That way everything is evenly mixed and you have more control over how much to add in each ramekin.
In the Book of Acts, we read the amazing account of Jesus Christ appearing personally to Paul on the road to Damascus. We get an amazing insight into the importance of Paul’s writings to us “non-Jewish” or “gentile” believers as we read the account in four different chapters of Acts.

Success, like so many things in our world, is subjective. Sometimes it’s simply about not letting up, not giving in. Choosing what is positive and great, not what is easy. And I have to set myself up for success. More sleep. More laughter. More pleasure. This is not derailment. This is a path to celebration.

Of course, we were very excited for them. However, soon after we heard the news, these questions began to surface in our thoughts…“God, why did you answer their prayers, but not ours?” Do you love them more than us? Are they better Christians or better people than we are? Do these couples love you more than we do? Did they pray harder? Were our prayers inferior?” Troy and I could have chosen to stay there emotionally stuck, but we didn’t. Instead, we cut those negative thoughts off immediately and posted a “No Camping” sign in our hearts and in our minds.

Sūta politely reprimanded their disbelief by reminding them that Kṛṣṇa is Viṣṇu, not another ordinary warrior. Nothing is impossible for Viṣṇu’s magic to destroy, because by this magic the entire universe (what to speak of a comparatively miniscule explosion within it) is destroyed, and created and maintained as well.

That is why I previously mentioned, in another article, that the foundational prayer model for true discipleship is “the Lord’s Prayer” or what it really should be called, “the Disciples Prayer”. This prayer, mentioned by both Matthew and Luke, once spiritually understood, clearly lays out the Father’s plan to have us be His Partners in enforcing His Promises and His will in order to bring forth His Kingdom in this world.
That compromise appears in the way Dick spent so much time trying to explain his experiences. In this fascination with understanding and explaining the experiences, we see Dick laboring to reincorporate the religious into the literary and speculative opus through which he had achieved some success and which was deemed more appropriate than his religious sympathies. With Dick more than Jung, it is easy to see in this retreat a compromise with the unwillingness of those around him to meet him on common ground.
Breivik liked my letter. This was a message I emailed and posted on Facebook about the secret deals between PM Ted Heath and French PM Georges Pompidou to inveigle Britain into the EU.

As a Pennsylvania native, I can fondly recall little boxes of Oh Ryan's Irish Potatoes popping up in convenience stores in early March. For a long time, I just dismissed them because frankly, who wants to eat something that looks like it's covered in dirt? Then I discovered it was cinnamon and never looked back. I have fond memories of my college roommate Fisher rushing to the 7-11 near our workplace to scoop them up for us before they sold out. So good.

Now to the title of this post! I purchase a lot of fabric. I purchase a lot of fabric online. I purchase fabric from stores that have great customer service. I purchase fabric online and expect to receive it quickly. So a couple of weeks ago I purchased some fabric I desparately wanted online. I won't mention the name of the store (you know it must have been bad or I would have mentioned the name). After waiting 2 weeks, I emailed them asking about my order and if I needed to take my business elsewhere. What I had ordered was 4 pieces of fabric (each 2 yards), and 3 pieces of fabric (each 3 yards) from their clearance page. After my email I received a call the next day from them. I was expecting an apology for it taking so long. That is not what I got! The girl told me they hadn't cut my order yet because they were waiting to see if one of their customers wanted that fabric. WHAT!!! I purchased this fabric! What am I? Chopped Liver! Why are they waiting to see if someone else wants it!

In their IT manifesto, the Conservatives went so far as to promise that no new database would ever be constructed without primary legislation.

Check out the trading card below. It features former Rookie of the Year, Evan Longoria. Well, sort of. I read a propaganda article from Beckett Media yesterday basically feeding collectors the idea that MLB logos are not needed as long as there are plenty of autographs in a product.

Slowly, as the site grew in popularity and personalities (not all of whom were angels, it's true), the moderators began to tighten their fists, squashing dissent and any criticism of Robert Parker or of their heavy-handed ways. To paraphrase Princess Leia, the more you tighten your fist, the more winegeeks will slip between your fingers. And thus it came to pass. Eventually, a few split off after being run roughshod over and started up Wine Berserkers.

As mention, a handful of folks were shooting a match using the Czech ammunition, and aside from the significant low recoil there was no noticeable difference in performance that I could see. The gentleman of the group did mention that his Mosins displayed preferences, with some shooting the hollow bullets well, and others not so well. That in mind, I retired to the range one afternoon with the two types or training ammunition, and the appropriate rifles to test them. In my case, a Soviet 91/30 Ex-Sniper in 7.62x54mm, and an Ishapore Enfield 2a in 7.62x51mm.

One thing I do love in Lavinia, which is otherwise a good but unremarkable historical novel, is the relationship between Lavinia and Virgil. Only the men of Lavinia’s line see the prophesying dead at the sacred springs; what Lavinia meets there is Virgil in his death throes, long after he wrote The Aeneid. Their relationship is, quite frankly, beautiful. Virgil laments how much he got wrong about her—including her hair color—and what disservice he’s done. He tells her about Aeneas and the two talk about life, Lavinia’s fate, and other things. One of those hauntingly beautiful lines is Lavinia recalling what Virgil said to her—I shan’t spoil it. Lavinia’s awareness of her own fictionality stems from here, as she tries to reconcile the fact that she’s a character in a story with the reality of her life. There’s something meta about it, of course, but Le Guin doesn’t push this as much as I would have liked. Her fictionality gives her a thin immortality, which separates her from her dead and, unfortunately, robs the novel of a real ending—after all, if it’s the story of her life, and her life never ends, where can you really go?

Lately I've started putting our snacks in jars too. It started with the mints, because they were making the whole cupboard smell minty, and all the snacks were starting to taste minty too. Today I went through and put all the bulk snacks in jars—dried cranberries, peanuts, everything.
There was a man who sowed the seeds. He did not water or fend off crows or pave the way with plough and smashed pottery. His job was only to sow.
Robert Chambers (1831-1868), from Pottery Bank, Walker, was one of the most successful oarsmen in the 1850s and 1860s when professional rowing was Tyneside's major spectator sport. A protégé of the legendary Harry Clasper, he specialised in single sculls. His most famous feat occurred on the Tyne in 1859 when he managed to pull back his opponent's seemingly unassailable hundred-yard lead to win the race. He later went on to win the World Sculling Championship, the first Tynesider to do so. When he died of tuberculosis five years later, he was given what at that time was the most elaborate funeral ever accorded to a sportsman in the area; over fifty thousand people lined the route from Pottery Bank to Walker Cemetery.

In a discussion with his disciples, Jesus told them that his Father’s house had many mansions. When Thomas expressed his doubts Jesus replied, “No one comes to the Father except through me”. Building upon his original metaphoric description of the path to spiritual salvation Jesus deepens it, his meaning clear. His life, his state of perception, outlook and actions were to be the template for others to follow. He led by example. But the common misperception of those verses to be literal in nature sadly obscure this deeper, gnostic truth. More argumentation.
Old arson cases based on unscientific, since-discredited folklore in my opinion deserve the same kind of comprehensive review. Again, we're talking about a finite, identifiable number of cases. It would be a large job but not an insurmountable one. Researchers in other jurisdictions are already developing a screening process to vet old arson cases, so nobody would have to reinvent the wheel. The Todd Willingham case got the debate over faulty arson forensics sidetracked into a death penalty dispute, but the truth is a lot of people have been convicted because an arson "expert" told a jury things were true about fire that science has since discredited.
Once all the tufting is done, you'll just need to finish off the edges. Don't just roll the fabric back behind the pegboard and staple it down. The key to nice looking upholstery projects is all in the lines. Minimize the bumps and wrinkles! The fabric, especially along the edges should be flat and smooth. To make the edges of a headboard smooth, fold in a line going straight out from each tuft toward the perimeter. The fold takes care of all the excess fabric so that the edges can be smooth and taut and ready for you to staple down on the back side.
But, what about after death? I won’t be able to fight much then. And my YES team will either be dead, as well, or so old and feeble that they can’t make it to the morgue to oversee the proper handling of my body after death. I mean, everyone wants dignity, I think in both planes – the living and the afterlife.

Rob Parissi (lead vocals & guitar) was raised in the steel mill town of Mingo Junction, Ohio . Parissi graduated from Mingo High School in 1968. Rob formed his first band in 1970 in Steubenville, Ohio, one mile north of Mingo Junction along the Ohio River. The band's name "Wild Cherry" was taken from a box of cough drops while Rob was recouperating from a brief hospital stay. The band played the Ohio Valley region, Wheeling, West Virginia and the rest of the Northern West Virginia panhandle, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The original lineup included: Ben DiFabbio - Drums, Lead and background vocals - from Mingo Junction, Ohio, Louie Osso - Guitar, Lead and background vocals- from Steubenville, Ohio, Larry Brown - Bass, Lead and background vocals - from Weirton, West Virginia, Larry Mader - Keyboards, Lead and background vocals - from East Springfield, Ohio, and of course Rob Parissi - Lead vocals and Guitar.After the original members broke up, there were other members who also played before the big hit, such as Rob's cousin, Coogie Stoddart - guitar, Lead and background vocals and Joe Buchmelter on Bass.

I looked at him and those big wide eyes. "I would love to but… I can't." He nodded but he was quiet, downcast. "How about if I leave you a present?"
I've learned though several years of mission-going that God can work in some pretty mysterious ways. He can use a simple tract hung on a doorknob through the Holy Spirit if He so desires. He can use a plain sheet of paper that describes a local body of believers to show a fellow or brother or sister that they need to get reconnected. I've learned that God would leave the 99 sheep for the 1. And if the effort we made leads to one lost sheep returning to the fold, the whole sha-bang was worth it.
Stage three: The stock and garlic should now be reduced. Take it off the heat and whisk in the creme fraiche, and then the parmesan. The mixture gets lovely and thick. Serve the broccoli and gnocchi into bowls, and then pour the parmesan cream over the top. It is very important to eat the gnocchi with a spoon to scoop up as much of the cream as possible.

In a country where we preserve our heritage properties, cherish the old relics and heirlooms, the living heritage is being so severely neglected and abused. Economic insecurity, loss of physical ability to work and care for one’s self, falling health, physical and psychological isolation , often the social and religious taboos play havoc on these elderly people. Sometimes there is a fear of losing the spouse and low self-esteem also makes them vulnerable.
On this particular visit, I was accompanied by a friend who grew up in Bay Ridge. She told me stories of her childhood and of her vivid memories. We strolled along Shore Road, where the photos were taken. This gave me a real human connection to the neighborhood for the first time. As we left at sunset, a moon shone brightly over one of the streets. I'm sure for her, it was no less than Moonrise Over Hernandez :)

The large owl on the wall is a bread basket. I had a clock up there but my cats kept trying to nibble on the owl, so I hastily threw him up there to keep him from harm's way. And that's where he has stayed.
“There was no other solution,” La Nacion reported Videla as saying. “We were agreed that was the price to win the war against subversion and that we needed it not to be evident so that society didn’t notice.”
Way back in January, I started off the year on an ambitious note with Rainer Werner Fassbinder's epic television serial Berlin Alexanderplatz, a fifteen-hour tragedy set in pre-WWII Germany. I spread out the film's thirteen episodes and feature-length epilogue over the course of a week, and it was an exhausting but undeniably powerful experience.

One of the exhibits at the Oregon Zoo is the Backyard Makeover. There are two little demonstration “backyards” side by side. One is fairly standard: lawn with a fair-sized concrete patio, a few flowers along the fence, the fence is solid wood slats, one small tree and a birdhouse. The other has a smaller area of lawn, far more flowers & shrubs (of varying height), a couple of trees, the patio is made of stone blocks and has patio chairs on it, and the fence is slatted wood that lets a bit of light and air through but still affords privacy. The game is to find the seven things the same in the two yards, and to also notice what’s different about the yards. There is also some signage about what plants are in the yards, how the second, “improved” yard allows for more and more-varied wildlife passing through, requires less watering overall and gives reasons for using less (or no) pesticides and fertilizers. Next to these two yards is a booth where volunteers are often on hand to talk about how to reorganize your yard to bring in beneficial bugs, more birds & other wildlife, how to reduce use of pesticides & fertilizers, how to compost, how & why to set up worm bins and all that good stuff.
The infrastructure to safely remove this material was destroyed as it was at the other three reactors. Spent reactor fuel cannot be simply lifted into the air by a crane as if it were routine cargo. In order to prevent severe radiation exposures, fires and possible explosions, it must be transferred at all times in water and heavily shielded structures into dry casks. As this has never been done before, the removal of the spent fuel from the pools at the damaged Fukushima-Daiichi reactors will require a major and time-consuming re-construction effort and will be charting in unknown waters. Despite the enormous destruction caused at the Dai Ichi site, dry casks holding a smaller amount of spent fuel appear to be unscathed.

What did u discover today?
I thought, well, what if you had a situation where you could create a business instead of a charity? Where for every pair of shoes you sold you gave one away. That way, you had something you could continue and sustain. I was really into this idea of sustainability … that way when the kids’ feet grew or the shoe wore out, it would become our way to continue to give them new ones, as well as allow our customers to continue to participate in the movement. So instead of a charity, I started a business encompassing a one-for- one model where you buy a pair and we give a pair. Very simple. Totally transparent.
So, mark your calendars!!

She returned to North Dakota for a tonsillectomy, and later made her way to Chicago for a gig at The Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel East. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee, "Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into The Buttery, and she was very impressed. So the next evening she brought Benny in, because they were looking for a replacement for Helen Forrest. And although I didn't know, I was it. He was looking at me strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. I thought that he didn't like me at first, but it just was that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing." She joined his band in 1941 and stayed for two years."

“Everything,” Boggs would say, “depends on the contingent and the adventitious” -- Boggs, liking that word, drew it out -- “and if some people make some decisions that result in the physical interference of one vehicle with another in an intersection, and that can be called an accident, then what can'’t be called an accident? Where my footsteps fall, where I place my hands, where I sit, where I stand, how I appear in the world, who I speak to, the kind of work I do, who I befriend, who I fall in love with?” Boggs pouted. “Accident?”
Without a doubt, I would not be who I am or have accomplished what I have without him. Aside from my family that raised me, no single person has done more to shape me than Jim Henson.

Bang! That's the headline of this piece from The Atlantic. It sprang from the biro of Raj Patel. Dick Puddlecote's readers may recall the name.

It is here in North Idaho, a perfect place for our family. I love it here! Our new home isn't very far from the one we're renting now. It is a humble, neglected fixer-upper sitting on 10 dreamy acres of pasture, some flat, some gracefully sloping. There is a small pond, fencing, and outbuildings. Every bit of it exploding with potential.

Since I am so well nourished with juicing, I no longer desire to sit down to what used to be a normal meal for me. I may have a salad and/or a baked yam on which I drizzle some coconut oil and crushed garlic. Yum. It works for me. Seriously, I have thousands of recipes I collected over a life time and I no longer cook like that. Why should I? It is counter-productive. I was raised on dairy, bread, meat and potatoes. . . and it got me to where I was, a once healthy old woman who was beginning to have some major problems, so lets just say, I don’t eat like that any more. It took some doing, but this is working for me.
Notes: I am making the assumption that since the menu description does not mention cheese, that there will be no cheese present on the Vegetable Po’ Boy. Ask. There is also no information on the vegetarian status of the baked beans. Ask. I’m not trying to lead anyone down the path to a *gasp* non-Vegan sandwich. The information available to me, I am passing on to you. Worst possible outcome: You ask and find out the sandwich isn’t vegan, but you’ve let them know there is a demand. The word “vegan” came out of your mouth, and I think that’s a good thing.

The basic answer is that the Lord appointed Paul as the “apostle of the Gentiles.” That is seen in Romans 11:13. Then, according to Galatians 2:7, he was committed the distinctive gospel of the uncircumcision; that distinctive gospel belonging to the Gentiles. He didn’t belong in Jerusalem.

I followed a red-tailed hawk around this afternoon, trying to get the perfect photograph, but I did not succeed. The hawk was circling a fairly large valley that is a local county park, riding the thermals and gusts on an unusually hot day on the front of a storm. I couldn’t follow quickly enough on foot so I was actually driving my car and parking it, hopping out and looking at the sky for the hawk. It was always gracefully circling elsewhere, so I quit the pursuit and headed home, followed by the storm.
I'm really going to struggle this week to post everyday - and I've done so well so far! I'm packing up my whole apartment to move to WA.

Skadoosh Baltic Porter – I transferred this to my keg the other day and wow! I was blown away. The malt character in this brew is awesome and we even managed to get a sort of smokey character in there. Not sure where the smoke comes from but I’ll take it. It was room temp and un-carbonated but my initial thought was this is one of the best brews I’ve ever made. Of course I tasted this after a 6hr brew day which means I ingested plenty of brewer’s fuel (beer and whiskey) prior to tasting the Baltic. So I might have had my beer goggle goggles on. Nobody panic I think I made the perfect beer.
Nobody wants it or ever asks for it. No one ever eats it; it is the first item to be pushed to the side when eating the entree. Sometimes it is actually tasty, like 1% of junk mail that is really useful to some people.

I think the place to start with these questions is Spota’s decision to cast a work in bronze and to make that reference to Johns. As objects, these works are weak at the moment (though I am optimistic about Spota being able to take things further in the future), but the idea behind this move is fascinating. It was as if it was 1954, the Castelli Gallery, and Jasper Johns’ first show all over again, a moment where fevered dreams of belief met up with raw material and the physical status of objects, where people started to wonder what one had to do with the other. You could call it the day that art lost its innocence.
Last weekend we took the boys and Mother In Law to the Malvern Autumn Show. More of a harvest festival and country show than merely just gardening. A lovely sunny day luckily ( nothing worse than a soggy, muddy outdoor event is there?) and although we didn't buy much ( I tend not to these days - another side effect of #less365 - I can admire but don't need to own) we had a lovely wander round stalls and displays. There were animals to speak with, nice food stalls to eat from and it was one of those events that managed to appeal to everyone from a 12 year old right up to an 81year old. No mean feat that!
No sane man will dance.
In another pub, the beer was served too warm and from the condition of the beer, I got the impression that it had not been cellared long enough for the beer to settle. In context, it was the first pint of the day poured in this pub and it may have not been pulled through the line thoroughly enough. In another, it was too cold and this masked some of the more subtle flavours of the beer.
Because the event known as the Burger Bash is an annual SoBe highlight, we've got a whole burger chapter including winners of the festival's best burger awards. Another chapter is all barbecue, with recipes pulled from the super-popular SoBe event called the BubbleQ, where 25 or so top barbecue chefs man grill stations on the beach and serve up all different kinds of amazing 'cue with rivers of fancy French Champagne.

I always intended to live in or travel through Germany. My sister had moved to Germany when I was in middle school, and I started studying the language so I could write her letters in German...which I'm pretty sure never happened. But I did develop a fascination for the culture and language. And yet, my five hours in Germany, ordering sauerkraut and gluhwein, are the only workout my linguistic skills have ever gotten. (Unless you count IMing with my coworker in the Dominican Republic in German.)

One of the places in the Tenderloin that really makes my heart feel mushy is St. Boniface Church. During the day, the church opens its doors to people who simply need a safe place to be. The sound of the parishioners saying the rosary intermingles with the sound of snoring from the homeless folks asleep in the pews. Those snores are prayers, too: prayers of thanks for the sanctuary of the church, prayers of peace from those who have so little of it in their daily lives.
Downey was an Oscar nominee for his portrayal of the comedic actor Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic Chaplin, but had more recently become better known for his struggles with drug addiction. A surprise choice for Iron Man, he unveiled a newly buff physique for the role, and critics almost universally hailed his suave, charismatic performance as the film’s central triumph. Terrence Howard co-starred as Stark’s Air Force officer friend, while Gwyneth Paltrow played his adoring assistant and Jeff Bridges was his business partner, Obadiah Stane. Iron Man’s director, Jon Favreau, first made his name in Hollywood as the screenwriter and star of Swingers (1996). Favreau previously co-starred in another (less successful) comic book adaptation, 2003’s Daredevil, with Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner. As a director, he helmed the high-profile comedy Elf (2003), starring Will Ferrell, and the fantasy film Zathura (2005).

Little did we know that a riot was going on in China Town, right by the hotel. Seriously, that’s true. Apparently some Malaitan boys were annoyed that their football team lost to West Honiara by a controversial goal in the first half, and so they went on a bit of a drunken rampage, trashing cars and offices until the army (i.e. RAMSI troops) got called in. So riveting were the speeches at the hotel that we knew nothing about any of this, and we innocently drove through Chinatown about half an hour after it had finished, only to recieve a barrage of phone calls upon returning home, telling us to stay put.

Concerning Character: Courtney is set up to be the heroine who's a fish out of water in both her family and her new neighborhood, but she isn't by any means insipid—she's got sass, even a little bit of attitude, and is determined to survive. The peripheral characters, for the most part (including her parents) are a bit exaggerated for humorous purposes, but Uncle Aloysius gets fleshed out into a rather intriguing and even sympathetic character.

I feel like I'm in kind of a slump...so whether this means finding a new job or going back to school to get an alternative degree, I'd really like to figure something out. A change will do me good, right?

Today I realized half-way through my graduate seminar that a pair of underwear had gotten stuck in my jeans in the dryer and I'd been walking around all morning with a Hanky Pankian lump lodged against the back of my knee. What does it say about a person who puts on a pair of jeans, rides the subway for thirty minutes, and gives a presentation without realizing there is something of substantial size *inside* one's rather thin and stretchy pants? That there is laundry within one's laundry, sartorial mise en abîme? I dunno, but I couldn't excuse myself to the ladies room, stuff the stowaway in my pocket, and return to the discussion on French feminist theory without giggling just a little bit.

In the journal, the team reports on the burial of a man in his twenties, found with four pots, five copper ornaments in his mouth and his skull streaked with red cinnabar. Study revealed, "the skeleton was incomplete and had been disturbed prior to excavation: the left forearm and lower legs were entirely missing; and the right humerus had been put back on the wrong side. In all likelihood, these disturbances were caused by the Moche reopening the grave, and not by tomb plunderers (Huaqueros) who would have removed the grave goods to sell, and not bothered with the skeleton."

Your words create the environment in which your life is lived. They also set the limit and create the lid that determines how high you will go. They can destroy what you have spent years building as well as reveal what is really buried in your heart and mind.

and, i know you guys are going to want specific instructions on this, but i am mathematically-challenged, so i just snipped and hot-glued as i went along. it probably would've been better to measure everything out, but it would've taken me ten times longer, and i didn't care that much!

Look, sorry to get you excited, but I'm not going to rant about "white IPA." Or black IPA, or strong IPA, or session IPA, or double/triple IPA, or even this insane "zero-hop IPA" that BrewDog and Flying Dog are doing. It's coming, believe it, but not today. Today I just finished my taxes and it's gorgeous outside, so I'm having a beer.
Last weekend we went to the Tulip Festival in Mt. Vernon. It was our first time there. It was a sunny day, a rare treat, so wee took full advantage of it. The flowers were exquisite. I felt like Dorothy in her field of Poppys, only my field was Tulips. I have to thank my friend Laurie. She took time out of her Saturday to be our tour guide.
Centurion was the only screening this evening, but it was a fun gory time. I reviewed it already in case you missed that.

I receivd your favor yesterday. I am glad you have got yourself ready. If you find that you cannot easily get a pass for the Boat, I would have you get a pass for yourself and children and effects.

I was worried that the emerald green colour might be too pale to write with regularly, but it is not. It is a slightly blue-tinged green, bright but still dark enough to read clearly, even in a 0.28mm nib size. The colour is actually somewhat similar to the green ink in those old Bic 4-colour ballpoints, but not as dull. The ink really is a lovely shade, and one that should stand out from any other colours that you may be using.

Based on the British Crime Survey, domestic violence is the largest single form of crime against women in the UK. In the British Crime Survey of 2007/2008, domestic violence accounted for about one in six violent incidents, approximately 16%.
The website that drew up the diagram above gives a pretty good explanation:
Of course, tonight is also opening night for the NFL, so Obama made the lead from behind decision to move his speech to 7pm Eastern so as only to interfere with the pre-game festivities and not the game itself.
Entering a state of higher consciousness — a term used to explain experience that transcends conditioned thought — takes us into more expanded dimensions of conscious being, involving frequencies that for the most part cannot be ‘measured’, from a conventional scientific perspective. The spontaneous expression of love and kindness are examples of the transcendence of conditioned thinking and doing.

The choice to start a blog comes with a bundle of responsibilities. Ofcourse, it's a breeding ground for freedom of speech, and serves as a blank canvas upon which we leave our mark on the unexplored nether-regions of the interwebs. But a successful blog requires as much care and attention as a Yorkish Terrier. One must be consistent, thoughtful, creative and vigilant at the same time. It's rare that you find a fascinating blogger who lacks all the preceding qualities.

Now, at this stage you could either puree the Masala or leave it as it is. I love it as it is with the mushy texture of tomatoes coming up while eating, so I don’t puree this. But if you are doing it, increase the quantity of tomato in it like take 3 tomatoes instead of two. Otherwise the masala will not be enough thick after blending.

Now, if you want us to agree to your choice of restaurant with enthusiasm so we can avoid still yet another trip to Fresh Choice---and BTW---I DETEST a buffet because if I'm paying $13 a plate for something, I do not want fucking SALAD and do not want to have to clean up my own table, or worse, someone else's mess so I can sit down--then give the vegetarian fare at your favorite restaurant a try, and let us know if THAT was any good.

Until recently it was beyond dispute that the law of double patenting is concerned only with what is patented—that is, what is claimed. To determine whether there is double patenting it is the claims that are compared; thus, obviousness-type double patenting occurs when the claims of a later patent are an obvious variant of the claims of an earlier patent. The specifications of the patents are irrelevant to the double patenting analysis, other than to guide in construing the claims. A double patenting analysis occurs only when the earlier patent is not prior art against the later patent.

Though he is seldom categorized this way, I think Jim Henson ought to be considered the most successful of all New Vaudevillians. A hippie puppeteer, he was of the same generation, and shared many of the same approaches and sensibilities as The Flying Karamazov Brothers, Big Apple Circus and scores of other artists and organizations that sprang up in the late 20th century. Henson, who got his start in the mid 50s, was actually on the leading edge of that movement. He’d gotten his start on tv variety shows, including the Ed Sullivan Show. The death of that show in 1971 marked the end of the line for old-school variety (that is variety created by folks who’d experienced the real heyday of vaudeville).

A belief that terrorists are crazy or irrational may lead to an overemphasis on security to deal with the relatively small number of terrorist organizations, rather than taking a more holistic approach to the root causes of terrorism. The belief that terrorists are driven by anti-Americanism and hatred of freedom reinforces the idea that terrorism is an accumulation of the irrational or “slick” beliefs of a few, rather than the militant wing of a substantive political agenda that may receive widespread support, including financial aid. The myth that terrorists are mainly motivated by anti-Americanism ignores the violence they have done to other Muslims, and sets up Islam as the enemy rather than highlighting potential alliances with Arab leaders.

So, now that it’s time to pick some goals for the Nerd Fitness challenge, I thought, “Hey! I could go running on my off days!” (I’m an avid/reluctant crossfitter, depending on the day, on Tuesdays and Thursdays.) I’ll be having minor surgery in a few weeks and won’t be allowed to lift anything heavy (Sacre bleu!!). So running would be a good goal to add in there, right?

In the latest incident, 36-year-old Christo Jansen van Rensburg from the Heilbron area was petrol bombed and set alight by attackers on Tuesday. He survived the attack, but sustained serious burn injuries. In another attack, Dave Foxon (43) was shot in cold blood in front of his pregnant wife and two children on a holiday farm outside Hazyview.
Probably the biggest news this year is that Ren Allen, the founder of ARGH, stepped down and turned it over to Scotty and I and it is now a part of our Bowman Adventures business. This is her message to everyone:
From the colonial struggle for Africa to the present day competition for Africa’s raw materials and new markets, Africa has been a desirable prize for foreign powers. Nowadays, even the idea of ‘Africa’ is also a cause for people to enhance their careers.

Now this particular rooster didn't resemble most other run-of-the-mill, henhouse roosters around those parts, daily strutting around the yard like he owned the place ... this rooster was leaner, meaner and more athletically put together, like one of those fightin' roosters sporting an extremely proud and aggressive demeanor, yet Grandpa DooLittle had assured Uncle Virgil of the fact that "he sure ain't no fightin' rooster" ... but no mortal human being other than Uncle Virgil could get anywhere within forty feet of this pugnacious bird without chancing an immediate, wanton and severe flogging, it's razor-sharp spurs capable of slicing one to the bone, and Virgil would often feed the obstreperous fowl cracked corn right out of his bare hand treating it as if it were a pet ... unfortunately word spread about the dangerous critter that Uncle Virgil Hunnicutt had been keeping in his backyard.

I got back to my parents' house with a few coveted minutes for rest before heading over to visit Mary K. Spencer, a potter whose studio I had been wanting to tour for quite some time. I was blown away by all the production work she had, every piece made with love of course! She has been incredibly helpful and encouraging, and for that I am very grateful. She is a huge inspiration!

Mr PBBB went to Brussels yesterday. We all know what happened last time he went. Yes, that's right, Brussels had 'run out of chocolate' and he brought me back a red pointy hat with a bell on it as a present.
I woke up/got up at 9am. My mom called, then Andrea called, then I spent some time on the phone with CDC (Child Development Centers - Day Care for the Army) trying to schedule child care for Jim during my FRG (Family Readiness Group) leader training.

Then R.E.M. decided to announce they were splitting up in September, I cried for about a month, then this song was released, and damn it, if you’re gonna say goodbye to thirty plus years of music, what a way to go out. I still cry every once in a while. My entire life has been devoted to this band. They are my soundtrack. Au revoir, mon amis. You were worth the effort.
Hey Peeps! I know alot of your have been letting me know you have issues with your subscription to my blog and I appreciate that! I have done some research and it seems I let my subscription to the URL “thegrizasonline” lapse and someone in cambodia bought it out from under me. So, I have now changed the URL to “grizaland.com” and am trying to change my feedblitz settings as well.
That’s why I find it odd when I see CEOs spending so little time mentoring their employees. You may not find it in the required curriculum of a fancy MBA program but mentoring is crucial to business success.
On my last day, a man rang in with some trifling complaint about traffic. In the course of his chat, he let slip that he was a cycling postman. Cormac seized on this gem and tapped into a story about a way of life that’s now almost extinct. The man’s father had been a cycling postman and his grandfather had been a walking postman. The man painted a vivid portrait of men braving all weathers to bring people a link to the outside world. That was when I felt the true power of story: simple, beautiful, eloquent.

And what of the third, fourth and fifth parties: the Greens, Liberals and Tories? As the first graph appearing above records, of the three the Conservatives attracted the most first preferences in wards, but only (and only just) saw a single councillor elected to the five each won by the Liberals and Greens. One interesting and significant point of detail: the wards where a party sees a councillor returned do not neatly align with their best first preference performances. For example, the Greens currently have a councillor for Canal ward (on 703 first preference votes) and Southside Central (812), but not a sausage in Langside or Pollokshields, in which they polled initially much more strongly.

However, Carl Franklin has made a magical cover for “The Galloping Ghoul of Hockomock Swamp”. I think it is the best cover I’ve seen well….since…well since he did the cover for Raynia’s Magic.

The book has a blog’s timing and sense of unfolding that makes it irresistible. Immediate. As if we’re along for the ride. And yet I can hold it in my hand, underline passages, dog ear the pages, and let it drop to the floor as I finish reading for the night. I miss that about a blog.
Joy to you, Noreen & Hunter
How does honing your craft, gaining some real in cage experience and seeing how you match up with other up and comers before making your pro debut not sit well with you? Is this coming from the same guy that pays participants on his show, The Ultimate Fighter, absolutely nothing? I just don’t understand where you’re coming from. If it weren’t for the amateur end of the sport, half of these guys would never really know if they have what it takes to compete against a total stranger in front of real fans. Do you really feel that amateur promotions are taking advantage of these guys? If it weren’t for promoters stepping up and putting on amateur shows, these guys would have no place to showcase their talent.

If you ask me now what it was about her that caught my eye, I'd be hard pressed to explain. It was as if the other people were a blur and she was the only clear figure for miles around. Her picture was sharpened by the rest of them being out of focus. Her pose was almost classical. She sat slightly sideways on the bench, not really focusing on much in particular. There's a curious angle that people seem to assume when lost in themselves like this. The head slightly tilted to one side, their gaze downwards at about forty five degrees.
The best thing people like about Braeo is the fact that if you attach something to him, he gets +2/+2. Now let’s start counting shall we? Let’s say we also have Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer and that we can attach this Ongoing ability to Braeo. This means that instead of a +3/+3 he’ll turn into a +6/+6 (3 from himself, 2 from the printed powers and another 1 from the Rallying Cry). Pretty small guy, which can turn into a big guy with the correct cards, see how much fun he is?
I made this for a girl friend. (A lady at church helped me with the colors Thank goodness) I am not so good at that sort of thing. I have a frame to make one for myself I just have to get around to deciding where I want to put it and then agonize over colors again.
Mexican America is in the ring. Anarquia asks why they aren’t included in the Tag team Title match. Is it perhaps because the Guns beat them, with ease a few weeks ago?

I do not think that this leads to any need for great vagueness about what conservatism is at the political (policy-preference) level, however, so would reject the view noted by Owen Harries when he says:

That situation is exactly what I am talking about when I say I don't know anything. Being an RN as opposed to the extern or the tech is completely different. I think it was that very moment that made me realize how serious my job really is. I am responsible for people's lives. They come into the ED expecting that I can do anything they need me to do, and that is a lot of pressure!! And it's scary!!

I've been known to have a pop at people or organisations that fail my World View. Perhaps too often it might be said. Just occasionally there is a complete reversal of that irritation almost to a level that makes me feel quite humble and sorry to have ever made the fuss in the first place. Of course, I'd like to think that it was my complaint that caused an apparent change of direction, but I guess I'm probably just too insignificant to make such a claim.
There were a couple of moments where there was a flash and a smile of the real Alex tucked underneath it all. That was worth the whole meeting, just to see that small bit of her still left hiding away. Just like the title and quote. I hope she survives it all!
There are many opinions as to why electoral turnout has declined and what to do about it. Social-psychological explanations often focus on demographic trends that have introduced large numbers of young voters with weak party attachments into the electorate, whereas more contextual explanations have stressed the decay of parties and civic organizations that formerly mobilized voters through personal canvassing. If voting is primarily a matter of individuals’ enduring propensities to vote, little can be done about declining turnout rates short of changing the ways in which children are raised by their parents or socialized in schools. On the other hand, those who stress environmental factors propose to ease registration requirements or reinvigorate parties and other mobilizing organizations.
The challenge with many people is they are too lazy to pray.

Men who have grown soft with unearned privilege will probably not like Lewis in THERE WILL BE BLOOD and are probably the reason Brolin’s not even nominated.

And while Mother’s Day is celebrated ten months a year in over one hundred and twenty-three countries beginning February 8th in Norway and ending December 22nd in Indonesia; many Americans often give Mother’s Day greetings cards to recognize their mother, aunt, grandmother, nanna or step-mom. But this Mother’s Day, Canton, Michigan author B. L. Fowler has developed a remarkable Mother’s Day gift book entitled Honorary Mother’s Day Award. The seventy-six page emotional filled gift is enveloped with forty-three, soul-stirring, prose and poetic expressions that convey faith, hope, and love.

The Columbia River Gorge area runs between Interstate 84 on the Oregon side, and State Highway 14 on the Washington side. The Historic Old Scenic Highway is located just to the south of I-84. The old highway was built between 1913 and 1922 and is now a historic landmark. In 1926 the road became part of the then-new United States highway system, US Hwy 30.
I must say I learned a great deal from doing this gown. Something I hope to apply to at least two or three 1910s outfits I'll be building next year. I'm still just waiting for that perfect sari to appear for one of them!
But it was only a turd on the way to his ass;
For the present he was doing the best he could, and he was not making any sort of pretences. When his trunk was locked he kindled himself a fire, and sat down before it to think of Imogene. He began with her, but presently it seemed to be Mrs. Bowen that he was thinking of; then he knew he was dropping off to sleep by the manner in which their two ideas mixed. The fatigues and excitements of the week had been great, but he would not give way; it was too disgraceful.
If you know me, you know this could be an extensive list. So, I have a method: I'm leaving fairy tales out of this list. I also am going to take the drastic step and exclude Austen. Yes, you read that correctly: none of Jane Austen's glorious, beautiful love stories are going to be listed here. But really, think about it: we all know about the timeless romance of Elizabeth & Darcy, or Emma and Knightley -- it's safe to say they're going to be beloved. Although, as I start thinking about this listing, Darcy has some major competition.
What made me want to listen to Susan was the fact that she was genuinely excited about helping people. So I decided to come back to hear more and to have a health consultation with her.
For the prosaic, this is dumplings with red berry sauce and chocolate ice-cream.
What did you do last Easter Sunday? Me I tried to kill myself… by jumping off a cliff. Of course I survived just to have this post, haha.
This is the infamous Chevy Impala of this poem, New Red Car, this poem, Wheels and the post, Drive, He Said. She looks a bit mean in this photo with that gaping maw in the front, but she could “turn on a dime” and driving her was as smooth as paddling a canoe on a calm river.
So there you have it folks! Four fantastically artistic indie games that are both simple to play and beautiful to look at, and one intriguing childhood whimsical film that I’m exceptionally excited about. You can grab all of these for less than 10 dollars currently and you’re donations are not going to waste either. You’ll be aiding the World Land Trust, an organization that works to promote conservation of our world’s natural rain forests. So please, if you’re in a gaming mood and in a giving mood – I suggest stopping over and checking out the Humble “Botanicula” Bundle.
Sounds perfectly dreamy — until the inevitable torrential downpours. And when I notice everyone start to become radiant with dew, I think to myself: that would so not be me.
The weather is perfect and except for some rain over easter it has been magnificent for weeks. The wet season is definately over and I expect the Cape York roads to be open over the next few weeks.
Summer is just around the corner, which means the dreaded Bikini season is also upon us. Here lies the dilemma… You want to get in shape and workout but you don’t want to pay for an expensive gym membership that you might not even have time to get to enough in order to get your moneys worth.
One of the major themes of the night was the ways in which the local, neighborhood-level work by bloggers fills the vacuum left by the tendency of the city's conventional media to turn its attention to Brooklyn only when reporting car crashes, fires, and shootings (I forgot who said that -- was it Steven Johnson? -- but it was a good line), and I completely agree. I certainly rely more on a handful of blogs than anything else for my local news. The work of bloggers is even more impressive when one realizes that very few of them get paid for it, either.
It's the nicest surprise I've had in quite a while. And it makes me think about how I think about him.

In 1973, I was an English-language assistant in Solingen, in north Germany, which was in the industrial state of Nordrhein-Westfalen. That state had more places for English-language assistants than any other in Germany, and was also at that time dirty, unglamorous and polluted. Consequently, almost all of the people who ended up there - me included - had asked to be placed somewhere else.
It's ironic that my private detective heroine Jayne Keeney is a devotee of hardboiled crime because she's read a few books I haven't! Far from being based on any hardboiled character, she's more like a person I might have been had I made different life choices. That said, I think I've made better choices than Jayne--though whether we'd see eye-to-eye on that is another matter.
It is truly ridiculous that a jar full of random buttons did not include anything that matched this fabric. I pulled out a covered button kit to remedy the situation, so it is not a big deal, but I do wonder if I will ever find a use for all of those lonely buttons.

The group was formed in the 1960′s by childhood friends David St. Hubbins (Vocals, Guitar)and Nigel Tufnel (Vocals, Lead Guitar). They originally called themselves “The Originals” but later had to change their name to the “The New Originals” when it was found another band was already using the name.
We have talked about doing it since high school.

We stayed in the suite (don’t look so shocked – the hotel distinguishes itself for offering modern, comfortable, designer rooms at very reasonable prices), and enjoyed a super comfy bed, a small but perfectly formed living area and a terrace. The view from the terrace across the high-rise, low-rent apartment blocks and Ibis Hotels lining the peripherique is hardly the most inspiring – and it should be said that if you are coming to Paris for the first time or want to look out your hotel window onto a typically Parisian vista, this ain’t the place for you.
The brothers rallied around Schabir, a former financial adviser to Zuma, who was found guilty of soliciting a bribe on Zuma's behalf and went to jail.
Bezmenov also explains how the LOOK magazine article falsely claimed that the Russian people were proud of their victory in the Second World War, where in reality the Judeo-Bolshevik-Communist-Marxist government was happy that Hitler had been defeated so that they could remain in power.
Below the platoon sergeant and the four squad leaders are the fire team leaders of Alpha (A) and Bravo (B).

The shrinkage in Irish household sizes is to be expected and furthermore is in line with realities in the rest of Europe. According to Eurostat, in 2009 the average EU household size was 2.4. This hides a large variation with Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta having 2.9 and at the other end of the spectrum Germany, Denmark and Sweden with just 2.0. Eurostat reported that we had a 2.7 average size here in 2009. It seems though that the long term trend for all countries is average household size is reducing. In 1971 in the UK there were 2.9 people per household with one person households accounting for 18% of households. In 2009 that had fallen to 2.4 per household and one person households accounted for 29% of households. And as forIreland, here’s a table setting out our population, number of households, household size and % of households having a single occupant since the first census in the State in 1926.

As we all think of how grateful we are this Thanksgiving, I wanted to share that my greatest blessing is my son... I always tell him that he is the best son in the whole world because I want him to always know how much I appreciate him every day. And how grateful I am that the good Lord has blessed me with giving birth to this wonderful, loving, generous child. (He had his 21st birthday recently, so he's certainly not a child anymore -- I will do a post soon with some photos!)
The affair of my heart failure seems to be degenerating further into farce, and a dangerous farce at that, from my perspective.
The Tyne Bridge is a through arch bridge over the River Tyne linking Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead. It was designed by the engineering firm Mott, Hay and Anderson, who later designed the Forth Road Bridge, and was built by Dorman Long and Co. of Middlesbrough. At the time of its construction it was the world's longest single span bridge. The bridge was officially opened on 10 October 1928 by King George V and has since become a defining symbol of Tyneside. It currently stands as the tenth tallest structure in the city.
…..The fact that a coherent right-wing response is easily made suggests something more fundamental underlies the deniers’ position. That response was made by Tim Yeo, another Conservative MP, and chair of the energy and climate change committee. It is clear that the risks of inaction are too high, he said, and creating a low-carbon and resource efficient economy will give the UK a huge economic and competitive advantage in a world in which both temperature and population is rising. “We led the first industrial revolution and we can lead the second,” he said. At this point, climate sceptics Benny Peiser, from the Global Warming Policy Foundation, and journalist Dominic Lawson roared with laughter and almost fell off their chairs…The sceptics are a fringe within a fringe…
Funnily enough there weren’t only people on skates on the ice, but also people simply walking. It’s not like this is a short-cut to somewhere. At least I don’t think so.

Today’s advance was encouraging for several reasons. At no point did buyers relinquish control of the affairs. In the SPY, prices reversed only to the point where the market opened (and that was a pretty significant, nearly 2 point gap) and volume came in above average. Even with yesterday’s intraday reversal, I have to say that I’m encouraged with the action since testing the lows earlier this week.

Ghislaine Morgan runs a workshop in Casole d’Elsa---a beautiful, hilltop walled Tuscan town that isn’t overrun by tourists---and Sintra, Portugal. Both were wonderful musical and travel experiences. In Tuscany we gave a concert in the cathedral in Volterra, a town I first visited with Cadfael and D.H.Lawrence, which has enjoyed a pop cultural resurgence since Stephanie Meyers of the Twilight saga created a “royalty” coven, the Volturi, who live there. A German tourist came up to me in Volterra asking if I knew where “the fountain” was. I hadn’t seen the movie, so I couldn’t tell him, and then later learned it was actually filmed in Montepulciano. Sintra, Portugal, is a very magical place that I need to write about.
So I've been forcing myself to make healthy smoothies every morning again (I fell off the smoothie wagon a couple years ago). I think homemade smoothies are fast, filling, much healthier than their store-bought counterparts, & so versatile. Plus I can control the amount of sugar & such that goes in it. Here's a favorite concoction that I adapted from this recipe my sister-in-law Tamara sent my way --thanks T! (Added bonus that there's an Iowa connection, ha.)

So the beer I was going to order second was the Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout but when I went to order it the first time I was told it wasn't pouring properly as I said. Luckily, by the time I finished my second beer, they were willing to pour me a glass with the caveat that I wouldn't complain if it had some sediment in it. I knew it wouldn't bother me so I went ahead and ordered a glass.

Others are quite aware and proud enough to identify themselves with a t-shirt...

I got the battery exchanged, and headed back to the car - only to get another phone call from my daughter. Round two with the cell phone store. They were blowing her off again. I handled that, and decided I would attempt to install the battery myself. No sooner had I reached the car though, when my young man hurried back out to help me. Within 3 minutes he had it installed (this would have taken me at least 15 minutes, and likely would have soiled my clothing). He was certain that the battery wasn't the problem, however, as it was a brand new battery that they had just received. I explained to him why I was certain it was - and sure enough, the car turned right over. I thanked him profusely, and was on my way.
Years later, when our son Adam was born, my husband began speaking to him only in Arabic. So Adam has a much better understanding of Arabic than I do. And he is learning to read and write it in school, which I am thrilled about. It is not easy to learn any language when you are in your mid-50s, and certainly not a language as difficult as Arabic. I have two books to help me learn the language and lots of human helpers as well! Everyone tries to help me with new words and phrases. I try to speak it as much as I can and I ask questions about how to say things in Arabic, but it isn’t happening as quickly as I would like. If I could get to where I would understand much of what is being said around me and be able to carry on little conversations, I would be happy.
I love you so much. You have brought self-education to the masses in the same way that the printing press did back in the day, but faster for our instant-gratification culture.

You have given me more ideas than I could ever fully process, and for that, I'm grateful. You complete me.

If you have never read a book on marriage before, MacDonald’s Magnificent Marriage can get you on the right track. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with the book, but in comparison to what is available in marriage books, there’s little good about it either. Instead of MacDonald’s book, go and find a copy of one (or both) of the following two books: first, John Gottman’s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, which is the most practically useful book on marriage I’ve ever read. The other book is Mike Mason’s The Mystery of Marriage, which is the most theologically stirring and poetic meditation on marriage I’ve read.

I think about the back and forth, the fact that at different times we’ve liked each other unequally, the fact that my love for him came out of nowhere for me – something that I resisted for a long time, finally gave into, regretted, dealt with, learned lessons from, and finally just took as something that will probably always be (but doesn’t need to be acted upon). I learned so much from being with him. I learned that there is such a thing as getting too close to a friend, that cheating isn’t always linked to sex (and is arguably worse when it’s not), that you can’t necessarily decide who you fall for – but you can decide what you do about it, that you should listen to a man’s actions more than his words, that you can want something and someone so much that you lose pieces of yourself in the process, that you can want someone and something and not want it enough to fight for it, and finally that you are not meant to be with everyone you’ve loved.

When Eric came upstairs, Tara flipped out. Fearing they were in danger, Eric’s fangs popped out, which didn’t calm Tara down at all. Sookie tried to explain, but Tara wouldn’t listen. Instead she just reminded them of all the things Eric had done to hurt them, which of course Eric didn’t remember. Before running out, Tara told Sookie she was a hypocrite for preaching honesty and then lying to her about Eric living there.

As I’m putting the finishing touches on this edition of my blog, severe weather and tornadoes are slamming the Midwest again. I encourage you to go back into some of my previous blogs and read “Tornado Safety” (February 29, 2012) as well as “Using Insurance to Ensure Business Continuity” (January 31, 2012). If you are in an area that is experiencing severe weather, please pay attention to the weather reports and warnings and seek shelter if instructed to do so. And if you aren’t in one of these areas, take advantage of the quite time to make sure your preparedness kit(s) and plans are updated (see below) because you don’t know what lies ahead.

Thus far, AMD has countered GK104 with price cuts and an emphasis on board partners offering overclocked versions of the card. We expect to see both trends continue, with AMD ultimately positioning the HD 7000 family as a contender in the price/performance ring.

My base is vanilla with a layer of soft suede. The dsp is from Attic Boutique by Stampin' Up. The bottom panel is pool party with some Spice Cake dsp (retired). There is a tiny panel of Attic Boutique dsp in daffodil yellow peeking out from above my pool party seam binding bow. I've used the new framelit dies that are now available from Stampin' Up, embossing the bottom layer. I really prefer a narrower border when layering dies like this but that's the way these framelits have been made. My images and greeting are from the new set called Tea Shoppe. Around all the edges of each layer of card stock and dsp I have sponged soft suede ink using a foam blending tool and craft mat. The look I wanted was a little bit vintage but not dirty. The daffodil yellow of the bottom framelit gives the card a lift and all the colours combine so well together.

For a long time I had nothing but the anecdotal experience of very wise Mamas to back me up, and a lot of defending to do about my diet and our restrictions to family and friends. I've been told to give it up and "just wean to goat's milk" because this all must be "fake" or "too hard." But then I read Dr Jay Gordon's article analyzing dairy protein allergy in children and nurslings and I felt vindicated. More and more literature supports nursing moms who decide to eliminate dairy and other foods from their diet.
The Jesuits are making a dedicated effort in the United States to degrade the morality of the people of the country, to destroy family life, and to destroy all the traditional values that made this country the greatest nation in the world. This is being done by the abominable subjects being taught in government schools and colleges. It is being done by history courses that teach from revisionist history books containing many more lies than the truth. It is being done with pornographic sex education courses in the schools. It is being done with the destruction of religious values and the law of God, the Ten Commandments. It is being done by television programs, where entertainment is watching people break God's law. The natural result is a drastic increase in crime. Acts of the most abominable and shocking character are daily perpetrated within this country. The murder of one and a half million unborn babies in this country each year is one result of the demoralization of this nation.

If you haven't already heard about it, the story - told in black-and-white and with silent-movie subtitles - is basically A Star Is Born seguing neatly into Singin' in the Rain. The gorgeous Gallic actor Jean Dujardin channels Douglas Fairbanks as George Valentin, a swashbuckling star of the silent era in Hollywood who's at the top of his game when the talkies arrive and destroy his career. Much of the film deals with his slow descent into penury as he refuses to embrace the new sound era and clings on to the now out-dated charm of silent cinema. But before any of this happens, George bumps into young and vivacious extra Peppy Miller (played by the cute-as-a-button and, well, extremely peppy, Berenice Bejo) at a premiere, and when she later turns up on the set of his new movie, they fall in love.

Waking up isn’t all that hard. Life pretty much forces it on you when you realize the common factor in all your problems is you.

We wake up and understand our power to create our own reality. The hard part is staying awake. How do we keep from going back to sleep?

Elizabeth herself said her words firmly, sadly, softly, you get the idea. It got to the point where I almost found myself laughing, and I don't think Gregory ever intended that reaction!
Once upon a time, my mom knit a stress blanket. She called it her "stress blanket" because it didn't involve a pattern, used up lots of scraps of yarn she had laying around, and was knit at a time when my family (I was a teenager at the time) was in the process of moving from Wisconsin to Texas. I'm sure it kept her plenty warm on a cold Wisconsin evening, which probably also helped combat the stress, and it was about the ugliest thing you've ever seen.

I was in my twenties when I broke free, and leaving everything I knew brought with the fear, a fresh beginning. Refusing to go to my grave with regrets, "what ifs," or tears over the lost years, I set out to take back what was taken from me. Through trial and error and observing the masters I taught myself the craft, and gradually the gift of storytelling returned. Learning basics that many take for granted has been a journey to be sure, but on the flip side, if I ever need to make breakfast for 150 people, I've already got that covered.

In Revelation, John saw a vision of some present and/or future time, a time of climax and change, of doom and redemption. Many parts are confusing and others are just plain disturbing. So a lot of people tend to avoid Revelation. But it often seems like the few who spend much time there spend that time developing complicated mathematics and predictions, finding parallels to our current political climate, or drawing plans for new social systems. I’m sure the idea is to be prepared for the vision John saw, but too few others find much of anything truthful, or even beneficial, in these efforts. So we often skip over Revelation altogether.

The air of Gemini is always changing direction. First the winds blow one way, then another. It's a metaphor for how our mind solves a puzzle, first thinking one way and then trying a different approach. This is a restless and searching wind.
I cowered in a corner while my wife shopped among the bins. I tried to look interested when she’d occasionally show me a particularly noteworthy aggregation of wool. I’d comment that it was “nice,” observe whatever feature that seemed to set it apart — “that label has a really unique font,” was one of my best – then return to my refuge near the crullers. A sign near the back directed customers to “notions,” but the one I had in mind (leaving the store) was nowhere to be found.

The single biggest reason why TV watching no longer tops my list. Soap Operas telecast M-F at the same timeslot (and Life OK telecasts them all 7 days). This means that whatever story there may actually be buried in them is dragged out interminably. Where have all the weekly shows gone???

Besides the bizarre feeling of walking into this amazingly sterile and yet unfinished warehouse, full of helpers of which half could barely stand on two feet without a walker or some type of mechanical or other support structure due to their obesity or vast array of disabilities, the sheer size of this building was absolutely imperceptible. As I commented on the impossible depth of this particular Wall Mart store to the check-out girl on my way out, she actually noted as if it were a perfectly natural state of being that this was one of the smaller Super-Mega-Wall-Mart’s in the area! I couldn’t comprehend that statement, and so I left with the dour realization that the Made In America label was not to be found in any of these low-budget chain stores.

Jumpers centres on the plight of a professor of moral philosophy who is trying to uphold the existence of God in an atheistic university and society. His wife is a former singer who has lost the will to sing romantic songs about the Moon, since men walked on it and destroyed its mystery. The story is a simple whodunnit and the murder of one of the professor's colleagues takes place against a literal background of the moon as there is an enormous TV screen at the back of the set transmitting newsreel footage of the first British expedition to the moon and a general election; or was it a coup d' tat that has just carried the neo-Fascist, radical liberal, Jumper party to power. The British have got to the moon but one of the rockets motors failed and there is only power to bring one of them back. The astronauts are named Scott and Oats after Britain's failed South Pole explorers.

I'm a firm believer that historical fiction fans are made, not born. Ask any HF nut to list the catalyst for their obsession: the eyes light up, and out comes the confession that stumbling over their mother's Georgette Heyer collection led them to Jane Austen and an obsession with everything Regency; or that the discovery of Anya Seton's novel Katherine in seventh grade turned them into rabid readers of the Middle Ages. Historical movies and TV shows seem to be just as formative in conversion to the religion that is HF: a 70s “Six Wives of Henry VIII” BBC mini-series might seem dated and slow-paced compared to Showtime's sleek and racy “Tudor”s show with Jonathan Rhys Meyers, but it converted thousands (including my mother) into Tudorphiles, just as “Downton Abbey” is converting thousands today into Anglophiles.
Recently, I found myself craving a brown, bitter stirred cocktail. My thoughts instantly went to the Palmetto. Mind you, I wasn't looking for some extensive experiment, just a simple tasty three-ingredient cocktail. But when I opened the refrigerator, I discovered that I had run out of sweet vermouth. I was even out of Punt e Mes. This was unsettling on many levels. As I cautiously eyed the dry vermouth, I noticed inspiration hiding behind the sherry: half a bottle of Bonal. Eureka!

I was given the chance to watch the preview of AMC's newest original drama series "Rubicon" which debuts on Sunday August 1st with a special two hour premiere from 8-10 pm ET. Rubicon is a thriller for anyone who loves mystery and action shows. It is based in New York and follows an analyst who finds out no.thing is what it seems in his attempt to figure out what to do next. He is surrounded by quirky, superstitious co-works that are very intelligent. They work to solve "codes" found in places you would never expect to find a code. There are so many superstitions in this show. The one that got my attention was the one where you are not suppose to let a broom touch your foot. You will have to watch to see what is suppose to happen when you a broom touches your foot. Can't give everything away now!!
The most cited reason parents give for putting their children into beauty pageants is to boost their child’s self-esteem, as well as teach poise, public speaking skills, tact, and confidence. Another commonly thought reason is to fulfill the mothers own childhood dreams vicariously through her daughters. However, parents can also contribute to the sexualization of their daughters in very direct and concrete ways—for example, by entering their 5-year-old daughter in a beauty pageant in which she and the other contestants engage in behaviors and practices that are socially associated with sexiness: wearing heavy makeup to emphasize full lips, long eyelashes, and flushed cheeks, high heels to emulate adult women, and revealing ‘evening gowns.’

This is why a brain surgeon is paid so much more than a McDonald's employee. Is the brain surgeon a better person? Not necessarily. Is the brain surgeon, a harder worker? Probably not. Is the brain surgeon smarter? Who knows? But one thing is certain: the brain surgeon has accumulated far more specialized knowledge and specific know-how than the McDonald's employee. There are far fewer people who can do what the brain surgeon does and, as a result the brain surgeon is perceived as far more valuable to the marketplace. This is why he is paid over 10 times more than the person who flips burgers. Money simply becomes a symbol for how much value each person has added to the world at large.

2) Now for the second part. Does she really have zero brain damage? Or did something go wrong? Megan Miranda keeps us guessing until the very end. We don't know if the main character, Delaney, is all there or if she is imagining things or even making things up.

Often times, one recipe leads me to another, as was the case with Sunday and Tuesday nights' recipes. Last week over lunch, I saw a delicious recipe for Lemon-stuffed Roast Chicken on Barefoot Contessa: Back to Basics. I knew that would be how I would use up the whole chicken. I also knew from experience there would be leftovers and thought chicken enchiladas might be a good way to use up the chicken and corn tortillas. After comparing recipes in several cookbooks, I found a recipe that required minimal additional ingredients and looked tasty. Enter Chicken Enchiladas with Pumpkin Sauce courtesy of Martha Stewart's Kitchen's Food Everyday Cookbook. Once I find a recipe and add it to the menu, I use the other side of the paper (waste not, want not) for my shopping list. I continue with my researching until all the days are filled, trying to reuse ingredients and leftovers in whatever way I can. If I am going to make a substitution, for example using red onions and garlic instead of shallots or macaroni instead of cavatappi, I also note this next to the recipe along with the cookbook source and page number. That way I'm not looking in indexes trying to find recipes when it comes time to cook!

Transform standard strength training into a super-duper sculpting session as easily as Wonder Woman slinks into her shiny one-piece: While doing any move in which you grip a bar or both feet touch the ground, imagine trying to fold the bar or floor in on itself. Without actually moving your hands or feet, engage the muscles you would need to bring your hands or your feet together as if you were infused with extraordinary power and could, in fact, crumple the objects. You will feel the extra contraction from trying to exert force on the bar or floor. During your next session, exert the same type of force, but in the opposite way: Instead of trying to make hands and feet meet, pretend you’re trying to stretch the bar or floor like taffy. "The exercise looks the same, but adding these forces will work additional, new muscles in your arms or legs," says James Bowman, co-owner of Next Step Conditioning Systems on Bainbridge Island, Washington.
The larger point for Ellen and Reid is that we have something worth caring for. That Diet Coke bottles, Bud Lite cans, 5 Hour Energy and Gatorade G2 bottles and Burger King or McDonald’s wrappers – plus other vile pieces of unimaginable trash – can be discarded without a second thought makes some dolt’s problem my problem.

Originally the home of Edmund Sherman, it was bequeathed on his death in 1600 to the Free Grammar School of Queen Elizabeth to provide a home for a schoolmaster, and was extensively remodelled in the 1730s by Nicholas Freeman. Shermans sits between the Sun Inn, a mustard yellow 14th century building with later semi-hexagonal bay windows, and Ivy House, a well proportioned 18th century red brick house with central Doric-columned front door. On the corner of Mill Street, the Essex Rose Café, 15th century, timber framed and partly pink-rendered, also housing the Co-op – how many other rural communities can boast a village shop housed in such an historic building?

One of the places I think this small little word has a major impact is in the Bible. And yet, we read over it all the time. We like the first part of a verse and so we treat the word ‘if’ more like a period. Sometimes it’s not the ‘if’ that is the period, but the ‘then’ part of the if statement. It really can have a major impact on how we live and how we live out what our Bibles tell us to do.
In my last post I told a little porky. Lots of you have guessed at it, and some of you got it right, but first I have to say, I love rabbit - Margo makes a spectacularly tasty rabbit pie. In fact game is really quite popular around here. Many restaurants will serve dishes with rabbit, pheasant or venison, and you'll even occasionally find such things as pidgoen. All worth a try, and all really tasty (unless, of course, you're a vegetarian).

But you see, when Bob Cacchione founded the IHSA in 1967, it was with the idea that anyone who wanted to compete in intercollegiate horse shows should be able to do so regardless of their previous experience and at a reasonable price. In the over 40 years since, the mission of the organization hasn’t changed and each fall, newly minted beginner riders are introduced to the world of horse showing through the IHSA. So whether or not riding in walk-trot at the end of the show day is backwards is irrelevant; instead that particular show format is in perfect line with the fundamental tenet of the organization.

Nearing the end of my sophomore year of high school, colleges have started to become more important. This verse can heavily apply to people my age who are deciding on where to go to college. Nowadays, the choice of college often determines what career you will go into due to all of the specialized colleges out there. This is also a point where the voice of God is most needed. Grades and the like will determine what doors are closed and which are open, but the door that will always stay open cannot be shut by anyone. If God intends for you to go to a prestigious college, he will clear the way for you to go to that certain college. On the flip side, if he wants you to go to a community college, he will shut doors for more advanced colleges so that you can go to that college.

This wine is not from the estate, but a blend of youngish organic vines on a vineyard that David owns himself and some choice fruit from a similarly enthusiastic neighbour. The wine is unoaked, but was fermented and matured in egg-shaped cement vats. I have been fascinated by these vessels ever since seeing them in Napa, where Spottswoode and Domaine Carneros use them amongst others, and have found it extraordinary that because a tank is egg-shaped then the wines made in it should be smooth, but that does seem to be the case. As long as everything else is done right I suppose it means that nothing gets stuck in a corner and that whatever happens to the wine is uniform. Intriguingly these eggs were first created in the Rhône and were a deliberate attempt to echo Roman amphorae in a modern way.
Allyson Felix has proven that she can double effectively over the season. So I'm betting that she attempts the double in Daegu and medals in both. I'm also betting that Sanya Richards and Terrence Trammell come back healthy and that both Bernard Lagat and Dwight Phillips keep defying age.
During Santorum’s incomprehensible rant about Obama’s handling of the Afghanistan War, he made the comment that it was difficult because we were fighting against a “guerrilla insurgent force”. I think it’s ironic that someone trying to become a the leader of a nation that is an occupying force in another nation has the gall to call people that are fighting for their freedom and independence a “guerilla insurgent force”. I would say the United States is the insurgent force. And while the Taliban doesn’t seem to be a great alternative, and certainly the United States as a global power is trying to limit the influence and growth of international terrorism, Afghanistan is not our country. If Afghanistan doesn’t want us there, and they don’t want to move toward the type of government that we want them to be (puppet Democracy), then I say we let them go the way they want to go.
Ever since I’ve been a little boy I’ve always wondered what would happen when I died. It might be a little morbid, but I can remember in primary school ‘If I die, it’s like going to sleep but never waking up.’ And as hard as I tried to imagine that, it simply didn’t make sense. I couldn’t accept that it just ‘ended’ like that. Surely, I thought, there had to be something more.

Miles 16-20: At Mile 16, I tripped over some really uneven cobblestone and came so close to face planting, I thought it was over. Some guy had stopped and pulled me up and dusted me off and I stepped off the course to collect myself before taking off again but I started slowing down...a lot. It was so unbelievably hot. At Mile 18, I refilled my water bottle again and dropped in a Nuun tablet. I started feeling it kick in at Mile 20 which I hit in 3:02...two minutes off pace but still well on pace for running sub-4.

St Augustine - Confessions 9.12:
In a face-to-face meeting we get the chance to read the body language of our colleagues and clients; their body, tone of voice and facial expressions often communicate so much more than just words. Studies show that only a small percent of our communication involves actual words: 7%. In fact, 55% of our communication is visual (body language and facial expressions) and 38% is vocal (pitch, speed, volume, and tone of voice). Therefore the face-to-face interaction is much more effective.
The Pittsburgh Penguins were the favorites in the sports world in going all the way into winning the Stanley Cup. As it was, we had been down players for almost the entire season.

Take the Italian Stallion Marella (I would use my nickname for him but ethnic slurs are discouraged). Aside from being his fourth title reign, Santino’s character is supposed to be Italian, as stereotypical as you can make him without giving him overalls and incompetent royalty. I say that Marella’s holding the title was significant because he, along with Sheamus and Kingston, are among some non-Americans who have held the title as of late. Does this mean anything for the belt? Not unless you fear communism.

But last week, Eli, buddy, those two picks were disgusting and all on you dude. We can not afford to turn over the ball like we did the last time we played the Eagles in Philly. The turn-overs in that game had more to do with Ahmad Bradshaw's fumbles, but that seems to have been corrected for the moment. Eli's picks however, continue to pile-up and it's something Eli has to control this Sunday. Turn-overs were the single biggest reason for that loss to Philly in Week 11.

Other victims project the blame back unto themselves. They accept the psychopath’s projection of blame and begin questioning themselves: what did I do wrong, to drive him away? What was lacking in me that he was so negative or unhappy in the relationship? Was I not smart enough, virtuous enough, hard-working enough, beautiful enough, sexy enough, attentive enough, submissive enough etc.
I am of the opinion that you can always learn about writing from television, and Project Runway is no exception. The reason I bring up Elisa is that what I learned about writing a few episodes ago, I learned from her. And this...garment:
Can I take food out of the beaks of baby birds? Can I heck.
Despite this superficial simplicity, in practice its use can be very complex, many jurisdictions have rules defining what counts as allowable gross floor area (for example service and maintenance areas and areas with low eaves heights, on basements and semi-basements), as well as rules as to what counts as permissible area of the plot, for example whether to count parking areas or not. In the USA for example it is common for plans to be accompanied by a certification that the calculations have been done in accordance with the zoning ordinance and staff time amongst planners is very largely devoted to meticulous checking of these calculations.
The last two years of her life were the most difficult. She was bedridden after small successive strokes; she could not speak but she was still cognisant. Every night she would wait for me to sit by her to tell her of my day’s activities and to read her favourite poems. Then she would sleep.
Speaking of high prices, my eyes finally adjust to the light enough that I can see the menu. Most items are followed by a single two-digit number, no decimals — always a bad sign. You obviously have to get the crepes at a place called Crepe Cellar, so we agree to order several different items and split them. Beth has the Spinach and Wild Mushroom Caramelized Shallots and Goat Cheese crepe while I ask for the Pesto Brie Hand Cut Pommes Frites, also known as French fries. These are priced at “6.5,” so I mentally scramble through my wallet looking for leftover euros. Hopefully, they take the exotic-sounding ”Visa.”

Everyone knows the key to lipstick looking lickable is a super smooth lip base; nobody likes flaky lips. As an avid collector of lipsticks (37 and counting) I’ve been a great believer in the age old ritual of tooth-brush buffing and Nivea coating, that is until I was persuaded to try something different and altogether more scrummy.
So after we agreed that it was my night, she sat up and put her back against the headboard. She then parted her legs widely and we piled several large pillows between her legs and down by her feet. I then lay down between her legs with my head between her feet and my legs parted and my feet resting on the top of the headboard so my open crotch was just in front of hers but level with her pubic bone and tilted up slightly. It was very arousing for me due in part to the very exhibitionist nature of the position as I said. She had great accessibility and a perfect view of my cock, ,“undercarriage” and asshole.

We managed to work around the situation's constraints fairly effectively. My roommate, Michael, went and registered in my name. No one asked him to confirm his identity, so that went fine. I avoided activities that required a student ID. I made sure to do all my word processing and printing at home. Luckily, none of my professors asked questions. A test in the testing center was coming around the end of the first month, though, and I couldn't think of any way around that.

She took a deep breath and pulled the 25 envelopes from her plaid book bag. Each envelope had a name written on the outside but inside each had its own special message. Gladys had gone through the whole bag of candy hearts and picked one for each of her fellow students. Then she had taken just a dab of Elmer’s glue and stuck it to the card. It was genius! She didn’t have to write anything on the little valentine because the candy heart people had done it for her. She walked from desk to desk slipping her envelopes in the little slot cut on the top of each box.

A few months ago, I tasted one of the best vodka gimlet’s mixed when I was treated to drinks at The Majestic. It tasted like cool key lime pie. The secret: powdered sugar, not simple syrup. When I made this lemon lime cake not too long after, my thoughts immediately went back to the vodka gimlet. Many desserts are infused with liqueurs and I wanted to recreate this drink in a cake.
Symptoms: My belly has started to protrude. Its scaring me considering I'm only 8ish weeks. Literally there is a belly. and my boobs hurt worse than they ever did when I had a child latched on day and night. Seriously I am in pain people. Oh and did I mention I'm sick and puke a lot.
And this being my daughter's favorite dessert (there are very few), Momma always thinks of her when making this cake. My little girl is now a mother and grandmother!

I already mentioned the involvement of Borgnine, Meredith, Cortese, Buttons and Morita, but would you be at all surprised to find out we also will see such familiar faces as Alex Karras, Veronica Hamel, John Considine, Edward Albert (no, not the star of "Green Acres"... the younger guy), Barbara Carrera and Lonny Chapman? Not that their appearances amount to anything more than other entries in the "Spot The Star" sweepstakes these Irwin Allen joints specialize in, however - because it never seems to make much difference what an actor says when everyone else is just going through the motions.
And finally, just because I really like it: The Blind Boys of Alabama sing Amazing Grace, to the tune of Rising Sun.

A simple look, a gesture, a smile, an eye contact, his askance to lead, her acceptance to be led, all done without any need of verbal communication. As the music compels them, she comes close to him, they embrace… they feel each other breathe, they feel the passionate song unfold, it flows through their bodies, invigorating them, stirring emotions, which they both share… they can be strangers in real life, but as long as they are in this tango moment, they can be anyone they want… You don't have to know the person or even want to know them. Time ceases to exist during this moment, both dancers are moving to the music, listening for it to tell them what to do… they slow down, pause, accelerate, suspend, all in the moment… almost as being possessed by the music. Outside of this moment is the real world, with its everyday problems, solutions, responsibilities, deadlines… but not here, not now… Now it is only tango, a refuge, a moment of surreal experience of desire, longing… words are not meant to describe it.
It's been more than a little while since I've updated the blog. Anyone still listening?

So this will probably be really sappy, but I was listening to “100o years” by Christina Perri this week. I know it’s on the Twilight soundtrack, whether or not it was written specifically for it or not, but it got me all weepy and lovey all at once and I keep waiting for the radio to play it again (I’m definitely not a Twilight fan, but I admit that Vampire Diaries is a guilty pleasure). As it’s playing I’m looking at my daughter thinking, “okay, so maybe I haven’t been waiting 1000 years for you, but I know I waited a long time for you, and now you’re here!” I know in my heart that she was loved before I even knew I was going to have a daughter. Before we struggled to get pregnant with our son, and then “oops” right away with our daughter. She was and is loved. Her fuzzy blond hair makes me smile, and I love her many faces. It’s a trait both her and brother have inherited, a million faces to show everything they are feeling.

Wow. I know there's been decades of inflation, but I'm still amazed at these prices - especially considering the state-of-the-art nature of this much heralded stadium. You could never afford to pay A-Rod $185,000 per game with those kind of prices.
Then, before the chocolate hardened, I topped each one with the other half of the golf ball from step one. This way, the new chocolate would harden with the other half attached to it, to form a complete golf ball.

I finally got around to reading the God Delusion last week. Though I am in agreement with 99% of Dawkins' views on the subject of God, I do have to say that the book was a little weak in some areas. As a person who spent most of her life around academic debate, I just couldn't help wondering why Dawkins would jump straight into the "does God exist" fray without doing a better job of defining the terms of the proposition. "Existence" and "God" are never well-defined, and as a result, he never really scores a knockout punch on ol' SkyDaddy. On the other hand, I love "The Mother Of All Burkas" at the end, where he vividly describes how very little of the world we actually see. I'm not sure this really extends his argument, but it sure is a great wakeup call nonetheless.

The moment I walked through the store, I instantly heard the sound of angels followed by a blinding light coming down from the heavens and shining on "IT" in all it's 1920ish glory. Beautiful beyond words, delicate in appearance, the black and lace frock with a kick out at the bottom portrayed the look of a bygone era. With my size in hand, I ventured into the change room and tried it on! And wouldn't you know it, the bloody thing fit!!! I stood and viewed myself with a tiny bit of admiration until I moved in the mirror. What was that I thought... It couldn't be? It can't be? Oh my lord it is!!!! The only thing holding me and this beautiful frock from creating a binding love affair was the nasty betrayal of my jelly belly that was wiggling to and fro with every movement. And just as I was about to declare defeat and send it back to it's place on display, words of wisdom were shouted from the great beyond, better known as my mother: GET A GIRDLE FOR GAWD SAKES!!!!

I never leased a horse while we were here before, but it seemed like a good plan. A year passed and I contacted the trainer again and then Max's owner phoned me in September.

In an email last week Rick Santorum sent out a letter explaining the reasons why he has endorsed Mitt Romney for President.
In addition, the judge held that Umbro succeeded on its counterclaim that much of the clothing marketed by Hudson was in fact on-field wear and thus not within the terms of Hudson's licence. The performance characteristics of these goods were not as high as might be expected for on-field wear, but the visual features of their design meant that they could not be properly distinguished from on-field wear. In addition, they were marketed in a manner that would appeal to players rather than merely to fans.
Well, speaking of my baby being sick, I can hear him crying as he just woke up from his nap, so I will have to go now. Let me know how you’re doing with your cleaning and organizing! I hope you have a good week!
Don't you just feel the sibling love oozing from every pore of those words? Since that time we've had several "Abigail took it from me!" / "No, I didn't! She put it down!" scenes.
While we're on this topic, let me add that I believe the single worst thing to have happened during this commotion, and amounting to one of the worst things he's done, has been President Obama's insertion of his opinion into the matter. He clearly showed his bias, moreover when he was not even close to possession of the facts in the case, and stirred up an issue that can and may still lead to race riots. His statement was grossly irresponsible
On a different note: it's rather unnerving to be closely inspecting the wiring in an electrical box and have a big, black, hairy spider jump out at you. EEEK! I screeched loud enough to be heard at the neighbors, I think! Ugh! Those nasty things are everywhere this time of year. I seriously am on constant vigil - well, almost constant. Obviously, I had let my guard down for a second. I so was not expecting one to be in an electrical outlet box!
It's all making me crazy. Last night, after reading a story about how Arizona has proposed a law that would allow employers to fire women for taking birth control, I lost it. I ended up in the dark kitchen sobbing in front of the sink. I don't really know what cracked, but I have felt so much lately like some kind of crazy person and a second-class citizen. I know work will be fine, that my parents problems aren't my problems and that having them stay with me isn't the worst thing ever, and that these new proposed laws are probably just the death throes of a party who has completely lost touch with the normal, average American, but it just feels like too much to take in, and I'm struggling with which me I want to be in response: raging? or quiet?

Skinner’s house is a classic center hall Colonial, built around 1720 in a coastal New England village. She and her husband – who is an expert builder and finish carpenter, saints be praised – have worked on restoring the house from its sad-sack tumbledown state to its present condition over the last 15 years. As anyone who has taken on the massive renovation of a historic house will tell you, such a project needs to be a labor of love. Otherwise you would be wiser to spend a few weeks with a sledgehammer and a couple of dumpsters, gut the thing, build out the interior with a whole bunch of 2 x 4s and sheet rock (don’t forget the 20-foot square spa bathroom!) and just call it a day. Oh, and then you can take the thousands of dollars and countless weekends you saved yourself and go to St. Barths, preferably during a long New England winter.

His writing was mostly for his own edification for a while, but then when he moved to Pueblo, Colorado eight years ago he started writing a column for the local paper. That was the real beginning, and the rest is…well, you know. I am still a loving and appreciative audience, but I’ve been joined by countless others who now enjoy his wit, intelligence, and smart-assed writing style. I have more of a vested interest than most of his readers, though. As my only son, he may be called upon to support me one of these days, and I’d prefer something more than a grandma-in-the-attic kind of lifestyle. Write on, Christian!

The key to making photo sharing work is to use an agnostic service. You DO NOT WANT to be emailing photos from the phone and you don’t want a service that is locked to a specific smart phone platform. You want the phone to automatically upload photos only once in the background during the work day. Then you can send links to those photos to recipients as needed. Managing photos all in email is painfully slow, and will quickly kill a phone battery as a complete copy of each photo is sent as an attachment to each recipient directly from the phone. Email also makes for a horrible photo collection system. Don’t force that on anyone.

Also noteworthy is that the RealtyTrac report revealed that Nevada relinquished its title as Top Foreclosure State after 62 consecutive top-ranking months.

Shinobu means to persevere or endure - the original name for ninjutsu is the techniques of perseverence. Oshi means pressure. Together, the phrase would mean something like "to endure under pressure". The contraction of these two terms becomes Osu, or Os as it is pronounced. The way that my Sensei described it, it has a deeper meaning than to continue despite hardship.

What an exciting novel! This is the story of William Tyndale. The focus is on Sarah Poyntz, daughter of Thomas Poyntz and niece of Sir John Walsh. Ann Boleyn (Henry VIII’s second wife) figures prominently in this story, as does Henry VIII. Though Sarah’s role in the story is imagined, much of the storyline is true to the real story of Tyndale’s life. What an exciting way for a child to be plunged into the life of Tyndale, and to begin to understand the struggle that took place to publish a Bible in English. Tyndale is ultimately martyred, yet his work is eventually published and distributed legally in England.

Ok, so, in my last post I mentioned about wearing a heart monitor. Here's the story with that. When I was in high school, I started experiencing funny sensations with my heart. I was checked for mitro-valve prolapse and was told I did not have it. Over the years I have had several ultrasounds and EKG's but nothing became of them. During these weird flutters , they have often times taken my breath away, made me cough and most recently, made me feel like I was going to pass out. The best way I can explain what it feels like is that my heart feels like it is jumpstarting and I feel them at anytime during the day. When the "pass out feeling" happened, my mom said....You're going to see a cardiologists. Ummm, yes ma'am! I made the appointment and again, an EKG was performed. It was normal. Blood pressure was normal etc. I told the Dr. what I had been experiencing and she suggested I wear a Holter monitor for a month. Yep, a month!

The third aspect of the scheduling is the actual daily schedule. We have this schedule for our school days:
After that I do plan to take a break from writing until December, when I plan to edit the novel. What I’ve written for NaNoWriMo is a first draft. And it isn’t pretty by any means. But that’s what Nano is supposed to be, an amazing experience, and I’ve definitely felt that.
A week later with the account open and activated I take a deep breath and embark on the first withdrawal. I am the only customer in the bank and my shoes click loudly as I cross the polished floor. The lady at the enquiries desk is applying her make up and doesn't stop as I stand in front of her. She won't tell me if my expected transfer has arrived. She says I have to fill in a slip before she can tap the number into the computer. She doesn't have any slips, I've got to get them from a man sitting at a desk back at the entry door. I walk back across the banking hall, the man is busy chatting and laughing to someone on the phone. He ignores me until he is finished. I fill in the slip back at the enquiries desk while the lady carries on with her face decorating, mirror in hand, lips pouted.
"Ersatz GB" is, in a way, The Fall's heavy metal album, proving that there is still room for surprises in the unique Fall sound blueprint. "Greenway" (adopted by a recording of Greek joke-metal band Anorimoi) starts with a behemoth of a guitar riff and introduces Mark’s death metal voice, while the slow and heavy "Monocard" steals a page or two from Black Sabbath’s book of doom. The unusual folk of "Happi Song", written and sang by Elena Poulou, throws another curveball by not sounding like a Fall song at all. Elsewhere, it is business as usual for Mark and his troops (David Spurr, Pete Greenway and Keiron Melling complete the rest of the lineup which amazingly remains stable for a third LP), with propulsive tracks like "Cosmos 7", "Nate Will Not Return" or "Age Of Chang" delivering the rough edged, raw and aggressive sound that the Fall faithful have come to expect from the band and the reason we’re keep coming back for more for as long as Smith sees fit to stubbornly keep going at it.
I think NFL commissioner Roger Goodell should grant a violence waiver for Sanu as he should be allowed to pummel the prankster that spread so much misery on the first day of the NFL draft.

The slaves then, “the oppressed, down-trodden and overpowered…” can say to themselves “let us be good… good is everyone who does not oppress, who hurts no one, who does not attack, … (who) demands… little from life; like ourselves the patient, the meek, the just.” Nietzsche’s problem with this is that the weak could not do any of these things anyway. If it is not in my power to oppress, hurt others, or attack; if I am too weak or inferior for these acts, then I am casting myself as good for not doing what I couldn’t do anyway. Nietzsche accuses the weak of deceiving themselves by making these weak behaviours (meekness, patience, passivity) into virtues, as if the weak had voluntarily chosen to be weak, had decided to embrace weakness as a meritorious act.
It is 1808; a sadistic vampire stalks a priest and attacks him. Lying on the ground, the priest prays for the monster’s soul. Enraged, the vampire does the unspeakable, dropping his tainted blood into the mouth of the priest, turning him into a vampire. The priest keeps journals, from that point on, detailing his emotional struggle with what he has become.

Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of the death of Osama bin Laden – a milestone accomplishment for President Barack Obama who ordered a top-secret Navy SEALs raid of the Al Qaeda leader’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Here’s POLITICO’s look back at what political figures have said about the killing of the mastermind of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks that shocked the nation more than a decade ago:
As the international community considers its next steps in supporting Haiti, or in responding to other disasters, I hope that the transition from the “search, rescue, shelter and feed” phase to one focused on strengthening local institutions will be faster. Defaulting to doing business with “Beltway bandits” must stop. Organizations like Zanmi Lasante and Fonkoze, which have “sandals on the ground” long before a disaster strikes, can be powerful and cost-effective engines of reconstruction and innovation.

State police in St. Lawrence County say the shooting occurred around 5 p.m. Sunday in the rural town of Stockholm when 25-year-old Shawn Mossow of neighboring Norfolk relented to his friend's repeated requests and shot him once in the right leg with a .22-caliber rifle.
I want to tell you something: Old energy dies kicking and screaming. Old energy does not surrender, ever. Old energy simply dies hard and slow. There will be hold-outs for a long time. There will be those who are convinced that the only way to get what they want is to create drama, war, and fear. They continue to want to spring up in places you felt were safe, and to pull you backwards with them. They hate the fact that the earth is going soft on them, and they continue to rattle their sabers, make threats, and make news doing it. They’re not the majority, Human Being, but often they are the loudest. When you walk around in perfect health and you are feeling great except for your sore toe, what do you think about? Your SORE TOE! So then you watch your media talk about sore toes for endless hours, and you get depressed. I know you understand the metaphor.
It was time to halt the madness. I resolved to clear one piece of clutter a day. I knew that if I made grand plans, I would fail. I am not a grand plan kind of gal. I take things step by step and see what happens. My anal side does require that I have a plan, but I fly by the seat of my pants to achieve it. I did the same with my clutter. One day's clutter might simply be dealing with the mail as soon as I received it. Toss the junk; file the bills and important stuff. Easy, right? I could do that. The next day, I would have more time and decide that everything from the deep, dark recesses of the front closet had to come out and be sorted. Of course, piling it all on the sofa required that I have my task complete by the time Hubby returned home, or we would have no where to lounge in the evening.
