Craig and hitting coach Mark McGwire have been in contact about how Craig feels about his timing at the plate. Matheny said he's been looking forward to the chance to find a spot in the lineup for Craig.

Lady Gaga — whose endless touring brings her to Atlantic City and New York this month, and to Newark in April — already has made an attempt to manage expectations, telling Vogue magazine that she wrote the song in 10 minutes; a 10-minute composition is meant to be casual, tossed off, playful, derivative.

There's no alcohol served between 2 and 6 a.m., but that hasn't stopped throngs from hanging out all night, as masses of people mostly in their 20s have adopted the club's downstairs room as their domain. Walking in feels like entering the final frontier of weekend partying: hundreds of people dancing on the old tile floors and stuck to the tired wood walls, washed by a blur of classic disco light show and pounding house music. Here, the up-all-nighters power one of the more raging dance parties in this corner of town.
To many of those voters, though, the cover is proof that even the New Yorker "gets it." And unlike just about any other New Yorker cover in recent history, they will actually see this one because it has been plastered all over the Web, cable news shows and in many of their hometown newspapers. I live in Ohio, but the New Yorker has been part of my life since I was 17, when I found a copy in our doctor's waiting room. I was a factory worker's kid who quickly fell in love with the magazine that proved, week after week, that there really are two Americas: New York, and everyone else.

If you look at the numbers, about 53% of people under the age of 25 with college degrees are either jobless or underemployed. And so there is a battle going on to see who can get them and to see if they can get them to turn out.
You swing wide on the turns, which is disorienting, but those dips are what got to me. They will, as my dad says, jerk a knot in your tail. There are extreme herky-jerky moments over the 1,000 feet of Rattlesnake, but it last only 60 seconds or so.

The Japanese delicacy "fugu" -- otherwise known as blowfish -- must be properly filleted by trained chefs because of the highly concentrated poison in its tissue. (The additional training, and chef licensing, partly explains why Tokyo restaurants charge the equivalent of $120 or more for the dish.) But the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, apparently concerned about restaurant competition, announced recently that it will soon no longer require formal training of fugu chefs, leaving it to individual restaurants to set their own standards. Said one 30-year veteran chef, "We licensed chefs feel this way of thinking is a bit strange."

That difference was found to fall short of statistical significance — it could have been the result of chance. But the difference became stronger — and statistically significant — when the researchers averaged stock prices over a crucial 60-day period that preceded the announcement of findings (a period during which speculation would likely be most intense).

The Roadblock is a “traditional bottle dance.” Lovely dancing girls are twirling and stepping and swan posing with wine bottles balanced on their heads.

After the Lakers game, during which he had 28 points and 10 rebounds, Aldridge is averaging 23.2 points and 7.8 rebounds. Last season, he averaged a career-high 8.8 rebounds. If there is an area to nit-pick on Aldridge’s game, it’s that at 6-foot-11, he could get more rebounds. Aldridge knows McMillan’s incentive is a formidable task.
A former professor at New York University’s film school is claiming he got canned in part because he gave the multi-tasking James Franco a D for skipping most of his classes, the New York Post reports. He also alleges that other professors gave Franco high marks, even though the actor failed to attend mandatory classes during the 2010-2011 school year.
What I like about tablets is that you can have the best of print and online. The tablet apps I've seen tend to be edited and organized so that it's easy to see the difference between the news of the moment vs. the day's top story or deepest investigative report. It's great for visual journalism as well; rather than one photo, you can view an entire gallery or video.

If you have an indie rock band and your name isn’t already “Cobra Triangle,” consider this a freebie. This game was the first NES game we remember that was simply impossible.

One of the first isometric shooters, this game was something that only could’ve existed in the late 80s. Speedboats were all the rage back then. You never really hear about speedboats anymore, do you?

The starting point of "Ballets Russes" was a reunion, five years ago in New Orleans, of Ballets Russes dancers, many of whom hadn't seen one another for 40 years. Then one thing followed another -- on-camera interviews with the participants, including some of the most vital septuagenarians, octogenarians and nonagenarians you've ever seen; a search for archival materials, including rare films of these great dancers in action from the 1920s on; two years of writing and editing and, voilà, a feature-length documentary, by Dayna Goldfine and Dan Geller, of absolutely breathtaking sweep and joyous energy.

* Pujols seems to be awfully anxious to end his home-run drought. He's been pull-crazy so far, yanking way to many batted balls to the left side. According to STATS, 41 percent of Pujols' batted balls have been grounders to the left side. This year 27 percent of Pujols' batted balls have been hit in the air to left field. So if you add it up, 68 percent of his batted balls have been pulled to left. Last season 40 percent of Pujols' batted balls were pulled to left. Big difference. Pujols has always been at his best when he's shooting hard-hit balls to all parts of the field, especially the middle.

The initiative also would set up a new state authority to oversee the spending of this money -- which would be dedicated for alternative fuels no matter what other pressing priorities or long-term needs exist in this state.

RAVENS PASS OFFENSE VS. RAMS PASS DEFENSE: All eyes will be on Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, who is coming off one of his worst games as a pro. Flacco never looked comfortable against the Titans, throwing for 197 yards and two interceptions. He could be without his No. 2 wide receiver as Lee Evans' status is uncertain because of a persistent left ankle injury. His and David Reed's absence should lead to greater roles for rookies Torrey Smith, Tandon Doss and LaQuan Williams. None of the three has caught an NFL pass. Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo is known for advocating aggressive blitz schemes. The Rams already have six sacks this season after compiling 43 last year. St. Louis' top pass rushers are James Hall and Chris Long, who have totaled three sacks. Veteran safety Quintin Mikell anchors a secondary that has given up an average of 174 yards through the air, the fourth-lowest total in the NFL. The Ravens' Anquan Boldin has six career 100-yard receiving games against St. Louis.

I would like to know who these St. Louis firefighters think they are that they can take over our schools out here in the county. If you're so concerned about your children, why don't you change your job and become firefighters in the county? Or give some of your benefits up that you've got so maybe they can get decent schools in the city. But don't think you're going to come out here and strongarm us into taking your kids if we can't get our own kids into schools out here in St. Louis County. We pay our taxes. We've got good school districts. If you're so concerned, fight city hall. But don't try to act like Gestapos that you're going to come out here and send your kids here and maybe overcrowd our schools out here.

He has, according to the Baltimore City Paper, promiscuously distributed materials in circumstances where it is illegal to do so; he has lied, claiming then-Representative Ehrlich was a Nazi; and he manufactured the falsehood that Ellen Sauerbrey was opposed to civil rights, among other mendacities. He has aided, with his contemptible tactics, Democrats Joan Pratt, Elijah Cummings (using robocalls as well), Albert Wynn and many others. (If Mr. Ehrlich is described as a "Nazi," wouldn't that suppress Republican votes? If inaccurate polling — remember the Clarence "Du" Burns-Kurt Schmoke push polls — is very one-sided, won't money dry up and voting by conservatives be discouraged?)

A program's goal should not be to play for a national championship every year -- a program's goal should be to reach its potential every year. For some teams (like Alabama football, UConn women's basketball) it's realistic to set goals of playing for and winning a national championship. But do you really think it's the same at Arkansas State? If Gus Malzahn walked into his locker room and told his players he expected them to play for a national championship, and then they went on to win four games, isn't he just setting them up to feel like failures?

The electricity in the audience keeps building as the audience members are esorted up to the stage, and it's a spiritual moment. As Mr. Ailey always said, ‘I believe that the dance came from the people and that it should always be delivered back to the people'. At a recent performance a woman lost her wig onstage, and when the dancer who was her partner whispered ‘I'm so sorry" she said, ‘I'm 70 years old and having the time of my life'."

Then there's "Elizabeth," a 62-year-old Democratic Senate candidate from Massachusetts. Like Barack's white girlfriend, she couldn't be black. She would if she could, but she couldn't. But she could be a composite – a white woman and an Indian woman, all mixed up in one! Not Indian in the sense of Ashton Kutcher putting on brownface makeup and a fake-Indian accent in his amusing new commercial for the hip lo-fat snack Popchips. But Indian in the sense of checking the "Are you Native American?" box on the Association of American Law Schools form, which Elizabeth Warren did for much of her adult life. According to her, she's part Cherokee and part Delaware. Not in the Joe Biden sense, I hasten to add, but Delaware in the sense of the Indian tribe named in honor of the home state of Big F—kin' Chief Dances With Plugs.

Karin says the ex-husband was receptive but ultimately wouldn't pay up. Danielle breaks it down for us: If she sells the house, her ex-husband gets $700,000, while she gets under $1 million.

Still, who hasn't felt what Domonic Brown was feeling on Friday after the Phillies sent him back to minor league camp? Who hasn't sworn to himself that all he needs is a chance? Brown entered spring training as one of the few people - perhaps the only person - in the Phillies organization who believed he was fighting for a job. When you are 24 years and talented, you do not abide by conventional wisdom. Especially when you look around the country and see 10, 15, 20 major league cities that would welcome you into the starting lineup the moment you arrived. That, as they say, is baseball. When the Phillies drafted Brown in the 20th round in 2006, they had not qualified for the postseason in 13 years. Their payroll was worth $10 million less than the contract Jonathan Papelbon signed this offseason to be the team's closer for the next 3 years. Now?

It also won't hurt to call ahead with special requests, especially if you have serious dietary restrictions. Consider calling during off-hours (say, midafternoon, between lunch and dinner rushes) and ask to speak briefly with the chef or manager. Get a name in case you need to refer back to the conversation. At the very least, as soon as your party is seated, privately speak with the server or a manager to explain your limitations. That heads-up helps everyone.
A: I think the mother in the English story is a more of an intruder in the relationship between the father and the daughter. I wanted to create a very locked and isolated relationship between the father and the daughter. That's why that mother is some kind of intruder in their emotional lives. It was important to create and explain later on the isolation they're living. When Hollowface is attacking the house, then you understand, it's only some kind of menace for them and the mother is completely out of it. That's part of the story, how sometimes we create strong relationships, very strong bonds with people, but then at the same time, because we are so connected, we forget the rest of the world and we leave people, even important people like that mother, out of that bubble.

His insight continues. As Vicki's ex asserts that their congenitally lazy son is "trying" to learn the construction trade - while climbing a ladder as if in a "Three Stooges" skit. ("Let me know when he starts 'trying.' ") As Jeana's son Shane, wearing two huge diamond studs, laments his flagging baseball career. ("It's tough when you're trying to play up to your earrings.") As Jeana asks daughter Kara, if she can sell her dog on eBay. ("If that turns out not to be a rhetorical question, it's going to be the highlight of the season.") As Lauri jets off with her boyfriend for a vacation in Europe. ("Who's watching her children? The Department of Corrections?") As the camera, filming at St. Tropez, pauses for a close-up of Lauri's face. ("The Russians poisoned her!"). On Slade's watch: ("It's like he's got a Seth Thomas mantle clock on his wrist.")

OK, this time last year we could have said never. This time last year, Cousins was coming off a volatile rookie season that included repeated verbal spats with former coach Paul Westphal, too many instances when he stood and watched opponents sprint downcourt, and far too many times when his body language was more of a downer than his poor conditioning.

V&M and other American steel makers complained that from 2006 to 2008, they were pummeled by a tripling of "tubular" Chinese steel exports to the United States, sold below fair value thanks to China's subsidy of its manufacturers. In a previous but not entirely related steel case, the Bush administration was reluctant to intervene. But Obama's Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission agreed in the case of the tubular steel makers, and then-Gov. Ted Strickland, Brown and several other Ohio Democrats urged the ITC to impose duties against Chinese tube as a penalty for unfair dumping.

Zac Efron, who made a fast, flirty impression in "High School Musical," "Hairspray" and even last year's otherwise unwatchable "New Year's Eve," has beefed up and quit smiling – a sure sign the young actor is desperate for us to take him seriously. Alas, his Logan Thibault is anything but flirty or fast, though he is very good at walking.

There are demographic factors at work, too. Baby boomers will drive less as they age. The surge of women entering the work force and commuting in recent decades has leveled off. And the era of Americans commuting ever farther distances appears to be over. One measure of this, vehicle miles traveled per licensed driver, began to flatten in the middle of the last decade after years of sharp growth.

A: I can't even begin to explain how big that was. After we won, in the parade, we turned up LaSalle Street, I think it was. We'd gone through all the neighborhoods, and that was cool. But when we turned up LaSalle, and I saw all those people, I just started crying. ... It wasn't until then that it hit me, we'd won the World Series.

In a state with the worst joblessness in the country, Romney added: "This week he's been trying to take a bow for 8.3 percent unemployment. Not so fast, Mr. President. This is the 36th straight month with unemployment above the red line your own administration drew."
Kronos never actually has read its scores off laptops, though we looked eight or ten years ago at a proprietary LCD screen that someone had developed. It was kind of like a stone-age iPad; everyone had a screen for their music and a foot pedal to make the pages advance. But the developers hadn't made any considerations for the musicians to make their bow markings or notations in the score. That kind of put the kibosh on it.

Jesson has said such breakdowns in care are unacceptable and ordered that every death at an agency facility receive a thorough inquiry.
"We just don't have anymore left to cut," he said.
Mike Acker: Greg Oden is the second biggest question mark after Brandon Roy. Second to Brandon only because we know that the Blazers can last a full season without him. In fact, I believe at this point Nate McMillan and (insert GM here) are probably game planning for 2011-12 expecting to not have a healthy Greg Oden. Sure, he might theoretically be healthy at some point during the next basketball season, but it's probably prudent for Blazers fans to prepare for the worst yet again. That being said, who knows how good a healthy Greg Oden might be. We've seen him dominate both ends of the floor, and open up space for LaMarcus Aldridge. The Blazers have to extend at least a qualifying offer, and maybe go a little deeper than that lest GO rolls back into the Rose Garden in some other team's jersey as a healthy and dominant All-Star center. We'll all have to answer for that.

With growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer's disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The "real game-changer," he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer's disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.

However, I'm still not sure what happened to the Three Fritters: Oyster, Rock Shrimp and Eggplant ($11.75), which consisted of dozens of little pieces of fried food piled in a white paper cone, looking more like a fritto misto. They were good, especially with the three accompanying sauces, but they weren't what we expected. Frying, in fact, isn't one of the kitchen's strengths -- the fried okra ($5.50) was mostly tasteless, and the coating fell off in big chunks.
Menendez, however, refused to sign the so-called "blue slip" — a form of senatorial courtesy that allows a senator to kill the nomination of an appointee from their home state without taking any overt action other than not returning a blue-colored form to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the chairman of the committee, has said he will not hold hearings on any nomination without the consent of both home state senators, which has effectively killed a number of judicial appointments in states with Republican senators.

øOne of the most anticipated acts of the day was Cee Lo Green, the cat-stroking judge on The Voice reality TV show and former member of the Goodie Mob hip-hop group. Several thousand enthusiasts crowded around the smallish Congo Square tent for the show. But the expletive-laced performance mostly felt disjointed and overproduced, leaving the throngs to politely sway instead of bouncing or dancing to the music. At one point, during an awkward break in the music, Green turned to his band and yelled, "What are y'all standing around for? Play the (expletive) music!"

Loretta Smith’s shockingly big win: It wasn’t too surprising that Smith pulled out the win. Karol Collymore won the primary but Smith put her campaign into hyper-speed in the general, racking up key endorsements. This story didn’t help Collymore. (The Oregonian’s Nikole Hannah-Jones had an in-depth preview of the general election.) But what was shocking was how soundly Smith defeated Collymore. Collymore ran away with the win in the primary, beating Smith 36 percent to 18 percent. But last night, Smith collected 63 percent of the vote v. 36 percent for Collymore. Smith’s comeback, while done with a smaller voting pool, was more dramatic than Sam Adams’ race against Nick Fish for city commissioner in 2004. Adams lost by 11 percentage points in the primary to Nick Fish. Adams had 37 percent compared to Fish’s 48 percent. Adams’s advisers urged him to concede the race in the general election. But Adams made what was consider a miracle comeback and defeated Fish 51 percent to 48 percent in the general.

Three years ago, the Bacchus Group, which also owns the Pizza Antica locations around the bay and the Village Pub in Woodside, bought the 1930s-era auto barn on Sacramento that previously housed Tortola and La Table. However, it seems as if those restaurants were never properly permitted, so the Bacchus team had extra hurdles to overcome to redo the place. The result was that the opening date was delayed more than two years.

"We are kind of being a bridge between Japan and America and are connecting people not only in a tool way but also heart to heart," Johnson says. "When we do the tour to Japan, we invite Japanese carpenters here, and then American people can come and watch demonstrations and then they actually start communicating -- without language really. They do have that language barrier, but they can communicate because they know that they love working with wood and stuff."

Two tips: First, make sure they match. If you choose a silver-toned shower door or grab bars, match them with silver-toned faucets and hardware. If you choose gold tones, stick with gold throughout the room. Second, stay away from shiny brass and chrome fixtures. Give your room a soft, luxurious feel with hardware, racks and faucets in oil-rubbed nickel, brushed chrome or brushed bronze.
"The Firm" is tedious but not terrible; whether it will be watchable depends, one, on how much you like legal procedurals and, two, how the ongoing McDeeres-in-jeopardy plot is handled in future episodes. The leaden tone makes it hard to get too excited about returning week after week; at times, "The Firm" feels like a "Harry's Law" minus all charm.

Bailey and Barbato's sympathies are clearly with them, the naïfs of the story and the big losers in the politically created, media-disseminated morality tale that was "Deep Throat." For all the ribbing they and other subjects receive at the hands of the filmmakers — Damiano is shown sitting on his leopard-print duvet, his fragile back to the mirrored wall; the now septuagenarian "swinger count," Sepy Dobronyi, who lent his mansion as a location, is shown trying out humorous poses while Gary Glitter's "Oh Yeah" blares — "Inside Deep Throat" makes it clear that it considers itself both an important lesson in recent history and a cautionary tale. Lately it seems documentaries have been criticized for interpreting events and for trying to make some logical sense out of the glut of disconnected information we're submerged in every day. To enjoy "Inside Deep Throat" as I did, though, is to be thankful that someone even bothers to try.
People from around Southern California drive out to the Mission Inn for a day trip, after dark. Opening night is one big street party.

Men dressing up as women is rarely high comedy, unless sexual politics are being addressed outright, as in "Some Like It Hot" or "Tootsie." Sandler's Jill is straight out of his vaudevillian approach to female caricature, however — was Rob Schneider too busy? — and it says something that the only other substantial female character is the requisite pretty-and-nonthreatening wife played with sitcom-spouse efficiency by Katie Holmes.

Gold dredging is almost a metaphor for modern environmental concerns. In Baker County alone, three giant electric dredges near Sumpter standing five stories high and 125 feet long extracted 270,000 ounces of gold and 70,000 ounces of silver between 1913 and 1954. The dredges deposited piles of rock, sand and gravel covering more than 1,500 acres that reverted to Baker County for nonpayment of taxes.

The Mighty Macs was written and directed with obvious affection by Chambers, the former director of the Pennsylvania Film Office. He was a 10-year-old in Newtown Square when he watched the team practice in the gym at his parish school. His genial tale of team building is not quite the Sister Act of the courts. Pleasing rather than rousing, informational rather than inspirational, Macs is more of a sit-in-the-bleachers-and-clap than a stand-up-and-cheer affair.

That's an expansive (and, Greater Clevelanders might say, very southerly) demarcation of "Northern Ohio." The better east-west line would be U.S. 224, from Youngstown west to Tiffin, then Ohio 18 to Indiana. Cross-state truckers aiming to avoid turnpike tolls would probably use highways in that narrower Ohio strip, not loop as far south as Mansfield.
Golub, 25, of Highland, admitted he violently shook the toddler and slammed his head into the floor multiple times because his crying angered and frustrated Golub.
