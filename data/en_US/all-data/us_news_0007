1999: Should Wisconsin pull off the upset over Oregon on Jan. 2, the 1999 season would probably slide down to second best of all time in Wisconsin football history.

And that's for the best. What we get instead is an intriguing, up-close look at a mother-daughter dynamic, with its tangled strains of love, loyalty, jealousy, resentment, fear and stultifying habit. There's sadness at the core, sure, but plenty of humor. And somewhere in between, the two women -- and the show -- find a touching balance.
Turns out, the U.S. Attorney's Office says, it was Tran. The boat's owner didn't want to pour any more money into the fake fishing voyage than absolutely necessary. So rather than top off the fuel tanks to make it look like a round trip was planned, he bought just enough gas for a short, one-way trip. And no matter how hard they tried, Tran’s henchmen could not sink that boat — buoyed by that fuel tank, an unsinkable balloon of air.

But experts say not to count on Barrymore becoming the next Francis Ford Coppola — that is, unless she plans to buy a respected vineyard. “On the one hand, she could have bought a really nice property and hired a wine-making team, and the fact that her name is on it is beside the point,” says Christopher Shipley, director of sales at Joanne Bordeaux USA and former wine director at ‘21,’ who has yet to try the Barrymore Pinot Grigio.

It took all year to get the girl loosen up, but it was definitely worth the wait to get to this assertive, soulful reading of a Dusty Springfield classic served with sass we'd never seen from Cavanagh.

There also was point guard Rodney Stuckey, who regularly played in Portland when he was a standout at Eastern Washington. Stuckey added 17 points Tuesday.
The hurt feelings were eventually smoothed over. But frankly Banderas was too busy to have much time to worry, quickly landing important parts in “Philadelphia,” “Interview With the Vampire” and “Evita.” Later, “The Mask of Zorro” and Robert Rodriguez’s wild Western “Desperado” not only provided leads, but the chance for Banderas to wink, just a little, at his on-screen image.
The standout design is called “nesl.” It’s a two-inch-square platform of soft silicone rubber with nine small, soft, rounded, cylindrical fingers extending upward to hold paper clips, business cards, pens, cell phones or anything else you’d stick in one.

The decades-old federal program, known as EB-5, was little-known until the recession, when banks sharply curbed real estate lending. That forced developers to seek out new sources of money. Since early 2010, the Cleveland International Fund has secured investors for the Flats East Bank project and inked deals to fund construction at University Hospitals and the new American Greetings Corp. headquarters in Westlake.
GM spokesman Selim Bingol and Treasury Department spokesman Mark Paustenbach would not comment on any possible price increases.
A senior BP executive, Lamar McKay, cautioned, "It's inappropriate to draw any conclusions before all the facts are known." But the documents established the firmest evidence to date of the sequence of catastrophic events that led to the explosion and worsening spill, a series of failures more reminiscent of the loss of the space shuttle Challenger than the wreck of the Exxon Valdez.
The increased scrutiny may have cut the costs to taxpayers, but it hasn’t entirely eliminated them.
"It is pitiful to see a president defending ideas that are in contradiction with the policies of his first presidency," said Ms. Le Pen. "Such a president cannot become a president of the people."
But James Harrison of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a linebacker who was suspended for a game last season after an illegal hit on Browns quarterback Colt McCoy, tweeted that the penalties were "ridiculous" and suggested that Goodell's crackdown is motivated by the concussion lawsuits and a desire to increase the regular season to 18 games.
The last two segments of "Walker Evans" may be the most interesting, simply because they deal with relatively little-known work from Evans' later years. As an editor at Fortune, Evans made thousands of images of the American scene, but these images -- unlike his earlier work -- were in color. And because they were intended for magazine use, Evans rarely made prints. As a result, this period is represented in the show by the actual magazines.
"Of all the directors I've ever worked with, he's the smartest, quickest and most encouraging. . . . 'Faust' can be so tidal, but this is a juggernaut -- it moves constantly. It helps the audience stay engaged with it."
It's not just a Generation Y problem. According to the New York Fed's report, 5.3 percent of the 37 million borrowers are age 60 and over, and another 11.8 percent are 50 to 59. This doesn't necessarily mean that boomers are going back to school (or still paying off their loans from the 1970s). Rather, it may be one sign that parents are increasingly taking out loans to pay for their kids' educations. According to a February report from the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, 17 percent of parents whose children graduated in 2010 took out loans, up from 5.6 percent in 1992-93.
A Try to avoid incorporating everything you see on HGTV: the granite countertops, stainless-steel appliances, vessel sink. It is your home, and style is pretty personal, but the less gew-gaws, shine and pattern, the better the house looks and the better for resale. The person who wants everything glitzy and high-end is not going to appreciate your house.

The ethanol industry argues such scenarios are unlikely, but farmers have the backing of food manufacturers, who also fear that a federal mandate to increase production of ethanol will protect that industry from any kind of rationing amid a corn shortage.
TUALATIN -- Kyle Singler has shown that he can swish a jump shot from one side of a college swimming pool to the other after leaping from the high dive. He's proven that he can sink shots from the rafters inside Cameron Indoor Stadium.

Sotterley is older than Mt. Vernon. The first owner was Londoner James Bowles, who had the buildings built on his property in 1703. Though the lower Patuxent seems far from the bustle of Annapolis, Baltimore and Washington, we have to remember that in early Colonial times, that's where the action was, and until 1695, the capital of Maryland was St. Mary's City.
Aeriel said the six assailants confronted her group after 11 p.m. and pulled out guns. They ordered the four friends to the ground and stole their possessions, she said. Then two of the assailants began groping her and she was attacked with the machete, she said.

"People Meters changed things, but February, May and November still seem to be most important," said Shawn Bartelt, general manager of ABC affiliate WFTV-Channel 9. "It's because for all of the networks, almost every episode is fresh. You're not in reruns. Just about all of your syndicated programming is fresh: 'Dr. Oz,' 'Judge Judy.' If you're looking for apples to apples what's going on, you get that picture better in November, February and May."

Schultz bought the patent for the garment and made it the foundation for Alignmed.
Consider some of the things that will happen in the coming year:
Is there a better symbol of willed American decline? The pity is not Discovery's retirement -- beautiful as it was, the shuttle proved too expensive and risky to operate -- but that it died without a successor. The planned follow-on -- the Constellation rocket-capsule program to take humans back into orbit and from there to the moon -- was suddenly canceled in 2010. And with that, control of manned spaceflight was gratuitously ceded to Russia and China.

"They've got a lot of good players up front, some skill, nobody you're necessarily going to key on like some teams have, but they definitely have some threats up front that you have to be aware of," Detroit defenseman Brad Stuart said. "When you can have that threat of multiple guys being able to score, it's more effective than just having one guy. They've been getting timely goals from everybody and that's the key to success through a long season."
Myers notes there's still not a lot of evidence of cord-cutting, or people canceling subscriptions and just watching for free. "Yes, people want to watch content in all these places. There's a push by operators to offer more content online (with the cable industry's vaunted TV Everywhere concept), but you have to keep your subscription to do it."
“Yes. I PRESSED ON and look – still off.”
"If you're a female at this age, it's not very acceptable to be competitive," James said. "For many, many years I didn't think I was a competitive person — not just in running, but in anything. Then one day I said to myself: 'You know, I am competitive. It's probably just with myself, but yeah, I am competitive.' "

Swift didn't get a chance to respond until later, when Beyonce, who won best video of the year, invited Swift on stage to finish her speech. Later, Swift said, "I was standing on stage and I was really excited because I'd just won the award and then I was really excited because Kanye West was on stage. And then I wasn't excited anymore after that."

Carl Meacham, a top staffer of the Republican minority at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told the conference that the Obama administration's handling of the Rousseff visit reflects the fact that -- despite Brazil's status as the world's sixth-largest economy and its recent discovery of massive oil reserves -- "Brazil is not viewed as a first- or second-tier issue for U.S. foreign policy within the White House."

And it's not just in high-end dining establishments, or in haute cuisine preparations. "Your neighborhood restaurants, you'll see a lot of them trying to incorporate more local products," Wong notes. In the resorts, a new wave of homegrown chefs has also transformed menus, bringing the hearty plantation-era food lovingly profiled in "Kau Kau" onto diners' plates in innovative, and sometimes healthier, ways.
Willoughby Hills didn't give itself enough credit after smoothing out White Road. Crews left a pair of orange "BUMP" advisories alongside fresh pavement on White just east of Bishop Road in Lake County, reports column correspondent Arline Debelak Price.

"True Grit" is best known as the movie that won John Wayne his one and only Academy Award, but truth be told, it's not all that great of a film. Oh, sure, Wayne is very good as Rooster Cogburn, a deputy U.S. Marshal hunter hired by a precocious 14-year-old girl to track down her father's killer.
Upcoming purchases range from the utilitarian -- mobile computers and software-- to the cosmetic -- a standardized paint scheme for patrol cars.
In fairness, the governor and his fellow Republicans are, with good intentions, trying to do two things at once: deploy public resources, but set up a private structure to do the job. Neither goal is likely to be well and truly accomplished.

Matheny said: "There's no question there's been change. And after a team finished like they did, I'm sure nobody was looking for change. It's a cliche, but with change comes opportunity. There was an opportunity that put me in this position, and an opportunity that has promoted Derek Lilliquist as pitching coach. I just don't get too caught up in it. New things arise all the time, and I don't think it will ever stop."

The Heat have outscored the Knicks by an average of 97-77 in what could go down as one of the most lopsided sweeps ever if Miami finishes it off Sunday. Orlando beat Atlanta by 25.3 per game in a 2010 second-round series, and the only other four-game sweep with an average margin of more than 20, according to STATS, LLC, was when the Lakers routed San Antonio by 22.3 per game in the 2001 Western Conference finals.

"According to new information brought to my attention, some witnesses now suggest that the versions of events attributed to them in CPD reports from 2004 were not accurate, including one witness who now claims that his observations during one of the lineups conducted were not accurately memorialized in police reports," Alvarez wrote. "To be clear, at this point, I have no objective evidence to support the notion that there was any misfeasance or malfeasance on the part of investigators in this case. However, with this new information, it is my belief that an independent investigation from a separate police agency is clearly warranted to ensure that we reach the truth in this case."
Uriel is a difficult man in his own way — he likes telling students that their work has things in it that are new and correct, "only the new things are not correct and the correct things are not new" — but, in conversations with both his wife, Dikla (Alma Zak), and his long-suffering mother, Yehudit (Alisa Rosen), it's clear that he cares more about the father-son relationship than the older man does.

Nor should equal justice for everyone be an issue subject to the usual political horse-trading and back-scratching that goes on in Annapolis. This is different from a simple "vote for the road project in my district, and I'll vote for yours" sort of transaction. The gay marriage issue goes to the heart of values that both advocates and opponents consider fundamental, and it shouldn't be an excuse for lawmakers to swap their votes and their principles to advance ancillary causes, no matter how worthy.

I imagine she was filled with gratitude.

He said the planning commission's decision on the project can and most likely will be appealed to the county Board of Zoning Appeals. That decision, in turn, can be appealed to the Circuit Court.

Danny Knobler, CBSSports.com: "So you still don't believe Ryan Braun? Sorry, I can't help you. So you're now claiming that the process is rigged, or that baseball didn't really want Braun suspended? Sorry, can't help you. Go ahead and tell me that it's ‘corrupt,' as one Twitter follower wrote after Thursday's decision was announced in Braun's favor. Go ahead and call him a ‘coward,' as another tweeter said. Sorry, can't help you, because in that case you're not interested in justice. And as for the idea that one not-guilty verdict taints other positive tests, seriously? When one criminal trial ends with not-guilty, do we empty the jails because every other conviction must be wrong, too? If baseball or any other sport is going to have a drug-testing system, there needs to be a way for a player to appeal a positive test. If there's going to be an appeal process, it needs to be fair enough that if the player makes a legitimate case that the test was flawed, he gets off."

If you're going to make that decision -- and sign your name to it -- you'd want to able to justify it to yourself. Kitzhaber decided he couldn't do that, writing, "The single-best indicator of who will and will not be executed has nothing to do with the circumstances of a crime or the findings of a jury. The factor that determines whether someone sentenced to death in Oregon is actually executed is that they volunteer. That is a perversion of justice."

I’ll let Contra Costa coach Alonzo Carter state my case for Goins seeing time this fall: “You don’t recruit a JUCO guy to redshirt.

Goins, who chose the Terps over Idaho, New Mexico State and San Jose State, should provide depth for a Maryland secondary that lost cornerbacks Cameron Chism and Trenton Hughes to graduation.
