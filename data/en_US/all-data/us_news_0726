Craig's .917 OPS in 2011 would give the 2012 Cardinals four in the NL's top 10 from 2011 – if he had enough at-bats to qualify.

Craig has always had a guaranteed spot in the order; he's been searching for a regular position in the field. When he's healthy, the Cardinals are ready to finally give him both.

Half of the Wings' bench had great scoring opportunities down low in the first period Tuesday.

Whether Atlanta should follow Denver’s path is an open question, but the two regions grapple with the same core problem: traffic congestion so bad it threatens the region’s vitality.

The addition serves as a perch from which they can survey the landscape. On one end is a 17-foot-square living and dining space, enclosed on three sides by floor-to-ceiling glass walls held up by the steel.

That's mainly a tribute to Jason Segel's perseverance as a performer, and to Mila Kunis's fresh beauty and focused energy. (I haven't forgotten Kristen Bell; it's just that she's less interesting in a much less interesting role.) Mr. Segel has bleary Rodney Dangerfield eyes and a doughy face that looks older than it looks. He's able to operate on the margins of morose, yet stay within the bounds of broad comedy. Ms. Kunis, a petite brunette, plays Rachel, a hotel receptionist by day and a party girl by night (and day), with a sparkling smile, a seductive voice that can sharpen to a rasp and a quick wit that suggests withheld knowledge. Good for her in a sex farce that lets so much hang out.
Two more obvious dangers resulting from cold temperatures are hypothermia and frostbite. About 700 deaths occur in the U.S. each year because of hypothermia. Hypothermia occurs when your body temperature drops below 95 degrees and the body reroutes blood to the brain and internal organs.
One of the benefits of my job is being able to feed my art-aholism by seeing new work daily. However, "new" doesn't always mean "good"! But, I was quite pleased this week when I opened an email and found sample images of works by Bryan Carson and Brian Phillips. Their "Threshold" show opens Saturday, 7-10 p.m., at Twelve21 Gallery (1221-C N. Orange Ave., Orlando). I particularly like Carson's figurative images painted on wood panels. The wood grain merges with the figures, giving both the wood and the painted figures an ethereal quality.

Marvelous markets: East London's soul is in its markets. Early-bird wholesalers such as Billingsgate (fish) and Smithfield (meat) date back centuries and remain great places to people-watch and get a feel for the city's pulse. Others have evolved into far more varied and tourist-friendly destinations. Spitalfields (www.spitalfields.co.uk) is the place to go for art, jewelry and vintage fashion, and on Saturdays Borough Market (boroughmarket.org.uk) is a buzzing smorgasbord of artisan food, suitably surrounded by excellent pubs and restaurants. For an earthier experience, head to the Sunday flower market on Columbia Road (www.columbiaroad.info) to watch the Shoreditch bourgeoisie haggle with Cockney traders for their weekend blooms.

“This whole thing about understanding climate change really folds into a whole series of different questions,” says Griffis. “How is the climate expected to change, or how is it changing now? Then, based on that, what do we think the impact of that will be on ocean circulation or temperature? Given that, how does that play out for fish stocks X or Y or Z? Then the third modeling, or ripple, of that is: what does that mean for the fishers or the fishing communities who now fish in this place, but may now have to go 100 miles northward because the temperature moved the fish northward?”

It was during one of his meetings with the council that he looked around the room and thought about the need to educate the next generation of scientists to ensure the government would continue to have a valuable cadre of advisers.
"I would say we're three to five years from human trials," he said. "We have a long way to go."
No wonder U2 has conquered the planet. The home of the Pittsburgh Steelers was the last stop in the United States on the band's 360 Tour, the top-grossing tour in history, with $700 million in ticket sales. It concludes Saturday with a show in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada.
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government plans to speed up the process for tracking E. coli in meat, a move that will help authorities more quickly find the source of bacteria outbreaks and hasten recalls of tainted food.
"What we did on 9/11 was a credit to every mariner out there. It brings back a lot of the pride from when you first got your license and thought ‘I’m a captain, I’m a licensed captain,’" Thornton said while staring out at the New York skyline through his sunglasses.
The couple had heard of Mexico's cartel killings, casino firebombs, bribery and corruption. But like millions of other Americans craving a break this spring, these workaholics couldn't resist the low prices, flowing drinks and sunny, 80-degree escape.
If all this equipment sounds like a 21st Century torture chamber, well, that's the point. Plum Brook Station, operated by Cleveland's NASA Glenn Research Center, is a proving ground for spacecraft. It's where prototype space capsules, satellites, landing vehicles and rocket components can be exposed to the harsh condition they'll encounter aloft, from searing heat and sub-zero cold to the absence of air pressure.

It is the second time in a little over a year that Hawaii and the U.S. West coast faced the threat of a massive tsunami. A magnitude-8.8 earthquake in Chile spawned warnings on Feb. 27, 2010, but the waves were much smaller than predicted and did little damage.
"The court's narrow holding in this case does not prevent a strip search when the charges (such as felonies, drug crimes, and gun crimes) suggest the presence of contraband or when circumstances otherwise create reasonable suspicion," the former AGs wrote.
This team has talent. It also runs around, dives for balls, rebounds, and beats up the opposition in the paint. Oregonian photographer Bruce Ely sits on the baseline during games. He's a keen observer with a rare seat. He turned to me after four games this season and told me that he's seeing Portland brutalize opponents under the basket and play more physically than they've done in the past seasons.
Slut-shaming is a term used to describe the hateful and judgmental behavior that is directed toward women as a result of their sexual decisions (or as a result of rumors about those decisions). Cruel words like slut, whore, "ho" (and worse) are used to make a woman feel worthless, disgusting and ostracized for her sexual feelings and desires.
Stanford was playing at UCLA, so that was convenient, but on the flight, I realized there would be an added bonus. Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, Bryce Harper would be making his major league debut for Washington.
In addition to answering questions about what "movement to the middle" means, I think Mr. Fletcher needs to explain what he meant by the statements he made as a Republican. How do those statements mesh with his new political identity? Was he being deceptive then, or now? – John Murphy, La Jolla
“Our Town” follows the everyday lives of the average people who inhabit the village of Grover’s Corner during the early 20th century through three acts: “Daily Life,” “Love and Marriage” and “Death and Eternity.” The “Stage Manager” character guides the play, taking questions from the audience, describing locations and making key observations about the world the play creates.

The Commerce Department estimated Friday that the economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the January-March quarter, compared with a 3 percent gain in the final quarter of 2011. But growth is expected to rebound to around 3 percent for all of 2012 as stronger job growth spurs more consumer spending.
Canada has its Idols, too. "Canadian Idol" ran from 2003 to 2008, producing six grand prize winners. Unless you are obsessed with Much Music and radio north of the border, though, you’re not likely to recognize any of them.

In fact, atheists, agnostics, humanists and other assorted skeptics from the Army's Fort Bragg have formed an organization in a pioneering effort to win recognition and ensure fair treatment for nonbelievers in the overwhelmingly Christian U.S. military.
The players are bigger and more athletic now. West was 6-3, although he was "long" in today's terminology because of his wingspan. The Big O at 6-5 was the first power guard, backing defenders down, never taking a 12-footer if a 10 was available, never a 10 if he could get an 8.
I don't think Kroenke has any interest in undermining his considerable investment in Bradford. And at this stage, why should he? It's not as if we're talking about bringing Aaron Rodgers or Drew Brees in here. You don't throw your young No. 1 quarterback in into the flames of controversy over a No. 2 quarterback. After 2011 this is what Bradford needs: a positive and calm working environment.
Grant Burton, Diaz's court-appointed attorney, did not offer any defense and Diaz did not testify or speak at his sentencing. Burton originally filed a motion to use a "self-defense" defense but did not present it at trial.

When a pampered dog (voiced by Drew Barrymore) gets lost while accompanying a self-centered heiress to Mexico, she has to rely on the heroism of a street-smart gardener's dog (voiced by George Lopez). The release of "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" was preceded by some hand-wringing about perceived racial insensitivities, but the movie became a hit anyway, and for good reason. Though the plot's nonsensical, "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" is bright, cute and good-natured. The DVD adds a commentary track by director Raja Gosnell, deleted scenes, bloopers and an animated short.
Karzai's office said three Taliban took part in the attack: the suicide car bomber and two other gunmen who stormed the compound disguised in burqas -- the head-to-toe robes worn by conservative Afghan women.
“I thought I did a good job mixing it up,’’ Pierce said. “Going inside. Getting a rhythm. Going outside, taking the shots that were there.

The league considered two plans to accommodate Atlanta's move to Winnipeg this past summer. The first would have simply moved the Jets to the Western Conference's Central Division and either Detroit or Columbus to the Southeast in the Eastern Conference.

Money from the tickets, if paid, went to the city.

He’ll start proving it by bringing in a high-caliber defensive coordinator – Tom Bradley, who filled the role at Penn State for years, is available.

Does Damon Albarn have too many irons in the fire? Yes. That's why he hasn't cut that classic Blur song yet. But this hipster-funk summit is so infectious, you'll be glad he's been too busy. Albarn sets the tone here with a wistful spoken monologue about how he's a "pale imitator of a boy in the sky with a cap in his head and a knot in his tie." James Murphy takes the mike to go falsetto on a funky chorus hook that starts "You wanna do it but you don't know what you're doing, baby." There's a second verse and chorus, then a bridge sung by Andre 3000 of OutKast, who starts the rap that follows with "New word/onomatopoeia/Quit actin' like you don't wanna be here." By the time he's finished, Murphy's left impatiently repeating "Can we get an OutKast album now?" Well, can we?
The executive director of the RTA wants some answers from the CTA about the status of its budget-balancing efforts this year.

Oh, and there's much more. I'm not sure why "successful" Minnesota politicians seem bent on making fun of North Dakota rather than solving their own state issues, of which there are plenty. So keep mocking the state west of you. I wonder what color the Vikings will wear when they relocate?
In the performing arts, however, it's business as usual: the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra toured through Southern California in October, and the Bolshoi Ballet is due at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in June. While some American institutions, including New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, are refusing to lend works to Russian museums until reciprocity resumes, a traditional American music series featuring Cajun, western, gospel and Native American groups has been touring in Russia since Feb. 29 under the banner of American Seasons in Russia, a program supported by the State Department. The Chicago Symphony has concerts scheduled later this month in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

Every product  every slab of meat, chunk of cheese, head of lettuce, batch of carrots, even the cider on tap  is as good as it gets. You take those impeccable building blocks, and you begin to create a bond, a sense of trust that compels the customer to try more and the kitchen to keep stretching the boundaries.
The SBA doesn't offer grants to businesses, but it does make loans and provides valuable support services and counseling for entrepreneurs. The SBA also can direct business owners to reputable organizations that provide funding and other legitimate assistance.
"The uniformed services are on the front lines of public safety every day," he said. "Their jobs are inherently dangerous, even deadly. That can apply to rural and suburban areas as well."

Lang has been instrumental in helping instill a mentality in the team’s linemen that has paid big dividends for players like Bembery and all-American Duaron Williams, who is ranked No. 7 in the Sentinel’s 2012 Central Florida Super60. Lang’s passion for playing on the line, where he played for 13 years in the NFL and was an-All-American defensive end for Miami in college, is very strong and it carries over.

The Orange County Register's rankings are designed to show which elementary schools in Orange County provide the richest academic experience and strongest environment for learning – from schools with the best test scores to those with cultural diversity and small class sizes. The results generated a ranking system of more than a dozen measurements for 379 public elementary schools.
"It should be before the House as quickly as it can," Blunt said on NBC. "But we should not set any artificial time limit here."

The blackboard depiction of a steer divided into beef cuts tells you everything you need to know here. This is all about meat -- steaks on the table, butcher shop at the door -- and it's treated with the proper reverence, arriving juicy and vivid. Laurelhurst doesn't fear richness -- you can precede your steak with roasted marrow bones, or fried risotto balls stuffed with mozzarella and shreds of short rib -- and neither do its fans, who can create a waiting time on a weekday evening. Andrew Knowlton of Bon Appetit called it one of the nation's 10 best new restaurants of 2010, and he may not even have had the brisket.
The reason for the appeal is simple, said the Hart center's director, Rosanne Bernardy.
The shelter staff closed the program for a few days after several dogs came down with an upper respiratory infection, kind of like a canine cold. The shelter staff wanted to administer medications to the sick dogs and make sure the infections didn’t spread.

Then the line went dead.
If Seau did kill himself, we don’t know why, of course. An investigation might help, or it might leave the same haunting questions from the day two years ago he drove his Escalade off a cliff.
First and foremost, I will lead by example. In the Marine Corps, commanding officers set the culture for the entire organization. They lead by example, never asking of someone else something they are not willing to do themselves.
Anyone who has listened closely knows how much the OSO's sound has improved over the last decade; this performance illuminated some specifics. Parity among sections is more pronounced: the winds shone, with pure, gentle playing from principal flute Jessica Sindell and principal oboe Martin Hebert; the brass was tight and explosive; and the percussion was rock solid down to the final pounding notes. Peter Frajola, who has contributed able leadership in the first violin chair during the search for a replacement for concertmaster Jun Iwasaki, also contributed incisive solo playing.
"It is physically demanding," says the actress, who has sworn off alcohol and caffeine because they trigger migraines. "I'm being kept in shape by the show, I'll tell you that much."
Mohapatra, 42, had worked for North Logan-based Frontier Scientific Inc. from 2009 to 2011. He admitted to accessing a company chemical resource notebook and emailing the formula for meso-Tetraphenylporphine, or TPP, to his brother-in-law in India.

Those hesitant to support Mr. Assad's overthrow point to the fact that he, like his late father Hafez Assad (who died in 2000), has kept Syria's border with Israel on the Golan quiet, and that he has, on occasion, stated that he would be willing to sign a peace treaty with Israel. On the other hand, Bashar Assad, like his father before him, has allied Syria with Iran, a country that opposes Israel's existence, and is a major supporter of Hezbollah and Hamas, terrorist organizations also dedicated to Israel's destruction. Indeed, Syria has used both in proxy wars against Israel.
And, perhaps most important, he showed that even the leaders can take constructive criticism. It wasn’t long ago that Antrel Rolle called him out — funny how the defense has been a clenched fist ever since — and Tuck never took that personally. There was a reason for that: What’s good for any underachiever is good for the captain.

The big question surrounding Oden and the Blazers is how much the team (and other teams) will offer the oft-injured center: In a normal year, July 1 other teams can putting out offers on Greg much like we did with Wesley last year.
