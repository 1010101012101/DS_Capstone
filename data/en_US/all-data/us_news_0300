Portland cannot, as the saying goes, let the Lakers beat them twice. They cannot let Sunday's loss make them question what they are trying to do, make them doubt their ability to compete against any team, and cause them to come out flat against Washington.

The debate rages about what local governments should do to help the homeless. The people I met were not seeking government handouts. They just want what they call "safe ground"  a legal place to camp, permission from authorities to lay their heads down at night, somewhere, anywhere they won't be arrested and their possessions confiscated.

And then Rick is going to be like "Protect this!" and dragon punch him and it will be on like Mo Vaughn.

"But my food memories -- I mean, I think Julia Child really did change the whole thing. I recently found my knitting book at the bottom of my knitting bag from 1967. It wasn't a knitting book. It was a magazine that has some knitting patterns in it. And it was called Woman's Day, from 1967. And it's filled with recipes and food ads. And it's all Del Monte canned peas, Del Monte canned corn, Del Monte canned peas and corn, canned green beans. And all the recipes are: take ground meat, and put in artificial mashed potatoes, layer it, top it off with tomato sauce out of a jar, put it in the oven, and presto, dinner.

Mining companies are one of the last sectors you'd think of when it comes to dividends and value, but Silver Wheaton can give you a hefty dose of both. It isn't a traditional miner. Instead, it enters into long-term contracts with silver miners, agrees to purchase their silver at a discounted rate, and then pockets the difference. Nearly all of Silver Wheaton's contracts have the company paying between $4 and $5 per ounce, which allowed it to crank out gross profit margins in excess of 80 percent last year.
øOr companies in many industries, not just financial services, canned them.
Nothing against small-d democracy, but I used to live in California, where the people vote on just about everything. It's a recipe for deadlock. Capital-D Democrats presumably expect to be in charge in Columbus again someday. When that happens, do they really want every hot issue to go to the voters? Two can and will play this game, but it's no way to govern.

During the press introduction in southern Spain in March, I drove an SL500—for branding reasons, the car is known as SL500 in Europe and SL550 in the States—and, let me say now, by any other name, this car is a torque monster: 516 pound-feet of torque comes fully online at a mere 1,800 rpm. If you have the car in Sport mode, the SL is capable of respectable and nicely edgy sporting violence. Paddle-shifting the automatic transmission as you enter the corner, you'll hear the engine automatically rev to match the selected gear ratio—blipping, it's called—and the SL just rips along in a way no luxurious grand touring car has a right to. Yes, it does have an electrically assisted rack-and-pinion steering, and no, the steering isn't the telepathic rudder that the Porsche 911's is, but still, it's pretty awesome. MB's Active Body Control suspension system is standard on the SL550, and the degree to which ABC negates body pitch, roll and squat is almost eerie. She's big, she's kind of a morning-after mess, but she sure is light and fast.

Picking up where we left off: The ladies tell us what they've been up to in the ensuing months. Jacqueline has given birth to a gorgeous son, Nicholas. Caroline's daughter is dating her brother's best friend. Dina Manzo is trying to throw off the negativity from the past season. Danielle is still very angry about Caroline spreading news of her past around North Jersey, and says she's praying for all those who have done her "grave wrong." In perhaps the oddest sequence, Danielle visits "Father Richard," who is apparently chilling in an undisclosed sunroom. She lists the wrongs done to her, calls her enemies "lethal" and "brutal" (Caroline is now Pol Pot?) and tells Father Richard, "I don't want to be around those kind of people. I want you to teach me how to pray for them." He tells her to move on with her life. But then there wouldn't be a television show!

The district may be the most economically and ethnically diverse in the county. It has the third-lowest average household income, but includes well-off families who live along Lake Erie. It has the highest Hispanic population of the 11 districts, but also has pockets of other minority groups.

On the 100th anniversary of the region's greatest disaster, the legends of that time a century ago will be retold -- how San Francisco was shaken by earthquake and destroyed by fire. How the failed water mains left the firefighters helpless, how the U.S. Army marched in and blew up buildings and shot looters, how thousands fled their homes, how the refugees stood on the hills watching their city burn, accepting fate without a tear, and how they got to work and built a new San Francisco.

In 1978, she wrote "Wifey," an adult novel featuring an unhappy housewife with fantasies and adventures. Although some were scandalized by the fact that a children's book author could write about sex, the book was a flat-out bestseller. "I'm really glad that I did it, and I'm glad that I did it when I did it," she says. "It has allowed me to write up and down, for every age group."

The idea of picking and choosing which individuals deserve protection is objectionable. Ever since this act was renewed, underserved groups have been included to ensure that no one is left out of a law that was designed to protect everyone from domestic violence. Resistance to the bill is further proof of Republicans' disregard to issues affecting women. Let's hope the House Republicans will not prevail in excluding these groups from protection in their version of the bill.

It will not be a free and open competition in training camp, though. Fans should realize by now that exhibition season is a reliable indicator of very little. If given half the snaps in the August sham games, McCoy might win the competition. He has been in the Browns' offense a year longer than Weeden.

Coastal Living magazine suggests tying shells and starfish to wreaths and garlands -- great for seaside holiday homes. The design team at Country Living magazine fills a flat-sided fisherman's basket with greens and berries to hang on the door.

Since then, staffing levels have been raised at the homes, and officials are preparing standards for new behavior management units for the relatively small number of dangerous patients. State authorities also have signed court decrees mandating that Illinois divert thousands of mentally disabled people from nursing homes into an array of smaller, residential and community-based programs.
A ruling against the mandate would not necessarily overturn all of the healthcare law.

But on Tuesday, at least, the administration's supporters were dispirited.

Although this was the first “Achievement in the Arts Award” for alumni, Pingry honors student achievements in the arts at the annual Arts Awards Dinner
Friday’s performances also marked the peak of the Goerne/Eschenbach collaboration; Goerne’s baritone sounded even richer, more resonant and more expressive in this orchestral context, with Eschenbach completely keyed in on the podium with his singer, almost in a trance. They performed seven lieder and added two more as encores – the famous “Ständchen” from “Schwanengesang” and “An die Musik” – with Webern’s lushly caressing treatment of “Tränenregen” from “Schöner Müllerin” being the most affecting performance.

Maryland is facing a budget gap of more than $1 billion that lawmakers need to resolve before they adjourn in April. As worthwhile as it might be in flush economic times to help lower income Marylanders to buy homes, legislators need to question whether that is something the state can now afford to do. Del. Brian McHale has it right when he suggests that the state should consider limiting the program to those who have owned their homes for a minimum amount of time. Given the lingering effects of the recession, there are plenty of people who qualify under the original intent of the program. The state should be focusing its limited resources on making sure as many of them get help as possible, not on helping people to buy more expensive homes than they otherwise could afford.

Seeing Bent Hamer's inimitably droll "Kitchen Stories" several years ago set me up to enjoy the Norwegian filmmaker's new feature, "O'Horten," and I wasn't disappointed. The hero, Odd Horten, is a solitary and punctilious train engineer who takes a sense of power from the high-speed locomotives he drives. When he reaches the age of mandatory retirement -- and misses the last run of his career -- this shy, gentle man faces a derailing solitude for which he's ill-prepared. Or seemingly ill-prepared. Surrounded by decay, death and dulcet screwiness, Horten slowly but surely gets back on life's track.

Northwest Christian graduated three of the 2010 team's best players but the 2011 version hardly skipped a beat. Northwest Christian went 28-10 overall after facing good competition in its power-point matches as well as in the Goodyear Estrella Foothills tournament, the Phoenix Goldwater tournament and the Nike Tournament of Champions in Chandler.

The odds of being born on Leap Day are 1 in about 1,500, but several famous people have their birthdays on Feb. 29. Old-time Cardinals fans will recognize the name Pepper Martin. Known as "The Wild Horse of the Osage" because of his aggressive playing style and base running, Martin was a star on the Cards' Gashouse Gang teams of the 1930s. He was born on Feb. 29, 1904. Other Leap Day births include singer Dinah Shore, bandleader Jimmy Dorsey, and my son's friend Nathan, who lives across the street. He was born on Feb. 29, 1996, so even though he's had only four "real" birthdays by some counts, a little arithmetic will prove that he's now officially 16 years old.
Missouri's problems mirror the nation's. The price tag on colleges has been skyrocketing as state aid declines.

Does Joshpel think he will make points by singing an "Idol"-created tune? Does this guy have the most Standing Os ever in the history of the show? Really? It was a solid performance but not Standing O-worthy. I think the judges must believe they are at a Baptist church and standing up to sing with choir. So for the second song Joshpel changes it up by being more restrained. Another Standing O? This is just getting silly and I am completely baffled.

The hue and cry has been raised about the "unreported airplanes" at Spirit of St. Louis Airport. Much wailing and gnashing of teeth has been directed at the evil, rich airplane owners who can't be trusted to report their property to the state for taxation. Generalizations have been flung about to indict the one percent for their transgressions. Should the virtuous Mr. Zimmerman pursue scofflaws? Of course! But, St. Louis County residents should be careful what they wish for. With the taste of the evil, rich one percenters' blood in his mouth, will Mr. Zimmerman stop with airplanes? Or will he turn the all-seeing eye of the Assessor's office on the Illinois license plates parked in St. Louis County's driveways and show the same kind of justice to the thousands of people skipping on paying proper taxes on their more modest form of transportation?

I'm one of the captains — me, Carly Ross and Kaylin Ziemba. I like to motivate our team. We're all motivators. We try to get our team up whenever we're down. I remember last year, I wasn't a captain, but it was our (IAAM A Conference tournament) semifinal game against Roland Park and we were losing 6-0. Me and Carly were like, "We've got to get our team pumped up." So we just tried to create plays for other people, force it to goal a little bit just because we wanted to get to goal to get our team pumped up.

Don't preach as a reaction to hurt or frustration. We had a pastor who used to jokingly say, when he was upset with people in the church, "It's time to put on my prophet robes and get out the big hammer."

Some people leave feeling shamed. Some people leave feeling angry. And a lot of people leave wondering, "What brought that on?" Very few leave feeling they've heard from God.

Mom and I returned to the Inlet this past weekend for Mother's Day, but this time we settled for looking up at the towering landmark and settling into a comfortable booth at an old favorite haunt, the seafood stop Down the Hatch (down-the-hatch-seafood.com).

Second baseman Brian Roberts, who is on the club's disabled list, is the only player still with the team nine years later. In fact, only Roberts, Jerry Hairston Jr. (Los Angeles Dodgers) and Rodrigo Lopez (Chicago Cubs) played on that 2003 Orioles team and remain in the majors.

Bottom line — make sure that your score is based on accurate data.

If Eli was more comic relief at the start of his career — the clumsy kid brother who kept tripping over his shoelaces and throwing into triple coverage, yet somehow magically coming through at the end — he’s now clearly a leading man action-hero type who takes every hit and keeps on firing. And around him you have receivers like Hakeem Nicks, whose absurdly oversized hands make him seem like a member of the X-Men; out-of-nowhere sensation Victor Cruz, whose end zone salsa dance got him an invitation to join the next "Dancing with the Stars" cast (wisely, he declined); and Mario Manningham, whose million-dollar talent and 10-cent head makes every route he runs an adventure and a surprise.

øThe first time I wrote about Twitter - a few years ago - I suggested that "people really don't want to know what you had for lunch." OK, right, I didn't get Twitter at the time, and not a few of you told me that. These days, let's say I am a bit better informed. I tweet regularly, have about 10,000 followers, and it is an essential part of my marketing strategy, as it is for many businesses. But that said, Twitter nevertheless remains out of the marketing mix for a lot of small businesses.

2.) The lessee may add high occupancy lanes that create tolls with a higher rate during morning and evening rush hours. Commuters willing to pay slightly more can move along quite rapidly if they chose so. In both cases, only users pay these fees, as it should be, and non-users don't. Truck only lanes, created in the median strip of existing highways, take these large vehicles off the highway and allow trailer caravans to operate more safely and at significant savings to fuel costs and reduction in exhaust fumes — and create more room for passengers cars.

"It's nothing new," said Gonzalo Garcia, director of technology, marketing and communications for the South Kent School, an all-boys boarding school in Connecticut, though he said the "shocking news" was the $15 price.

If that's their thinking, I doubt they're on the mark. As far as I can tell, the right has a far better understanding of the power of symbols.

Awards of restricted stock better align CEOs' interests with those of shareholders, said Charles Elson, director of the Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.

"New Girl" (debuts 9 p.m., KPTV, 9/20): Much has been made of star Zooey Deschanel's "adorableness," or -- gag -- "adorkableness." But what makes this comedy promising is Deschanel's Lucille Ball-like willingness to make herself look ridiculous when it's called for. The premise -- Deschanel finds out her boyfriend is cheating on her, so she becomes a platonic roommate to three dudes -- is a moldy variant on "Three's Company," but let's hope this turns out to be a fresh take on an old formula.
Inmate numbers are already shrinking as low-level offenders are kept in local jails rather than sent to state prisons, part of officials' effort to comply with federal judges' orders.

Awful they were. Just awful. But the byline was mine. All mine.

• A loss to the Knicks wouldn't help Heat coach Erik Spoelstra in South Florida, the Daily News' Mitch Lawrence explained: "But since then, the Heat is 14-10 and now all the talk in Miami is about, well, Ozzie Guillen, who seemed to be lobbying for the Havana Sugar Kings managerial post when he praised Fidel Castro, Public Enemy No. 1 in these parts for only about the last 53 years. There’s been a good deal of conversation about the Florida Panthers making their first playoff appearance in 12 years. There’s also the typical pre-NFL draft hysteria concerning the Dolphins, who still are looking for Dan Marino’s replacement, 12 seasons after he took his last snap... As Dan Sileo, the old Miami Hurricane football player, and now a loose cannon on an afternoon radio sports talk show put it, 'If there wasn’t all this talk about Ozzie the Communist, then we’d be getting on Erik Spoelstra.'”

I got tired of it, however, over time and then returned. Strangely, to my way of thinking, I didn't feel surprise or delight anymore. Nothing seemed to have changed. The odd objects and constructions of that day reminded me very much of those of years before. I had to read the posted explanations for every artist's work to see what the work was supposed to be about, and once I read them, I didn't care. They weren't important. And they hadn't changed. If you lean a stick against the wall in one decade, and repeat it again four and five decades later, it's still a stick leaning against a wall. And it sucks the glory and imagination of art right out of your head.

Still, I was missing certain things, according to the shopping list Gallagher had created, including some neutral sandals and a taupe handbag. Because I don't trust my eye and was so pleased with what Gallagher was able to find, I hired her for a second round of shopping, which she bills at $75 per hour. (The cost for my first four hours was $300.) We hit up Reformation on Melrose, which deconstructs and reworks used clothes and over-runs of textiles into chic pieces such as leather shorts and slouchy sweaters. I purchased two drapey tank tops made from fabric overruns for $75 apiece from the shop I consider my new favorite.
The only downside for Dwyane Wade is that Siohvaughn Wade's lawyer said his client might appeal the verdict.

Kristie: Sometimes when we tell someone what we do for a living, filled with enthusiasm for teaching about insects, smiles on our faces, a spring in our step, the person will say something like, "Oh god I hate insects. They're so gross. I try to kill them whenever possible. Yuck, how can you do that? I would never do that job." That's fine, we get it! People like that are the reason we teach! But sometimes it feels a bit rude. For example, I would never say to an accountant, "Oh god, numbers. How dull. You add them and subtract them? Ugh, that sounds like a horrible way to spend the majority of your time." We would never be rude or disparaging to someone about their chosen profession. (Private note to our CPA: We love you and your work is necessary and vital and you are an interesting and cool dude. Numbers rock.)

Every dish is reworked to bring out maximum flavor. In broccoli beef ($10) he uses the cheeks along with crunchy gai lan, oyster sauce and barely poached oysters. He's found the perfect way to showcase Allan Benton smoked bacon from Tennessee, a product that has developed a cult following.

The three bozos: Portland actor Danny Bruno returned as Bud, the refrigerator repairman who freaked out when he saw Nick and realized Nick is a Grimm. Bud is some kind of toothy creature (a beaver?) and he has two buddies who are also some kind of critter, because the three meet for beers (at Alberta Street Public House).

They hide in the car outside Nick's house, so Bud can point out this fearsome Grimm, as Nick comes home from work and momentarily wonders, what's the deal with the car?

Hey, Dennis: To repeat, I said at the time of the trade that I was uneasy with it and felt they were giving up an elite player for extra bodies. I also said the trade would look much better when the 2012 draft rolls around. Sure, it's looking good now that another losing season is over.

"In winter, it's even more fun than summer because nobody expects to come over for barbecue.

Such is the case with our recent trip to Sayulita, Mexico, a quiet beach town about an hour north of the popular resort city of Puerto Vallarta. While there, a local personal chef cooked for us three nights.

Hardest thing about playing your instrument: Consistency. Not only do we have to perform at a high artistic level every time, we have to entertain visually and emotionally at that level three to four times a week.

Now that schools have been back in session long enough that parent-teacher conferences are taking place, it is time for a friendly reminder that teachers are professionals who help our kids grow and learn. They are not adversaries; they are helpers. They need our support and gratitude. Yes, there might be the occasional teacher who gives educators a bad name, but they aren't common and most often can be navigated.
The menu features a number of enticing options, in large part because Souvlaki does two things incredibly well. The first is the pita bread used in the sandwiches. These lightly grilled rounds are pillowy perfection, the kind of pita you want to rip up and stuff in your face whether there's anything spread on it or not. The second is the house-made tzatziki, a cool and creamy cucumber yogurt sauce that will have you licking your fingers long after the last bite.

Mr. Ruffalo, as the anger-plagued scientist previously played by Edward Norton, makes a point of keeping Banner's emotions at a simmer, lest Banner turn into the raging Hulk, but the point is overdone in the name of underdoing and the result is blandness. It's easy to like Chris Evans as Captain America; likability is the retro-hero's shield against contempo-hip. Chris Hemsworth's Thor is more than likable; the demigod is touching in his attachment to his trusty hammer. Jeremy Renner, as Hawkeye, and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, fill out the sextet without adding much pizazz; Black Widow spends lots of time looking puzzled or confused. Tom Hiddleston is the villainous Loki, determined to steal a potential source of unlimited energy. The cast includes Samuel L. Jackson (in lower-energy mode) as Nick Fury, Clark Gregg as Agent Phil Coulson and Gwyneth Paltrow, whose Pepper Potts makes a brief appearance, and then, toward the end, an even briefer reappearance that plays like an afterthought.

--The contribution rates paid by cities, counties, school districts and state agencies to cover their employees' pension and health care benefits more than doubled in July. Collectively, that will gobble an extra $1 billion out of state and local coffers in the next two years, with no new teachers, cops or services to show for it. Cities and school districts around the state, from Bend and Salem-Keizer to much smaller entities, are citing increasing PERS and other benefit costs as a major factor in their budget cuts. The situation is likely to get worse in 2013, as rates will rise again if the pension fund is still in shortfall.
The VTA is eyeing a Transportation Department program that provides federal assistance through loans, but there's a lot of competition for them. Last year more than $14 billion was requested by agencies across the country, far more than was available to lend.

The French part of the menu has its moments, but it needs work. Bruso was the owner and executive chef at Birches, the Canton comfort-food destination that closed in August after an 11-year run. Essentially, it doesn't matter who's cooking whose ideas, but there is some tension at Gitan between design and execution. The French-bistro fare at Gitan is not a radical departure from the comfort-food creations at Birches, but the food we tried seldom had the impact that the best of Birches did.

Naia and her monstrous Medusa dreadlocks are known for doing slow, loping, acoustic reggae versions of songs, like a natty Jason Mraz. Blake took her out of her element by making her perform an as-close-to-the-original-as-possible reading of the Adele song "Turning Tables," ensuring that Naia will be waiting tables very shortly. Christina pointed out some pitchiness and then pointed out that she was expecting Naia to do the reggae thing she's been good at. Ouch! Showing the paucity of staging ideas for ballads, (yawn) the fog and cello players are augmented by a video feed of snowballs flying through space.
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- John Longenecker, a married father of three children, was a custom cabinetmaker in rural Pennsylvania when he suddenly found himself out of a job during the Great Recession. Growing up in a working-class family that took great pride in their work, he endeavored to perfect his trade and said that he often toiled long hours. He had been a cabinetmaker for 18 years. With Father's Day approaching, he told his local paper, the Sunday News, that "It's going to be a bittersweet type of thing. I'm not feeling really proud right now."
The Mercury kept the game close because its defense was much better than it has been all season.

The main difference between aging beer and wine is that wine is stored on its side, while beer should remain upright. There is some disagreement on this point, at least for beer with corks.

Like the Oscars -- to which they are often compared -- the Beards are allergic to brevity. The program, which ran in excess of three hours, started with a resounding thud in the form of an interminable excerpt from "I Like to Eat," a one-man show about the awards' namesake epicurian. Playwright James Still and actor James Neal gave the play its debut last fall at the Indiana Repertory Theatre, and their efforts left me with the civic-minded fear that the black-tie audience (many of whom paid $475 for a ticket) would somehow associate -- OK, blame -- Minneapolis and not Indianapolis for spawning such ham.
