What's more, the term "DJ," implying a simple record spinner, is no longer adequate to characterize artists such as Deadmau5, Moby and will.i.am, all of whom headlined Electric Daisy, who have global fan bases and compose and produce their own music. One of Deadmau5's collaborators, the DJ-composer-producer Kaskade, who also was among the headliners at Electric Daisy, performs Sundays at Steve Wynn's luxury Encore hotel in Las Vegas -- hardly anyone's idea of an underground rave venue.
The companies announced the deal in July, and Express Scripts hopes to complete the purchase in the first half of 2011. Antitrust regulators and Congress are scrutinizing the transaction. The companies have said the larger Express Scripts would be able to use its size to save money for consumers and health plans, but critics have said the deal will reduce health care choices and may not deliver the savings.

Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were on the bill at the music festival, in Indio, Calif., where Eminem made a guest appearance, but it was Shakur's that had everyone talking. A fair share of the U.S. and worldwide Twitter trends last night were devoted to the set, headed by "That Tupac ..." as in "That Tupac hologram is so real it's scary."
"The scope and scale of this organization is amazing," said Bert Vescolani, who started work on Dec. 5. "Part of the challenge is how to get our programs noticed because people don't (realize) how much we've got going on."
To say that "The Giant Mechanical Man" is a small independent film is to ignore its great ambition. It dares to go where no big-screen superhero or mega-spy will tread -- into the bittersweet land of life's little disappointments.

"Tomorrow, we wake up and we start again. And the next day, we'll do the same," the former Massachusetts governor told a hometown crowd Tuesday night, well before it was clear he'd won in critical Ohio. "And so we'll go, day by day, step by step, door by door, heart to heart. There will be good days. There will be bad days. Always long hours, never enough time to get everything done."

In the worst-case scenario that Spitzer laid out, his family's 105-year-old business could fail because of Chrysler's decisions, putting 1,000 people out of work.
Let me give you an example of a case in which I think the IRS really blew it. We reported a Baptist church in northern Arkansas back in 2004 where the pastor has held a service on Independence Day. Part of the church's service even included registering voters registration (no problem with that). However, the pastor gave a sermon while flanked by two large screens. As he would start talking about an issue, photographs of George W. Bush or Sen. John Kerry would be flashed on the screen. When he said "one candidate" is fighting terrorists, a very nice official White House photo of Bush was shown; he'd then note in a mocking tone that "the other candidate believes we are not at war at all but in a lawsuit." An unflattering picture of Kerry in a crowd was shown. It went on like this for several issues. Bush was praised and Kerry was belittled.

Hey, Ashley: If a team owns more than one pick in the first round, its original pick is the one that must be used in compensation for signing a restricted free agent. So the Browns would have to give up their No. 4 pick. Don't get your hopes up. The Steelers will not let Wallace leave in free agency. They always find a way to keep the players they want to keep.

After doubling back on Trail 44 to Marshall Saddle, hikers should continue on the Marshall Gulch Trail (No. 3). After climbing 1,000 feet out of the Wilderness of Rocks, hikers will welcome Marshall Gulch's 1.3-mile downhill ramble back to the trailhead. A particularly rich array of ferns, maple trees, vines, wildflowers and berry bushes is packed into the stream-fed gulch. It's easy to see why this is one of the most popular trails on the mountain.

In the past, the Shamrock Shake has been more of a limited indulgence, much like the McRib. Websites dedicated to outing the McDonald’s restaurants that were serving the beverage have popped up in past years.
But the reporting also shows Cerf can be thin-skinned, quick-tempered and, at times, less than forthcoming, even when the answers to questions could hardly be seen as damaging. Late last month, when The Star-Ledger found that Cerf had formed a consulting company that received a $500,000 contract, paid for by private donations, to perform an assessment of the Newark schools, the acting commissioner said he severed his relationship with the firm "literally right after its formation."

Romney: Opposes legal recognition of same-sex marriage and says it should be banned with a constitutional amendment, not left to states. "Marriage is not an activity that goes on within the walls of a state." Also opposes civil unions "if they are identical to marriage other than by name," but says states should be left to decide what rights and benefits should be allowed under those unions. Says certain domestic partnership benefits _largely unspecified — as well as hospital visitation rights are appropriate but "others are not." Says he would not seek to restore the ban on openly gay military members. Asserted in 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor that "all citizens deserve equal rights, regardless of sexual preference," in tune with statements years earlier as a Senate candidate that equality for gays and lesbians should be a "mainstream concern." But did not explicitly support marriage recognition and, as governor, opposed same-sex marriage when courts legalized it in Massachusetts. "My view is that marriage itself is between a man and a woman."

The story starts in 2002, with Mr. Einhorn rightly proud of his ability to spot companies with shoddy accounting practices. He sells their shares short, betting on a stock-price collapse.

Regarding the plans to tax area residents for the sewer clean water plan, I'll point out that the city (just the city) has 66 square miles of area. A one inch rain covering that square area works out to 1.15 billion gallons of rain water, or 3531 acre feet if I'm doing my math right, and I think I am. That's the equivalent of a 40 acre lake, 88 feet deep. An acre is about 90% the area of a football field, not including the end zones. Of course the city is not entirely non-permeable surface, but I bet its at least 75% that way. And what if we get 2 or 3 inch rain? We sometimes do, don't we? And, by the way, while St. Louis county might be a lot more permeable, is 508 square miles, not including areas that are already water. So as a non-Civil Engineer, I have a few simple questions: How is MSD planning to collect, pump, store, and treat all this water? How long does it take to treat water from a 1 inch rain, and what happens if you get a 2 inch rain before you have the previous rainfall treated? Or is this something like Social Security, where I should just trust the government and am better off not asking about the details or where my money is going?

Hotel Nipton, 107355 Nipton Road, Nipton; (760) 856-2335, http://www.nipton.com. A hands-down classic. It's as if the fickle motel gods gathered up all the charm and character that was never put into the chain establishments on I-15 and gifted it all to Nipton.

Young musicians are battling uphill. With each passing year, the "buzz" musicians at the conference get older and more established.

I started out at about a mile. A gentle mile. Then I started walking a little bit farther, after a week. Got a pedometer and got a sense of how long it takes to walk a mile. After a while you get to know the distance by how many steps you've taken in how many minutes. A mile to me is about 2,100 steps, at a pretty good clip -- about 15 minutes. Remember, this is your walk. You're not reporting to anyone or keeping score. It's all about burning some calories, speeding up your metabolism, strengthening your heart.

Our deep admiration for the honeybee and sympathy for its mysterious plight gave us an idea for a great spring brunch. In the spirit of spring fever, we recommend a kitchen challenge: guests create dishes using the secret ingredient of local honey, from such L.A.-based suppliers as Kirk's Local Honey and Feral Honey & Bee. Now is when healthy bees are busy foraging new wildflowers and budding blossoms to make the sweetest, spiciest honey of the year. As part of the growing urban farming movement, it's possible to find honey crafted from the flowers in your very own town or neighborhood. With each guest as chef, taster and community supporter, brunch becomes a culinary arena. But finally the proof is in the honey itself. A symbolic tribute to the very essence of spring will call forth the Iron Chef in every cook.

As America's gas supply grows this summer, the industry will be looking for ways to push levels back down and prices back up. Major natural gas producers such as Chesapeake Energy Corp. and ConocoPhillips already have slowed down the flow of gas from their fields.

Get stomach-pleasing satisfaction. Skip the beef in your favorite soups, stews and casseroles and shift the focus to beans -- mild and trendy black beans, big, creamy kidneys and white cannellini beans. They are excellent meat substitutes because they're ultra-low in fat yet high in protein and filling fiber. The calorie trade-offs are another plus. You'd have to eat more than 4 cups of black beans -- and that's not going to happen -- to match the calorie count of one 10 oz. ribeye steak (860)! One cup of black beans delivers just 190 calories, along with 14 to 20 grams of protein and nearly 20 grams of cholesterol-lowering, inflammation-soothing, heart-smart fiber!

Hoskins directed "The Raggedy Rawney" (1988), a unique treatise on war and family in which a young soldier (Dexter Fletcher) deserts his post, poses as a mute woman and joins a band of Gypsies. The period seems vaguely World War II-ish, and the country vaguely European, but the military is far from heroic, terrorizing civilians, stealing their supplies and virtually kidnapping their young men.

Keep an eye on his pitch movement tonight. Does his fastball have some life? If so, then Wainwright could be moving down his road to full recovery. If his fastball sits flat, then that 89 to 91 miles per hour velocity will leave Adam vulnerable to more abuse. At times Wainwright has hit his spots with his pitches and at times he hasn't. That will be another area to watch tonight. That Chicago lineup is not the most dangerous in baseball, but several of those hitters have had some career success against him.

Growing up in working-class South London, Oldman’s chief plan for the future was simply survival. His father was a brooder who spent more time at the pub than his job as a welder; when he got home, he spoke with his fists.

For starters, they don't want to undercut their own candidates in what many consider the biggest swing state for the general election.

On the flip side, some major names were remarkably precise. The 2008 Migration Russian River Valley Chardonnay from Duckhorn was spot-on: 14.1 percent tested and on the label. And the 2006 Robert Mondavi Reserve Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon lists an alcohol of 15.5 percent, essentially the same as its tested result of 15.46. That seems painfully high for a wine that once landed in the mid-13s, but the number is accurate.

-- Some resorts or hotels base their "regular" rate claim on their high-season price, even when the sale price is limited to off-season visits. That well may be the case in my example: The high-season price for a junior suite at the Caribbean property involved (in mid-February) is actually $306 per night. But November is the middle of the slowest quarter of the year for all Caribbean destinations, and just about everybody there is pushing very low off-season rates.

Which brings me back to Jocelyn, who worked for The Bee from 2003 to 2008 and covered poverty. Her work for us included a 2007 three-day narrative serial called "Tackling Life," in which she tracked down 31 of 35 members of the 1992 Raiders Junior Midgets football squad. The idea started with an old photograph  the picture included LaMarr Alexander, who had been killed by police in a confrontation after a car chase  but was broadened as Jocelyn began wondering what had happened to all the boys in the picture. All 12- and 13-year-olds at the time, many came from rough neighborhoods dealing with poverty, drugs and violence. Her findings reflected that background.

At every level she has the chance to accept what's there, or go up one level where it gets better, but she can't go back. By level four, the men are good-looking, make good money and are kind. By level seven, they are all that and sensitive and share their feelings. At level nine, however, a sign greets her. It says, "You are woman No. 8 million to reach this level. There are no men here; the floor exists to show that women are impossible to please."

Still the role of environmentalism is not to bargain away any landscape but rather to defend them all.

The West has an opportunity in a critical region where it has lost allies in the past few years because of its inability to constrain Iran in the Levant and the Arab gulf region. From the start of the Arab Spring, the Assad regime has, through local media acting as propaganda machines, accused the West of providing financial and logistical support for demonstrators' "terrorist" acts.

And as Gwinnett’s population has skyrocketed, traffic congestion has become a widespread concern.

The violence also threatened one of Bahrain's key international marketing pushes. Formula 1 organizers said they may pull next month's race in Bahrain, the opening event in the racing circuit's season. Already, the GP2 Asia Series—a race similar to the main GP2 series that serves as a feeder to Formula 1—canceled its second round of races scheduled for this week at the Bahrain International Circuit due to the events there, according to the GP2 website. The site said the Bahrain Motorsport Federation requested the cancellation.

Over the years, it was easy to forget the hardscrabble way Riley -- now Heat president -- began in the NBA. He became Hollywood's Coach with the Lakers. But he was the same tough guy all along.
Which teams would benefit from a compacted schedule? Yahoo's Marc Spears argues that the Mavericks, Heat, Thunder and Bulls should fare well as they have mostly intact rosters.

The top seven finishers in the open men's and women's events will represent the United States at the 2012 North America, Central American, & Caribbean (NACAC) Cross Country Championships, in Trinidad on March 17.
It is not universally used, and Miss Manners would be surprised if it became a topic of wedding conversation. But if you think your guests will compare it to her sisters’ weddings and conclude that there must be a quarrel, you should devise a way for the bride to acknowledge you — and her mother — perhaps with a kiss as she approaches the altar.

I also still think about the Manila clams ($17) grilled on the plancha and arranged on top of a soupy, buttery mound of heirloom beans with green beans and escarole. I'm generally not wild about clams because so many are chewy and strong, but these are pristine and perfectly complement the other elements.
I talked to a very credible source very familiar with Mizzou's ever-changing situation who confirms that Missouri officials did indeed have serious conversations with Big Ten officials about a potential move to the rival conference. That source now believes Delany might have been casting a wide net to potential expansion candidates. So it raises a few important questions:
"Think about anything unsecured in the car," says Marie Dodds, spokeswoman for AAA Oregon/Idaho. "If you have to slam on the brakes, it goes flying." As for having your Lhasa Apso ride lapside, think again. An animal in a driver's lap is considered driving while encumbered, which is illegal in Oregon. Plus, Dodds cautions, what if the airbag deploys?

They're made from cranberry concentrate, and most mix in lots of white grape juice concentrate and/or apple juice to add sweetness -- or sugar. Often, there's more of the other fruits than the cranberry. But these are drunk for fun, not for the antioxidant benefits of cranberries. So for the purposes of Taster's Choice, the question was: How well do they maintain cranberries' tart nature without plunging over sweetness cliff?
What most excites him at the moment, however, and will be his focus through the year or so it takes for the center's previously planned exhibitions to cycle through, is the development of a social practice residency program. Spiak characterizes social practice as an approach to making art that is "relationship-based" rather than "material-based," that evolves from collaboration with members of a given community and builds on the expertise these collaborators offer. (In one of the most extensive such projects he organized in Arizona, the artist Gregory Sale worked with prison inmates to produce a broad array of events and discussions exploring the state of the criminal justice system.)
But it does seem that the line has blurred between professional media and citizen journalists and partisan activists who manipulate the recordings of public events and post them on social media platforms.

Dr. Hoffmann says for many high-risk patients like Coleman, it's safer to use general anesthesia administered through an IV because the levels of sedation are more precise. But that costs more money and requires much more training. Dentists can be certified in oral sedation using relaxants and sleeping pills after only passing an 18-hour course.
Romney has rejected many of the positions, some of which date to his U.S. Senate run against Ted Kennedy in Massachusetts 18 years ago. He has said repeatedly in recent years that he supports the right to keep and bear arms and is pro-life. He has promised to repeal the national health care reform law while defending Massachusetts', saying it was a state-only model. And newspaper reports suggest Romney closed tax loopholes and raised fees -- while cutting spending -- to bring more money into state coffers.

The city-owned H.L. Mencken House suffers from more than 15 years of benign neglect. While unoccupied and unwatched, termites attacked the under flooring on the main level. This destruction has been abated. Additionally, the air-conditioning units malfunctioned, causing severe water damage to the interior walls and buckling to the hardwood floors. For better than a decade, the Friends of the H.L. Mencken House and its sister group, the Society to Preserve H.L. Mencken's Legacy, have been patiently negotiating with Baltimore City to obtain a house transfer agreement. During this prolonged process, the Friends have become volunteer watchdogs of the house, acting as its unofficial caretaker.

The judge said he did not believe Blagojevich's contention, as his lawyers wrote in briefings, that his comments about the corruption schemes were simply "musings."

But Chicago's own Challenger, Gray & Christmas estimates employers lose $175 million over the NCAA tournament's first round as distracted workers watch the games online. And that's not the worst of it, said Chief Executive John Challenger. It's the loss of precious bandwidth. "The company's Internet speeds may be slower, some workers will not respond to emails as promptly, and lunch breaks may extend beyond the usual time limits. It's mostly a headache-inducing annoyance for information technology departments, human resources and department managers," he said. Sounds like business as usual.

Asaro said there is discussion to have Sacramento State and UC Davis games at Raley, perhaps against Cal and Stanford.
Both have their moments, though not enough to keep the audience, or the couple, engaged for anything close to five years, which this two-hour film can sometimes feel like. There are so many detours taken by director Nicholas Stoller and co-writer Segel in trying to twist the typical rom-com tropes, they derail the movie as often as the wedding plans, shortchanging the smart, special comedy "Engagement" had the potential to be.

Another, called Smart Actions, is a somewhat geeky feature that lets you set certain actions that will occur when a "trigger" action happens.

3. Is this X-ray "just routine"? It shouldn't be. You need X-rays mainly when a tooth hurts, if cavity risk is high, after a mouth injury or to plan certain procedures. To reduce your exposure, encourage sharing of X-rays between your dentist and a specialist. Better yet, make them available online in an electronic medical record, so any authorized doctor or dentist can access your record.

One team moved the ball well and it wasn’t the Cavs. Coach Byron Scott was imploring his club to make the extra pass to locate the open teammate and it didn’t happen near enough. The Cavs finished with a season-low 10 assists and shot 37.8 percent from the field. Irving finished 6-of-15 from the field. Alonzo Gee was 3-of-12. Tristan Thompson 5-of-13. Lots of ugly numbers.

Over the last century, or longer, crushing poverty has institutionalized another form of slavery that is commonplace, expected -- lawful. Every year, thousands of desperately poor Haitian families hand their young children over to wealthier families in Port-au-Prince or other towns with the supposed agreement that the child will be fed, clothed and educated in exchange for working around the house. That's not the way it usually works.

Who has that kind of time or money? Not I. So I went for a week instead, taking in as much as possible. My plan would take me to the Highlands; I'd spend a day peering into the unfathomably deep waters of Loch Ness, plunge into the milieu of the Middle Ages within the historic stone walls of Scottish castles and hop across the water to see an island or two. I'd also try to learn a bit more about one of the nation's most famous exports: its smooth, mellow malt liquor.

A: The biggest thing we learned is just how often they are actually in contact with people. They are swimming amongst them all the time in this area, yet there are very few shark attacks.

A pair of curbside stop signs about 25 feet apart inexplicably create a stop-go-stop-go pattern where Larchmere meets South Park Boulevard. The second notice recently popped up just in front of the other easy-to-spot red marker facing eastbound traffic, according to a Road Rant tipster.

According to a report by the California Assn. of Scholars, the state branch of a national organization founded "to confront the rise of campus political correctness," the answer is E. But when the group shows its work, things aren't that clear. "A Crisis of Competence: The Corrupting Effect of Political Activism in the University of California" is a mélange of anecdotes, second-hand studies (some of them national surveys that may not reflect the situation at the UCs), leaps of logic and ideological hyperventilation. Clearly some UC professors and programs have on some occasions transgressed the line between education and indoctrination, but the report fails to establish the existence of either a "cancer" or a "crisis" requiring urgent action by the Regents to restore a "rigorous marketplace of ideas."
