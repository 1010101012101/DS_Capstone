If you know anything about Silverton, you know it's not your typical resort — it's not even really a resort. Silverton is a mountain, a mountain for advanced and expert skiers and boarders, with no clear-cut runs, one chairlift and an average of 400 inches of snow each season. Peaking out at 13,487 feet, it is the highest ski area in North America. It's also the steepest — and by most measures, the scariest.

The Food Pyramid: Established 30 years ago by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food Pyramid led directly to the increased consumption of refined carbohydrates — a leading cause of obesity, say nutritional scientists. Wrongly accused, dietary fat was placed at the tiny tip of the pyramid, which pointed Americans toward eating more carbohydrates; a recommended seven daily servings of cereal, bread, pasta and the like sat at the base of the pyramid. Though the government has modified its stance and today promotes the My Plate guidelines, with far fewer carbohydrates, the die was cast, and the trouble began.

7. Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie): "Salt" - I almost went with Lara Croft for my Angelina Jolie entry, but those movies were just so ridiculous, I decided to go with the slightly less ridiculous "Salt."

It was a new era of hipness and enlightenment, and the '50s were just something your parents talked about, something long ago and covered with dust.

Compared to these other changes, both onshore and offshore wind are relatively easy for grid operators to integrate, as changes in wind energy output occur slowly and are predictable.

A student who was with us had been relegated to ride in the back of the pick-up. He had a better view than we did, and he fortunately leaped out just as we started to roll. The three of us in front had no such opportunity and rolled along with the truck down the bank. We ended up with the truck leaning against an old orange tree with the driver side on the bottom.

With my smoldering cigar clutched tightly in my teeth, I suddenly became aware that gasoline was dripping into the cabin of the truck. There was a frantic minute of kicking and yelling as we all managed to climb up and out of the open window on the passenger side.

Over the years religious people have been able to accept that world is not flat and that the sun does not revolve around the earth and that these facts do not threaten their faith. Now it's time to accept and love all of God's children. Religious people used to disdain gay people for having what they assumed to be a promiscuous lifestyle. I hope they will be able to support and celebrate the aspirations of gay citizens to proclaim a lifetime commitment and love for each other, and to realize that gays' petitions to take wedding vows serves to affirm the universal sanctity of marriage for us all.

Though it certainly hasn't neutralized the lust for money, now that Hollywood's executive suites are occupied by Ivy Leaguers and MBAs who report to giant international-minded media conglomerates, the lust for respectability has only intensified. One can see that attitude on display every Oscar time when the industry rewards what it regards as its best, which is why British films typically fare so well. The Brits, by Hollywood logic, are a class act, and handing them Oscars is proof that Hollywood itself has taste. It may make a lot of junk, but it doesn't mistake that junk for art. Junk, not even high-grossing junk, doesn't win Oscars. High-minded movies do.

I began to wonder (as Dmitry does every day) where I could find someone who might need a cab on a Monday afternoon. I strategized. It was also, sitting in the front seat and watching his day pass by, obvious what the pitfalls were – namely, imagine driving for hours and waiting for someone to raise a hand and get your attention. Sounds self-evident, but until you sit beside a cabbie actually doing this you don’t entirely grasp the gapping maw of time and near-existential melancholy that goes into a day of driving.

"When I was a (freshman) in HS, Junior Seau worked the Jay Fiedler Football camp and at the end of one of the days he challenged anyone to a 1 on 1. Being one of the ‘big' kids, I was volunteered by my buddies and went up in front of the whole camp to face this monster of a man.

The whole camp cheered for me, a chubby kid that didn't know if he even liked football. From then on I was addicted. All thanks 2 this 10 time all-pro that felt like making some snot-nosed kid's day.

You would think one team won the Big Ten championship and the other lost it. But of course, that is not what happened.

Answer: It is difficult for me to come up with a percentage because there have not been many studies performed to answer this question yet. What I can say is that based on my experience at the University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, more and more cancer patients are interested in integrating acupuncture into their cancer treatment. I started an acupuncture clinic two years ago at UMGCC and at that time, most of my patients were surprisingly not cancer patients but were there getting help for pain, anxiety, constipation or weight loss. Now, most of my patients are cancer patients seeking help to treat or prevent their cancer symptoms or the side effects of their cancer treatments.

What we liked: After a few hours in the freezer, the inside of the bag gets very cold and truly keeps things cool for several hours. The clutch is roomy and it seemed a shame to fill it with just a lipstick case and tube of sunscreen, so we took advantage of space and added a cheese stick and liquid yogurt to see if they remained cool. They did. It's a useful item for diaper bags and playground trips (fits the essentials: a small sunscreen, wipes and a small snack). It would also come in handy for the rare occasion when you need to pack a liquid antibiotic that must be refrigerated (the type often prescribed for children's ear infections).
Mr. bin Laden survived numerous earlier American attempts to capture or kill him, both from the air and by forces on the ground. Knowing he was vulnerable, he appears to have laid the groundwork for his terror movement to survive his death.

Today's twentysomethings hold an average debt of about $45,000, which includes everything from cars to credit cards to student loans to mortgages, according to a PNC financial independence survey released last month. Unemployment for those 18-29 is 12.4%, well above the national rate of 8.2%; and young people face an increasingly complex global economy that is credit-driven and puts more responsibility on individuals to plan for and manage their retirement accounts.
The political maneuvering is far from over on the student loan issue, and Democrats are still looking for ways to make the GOP look worse than they do themselves. The next move should come Friday, when the House is slated to vote on Biggert's bill. House Democrats are pushing an amendment that would replace the cuts in the Prevention and Public Health Fund with -- wait for it -- higher taxes on big oil and gas companies!

The Mustangs have been desperate to play a good game at the Webster Classic, but just haven't been able to for whatever reason. Coach Shane Matzen said while the end of the game was a tough one he felt the game was lost well before the final buzzer. The Mustangs struggled to get any kind of offensive rhythm. Rosburg finished with 19, but had only eight after halftime and only two in the fourth quarter. Six players scored for Marquette and three of those players had two of fewer field goals.

Not all nine pieces rise to this high watermark. The second story, "I've Always Loved This Place," gives us the Devil, fussily improving hell. It is odd and unsatisfying, and Proulx's politics show like a ragged hem: "We'll use a construction outfit," the Devil says, "that has worked in Iraq -- Rout & Massacre sounds like our kind of company."
For future reference, Bill, here's a generally good rule of thumb: If it involves the public's money and the public's laws, it's the public's business.

øIT TAKES TWO TO SALSA: Mexican-born acoustic guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela captivated several hundred festival goers at the vast Gentilly Stage with their hard-strumming style of flamenco-salsa jamming. Backed by the 13-member Cuban orchestra C.U.B.A., the duo tore between classic acoustic flamenco rhythms and heavy metal-influenced strumming solos.

The hapless Republicans and the pandering Democrats in the Legislature seem to have arrived at a miser's compromise ("Senate OKs stadium with raft of changes," May 9). They want to show how tough they are on the team, by upping the required contribution; how loyal they are to Minnesota-based businesses, by requiring online retailers to pay sales taxes, and how shortsighted they are, by trying to fund the state's share of the cost through an expansion of gambling.

"I think Steen and McDonald are both guys that we didn't see," Sutter said. "The two games, two 1-0 games, they didn't play either one. So obviously it solidifies the first or second line, depending on how you want to look at it for them. You look at St. Louis' line of McDonald, (Patrik) Berglund and Steen … they were a pretty dominant line against San Jose. Then you go into (David) Backes, (T.J.) Oshie and Perron. So you'd better have six guys that are with those six because they play the minutes.
What else? Even though Floyd's isn't open on weekdays, you can still drink until sunrise at the Center Bar, which is open 24/7 throughout the week.

I kind of group people who come to me into three groups: One-third to one-half of the people who come to me have some sort of comfort issue, like it's too hot or too cold in a room or a whole house.

Yet throughout Jerusalem's history, acts of appalling barbarism prompted by religious intolerance have alternated with deals struck by pragmatic leaders who recognized they could never keep the Holy City solely for themselves. It's fitting that Montefiore closes his densely textured book, suspicious of all sweeping assertions, with a quiet morning walk to watch Jews, Christians and Muslims praying at their respective sacred sites on "the divine esplanade where Heaven and Earth meet." Whatever Jerusalem's political future may be, it stands as a monument to humanity's enduring religious faith, in its best and worst aspects.

Meant for even the tiniest children, Molly Beth Griffin's "Loon Baby" (illustrated by Anne Hunter, Houghton Mifflin: $16.99, ages 4-8) is a perfect marriage of the art of storytelling and the precision of the naturalist. One day, when Mama Loon dives into the lake, Loon Baby waits and waits for her. He tries his own little dives, but he keeps bobbing up because he hasn't mastered the strong kick yet. Where is she? He can't find her anywhere. Finally he gives a cry, "a high-low shuddering cry, a mournful, wavering cry, a sinking, giving-up cry" that "shook his whole body and shivered out over the whole empty lake." And up pops Mama! Now there is a grand story climax, as well as a naturalist's description that Charles Darwin himself could be proud of.

How has distance running changed since you started? I came through in the 1980s and was able to have a career as a professional road racer by running the shorter events. That's not possible for any American athlete anymore. The races have gone away from paying prize money for shorter events and put it all in marathons. And not everyone can run a marathon. There's nothing in-between for the college athletes. In my time, there were far more 5Ks and 10Ks and 12Ks. Now everything's going to the marathons. That's not the event's problem, that's the sport's problem.

Where is this confidence coming from, in light of what the Beavers did at Utah a few days ago? "Where does it come from? Just believing in ourselves,'' said Crichton.

Get plenty of sleep. Lack of sleep can do a number on your body's ability to fight off illness and can make it harder to respond to bugs once you've been exposed to them.

The subjects recovered after sleeping for 12 hours for several nights.

In Missouri, the blunt bill was referred to the House crime committee, where a wary chairman never gave it a hearing. "I was not impressed," the chairman, Rodney Schad, R-Versailles, said. "It looked like it restricted capitalism instead of preventing crime."
"Even if his family — that is, his wife, mother and children — were able to travel with him to the U.S., there would be no one to pursue those past injustices. In other words, the abuse and persecution he suffered would have been for nothing. Those criminal government officials would continue to act in an unfettered way, above the law. They would not have to shoulder any responsibility for their crimes. I feel that the Chen Guangcheng incident should be seen as an important opportunity, so I think there should be no rush, he should not hastily go to the United States, because from what I understand from meeting with him, I think that that is also not his personal desire and it's not what we think is the best way for him either."

On most financial issues Arroyo showed little depth, both on his questionnaire and in person.

Whether one views division as a positive or negative for the nation, the fact is, it’s not likely to go away anytime soon. The depth of this division was hinted at in several rumors during the election of 2008 that if then-Senator Obama lost the election there would be riots in the streets that would make Watts look like a weenie-roast. Were these rumors true? We will never know because Obama won, but I would like to think they would not have happened.

» Analysis: The apparent favorite, but it's still a long way to the opener in Dublin, Ireland. He has the best blend of experience, athleticism and intelligence, but he threw interceptions at a higher rate than Rees, albeit in a small sample size.
