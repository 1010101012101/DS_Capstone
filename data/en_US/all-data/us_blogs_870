I need to wear an emblematic uniform. Not my school uniform. That’s just stupid. It’s too establishment and it’s not even that comfortable. Maybe something vaguely military. I’ll be wearing a beret already, so I won’t wear a striped shirt. Don’t want to be mistaken for a travelling Breton onion-salesman.
Call ahead - This is a small river with a limited amount of boats for rent. I had no problem but I would make a reservation to avoid possible disappointment.
People who don't have an e-reader don't like them. People who do, do. But they would, wouldn't they, in both cases? No-one's going to buy one unless they like the idea in the first place.
I have been drawing since a child and studied graphics at College many years ago, I now work as a Medical photographer part time but my love was always drawing. I started cardmaking about 4yrs ago when I bought my daughter a cardmaking kit which we did together, but I’m afraid I got the bug! My daughter preferred scrapbooking. I then started looking online at other blogs and this then became my passion and I loved sharing my cards with likeminded people.
And (new shoppe) Vintage Baby & Kids has sewn some adorable rompers for Hallow's eve, how cute would this be with little kitty ears...or some fabulous head band?!
And they're right "brainy is the new sexy." Did you SEE BC in Starter for Ten? The transformation is astounding. You can keep your dishevelled, stubbly, quick-to-punch Robert Downey Jr. (and many of you will want to). He may have his disreputable charm but he just isn't Sherlock Holmes.

Well, of course, you may justifiably be thinking - how could anyone know more than a tiny fraction of what there is to know? The day when Renaissance Man (or Woman) could reasonably hope to know all that there was to be known is long past, if indeed it ever existed. But what it led me to think about was the subject matter we choose for our historical fiction novels. I know that there are those among us who write about other countries - Mary Hoffman writes books set in Italy, Marie-Louise Jensen has books set in Scandinavia, Theresa Breslin's last book was set in Spain, and very fine they all are. But in general, do we write mostly about British history, do you think? There's nothing wrong with that if we do. But do novels about British history interest, and reach, readers in other countries? And conversely, do we get the opportunity to read much historical fiction written by writers from other counties? And if not, why not?
I've been spending the morning tracking down remaining parts for moving water around my house and realized I haven't posted about plumbing.

Fashion Week was January 24 – 27, 2011 where the likes of Christian Dior would present at Musée Rodin, Chanel at Pavillon Cambon Capucines, and Adeline André at Hôtel d’Ecquevilly. I had January 26, but no invitation, to pull all sorts of strings and do whatever I could to get into a collection.

Ben-Day dots as a definitive style, as opposed to something that simply existed in printing, exploded onto the art scene thanks to 1950s-1960s American comics and American artist Roy Lichtenstein. Using comic strips as his subject, which by this point nearly all used the Ben-Day inking style, he magnified it, drawing attention to each and every dot. If Ben-Day had not been synonymous with American comics prior to Lichtenstein, his paintings cemented the marriage between the two while also allowing Ben-Day dots to be viewed as their own art style. No longer used simply for coloring, they could be used in more stylistic choices and in other mediums.
Friday we left Minnesota bright and early at 5:00 am. I had a small bowl of Kashi Autumn Wheat with banana and almond milk before the car ride and we stopped for breakfast around 9:00. My family ate at McDonalds, but I munched on a Luna bar and apple that I packed, and walked over to a Kwik Trip to snag some berries and coffee. Nick and I went out to a yummy little wrap place for lunch and I got a veggie hummus wrap that was absolutely tasty. The rest of the day was spent at the Botanical Gardens, getting ice cream (mint chocolate chip!), watching The Roommate (I do not recommend this one, hah) and going to the Brewers' Game (lots of fun even though they lost)! Definitely a fun fun Friday ;)
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! On Friday, the long-anticipated event finally arrived. An occasion so dazzling that the streets leading to the swanky Taj Palace venue were decked in banners, the tickets for the 950 participants cost US$1,200 (I had somehow sneaked in free under the auspices of an amiably evil industrial lobby group, who seemed to believe I belonged to an unspecified embassy), and Manmohan Singh himself was turning up for the opening… Yes: the 7th Asia Gas Partnership Summit!!!!!
No, seriously. I am finally leaving the world of bartending behind for good. I first started as a bartender over eight years ago as a way to pay the rent through college. I've had so many amazing (and not so amazing) experiences. I've met an incredible amount of people, both sober and not so sober, along the way. The time has finally come where I set down my bar key and take the bar rag out of my back pocket for the last time.
With a toddler to care for while Paul was at school, all I ever got was a quick nap in the afternoon, and once school was out for summer, that went out of the window, too. I was lucky if I got an hour’s sleep a day and that’s really no exaggeration.

Melting Stones follows Evvy and Rosethorn as they visit an island plagued by very odd events. The trees are dying and the water is going bad. Thanks to Evvy’s stone magic they learn that the volcano will soon erupt and that the events are the islands way of warning the inhabitants. Now it’s up to Evvy to help them leave and survive.
As she's inexplicably given more and more time to prove herself, the irritation around her mounts. Her roommate can't wait to have their room to herself, her best friend's new girlfriend is eager to get rid of the competition and Andromeda's least favorite teacher, Ister, is taking every chance he can get to furiously search her mind like there's no tomorrow. She even finds him lurking outside her bedroom at night, hoping to catch a glimpse of her vulnerable sleeping mind.
Peace out...bitches.

Being a priest is about having a relationship with God. God lovingly provided a way for ALL to become priests, if they will repent and believe in the Son of God. As children of God true believers are not just a “holy priesthood” (I Peter 2:5) but also a “royal priesthood.”

Second, there are many other factors besides simplicity that scientists weigh in determining which hypothesis is the best, such as explanatory power, explanatory scope, and so forth. A hypothesis that has, for example, broader explanatory scope may be less simple than a rival hypothesis but still be preferred because it explains more things. Simplicity is not the only, or even most important, criterion for assessing theories!
Now that my season is over, I have been heading over to Starbucks a little later in the day which has allowed for a little more conversation with the baristas—don’t really hit the morning rush when you are showing up at 10.30. I have come to learn that Dylan’s talents as a barista pale in comparison to her musical abilities; she is seriously amazing—

Now, therefore, I do recommend and assign Thursday, the 26th day of November next, to be devoted by the people of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being who is the beneficent author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be; that we may then all unite in rendering unto Him our sincere and humble thanks for His kind care and protection of the people of this country previous to their becoming a nation; for the signal and manifold mercies and the favorable interpositions of His providence in the course and conclusion of the late war; for the great degree of tranquility, union, and plenty which we have since enjoyed; for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enable to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national one now lately instituted' for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and, in general, for all the great and various favors which He has been pleased to confer upon us.
I have amazing friends.

He, of course, tells me that he and Leah happened by accident. He wants to sit down with me for "two hours" and talk about this; have a Q&A session, if you will. I've told him I don't need to talk about it. I don't believe him, anyway, and I think he wants to try to present things to me in a manipulative way. He wants to know if we can still hug and smile and laugh together. I've told him no.
For the first time in awhile there is nothing on the schedule for a week night, so I will attempt a new dish, Spicy Peanut Chicken Salad, that has had my mouth watering since I saw it pinned for the first time. I am going to substitute the noodles with brown rice and pray that it is just as yummy.
And to all our crafty friends...i wish you a lot of fun on our Blog Hop!
Thanks for the great recipe Laura!

In the US Val Lewton collection form Warners The Leopard Man shares space on a disc with The Ghost Ship. The film has a reasonably good transfer, although there are certainly a number of speckles and scratches on show. The image is acceptably sharp and the contrast is good enough – particularly important in a movie such as this. Extras consist of a commentary by William Friedkin and the theatrical trailer. As I said, this is a crime story – with a noir sensibility, it should be added - dressed up as a horror film. I think it may be this hybrid quality that’s led to it’s being less celebrated than some of Lewton’s (or Tourneur’s for that matter) other pictures. Regardless, it remains a classy chiller that works well on both levels, and is a fine example of how to make a good movie on a shoestring budget.
That'll be an awkward exchange. I'm sure this is how it will go down:

Jaxon Phillip Epperson was born October 31, 1950, in the Epperson’s home. The oldest of the three boys, he was a good, obedient child. Raised on Loathsome Creek, Jaxon never met a stranger because he knew every soul within twenty miles of Patch Mountain. He wasn’t afraid of hard work. And by no means was there a day in his life when he wasn’t working for one person or another. He was never fired from a job, nor did he ever quit one. Whenever work was to be done, whether it was on a farm, in the coal mines, or in a business atmosphere, people would contact Donald Epperson about hiring his son out to work. Jaxon was every father’s dream son. He never spoke back to Donald. He was always the first one to lend a hand, wherever and whenever a hand was needed.
What I’d really want to say is I just want to be great, and honest, and brave, and true. I want to show the world who I am. I want to be confident. I want to be free from shyness. I want to be successful.

Tomorrow is St. Patrick’s Day….when everything is green (although I tend to stay away from green beer LOL LOL)….when everybody is Irish. A great time to listen to an Irish tune. Maybe have some Irish stew….cabbage and corned beef….or more traditional Irish fare like colcannon or soda bread….even a pint of Guiness. So here’s to you and yours….have a Happy St. Patrick’s Day. Or as the Irish would say:
Obviously colored pants are here and going to stay for a while, particularly burgundy! but who could ever ignore the current color obsession- orange! The fall-like burgundy is quickly transformed into a spring appropriate look by pairing it with a pop of orange in a sandal wedge. Thank God for cream sweaters, they are perfect for all year round.

Writing a great sex scene is like that, at least the first few times you do it because you have to train yourself to the technique mixture. In that, writing sex scenes is just exactly like writing "action" or "chase" scenes -- an artform within a precisely defined structure.
What prompted me to write this post is due to the experience I had on the weekend. As you all know, I was at the Supanova 2012 event last Sunday where I got very excited seeing all the costumes around me and remembering all my savoured hours watching endless episodes of animes (see post here and here).

However, there are two things I tell clients; first, that the word innovation has taken on numerous dimensions that maybe did not fully exist prior to this digital age. A company can be considered innovative if it manages to find a new revenue stream or new use for an existing product; it does not have to come up with a “new” product or service each time.

She pressed up against the window, staring out onto a shadowy land beyond the walls of the city, where a small train took her lover, her love away. Alone now. That was all she could feel. Broken, spurned, empty, a massive hole deep inside her where - she didn't want to admit, she hid it as best she could, she was good at lying, even though she was dying inside, she could no longer hide it even from herself - where love had been.
As far as I can remember this isn't something that we had ever discussed, but wether this is something that she realized on her own or it's something that she learned, for her to write it down and give it me made me feel like the most special mom in the world...and made me a bit emotional too ;-)
Despite the Indian Act, a person’s membership in a particular band might be determined differently if the band has established its own membership rules. However, these rules can often be more restrictive, a problem that Rémi Whitedeer, the hero of Deadly Addiction, bumps up against. For example, of the bands who have rules, many of them specify that you must have at least two grandparents who are band members or full-status natives.

I was contacted by a representative of the Frisco (Texas) Public Library after my interview with the AWESOME Seven Impossible Things Before Breakfast blog, asking if they could use the picture of me reading to Clementine on their promotional brochure for their "Books for Babies" program. I couldn't say "YES!" fast enough! What an honor! They have this fanTAStic program that's a partnership between the library and other organizations that provides a board book and information on nurturing readers for new parents for EVERY baby born at the Centennial Medical Center in Frisco, Texas. We have a similar program here in Multnomah County and we LOVE it!
Team owner Zak Brown had the following to say in light of the announcements: “I’m very excited about our new team racing in Asia in United Autosports’ first year of competition.

Before my friend and I made the 3.5 hour drive back to Brandeis, we stopped into a crepe place called The Skinny Pancake for brunch. Normally, crepes aren’t vegan because they have eggs and milk in the batter; however, this place offered a vegan shell. I’ve only ever been to one other crepe joint in St. Louis, Missouri that offered a vegan shell–Roosters downtown at Locust and 11th. The one at Roosters was to die for, but unfortunately, the one at The Skinny Pancake didn’t live up to my expectations.
The link with America continues in the quatrefoil stained glass in the apex of a window in the north wall, in which the initials ‘E.S.’ commemorate the death in 1600 of Edmund Sherman. Between 1633 and 1640, eleven of Edmund’s family emigrated to New England, their descendants going on to shape American history as a co-founder of Rhode Island, Philip Sherman (who was born in Dedham in 1610 thus making him one of the family members who made the perilous journey across the North Atlantic); a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, Roger Sherman; a Civil War General, William Tecumseh Sherman (after whom the Sherman tank is named); the 27th Vice President of the United States, James S. Sherman; and two Second World War US Navy Admirals, Frederick C. Sherman and Forrest Sherman, the latter still remembered in the name of a current US Navy Destroyer. How different American history may have been if a family from a small but prosperous Essex village had decided that their future lay in the Stour Valley and not across the Atlantic.

But even that would do.
Then like a silly cat I slunk off like a dirty rat. I stopped and stared under the couch for a second or two and that's when the laptop came into view. Pat pushed the couch back and poof there is was back at our rack. It seems some silly cat knocked it on the floor and then proceeded to push it some more. He hid it under the couch to avoid trouble, thinking he may have popped its circuit bubble.
Well… maybe not…

I should probably just go on record and reveal that I first learned of the Asymmetric Threat Division - by name - back in 2005. I was under the impression the name of the group was classified and thus never revealed it. I was also once told that Kirk von Ackermann was possibly one of the finest intelligence officers to work for the DoD in the last century. He was said to have had an incredible talent for connecting seemingly unrelated details. I was told his work saved lives - literally.
E spotted Macy's "The World's Largest Store," and remembered it from "Miracle on 34th Street." Of course, we had to go in. Sure enough...it's a HUGE store. We all found things we'd love to have (this pattern was on sale and I was SORELY tempted to have it sent home to replace our dwindling 15-year-old wedding set, but thought better of it). An ice cream counter called out to us, but we paid no heed, opting to save ourselves instead for treats later in the day. A true shopper would have a heyday in this store, and a recovering shopaholic could easily fall off the wagon here and do some serious credit damage.
A recording of a session at my place, almost exactly twelve years after the previous song, of a song made famous by Super Biton from Segou. Flani was a good friend of Biton singer Mamadou 'Percey' Doumbia. This song was never part of the Djata Band repertoire, so you can hear Zani switching to more suitable chords, displaying a great talent for improvisation. Zani and Flani were in Holland to perform in the 'Opera Bambara' with the title "Fura". I'll post more songs from this session at a later date.

Finally, it is difficult to imagine, as the trial court did, how the non-impairment clause could apply with respect to the prayer to enjoin the respondent Secretary from receiving, accepting, processing, renewing or approving new timber licenses for, save in cases of renewal, no contract would have as of yet existed in the other instances. Moreover, with respect to renewal, the holder is not entitled to it as a matter of right.

There's been a lot of exciting new developments on the West Kent brewing scene over the last 18 months or so. I had other concerns during this time and unfortunately many of these developments passed me by, but as I begin to recover from my annus horriblis I'm taking note of what has occurred so that once I'm firmly back in the saddle I know which new beers to look out for.

In a devastating crash on April 23rd in west suburban Naperville between an Indian Prairie School District bus and a van, twenty-three-month old Jada Akyea died on Sunday evening. The bus driver, driver of the minivan and another four and a half year old passenger were taken to Edward Hospital in Naperville, but none suffered life-threatening injuries. Preliminary investigation indicates that the driver of the minivan swerved to avoid hitting a vehicle directly in front of her, entered oncoming northbound traffic and was struck by the school bus.
I overlooked this play when it was at the National, then I started reading fantastic reviews when it transferred. James Corden was tweeting about his role in it, Stephen Fry (I think) was praising it. Definitely time to go and see it – except it was completely sold out.
Why is there so much failure in the Modern Church? I believe the answer lies in the fact that many of those who are serving in 5-fold Ministry positions were called by men (maybe even their own selves), not God and others are acting out of their own vain imaginations. As a result, there is no true priestliness.

At the same time it’s worth bearing in mind that morality laws are a double-edged sword. Today’s accuser could end up tomorrow’s victim. It’s arguable that justice without mercy is merely revenge.

It's available on iTunes for 99 cents to download and having never owned an i-Pod myself and only recently an i-Phone user I was totally unfamiliar with the process of even downloading an i-Tunes song until now. For those of you who know how to do it just search 'Joshua Louis' and the song is at the top of his recordings or you can follow this Link. For those like me who don't, you'll have to get the iTunes app first on your desktop or PDA if you don't have it and you'll be able to download it then.

Neither of us were strong enough to do anything about each other’s pain-not for the lack of trying. Looking back I didn’t understand anything about him nor he with me. We were bashing our heads against a wall. I’ll never forget the day I found out he had been having an affair. I’ve felt crushed plenty of times in my life but never like that. I laid in our sons nursery (who was 14 months at the time) and cried. Cried for not being good enough to keep my husband’s attention, cried for the baby we created together when he did love me, cried. There is no feeling like being told, “I love you but I’m not in love with you.” What the hell does that mean anyway? My translation is “I don’t want to tell you that I’m an attention whore and care only about myself, you don’t do it for me anymore.” My heart felt ripped in a million tiny pieces. It hurt to breathe, to shower, to get dressed, to love and take care of my sweet son who had no idea why his face ended up wet with my tears when I rocked him to sleep. After the initial shock of realizing your relationship is over, the only thing left is this raw feeling. Like you’ve been skinned alive and there’s nothing to protect you.

It's not really a beer book as such - it's a bit of a departure on that score (though there is one chapter that centres on one of the most famous breweries the world has ever seen). But it is a book about pubs - not just this one pub, but all pubs, especially inns. These days we use words like 'inn', 'tavern', 'alehouse' and 'pub' interchangeably, but at one time the differences were so stark they were enshrined in law. One aspect of the book is the story of how inns were essentially the lynchpins for Britain's entire economy, facilitating the movement of goods, money and people that enabled both the Industrial Revolution and the growth of a mercantile class. Before we had town halls, municipal buildings, assembly rooms, theatres and concert halls, the inn was the only building in town with large meeting rooms and spaces, and it performed all these functions.

Moving onto the older readers from 12 through 15, there is plenty of advice and fiction from Kids Can Press and a good place to begin is Think Again by JonArno Lawson and illustrated by Julie Morstad ($16.95) that is filled with short poems, couplets that provide some very good advice for those approaching a new level of maturity. Along the same lines is Girl in the Know: Your Inside-and-Out Guide to Growing Up by Anne Katz, R.D., PhD and illustrated by Monika Melnychuk ($18.95) that I would surely recommend to parents of girls approaching and entering their teen years. It deals with a lot of topics parents can often feel uncomfortable discussing and does so with excellent advice. Fiction is well served in James Leck’s The Adventures of Jack Lime, L.M. Falcone’s The Midnight Curse, and Susan Hughes’ Virginia.
I know that it's only a car and that it is me that matters. But this car of all the cars I've ever owned meant a great deal to me. It was a symbol of my survival from cancer, it was bought with my critical illness insurance. It made me feel endless joy in the summer with the roof down. Okay the down side of that was my frightful fear of dealing with snow in the winter! I'd bought it from new, it had never let me down, it loved been driven hard, and it looked so damned sexy.

The Texans were on the road this past weekend against the soon-to-be Los Angeles Jaguars, and I've been so disheartened with their entertaining yet choking performances that I couldn't even watch the game. So instead the wife made the decision that a full 99 hours of DVR and a queue of literally 5 years worth of Netflix is not enough, that she went to damn entrance of the Wal-Mart for the Redbox of Transformers 2. Pretty good movie, a basic CGI and explosion orgy with a healthy amount of racism. Three of my favorite things. All we needed was for Megan Fox to pop out of that top for the brothas out there. The movie ended just in time for us to see the Texans blow it again.

Let’s kick off our discussion of books by beginning with our ABCs. If you haven’t already discovered Sue Grafton’s New-York-Times-bestselling Alphabet books, you are certainly missing one of the most addictive series out there today. More than 10 million copies of her work are in print, and her novels have been translated into 26 languages. Kinsey Millhone is the female version of the hard-boiled private-eye detective, but one who is softened around the edges. She is self-reliant, tough, smart, and brave, yet a human and sympathetic character with whom readers can readily identify.

Slowly the machine began siphoning blood into a glass receptacle while pumping a formaldehyde solution from another. It made a loud gurgling sound, kinda like a water cooler makes as it empties. Not that it mattered he wouldn’t have heard her screams anyway. When the fluid hit her vein it felt like someone had set her on fire. Inside her organs began to seize while her heart circulated the fluid through her. The pain was immense like being burned from the inside out, her mind screaming in agony. He had turned away to adjust the flow completely oblivious to her horrific suffering. It was only at the moment of death did her body finally release her from its prison. He turned back around to find her body arched off the table convulsing in agony. Her eyes bulging out,the awareness in them plain to see, her mouth open trying to scream.

I see two key parts to that statement. The first is that we are all born as sponges, capable of taking in a wide variety and depth of information. This is easier to do when you are younger, I think, because when you are young you haven’t been as restricted by the rules and guidelines and cultural norms that can create our own “internal editors” that tell us right from wrong, good from bad. As we grow older, some societal norms gradually beat that natural-born curiosity out of us – and that therefore, as unschoolers, our job is more to remove barriers to learning and boundaryless intellectual curiosity for ourselves and our children. The second point is that children will learn best when they have the freedom to learn what, when, and how they want. Think about that.
I am IN Christ…not only do I belong to Him, but I am IN Him and He is IN me. The old has passed away and BEHOLD! The new has come. Like a relative or friend that has passed away, I don’t want to forget them (or the old me) because they have taught me things. They have helped me be who I am today. The old “me” has helped me be the “me” I am today. Ta-da! (Behold!) I am here and I am new! Trust me, if you take this verse and apply it to yourself then you’ll understand me when I say, “WOW!” And, we all need WOW in our lives! Just ask Jesus if I’m right…He is the Maker of WOW after all!

And then looky at what I got!! Oh, this is a sweet little techie tool! I got it so that making the 'wee' videos would be easier. It is only 8" tall and extremely light weight, so I can drop this in my purse when traveling or a hundred other reasons! The legs bend into all kinds of configurations and will even wrap around a pole. It will also help me 'stream live' when I get to that point which should be next month sometime. I'll do a test broadcast soon, so watch for that!!

I can’t say that it brings to mind any other novel for the moment. It is quite unique for me, with regards to the plot and setting. Maybe the part where Dède goes over to Halifax makes me think of The Sea Captain’s Wife by Beth Powning, but perhaps more so Daughter of Fortune by Isabel Allende.
Like anything else in shooting, and especially defensive shooting, forethought and training make all the difference in the world. If it's professional training by people who know what they are doing, that's great! For the other 98% of us who can't buy ourselves that little present... we'll just have to do it on our own. Sure, such self training may not be the bleeding edge of knife.... but it's still light years ahead of no training at all.

You couldn’t hold a gun to my head and make me live where you do. It doesn’t make either right or wrong – it’s just a statement of fact. In some ways I’m envious of the “safe”

Ironically, in our desire to fulfill our own self-serving motives, we have lost touch not only with our inner world and fellow humans, but of the fact that the earth is a living and breathing organism. The earth is, like us, alive and intelligent. It is our own intelligence that led to our arrogance. We are of the belief that we reign supremacy over other non-human kingdoms, whose members are, like us, also intelligent beings. They are, like us, evolving and serving their own purposes, in accordance to a Divine Plan.
Being a product of the 70s myself, I can totally vibe on the look of that time– right down to the biased wood slats and overgrown plants. As a matter of fact, the 70s are feeling pretty good right about now– with a little update of course.

It’s a noble endeavor Mr. Holmes– I love how it feels like a living, breathing tapestry, and of course the sentiment behind it is beautiful. Can you smell the patchouli?

When talking about Norwex, the Enviro Cloth is the perfect place to begin for it is the product with which the company started. The Enviro Cloth is a microfibre cloth. Norwex boasts of their higher quality microfibre. Typical microfibre measures 1 denier while Norwex microfibre measures 0.14 denier (that's 1/100th the size of a stand of human hair). Because of this, it picks up and removes dirt and bacteria much more effectively. There is another extra-special component to the Enviro Cloth (as well as many other Norwex products). Silver is woven into the microfibre of these cloths. Silver is naturally antibacterial, and thus by using these cloths and water alone you will kill 99.99% of bacteria. No cleaners required. The silver also helps to keep the cloth itself clean, meaning you can use the cloth a few times and only rinse it out between washings. It also keeps your hands safe from a transfer of germs while using it and prevents cross contamination between surfaces. At every Norwex party I've been to, the consultant loves to shock the guests by informing us that we can safely use an Enviro Cloth to clean our toilet then go straight into the kitchen and wipe our counters. They have done tests with results showing that not only is there no cross over of bacteria from the toilet to the counters, but the counters are left cleaner afterwards.

I wanted the band around it to look like a chalk board so I added a two inch band of black card stock and attached a yellow corrugated scalloped border along the top and bottom.

He was right next to them. He was the very stranger that they were talking to. This is extremely important. In our everyday life experience, we may feel far removed from the resurrection of Jesus. We may feel like it has nothing to do with us, like from now on we just have to get on with life as best we can. But Jesus is walking right next to us. Feeling or no feeling, whether we can perceive it somehow or not, the Resurrection of Jesus was real, and the resurrection life that he offers us is just as real.

Actually it's been a couple days passed a week but I didn't get to post this in time. Anywho, I'm having fun playing with my Kindle especially browsing through the top 100 free Kindle books. More importantly, reading from an e-reader is not as bad as I thought it'd be. It's quite portable, user friendly, and great for night reading (I don't have to disturb hubby dear by turning on my nightstand lamp; the Kindle's adjustable light provides excellent illumination). Oh, and I was able to transfer my pdf books to it! I was so jazzed about that! However, as great as it is, I'm still a big fan of printed books. The comfort of being able to flip through the pages quickly, bookmark, and overall sensory aspect of print ..smell, touch, see ..is unmatched. Also, for review purposes, a printed version allows easier access to reference back ..as least in my case since I haven't utilize the bookmarking feature and such on the Kindle.

I call the fourth-line the checking line because the “Disco” line of Jordan Staal with Matt Cooke and Tyler Kennedy does not defensively swarm the elite players on the opposite team; they chew up valuable time in the Offensive Zone and provide excellent offensive depth, but they do not physically wear-out the likes of Claude Giroux the same way Braden Schenn wore out Sid and Sean Couturier and Talbo wore out Geno. It may be time for a true “checking unit” ala New Jersey’s John Madden-Jay Pandolfo or Anaheim’s Rob Niedermeyer-Sammy Pahlsson-Travis Moen if the Pens are to continue playing in a Division featuring Giroux, Marian Gaborik, Ilya Kovalchuk, John Tavares, etc.

When I first saw my copy of The Cradle by Patrick Somerville, I was drawn to the picture of the old-fashioned cradle on the back of the truck, as well as the synopsis of the novel that discussed how a young husband-to-be heads out in search of a cradle that his wife remembers from her childhood. I thought the novel would be touching, but I never envisioned how many twists and turns it would entail.
I had let my Other know what was up, and he dropped what he was doing to sit with me. I don’t know what had snapped in my mind, but as he prepped a pot of tea for me to drink, I sat on the floor and let tears fall. I don’t really know where they were coming from, but they came and I didn’t have any real reason to stop them. In retrospect it really feels like something ‘broke’. Almost like I hit a level, or reached the next level, or uncovered something in my brain… something, and now all hell has broken loose. It’s like I’ve fixed the first layer of issues, and now my brain has decided it wants to go deeper. And ironically in a matter of a few hours, my body went from feeling great to feeling like it used to- in pain and not cooperating with me. Ironic how the mind can effect our health.
Now don’t get me wrong, I really do love to eat. I do love watching Christopher in the kitchen. I do love helping pick out new dishes to try, and helping choose flavors that I hope he uses in our next meal. I love to decorate the table. I’ll even do the dishes.
NBC – As alluded to, NBC is a mess. The good news about that is they’ve kept shows on that have been disastrous in the ratings, but are excellent. I much prefer this to CBS having a bunch of hit shows that I think are terrible. At some point they need to find a way to have some ratings success along with good shows, but that balance is far from being achieved after years of previous mismanagement.

One project I didn’t pin but tried was growing my own green onions from the leftover bottom of green onions. We have been able to have the same set of onions grow twice and have used them for Hawaiian Haystacks. All you do is stick the white parts with a little bit of green left in some water. I put it in on our window sill for good measure.

Look what happened to Gary Megson at Bolton and Sam Allarydyce and Ruud Gullitt at Newcsatle. Pardew will not be allowed a single error of judgement before the fans turn against him, and then the press will all pile on. I predict that the reign of Pardew will be nasty, brutish and short.

During my walk, the rain let up, and that gave way to a cold mist and light fog, so the camera stayed tucked inside my parka most of the time.

Today, I wore my parka, and had no urge to unzip it.

Identity really becomes material as one traverses the landscape of the exhibit. The promise of photography as a medium is its ability to record difference and time.

The idea of the subject becoming an individual breaks with a historical trajectory that has tried to demarcate the boundaries of humanity and those included within its purview. The other and their existence, their minor status within the social, have been shown to be a conscious construct of those (regardless of number) who have ascertained power in relation to those subjected to it. “One ever feels his twoness . . . two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder.”[3] One ever feels their status and the status that has been imposed on them. DuBois would go further to say that “[i]t is a peculiar sensation, this double-consciousness, this sense of always looking at one’s self through the eyes of others, of measuring one’s soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity.” The work of Zoe Strauss is an attempt to reconfigure the image of those with this double consciousness. Those that are subjected to the discursive laws of society and made to feel a “twoness” as the result of the unity of the multiple forces that constitute their identity being torn between two ends or points in the landscape that make up or social-hierarchical structure. To render the invisible not merely as a form of representation but to begin the process of expressing the identity of those within the photographs at that particular instance in history.
Ok, I’m done being a jerk, on to what matters: ma girl Skylar. The opening medley with Queen made it clear from the get-go that Elise and Skylar were going to be the strongest of the night, but holy balls was I totally unprepared for Skylar Laine to quite literally rock my face off. Just watch:

This is the last official day of the holiday season here in Sweden. The kids go back to school tomorrow and that means Mommy goes back to work full-throttle. I'm so behind, I don't think I'll know where to begin. Been thoroughly enjoying the sleep-ins till 9 every morning too. Waking up at 6:45 is gonna be murder on all of us tomorrow that's for sure. But truth be told, I'm actually looking forward to getting back to the grind. Too much lazy time. Too many carbs, not all of which I've enjoyed.

And there’s something about eating a food so rare, so sought-after, and so drop-dead simple to prepare. Warmed in butter, morels relax and bloom, releasing their rich, woodsy flavor to mingle with the sweet, toasty fat. A glug of cream may seem a tad over the top, but for me, it’s the clincher. Stirred around the pan, it picks up any slips and nubs of flavor stuck to the surface, and it slides around the mushrooms like a soft, velvety cloak. All told, it goes down astoundingly well with a gin and tonic, just so you know, and a green salad is nice too, and piles of summer fruit for dessert. Sighing is optional, but suggested.
People were going about preparing water, doing washing, cooking, (some group was even praying. I really wanted to ask them who they were, but it was a bit awkward). The campsites were so close that it was impossible not to see it. I even had this idea to invite our neighbours (our neighbours were this middle aged Chinese couple. It seemed that the husband there was leading his wife into backpacking) to have a common dinner.

One thing he wants me to do is connect with other people to have them help me through those dark moments. I explained that it's tough to do at 2:00am. He asked me to try to find a way. I have a few friends on facebook that are night owls, so I am going to connect with them and just ask if they will stay available on chat when they are up late. Then I need to make sure I stay logged into chat and take advantage of it. He would like me to practice whenever I'm up late when I'm not in crisis. That way, I'm more likely to take advantage of it when I am in crisis. If anyone out there reading this would like to be my friend on facebook, who might be willing to help sometimes, let me know (send me an email or a facebook request -- Robin Reed Grosland). I'm not asking anyone to stay up waiting for me to need help. But the more people I have on call the more likely I'll find someone when I need them.
Just as the reward in most Myth-based films is rescuing a person or persons, so Jesus' reward is rescuing us from Death. Holman Hunt's famous painting The Light of the World shows how Jesus becomes a sort of Herald to knock on the door of our life. We can Refuse the Call if we wish. This image reminds me of 2004 film, The Polar Express. The conductor on the train holds a lamp and invites children to join. But he never insists. The Conductor says this: "The thing about trains... it doesn't matter where they're going. What matters is deciding to get on."
Also, about that very mediocre photo that accompanies the article. Yeah, that's my family and I took the shot. That very meh photo was the best of dozens of shots taken over three photo sessions. The best. I'm not sure if that says more about me, my camera or my subjects. Ugh.
In the seventh image I cropped out the dresser so that Peedy could be balanced with the chair. I think that this changes the photo because Peedy is the first thing that is shown in the picture instead of the dresser. I revised the file name as ZakeyaMurphys Peedy Balance Crop

Looking back now we have the advantage of 20/20 hindsight and sales figures. Sure, Nevermind sold a gazillion copies, influenced everything from dorm parties to fashionistas, broke punk, is on every critics top albums list, and contained one of the biggest songs of the past 25 years. Nothing’s Shocking ushered in the beginning of alternative music long before it’s early 90′s heyday. Before Gun’s n Roses put the final nail in hair metal’s coffin and Nirvana shoveled the dirt over the casket. The record contains sing-along folk, trippy epics, funky metal, and just enough production to create a well concerted effort that doesn’t sound contrived or dated. The songs are all over the musical spectrum but the album is able to maintain the cohesiveness of a great mix tape.
I recently completed a short course at RMIT called "Writing for Children" (which I would highly recommend)! I suppose it took over three years all up from first writing the story to launching the book. I really just listened to the story the children told me and basing it on the rhyming verse of the original song, re-wrote the lyrics. The children did the illustrations for me, and then just by chance, I had a friend who introduced me to a wonderful publisher, who had actually published the original "From Little Things Big Things Grow" book. She was really interested so it was then a matter of raising A LOT of money to cover the costs of designing, printing and publishing the book (this took a long time!). We also had some Timorese artists do some illustrations for the book and I (with the help of two Timorese friends) translated the story into Tetun. It was a lot of work getting this book together, but I was incredibly motivated by the passion and strength of the children that day in the classroom who asked me if they could make a book!

Like many people in the Colonial service, he became devoted to the country he was sent to. He lived as one of the ruling classes of course, as was normal at that time. I'm not making any judgment, comment or anything else on British or any other colonialism - that was then, this is now, it would not be appropriate now for an Englishman to rule an area with a load of African servants and I'm not justifying it. But he did care about the people under his care and felt them to be his responsibility, personally as well as professionally.

I love bread baking! It is such a sense of accomplishment when the bread rises to a perfect loaf. I have been trying to get a good 100% whole wheat for a while. I kept going back to the one in the King Aurthur All-purpose baking book. One day I decided to try the molasses version instead of honey or sugar. The result was an amazing loaf that was rich and wonderful for sandwiches.

I grew up with my Scottish Grandmother living in the house with us. She was in charge of feeding the birds and making the coffee. She did an impeccable job with both. Grandma Ann would perk the darkest, richest, hottest coffee you could imagine in a Corningware stovetop percolator. Since as early as I can remember, (3 maybe?) I used to sit with her and dunk "frycakes" (aka plain doughnuts) in coffee. For me, my morning espresso is much more than a jolt of caffeine. It is about nostalgia, a ritual and the comforts of home.
We will only be GIVING access (for free) to those who are already our clients. This is the only way to make things fair, and not arbitrarily try to pick from an ever expanding list of followers who we would then have to somehow choose based on starting date and known history of posting—i.e. it would be impossible to choose. Therefore, we will give access to our clients and will have to charge everyone else. Yes, to me this feels very “sales pitch-y” and sort of makes me feel creepy, but I also know that every dime will go back into travel expenses for us to have coaches at no less than two Regionals every weekend. So fuck it: I’ll stop feeling bad. I’ll also feel like less of a weirdo if I don’t have to pay completely out of pocket to travel around watching people work out. In some parts of Europe that’s actually illegal.
Surely, during the week-long program, it will be talking, one time or another, about the country’s etymology, history, politics and government, geography, demography, ethnicity, education, economy, our cities, our religion, our culture and society, our cuisine, and anything that is unique, which makes foreign nationals comment, “only in the Philippines!”

Smooth, like an oatmeal stout should be, but still a lot of alcohol. And that's weird, for a standard stout. It diminishes fairly quickly though, and gives way to a nice roasted coffee flavor.
This feeling became more apparent as we entered the yard. Everywhere we looked was perfect – the money exchange swapping our sterling into Austrian schillings, the decorative bars in all their faded glory, the secretive gambling club upstairs, the spivs trying to barter watches and nylons. Every new arrival brought a book to leave behind – later to be swapped or given to charity - resulting in a heaped table filled with treasure.
I had a quiet St Pats day this year mainly due to the terrible situation in Japan as a result of the recent earthquake and tsunami...As some of you would know by reading some of my previous reviews on PROPER BEER MATE I have family and friends in Japan, all are fine and safe thank goodness.....Thanks to all my friends/colleges/family who have expressed their concern and a big GAMBATTE (GOOD LUCK!) to all the people of Japan to overcome this disaster.
Several factors contribute to this personality divorce. One of them is the way that the internet encourages a kind of filterless sharing. Humans have always had an inner monologue and an outer persona—but most humans have the social know-how to recognize that not every thought ought to be shared at any given moment. Usually we learn this lesson as children. Have you heard the story about the little boy with his grandfather at the store? They were in line behind an obese woman. Suddenly, her beeper went off, and the boy announced, “Look out, Grandpa! She’s backing up!” As children we hadn’t yet learned the rules of culture, and so phrases such as “That person’s fat!” and “What’s wrong with his face?” often emerged unexpectedly and at humorous moments. As we matured we gained certain filters for our language and thoughts—in truth, what we gained was discernment, which means that we developed the ability to choose which thoughts we would share, and which we would keep to ourselves, given our present circumstances and company.
As they hesitated on the threshold, casting long shadows, I hurried forward to greet them. At once I sensed something different about them. The girl was a gazelle, slender, small-boned, with large, dark eyes, and considerably shorter than her companion. She did all the speaking, accompanying her words with graceful gestures and appearing to anticipate perfectly his wishes. The boy was darker, his skin the colour of shadows cast on sand. He reminded me of an Arab nobleman, tall, with thin limbs and black hair, with something in his erect carriage that suggested otherworldliness.
It is Edward’s birthday today and he is eight years old.
So, this leads me to my sad news, I have made the tough decision to step down from my DT commitments at BITW... I never never thought I would do it, but Mum always said, if you can't do it properly, don't do it at all... and 4 Design Team spots is too many so tough decisions needed to be made. I have also read fellow scrapper's blogs who get too involved in scrapping and over commit only to burn out and quit the hobby altogether and I most certainly don't want that!!! I will definitely continue to stop by the blog, it is such an inspirational place to visit and I hope you do too.

It is reasonable to surmise that the military chiefs who decided to demolish the tuyilam illam were motivated less by the type of cultural logic that I have brought to the fore than the instrumental reasoning that is so pervasive in the modern era: namely, they did not wish the defeated LTTE to have any focal points for resurgence. That goal alone could have prompted such action – so that the cultural groundings that I have touched upon can be dismissed as esoteric nonsense by those readers attached to wholly instrumental thinking. In short, this line of destruction was pragmatic politics of the same type that inspired the government’s determination to ensure that no top-rung Tiger leader remained alive.[xviii]

There were lots of lovely things to sample, all for a small donation, to raise money for the Church Hall. Our timely impromptu visit meant that we were invited across to join them (the boyfriend being a fairly regular face around the area too...) Wow! Lots of lovely lovely things to try, and everything was homemade: pilau rice, chicken and beef dishes, bombay potatoes... and the puddings, including a 'Sweet Almond Slice', which was stopping eaters in their tracks, from a traditional Indian recipe, which I'm told was devine (I opted for the ice cream because I'm not much of a nut-eater). What a wonderful idea.
I wonder how many people of my generation or later have actually watched these men perform on the streets. Some more voices call me as I glance back. A high pitch sing-song voice of a fruit vendor “ jamun kale kale mujhse bhi zyada kale, kale kale re phalse thande meethe re phalse” ( black and juicy fruits, blacker than I am). These were the street sellers who brought delicious java plums and berries indigenous to this region. The salivary glands would immediately start working overtime thinking of the sweet and sour tangy taste of the fruits and we would run out to buy some in a leaf folded and sealed like a cone with a toothpick. Some other delights like the ripe jackfruit and tamarind along with star fruit were also sold by the vendors. Made into a spicy chaat sprinkled with spices the star fruit would make our mouths water.

Handling of the East Pakistan issue at the International level, too, was a fiasco on our part. Not that we did not mobilise any world opinion in our favour, we on the contrary rather alienated them mostly. On the other hand Indira undertook a whirlwind tour of 19 countries in October 1971 propagating the imaginary atrocities against the Bengalis and particularly the Hindus of East Pakistan and yet assuring each one of them that India had no intentions of aggression. Ironically, while she was convincing and canvassing the world powers, her army’s Eastern Command was giving the final touches to the Attack Plan in Fort William at the eastern bank of river Hoogli, Calcutta.
Now that I'm no longer a child, I can see that we are not yet a place where everybody is treated equally. Not everybody has an equal chance. Not everybody will treat you fairly.

Just as YouTube offers anybody the opportunity to be a movie director, 3D printing allows any individual to try their hand at industrial design. This – at least in theory – is a democratization of design. A finely designed object may be the result of thousands of edits and adaptations by users, from which many thousands of iterations and variations may result. A simple drinking cup, for example, might be manipulated countless times to suit the personal hand grip of each individual who prints it to physical form. Already, some manufacturers are using 3D printing to bring consumers into their internal design process at an earlier point. Dr Andy Palmer, Nissan’s head of global planning, told me that 3D printing allows Nissan to take a “creative chaos” approach to testing new designs on customers at an early stage in the design process. But mass-personalization will go farther yet: Google SketchUp has partnered with the 3D printing service i.Materialize to run competitions like “Pimp Your Vehicle” that ask users to print customisations for their bikes and cars. This is the future of not only the automobile industry, but of all others in a world where consumers have the power to personalize. 3D printing may deliver on the promise of punk.
The book is divided into three parts. The first part comprises of ‘Golf Balls’, ‘Saw Set’ and ‘The Watchmaker’s Wife’; the second contains only two stories, ‘Teeth’ and ‘Norwood Junction’ leaving only, ‘The Next Stop Is Croy’, to bring up the rear.
After all, if Jack and the Beanstalk can include a man-eating giant, why not a panto with the fearsome monster Grendel (especially once Beowulf has rendered him 'armless)? And one has to admit, as Grendel's mother, Angelina Jolie didn't offer the prospect of as many laughs (well, not intentional ones) as does a pantomime Dame (and this was a very good one - though how many Dames are lined up for a Wigmore Hall recital, I wonder?).

I raised my hand, to swallow the pills, then paused and shut my eyes for a moment. Fear consumed me. Fear was about to keep me alive, when I wanted to die the most. An agonizing pain travelled up my spine, and I suddenly knew what to do. I opened my eyes, ran to my window, and threw every single pill I’d owned. Then I froze, as I stared into space. Everything I wanted had become out of reach. Death had become out of reach, too.

My daughter Jackie described her experience of gravitating toward John on every social occasion, large or small, of her childhood and adolescence, because, she wrote, “he radiated calmness and balance and happiness”—ways of being that often seemed inaccessible to her, but that John, eyes closed, patting her knee, smiling, revealed and offered. Calum Chisholm—Sue and Kurt Heinzelman’s son—said early and eloquently this week what many have echoed since: “When John lost his vision, he taught us all how to see the world.” And moments after I heard what Calum had said, I was sharing some memories with John’s father Myles, a teacher himself, and remarked to him that John’s extraordinary place in so many hearts and so many lives was, in some measure at least, a tribute to how he had raised him. “I don’t know,” Myles said, “Sometimes I think John raised me.”

My main course was the cauliflower “steak”. I wasn’t really sure what to expect with this, and unfortunately the photo doesn’t do a good job of capturing the presentation, so I’ll try to explain. The “base” was about a quarter-inch thick and consisted of what I think was a roasted cauliflower, essentially smashed flat. The various garnishes were mostly other types of cauliflower, either whole florets, slices, etc. There were also raisins, toasted marcona almonds, and a “vandouvan vinaigrette”. Vandouvan is a sort of French/curry spice blend. Just as with the soup, these contrasting flavors — the spicy vandouvan sauce, the sweet raisins and the crunchy almonds — came together in different combinations so that hardly any two bites were the same. Delicious!

After efficiently introducing all the major characters, the film picks up narrative steam when one of the townsfolk is attacked by the aggressive parasites causing him a heart attack. The understandably concerned Eli investigates further and wouldn’t you know it, there’s something wrong with the feed supplied by Tender Meats. This puts him in direct conflict with Fletcher who tries to discredit the young vet at a town hall meeting. Once Eli and Jacob team up to kill a parasite let loose in the local hospital, Larva becomes an exciting buddy action movie of sorts as the latter supplies the firepower while the former supplies the brainpower. It is a lot of fun to watch these guys bounce off each other with Eli as the reluctant action hero and Jacob as the dry-witted tough guy. The hospital cat and mouse chase is nicely staged with plenty of suspense (thanks to moody cinematography), action and the requisite jolts as Eli and Jacob search the bowels of the building for the parasite, discovering a trail of bodies in its wake.

Anyway, enough of me blathering on about the heat. It seems our Indian summer has now come to an end, anyway, and normal service has been resumed. There's a definite chill in the air, and when I went out this morning I was even questioning whether a coat would have been preferable to a cardigan. So, in short, if my productivity levels don't pick up soon, I can no longer blame it on the hot weather. The signs so far are looking good. Look see, I've written this blog post and I've almost, almost finished one of the short stories too. I am feeling slightly more upbeat too. Hey, what's that coming over the horizon. Rain? Yippee!!! Because when you get rain, you might get one of these.
Look into it. I promise it is three years that will awaken your faith, refresh your soul, and prepare you to witness to the light of Christ.
Shutting Down Open Relay in Exchange 2010
I was inspired to put forth this challenge after reaching my 200th follower on Saturday and as I near my 200th post later this week. Not one for contests and the like, I thought it would be fun and helpful to celebrate with my fellow bloggers in some special way. We know that blogging can be fun and what fun we can have merrily blogging together with a common purpose--something where we can keep up with each other's work and share in a common experience. Any of you who participated in NaNoWriMo know what that can be like.
Been crafting at lunch breaks this week while at work.. Getting things ready for our trip to the beach in August. I can't wait..
Wonder Boy was truly mystified by my frantic "oh my god oh my god oh my god" reaction. There are a few things from my upbringing that are deeply ingrained, and behaving in church is one of them. You sit still, you don't refuse the Blood of Christ because it "tastes yucky," and you don't lie down on the floor in the middle of the service, even if (and I say this as an Episcopalian) you have been overcome by the Holy Spigot.
Think whatever you want. What you think about me does not define me, and at the end of the day I could care less that one person out there in the world thinks I'm bat-shit crazy. Because, admittedly, sometimes I am, but that's the way I like it. It keeps life interesting.
Celebrating the Mass Lesson-
But it was too late for surgeons to reattach
This last book of the Bible identifies itself as “the revelation of Jesus Christ,” and its author is designated “his servant John” who was exiled to the Greek island of Patmos because of his faith. Traditionally, John is identified with the author of the Fourth Gospel. Addressed to seven historical churches in Asia Minor, the Book of Revelation was written to warn against spiritual indifference and to elicit courage under persecution. Because of the extensive use of symbolism and picturesque imagery, its interpretation has posed many problems for the student of the Bible. While recognizing the historical situation (Roman persecution) that elicited this writing, many interpreters look upon it as a prophecy depicting events that were to take place at the end of the age. The ultimate victory of Christ is the dominant theme of this book.

The gruesome murder of Mongolian national Altantuya Shaariibuu by two bodyguards of then deputy prime minister Najib Razak (now prime minister!) is said to be related to the deal.
Oh, like, say Paul Allen and Richard Branson* two more players in the new space race:
after losing, i felt awful. more of crashed pride. i was trying to find the goodness in today’s failure. once the games ended, i was looking hard for explanations. i have lots to change not just with my skills but also with my ways. to win is to overpower my opponent. to face defeat is to overpower myself.

So, even though you have absolutely no idea what is in store for you when you venture into parenthood, you will most likely do ok.
A French “tian” is like a gratin, but it really refers to the clay baking dish. To make a Provencal eggplant tian, select some small to medium sized eggplant, onion (whatever color you find!) and tomatoes~
To serve the channa masala, you can use any bread of choice. I made pooris to go with the channa masala. You can also serve it with pita bread, naan or kulcha, something that we traditionally have channa with.

No, I’m kidding. It IS Oprah, but only in my best daydreams does Ms. Winfrey have my phone number. Actually, it’s a weekend festival of sorts to celebrate her magazine’s 10th anniversary. I’m an avid O reader and was willing to pay the shockingly high price for a Friday welcome reception, Saturday keynote by Oprah and “lifeshop” seminars with three of O magazine’s contributing writers, Saturday evening event with Oprah at Radio City Music Hall, and Sunday walk for charity.
Unfortunately, it's not only the UK who is consumed with this PC madness and Green hogwash. The disease has also spread to the USA and Australia who are both chomping at the bit to enforce another tax on the exhausted, over-taxed "working" families. If these Green whack-jobs have their way, we'll be back to lighting candles and fighting over food. Wow - hasn't our species sure evolved? In the meantime, China and India (with a population close to 3billion between them) laugh their heads off at us. I may just join them...haha.
We have much to be thankful for this year, and send warm Thanksgiving wishes to all.

I shouldn’t end this French-themed post without offering my warm congratulations to Carla Bruni, who has given birth to a healthy baby girl at the age of 43. May little Giulia have the looks of her mother and the stature of her father. I was disappointed that some newspapers described the new-born infant as “President Sarkozy’s daughter”, as if there was any need to emphasise the point. Ms Bruni may be whimsical and impulsive, but she wouldn't allow any oily-arsed non-entity to plant his sprouts in her allotment.

That almost surely was not the sentiment inside the museum. Perhaps not coincidentally, yesterday Crain's New York Business announced a "Business of Arts and Culture" breakfast April 30 on the topic "Dealing with controversy."
Our feelings are the gateway to what lies beyond our physical senses, and beyond our sense consciousness. Through our emotions, our feelings and our intuition, we are conscious of that which we cannot see. There is a direct link between our feelings and our aura – our feelings determine frequency of our vibration.
Seriously, you should go read the books.
Here's a montage of HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Jim Cramer, Michael Isakoff, F. Chuck Todd and Lanny Davis encountering conservatives in DC, and getting asked if these liberal "one percenters" will donate their food to the "99 percent" they claim to care about.

Something that always bothered me was, You're only 18,19,20,21 years old, you have plenty of time to have a baby. EH, WRONG! After suffering numerous miscarriages, that proof enough for me that we were on a limited time frame. Or another was, " At least you can get pregnant" What the heck kind of comment is that? At least I can get pregnant? So, you're telling me, well, it's a good thing I got pregnant to lose 5-6 pregnancies? These comments usually came from OTHER women who were having infertility issues. So, you'd think out of everybody these people would be the most sensitive to our situation. Just because we went on to have a healthy baby, doesn't mean that will happen again, or that we won't go on to lose another 5 pregnancies.

Do you notice that there is an underlying sense in that verse of “something happening”? We see the rough cloth bags bulging with seeds getting soaked by the rain, but there is also a sense of latency; by that we mean a sense of something that is not said, but is still there nonetheless. In this verse it is the underlying knowing that the soaked seeds are going to start swelling and sprouting in and through the holes in the weave of the cloth bag. That gives this hokku the feeling of a kind of potential power that is not actually mentioned in the verse. What is that power? It is the sense of the growing Yang energy of spring. I have talked about Yin and Yang in relation to hokku in other postings, and I will talk about them again in future postings, because they are something I often mention in my teaching of hokku. Keep in mind that we usually have that feeling of something left unsaid in hokku.
Political Correctness is Marxism with a nose job. Multiculturalism is not about tolerance or diversity, it is an anti-Western hate ideology designed to dismantle Western civilization. If we can demonstrate this, an important part of the battle has already been won.
Born on May 10, 1832, in Cork, Ireland, young William and his family fled the potato famine in 1846 and eventually found themselves in Peru. Grace became a successful merchant to the shipping and delivery vessels mining South America's natural resources, particularly bat guano, whose flexible chemical properties made it as desirable as precious metals.
Her improvement was brief, however. When she returned for a regular appointment with her doctor in Huntsville on July 18, her breathing, swallowing, and speaking had become seriously impaired. He said she needed to return immediately to her transplant doctors at Vanderbilt for more attention. At Vanderbilt, the doctors were still puzzled and concerned that she was worse, rather than improved. By this time she needed oxygen, and things were beginning to look quite serious. At almost the last minute, Becky’s travel to the dish convention had to be cancelled because she really had become unable to travel safely.
Another person who died under Weston’s care was Maxine Lee, 39, of Philadelphia. In November 2008, she was found dead in a house that Weston was renting in Norfolk, Va. Norfolk police said Lee died of natural causes. A medical examiner attributed Lee’s death to meningitis, with severe malnutrition as a contributing factor.

“I’ve got more hair on my chest Sonal has on her legs,” Kumar retorted. Sonal, an unfortunate eleven year old, had thick, black hair on her legs that her mother refused to let her shave. Sonal’s mother said god made her hair like that so she wouldn’t be tempted to wear anything “indecent.” This became a problem in the summer for Sonal, because, unfortunately, she also had a sweating problem.

The problem is that Republicans want Obama to move to the center/center-right, not because they actually care about passing policy, but instead because they want to confuse the electorate about who Barack Obama is politically, who his base is, and why would you vote for someone who has drifted around politically during his first term in an effort to appease whoever it was he needed to appease for a particular bill. The president would say that this illustrates the fact that he is not a president for liberals, or a president for conservatives, but instead a president of everyone in the Unites States. While that's definitionally true, is a little insincere, because the president knows better than anyone what it takes to win an election, and that is not necessarily being the president of everyone in the United States.
Running low on funds (as most gigolos) our Teddy Bare seeks the green pastures of a recently widowed barkeep, Freda, who is coarse, loud and heavily endowed financially. Freda (convincingly played by Brit powerhouse Margaret Lockwood) is no shrinking violet and takes the slick Mr. Bare on toe to toe. They marry with the new Missus thinking her husband has as much spinach as she herself. He soon realizes Freda is no soft touch and his eye turns to a new, attractive widow in town named Charlotte (Kay Walsh).
Life is a hurt
But I’m not sure it matters to me – as the article says, you need to write something that you care about, or it’ll be tough, and you’ll hate it, and even if you do finish it won’t end up with the kind of soul that you impart to something you love. I’m pretty sure I’ll only ever want to – or maybe even be able to – write science fiction. Where that will get me in future, who knows!
Always remembering Christ on the cross puts God as the number one priority in a person’s life. That simple spiritual labor on our part, combined with belief on the Son of God, another spiritual labor, causes the Holy Spirit to come upon us and work upon our hearts, softening them and creating the broken heart and contrite spirit, giving us sorrow for sin and the accompanying weeping, and allowing us to pray in the Spirit (see D&C 46:28-32.)

When paying for access, news sites, are very selective with who they hire and who writes what for the company. It is very popular these days and you can find out more by going to get a website that has an option called a pay wall that is they pay for access, because more and more newspapers are sending the tabloids out to the public online and this increases the chance of pay per access consumption.

I have decided to abandon my earliest preconceptions about how this blog should work (i.e. dedicated and more or less polished writing with a specific sort of audience/mindset paradigm).
This post is a bit of deviation from usual subjects I try to blog here about. but I think it is related to those other things, because perhaps it is some sort of summary of my contemplation on all those things and many other which I have been reading, watching, listening, discussing, thinking about and which go beyond simply politics or Media bias in Thailand, or even of fake global “flu pandemic”, or things which encompass all those things and view them from entirely other, higher perspective.
10 When the LORD your God brings you into the land he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, to give you—a land with large, flourishing cities you did not build, 11 houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant—then when you eat and are satisfied, 12 be careful that you do not forget the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.

The leaders of France, Britain, Italy, Germany, Canada, Japan and Russia will also join President Obama at Camp David. They are expected to discuss a follow up to the L’Aquila Food Security Initiative, created in 2009, following global food price spikes and riots in 2008 that caused concern about food availability in developing countries. Under the agreement, countries agreed to fund both food aid and agricultural development and infrastructure assistance for the poorest countries around the globe.

Hard one. I mean “concepts” are “concepts”, if you take the philosophical definition of what a concept is. So, sure, concepts are always relevant but, sure also the “copyright” jurisprudences and ways we’re applying them are varying a lot from a country to another so it’s quite hard to answer, but, again, I’d answer “yes and no”.
I’ve encountered a road block because I don’t have enough capital for my start-up costs.

Yes, it's been actual weeks since my last post. Believe me, I wish I'd had the time and inspiration to create some posts, but both of those things have been sadly absent from my life. And now I'm sick. Sort of. I mean, I'm not sure what's up. I'm blaming allergies, but basically it's a feeling of general-worn-outedness (more so than normal), banging hangover-like headaches, and the rawest, sorest throat ever. Of course all of this is coming on when I'm wildly busy at work and I've got actual social events on my calendar. Of course.

One of the most bizarre things I ever happened upon was at a Taco Bell Drive-thru. I dropped some of my change and when I looked down to see if it was worth salvaging ( not a penny, in other words), but what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a colossal, bubble-gum pink, rubber sex toy. Now, HOW did that happen? I doubt it just flew out of someone’s purse while they were digging for change and I truly hope nobody drives around, dangling one of those dreadful things out of the car window.
I don’t ‘need’ this extra $4,000 in credit. I have other ways I can pay for the contractor. But if I can’t get this sort of credit based on my financial history, then who can? I am assuming no one. Hence, we have a stagnant economy that won’t be moving anytime soon.

Spacial Delivery is a light-hearted romp of a science fiction novel - the equivalent of a beach read, with more brains, imagination and exotic settings.

*Shop at used curriculum sales and used book sales, such as the one at your library. Does your homeschooling support group host a book sale/swap every year? If not, why don't you start one? Find a free or inexpensive location, make renting a table cost effective, and get the word out. If you plan it, they will come. Book swaps usually work with a coupon method. You bring what you have and get coupons for the assessed amount and use those towards "purchasing" stuff you need. Your state convention may have a curriculum sale as part of their meeting once a year. Sell what you have there and use what you make to get what you need for next year.
I have learned that when I write from the gut I think it's most powerful and moving. What I've also learned is that even when my writing is dribble, there is some nugget of truth in about me and when you're part of a writing community they appreciate it because they get to know you a little better. They see past the yuck and mine it for the nugget. It makes it a safe place to "have a go" at this writing thing because as we know the only way to get better is to write. My favorite quote is below. It was under the heading, "Cope with Badness."

Now the new conservative government in Canada is insisting that they all obey the rules regarding tax exempt status; and they hate it saying; “The Conservatives are continuing their dishonourable attack meant to intimidate environmental groups, in a budget item that stands out for adding a needless new cost. Non-profit groups will be required to “provide more information on their political activities, including the extent to which these are funded by foreign sources,” budget documents say. And somehow the government has found $8-million, at a time of restraint, for the Canada Revenue Agency to spend on “education and compliance,” $3-million of which is for extra audits to ensure the existing 10-per-cent rule is maintained (no more than 10 per cent of funds can be spent on advocacy).

It will be better to try and clear through the unresolved memory or feeling in yourself before playing it out with somebody else. 2012 emotions are very heightened, as we are each moving fast through multiple timelines in ourselves, yet rarely at the same place as each other at the same time. Clashes can easily occur because everyone is feeling more passionately, yet we are all also more in our own worlds and personal timelines than ever before. So trying to replay the past with other people, in order to seek resolution, can spectacularly backfire on you in times like these.

Finally, it was nice to see a pair of middle distance runners step up into the mix. First was Shannon Rowbury who, though third in Berlin, hasn’t had the most exciting of seasons so far. Today she stepped up and took a close third in the 1500 in a seasons best 4:05.73. A very good effort for her and with 3 weeks to go potentially a sign that she may yet give the big girls a strong run in Daegu. The athlete that really got my heart pumping, however, was Leo Manzano. Manzano was third in London last year with a PR 3:50.64 in the mile, today he ran the mile again – and upgraded to first place in 3:51.24 – very close to his PR. What was exciting was the manner in which he won, and who he beat for the victory. Because after staying competitive throughout most of the race, Manzano outran Bernard Lagat (USA) and Augustine Choge (KEN) – two well established milers with strong kicks of their own. Manzano looked strong and unafraid as he sailed down the finishing straight – and looked ready to compete well at Worlds. It was certainly nice to see someone other than Lagat look ready to perform over 1500 meters – especially since Lagat will only be contesting the 5000 in Korea.
Being a small business owner is the greatest joy and the greatest challenge. I know that whatever my business accomplishes, it will be a direct result of the effort I have put into it. It’s a great feeling. On the other hand, I’ve never worked harder in my life. I have to be aware of everything: sales, products, trends, advertising, online marketing, accounting, reporting, licensing, banking, maintenance, purchasing, cooking, cleaning and on and on. To succeed, you need to know where to spend your time concentrating on what’s at hand while keeping an eye on everything else. Time management is critical. I often tell people that I wish there was just a few more hours in a day to get done what needs to get done. And, do you know what helps? PLANNING.

"Every now and again, as I wander about town, my mind drifts from Mussolini and Fascism, the subject in hand, to another matter: Tony Blair and New Labour. Odd, but I cannot help noticing that Blair and Mussolini have rather a lot in common. I am not saying that Blair has consciously copied Mussolini. But Blair, probably without even realising it, does seem to have imbibed quite a few things from the Duce. ... For a start, Blair extols the virtues of the Third Way, which was the phrase coined by the Fascists, no less, to describe their alternative to capitalism and communism..... Indeed, despite all the uncanny similarities between the two leaders, there are, of course many differences, not the least of which is that Blair is in many ways more right-wing. Mussolini, for example, founded Italy's welfare state. Presumably, most people would agree that such a move was fairly left-wing. Blair, on the other hand, is doing his best not just to hack away at the welfare state but also at workplace rights"

To make antennea, cut a black pipe cleaner in half. Cut a length of black yarn and tie and knot it around the center of a piece of black pipe cleaner a few times. This will create a little ball at the tip of the antennea. Bend the pipe cleaner in half and insert the ends into the bee's head between Rnds 5 and 6. Leave about 1"-1.5" of the antennea sticking out of the bee's head. With the pipe cleaner that is inside the bee's body, bend the two pieces at a 90 degree angle to anchor the antennea in place. For added strength, you may want to stitch the pipe cleaner "tails" to the bee's body using a length of yellow yarn. Repeat with other half of the pipe cleaner for the other antennea.

That's not to say that good writers don't emerge from these courses - loads do, but I suspect that they would have been good writers anyway, and I don't think they're any better than the writers of previous generations who didn't have the benefits of CW courses. When I was little and I asked my parents how you got to be a writer they would have told me that I'd need an idea, a pen and a notebook, and that's what I try to tell children who ask me that question now. I don't want them getting the notion that you have to go to college and do an M.A before you can be a writer! It's also interesting that Creative Writing courses seem to be multiplying just at a time when it's becoming increasingly difficult to actually earn any money from writing. Perhaps that's the only way that authors will be able to make a living in future; by teaching Creative Writing to other would-be Creative Writing teachers...
Yesterday, we went out for another hack. Nothing too much. I think it topped out at like 3-4 miles. We trotted some good lengths in the fields and did one nice controlled canter. Mostly walking enjoying the 81* weather. That's right 81*!!!! I can only hope and pray that the weather stays nice. **fingers crossed**
But I have to believe as our professor, Kate Milberry, assured us today, there will be a plateau in that learning curve. We will find ourselves more capable of focusing on what we’re putting out there to build our personal and professional online personas, moving from Shirky’s worry of too much focus on the technical to an emphasis on engaging our connections through these mediums.

. . . he is beginning to develop a sense of direction. he's aware of our surroundings and knows exactly where we are at any given point. we pull out of our house and he immediately points to the "mail" (mailbox) and the "ducks". as we approach the big girl school at pick-up time, he yells "syd-syd!". when we pass one of our favorite shopping centers, he starts calling "burg-er" and "froot" and "mail" because that's where only burger and tutti frutti and the post office are located.

Design is most obviously complicated in the case of an illustrated book. It's not just a case of picking the right illustrator or choosing the right photos. Pick up an illustrated book. Ignore the content of the pictures. What has the designer done? You need to look at where the pictures are on the pages, what size they are, how they relate to the text. Do they bleed off the edge of the page or are they surrounded by white space? Is text integrated into the pictures? Does it flow around them with a curved or jagged line, or is everything in rectangular blocks? How is white space used in and around the pictures?

But don’t go shaking sticks at garden birds; that would be silly. I don’t care if it makes me horrifically nerdy, I think birds are fascinating. Don’t tell my housemates.
A lot of you have asked me about my change in eating and cooking habits. I've really enjoyed this new way of eating. The thing that has helped me the most is that my husband and my kids are all on board. It takes a lot of planning and making sure that the fridge is stocked, but it's well worth it.

I'm going to auction this hook off and end the bidding on Friday the 20th just to add a little more superstition in the mix (did you know that Friday, January 20 is a magical day?) Me either. heh So cast aside your doubts, conjure up your bid and send it to me, not by owl (way too slow for out of country bidders), but via the e-magical way at jimbocrochetwhittler@yahoo.com , and letting me know your bid. I'll post bids as they come in and run the auction until Magic Friday at the wizardly hour of 10pm Pacific Time. Please bid in $5 increments. Ties will be broken by the time the bids are received. The first bid received in a tie wins.

The report makes one other reference to copyright: at the end of the chapter on Australian content, it refers to submissions it received regarding support for independent producers including ‘statutory licensing arrangements to encourage the exploitation of back catalogue’. This proposal would seem to be connected with current considerations of ‘orphan works’ (works whose rightsholders cannot be identified and/or located), and solutions to enable the use of those works. Following research commissioned by Screenrights, the University of Technology Sydney is launching a white paper on this issue on 3 May. Research on orphan works is also being carried out by the University of New South Wales, with support from the Copyright Agency Cultural Fund.

If you are into such things, the Trauma: Life in the ER website has an ER simulation game where you can pretend to be a doctor. I haven't played it yet, but it looks fun.

I was born and raised in America but have lived in Europe for over a decade. I studied Creative Writing at Vanderbilt University before acquiring a variety of professional experiences including creating marketing campaigns (web, print and radio), web design work, working in bookshops and a lot of editorial freelance work. My freelance work included proofreading, sub-editing, copywriting, acting as production editor, acting as commissioning editor, and writing articles and book reviews for various online and print publications.

On Dec. 12, Occupy protesters on the West Coast held a day to “shut down Wall Street on the waterfront,” resulting in the partial closure of several ports. In the two weeks before the protests, there were six InterOccupy conference calls in which representatives from 25 occupations planned the day of action, according to Joan Donovan, an InterOccupy organizer and Occupy Los Angeles participant. Those calls covered everything from coordination of the timing of protests up and down the coast to lessons learned from Oakland organizers from a previous port demonstration to strategies to minimize arrests, she said.
The terms proposed for a referendum look like a hopeless and confused committee-created fudge. A referendum on the terms proposed is likely to achieve only one thing, namely to kick the issue into the long grass for the foreseeable future. Only a straight in/out question is appropriate.
Yes, I had a super bad perm, and I look pretty dorky, but I still love this picture. I love my beautiful friends, and my shoes, and the attitude I had that night. I was going to have fun, no matter what. And I did. I had an awesome time. I danced until the dj packed up his gear. Two guys that seemed far out of my league danced with me because they liked my shoes. When a couple of people verbally harassed me (yes, I was insulted and bullied at every high school event) I laughed at them. I couldn't believe they thought they could hurt my joy.

There were 18 appearances in all, the final one occurring on the feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel, July 16. Although Bernadette’s initial reports provoked skepticism, her daily visions of “the Lady” brought great crowds of the curious. The Lady, Bernadette explained, had instructed her to have a chapel built on the spot of the visions. There the people were to come to wash in and drink of the water of the spring that had welled up from the very spot where Bernadette had been instructed to dig.

Unfortunately, mass casualty incidents have become more and more frequent both worldwide and here in the U.S. A mass casualty incident takes on several names with suicide bombing, active shooter, and multi-prong attacks being the most common. The primary goal of all of these incidents is the same: kill and maim as many people as possible while maximizing fear and chaos.
When the California Supreme Court approved same-sex marriage on May 15, 2008, Jackie and Jessica just knew, as soon as they heard, that they would marry. At the wedding, Jackie wore black and she smiled in a way that seemed simultaneously bright and distant; Jessica, who had been stressed for weeks about the wedding, held her face very still, as if afraid that the wrong emotion would slip out. The ceremony was conducted by their close friends Laura and Peter, who is Ezra’s biological father and someone Jackie and Jessica consider to be a member of the family.
Along the road today we saw eagles, horses, lots of abandoned dead cars and even one crashed up caravan. I think we hit a poor little finch but dodged a number of lizards. We met a lovely guy called Frank who is also a biker. He rides up to 1000kms a day and is on his way home to Darwin. We have mostly kept to ourselves on this trip, but occasionally you meet someone on the way and you start talking. Turns out Frank is also a trumpet player and, like Jeremy, has played in many brass bands and other ensembles. He very kindly gave us his petrol can complete with bungies so we don't run out of fuel on our way back through Coober Pedy. We met up with him again this evening at Erldunda and had dinner together. The photo at the picnic table is of Jeremy and Frank and our lovely gift of the red petrol can!
Two things strike me here. I hope that 17 inch screen is made from some very heavily reinforced glass because it looks eminently breakable.

At the entrance to the wood, there was a singing Marsh Tit and a pair were further into the wood. I did hear a Willow Tit calling from that end of the wood, but I didn’t have time to wait for them to reach me. Good views of Treecreeper were some compensation – they’re everywhere just now.
Plus – did I mention this? – there’s free wireless. So all the die-hard worker bees in the family can troop inside or join the laptoppers sitting on the lawn outside hoping to grab a signal … while the rest of us ante up our $10 non-Massachusetts resident fee, and start trolling through the books.
If the placenta does get ruined you can also plant it under a tree or bush. If chemicals or alcohol is used on the placenta, or it sits out for longer than a few hours, it really should not be consumed. There are deer and sheep placenta pills out there that you can buy online, so those are an option if you feel like you really need something.

1. Carpool, walk, or ride the bus to school or work. If you live within a couple of blocks from school or work, there’s no reason why you should be driving or riding there. You’re inside over eight hours a day, so why not enjoy the morning and afternoon walks as a way to prepare/ decompress for the day? If you live further away, it’s more eco-friendly to hitch a ride with friends or to take the big yellow school bus. You wouldn’t want to deprive your kids of school bus memories, would you? Plus, it might make your afternoons a bit less stressful.

This stretch for the Sixers should be a good one despite having to start on the road.

Another note about the event was that instead of being jam-packed with college youths trying to get drunk, there were tons of locals and beer-lovers out an about. The Man and I generally run into a lot of people we know, but this was wall-to-wall locals. The event staff allowed designated drivers to pay the garden entry fee and get a DD bracelet so they could hang out with (and watch over) their friends. Plus it was Kanapaha for the love of god.

A series of rhyming poems, Nothing Beats a Pizza opens with an ode to the pie: “Nothing beats a pizza when you’re in a pizza mood because a pizza isn’t anything like any other food….” The book skips, jumps and dances through other pizza poems, landing on topics that range from substitute teachers to the clean dog boogie, the entire endeavour feeling like you’ve wandered into a crazy, creative chef’s kitchen where anything goes and experimentation is welcomed.

Bergün (km 40.3, shortly after Funtanislas), is considered to be the beginning of the hardest part of the race. It's the start of a climb to the Kesch-Hütte, from 1282 m ASL (Funtanislas) up to 2632 m ASL (Kesch-Hütte). That's 1350 m straight up! And it was unbelievable. I never experienced something like this. I counted every 100 m on my altimeter, expected my legs to quit any second because the path was so steep. Nobody runs here, not even the winners of this race.

Assign chores, share your knowlege on how to cook and clean, build birdhouses, and ride bikes or go on hikes together. This is so much more valuable (and cheaper) than buying textbooks or paying for classes. You can't beat a REAL education. In college, you could always tell which professors had actually gone out there and done what they taught from those who went straight from being a student to being a teacher. Experience can't be beat.

The alert goes out from a taxi driver or a street vendor, equipped with a high-end handheld radio and paid to work as a lookout known as a “halcon,” or hawk.The radio signal travels deep into the arid countryside, hours by foot from the nearest road. There, the 8-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) dark-green branches of the rockrose bush conceal a radio tower painted to match. A cable buried in the dirt draws power from a solar panel. A signal-boosting repeater relays the message along a network of powerful antennas and other repeaters that stretch hundreds of miles (kilometers) across Mexico, a shadow communications system allowing the cartel to coordinate drug deliveries, kidnapping, extortion and other crimes with the immediacy and precision of a modern military or law-enforcement agency.

The Liberal Democrat Friends of Palestine regret the resignation of the party whip by Baroness Tonge and offer her their full support. Her resignation follows condemnation of her by the party leadership for remarks she made in a meeting at Middlesex University last week. The condemnation was made before the leadership had heard her side of the story or even spoken to her. That action in itself worries us. She is entitled to an apology.

The day before, Jessica and I kept getting into trouble because we kept talking to each other when we weren’t supposed to. An announcement would come over the loudspeaker. “Bob and Jessica, please stop talking to each other during the commercial breaks”. Finally, some big Amazon lady with a headset opened the door to our booth and screamed, “Stop talking, or I am going to come in there and kick your fucking asses”!!! I was like, “Oooops”. We stopped talking to each other. I was scared of that lady. I had seem her running around like a lunatic all day long, yelling at people.

My favourite actors to work with would be a tie between ‘Chase’, where I worked with Cole Hauser, Amaury Nalasco and Kelli Giddish or ‘Freelancers’ where I worked with Forest Whitaker, 50 Cent, Malcolm Goodwin, Matt Gerald, Ryan O’Nan and Robert Wisdom. Both scenes were intense, I learned so much from all the actors and was able to be creative. I was commended by star actors and directors on my acting abilities. To get props from stars and successful directors, makes me that much more confident as an actor.

Last weekend we went to a Christmas-do with friends and I wanted to create a fun chocolate cake that also looks festive so it was time to get the gold dust out. Just brush it on the before you place the Maltesers on the cake as you will need to apply some pressure and they would otherwise move around in the soft butter cream. Maltesers are great for this as they look like little Christmas baubles and their malty taste goes nicely with the spices and the rum but even chocolate covered hazelnuts or such could work well.

At the root of Hungary’s sluggish growth and extreme political remedies is the lowest employment rate in the region – barely one in two of those of working age - and an exceptionally high tax wedge on labour, second only to Belgium’s within the OECD in recent years. By 2006 Hungary had Swedish/French levels of public spending at Polish levels of per capita income. When coupled with a post-2007 crisis in privately held foreign debt the former Socialist government was left with nowhere to go but to unprecedented economic retrenchment: something they were no longer trusted to manage after revelations they had already lied about the real condition of Hungary’s public finances back in 2006 in order to win that election, and subsequent corruption scandals. Enter Fidesz and Viktor Orban in a coalition with the Hungarian Christian Democrats, with a constitutional supermajority and the temptation, given the unrewarding economic situation, to embark on the most almighty recasting of the rules of the Hungarian political game: what has ensued is a bacchanalia of populist-nationalist elite self-indulgence and hatred-mongering that has taken Hungary’s international reputation from a regional reform leader to pariah status in two years, and its political economy deeper into the mire.

While this restructuring is random at first, it will immediately give you ideas as to which order of ideas in your writing is better than others. It’s hard to just look at an outline and decide what the best structure should be. Shuffling is a more hands-on approach that allows you to find the best structure through process of elimination and inductive reasoning.

Shortly after I started teaching there, he came into my classroom one day to watch me teach. After the students left, he came up to me, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, "You know, when you first came to me looking for a job, my first thought was to throw you out on your ass. But I believe in second chances, and you know I always believed in you. I always knew one day you'd find yourself and figure out where you belong. And watching you up there today, I know now that the front of a classroom is exactly where you belong."

It disturbes me when I read articles like this. Especially when it happens in my home city. It took eight minutes for a couple of guys to break into a house, severely injure three men, and paint the house in blood. It happened in the middle of the night as they were sleeping, which will no doubt scar this guys for the rest of their lives. I often get teased for constantly locking my door as my friends tell me “relax, it’s Canada.” But in my defence I point to incidents like this where a locked door was no deterent to these men with a goal. In the end I’m sure the suspects and victims knew each other and most likely owed money and drugs that they were after. The scary thing is they didn’t catch all of them. Now there’s no reason to go rush out and call Alarm Force and deck out your home with the latest home security gadgets. Police say it was a targeted event, as most are, which is why I make sure I’m never targeted in the first place.

I'm looking forward to the opportunity to share some true bargain hunting experiences. I am also determined to re-finish a piece of furniture....something that is definitely out of my comfort zone, but I figure with enough research I might be able to pull it off. For now, I am super pleased with where we are at....and at the same time I am also working on my patience and enjoying the time we have left in our little bachelor(ette).
I was recently approached by Princess Katie and Rocket Steve, who are a rock band for kids. They were looking to reinvent the current cartoon characters of themselves, they use on all their CDs, website, videos and promotional materials. Looking to appeal to a broader children’s market, they wanted their current characters redone with a cuter, younger look. They approached several artists to contribute a sketch of their vision of the new characters. The posted sketch is my contribution to the mix. They are currently still deciding which artist’s solution will work best for their needs.
The official genre label for Thamud is ambient black metal and the music stays along that path with the exception of the last track on the demo, Lost Within Mists Of Time. The last track borders on a classical composition, but stays in-tune with the general feel of the entire demo. It's hard to put into words, but what I sense from this project is eerie melancholy. “Lost Within Mists OF Time” is the star of this demo, it bleeds emotion in the rawest sense and transports me to a snow laden Lincoln Park (Jersey City, NJ – look it up, it's a dismal place on it's best day) sitting on a bench overlooking the polluted man-made lake. I used to go there to escape the chaos of family life and just reflected on things. That time of my life is what this track brings back to me. It is very rare when a song that I have no history with brings nostalgia of that kind.
I sent off 6 different 6x6 papers and received some in return. I used 4 of the papers for my layout. I was inspired by the patchwork look of Scout's skirt and mixed a bunch of patterns together.

Over on the Sepia Saturday Blog, the theme this week is 'Workers'. Here are three postcards from my collection that show workers posing for photographs, all are from the UK and date approximately from the time of the first World War. None of these postcards are identified as to location, subjects or dates. Postcards like this can be picked up for next to nothing on eBay or at postcard fairs. If the factory or identity of one or more of the sitters can be established, values can go very high indeed.

Insensitivity of tourists toward the environment and nature is also responsible for the degradation of Ladakh. Air pollution caused due to increased number of vehicle, and enhancement in tourism related activities is disturbing the peace and serenity of Ladakh. The freshness of the air and the untouched beauty of the valley has been replaced by diesel fume and streets littered with plastic wrappers.
By now, everyone around the table is familiar with dungeons and dragons, role-playing, and the basics of monsters, traps, and the game in general. Half the players had 3e experience. Most of the players have been around the dungeon block a time or two, so to speak, so these factors all combined to allow us to really get the most out of the adventure: savoring the role play, knowing the trap is about to fire, but going forward anyway, diving into the black black water to retrieve the glowing pile of loot – and even doffing armor beforehand. Rope, who doesn’t have fifty feet? Listening, searching, poking ,prodding, it was dungeons and dragons spelunking at its most basic, just like the box advertised. We blew through it and enjoyed every moment.
Your mission statement should be the reflection of these statements.

Once I got home, I got some more work done and Heather wanted to leave to get some dinner. So, we left and went to “Taco Bell” and “KFC” and made some quick stops and then came home and ate some food while the kids ate leftovers from last night. After dinner, I continued to work on putting up miniatures on Ebay while I watched my usual Sunday night shows including “Amazing Race”, “The Good Wife”, and “CSI: Miami” and had all the rest of my miniatures (minus some doubles) on Ebay by the end of the night. I hope I get some good bids because I plan on using some of the money toward some costuming projects as well as some Star Wars minis. After that, i went to bed.

My list was shaped in consideration of our guest, who is not a big fan of highly hopped ales and has only reached legal drinking age 14 months ago. I wanted to keep the ABV in a reasonable range.
During the holidays, the space between grows even wider for people like me (read: people with abnormally high expectations of themselves.) In my own mind, I'm supposed to host parties, make homemade food, have enough funds to buy each family member and friend the perfect thoughtful-yet-unexpected-present-that-each-person-was-missing-from-their-lives-yet-didn't-think-to-ask-for, make quality time for my loved ones (not just buy them perfect presents, that's shallow), and constantly express the Christmas Spirit while others are driving me crazy with a lack of their own. The natural sadness that comes during the holidays is to be shoved down and carols are to be sung even louder, otherwise I'm a Grinch.
The Mail called it a 'sickening' attack following a simple request; that it was made worse by the post-assault celebrations; and highlighted that the thugs only received suspended sentences for stamping on someone's head. They were correct to be angry on all three counts.

Captain America came in, and popped in a Civil War DVD, and watched a few minutes of it while I read. Andrea texted again at around 10pm, and said that I could come over now for the hair party. Sigh. It was SO late, and I was tired, and hadn't blogged yet, but I just couldn't resist. I hadn't seen Andrea in over 24 hours, and that's just not right - ROFL! So I drug my tired butt down to her house.
Ministers say the changes are vital to help the NHS cope with the demands of an increasingly ageing population of feckless MPs and Lords, the rocketing costs of new drugs and treatments for their unhealthy lives of luxury, the impact of other lifestyle factors, such as obesity from drinking too much champagne and eating too much rich food and the demands of an increasingly greedy generation of politicians who all want to make as much as they can by privatising everything in sight.
Welcome Monday!!! I had to say it with a little enthusiasm because I feel like I am dragging today, I think it's the weather, It is hot, hot hot, than cold, cold , cold! Is is Spring? Summer? Who knows?
The Buddhas were visible as I stepped off the airplane but I was so distracted by the cool, crisp, FRESH, air that I barely even noticed. The scenery all over was spectacular but I'll get into that later. When we got to the Buddhas, we had to mosey around for a bit to try and find the ticket/entry point. As non-locals, we paid 12 USD to enter the site thought it supposedly bought us admission to another site in the region. The Buddhas are a UNESCO World Heritage Site so I did expect to see a bit more activity but aside from the two employees taking our money, we were the only ones.
I'm still working away on the Alphabet Cards. I'm very very close, but still have a lot to do. In other news, I was hoping to do a kickstarter for the cards, but was sadly rejected with no reason. It's not the end of the world, but I was hoping for some help making the cards an affordable price.

After watching many of my blogging friends travel to meet their Compassion International sponsor child, I felt God working in my heart to join this worthy cause. At first I didn't think I had the money, but then I realized that cable TV cost more than my sponsorship would. After this realization I knew what God wanted from me! God made it very clear to me that I was to go online and sponsor a child...and I did just that!

Denmark recently instituted a "fat tax", but unfortunately the government decided to tax butter and cheese and other fatty foods, rather than pasta or sweet drinks, so the tax will make Danes less healthy.

I hope by now, it is clear to all that I have a bit of a one track mind currently. I’m calling it premature senioritis. I mean, it isn’t even all that premature either-December 2012!

The flowers are in a clear, crisp-edged, lucite container (actually a wine cooler, but it does double duty as a vase). The peacock plumes are in vintage Fostoria "American" footed vases. The pattern was intoduced in 1915, but I think of it as a modern design, with its sparkling, cubist motif.

The salmon began to smoke slightly, so I took them off the heat, and left them on the pan to cook the very center through to “well” done (even though its not necessary), and all that was left was the rice. The cook time for the rice was estimated at about 15 minutes, but it really took about 30 mins – which was fine because the cookies came ready just before the rice! I got the cookies cooling on a rack and scooped up some rice, a salmon fillet and some snap peas to take my “food porn” shot for this blog entry! Mei, Patella and I headed into the living room to eat our delicious dinner while watching the last half of “The Accidental Husband” – which was a great movie! Really, Patella had a greenie treat, since she only gets kibble for “dinner”… she did not share my salmon with me…although she would have loved it!
This initiative, started by two women on Feb. 19 with a Facebook page titled, “Organizing Against the War on Women,” has caught fire with angry women all over the country. The response was immediate. By the next morning, almost 500 women had asked to join and organize for April 28 in their states. As of April 15, the group has 21,300 members and organizing centers in all 50 states.

Some things have changed since I wrote last. That evening I talked to my sister and she agreed to go with me to the park when I meet up with Jermaine. Actually, she and her boyfriend are going to come along (she kind of invited him, but that's okay). As soon as I had that arranged, I felt a little better. I felt like I would have someone to talk to (so I wouldn't have to make small talk with him) and I felt like it would be a better situation, overall.
And all this has me thinking: what happened? I am not competitive. I don't compare myself to others. I feel good about others' achievements. I like not standing out. RIGHT?
This is how I see opposition to the Occupation in philosophical terms. I have to say that when I read in the Jewish Peace News, or in reports from Bat Shalom, or Gush Shalom or elsewhere, of Israeli activists non-violently protesting the Wall alongside Palestinians, or monitoring checkpoints, of Israeli refuseniks, or, going much further back, of Women in Black standing vigil for years, of American Jews demonstrating against the Occupation in city after city, when I watched the video of the Jewish Voice for Peace’s recent dignified and well-choreographed demonstration at Caterpillar, I feel emotionally strengthened in hope and resolve. I think this kind of activity—demonstrating, publishing a newsletter, writing, speaking, crossing lines to meet and stand with others in resistance—carries its message further out than we can know, including to other Jews who have been looking away or afraid to speak out. At this time, when so much hope seems to have disappeared down a political suckhole in the demonic collusion of our own rightwing government with that of Israel, we need to remember that.
i'm sitting here thinking about the bed that is covered in stuff that needs to be packed in a bag and i can't believe that it's almost time for us to leave! it feels like just a few short weeks ago that the Lord placed this calling in front of us and we said yes. God has already shown and taught me so many things through out the preparation process! Number one, He has shown me that i WILL find Him when i seek Him. when i truly seek Him and His face and not only His hand, He reveals Himself to me. i have had so many questions throughout this process and so many hesitations and worries and obstacles, but God has proven faithful through every single one and has shown me what He can do with my life when i am willing to just submit to Him.
About six months ago Bob and I had a long discussion about Apps. We even discussed creating Series Apps or a WDWPUB App with a development company. I, being the techno geek that I am, took a few webinars on App Development. Where I saw an App would be beneficial for our company would be in the Area 51 series BUT not as a book App, but as a game App! Oh yeah. Mike Turcotte roaming around in a bouncer, defeating the bad aliens. I’d play with that App. I also think Bob would have some really cool, neato ideas (I lost Bob the moment I said neato) for this kind of game. I mean, he was a Green Beret after all and is grandfather to the future leader of the resistance…
Words that pop out in the definition of hope are words like expect, confidence, and belief. God wants our hope and our faith. He wants them because He knows that we are all tired of being let down and disappointed. That’s why we are told to place our hope, our faith, our confidence, and our belief in Him……because He is unfailing in love, grace, mercy, compassion, comfort, and forgiveness. God is unfailing.

I had now reached the culmination of nearly a decade of personal study and research, planning, wondering, anticipating, and finally participating and doing the work of this path of plants, the ancient Way of Ayahuasca. I had traveled this road to learn more about the nature and history of the religious impulse in mankind, and also to personally experience that oldest form of religion – shamanism. I did this to see for myself what I could make of the claims of spiritual dimensions and non-human beings, visions and tests, and gifts and healings from a universe other than the one we live in day to day. Mankind is a talented creator of things real and of things of fiction. Are all the stories of magical things, spirits and sprites, demons and angels, paradises and fearful hells, miraculous healings, aliens from other worlds, possessions and inspirations, and all the myth of our species – is all this fiction? Is there any part of this that can be said to be real?

When Marvel started talking about a unified movie universe I wasn’t sure they would be able to pull it off, turns out I was very wrong. Likewise I had some initial doubts about Whedon as director, handling such a large budget, cast and action packed film seemed a little different to his usual work. I am sorry Joss Whedon, I could not have been more wrong if I had tried.

While waiting for the Easter Egg Hunt contest to kick start at 3:00pm, I got Kit boy to go for the simple 'Make Your Own Keychain Workshop' whereby he was asked to choose a picture of his favourite cartoon character and colour it. Once completed, I helped Kit boy to hand it over to their so called 'Shrink Art Station' for processing. You must be wondering why 'shrink art' instead of something 'keychain' since these kids are making keychains.... well, I was wondering too at that point in time but after seeing what they (the staff) did, now I know.

We've been asked when we're going to have more kids. We had originally planned on trying after Lucas' first birthday, but we're not ready. Now that I have this level of happiness I want to really enjoy Lucas while he's little. My next pregnancy will be high risk, full of anxiety again and I won't be able to do much with little dude because my max weight limit to lift is 15lbs and he's above that (thank goodness) and constantly growing. So for now, we have no plans on trying for the next year or two. We are okay with a surprise pregnancy, but we won't be trying.

Avid fans will remember it as belonging on the bookshelf with her other novels like ‘The Choir’ (Joanna’s first contemporary novel), ‘Men and the Girls’, ‘Friday Nights’, ‘The Other Family’ and of course ‘The Rector’s Wife.’ She’ll be autographing copies when she visits Sri Lanka for the first time to attend the 2012 Galle Literary Festival, an event which she describes as “a treat in itself.” While she’s here, Joanna also intends to be involved in some of the festival’s outreach programs: “The young are of course the future of any country, so it will be a privilege as well as fascinating to learn something of what children and the under 25’s in Sri Lanka think and hope for – and I’m afraid that once a teacher (I taught for twenty years in the UK, long ago…) always a teacher, in some sense! So that will be a wonderful add-on to the literary aspect of the visit.”

There has been a theory floating around for about the last forty years or so, mostly in Al Davis’ mind, that you can take Olympic-grade sprinters and turn them into wide receivers. I can see the logic behind it. Theoretically, they could beat any coverage, or become a dangerous kick returner. What it doesn’t account for though, is that receivers have to run precise routes and catch the ball. So much of the passing game is based on timing and precision, and just putting someone in whose main attribute is being lightning-fast isn’t enough.

My son Jack was working but that didn't stop a Mother's Day visit from his family. My daughter-in-law Stephanie and their kiddos came over and brought me this beautiful planter and plants to go in it..potting soil too! Here's Steph and our oldest Granddaughter Driana planting it for me. Thank you so much! It looks great on the deck. Jack called later to wish me a happy day and that made it all perfect!

Once, I was lost for half an hr. in the Apex ski resort area after Jack trooped off further to explore a trail. I thought I could easily return back to the hotel. Within 40 min. of snowshoeing solo, I faced virgin snowy fields ringed by mountains. If it weren’t for the unseen whine of snowmobile machines, I would have been unable to flag someone later for simple directions. Meanwhile Jack had already arrived at the hotel downhill and headed back onto the trail at sunset when he realized I had not returned yet.

One year I asked if he’d feed my cat while I was away. He didn’t want to do it but he grudgingly agreed, on one condition: he’d feed her outside only. “Animals don’t belong in the house,” he said. When I returned a few weeks later, I spied food and water bowls on his living room floor and my cat sleeping under a chair in the corner. “What’s up with the cat in the house?” I asked. “She’s my little friend,” he said, giving her a squeeze.

It is also Eastern Orthodox Easter (more commonly called “Pascha”). Thus anticipating the Risen Christ while seeing someone approaching their death is a bit jarring. Yet, if Holy Week is a time to prepare the soul, what better reminder of my own fallen state and humanity than being with someone who is preparing theirs. It’s such an odd, but needed, juxtaposition of circumstances.

The best news that the Mets received this offseason was twofold: the end of the Bernie Madoff/Wilpon family fiasco and the return of Johan Santana after nearly a year and a half on the shelf. And maybe the promise of David Wright regaining some of his power now that the club has moved in the fences at Citi Field. But aside from those matters, this is still a franchise in dire straits.

Apart from the militia entrusted with the maintenance of public order, the Soviet State keeps up a political and criminal police (the Opgu), and a permanent army. The Ogpu has the right of life and death over all citizens; it has the power to prosecute, arrest, and imprison any individual of whom the Secretariat of the Party wishes to be rid; it may judge him without witnesses, condemn him without proof, sentence him to lifelong exile, and banish him for ever from the face of the earth. There is no other example in bourgeois society of a police system with such extensive and complete authority; it might be termed the most “perfect” inquisitorial organization in the world’s history. At its command there is a close network of public and secret agents, paid officials, and willing informers, together with certain military forces which are directly under its orders and tactfully termed “special duty” or “vone” detachments. Its actual budget is unknown as it is maintained to a great extent with grants from secret funds, but in 1926 these were admitted to amount to 27,122,778 rubles (£904,000), besides 36,825,000 rubles (£1,227,500), which was the cost of the special military detachments (The “Finansovaya Gazette“, May 9th 1926). The Ogpu may, in the majority of cases, utilize as auxiliary agents all Communists and Comsomols, Soviet officials, the militia, and non-Communist members, as well as thousands and tens of thousands of factory, Trades Union, co-operative, and housing committees: they are all subdued by its all-powerful hand. In he towns, half the population spies on and informs against the other half. The Ogpu gives no account of its actions to anyone. In principle, it is only responsible to the the Council of People’s Commissaries, one of whom holds the office of Commissary of Justice. But as this Council, together with the executive body of the Ogpu, is nominated by the Secretariat, the latter serves as a cover for all the operation of the police by automatically giving them its approval through the Political Bureau. In other words, the Ogpu is not responsible to any authority but its own. By its orders, prisons, detention camps, and deportation centers are filled to overflowing with workmen, Communists, Socialists, Trades Union members, free-thinkers, Zionists, and even Tolstoyans—thousands of them all sentenced without any semblance of a trial.
That puts so much into perspective for me. My own mom's mother died when Mom was only 22 years old. Breast cancer. She raised my brother and I without the chance to lean on her mom's advice and wisdom. I still can't believe how she managed to do such a great job without being able to call her mom and cry/shout/laugh/listen/vent. But she did. And so she and I are BOTH still learning how this new dynamic works, since it's a new experience for both of us. How the "Mother/Daughter who's also a Mother" relationship unfolds and evolves.

I have a special request and actually feel badly even asking. If you have time and can spare a prayer, could you please say one for me? I think in everyone's life, we go through bad cycles. While things could be so much worse, I have been going through a really rough time for the past several weeks. I am a person of faith and I know that things usually turn out for the best and know that everything will be okay. However, I am going through two major things are the same time and I am feeling overwhelmed by it. If you could include me in your prayers I would so appreciate it. I believe steadfastly in the power of prayer. If you need me to include you in my prayers, too, I would be honored to do so.
One thing that puzzles me is why no one has ever mentioned tubular breasts to me. I had one breast exam done in my teen years, and at least once at the beginning of each pregnancy. Have none of these doctors seen this before? Why hadn't one, just one, person said something? I realize nothing can be done but I spent many nights crying because I couldn't breast feed and felt I had selectively just given up, and that my body was normal. I had to discover this on my own and I just hope other women out there with the same condition are able to find the resources they need.

It may be exaggerating to say my life changed forever that day but in a way it did. That first episode had me addicted right away. I had never seen any other show like it.

3. Depression and self injury. I'm almost not sure that I "should" be writing about this, since although I've dealt with some depression in the past (not clinical depression, simply spending days on end in my room feeling extremely hopeless, useless, and depressed), I've never cut (or burned, or anything else). However, many of my friends have at one point or another. I've also done actual, search for stats and read mental health websites, research into self injury, since I very much wanted to be supportive to those who were dealing with it, and wanted to understand why.

The Drug Enforcement Administration also is prepared to look into, “in an appropriate manner and immediately,” allegations that it deems “credible” regarding its agents in El Salvador, agency spokesman Rusty Payne said. But he added that, while the DEA has seen news reports, “we are unaware of any allegations of misconduct.”
But since the Divine Miss S began repeating these allegations (from that darned lamestream media), I see a lot of us have collectively dropped that attitude of “Prove it” and now take any government action made in the vicinity of a donation to be more or less proof positive of corruption.

And the return of ‘the Dancer’ - Joshua Molloy, small-time Dublin ex-con, recently out of prison, off the booze, determined to stay on the straight and narrow. When Molloy hires Noelle Higgins, a solicitor and boom-time wife with a crumbling personal life, to help find his young son, both are soon drawn into a web of treachery and violence, where Ireland's criminal underworld and fallen elite fight it out to lay claim to what’s left from the crash: €3 million in cash, in a bag, buried somewhere in the depths of rural Ireland.

On Thursday night, I was once again dragged out to the theaters to see yet another Midnight release by my buddy Filmgoer along with about eight of our other friends. It was pretty much a "Scream Party Extravaganza". I'll be honest, before that day I had no interest in the series whatsoever. I had never even seen the first set of three until the night before when a few members of the "Scream Crew" came over and made me see them all. Even after that I still wasn't that hyped until I actually got to the theater the next day. Like my review on Sucker Punch, I wasn't planning on touching this one either, because in my opinion it was dam good and by the current ratings a lot of people agree. But I still do have a reason, that being because of the entire row sitting behind my crew bitching for two hours very loudly about how it was terrible and a waste of time. But for now, lets cover a synopsis of Wes Cravens latest chapter to this long running Franchise.

Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up? stands as a good example of how aliens were typically represented in TV and film, at least in my limited experience as a kid in the 1970s. Whether there was just one individual or a whole race of them, if there was an alien in the movie, undoubtedly the entire plot centered around its very existence. Its presence was a miracle of sorts, a unique anomaly, to be feared, fought, pondered or pursued.

I admit to being unbelievably thrown by my experience with The-Company-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. I think the combination of being treated so rudely and realizing that my Norwegian is not up to weathering the demands of a professional environment was just too much for me. I freaked out. I stopped going to Norwegian class and refused to speak Norwegian unless absolutely necessary. There was much ranting about moving not just from Sandefjord but from Norway, to a country---any country---where English is the first language. Much online searching for jobs and housing in New York, San Francisco, England, Scotland---did you know that Aberdeen, Scotland, apparently has a booming job market thanks to the oil and gas industry? When Husband said he was not interested in leaving Norway now, there was talk of a separation. (And let’s just say I’m using that word, “talk,” v-e-r-y loosely.) Yes, it’s been a stormy time for us.
