Cirque followers know that the laborious clown segments tend to be the show's weakest elements. And this show, written and directed by veteran clown David Shiner ("Fool Moon," "Kooza"), is stuffed with them. Barely five minutes pass before the first blow to a man's crotch. That pretty much sets the tone for the raucous proceedings, which are surprisingly not all that child-friendly -- one of the hunky performers even briefly drops trou.

USC's Selby offered two main explanations over the last two days for the low survival rate. First, he theorized that the numbers suffered because of the way the program handles liver patients who are also on kidney dialysis.

By contrast, USC doctors believe that most of these patients are better served by receiving only liver transplants because they say the kidneys often recover on their own afterward.

There should be considerable tax disincentives for corporations that move their manufacturing out of the U.S. We should not tell these corporations they cannot move, but if they do, it should cost them enough money where the trade-off is substantial.

The Heat won for several reasons: "When your vision clears up, rest assured that Miami 93, Knicks 85 happened for a reason today... It happened because we learned beyond a reasonable doubt that the Knicks cannot match up with Miami when they’re outnumbered in the star category (three to one, if you’re keeping score) — and they really don’t have any realistic expectation of pulling off a historic upset in this likely first-round playoff encounter... Not until we find out what Amar’e Stoudemire brings to the party, anyway — and his absence today makes it hard to glean many other conclusions from this one... Still, there is this takeaway: The Knicks — who will pass Philadelphia for seventh place one of these days and stay there — are likely to wear Melo out at this rate."

Sometimes, Kevin said, he would ask everyone to "step around" or "step over" a piece of red and white tape because there might be a hole or something delicate that might be damaged if anyone stepped on it.

"And in that time, you have to release that (suspect)," he said.
Du Maurier, the daughter of a famous British actor-manager and the wife of a famous British general, became more celebrated than either -- a beloved teller of tales whose work was frequently filmed. Her most famous book, of course, is "Rebecca," but, as Patrick McGrath argues in his introduction to this original collection of her stories, she was much darker when she turned to fiction in short form. "The Birds" is Rachel Carson meets the horror flick (and the original story is, if anything, more terrifying than the movie Hitchcock made from it). "Don't Look Now" has remarkable sexual tension and is reminiscent of Patricia Highsmith in some ways, while "The Blue Lenses" has a central idea that's one of the most original and scary you'll ever come across. She's a writer we think we know but don't really -- hugely underrated.

Maria Menounos performed a romantic Viennese waltz with Derek Hough for her first dance. She and Derek were shown struggling in rehearsals, but on the ballroom floor the two once again wowed as they performed the dramatic dance wearing shades of grey costumes. Bruno called it "heavenly fluidity," which brought Maria to tears. "I loved this dance and I loved the music and I love dancing with him," explained Maria. Carrie Ann was also welling up. "Something magical is happening between you, beside the dance," she said. Len quibbled that Maria "wasn't in hold" for enough of the dance, and the crowd promptly booed him. "I was a little bit of jerk," Derek admitted to host Brooke Burke-Charvet of his rehearsal behavior. Scores: 10, 8 , 10 = 28

That's been clear since the 1990s, when Democrats like John Breaux and Bob Kerrey came out for premium support. Then, as now, there followed not just the attacks, but the inevitable silence—from the media and those who otherwise make a career out of noisily deploring the deficit. With entitlements the crisis they say they are, you'd have thought at least the Erskine Bowles and the Alan Simpsons would be defending Mr. Wyden for acting.

Lowry attended yesterday's shootaround, his first team activity since being sidelined, but he is not ready to return and might not play again this season.

They're not going to see what you're going to see!" We were positioned directly across from the automobile gates. Mr. Alexander then stated, "Watch for the gatekeeper in the gatehouse.
