Williams said that Santorum is "lashing out to distract from his flailing campaign." He said Romney has always supported a state-by-state approach to health care reform.
Bush presided over eight straight budget deficits that effectively doubled the national debt. Before Bush got his hands on the policy-making machine the Congressional Budget Office estimated the debt would be paid off by the end of the last decade.

A legend was born on the field.
The evening closed with "Which Light in the Sky Is Us?" - a contemporary epic created for Company C by San Francisco's Gregory Dawson to a heavily sampled sound score by Ben Juodvalkis and Moses Sedler. Especially memorable among the interwoven ensembles, solos, duets and trios were Calvin Thomas Jr. and Van Ligon in a sinuous duet, and magnetic partnering by Freeston and Lindsay. Minimalist costumes - women in leotards and men in what were essentially Speedos - heightened the dancers' vulnerability and highlighted the company's evident strength.

Niebaum was a famous Finnish sea captain and fur trader in the 1800s. He settled in California and in 1880 founded the Inglenook Winery. The winery, located in what is now Napa's Rutherford appellation, was among the first in the United States to make wines in the Bordeaux style. Within 10 years, Niebaum's wines drew international praise and won gold medals at the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. Francis Ford Coppola, who directed, among others, the award-winning film "The Godfather," now owns the Niebaum property and has renamed it Rubicon Estate Winery.
You know, I've spent the past 15 years like, 'I'm a chef. You bring me food, and I'll cook it.' And it was really important to me to find that connection with the food, to know where it came from. So I asked to go on some pig hunts, because those things just run rampant down there. We literally dug a hole in the ground and set a trap with all of these sticks and green plantains -- those are like candy to the pigs. We got one, he was probably 200-250 pounds. I had to look that animal in the eye, kill it in the most humane, fastest way possible, then break it down and figure out how to cook it. I made three meals out of that pig. That was really a milestone for me.

Scientists have known for a while that the same pigments that give fruits and vegetables their color —carotenoids — can accumulate in your skin and give it color too. What they didn't know was this: How many fruits and vegetables do you have to eat for how long in order for people to notice the difference in your coloring? And what, if anything, will people think of the difference?

On Twitter there has been some backlash concerning Chris Brown and WWE being mentioned in the same sentence, mostly surrounding his 2009 assault of Rihanna. Others are upset Brown is ill-informed about the person he is beefing with (claiming Punk has used steroids, admitting he doesn't know anything about CM Punk in a tweet). To me, that's Brown's fault, and in that case he's silly to have replied in the fashion he has in the first place.
Even within the family, husbands frequently avoid using their wives' given names, instead addressing them as the mother of one of their children.
It also arrives with a smidge of controversy. Real-life Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg has called this based-on-the-true-story tale "fiction." Some folks have in turn criticized him for what they saw as a PR ploy: donating $100 million to the Newark, N.J., schools. Supposedly this was meant to brighten his image on the eve of the film's release and 'its unflattering portrayal.
"We'll veer from unique bar food -- 'King's Wings,' large pork shanks with a choice of sauces, and a Double Shaq burger, a 1-pound sandwich made with two steak burgers and a choice of toppings with cheese, mushrooms and bacon -- to things like cheddar-stuffed pierogi and Chilean sea bass drizzled with papaya butter, and a mushroom risotto," says Penney. He is returning to the area after a stint managing Blackfin restaurant in suburban Detroit.

Build Keystone XL, and there might be a short-term benefit — but at what long-term cost? It would surely accelerate the worst effects of climate change, which could result in rising sea levels, droughts, loss of freshwater reserves, an increased number of weather-related disasters, greater prevalence of disease and famine, political turmoil, and the deaths of millions. That's simply too steep a price, all of which would be paid by future generations.
Large U.S. corporations are still solid long-term investments. U.S. blue-chip companies are reporting good earnings, and some have incredible amounts of cash on hand -- $1.24 trillion, according to Moody's. Apple Inc. on Friday likely had more cash than the U.S.

But, we do like Pinkston a lot and we think he's going to be a really good player. We'll see how it shakes out this week and who's going to be starting at left guard. We think he can do it, we think (John) Greco can do it. We're in pretty good shape, we think, but that's not to say we're not going to add anybody here in the next couple days."

Construction of these projects is expected to buoy the company's results for the rest of this year and much of next year. Aaron Chew, an analyst at Maxim Group, notes that those projects have locked in relatively high power rates because they were designed before panel prices had fallen so far. Chew and other analysts worry that future projects won't be nearly as profitable — and wonder whether First Solar will be able to win those big projects now that competing panels are as cheap, or cheaper.

It seems that the best idea is to create a will that leaves the property to your children. If you want them to avoid probate, you can create a simple trust, title the property in the name of the trust, and name your children as beneficiaries.

Their respective strategists are probably telling both Obama and Romney to avoid specificity and new thinking that might open them to counterattack. Undoubtedly, both are being told to energize their political bases by tearing down the opponent. That cheapens discussion and feeds silly verbal battles over the value of stay-at-home mothers or dog care.

Same goes for AnnaStella's take on a strictly New Orleans classic, turtle soup ($8.25/$12.99). Seriously thick, it has the overwhelming flavor of tomato. There is a lot of meat in there — turtle is rich and tender and reminiscent of dark meat chicken — but it becomes little more than a texture foil to the tomato. A potential fix: Thin it out with some water and add a traditional splash of sherry. The same sized serving could cost half as much and showcase the turtle better.
Should J.Lo ever try to be a real judge, though, Milian said she could pull it off.
“You're getting a half a gallon a minute through a pinhole,” he said. “It's really squirting out. It'll cut your hand off.

It's really, really hard, having relationships with people who aren't musicians and don't understand what you're dealing with. I think the saddest part is I've lost a lot of my friends, because they don't understand the lifestyle. You're home so little, it's hard to keep up with them. People change and move on and start hanging out with other people. Meeting other bands on the road, they're some of my best friends now, because they understand what you're going through.

U.S. nationals are always problematic for the team's most accomplished World Cup athletes. Vonn clearly established herself as the world's best ski racer this winter, breaking the women's record for World Cup points, so U.S. nationals had to feel a little anticlimactic. Vonn competed in 37 of 38 women's World Cup races this winter, winning 12.
He was also an author, with "Dick Clark's American Bandstand" and such self-help books as "Dick Clark's Program for Success in Your Business and Personal Life" and "Looking Great, Staying Young." His unchanging looks inspired a joke in "Peggy Sue Gets Married," the 1986 comedy starring Kathleen Turner as an unhappy wife and mother transported back to 1960.

Marian Gaborik tallied with 5:19 remaining in the third overtime, sending the New York Rangers past Washington, 2-1, in Game 3 of this Eastern Conference semifinal from Verizon Center. Rangers center Brad Richards gained control of the puck off a Dan Girardi wraparound to the left rear of the Washington net, and fed in front for Gaborik, who ripped a wrister home to cap the marathon contest.

Over the years, McCabe's fiction has been labeled by some as "bog Gothic," and both "The Holy City" and "Winterwood" probably will be too. As an appellation, it's a double-edged sword since "bog" is a traditional Irish Protestant epithet for things Catholic and McCabe comes from a county, Monaghan, sodden with rocky bogs. The gothic sensibility has flourished in Irish literature as in no other, though its practitioners all have been Protestant writers. The historian and literary biographer Roy Foster has referred to the Gothic as "Protestant magic," while psychoanalytically inclined commentators have located its inspirations in the Ascendancy's anxieties: vampire blood-sucking equals colonialism and the frightening bump in the night is incipient rebellion.

Normally, these vessels regulate the supply of blood to the heart tissue when demands are higher — at times of stress, for example, or during exercise when the heart pumps faster. But in many women (and some men), this process becomes dysfunctional, and the microvessels fail to respond properly. This can lead to ischemia, a starving of the heart tissue of oxygen and nutrients. If severe enough or prolonged, this ischemia can cause the same end result that plugged-up arteries cause — not enough blood supply when demand is high, leading to a heart attack.

"Parents have to realize that when you have a close relationship with your child and your child knows what your values are, based on what you say and what you do," Cohen-Sandler says, "there's very little chance your child will be led astray by some peer and do something completely antithetical to your values or their values.

Romney had based his campaign, in part, on his career as an astute businessman. But the film undercut that narrative with lines such as "His mission: to reap massive rewards for himself and his investors." The film and a shortened version of it that was turned into a campaign ad "allowed the other candidates to attack Romney about Bain," said Jamieson, damaging Romney's "central claim."
Then Emanuel opened the Office for New Americans to provide information on city services to recent immigrants. He got it right when he called immigrants the "lifeblood" and "economic engine" of Chicago.
(On how important it is to draft a young linebacker to get into the rotation)- "That's something we are thinking about. In our opinion, it's not a great linebacker draft. That's not saying we aren't going to get one. It's just not, I don't know how else to say it. Hopefully we can get some young guys in here and see what they do."

Cleveland's second-largest bank also said that, as of Monday, it's under new restrictions from the Office of Thrift Supervision. Third Federal came under fire from OTS last summer for having too many potentially risky loans - mainly because of its 30 percent concentration in second mortgages, meaning home equity lines or loans. These are more risky because in case of a foreclosure, in a foreclosure, they get paid second, which means they may not get repaid at all.

It's not the most luxurious place on the Mara, but it feels good to stay here.
When asked whether he was inciting violence, Muhammad replied: "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
Most of the film's technical effects are squirmy miscalculations. The photography is deliberately dingy, evoking the squalid atmosphere of small-town sports locker rooms. This movie looks like athlete's foot smells. The punch-ups are intended to play like hilarious misadventures, yet director Michael Dowse films them as if he were making the sequel to "Raging Bull," complete with slo-mo blood and broken teeth splattering to Puccini's "Turandot."
On the receiving end of that instruction, young Jordan watches carefully as Jacobs shows her how to wrap wire around the slender nose of a tiny pair of pliers. This is not Jordan's first class -- in fact, the budding designer just made her mom a necklace and a pair of earrings for Mother's Day.
But since then, Umenyiora has worked to be a well-rounded player. And as he showed with a forced fumble that saved a touchdown in the Divisional Round victory over the Packers, he's still very much a difference maker.
Carter, of course, is our storyteller, and one of many gems is the Beatles' last public performance on the rooftop at No. 3 Saville Row in central London in 1969. Carter said it was at "the new Apple headquarters around mid-day on Thursday, Jan. 30. The temperature was a nippy 40 degrees. It lasted a full 42 minutes and may well have gone on longer had it not been for the complaints of their neighbor, Stanley Davis, a wool merchant next door who was not a Beatle fan, so it seemed. I pieced together the best recordings and linked them together to give the real deal on the rooftop."

It's the showy end to a meal that is so current it could easily be served in New York or San Francisco. It seems all the more astounding because of the quaint decor and the garden that ties it indelibly to Sonoma County. Like Cyrus, Madrona Manor should be a must-visit destination on any food lover's checklist.

What the Citizens United decision and a lower court ruling have done is make household names out of a bunch of relatively unknown, very wealthy conservatives. Of the top 10 donors to super PACs so far in the 2012 election cycle, seven are individuals - not corporations - and four of those individuals are billionaires.
Here are a few other sites mentioned in "On the Road to Freedom."
Yeah, well. If an unknown middle-age male singer with strong pipes walked out on the stage and looked like Luciano Pavarotti, say, or Van Morrison or Ice Cube, we would rise to our collective feet and celebrate the debut of the next Luciano Pavarotti, Van Morrison or Ice Cube without so much as a whisper about the need for a makeover.

There have been several attacks targeting Western hotels, restaurants and an embassy since then. But all have been far less deadly, thanks in part, security experts say, to a relentless crackdown on Jemaah Islamiyah that has largely decimated their ranks.

No cause has yet been determined, but either mechanical failure or pilot error would be a blow to Russia's image. If the plane itself was at fault, orders almost certainly would dry up. The plane's pilot was described as one of Russia's most experienced, and if his error caused the crash it would follow a run of Russian airline disasters blamed on poorly trained or inattentive crews.
In my 14 years of teaching, I have always contributed 9.4 percent of my paycheck toward my pension while the state has contributed its actuarially required share a total of three times (the last three years). Perhaps unions weren't spending time "brokering sweet deal," as the Tribune commonly asserts. Would any other taxpayer allow his or her employer to skip out on the 6.2 percent Social Security payment?

Thus begins Oskar's odyssey, in which he walks throughout the five boroughs -- one of his fears is using public transportation -- showing up on the doorstep of everyone named Black. He packs for his trip as he might for a hiking trip and carries along a tambourine, which he shakes to calm his nerves. His first stop is the home of a couple (Viola Davis and Jeffrey Wright) in the middle of a break-up. The situation is awkward, but there is something about Oskar and his story that charms most of the people he visits.

This is no ceremonial job, grudgingly handed over by the team owner to a popular former player to appease the fans, though it is no coincidence that Anderson has maintained a friendly relationship with Peter Angelos and his two sons since he was in uniform. Clearly, he also excels at the games people play on the corporate level.

"It took me a little time in Arizona to get used to a little better pitching, the quicker pace to the game, the speed of the players," he said. "That was definitely an advantage to go there and I have 30 to 40 games on guys who are starting their first year at Double A."
Hey, Tony: Do you agree we need to bring Peyton Hillis back next year? Everybody agrees this team is in desperate need of playmakers. I believe the reason Hillis was sub-par this year was truly his health and likely the struggles of both guards this year and the loss of Eric Steinbach. Let's keep the only playmaker we have, and focus on the guards, WR, and especially the QB in free agency and the draft. Many mock drafts have us taking RB Trent Richardson in the first round. Note to Tom Heckert, maybe the two best RBs in the league -- Maurice Jones-Drew and Adrian Peterson -- are on teams worse than the Browns since they have no passing games. Doesn't that prove you need to start with the pass? -- Nathan Cornell, Minneapolis
Public works spokesman Kurt Kocher said the department will work to address the backlog of complaints.

Again like the Kings, who have several Cup winners on their team and others like Stoll who lost in the finals, the Blues can look for guidance from players who have extensive playoff experience. Winger Jamie Langenbrunner won with Dallas in 1999 and again with New Jersey in 2003, and center Jason Arnott won with New Jersey in 2000, and they’ve helped their less-experienced teammates cope with playoff pressure.
The longer the unemployment rate stays at 9 percent, the louder the debate grows over what to do about it.
And its impact is being acknowledged. Next month, San Francisco-based Skyy Spirits will change its name to Campari America. Known for Skyy vodka and Wild Turkey, the company is aligning itself with Italian parent company Gruppo Campari.

There were also further signs that Lady Gaga, frustrated by the emotional limitations of speedy synthpop, is groping toward naturalism. One of the highlights of the concert was a slow, passionately-sung solo piano reading of "Born This Way." The reinterpretation of the single, which was far more Laura Nyro than Madonna, was such an improvement over the mechanized, tricked-out hit version that it was hard not to wish she could get back to the studio and re-cut it before the album comes out.

In Atlantic City, the song was as measured as classic Elton John; at Prudential Center, it was as unhinged, and inflamed, as the Dresden Dolls.

That's not to say anyone should panic. Cellphones do produce a type of radiation, but it's of the type called nonionizing radio frequency -- a form of energy located on the electromagnetic spectrum.

But the weak signals released by nonionizing radio frequencies do not cause DNA damage, and there is no explanation for how such energy could cause cancer, McCormick says.
