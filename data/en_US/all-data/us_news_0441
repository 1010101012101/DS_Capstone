But the region took a body blow when Ford and Chrysler left town and took tens of thousands of jobs with them, and that, coupled with the depths of the broader recession, should lend new sense of urgency, Brewer said. (The collapse of the St. Louis auto industry was the impetus for the report.) Without change now, Brewer said, the St. Louis economy will continue to lag behind its peers, with jobs and growth drifting away.
Invest in Internet security software whether you are on a PC or Mac. Turn your Mac's firewall on (the default setting has it turned off).

Scientists have named the Webb telescope as the top priority in their last two "decadal surveys" — a "to do" list drawn up by consensus every 10 years. It would be bigger and 10 times more powerful than the 21-year-old Hubble Space Telescope, able to see more of the earliest stars and galaxies, in greater detail.
If you miss having Rocky up on the bed, you can allow him back up after a couple of weeks. That's usually enough time to break a habit. But keep the kennel in your room (with an open door) in case he reverts to old behaviors. I suspect you'll find him in his kennel at other times because he will have learned that it's a good place to relax.
The pledges came as a result of an annual U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, a meeting that came this year amid ongoing drama over a blind Chinese activist who had sought U.S. protection. While the U.S. and China used the meetings to try to influence the policies the other will take over the coming year, the results don't represent a treaty or a pact and aren't enforceable.

Hey, Matthew: I think I know what a fullback is. He's the big guy who lines up in front of the tailback and blocks for him, right? Sometimes carries the ball, usually with both arms wrapped around it, plowing straight ahead for short-yardage gains? What I don't understand is why coaches who run the West Coast want the fullback to play a variety of roles rather than just let him do what he is physically built to do best.
3. Lightly sprinkle a board or other clean surface with some of the remaining flour. Turn the dough out onto the board and sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour. With floured hands, fold the dough in half, and pat dough into a 1/3- to 1/2-inch thick round, using a little additional flour only if needed. Flour again and fold the dough in half a second time.

For example, to meet the growing appetite for spinach and salad greens, growers in the 1980s dramatically expanded farm acreage and developed large-scale processing facilities. They came up with innovative packaging materials, and a highly efficient refrigerated "cold chain" that could get salads, spinach and other products from field to grocery display case in 48 hours or less. Then, because retailers recognized the massive profit potential in year-round availability (the longer a particular fruit or vegetable is kept in stock, the more of it consumers will buy), they pushed the industry to create a supply chain that follows the growing season as it moves across the country -- or the planet.

Proposition 29 is well intentioned, but it just doesn't make sense for the state to get into the medical research business to the tune of half a billion dollars a year when it has so many other important unmet needs. California can't afford to retain its K-12 teachers, keep all its parks open, give public college students the courses they need to earn a degree or provide adequate home health aides for the infirm or medical care for the poor. If the state is going to raise a new $735 million, it should put the money in the general fund rather than dedicating it to an already well-funded research effort. Funding priorities shouldn't be set at the ballot box.
The concise menu also includes two salads (each $8) and two burgers (each $8.75). A Smash Burger is indeed meat smashed on the grill, so the half-pound local grass-fed beef is a tad dry, but it's saved by a juicy mantle of grilled onions, melted Wisconsin sharp cheddar, barbecue mayonnaise and crunchy Alexander Valley butter pickles on a doughy roll. There are also occasional vegetarian specials.
On Tuesday, hundreds of federal agents fanned out around the country, raiding businesses, seizing documents and charging 107 suspects in Miami, Los Angeles, Houston, Detroit, Chicago, Tampa, Fla., and Baton Rouge, La. The government suspended payment to 52 providers as part of the investigations.

I'll take the doughnuts, Lori, but there's still more mystery. Whose Oscar was it? It wasn't Brian DePalma's -- he's racked up some Golden Globes (and even five Razzies) over the years, but has been snubbed by the Academy. Sure, it could have been an obscure Oscar for something like "development of a system of xenon arc lamphouses" and "engineering of fluid-damped camera heads," but there didn't seem to be anything at all for any of DePalma's films except a best supporting actor win for Sean Connery in 1987 for "The Untouchables," but that didn't match the time frame. If it had indeed been something Sean Connery had touched, my mom definitely would have stolen it.

He remembered being one of thousands standing in long lines at a Cleveland career fair. There were few jobs. Hardly any in manufacturing like he was seeking. Lambert stopped by Tri-C's table and learned about the precision machining technology program. Lambert, 49, decided to enroll in the program. In February 2010 he graduated from the six-month program. Federal grants paid for most of the $3,000 in tuition and related costs.
Berman campaign senior advisor Brandon Hall accused Sherman of "padding his fundraising numbers" through the 2014 donations, which can't be spent in the current race, and the loans. Sherman spokesman John Schwada called that assertion "silly," noting that the 2014 donations amount to less than 1% of Sherman's stockpile. The loans, Schwada said, should be viewed as a "counterbalance" to the donations of super PACs, which can independently receive and spend unlimited amounts to support or oppose candidates. At least two such groups have formed to support Berman, records show.

For a film like this to work, you need an immediate connection to the characters. Or you need the two characters to be extremely charming, clever and likable so that it doesn't really matter what they are up to. Or you need what they're up to to be so diverting that it doesn't matter much if the characters lack connectivity or likability.

WR Ramses Barden. He said during the bye week he felt like “the man” against the Cowboys last year when Manning threw to him even though he was blanketed by LB Keith Brooking. Well, Manning went for him Sunday even though DB Phillip Adams was all over him. And I mean all over him. Barden made the catch and spun away from Adams for another 8 yards and a first down. People were asking if I really thought this guy could make an impact when he came back. I told them I believed he would. And now, I do even more.

Since the shower will be at your house, your organizer will need to work with you on planning and timing, say 2–3 months after the wedding. Other early decisions include choosing an invitation style, guest list, time of day and party theme. Whitehead reminds us to personalize the theme with the passions and personalities of the couple. Will there be an event highlighting their hobbies, like a cooking or wine tasting lesson, signature cocktail, international menu or a favorite color/symbol/seasonal theme? Make sure you have enough lead time to put on a thoughtful and stylish party. And don't be afraid to delegate jobs like the menu, champagne, flowers and music to others.

Jets GM Mike Tannenbaum has often said he's a believer in the philosophy of former Packers GM Ron Wolf: Draft a quarterback a year. Except the Jets already added a quarterback this year, via their bold trade for Tim Tebow. The Jets look to be set with starter Mark Sanchez, Tebow and Greg McElroy, a seventh-round pick last year. Of all the positions on the roster, quarterback's at the bottom of the list for this draft. Perhaps the Jets' only need is a No. 4 quarterback to take some training camp reps, but they don't need to draft that.

“A lot of times, they gave them away, they got a new one ordered for them, they got one replaced,” said Carey, offering his best guess. “In other champions’ cases, they didn’t make a lot of money (and sold them).

Blake Shelton, playing immediately ahead of bride Lambert, capitalized on his newfound fame from his role on NBC's "The Voice" and longtime onstage persona as a bad boy of country. He's a delightful loose cannon in an over-scripted world who's not truly threatening, and country fans love that he publicly displays not only his love but also his respect — and just the right amount of fear — for the Pistol he married last year.

Asia is home to several pivot states. Indonesia, with the world's fourth-largest population, enjoys a stable political environment with solid growth and a well-diversified economy. Its trade ties are well balanced among China, the U.S., Japan and Singapore—and are likely to remain so.

OK, it wasn't an intimate gathering. Other people were there too - half of Canada, by my estimation. The group was performing a free concert at an outdoor venue which, thwarted from attending by lack of tickets, we decided to watch anyway by strolling across the wide tops of the wall of the Old City. It was a precarious perch; two elephant steps forward was a drop to our deaths. And at that distance, the Peas were indeed pea-sized, but the crowd atop the wall was polite, restrained - this was Canada, remember. They were quite mellow, really, for hip-hop.

The look or looks you're creating displease your own eye, but you're stuck on the vision of how they look on others.

The robocalls began at 5:55 p.m., prosecutors said. By 8 p.m., as the polls closed, the calls were finished.
I have long known (though I've yet to give up trying) that it is almost impossible to motivate smokers to quit for good by regaling them with the health hazards of tobacco. And now I've been told by readers of last week's column, "Even More Reasons to Get a Move On," that repeated sermons on the health benefits of physical activity may get some folks started but are unlikely to keep them at it.
"Frank Gartland has never come to me in any way, shape or form proposing anything illegal or in a gray area. He has always been straightforward," O’Leary said.

They have reported to Freeman that Sproul suffered multiple broken bones and burns. Lachendro's body had extensive burns as well.
Like a lot of houses of the movie nouveaux riches still in their social and business rise, the grand exterior is not matched by a grand interior. When the Menendez family bought the house, it was handsomely furnished, and they could have bought the furniture from the former owner for an extra $350,000, but they declined. With the exception of some reproduction Chippendale chairs in the dining room, the house is appallingly furnished with second-rate pieces; either the purchase price left nothing for interior decoration or there was just a lack of interest. In any case, your attention, once you are in the house, is not on the furniture. You are drawn, like a magnet, to the television room.
"I have a great respect for the type of liberties that we’re given in this country," said Sodergren, who supports the use of scanners as secondary screening for passengers who arouse suspicion.

“They have a lot of fight, they have a lot of heart,’’ said Chaplin. “We don’t have as much depth as somne of the other teams but the energy is great right now. We want to go into this and have no regrets, that’s what we’re pushing for. Our motto is leave everything out on the floor.’’
The airport eliminated free 30-minute parking at the facility earlier this year. The plane people announced the change before it took place on April 1. The news didn't reach everyone.

PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Kyle Lohse scattered six hits while pitching into the eighth inning to lead the St. Louis Cardinals past Pittsburgh.
Dolphins are so cute that many kids wish they could have them as pets. These marine cuties are too big for the home aquarium, so kids will have to content themselves with watching pint-sized characters nurse an injured dolphin back to health in "Dolphin Tale."

Their foe? A crime lord, Chudnofsky (Christoph Waltz), whose name is so unpronounceable that everyone (including James Franco, in a mildly amusing opening cameo) makes a joke of it.

"The other day I was up in Palo Alto, heading back for a meeting and had to grab some lunch, so I checked to see who was close by and BBQ Kalbi happened to be there right off the freeway," the Sunnyvale resident said of the Korean barbecue taco truck.

"He was oozing with confidence and competitiveness," Ross said. "He's always had that bravado, that competitiveness. He was always a driven young man. ... He's always thought he had something to prove."
Stravinsky's score includes a haunting berceuse, or lullaby, sometimes rendered as an enchanting solo for the Firebird. Instead, Ratmansky uses the excerpt as a pas de quatre for Ivan, Kaschei, the marriageable Maiden and the Firebird. Choreographically, it's the equivalent of a Verdi quartet in which each singer vocalizes an inner monologue while the collective voices produce lush harmonies. "All four are moving onstage to the slow part of the music and thinking to themselves about what is happening," Osipova says. "It looks like they are all together, but they are not together. The lullaby is like a magic act."
The merger received a slightly warmer reception from Rutgers president Richard L. McCormick, who described it as "potentially feasible." Rutgers is aggressively adding online courses in many fields, looking to boost revenue as state support declines.

For all of the grief that QB Joe Flacco seems to endure, he more than proved himself in the AFC Championship Game against the Pats. WR Torrey Smith emerged as a legit deep threat. But Baltimore staying at the top of the AFC will hinge on what happens to RB Ray Rice.

"They need people that know the show inside and out because we do it in one rehearsal," Muspratt said. "All the images come with the show. They bring their own sound and video people with them so it runs very exactly. We have to rent an enormous screen at the Mac - it's almost the size of the stage - so that it's really vivid and enormous and sort of overwhelming in a good way. There's no moment on stage when any of those four singers aren't doing something. Sometimes they're singing and there's ‘Little Mermaid' going on the screen. It's really fun. A little girl would be totally fine with the concert."

One older neighborhood sits on low ground near a canal. The tsunami came in from the canal side and blasted through the frail wooden houses, coating the interiors with a thick layer of mud and spilling their contents out into the street on the other side.
One change from last year is that my budget proposal should not come as a surprise to anyone. We will be talking in school board meetings and budget committee meetings about the reductions we are considering before the proposal is shared with the public. In fact, we've already started providing this information at board meetings. We have talked many times, for example, about how decreasing enrollment will necessitate staff reductions next fall.

But, scratching one's head, and looking a little deeper into the matter, it made more sense.
(Not surprisingly, the resolution doesn't require informing travelers, especially college students in spring, to not drink themselves into a coma. That would be asking a lot - it's just easier to blame foreign destinations for not having enough stomach pumps.)

Once community staples, neighborhood butcher shops began losing favor a few decades ago, a victim to the popular plastic-wrapped cuts offered by white-floored supermarkets. Today, they're making a comeback in gastronomic hubs -- and places such as Brooklyn's Meat Hook, San Francisco's Olivier's Butchery and Santa Cruz's el Salchichero are finding success by focusing on meat from sustainably raised animals.

On the contrary, almost two decades after the 1994 free-trade agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada, the idea of North American integration is losing steam.

which tries to offer dirt-cheap fares and hits customers with lots of add-on fees for everything from soft drinks to window seats, added a fee for carry-on bags that go in overhead bins last year.

Carry-ons can cost as much as $40 each way, more expensive than Spirit's checked-bag fee, which starts at $28 and goes as high as $38, depending on how and when you pay it.

Brady: Governor Kulongoski appointed me in 2007 to the Oregon Health Fund Board and he set us off on a path that seemed impossible at the time. But we were able to leverage over a billion dollars in federal funding so we now have access to health care for almost every child in Oregon.

I bring a background of being able to leverage dollars to this job.

•Where are the voters? Congrats to Mayor Buddy Dyer on a decisive victory. Still, did you notice how few people voted? Fewer than 21,000. And only about half as many people as voted in 2008. To put 21,000 in perspective, more people live in Casselberry. The low turnout in Orlando elections - Glenda Hood once won with only 7,500 votes - is largely the result of holding municipal elections by themselves. Sure, you attract people who truly care about how the city's run. The problem is, that's apparently only about 15 percent of the population.

But clearly he becomes more dangerous when he’s penetrating and drawing defenders. So Anthony and the Knicks' help-defenders need to try to contain James and turn him into a more of a jump shooter... 'He’s good enough to where he can hit those (outside) shots and it’s all for naught,' the scout said, 'but I think the percentages say make him a perimeter shooter, a 3-point shooter.'"

Some incorrectly use the efficiency argument as a reason to lease. A private operator will buy the same concrete, blacktop, steel, rock salt and snowplows. Admittedly, it will cut workers' pay, overall a minimal cost savings. Remember, the turnpike now has electronic tolling and automated toll machines at the low-volume interchanges. A private operator will have essentially the same operating expenses, while having the additional costs of the lease payment, financing costs of that lease payment and, of course, the need to make a profit. A publicly owned toll road operates under the model of keeping tolls as low as practical to maximize traffic. Profit is not a dirty word; however, the private operator will try to maximize profit. A 25 percent toll increase, for example, may decrease traffic by 10 percent; that would, however, still increase both profit and revenue. A leased toll road can only survive and make big payments to the state by dramatically increasing toll rates over time. Knowing that transportation costs will always be substantially higher will hurt northern Ohio.

Bummer that the wagon is only equipped to keep premade sandwiches warm, so when Falafelwich runs out of food for the day, the fun is done.

The frauds began almost as soon as gold was discovered in California in 1848. Eastern promoters put together groups of men who would travel to the Gold Rush country and pan for precious metal. Those who didn't want to leave home could finance them. A thousand companies were formed in the first two years of the Gold Rush, and investors in both the U.S. and Europe put up $20 million to back them, most of the money going into the promoters' pockets. There were even cons involving water and quicksilver, both essential to mining. Of course, the losses didn't dissuade anyone, and in the first decade of the Gold Rush, some 100,000 individuals wagered $200 million on the mines.

Immigrants also drive new business creation. More than 40% of our Fortune 500 companies were founded by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant  companies like Google, Yahoo, and Intel. In Michigan, major companies like Dow, Masco and Meijer were founded by immigrants, as were major New York City companies like Pfizer, Foursquare and Nathans Famous. Yet the longer we wait to fix our broken immigration laws, the more these innovative companies will be founded overseas. If that is allowed to happen, we will do enormous damage to Americas future and our standing as the worlds economic superpower.
At the same time, most evangelicals and other conservatives who make up the base of the GOP are strongly opposed to gay marriage.

The former Massachusetts governor opposes gay marriage but has spoken in favor of gay rights in the past.
"While they were surveying the land, he happened to be wearing a red sweater and was apparently charged by a bull," said Cindy Friedman, communications manager for Freixenet in Sonoma.

LaBute’s “Autobahn” is a collection of one-act plays set within the confines of the front seat. The seven vignettes are an unsettling montage exploring the ethos of perception and relationship. “The Shape of Things” is thematically similar to his film “In the Company of Men,” but with the genders reversed. The plays contain mature themes, language and subject matter.

A: It was a Pinnacle Gold. I usually don't use Pinnacles but I had to go over some water and I was afraid I'd knock it in the water. So, I figured if I was going to lose the ball I might as well lose a Pinnacle. I'm going to have it mounted."
There are still plenty of fish to be found, however, as we discovered by working white-feathered marabou jigs and yellow and green Mister Twisters in the deeper waters of the rocky north coves and along the dam. We caught more crappies than we could keep, and, as a bonus, white bass often hit right on the water's surface.

The chow: Focus on the small plates, mostly bar basics with a bit of Southern spin, four sandwiches and a couple of salads -- nothing more than $8. A pulled pork quesadilla ($7) gets some sweet zing from a homemade bourbon barbecue sauce. Country fritters ($6) are perfectly fried puffs of cornmeal, ham and cheese, though they deserve a better dipping side than grainy mustard. The hearty Frito pie ($6) -- a New Mexican dish -- puts chili, cheddar cheese and jalapeños over crunchy chips.
Barney Rosset, five times married to interesting women, relentless lunger on tennis courts (he bloodied his knees rushing the net against me), enthusiastic gourmet of forbidden substances, world champion check grabber; rest in anti-peace.

Newspaper readership is way down; the number of eligible voters who don't vote is way up. One-quarter of our population is under 18. In the year 2000, we elected (sort of) one of least informed leaders we ever had, and we are routinely treated to news stories about candidates for our highest offices who think the voting age is 21, that the "shot heard 'round the world" was fired in New Hampshire, or that Paul Revere made his gallant ride to warn the British of something or other.
Working with Little Blue Box Weddings out of Sausalito, the couple chose a courtyard wedding followed by dinner in V. Sattui's romantic wine barrel room.

The Pac-12, which thought it maximized its situation with the increase from 10 to 12 teams by adding Utah and Colorado, would then be forced (or so it will claim) to match the 16-team powers by adding a few schools.

"I'm just trying to be more aggressive," Turner said. "When I am open, shoot it. It's not hard, but you have to feel it out."
The western is perhaps the most American of genres, a historic symbol of Hollywood supremacy and still among the most durable of narrative templates, as recent movies as different as "Meek's Cutoff" and "True Grit" have shown. The striking thing about the films in this set is that they date from a period when the Old West was still a living reality, when tales of the frontier were recent history and had not yet fully hardened into myth.

The motive for my original article was a calculation that a Republican can't win the presidency next year; none of the party's candidates look strong enough to overcome the handicaps that President Bush has imposed on them. Therefore, I had no choice but to size up the Democrats from a conservative point of view. Which one is least bad?
Over a 5-minute, 49-second stretch rarely seen and seldom heard in Denver professional basketball history, the Nuggets outscored the Lakers 24-2. Two dozen to two. The Nuggets surged for 19 consecutive points at one point. The Lakers were gasping in the air up there.

It's not merely how Streep physically transforms herself into Thatcher, England's only female prime minister (1979-90), who endured many trials from good-old-boy sexism to the Falklands War.
His impact has been considerable — at least when the players could fully hear him. Sutter has moments in which he mumbles, and does so quite often in his media sessions. Even Charles Barkley satirized one of his postgame news conferences on "Saturday Night Live."

"So far, no one has yelled at me from their car that they hate it as they drive by. But, you know, even when I was in Sleater-Kinney, I've never been in something that's been universally loved. I'm OK with that. I think creating conversations with people is the best creative work you can put out. I'm fine with there being a dialogue about it. I know that I have an abiding love and affection for Portland. But I don't expect everyone to cheerlead for 'Portlandia.'"

“Hannan was a dear friend who lived a life of selflessness through both his service in the military and in the Church. In the military, he not only earned the nickname 'The Jumping Padre' when he ministered to the 82nd Airborne, but he also literally crawled towards danger to help his fellow soldiers. As a spiritual leader, he continued his mission to serve people. From the time he first arrived in Louisiana, Archbishop Hannan helped comfort the people of New Orleans and our entire state as we worked to rebuild after multiple storms. While he is no longer with us, we can honor his legacy by striving towards living a life of service and sacrifice."

"There are a lot of dissatisfied members that just want to get out as soon as possible," he said. "They're just waiting for money.

There are, of course, many prominent, non-Jersey acts that have never done the Super Bowl halftime and could land the gig. Madonna surely would put on a memorable show. So would Elton John, or Van Halen, or AC/DC.

A few of the items did manage to lose my attention. Fish and chips ($18) had a good concept - crisp shoestring fries as the chips for three sizable pieces of breaded cod - but the batter clumped at the edges, resulting in all bread and no fish in several bites. A 12-ounce slice of prime rib ($25) was moist and cooked rare, as ordered, but two or three of those ounces were an excessive amount of fat at the lip.
