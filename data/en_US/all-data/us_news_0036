California Department of Transportation acting Director Malcolm Dougherty said the findings reflected Caltrans' own examination of the issue.
The film opened in Plano, Texas -- an upscale suburb of Dallas -- and did great business there, too. Falk says for the first week in Jacksonville, Fla., "we did double anything else we did that week.'' Even in Utah, where there was a brief flap when one Salt Lake City exhibitor pulled the movie, "Brokeback'' is doing very well.
In trying to resolve Chen's current situation, Beijing could lay the blame on local officials as a way to save face. In a similar fashion, when a village in southern China protesting against land seizures drove their local leaders out late last year, higher level authorities resolved the dispute by blaming village leaders they said had acted corruptly.
Concerns about "fracking" are moving from the oil field to the board room.
Even a sophisticated charter organization like Green Dot achieves mixed results. With 18 schools and a comprehensive headquarters staff, Green Dot is practically a district unto itself. But although its campuses typically outscore nearby traditional schools, fewer than 5% of students at several of its campuses scored at the "proficient" level in math last year.
And it was also cool to watch Del McCoury, a bluegrass icon who once played with Bill Monroe, take shouted song requests from the audience on the main stage (!) on the festival's second day. Yeah, the bowl looked a little sad with so few people in the stands for the headlining sets, but hopefully Benn and his London company, Festival Republic, will find a way to return.
Consumers should note that all these amounts in fortified foods pale in comparison with the quantities found naturally in fatty fish, says Susan Bowerman, assistant director of the ULCA Center for Human Nutrition. Three ounces of wild Alaska salmon provide 1,000 to 1,500 mgs of EPA and DHA combined; the same goes for 3 ounces of sardines.
Rick began managing Olivieri's and in 1995, three years before Herbert died at 64, renamed the shop after himself.
"What we do as a staff is we have a lot of clarity with everything we talk about," Hoke said. "How we want to approach the academics, how we want to approach socially with each other, then the football part. The opportunity these guys have from an educational standpoint ... they've got tutors and advisers. (Still), every day, we've got to talk to our guys, positionally or whatever else, to remind them why they're here. That's a big part of it."
"Though we do not believe Jesus was resurrected, we do believe God lifted him up to him, and that there will one day be a second coming," Amer said.
"We had good size on defense, a good, solid corps of defensive defensemen," Bowman said. "We played a real tight game and waited for opportunities. We had Berenson, who was a terrific player in the West Division, and he was able to score a few goals. But I think when you have guys who can play good defense, you frustrate the other teams, you know?"

The Quakes and their double rooting brigades - the chanting Ultras and the drum-beating Casbah - couldn't be more delighted.
Moscoso's résumé works in his favor. He started 21 games last season for Oakland, so he won't be evaluated solely on spring training. Chatwood received a baptism by blowtorch last season with the Angels. If Rockies players were asked to pick the last starter, they'd go with Chatwood because his stuff is electric. But that also could translate into a power arm in the bullpen.
Gordon, with one detective assigned to the JTTF, said he has never heard a concern about civil rights violations. "There's no better way to monitor that than to have a deputy sheriff or a police officer in the mix," he said.

STAY IN CHARGE YOURSELF. Ordinary TCI doesn't give you the flexibility to decide, in advance, that you don't want to risk visiting or cruising in an area likely to be hit. If you want to keep control of your own decision whether to go or cancel, get "cancel for any reason" TCI. Yes, it's more expensive, but it's the only way to cancel without a potentially long squabble with an insurance company and possible denial of your claim.
Which begs the question: How does a president manage to restore something as ephemeral as hope anyway, especially when the promised change has never been delivered?
Shields is coming off an impressive performance last weekend when she defeated three-time world champion Mary Spencer, 27-14, in the finals of the American Boxing Confederation's Women's Elite Continental Championship in Cornwall, Ontario. Before battling Spencer, a Canadian who lives in Windsor, Shields out-pointed another world champion, Roseli Feitosa of Brazil, 29-11. Feitosa had moved down from a higher weight class.
We tend to forget the many negative externalities of driving so much: noise, congestion, accidents, parking, climate change and laziness. Rather than drive their children to and from school, parents could volunteer to lead a walking school bus—picking up children along a route to walk to school together. Oil is valuable -- we should save some for future generations.

The widow and mother-in-law of a Pakistani man killed by a CIA contractor last year were killed Monday, allegedly by the widow's father who may have feared she would remarry and take the “blood money” she received with her, police said. The families of the two men killed by Raymond Davis in Lahore last January received hundreds of thousands of dollars in exchange for pardoning the killer, a common legal practice in Pakistan. The money normally goes to the wife if her husband was killed.

Eventually the team -- which includes general manager David Hridel and executive chef Marc Caterina -- plan to extend the hours.
As good as most of the sampler was, the entrees were an upgrade. Bubba's patented boneless pork sparerib steak was a wonder of moist, tender, smoky goodness. Batter-crusted sweet potato fries were crunchy outside, fluffy and sweet inside. A juicy, whole smoked chicken looked like more than enough to satisfy any 300-pound lineman. Our dining companion's St. Louis ribs also scored a touchdown with their moist, meaty goodness. Try to get there early on the weekend. But if you can't, Bubba's is worth the wait. -- Bob Migra, Special to The Plain Dealer
Travis Zajac, who scored the winning OT goal, was hurt when Marcel Goc landed on his legs after a faceoff with 5:45 left in the second period. He walked off the injury, which he said was not his Achilles, in the runway leading to the dressing room and was back soon afterwards.
“Matty's in a good place in a lot of ways,” Showalter said. “He's seeing the ball well, letting it travel, putting a lot of good at-bats together. When he makes them throw the ball in the strike zone, he's pretty lethal.”

Along with a quirky wit, the movie also has an engagingly mechanical approach to magical objects, which include a 3-D wanted poster, a treacherous "whomping tree, " an animated map of the school grounds that Harry uses to track his foes and a hybrid bird-horse that Harry learns to fly under the tutelage of giant groundskeeper Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane).

''In consideration of that, I ask the public to not judge anyone, and allow all parties to work things out in a respectful and dignified manner, and if these matters do go to court than only that final decision past appeals, etc should be considered a definitive statement on 'guilt' or 'innocence'.''

The council's unanimous vote Monday to decrease the number of meetings is a sign that the five elected officials are willing to work together to save the city money, Edgar said. Council meetings in Los Alamitos often are contentious and lead to 3-2 divided votes on important matters.
Talk from Democrats has ranged from cautious optimism to outright swagger. Given how quickly tables turned on overconfident Republicans, the former is probably more prudent.
Or consider her chilled, lightly pickled cucumber stuffed with beef, an interpretation of the banquet dish oiseon, transformed by its purity of favor and its utter freshness. Imagine ddukbokki, Seoul's famous street-food noodles crisped and moistened with garlic and soy instead of sweet chile goo. Or jeon, the egg-battered, often-soggy pancakes usually found among the banchan (small side dishes), before the meal proper, served as a course in their own right: light, crunchy fritters of sliced lotus root, sweet potato and maybe oysters or squid. There are also round jeon stuffed with minced Wagyu beef, ginseng tendrils protruding like banjo necks.
He no longer throws fits in the kitchen the way he famously used to - he got fired from the French Room in Dallas for getting into a shouting match with the maitre d' in the dining room - but his line cooks get a thrill seeing an old master at work, even on the slower days during the week.
_ "Edward Scissorhands" (1990): Burton and Depp's first film together and one that still strikes a wistful, poignant tone after all this time. I still can't decide whether this fairy tale is sweetly dark or darkly sweet. Either way, Depp is delicate and lovely as the misunderstood title character, the creation of an inventor who died before his work was complete, leaving Edward to fend for himself in the outside world with scissors for hands. While many initially fear him as a monster, he's actually a gentle creature who falls hopelessly in love with Winona Ryder's idealized, fair-haired teenager. Burton's candy-colored vision of suburbia finds just the right satirical tone, and the ending gets me every time.
The blurring is also evident in the organizations' upper ranks. Panetta previously served as CIA director, and that post is currently held by former four-star U.S. Army Gen. David Petraeus.
"Through hard work and an imaginative vision, Herb Ritts fashioned himself into one of the top photographers to emerge from the 1980s," Paul Martineau, associate curator of photographs at the J. Paul Getty Museum, who created the exhibit, said in a press release announcing the show.
A. In the urban areas, they have only 13 public libraries. People will drive to the library. Cleveland is a walkable city. Every library is so important. Many people, if they couldn't walk to a library, they couldn't come.

The 6-2, 220-pound Notre Dame wide receiver was suspended in March 2011 after he was arrested for a DUI, his third alcohol-related offense in two years. A year later, he became an Arizona Cardinal with the 13th pick in the NFL draft.
But he also wrote that News Corp. would hand over "every piece of evidence we find" of wrongdoing at the tabloid, and other British papers, to the police. "Illegal activities simply cannot and will not be tolerated—at any of our publications… We cannot protect people who have paid public officials," he added.
What is network neutrality ? One easy example is how phone companies treat calls. They can't block some and allow others, or base prices on who is calling or what they say.
"Over the last three years, the tide has turned," he declared. "We broke the Taliban's momentum. We've built strong Afghan security forces. We devastated al-Qaida's leadership, taking out over 20 of their top 30 leaders. And one year ago, from a base here in Afghanistan, our troops launched the operation that killed Osama bin Laden. The goal that I set - to defeat al-Qaida, and deny it a chance to rebuild - is within reach."
Killer apps: Loaded Velvet Cantina nachos ($7.99) come extra-meaty with the addition of chorizo and make for great, greasy, alcohol-sopping fare. Ceviche salsa ($5.99) comes with baby shrimp and tortilla chips -- a bit lighter than the nachos, but zesty enough to stand up to the drinks. For entrees, avocado cactus enchiladas ($9.99) make for a deliciously green vegetarian option, while the chile verde ($10.99), while also green, is all about the pork.

A: Well, he is still dead. But no, what happened was I was sitting at a restaurant and looked across and saw a tabloid newspaper with the headline "James Brown is dead," so I took that, the same font and everything, and just cut it out of these billboard papers. But my thought was, which James Brown? There was the Little Richard James Brown, the I'm-Black-and-I'm Proud James Brown, there was the crackhead James Brown. There've been so many James Browns, I thought, "Which one?"

At some point, it’s not a bad idea to start attaching the same minimum standard to Tannenbaum, who crafted the porous offensive line that caused so many headaches (figurative for Jets fans, literal for Sanchez) this year, who was the one who acquired Holmes and his poisonous personality, who assembled every ruinous piece in the lost locker room that Ryan was forced to answer for at season’s end.

-- Hotels. Some good deals are already available, but major hotel chains seem to be following the airlines' lead in mounting short-fuse promotions. Currently, for example, Hyatt's promotion with AAA/AARP expires in early September, and Accor's current promotion also focuses on summer travel. As with airfares, I suggest you wait for a good promotion. As usual, however, you'll find your very best hotel prices through the flash sale websites (for really upscale spots) and through Hotwire and Priceline. On the other hand, it's never too early to book a vacation rental. Although prices can be highly seasonal, rates for the year are set and published far in advance and vacation rentals seldom run any short-term promotions. The earlier you buy the wider choice you have.

Me, I like to laugh as much as the next guy, but I'm pleased that Miller-Heidke and collaborator Keir Nuttall aspire to something higher than the comedy circuit. Nuttall is a conservatory kid, too, and judging by his productions for his singer, he digs King Crimson and Yes as much as he likes Kate Bush. On "Curiouser," the pair shot the works, decorating every track with synths and six-string overdubs, and all the funny voices Miller-Heidke could coax out of her throat. The album scared off listeners allergic to elaborate arrangements, which might have been part of the pair's sinister plan for smart-aleck world domination.

But they are also working to make certain that Americans have the energy they need in the meantime.

Tim Brown, Yahoo! Sports: "The contract came from the usual mist of a Boras free-agent pitch, with franchises rumored to come and go into the final frantic moments. It would be the Washington Nationals, or the Texas Rangers, or the Baltimore Orioles, or the Seattle Mariners, or somebody, maybe even the Los Angeles Dodgers.

The latest study establishes that despite safety concerns about this class of drugs for such patients, the medications are used by many in the wake of a heart attack. Of 83,677 Danish heart attack patients followed in the study, 42.3% received NSAIDs from Danish pharmacies, which keep records that allowed researchers to piece together each patient's medication history. In all, 35,257 of those patients had a repeat heart attack or died.

Among the most significant problems identified in the report was the failure of all but three of the state's 102 county circuit court clerks to report cases of people being found seriously mental ill to the Illinois State Police. Those people should be placed on an ineligibility list for FOID cards or should have them revoked.
Since the federally mandated switchover in 2009, however, local stations have been ramping up their multicast offerings. Most broadcasters have enough digital bandwidth for one high-definition channel — that’s where the big network affiliate goes, like KMBC at 9-1 — and up to two additional channels in standard definition, such as Me-TV at 9-2.
The 400,000-student system is grappling with a $970 million loss in state funding since 2008, with further cuts expected. Administrators have raised tuition and slashed staff, and are freezing enrollment for spring and discussing cutting programs.

Carl Moss, 41, of Akron: Trial begins Tuesday on charges of grand theft, theft, passing bad checks, securing records by deception and unauthorized use of a computer. He's accused of defrauding the Cleveland Browns of $64,330 by buying a suite and three club seats with bad checks.
Etta James has, sadly, been in the news a lot lately, with health problems that seem quite serious. For a quick remember of what a powerhouse vocalist she was, in her prime, check out this video of a scintillating concert performance of "Something's Got a Hold on Me," with B.B. King, also in very good form, on guitar.
Close behind: the chipotle oysters, which McMahon described as “great” and Koste called ”dynamite.” And the no-mayo lobster roll, not about to take a back seat to the New England version. And the grilled grouper. Wash it all down with better-than-average lemonade.
The significant participation of Fidel Castro's Cuba in the African independence movement of the 1960s gets a detailed look in "Cuba: An African Odyssey," while the first female president of Africa's oldest independent republic is profiled in "Iron Ladies of Liberia." Like Burnett's film, "Iron Ladies" was made with the full cooperation of the government it portrays and could be seen as one-sided, but with filmmaking money so scarce, it's hard to fault the filmmakers too much.
The changing nature of the campaign is also a boost for Tim Pawlenty, the successful two-term governor of a very liberal state, and possibly for another ex-governor, Jon Huntsman, depending on who he decides to run as.
Paying to use a debit card was unheard of before this year and is still a novel concept for many consumers. But several banks have recently introduced, or said they are testing, debit card fees.

Eugene is Track Town, and the sport has a captive audience. The Twilight will draw a crowd and the fans will be appreciative of the performances in whatever events they occur.
Less successful was English's version of surf and turf ($36), the crossroads between steak and seafood. It's something of a signature dish for him, cutting a pocket into a strip steak and stuffing in blue cheese and fried oysters. These are some of my favorite foods, so the combination held great promise. But the meat was lukewarm and the oysters were close to room temperature, which isn't a pleasant state for fried oysters. What should have been three aces turned into a losing hand.
Olivier's question was just one of many to arise this week after the state Department of Public Safety launched a criminal probe against a Hutchinson officer, placed a state trooper on leave and suspended the state's Drug Recognition Evaluator (DRE) program, a staple of law enforcement training that's been around for 20 years.

"I wanted them to be related. I didn't want the cattle-call feel of a lot of wineries here," says the 57-year-old Ms. Fleming.
Time tends to heal all wounds. And Coleman herself admits that some president after her will probably put the banners back up at Crisler. But why delay it? The wounds have healed. Enough time has passed. The Fab Five doesnt have to be celebrated or honored. There was plenty of bad to go along with the good.
It isn't done at the Lark in West Bloomfield, which is known for its service. "We are firm believers in having things written down. No matter how good a restaurant or how good a server you are, there's still room for human error" when people rely on memory, said manager Adrian Lark.

Other Italianate dishes include two hefty slices of Milanese-inspired Lamb Shank ($26) that are tender and meaty, but have a wan taste slightly boosted by a sharp citrusy gremolata and somewhat forgiven by the bravado of plump butter-browned goat-cheese gnocchi. House made Butternut Squash Ravioli ($17), in a chunky chestnut ragout thick with wild mushrooms and scattered with Brussels sprout leaves, should be a perfect comfort on a blustery night. If only the pasta was a bit less doughy and a little more done.

This is the second major brush fire in southern New Jersey in less than a week. Last week fires burned 400 acres in Winslow Township, about 20 miles southwest of Monday's blaze. Officials have said those likely were set deliberately.
"The biggest problem I have is the fact they want to be allowed to grow (outside) in residential neighborhoods," said Lake County Supervisor Rob Brown. Many cities prohibit outdoor marijuana growing because it attracts theft and the smell can be powerful, even sickening to some people.
Lithium ion batteries, the type found most often in portable devices, are made up of three main components -- an anode, a cathode and electrolyte. 3M's new product is a silicon-based anode that replaces graphite anodes now on the market, Milker said. The increase in power and capacity results when the silicon anode is paired with a specialized cathode 3M previously developed and has been making for several years, he said.
In those plans, however, was not losing Fabick. Given the task of sticking with Emde, he was called three times for fouls that led to an exclusion, similar to getting sent to the penalty box in hockey.

Gov. John Kitzhaber has already helped by reinvigorating TriMet's leadership, but now the governor must keep the pressure on. And even though it likely can't happen in this session, Kitzhaber also needs to pursue legislation to make transit operators no longer subject to binding-interest arbitration, a process that tends to polarize and paralyze -- just when speed and moderation are imperative.

Questions to ponder while wondering if the Blues can avoid a home-ice letdown after such an excellent road trip:
By noon Thursday, the scene outside the Prince Street building whose basement was to be searched was a hive of police and curiosity-seekers, some of whom remembered the fear that ran through the neighborhood after Etan's disappearance. Etan was declared legally dead in 2001, but nobody has been charged in the case.
Another issue in the differing reports is the time period each examined. The Forrester stat basically compared sales in the month of January with those in June, while comScore and Piper Jaffray used year-over-year comparisons. Music sales tend to be highly seasonal: Major music releases are sparse in the first half of the year, and song purchases spurred by Christmas gifts of music players tend to level off after January.
It was baseball's 21st perfect game and first since Philadelphia's Roy Halladay threw one against the Florida Marlins on May 29, 2010. It was the third in White Sox's history, joining Mark Buehrle against Tampa Bay on July 23, 2009, and Charles Robertson against Detroit on April 30, 1922.

Aardman, those meticulous Brits who build clay models and painstakingly animate them into Wallace and Gromit cartoons, miss the boat with this animated outing. "Pirates" is stuffed with big-name voice actors (Hugh Grant, Salma Hayek, Brendan Gleeson, Imelda Stanton, Anton Yelchin and Jeremy Piven), but it's a movie that's entirely too late to the pirate party to offer much in the way of fresh gags. The plot centers on a lackluster pirate captain (Grant) who manages to capture Charles Darwin and who is then talked into setting sail for Britain by Darwin. Though it's amusing in small doses, this is the first Aardman film to suffer a serious shortage of sight gags, the first where the whimsy feels forced and the strain shows. Rated PG; mild action, rude humor, language. 1 hour, 28 minutes. By Roger Moore.

One of the few bright spots in Saturday's loss was the offensive play of center Ryan Hollins, who made his first start of the season. The 7-footer has played his way out of the rotation several times, so let's call his 15-point, seven-rebound effort what it was: a good game. He has rarely played with Kyrie Irving this season, but they were an effective duo against the looser than creamed corn Wizards defense.

A rare strain of E. coli -- O104:H4 -- on sprouts produced in north-western Germany killed about 30 people, including one in the United States, and sickened more than 3,000. That outbreak -- with a record death toll -- had an unusually high number of people suffering from kidney failure. E. coli O104:H7 has never been reported in the United States and has rarely been seen abroad. But E. coli are always changing, offering the potential to mutate into deadly strains.

Maybe the problem lies not with the two political parties themselves, but who did the grading. Let’s look at some of these graders. The first one was Cumberland County Public Safety Director James Matlock. His job was at stake. Can he make a fair assessment? The next grader was a fire chief. This would have been all right if he was grading at the fire academy school, but not a 911 department head position. Two other freeholders were involved in the grading system. They certainly are going to be biased, that’s for sure. Professional staff members ... what professional staff members? This whole grading system stinks to high heaven.

Thomas’ ratio of 27 touchdowns to five interceptions — two of which went through receivers’ hands when the Ducks faced WSU — far exceeds those of Foles and Price. “I’m not really worried about who’s rating me or anything like that,” Thomas said. “I’m just worried about getting wins.”

Still, is seems that migrants may not need Homeland Security to tell them just how dangerous it is out there. The path to the U.S. border is fraught with violence. Last year, more than 100 corpses were uncovered in mass graves in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Many of the victims were believed to be Central American migrants headed north. A year earlier, 72 migrants were kidnapped and killed in the same area. Drug cartels are increasingly blamed for much of the bloodshed.

But there are many hurdles. The scope of the obesity problem is much larger than tobacco ever was: It touches on the food we eat, the beverages we drink, the amount of television we watch, how much we exercise, the way our cities are designed and more. While the variety of policy changes proposed are therefore broader, the political will to enact them has not materialized, in part because "people don't yet perceive a significant personal threat," said William Dietz, director of the division of nutrition, physical activity and obesity at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Yet, even with a resilience built over nearly two centuries as outsiders, church members are anxious about what's ahead. Republican Mitt Romney is about to become the first Mormon nominee for U.S. president on a major party ticket. That will give them a chance like no other to explain their tradition to the public, but the church's many critics will have a bigger platform, too. And the vetting will take place amid the emotion of what may well be a nasty general election.

The broadcasters likely will treat it as an afterthought, but this is an area where CSU could have an advantage. Murray State is only plus-1.8 in rebounding margin. The Racers allow an average of 11.7 offensive rebounds per game. That should benefit CSU's Pierce Hornung, a junior forward who has 86 offensive rebounds this season. He likes to live on the glass, getting extra possessions for the Rams.

Given that Laffey's best pitch is a sinker, batters are going to be more prone to beat it into the turf. He will start the majority of his sinker/slider/changeup/two-seamer combination over the plate, so as to allow for movement down and to either side. If he started the pitches off the plate, they would be obvious balls and batters would not be enticed to swing.

I’ve got a couple of iPods in drawers around the house, and I’ll doubt I’ll ever replace them; after all, my phone’s got a music player built right into it. Truly miniature music players will keep selling, given they’re fun for working out, but others will likely become relics.

Cha moved from Anaheim to Fullerton in 1995. Over the years, he's decided not to dwell on what's not coming back.

Piecemakers. A 26-member group of Bible-spewing, denim-wearing quilters who have chosen as their Earthly deity an octogenarian who makes one hell of a custard tart but doesn't know Aquinas from Aqua Net.

Yes, the injections have to be repeated (typically once or twice a year), and sometimes in places that may give you the willies (armpits, bladder). But the shots are way faster, easier, cheaper and safer than surgery, which often has been the only treatment, if there even is a treatment.

The center began to ease its ties with the Go! Network last year as it became clear that supporting the needs of the unemployed in a lengthy jobs crisis would detract from its core mission.
Sadly, that satisfyingly romantic, truly Gothic sort of love story seems to have gone out of fashion.
“We’ve asked the question because of the velocity, how do you feel physically?” Cashman said. “He’s always felt fine. The answer has always been good. In terms of his mechanics, everything else like that, the only thing that has obviously been a red flag has been the velocity.”
Because Taylor Swift dresses in purple pastels and perpetually wears a astonished smile, her punch takes listeners by surprise. Swift is, as she told a Madison Square Garden audience she drove to the verge of pandemonium Monday night, a hopeless romantic. She’s also awfully combative. Her love stories have bad guys and girls, and triumph over these adversaries is a large part of what she’s selling so successfully. This is a young woman who’s taken Shakespeare’s "Romeo and Juliet" firmly in her tongs and banged the ending into a shape that better fits her all-American optimism (and her desire for victory). She rides off with the prince, the diamond ring and the moral high ground that comes from sticking to your guns when those around you demand compromise. She wants it all — the emotional turmoil and the rebel cred, the glory and the thrown garter — and she’s willing to fight to get it.

Bucking bales 11 hours a day at a ranch near Soledad, they share quarters with the cowboy Slim (a deft turn by Chad Deverman), the callous Carlson (Michael Ray Wisely) and the kindly old Candy (Gary Martinez), who lost a hand working on the farm and got $250 in compensation. The ranch hands have been hardened by their way of life, but still try to eke out a few moments' pleasure. They play cards, tell tall tales and gawk at the boss's daughter-in-law (Lena Hart) -- the only unnamed character in the story -- while avoiding her hotheaded husband, Curley (Harold Pierce).

At about the 32, safety Avery Patterson had Mariota cold but clearly slowed up and lazily stuck out an arm as Mariota zipped past him. What should have been a 10-yard gain ended up being an 82-yard phantom touchdown run. Even if Mariota had broken a true tackle attempt or even cut back against Patterson, any extra move or hit would have allowed pursuit to catch Mariota. Instead, he ran untouched for a touchdown.
And consumers, worried about what was happening, wanted to know whether Willamette’s products were safe.
Anyway, looks like Robiskie's case is getting a trade.

But when you add it to the stories his three siblings share about their ‘‘battles'' growing up or hear about some of the scraps he got into at school, it's easy to see that all the edginess and agitation that Blackhawks fans have come to love in Shaw always have been part of his makeup.
The onetime boy wonder -- all of 14 when he signed on as vocalist for the Spencer Davis Group -- will turn 64 on Saturday. But you'll still find a raw ebullience in the vocals as Winwood tackles a career catalog versatile enough to include the garage-y R&B of "Gimme Some Lovin' " alongside the synth-sweetened polish of "Higher Love."

Unless you're cruising Prince William Sound or the Weddell Sea, it's likely you'll run into beaches and snorkeling trips. So how do you keep valuables (including watch, ID and ship-board card key) safe while in the water? The Wet Safe by Design Go is a fanny pack built like a diver's dry bag, including the same roll construction and a zip-like seal. It's big enough to hold a wallet, a cell phone and an iPod, but that's a lot of gear to trust to a rubber bag. In a bathtub test, it kept my cell phone dry after 20 minutes submerged.
Luke Hochevar (2-1, 4.98) pitched 6 1/3 innings for the win. The Indians beat Hochevar on April 13, the Royals' home opener, by scoring seven runs in the first inning. Santana eventually knocked him out of the game by lining a drive off his left ankle.

In fact, if youre going to try to rationalize a stupid action by an athlete over the last week, youd have a much easier time doing it with Amare Stoudemire. Following the Knicks' 104-94 Game 2 loss to the Heat, Stoudemire punched the door that held a fire extinguisher and cut his hand. Reports still vary on how serious the cuts are, but he clearly wont play Thursday in Game 3 in New York and hes probably done for the series, which means hes probably done for the season. Stoudemire was immediately branded stupid, selfish and guilty of an unforgivable act.

Together, these narcissists will manufacture a drama that will undermine the conference and NBA Finals, the NBA draft and Fourth of July parades in small towns and big cities across America. James and the Cavs lost Game 6 of the conference semifinals to the Boston Celtics, 94-85, but he hardly seemed devastated in the losing locker room. James had a triple-double that was devalued with nine turnovers. He shot 44 percent for the series, turned the ball over 27 times and behaved like a lousy leader.
He could argue passionately, knowledgeably and without rancor.
Harvey has been a public artist, a conceptual artist, a sculptor, a photographer and a printmaker -- sometimes all at the same time. His career has been a prototype for a rising generation of platform-agnostic artists who choose the medium best suited to their ideas, rather than identify themselves specifically by their favorite mode of expression.

The last walk was issued in a northern California courtroom.
All in all  a very entertaining day. You had outstanding pitching from both Verlander and Jon Lester. You had two of the power teams in the AL going at it. And you got a Tiger win. Theres nothing to overreact to (as the fans did with Leyland). And theres nothing to yuk it up about (like Cabreras misadventures at third base). As Opening Days go, you cant have asked for much more. It should be a nice harbinger for the next 161.

But the criminals who are creating the high gun violence rates don't have permits, nor are they concerned in the slightest about getting one. Restricting permits does not affect them in the least; in fact, to some degree it benefits them by telling them that their intended victim is probably unarmed.
So, quite literally, yes, Mariota won the day. But does Saturday's empirical data carry any extra significance?
The most significant injury was to redshirt sophomore WR Timothy Wright. Wright, after a terrific spring was expected to claim the starting receiver spot opposite of Mohamed Sanu. Wright was lost for the season with an ankle injury before hitting even started. The injury left the position wide open for a sleuth of young players.

øI would say it is not fair and it is fair. Our sport is such a wide range of athletes. If you constantly pick who you think is going to be the best people to compete, nobody's ever really going to get the chance … Just like me in 2004, if they would've chose who was the best, I don't think they would've chose me that year. But I made the team, so it's a love-and-hate thing.

The company and its unions say they are in good-faith negotiations about pension changes, but clearly some reductions are coming and some jobs will be lost. But the unions want investors, creditors and other stakeholders to share the burden. If the bankruptcy court allows the company to dump its pension obligations, the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. would be on the hook (hello, deficits).

This new federal tactic targets what skeptics have long said was the soft underbelly of state-level medical pot laws: the fact that "prescriptions" can't be filled at a pharmacy. To fill that void, a loose network of growing cooperatives and clubs sprouted in many communities. Some were decidedly casual about whom they served; in response, about a half-dozen states began to regulate the outlets.

Sone shows a creative California flair with "Lissa's Staff Meal'' ($18), clearly demonstrating there's much more to sashimi than knowing how to slice raw fish. The chef makes "noodles'' out of long chewy strips of cuttlefish and mounds them in the center of a burnished origami-like bowl with a julienne of daikon, burdock root stained orange to look like carrots, precise rounds of sliced okra, orange salmon eggs and sea urchin. A quail egg, held upright by a dab of wasabi, is meant to be blended with the fiery condiment, poured over ingredients and tossed. The seductively slick okra, the silky slip of egg and the velvety but chewy texture of the fish play beautifully against the crunch of vegetables. Although there's a lot going on, each flavor is distinctive, revealing a true artistry.

Polites said "it is every coach's dream to win a state title. That's what you coach for and play for. It's just been a dynamic last two years. We got a taste of state last year (when the team was third), of what it was like. When the season started, we had a goal to come back here and see if we could better ourselves."
Brought in to arrange music that had been created for the show, to coordinate it with the dynamics of the live acrobatics, he ended up doing a major rewrite. In 2005 he was drafted to significantly massage the score for "Corteo" after its opening, working with music that had been written by a team of composers to make it better mesh with the action on stage.
When I started this odyssey a decade ago, I quickly made two discoveries: a lot of people didn't know what a pepper and egg sandwich was, and those who did couldn't understand why I was making a fuss about something they had long taken for granted as a staple of meatless Fridays.

The 3-year operating levy would help the 8,200-student district fill an expected $9.2 million shortfall next year, according to the district. At a rate of $1.09 per $1,000 assessed property value, the owner of a $165,000 home would pay about $180 a year under the measure.
I also learned to listen to the masters in their respective fields, from my four mentors in life who guided my career in international investment, agricultural development and publishing to a multitude of both historic and current figures. "It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change," notes a quote attributed to Charles Darwin. What correct-thinking wisdom! There still is so much to learn from the greatest thinkers of current and past times.
The state gets a B for finance because of the simplicity of its funding system, though some education leaders would argue it should get a lower grade for the sufficiency of its school support.

Executing prisoners who "volunteer" by declining appeals is actually good policy. Prisoners, properly advised, may competently choose not to exercise constitutional rights. They have not "volunteered" for the death penalty, that decision was made by a judge and a jury, based on evidence in a courtroom. In a state where we allow competent patients to choose physician-assisted death, and where we allow citizens to decline life support when facing terminal illnesses, how can we decline similar autonomy to prisoners? The governor is concerned that the system is expensive. But that is the cost of protecting the public interest in assuring publicly provided safeguards. And whether that expense is justified arguably needs to be viewed through the eyes of the victims' families. Perhaps, as well, we might measure cost by comparison to a state retirement system that pays a football coach $500,000 per year.
I was disappointed to read "In-state tuition opponents have the signatures for referendum" (July 8). Maryland's new law would have extended in-state tuition rates to young, undocumented residents, but now the law has been blocked, and it will await the decision of the voters in November 2012.

From time to time during the last two years I heard from well-meaning individuals who suggested that I ought to consider running as an independent. My response was always the same: I am a Republican now and always have been. I have no desire to run as anything else. All my life, I have believed in the Republican principles of small government, low taxes, a strong national defense, free enterprise, and trade expansion. According to Congressional Quarterly vote studies, I supported President Reagan more often than any other Senator. I want to see a Republican elected President, and I want to see a Republican majority in the Congress. I hope my opponent wins in November to help give my friend Mitch McConnell a majority.

If there are two weaknesses to Felton, it is his size – the Blazers posted him relentlessly in a November matchup in New York – and his shooting. He is a career 41.2 percent shooter (Miller was 45.9 percent career shooter), which includes a career mark of 33.3 percent from three-point range. He does, however, pose at least a threat from the outside, making a career-high 116 three's last season, which will help the Blazers' spacing.

The No. 2 receiver job is wide open, and the Jets could look to the draft to find their guy. The team is financially invested in top receiver Santonio Holmes, and Jeremy Kerley, a fifth-round pick last year, showed promise as a slot receiver last year. But a young, tall, fast receiver to pair opposite Holmes could be a difference-maker, even in a run-first offense. If Notre Dame’s Michael Floyd lasts until the 16th pick, he could be a great option. But senior personnel consultant Terry Bradway also expects receiver talent late in the draft, and the Jets have shown interest in a handful of guys (Georgia Tech’s Stephen Hill, Wake Forest’s Chris Givens, Northwestern’s Jeremy Ebert) who could be available later.

I ran for president in 2004 and I started going back up because of all the dinners and room service. I was around 240, 250. So two years ago, I said, this is ridiculous. I know I can discipline myself. So I went on a self-imposed diet where I ate salads, chicken and fish and drank coffee and tea. In the last year, I cut that out, no coffee, no chicken. Fish twice a week, salads and fruit. And I'm down to 160, 165. And I feel better. I don't need as much sleep. I look better. Now I don't even have an appetite.
"I think that there are marriages that work with people who have very different emotional styles that complement one another - if they can find ways to work together," he says. "For example, if one member of a couple is highly socially intuitive and the other member is not, the highly social one could be the designated member of the pair who enables their social network and who makes social arrangements for the family, whereas the one who's not very socially intuitive takes care of the house, manages their finances and so forth.
Q. I live in Illinois and regularly attend St. Louis Blues home games. I drive over the Poplar Street Bridge and take the exit ramp to 9th and Clark streets. At the bottom of the ramp is a three-way light that operates on timers and does not have sensors to detect traffic. The green light for traffic on the exit ramp lasts only 15 seconds whereas the green light for traffic on Clark lasts well over a minute. Prior to Blues (and Cardinals) games, traffic backs up on the ramp and requires vehicles to wait for three or four traffic light cycles. These backups occasionally reach all the way to Highway 40 (Interstate 64), which creates a severe safety risk. I believe the city needs to put in traffic sensors at the three-way intersection which would extend the length of time for the green light for vehicles on the ramp, thus improving safety and increasing traffic flow efficiency.
After Congress authorized the visas in 2000, it took the federal bureaucracy two years to implement the program.
