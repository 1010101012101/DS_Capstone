Dealing with teens that have super powers, that means there are special effects to be had. Also unlike some found footage movies that try and hide the supernatural/science fiction elements, this movie glorifies it. That being the case sometimes the special effects can seem a little off, for the most part I didn’t really notice but maybe one or two times I was pulled out by the bad CGI, thankfully thanks to the acting and story I was quickly pulled back in.
How long will it be before the chipping of dogs is hailed as a success in curbing canine crime? We have recently had the absurd spectacle of a dog owner being prosecuted for letting her dog foul the pavement, with the evidence against her being the DNA extracted from the dog fæces! It will surely become mandatory for the dogs' DNA to be logged on the database linked to the microchip. The 'success' of DNA evidence will inevitably be used to justify recording the DNA of all people living in the UK, and of course, will be included in the mandatory ID Cards which we are soon to be forced to have (and pay for ourselves). ID Cards can be lost, so surely it will be logical for ID Cards to be replaced by microchips.

For all the ‘high’ talk we use in churches, talk about sanctification, redemption, propitiation and suchlike (all great and useful words!), talk that make us sound far more knowledgeable than we truly are, we stand in contrast with Jesus who didn’t. Jesus seems to have delighted in ‘low talk.’
And yet, for years I’ve had an on-again, off-again (but mostly off) relationship with running. Because we seem like we’d get along so well, I keep coming back, but to be honest, I’ve never really enjoyed it. Allegedly you can build up your endurance, but mine is always awful.

With gg and Mazui’s many, many awkward lines and generally shitty scripts, I have to recommend Commie for Hyouka if you actually care about the characters and mysteries.

Called "Rauch Geek Breakfast" in the US and "Beer Geek Bacon" here in the EU, this is another tasty treat from the world's favourite "gypsy brewer". It is, as you might expect, a lot like Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast with a bit of smokiness added, though no where near something like Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier.
By the age of two a child should be walking and talking and capable of making simple decisions as well as using their own creativity to play. They will also have high socialization skills which will influence how well they will get along with others. If a child is already shy this will continue however they won't see everyone as a scary person but just a little intimidating.

Arriving: Parking is very expensive, there is an SLDC car park on the edge of town which doesn’t have a card machine, and accepts coin and mobile phone payments. There doesn’t seem to be any public parking in the town itself. We first stopped off at another pub first, which seemed to have a reasonable menu, at a reasonable price but when we got inside it was rather busy and quite small, too small for our large party really, which is why we ended up back at this pub. The staff were very friendly right from the moment we walked in the door. There seems to be a restaurant area as well as the pub area; we chose to sit in the pub, it’s a little less formal.
Kadie, I bought your birthday gift last week when the world was still right. I don’t know if I could have kept it a secret from you for three weeks but I was going to try. I couldn’t wait to see your smile. Now I realize that if I don’t give it to you today, I’ll never have the chance. So I’m going to do it here because I can’t live the rest of my life knowing I never gave it to. I’m so sorry; this isn’t how I wanted it to be but this moment is all I have.”
If one is a philosopher as men have always been philosophers, one cannot see what has been and becomes--one sees only what is. But since nothing is, all that was left to the philosopher as his "world" was the imaginary.

Also feel free to provide suggestions of what I can do to spread my overhead – many of my fellow peers will know that writing in and of itself doesn’t pay very well, so I’m going to have to think of other avenues.

When starting a sales career, sales training plays a critical role. Development usually focuses on three key areas, technique, process, and product. Layered over these are marketing components that address networking, prospecting and promotion. Together they form the technical components of sales training. Once mastered, they only improve with practice and repetition.
Ambron’s free product is a step-by-step dashboard that helps users optimize up to three links they want to push up in search results for their names.

For several years, I felt cast adrift. There was so much more left to learn in my iai system. Friends offered ideas to help me out of my dilemma and even opportunities to join their systems, but I was never quite satisfied with their solutions until this past December. I got back together with a fellow student of my iai teacher. He had an advanced degree, faced the same problems, and found his own solutions.
Lydon understands this paradoxical space the band occupies, and he expresses an irritation at the way that the Pistols became iconic in the same dehumanizing, de-individualizing way that all the heroes they sought to tear down had been elevated into some pantheon. Their fashion and sound was instantly co-opted into a uniform sort of anti-conformist conformist expression, disillusioning the band so quickly that three months after releasing their debut, they crumbled at that bitter, defeated gig at Winterland. It was the most punk thing they ever did, cutting McLaren's marionette strings and effectively announcing the end of punk as a means of true expression just as it was becoming the rage. The Pistols helped kickstart punk in the U.K., and Lydon himself would help announce the next stage when he put out his first album with post-punk pioneers Public Image Ltd. by 1978's end. Compared to this flame out, the Ramones' own tenure as the leaders of U.S. punk really did seem like the "century" they brought to a close in 1980.
It is of the angels at Mamre, who represent the Trinity: the Greek transliterates as “Hagia Trias”, Holy Trinity. Again, it comes from Mount Athos. I bought it in the cathedral at Le Puy en Velay, where a pilgrim offered to pray for me (it is always good to know someone is praying for me).

I watered the spring cabbage seedlings and late brocolli and chard I've not long since planted in the cold frame, and I drenched my tomatoes in the greenhouse. They are just starting to turn red and I'll be able to pick some later this weekend. I noticed my aubergine plants are just flowering... probably a little late, but it's good to see what the flowers look like. I noticed the cabbages are ready to start picking, and celery is growing strong, my brussel sprouts are the size of peas and will be ready for a lovely late autumn/winter harvest, I've got some beetroot big enough to roast, and well... I could write a long long list.
Mr Jefferson appealed for all those concerned about a free and fair election to telephone or email Copeland and Manchester Council, and politely voice their concerns over this matter.
I finally saw Chronicle last night, a movie I’d been wanting to see since its release in theaters but never found an opportunity to. A movie like this appeals to me, both as an adult and as a man-child. The basic plot is that three teenagers find some strange cave and inherit supernatural powers, a fantasy I daydreamed about so much in high school that I could have taught a course on it. The only other thing I thought about as much when I was supposed to be learning was how I would react if a group of highly trained terrorists invaded my school and I was the only one who could stop them.

I don’t want to give you the impression that every item on my prayer list has been crossed off. Nope! There are some people/situations I am still praying for, over the past 9 months. I believe in God’s time, in His own way, according to His will – He will bring it to pass someday. Until then, I will pray.
I can't wait to see what's in store for that old building!
And matter enough to save one’s own:
If you are growing an heirloom tomato variety (as opposed to a hybrid variety), you should collect seeds from your biggest and most beautiful fruit. Since tomatoes have "perfect" flowers, there's little risk of cross-pollination even if you are growing more than one tomato variety. This means your seeds will produce seedlings true to their variety as opposed to a combination of yellow pear and wild cherry.

Tynemouth Castle is located on a rocky headland (known as Pen Bal Crag), overlooking Tynemouth Pier. The moated castle-towers, gatehouse and keep are combined with the ruins of the Benedictine priory where early kings of Northumbria were buried. The coat of arms of the village of Tynemouth includes three crowns commemorating the tradition that the Priory had been the burial place for three kings.

Beyond the fourth inner planet and closer to the star than the first gas giant there remained a region of planetesimals which failed to form into a unified planet because of the gravitational effects of the large gas giant nearby. A few billion years later, the sentient and observant inhabitants of the third planet from the star would call this the "asteroid belt" and they would wonder if it might be the remains of a planet which had blown up, either by natural causes or as a result of the invention and use of a massive explosive device invented by the long-deceased inhabitants of that once-upon-a-time planet. These folks also named a similar formation beyond the outermost gas giant the "Kuiper belt." Sentient but not very imaginative, huh? Why do they have a thing for belts?

So Game of Death II isn’t actually a proper Bruce Lee movie. The filmmakers might say it was done as tribute to him but the majority think it was more of a shameless cash-in on his name. The Bruce Lee footage on show here is leftover material taken from his other movies and 2 doubles (Yuen Biao for the acrobatic fights and Kim Tai Chung for the rest) takes his place in the new footage shot. So I would advise viewers to forget about this being a Bruce Lee movie. To be perfectly honest, once the footage of Bruce has finished and his character Billy Lo dies from a dart to the neck, the movie actually gets better and is actually a very good martial arts movie although the plot is barely passable. For those who just want to see the martial arts that won’t really matter. This movie is in fact better than the first Game Of Death which was a bit of a mess. There is one laughable sequence which is simply embarassing to watch and that’s Bobby Lo being attacked by what’s supposed to be a lion (but it’s obviously a man in a lion suit). Did the filmmakers actually believe they could get away with that and that people would think it was a real lion? With Yuen Wo Ping as the fight choreographer you know you’re gonna get some great stuff and this is true in this movie especially during the climax as Bobby makes his way into the underground Tower Of Death which looks more like a villain’s lair from a James Bond movie and has to fight the various opponents on offer there. Kim Tai Chung does OK as Bobby Lo. Hwang Jang Lee makes a very good villain so it’s a pity you only really get to see him at the beginning and the end of the movie.

At this point, Brian is still using his "Dwell Time," finally fully granted. There's a chance he will not deploy after all, this year, and maybe for the next. It's almost too much for me to believe. I talked to him this morning, and he admitted that last night was a tough night. "There was a lot of emotion in the room," he told me.

For the teams and the students at the university the ability to run these cars, make set up changes and then feel the effect physically and in the data, make this realistic solution. Going forwards the simulators can be linked to other systems, a four post rig so you have both the real car and driver in the loop. Even linking the simulator over the internet to other Cruden systems or even racing several cars, it’s all technically possible. For now the students can start to learn the basic skill sin driving and engineering with this powerful tool.
Looking at my bookshelf the other day to find a great text on Yom Ha’atzmaut, the joyous birthday of the state of Israel, I realized something: Yom Ha’atzmaut is not a day about texts. There’s no Talmud Tractate on Yom Ha’atzmaut. No Torah portion about the State of Israel. This might seem obvious, but being that books are such a major part of Jewish life, and that Israel, too, is a major part of Jewish life, you’d kind of think: shouldn’t there be something?

The good thing about this spice blend is that it is salt-free, so you can control the amount of salt that goes into the recipe. The allspice, cardamom, and cloves go well with the sweet flavor of fish, but I bet this recipe would make an awesome brisket rub too!

If you take too much aspirin, too many sleeping pills, too many pain-killers, too many of any medication, it will likely kill you. This is why directions for their use are printed on every bottle. Substances like arsenic can be found in potatoes, but the amount of arsenic is so low that its ingestion poses no threat whatever. Moreover, our bodies possess organs that clean such substances from our bodies and evacuate them every single day.

That’s why the effects of conditional cash-transfers are so interesting. For example, in Somalia, “Oxfam is implementing a life-saving cash transfer program that will assist around 66,000 highly vulnerable displaced people to meet their basic food needs, enhance their coping mechanisms, and reduce their vulnerability to future shocks.” Sometimes throwing money out of a plane actually works. Other times… not so much.
I had purchased a really great book at Joann's the other day for making candy. So I decided also to pick two recipes to make today. This book I love because unlike all the gazillions of cookbooks I have this one pretty much has every recipes that I would definitely make and they are relatively simple and not too many ingredients.

There are gaps in the story of events leading to Mohamed’s death which raise unanswered questions. I don’t have every detail, but I want to share what I have read and heard with you. I believe it is important that we examine these facts, if only for the sake of his family as they contend with their grief. This is my own interpretation, and may need editing or updating to provide a more complete and accurate account.
Tip #3 Choose healthier popcorn toppings – use lower sodium popcorn - instead of adding salt or a popcorn salt - try adding a salt substitute such as a low sodium seasoning or a salt free popcorn seasoning. This will help turn an otherwise high sodium snack into a much more heart healthy snack.
Just as a street lamp lit, she walks by. Her stride is poetic, she wears a dress a few inches above the knee. She wears no slip beneath it because I can easily see the shape of her body. Her hair falls just near her lower back and her nails are long. She removes her shades and tucks them in her handbag as a car drives past, a young boy whistles at her. She doesn’t even acknowledge this most common distraction that she must encounter throughout her day. But as she nears the midpoint of my window just below, something happens.
Without a doubt, one of the most unique things about Bastion is its real-time reactive narration. Eliminating the need for extended cut-scenes, Rucks narrates everything as it comes without disturbing the flow of battle or the wonder of exploration. It’s unlike any narrative technique I’ve ever seen before in a game, and one thing that particularly struck me was how you can only find out certain things by willfully destroying the remains of people caught up in the Calamity.

DOOMSDAY doesn’t do too much messing around as the first building they enter they’re quickly attacked by the Marauders (the Mad Max refugees). The Marauders attack style is to show up in massive numbers, scream, yell, charge, and die.

Do you want to see a Bible example of loving your enemies? Here it is, David’s own son has rebelled against him. He has fought against him, but when it comes time that his son is killed, David mourns and weeps for Absalom. Yes, Absalom was his son, but he was also his enemy. Absalom would have killed David if he had the chance, but David didn’t want Absalom to die no matter what he did. That is a good picture of what it looks like to love your enemies.

And, yes... I took some time for myself this weekend (thank you , Sweetheart!) You might know that I have done some scrapbook design, teaching, writing, etc... and that I stopped scrapping over a year ago. Yesterday, I was THRILLED to take a mixed art media class at Ever After Scrapbooks from Australia's own Sherry Mendoza. I met Sherry over a year ago when she was in California and she was responsible for getting a project of mine published back in January in the #1 Scrapbook magazine in Australia, "Scrapbooking Memories." This class helped me fall back in love with "getting my hands dirty" and I hope to have time soon to do some more design work!
Similar Species Although the hill chickadee is the black-capped’s nearest family member, the Carolina chickadee likely will cause the most trouble, especially in overdue summer time when the black-capped’s shiny side edgings are used. Where their varies overlap, the 2 types appear to be each other and they also hybridize, intergrading people. Otherwise, the collaboration of shiny oral cavity, especially in clean plumage, genuine black cap and bib, grey upperparts, shiny side edgings, and pinkish factors and flanks should identify the black-capped from other types.

Federal officials delisted wolves in the Northern Rockies based on Idaho’s commitment to maintain between 518 and 732 wolves. But the governor broke this promise, leading to Idaho’s policy of killing off hundreds of wolves. This gives new unfortunate meaning to the old phrase of “bait and switch.”

As the film ends, it leaves me with a very nice impression. I really liked the movie. I liked it because it was different from traditional, conventional love stories that Hollywood filmmakers and fictional novelists have been making over years, that sometimes bend the reality to the extent of making it impractical. I liked it because it had a lot to do with reality. Being inspired from a true story was the biggest virtue of this movie and it carried on it quite well. Movies like this should be made more often, as it leaves a proper impression on current generation. Life is not perfect, and one should take it as it comes to you. A wonderful film! The music is good and Channing really convinced me that he can act and he can act well. I am definitely booked for his 21 Jump Street, which is yet to release here in India. As for Rachel McAdams, she is always a delight to watch. I have never been disappointed by her performances. But she definitely looks a bit aged in this one. In all those frames with Channing, she quite eminently looks older than him.
to them. These tended to be low paying jobs and there was a demand for subsistence housing. The land in what today is Hell’s Kitchen was significantly owned by John Jacob Astor and his descendants who had relatively recently purchased it for development. As was the practice of the Astor family, the land was leased on long-term ground lease to developers who erected old law tenements whose purpose was to squeeze as many families as possible on to the plot. As a result, the area gained a reputation as a dilapidated slum for the immigrant poor. However, it did house a significant number of predominantly Irish and German families, many of whom moved up from even worse conditions in the five points area near Foley Square. In addition a number of the Gangs from the five points also formed in the area.
My doctor had told me that she figured he would be about 7.5-8lbs but he surprised everyone when he came out at 9lbs, 13oz. He was 21.5 inches long (same as Tristan). He was perfect, looked just like a little doll (still is). Because of his size the nurses started calling him Bruiser which just fit. The scheduled c-section went off without any problems and recovery was soooo much better than with Tristan. Aidan was so much bigger than his big brother though that they had to cut more than my original incision line (about an inch) and now it's off center. Nothing wrong with it, it just bugs me ;)
Oh, and at some point during the day I finished packing. (Almost) all set for the cottage! Yay!
In the movie Facing the Giants, everything is going wrong for the main character, Grant Taylor, a down-on-his-luck football coach who is questioning his beliefs. In one of the scenes, he talks to a man who goes through the halls of the school praying for each individual. The man first comes into Grant’s office and quotes to him the above verse. Upon further questioning by Grant, the man tells him the story of two farmers who needed rain in a dry season. They both prayed for rain, but only one of them went out and prepared his fields for the rain. This story is talking about trusting in God. The farmer who prepared his fields for the rain trusted God to send the rain.
This may sound weird to some, but I take it as a good sign of the magic of a place when successive peoples build their holy buildings on the same sites as their predecessors. The Byzantine Christians were apparently really into this place too.

After two trips around various charity shops, I managed to snag the above books. Elizabeth's Secret Diary, which surely promises all manner of illicit thoughts but is most likely concerned with Elizabeth simpering over Todd. The Chateau d'Amour Collection, which is a three-books-in-one affair detailing Liz and Jessica's adventures as au pairs in the south of France for A ROYAL FAMILY. How ridiculously marvellous! There's also Big For Christmas, a rather battered Special Edition Sweet Valley Twins book which I almost didn't get, but decided to make an exception when I realised that the plot is actually that of Big or 13 Going On 30, starring the Wakefields. Seriously, it's about them wishing they were older and then waking up one Christmas morning to find that THEY'VE MAGICALLY GROWN UP. Francine, you are just the gift that keeps on giving, girlfriend.

But Fetching breathes new life into the story by arming Olivia and her friends with dog training techniques of revenge. Not only is it funny, but it was fascinating seeing how Olivia took the lessons she learned from her dog trainer grandmother and applied them to her peers. The best part is, those techniques totally work and Kiera Stewart described the results of Olivia's efforts exactly as they would happen if this were a real life experiment.
If ‘The whole is greater than the sum of its parts’, why not cooperate on R&D? The financial rewards may not be as large but the sharing of knowledge may make the set targets more quickly achievable. One mechanism of potential benefit is patent pooling to create a commercial vehicle facilitating licensing and cross-licensing of the technologies. This tried and tested mechanism has been at the forefront of the telecommunications sector where 3G technology has been pooled successfully and 3G networks are now standard across the industry. Other examples include the pooling of DVD patents among industry players including Samsung, Hitachi, and Panasonic. Perhaps one reason why patent pools have succeeded is that they create a win-win situation in the process of patenting technology and then marketing it. Even patent owners who lack the means to exploit their patent benefit through the licensing of their patented technology to those able to bring it to market; potential licensees benefit from greater time- and cost-efficient licensing; and all parties in the pool have access to the latest technology which can springboard speedier innovation, in turn conferring benefits on society as a whole.

“B.C. researcher at centre of study that hopes to shock policy-makers into action. A Canadian researcher is at the centre of a provocative new international study that puts an eye-popping price tag on the damage being done to the world’s oceans and fisheries—a cost that could reach $2 trillion a year by 2100—from carbon emissions, over-fertilization, over-fishing and other human impacts. University of B.C. fisheries economist Rashid Sumaila, a leading critic of international fishing policies, is co-editor of the 300-page Valuing The Ocean report released last week at the high-profile Planet Under Pressure environmental conference in Britain. The study, touted as a “unique,” monetary assessment of global ocean health and threats, is the latest attempt by ecosystem-conscious scientists to affix financial value to planetary resources taken for granted in traditional models of economic activity. The idea, the researchers say, is to have citizens and policy-makers experience a kind of sticker shock when “the actual monetary value of the critical ocean services that we stand to lose” is revealed through a scientific-economic calculation. “By stressing the links between multiple marine stressors and the huge value of the vital services that the ocean provides to humankind,” Sumaila said in an interview, contributors to the report “hope to help kick-start decisive, integrated action to strengthen ocean governance and management across all scales, from local to global.”
Most importantly, though, we are talking five years downstream, looking at what were predictable and avoidable flaws in the operation, which were clearly apparent at the time, and about which we were continuously writing.

Skip forward. My son was born, 5 weeks premature. We had boxes of disposables from our baby shower - no one cared that I wanted to use cloth - and no cloth diapers. At the time, I couldn't find any that were small enough for him. I waited patiently and used disposables while he grew. Finally, he reached 7 pounds. Finally, I purchased a few different types and brands of cloth diapers, and I've been building my stash - slowly but surely - ever since.

Oh I'm so excited. We just got a wedding invitation in the mail! The person getting married is a special girl to me, and I can't wait to see her on her big day. The wedding is this summer, and the reception is at the Sofitel - which is actually where my husband and I had our wedding reception almost 8 years ago. The exciting part is that the wedding is 'black tie optional.' Well, my friends, for those of us in the fashion world, that means 'black tie, yes please.' An excuse to get very dressed up and perhaps wear some false eyelashes and red lipstick? I'm in!

Maybe it's me, but I have found that women are so terrible about tearing other women down. Whether it be about clothing choices...being overweight....being too skinny...too much makeup....whether you're a stay at home mom or you're a working mom...it's like women cannot win. Jessica Simpson is a fat load...what? I don't care if she looks extra portly, she's pregnant and happy? Let her enjoy this time in her life without being cruel.
Peter Walker, a director at the widely respected McKinsey & Co. consulting firm, unveiled some alarming findings at the LIMRA annual conference from his two-year study on the insurance industry.

And it’s the same felon who has the idea of the acquisition of Indonesian nationality for foreign player, which also known as naturalization. Actually, the idea is something familiar in sport, like some Brazilian footballers who acquire new citizenship elsewhere, or what the Singapore national football team did. And even some Indonesia-native athletes represent other national badminton team abroad. I reckon the huge attention that the Indonesian team received lately largely goes to Cristian Gonzáles, a Uruguayan who turns into Indonesian citizen. Contrary to the figure of the Malay race we tend to see, his Hispanic posture adds a new dimension, and not to mention with his above-average ability which gives a big contribution to the Indonesian team. Without reducing my respect on how great Gonzáles’ passion for his new country is, or even try to be a racist, my mind recalls this old sarcasm: How hard is it to find eleven good footballers from over 200 millions of Indonesian people, where football has been played for a long period here? Is it that difficult that the football association could only find ten of them, thus, they should add a Uruguay-native striker to make it eleven? That without him, ironically, the Indonesian team couldn’t find the net to make their way through the late AFF Cup semi-final against the Philippines squad?

When they reached the point they could no longer follow, and Papa courageously and graciously went on on his own, Nanny and the rest of the family watched him go, their tears and each other being the only things to sustain them. When they could no longer see him on the horizon, they just stood there, staring blankly, not quite sure what to do. When they looked around and saw each other, they realized how tightly they were gripping onto each other’s hands. Then they realized they didn’t know where to go. They were lost. Without papa there, they weren’t sure where the marsh was, how far their trip would be, or even if it was worth going back. They wanted to run as fast as they could to get back, where they felt warm, where they felt loved, where they felt whole. But buckets of tears are heavy, and a dark path is hard to navigate.

Unwilling to go back to work, a pair of scruffily-clothed workmen lazily lean back in their booth, one picking his teeth as the other shouts loudly into his phone.

The story gets really unrealistic when the president of a country is ready to sacrifice his kidnapped son to the death ray rather than give in and buy it! And the kid doesn't hate his old man! Personally, if I were that kid I'd already be plotting to take over that miserable country, having Pop "deposed" by a coup and a firing squad. But that's just me.
This is a mock-up for Ekaterina Sedia's Heart of Iron, which is expected sometime this Fall from Prime Books. An official description has not been released as of yet, but the cover does tantalize us with few facts. This is looking more and more like Steampunk, but quite different from what Sedia did with The Alchemy of Stone. The art really captures the imagination, but the grey treatment needs some work around the title. The novel is supposed to be focused on Russia and China somehow. And what is up with the guy in the cape? More news I have it and this reminds me I really need to get around to finishing my review of Sedia's The House of Discarded Dreams. It has to be her weirdest book to date, which says a lot if you've read her other works.
You've bettered my life in so many ways, but one big one is you've made me healthier. I haven't had fast food or anything too "fake" since you started eating with me. You are such a great eater; so far you haven't rejected anything I've tried. Pesto tortellini. Crab-stuffed sole. Turkey meatballs. Chimichurri salmon. Brussel sprouts. Peas. And of course, coconut sorbet.
I guess I should also tell you the basics, like the fact that I was born and raised in California and I'm trying to cut my bad habit of writing all of my stories in California. I'm starting to know Utah better than CA now so maybe I'll set some stories here! I majored in Film at Brigham Young University and my emphasis was production design and makeup. Although I'm complete rubbish at 'pretty' makeup. I can only do special effects makeup. So if you're bored around Halloween time, come and see me!

On the other hand, there are beautiful, women friendly mosques that inspire me and expose me to leaders and scholars that help empower women and allow me to become acquainted with others (women AND men).

Aren’t people regardless of there religion, belief or even if they are athiest, agnostic, regardless of race, sex or sexuality the reason for our existence in the first place? And are they not welcome in our venues and worthy of our service? Heck, a bar, should be a place of great diversity… in my opinion.
Ok, Sunday was quite a special day for MMMay'12 round these parts. Not only did Patty wear TWO Zo-made garments, but one of them was a brand new type of garment altogether!!!!! I'll blog about this in full later this week, but in short: I've figured out how to make dude-pants! Now is not the time to fully express just how exciting and life-changing this new endeavour is for me, but let me tell you that they performed their task well and were worn for the whole day. Patty also wore his Book Launch shirt, which I wasn't expecting him to do because I thought the pants might be enough to concentrate on, but he wore the shirt as well voluntarily.

If any of you are wondering how the job search is going, slow is the word. I have taken on some contract work that is taking a lot of my waking hours. Throw children breakfast, lunches and dinner into the mix means that too few resumes are leaving my computer than I would like. I have been burning the candle at both ends and as a result paying for the next day, meaning I am less productive and then have to stay up late to catch up… a vicious circle.

That said, there was no way that those online could really participate. There was no good way to determine who was speaking during the roundtable discussion and no way to ask questions. These glitches aside, the conversation was candid and polite and quite informative about how different stakeholders view things differently. I wish there had been a ‘Who’s Who’ to figure out which voices were from the journalists and which were from the contracted public relations agencies.

Week 7 at San Francisco: The Seahawks will have a short week of rest after the NE game as they face the division champ 49ers in a Thursday night matchup, their second and final primetime game of the year. Seattle gave San Francisco a run for their money last year as they pulled within two points of the Niners in both games. San Fran escaped both games with wins as they scored two touchdowns on returns in week one and forced a late fumble in week 16. This game could be a statement by either team for becoming the NFC West powerhouse.
Councillor Coleman remains as a Cabinet member, as indeed his Tory colleague Councillor Andreas Tambourides remains a member of the Standards Committee itself, even though he was found to have breached the code as well, at a hearing last year. Both members are appealing against the decision of the committee. Whether or not they will retain their positions should their appeals fail is not known. If the leader Cornelius or indeed any other councillor has made any comment on the Coleman case, Mrs Angry has yet to see it. You might hope that some view would be expressed, perhaps.

I started to watch the girl as soon as Dino hired her. Normally, he had a thing for chicks built like brick shithouses but Drama wasn't curvy at all. In fact, she always struck me as needing an extra sandwich. But still way sexy. She had that thing. Guys'll know what I mean. Body aside, she had a way with the lappers and always got them to pay more for a sweaty crotch grind than the other gals. It was almost beautiful to watch. Drama had them so wrapped that these briefcase bums didn't know what hit 'em. To this day, I always wondered how they explained the stain on their pants to the misses.

It isn't that we don't care, we simply don't know how to help. People who can help include:

There have been business leaders, like Warren Buffet, who I think have spoken out forcefully on this issue. I think some of the folks who participated in the Bowles-Simpson Commission made very clear that they would agree to a balanced approach even if it meant for them, individually, that they were seeing slightly higher taxes on their income, given that they’re — I think the average CEO, if I’m not mistaken, saw a 23 percent raise this past year while the average worker saw a zero to one percent raise last year.

Day 1: Drink fresh juice and nothing but juice. You are allowed to drink as much as you’d like. Fresh juice does NOT count as anything you can buy in the store – no bottled juices (even if they are sugar free) and none of those smoothies that claim to have ultimate health benefits. Fresh juice means juicing it yourself or drinking it freshly juiced at a juice bar. Storing fresh juice will result in separation and fresh juice should be stored for less than 24 hours. So if you are taking a daily stroll to the juice bar, stock up, but not too much. You may need to visit the juice bar twice a day.
4. Clinton Fearon "Sleepin' Lion" 4:33
Plenty of argument arose on the necessity to remove Mick McCarthy from his job following a 1-5 demolition to local rivals West Brom in early March and the question was still being posed to midfielder Karl Henry in the corridors of Molineux as the reality of relegation was still setting in, McCarthy had after all guided his team to just one win in ten and their performance in the Black Country derby was so woefully devoid of any direction or guidance. Logically, just 5 wins in 25 games wasn’t good enough for McCarthy and his six year service of loyalty probably had to end. But, unfortunately for Morgan and Moxey’s gamble, what followed posted McCarthy’s sacking at the top end of the scale of some of the most catastrophic boardroom errors.

But you, my daughter, whom I have chosen for myself, and with whom I now speak in spirit: love me with all your heart – not as you love your son or daughter or parents, but more than anything in the world – since I, who created you, did not spare any of my limbs in suffering for your sake! Yet, I love your soul so dearly that, rather than losing you, I would let myself be crucified again, if it were possible. Imitate my humility; for I, the King of glory and of angels, was clothed in ugly, wretched rags and stood naked at the pillar and heard all kinds of insults and ridicule with my own ears. Always prefer my will before your own, because my Mother, your Lady, has, from the beginning to the end, never wanted anything but what I wanted.

Even those who are retained will either have to get a job or sign on prior to returning for pre-season training on July 1st.

What then is the real reason? Is it the trillions to be made in oil profits, or the trillions in war profits? Is it to bankrupt the U.S. economy, or is it to start World War III? Is it to destroy Israel’s enemies, or to destroy the Iranian central bank so that no one is left to defy Rothschild’s money racket?
Why? I have no idea to be honest. I just am. So much has changed in the last 18 months since I last posted anything - I'm now a homeowner and a proper grown-up. Part of the reason I stopped blogging back in 2008 was that I entered into a rather serious and proper relationship which was so bloody awfully mundane that I had nothing to write about. It was nice but it was too boring and comfortable and yes - he was hung like a baby rhino - but he was so utterly sweet and kind and boring and I realised a year down the line that I wasn't myself anymore. I'd become...(almost) someone's wife...and I just wasn't ready. So I dusted off my saucy undergarments and got back out there!
In the London Illustrated News a story on page 268 on Saturday April 23rd 1853 was entitled "Hales Rocket Factory at Rotherhithe and begins, promisingly, "An event of ten days since invests the barren locality, pictured on the preceding page, with extraordinary interest". Acting on information authorities searched the premises in Rotherhithe of Hale's Rocket Factory on the west bank of the Surrey Grand Canal near the Plough bridge. They discovered "a large stores of arms, ammunition, and materials of war". The stores were thought to have belonged to Mr Kossuth and his adherents. Mr Hale himself is described as a "well known inventor" who was working a perfecting a war rocket "which rotates around its axis like a rifle-ball, and carries no stick". The News concludes that the connection between the two men was due to Kossuth suggesting improvements in the manufacture of the rockets to Hale.

Thankfully, I do have one task that’s blog-worthy, which stems from the fact that the Oscars are coming up this weekend and that I’ve been lax in my viewing habits this Oscar season.
"Clearseer! First-Realm logic!" Taslin's shout broke his hypnotised terror. What did she mean?
“Fear not.” “What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops. And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell.” These are loaded verses. Christ tells us that we are not to fear, but to preach, to witness, to proclaim boldly what He has told us. Preach it in the open, even on rooftops. The idea here is that we are not to be fearful and ashamed of the message. We are to shout it out in a world of darkness. Fear not the enemies of God; Christ is teaching us to be more afraid of Satan, the one who will destroy the lost if we preach not the gospel of Christ. Fear not those human enemies of God who can only destroy our bodies. Preach boldly that men and women and children may escape the one who really can destroy them in Hell. This is why preachers must be bold and refuse to be silent. The eternal state of millions hangeth in the balance. The consequence of fearing men is the eternal damnation of souls! When we are rejected, scorned, and even abused, we are not the target of aggression, our LORD is. It is not us the world hates, but Christ whom dwells within us. Let’s get this down. They hate the God that lives within us. We have given them no reason to hate us. “For we wrestle not against flesh and blood.” It is rather a spiritual conflict that we physically feel the repercussions of. When we get this fact that Jesus himself presented His disciples, we will be bolder, more courageous, and more passionate in living the Gospel before the lost world.
It might not be the most spacious environment - it's a far cry from, you know, the Amazon or the Atlantic Ocean - but the baby fish still have all the regular aquarium home comforts of multi-coloured stones, sand and seaweed.
I only had three people try to kill me today. One, however, was a dump truck. Yeah. Talk about scary!! They almost smashed into the car in front of them. Why they just HAD to pass me coming up to a stop sign is beyond me. I still think stuffing my top with rocks sounds tempting, but I have yet to take justice into my own hands. I am valiantly leaving them to Gods judgement; for now.
My name is Jenny.
I met him one day on my way to the Post Office. I did a double take at seeing him outside of the chippers. He was with a guitar player - the two of them busking. The plastic microphone was left at home; they'd all the professional gear. Speakers so their voices could travel all over the city streets. They were between numbers and Mike asked me would I stop and sing a song. I was about to automatically say no, I didn't sing, when I thought, why not? I sang 'Young Ned of the Hills' : 'And he sings lady love will you come with me now/ Come and live merrily under the bough. ' Nerves caused my voice to tremble as it boomed up and down the city street. A passing lady, without looking, threw in a euro. A man came and pushed a mint into my hand as I sang - maybe he thought that I'd a sore throat. I'm not that great a singer - I wonder did the people of Cork all feel like they were trapped, that there was nowhere for them to run, only into the nearest shop, as they scuttled up and down the Grand Parade doing their shopping? Whatever they thought of me, I thought I was great. Mike would want to hold on tight to that plastic microphone - he could have competition for it.

But then, the 'AHA' moment struck; that every person in that room was there for the same reason, and it had nothing to do with page stats, Klout scores, or how many bottles of moisturiser you've reviewed.

Quite apart from the fact that I could point to a hundred or more articles here detailing the tobacco control template being put to use in other areas, I don't really need to. There was a perfect example published just yesterday at the Lancet.
A big reason why I partake in the dweebery of draft-watching is for fantasy football purposes. To me, as the world renowned fantasy owner of the legendary “Juice’s Jackhammers” franchise, it’s essential. Take Trent Richardson for instance. Richardson landed in Cleveland with the third overall pick tonight. He is instant fantasy gold. With his size and speed, and Cleveland’s current talent level, he will be the Browns offense in 2012. Think of Peyton Hillis and his 2010 season and then replace him with a player who reminds me of Ricky Williams with more speed. Before you scoff at the comparison, realize that it’s easy to forget just how good Ricky Williams was at his best. Trent Richardson is faster and stronger. In my eyes he is already deserving of at least a third round ranking on my fantasy draft board. Now that’s dweebery personafied. The point is, I follow not only to keep up with my favorite squad, but I follow to keep up with the depth charts. It could be the difference in me gloriously beating Hank’s Hammerheads or The Freaks of Nature. It’s my duty and obligation to geek out and stay in the know.
The sociological shift to personalization created new opportunities for companies entering new markets (Apple) and startups ceasing a new market share (Spotify, Pandora, etc.). These companies were the ones who could “zoom out” and see that consumers were developing a new expectation that they receive individualized products. Once they identified this phenomenon, they embraced it. They didn’t resist it. They found ways to successfully and legally monetize the fully-customized, “Napster model” of music. There is a reason Generation Y is probably more inclined to associate the name Steve Jobs with music than David Geffen. iAssume you understand why.

Overall, this band delivers the goods! They have a punkie/chunky sound, an intense delivery, and good melodies.I have to say this is an incredible disc. Back in 1997, Steve Perone sent me two seven inch releases. They were intriguing enough to invite Planet Seven into the Pit. ON the heels of the show came an excellent show they did for us in Appreciation Hall, and a fine first CD Pleasure Craft Recovery Theme. their featured on KFJC's Waves of the West CD. I loved the blend of surf and space rock via the Theramin and Hawkwind/punk crunch rhythms. then, along comes this long overdue second CD. It is astoundingly good! The ever changing ominous scenery and liquid green feel are very magnetic. Excellent melodies and crunchy structures. At the top of the must-have list is the stunning Hawkwind surf treatment of Johnny Barakat and the Vestells' "Long Ride." Truly inspired! - Phil Dirt
I can't wait to figure something out in regards to health insurance while I'm a student and unable to work full-time somewhere for benefits. I'd love to at least have things like this looked at to have an idea of what's going on. I'm in debt as it is from the non-insured doctor visits I've had so far, so I'm going to pursue my options more aggressively next week and figure out what is the least trans-exclusive and, hopefully, affordable.

At this point I also start to question the blog constantly.)

Raw feeders from “opposing” sides will argue about whether dogs are carnivores or omnivores (Dogs are carnivores) even though the definition itself doesn’t matter much. They get stuck into whether wolves eat the stomach contents of their prey and if not whether vegetables should be fed at all. And for me, every time the detail of this is raked over it (conveniently for the pet food industry) makes it much less painful for the undecided owner to stick with opening that bag of kibble.
The resulting urban core sample has the look of a toy oven or vending machine—as if, in the latter case, we could someday just a few quarters into a streetside machine and walk away holding complete miniature rooms, intact down to their ads and posters, extruded from some kind of self-replicating master-model.
In fact, in the comments section of the last Hate Mail post several of my readers went through a bunch of facts about how the Nazis were socialists, just like they said that they were. The response by Hanna was to link to Wikipedia where somebody said they were like totally not. Because if you read it some place on the internet then it totally must be true. Especially Wikipedia, which as everyone knows is never biased or wrong.

My big "regret", if I ever were to hold those, is that I never got the opportunity to give them grandchildren. Infertility sucks when you desperately want a child. Mom had pretty much decided that she would never get any grandchildren. I don't know which hurt more, knowing I couldn't give her what she wanted, or that she had resigned the wanting. Either way, if I ever do have any children now, they will never get to know my parents. And that will be a deficit for my kids, because my parents were awesome people.
The news keeps mentioning the planned commencement of the drawdown of combat troops some time over the summer which was announced by Obama.

You have to make Hungry Tigress' North Indian Lime Pickle. I've never had them with regular limes, so I don't know how that tastes. I'm sure amazing. So, with Rangpur limes, think double triple billion amazing. I am a total wimp, so I followed her directions for not adding cayenne, and upping the sugar. Yeah, I know, I'm lame, but believe me these pickles are still awesome. This is the kind of pickle that is beguiling. One that makes your mouth pucker, salivary glands wake up even when they are behind you, and you can't even see them. That's where they are right now, and I just got up to smell them. Ahhhh.

Amazing what 33 years worth of perspective does for a girl. Today I cannot imagine not having diabetes. It has shaped my adult life, as well as instilled a deep appreciation for each day, well lived. Diabetes has deepened my Faith, drawn me closer to needing God’s direction and impacted how Tim and I live ~ what choices we make in maintaining our bodies in mind and spirit. Diabetes influenced how Stephen and Katie were raised; to respect your body, treating it gently, not adding unhealthy stress, exercising regularly, striving to remain balanced so your immune system has all the help it needs. And that each day is a precious gift.
And speaking of the Greenville News, Sunday's piece on tech colleges offering job training was SHAMEFUL in its lack of reporting and total acceptance of the status quo. It was one long commercial for technical colleges, as their recent piece on BJU's spring opera season was one long commercial for Bob Jones University. Do they even understand the difference between reporting and press releases? Do they have any clue what real newspapers write about? Have they ever seen the New York Times, or even the Spartanburg Herald?

One rather amusing consequence of the way Mussolini made use of the existing power structures was that when Hitler (who in Germany was by that time both head of State and head of the government) first arrived in Italy on a State visit, he was greeted, not by Mussolini but by the King. As protocol requires, the head of government (Mussolini) was on the sidelines. This both confused and annoyed Hitler. It is a good illustration, however, of how Mussolini put pragmatism before ideology, as his 1919 manifesto was explicitly anti-Monarchist.

Maria Menounas looks absolutely amazing…her sparkly white gown is gorgeous and her hair is perfect. I tell you, these hairstylists, make up artists and costumer designers do not get enough credit on this show. I have to say, she seems to also be struggling with her dance, the foxtrot. It definitely isn’t the easiest dance for her and it looks like she’s not as comfortable on the dance floor as she usually is. I do agree that the posture required during this dance can be a bit awkward but it’s definitely showing here. She slips on the stairs and just doesn’t exude her usual confidence. However, she gets plenty of raves from the judges and pretty good scores.

There's just something about that in-your-face-intense yellow color that gets me so excited for spring. I know spring is all about the pastels, but most of the time I feel pretty ick about pastels. This crazy yellow, though, is great. I also love how forsythia grows. Crazy. My friend and I used to have some faux forsythia in a pot in our apartment back in the day. We donned it, "The monster plant". A lot of people trim their forsythia like bushes, but I like it when people let it grow free and wild:

Kathryn’s List of Movies to Not Watch When Alone:
Around 3pm every day I am struck with a snack attack. It is also the time of day I am most likely to make a poor food choice; opting for something salty or sugary instead of anything remotely healthy for me. And it seems every time I opt for a “bad” snack at 3, I let the rest of the day slide and have a not so great dinner followed by a very bad dessert. I’m an all or nothing kinda gal and though I know I shouldn’t, when I screw up and eat something I shouldn’t, the flood gates open and I find myself eating whatever I want for the rest of the day. Now that I recognize that my 3pm munchies are the cause of many of my falls off the wagon, I am making a concerted effort to prepare and snack wisely. I always have carrot sticks, hummus or white bean spread, for example. But for some reason I still automatically gravitate towards salt laden crackers that I can’t stop myself from buying (a different brand is on sale each week! It’s not my fault!). So clearly I need something salty and crispy and easy to grab like crackers. Enter the kale chip: delicious, nutritious, salty and easy to grab! I made a batch yesterday, stored them in a glass container and enjoyed them today when my snack craving attacked!

To start off our blog, we want to share a little anecdote about how we ended up cooking this particular dish: We decided to have a movie night at home and to watch Disney/Pixar’ s “Ratatouille”. Once this was settled, it was almost mandatory for us to cook Ratatouille, that tasty dish consisting of a mixture of mediterranean vegetables. To accompany the Ratatouille, there are a lot of options, but I like Polenta best. I think the two dishes compliment each other well. For those of you who don’ t know what Polenta is, let me try to explain: it is made of dried, ground corn and cooked like grains, for instance rice. I know trying something you’re not familiar with can be kind of a hurdle, but in this case it really IS worth it! So, here’ s what you need for Polenta with Ratatouille (for 2 people):

Human reasoning is walking according to the flesh. How does the Lord look upon this in Galatians 5:16-17? “This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.”
Yes, you can build schools in Lyari, conduct employment generation projects, construct homes for people who had theirs flattened in 2010 floods. All problems are rooted in economics. But again, without a massive creation of livelihoods and government commitment to social security, what can this do but serve as a tiny remedy for a very large and pervasive problem. Its hard not to cave to feelings of hopelessness and cynicism -- and coupled by knowledge that political action is weak and tainted, it seems dire.

Shiny Things does intriguing things too, coming on like dour-period OMD covering Bee Gees' You Win Again before pummelling away into another of those brassy finishes. There's little doubt Fanfarlo want to be big – that's Big Music rather than Coldplay-massive, although the cash probably won't hurt – but they have their limitations. Singer Simon Balthazar is from the 80s indie school of mannered vocals, always a barrier to leaping out of your speakers, and Fanfarlo can't shake that lingering temptation to skip off into twee. Still, one man's limitations are another fellow's charms, and Rooms Filled With Light never dips beneath beguiling. Most of the time it's really quite grand.

I received this very lovely award from The Elementary last week.

It does give you the giggles inside a little.
I think that most kids start out as dreamers, and I believe that most kids would prefer to stay that way. Some people think that allowing kids to dream, at least once they get to school age, is insanity run amok, because dreamers never get anywhere, they just sit and dream all day long and never actually do anything. To such people I simply ask what the world would be like without dreams. Did Martin Luther Kind start out with a specific end state in mind when he wrote his "I Have a Dream Speech", or did he start with a general notion and hope that equality would be better than institutionalized racism? Do the thousands of professional and Olympic athletes in the world start out with a goal of making it in the pros, or simply with a passion to participate and have fun, regardless of their level of skill?
Overall though, I just can't get over how different this pregnancy is than my pregnancy with Lizzy. Some moms I know have told me that their pregnancies with boys were totally different than their pregnancies with girls and visa versa.

I was blogsurfing last week and saw a post about a book with all things handmade and for charities.... the project in particular was kimono style jammies for newborns. She gathered a group together at her church and they all got to cutting and sewing and then donated to a local hospital. WHO WAS THIS??? I don't know. I could have sworn I started following her blog but I searched through all of my lists and cant find her! What I do know is that I saw a link from someone else's site which led me to her..... not much help huh? I feel the same way! Oy! What to do what to do? I'd really like to purchase that book. Maybe I will google kimono style jamjams. hmmmm......

It was narrated that Buraydah (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: I heard the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) say:
The heat they talked about rolled in. We went from nice and comfortable to hot and miserable in one day! We woke up and headed up to the bark park for a little bit of running before it was too terrible out. We walked both sides of the park, and I chased my ball a bit, but the humidity was just building, and I was panting like crazy. Mom put my ball away, and instead insisted I just walk, or play in the prairie grass.
And that is the message for the day. Some will say, “Too much science, Kryon!” Others will say, “Indeed, the beauty of the system of the Creator is at hand.” Dear ones, don’t be turned away with the particulars of the science. You don’t have to know and understand it, but we ask you to celebrate it. For God the creator is the master physicist of the Universe and has used these tools to create the system of life and the balance of love. All of this is going to enhance Human life and Human understanding.
According to Strawson, the imagination is that which represents the ‘nonactual’. It is the synthesis of past ‘impressions’ or past intuitions and future anticipated possibilities that allows for present perceptions to be united by concepts of the understanding. This seemingly pre-eminent role of the imagination would seem to indicate that it has primacy in relation to sensibility and the understanding. But in fact, just when Kant approaches such a move, he backs off in favor of placing the understanding in the more prominent position. Not prominent in scope, for the imagination clearly has a larger possible scope of influence. Rather, the understanding’s prominence is qualitative. It has a greater importance in that it plays the key role in cognition’s effort to approach objects of experience truthfully. This is because the imagination is a great source of error. Whereas in his ‘Fourth Meditation’ Descartes describes judgment-errors as deriving from the will exceeding the understanding in haste, Kant would argue that it is the imagination, with its tendency towards ‘daydreaming’ beyond the limits of experience, that is the cause of error. Therefore, the understanding is given the role of keeping the imagination ‘in check’. Thus, in the last instant, although the imagination is the grand synthesizer of sensibility and the understanding, it is the latter which truly sets the bounds of the revelry of the imagination and limits cognition entirely within the sphere of experience (§35).

I did mention, in this lost piece, how happy Gary is to finally be on sabbatical for five weeks. He's delirious. Not really, but he is quite happy. Except for last night at dinner. He did get upset with me when I remembered just minutes before the NFL season started that he screwed up our family-league schedule. Hey, it wasn't my fault that I noticed the scheduling problem in the middle of the night, and that this fact didn't stick with me when I got up yesterday. I think he should have seen the problem, since he is the commish of that league. And I am just a lowly league member. Fortunately, he did manage to correct the problem using my cellphone during dinner. (Yes, his phone was out of juice, adding to his consternation). After he solved the dilemma, he got over his upset. Oh, btw, the scheduling problem involved our newest member, John Kaslow (honorary brother for our family league). Gary put John on bye week for the whole season. Which meant he wouldn't be able to actually participate. Well, hi-howdy, John, and welcome to our family league! (Btw, dinner was delish at the Deli (as usual). We had crab-and-shrimp cakes, a sweet corn saute, and a summer slaw, served with a Chardonnay and followed by a lovely custard. Mmmmm, mmmmm, good).

Last weekend, my husband went with me to swim, oh lord… I missed it so much! I didn’t remember how much I love to swim and it made me feel so relax… all the pain in my body disappeared. There’s a weird thing with the pool though… it’s a saltwater pool, so they don’t use chlorine on it, your skin and hair don’t get damaged, but I feel like I have to be spitting all the time, because of the salty flavor it leaves on the mouth… I’ll get over it after a few weeks.

The building of the tabernacle was not a light task. It had certain divine specifications that had to be met in order to fulfill God’s vision for His designated place of meeting. As a result, God handpicked the workmen. Yes, that’s right, He picked each man Himself and placed within them the wisdom they needed to accomplish their specific tasks (Exodus 31:1-6).

Virtually every combatant ship by 1943 had multiple radar systems, and most auxiliaries did as well. Airplanes had surface search and air intercept sets, submarines had search radars, and even periscope mounted ranging sets. Land based units of course had radars as well. Radar was everywhere the Navy went. Not an inch of the surface they sailed wasn’t assailed by trillions of electrons flung out in search of the foe. And today’s reader may be surprised to learn that those sets were very effective. Their range and sensitivity over open ocean would compare quite well even with todays radar systems. Oh, there have been improvements, to be sure. Greater power, greater reliability, and such. But the range of radar hasn’t really improved much since World War II. Physics sets those rules. Radar, for the most part, is a line of sight device. And since the earth is curved, a radar on at surface level has in inherent limit to its range. Toward the end of World War II, the Navy’s prime target was enemy aircraft, particularly the Kamikaze. The range at which a destroyer’s radar detected a Kamikaze was largely a function of the altitude a Kamikaze was flying at. Few Kamikaze raids at Okinawa went undetected. The relatively short detection range of a surface mounted radar against low flying raids led the Navy to station numbers of destroyers as early warning pickets further along the most likely avenues of enemy approach to give more warning time. The Navy was also developing airborne early warning radar systems to better detect low flying aircraft at longer ranges.

On Sunday I ran in the Fayetteville 1/2 Marathon! Going into the race, I was feeling as strong mentally and physically as I ever have! I ran my last 2 long runs(9 mi and 10 mi) at a 6:53 min/mile pace!! I also had a great 2 weeks of tapering(I started a little early due to having graduates school finals)! I was all set to hit a new PR and finish in the low 6:50 min/mile range!
My girlfriend was a powerful, hardworking, woman from a poor background. She had that poverty mentality: work yourself to the bone and never ask for handouts. But what was more stunning was that she had 100 percent trust in me as a parent, as capable of soothing, calming, protecting, loving our son.
Tonight we had spaghetti! It's one of our go-to dishes, and I love that there are so many things you can do with spaghetti! This dish is light but full of flavor. The fire roasted tomatoes, kalamata olives, feta, and goat cheese just work so well together for a light meal. The sauce is such a nice change from the heavier marinara. The pasta water helps to thicken what is really a light juice from the tomatoes until all the other ingredients come together.
Throughout this timeframe I had listed the boat with several brokers. One that I felt more inclined toward, but should not have (he came to me via my troublesome brother-in-law) as it later proved out, had taken inside and outside shots of the boat, was advertising online, etc. I’d had such a time just trying to establish what the value of the boat was for listing, got told insanely high values initially and had such a short season to sell as it was, that by July 3rd I’d advised this broker and others to drop the price by $50K.
All of which makes me nostalgic, because it now looks very much like I'll be leaving here come July. Details -- many, many details, you can be sure -- will follow as things fall into place, and no, I don't have the money yet, and yet it's more likely than ever that I will when the proverbial push comes to shove. The first item on the agenda is an apartment search, which will follow closely after a week in Morocco. After that, it'll be back here to pack.

After a few more rounds of the ol’ back-and-forth, Meghan and Jenn opted for the general idea of the logos in row 5, but with a more traditional feel. They were hoping for one that involved a seal (the emblem, not the marine animal) and a new color scheme of Pantone blue and gold. The next few versions involved subtle (albeit necessary) tweaks to this general design, but I’ll include only the finished product for brevity’s sake. I know you have a bus to catch.

Some of the people I spoke to were anti-South Africa and others were not. That is the way this life is and it’s not for anyone to judge their views. It’s not an easy task to leave your father and mother or brothers and sisters and friends and head off to a new country and make it work for you there, to settle there and have children who will not see their grandparents from one year to the next.
So, you may ask, what am I planning to do next? Well, hell, I can’t even manage to get hired for a simple part-time job, so I have no idea! I’m starting to think it would probably be a really good idea to attend the university I’ve been attempting to transfer to for the past couple of years – watch, if I did, I’d wind up being able to get a decent part-time job. But I mention this because of the prospect of getting a job that pays better than $10 per hour. Hell, because of the prospect of getting a job period! I would suppose that it would be that way not only because of getting a Bachelors degree, but because of the location of the university and the size of the surrounding city. Maybe I should have joined the Coast Guard…
Hope the rest of you are doing good and continue to work hard!
The contemporary re-birth of the assault pack in the enduring fight with the Caliphate is due, almost totally a result of the vehicle-based operations, even for "light" infantry (as I've mentioned repeatedly, calling a fighting force that travels to within two kilometers of the objective in motorized vehicles and then walks the last little bit "light infantry" is ridiculous). When you expect to perform a mission after a one-mile jaunt, then return just as quickly to the trucks, only to be returned to the FOB in time for a meal and bedtime, there's little reason to carry more than a simple day-pack. When a guerrilla fighter has to literally live out of his ruck, with his entire sustenance and shelter only what he can carry for the duration of an operation, an assault pack will only suffice if your missions will be raids on the next door neighbors.

We had some unpleasant bumps and some very pleasant quality time. Today, however, everyone was thoroughly excited to exchange Valentine cards and eat cookies. We had lunch together (kind of a rare treat for us) and then distributed the cards. They loved the personal messages from their dad, the pretty pictures from their mom, and the sheer receipt of anything from their siblings. I gave them each one of the decorated pb jars filled with a box of animal crackers (my sister's genius idea), a couple chocolate kisses, and a couple mini raisin boxes. They were thrilled. I think they're discussing their Valentine's day adventures as I write, wishing they'd fall asleep, which is pretty cute.

I can't believe it has been 2 years! 2 wonderful, fast years since we brought Taryn daughter into our family. I know that celebrating "Gotcha Day" is a controversial subject in the adoption world. But, for our family, we have chosen to celebrate this special day! I bought 18 gifts in China while we were there to give her one special gift a year from her country. We DID eat Chinese food last night, but I decided (after the plans were already made) that eating Chinese food specifically on Gotcha Day is a little "hokey", so we might not be doing this one anymore! We will let her pick the restaurant from now on I think! However, we DID enjoy the Chinese food with the wonderful family we traveled to China with! This little girl and Taryn were in the orphanage together so we have a special "bond" with this family. Fortunately, they live close by so we can see them every once in a while. The girls are very cute together, at least I think so!

Four months later, it was St. Paddy's Day of 2006 and we got hitched! We still spend most of our time playing video games together, watching hours of Futurama, and telling each other nerdy jokes.

Ya, I think so. :)
The elder Albee was born in Machias, Maine on this day in 1857. At age 17, he dismayed his well-to-do family by running off and joining the circus.

Within 7 years he’d palmed his way up to circus executive.
For those of you on a budget, such as myself, your best bet would be Taobao or Ebay. Believe it or not, I have made some amazing hair purchases on Ebay. My most recent being a 50 inch wide, 2 feet long, platinum blonde Remy human hair track for under $60! So far I have owned these extensions for nearly two months and, despite being through multiple dyings, bleachings, washing, straightening, and curling, they are in perfect condition still! When buying from Ebay, make sure to check the sellers feedback! For anybody who is curious, this is the shop I bought my extensions from HCZGoods123, sadly they are on vacation for the Chinese New Year but will be back after January 31st~.

At 'Go!', the two women charged at the open Gateway. A couple of yards short, they bent as one and dived the last of the way. The Gate swallowed them, as tactile and resistant as air, and they emerged at the top of a four-hundred-foot plummet. Rings of shattered concrete, plaster and steel whistled past, the remains of the building's interiors, wrecked in the Realmcrash. By some fluke of engineering, almost the whole central part of the tower had smashed through, leaving a perfect vertical accelerator for a talented Gatemaker.
Now we’ve all been children and we’ve all had males as friends and we’ve all thought at one point it might be funny to see how your male friend would react if you “kicked him in the nuts”. You only make that mistake once. Nothing transforms a fun, laid back, male faster than having his pride bumped. As females, we sympathize and are apologetic for a long time, because we’ve never experienced something that could cause that much pain. Then we hit puberty, have our first period, and from that point on our sympathy card is gone. From then on its, “Get over it, have you ever had a period?”

And though I’m not typically a fan of the whole found-footage trend in filmmaking, I think the use of it worked particularly well in this film, especially in its use of characterizing Andrew. Instead of detracting from his character, the filmmakers were able to contrive a believable way of having the camera film Andrew himself, who had taken on the role of documentarian in the film. His growing obsession with filming every aspect of his day, of turning the camera onto himself (or in many scenes, above himself as the camera floated over his bed while he slept) seemed to both portray a state of loneliness so severe, the camera was more a figurative audience or friend Andrew created for himself as well as a comment on the way in which a new generation has become obsessed with the documentation of everything they do and a constant craving for others to watch and engage.
Spain became one of the leaders in the automobile industry after the 1950s when the government implemented new policies in the auto sector.

Back to that valuable lesson I alluded to earlier: I believe that it was the brave act of putting myself ‘out there’ that helped me to find and sign with my dream agent. If I hadn’t had the pluck to apply for the SCBWI WIP Grant, or to approach the editor in person in New York, or the moxie, okay…swagger to finagle an introduction to Michael at that party, or participated in my local SCBWI events, then it wouldn’t have happened the way it did. Be brave. Put yourself out there! Meet people, participate, take chances. Hell. You can’t win if you don’t play!

Today, Arthur Freed is considered synonymous with "MGM musicals", as if he were the only musical producer on the lot. Not so; there were also Cummings and Joe Pasternak (who had moved over from Universal, where he built his name on Deanna Durbin's pictures), and both got their share of the glory at the time. Still, Freed's unit was an awfully well-oiled machine, and Freed had a knack for attracting the best talent and getting the best out of it. His production of Girl Crazy reunited two men with a nostalgic stake in doing the thing right: Roger Edens and Georgie Stoll, both of whom had come far since their days in the orchestra pit of Girl Crazy on Broadway. Stoll is credited as musical director on the picture; Edens's credit reads "Musical Adaptation", but that hardly scratches the surface of what Edens really did. As I said before, he was Freed's right-hand man, much more than a "musical adaptor", and on Girl Crazy he was virtually what would later be called a line producer -- the guy actually on the set keeping an eye on things for the man in charge (i.e., Freed). And there was trouble almost immediately.
The recent mega-success of self-epublishing authors such as Amanda Hocking, John Locke, Darcie Chan, and Kerry Wilkinson has generated a lot of media attention over the past year or so. But the mega-successes aren't the only ones who are doing well: all over the Internet (notably at Joe Konrath's blog) you can find testimony from authors who cite substantial sales and earnings from self-published books. It's clear that something extraordinary is happening around electronic self-publishing (print self-publishing, by contrast, seems to be unaffected by the boom).
” We crouched behind the rocks about fourty feet from the cliff, Milligan to the left and I to the right. They tried to creep up the left side and after a short while a single man emerged from around the low thorn bushes a little way down from me. I let him move a little closer, pulled the trigger and he fell backwards and lay still .It was deadly silent for a short while which was broken by the sound of Jacksons voice echoing from behind the rocks. “Give it up boys, your surrounded ,there is nowhere to go, come on down and we will share the gold and go our seperate ways” “Go to hell Jackson” screamed Milligan, his voice reverberating around the rocks “You aint getting no gold cause we dont have it anymore, its buried out there in the desert where youll never find it, we seen how you executed Willy and Josh back there an we aint in no mind for the same, if you want us you gonna have to come an get us”

It can be something that shakes you up so much you have no strength to hold onto your defenses anymore. It can be a life threatening shock, or the loss of a loved one. It can even be a song, which notes, or lyrics hit a special place and magically opens you, much the same way a soul mate would. It goes beyond your defenses and hits straight home. It can be finally ending up in a place, or an event where you feel so much comfort and love, you let your guards down by means of that love. Once again it’s like the sun warming you until you melt, only this time it’s not a person, it’s a place, or an event.
But I wanted to wear it now, so I used it to spruce up a plain wool maxi dress and break up my usual head to toe black. I removed the slip that came with it and threw it over the top of my wool dress. It's harking back a bit to my childhood days of being forced to wear long woolly garments under pretty dress but what the hey, I got to wear the dress out on the weekend without freezing. It also made the dress a bit easier to wear during the day as the layering took the evening wear edge off it.

Bertie shook his head vigorously to ward of the flies and sunk his teeth into the belly of the giant bird.

If God were still revealing truth through trances and visions, the Bible would not be complete. If God’s word were not complete it would not be trustworthy. If the Bible is not trustworthy the world is in a state of anarchy; a most miserable state of affairs.

I watch a few mind-numbing TV shows, then go to bed. I whisper “good-night” as I head upstairs. He jumps up and follows me. We get into bed together, which is unusual anyway, he tends to sleep downstairs. I ask if he wants to say anything, he says no, just “I love you sweetie” and rolls over and starts snoring. I debate going downstairs, but don’t want to avoid him, or have my actions taken as hostile. But I could not fall asleep for forever, laying next to him, so confused.

The single outfit or free house appears a popular business model with beer geeks because of the freedom to procure products from wherever the owner/manager decides. Hence there may be beers uncommon in the pubs of that area or a quirky popular feature than generates trade. The pub may follow the current trend of offering multiple beer choices from around the world and be a beer geek’s paradise. The pub may or may not have an attached micro brewery but if it does it’ll be an unnecessary vanity of the owner. The pub will undoubtedly thrive on the wide choice available rather than the pong they brew out the back in the shed. Food may or may not be part of the model and once more fit in with the vanities of the owner. It could be a particular style of food or an adherence to snob driven food fads like organic local produce. It can even result in the customers denied their basic human right of Heinz ketchup and HP sauce if the owner decides he doesn’t want that putting on the fine local organic sausages. Whether this drives trade will be observable on an individual basis rather than an industry wide perspective. Success depends on the vanities of the owner finding favour with a sizable niche in the locale. The main trade will be products bought in that customers decide they cannot get elsewhere. Otherwise they would get it elsewhere because it would be cheaper to do so. If you make shed brewed pong, this is your retail outlet and if you want to buy it wade through the beards to get to the bar.

It's time for me to begin walking out the desires that God has been stirring up in me to serve and love the poor... in it I believe he is trying to bring me to a place of balance, where I have both contentment and peace in my heart and mind, and contentment and fulfillment, and fullness of life... in conjunction with caring for this body and mind via the gifts of nature and nutrition that God has given us, there is something much greater and more beautiful and life-giving about pouring yourself out that brings more health and life to the mind and the body than any external thing possibly could.

Lest it seem from this that I'm dissatisfied with my education and the way I grew up, I want to make it clear that that's definitely not the case. Unschooling gave me the space to grow into a person more confident than I ever imagined I could be in my younger years. I can't imagine having lived any differently, and I don't have regrets. Regrets to me are useless, and if I'm happy with the person I am now, and if everything that has happened in my life, all of my experiences, went into shaping my self and

This weekend saw the start of the 6 nations. A Northern Hemisphere international rugby tournament that the beeb have been good enough to put on the telly. Now I’m not that into rugby. Being a working class lad the sport of Rugby has always struck me as a bit of a posh boy’s game. Soccer or football to give it its proper name is more my game. But only more my game in so far as I understand the rules. I’m not that into it, I haven’t a team I follow. I gather my working class credentials would not be harmed by an interest in Rugby League but what is important about these sports is that however tedious they are they beat a trip round the shops. If you listen to the commentary you can often figure enough about the rules and jargon to give the appearance of knowing something about it.

Short post tonight as I need to be ready to hit the floor in high gear in the morning.
So while Rebecca was here, I subjected her to my favorite tracks off the CDs of all the other talented musicians I've harassed in the last few years, and she listened not only politely, but intently. I noticed that she seemed to be apprehending a new song as rapidly and comprehensively as I myself apprehend a new painting; she grasped all of the important elements before it was half over. It didn't matter whether she 'liked' it or not; she was just taking it in. And we talked about the creative process, and synesthesia, and she, like most of my other creative friends, promised to buy a painting of mine as soon as she could afford it. She looked at the paintings as intently as I listen to her music; she said, seriously, "You're a real artist."
After lunch, we noticed that there was a large group of people outside of a music store so we popped on over to see what the hype was about. Dad informed us that it was National Record Day. Dad looked at the records while Mom and I looked at the homemade crafty goodies. There were a ton of things like bags, shirts, and magnets that had Indiana and Indianapolis logos.
With that said, I’ve spent a lot of time the last month concentrating on verbalizing my food and concept. It is incredibly difficult – which is why I often need outside perspective and assistance in doing so. And as much as I don’t always agree with the process, I absolutely understand its necessity. Marketing, wording, formatting, menu description and design is paramount because people desire information in the proper measurements.
But the IMF quickly named its senior deputy managing director, former US Treasury executive John Lipsky, as acting chief. As Lipsky is a highly capable and very experienced credit expert, it’s hard to see what all the rush is about. It is true that DSK’s deputy is due to leave the IMF at the end of July – but that’s ten weeks away, and a lot of material facts could emerge in that time to change everything.
Fortunately not one of the men turns around. They are holding their stance yet I think I feel some shifting or re-assessment of plan…

You see, one of my goals is to make my blog a dynamic, interesting place. I don't have any false dreams about being able to support myself via blogging (I'd have to have actual writing talent first), but I do have dreams about making my blog just a bit bigger than it currently is. One such person who has mastered the art of growing an internet presence is Monica Leonelle who wrote the book Socialpunk.
Lunch was an ugly bowl of chicken, roasted chickpeas, and some stir fry vegetables. I am obsessed with roasted chickpeas. I can’t believe I used to hate chickpeas. I also had an Adora disk for a sweet calcium boost.
One thing I'm sorry the article doesn't address is what happens after the moment of inspiration. Novels take a long time to write. If you're constantly waiting for something from outside (actually inside) yourself to provide the impetus, progress is going to be slow. The gift needs to be nurtured.
Doesn’t it say it all? Yvonne Ridley (and MPACUK!) actually criticises Woolas for ‘stamping the Union Jack emblem on his campaign literature’. What a disgrace! The Leftist Muslim/Islam enablers, the PC brigade and Islamists like Ridley should have all got together and crucified Woolas Hamas (Muslim)-style.
It took more than a decade — more than the length of two World Wars — to open even the first piece of the Memorial, and even the first building — the Freedom Tower — is now scheduled for possible completion in 2015. From my experience Friday evening, I can predict that when what-is-today-a-boy-who-lost-his-father-or-mother at Ground Zero is old enough to take his children to visit where their grandfather perished, those little munchkins will get to start with a TSA-full-blown invasion and mugging.

Every once in a while, I will be sitting in front of the computer late at night and hear my hubby laughing hysterically from the living room. This is my indication that he is watching TV, and it’s probably adult swim on cartoon network. Adult swim hosts a variety of humorous and adult-themed programs that allow many people to discharge a day’s worth of turmoil in violent bouts of laughter. One of the shows he really likes is “American Dad”.
I like the brighter, more colourful paintings better. They suit the room (esp. with the brighter addition of the blanket) and are a cheery scene to wake up to each morning, as I begrudgingly haul my butt outta my warm, toasty bed and face the cold, snowy world.

For instance, there’s this one guy that makes it a point to wave at me whenever our paths cross. I talked to this guy once…for like ten minutes. That was almost eight months ago. I don’t even remember what the conversation was about. Anyways, this guy is dating a girl in my dorm, and every time he sees me, he drops everything he’s doing and makes it his priority to get my attention and wave. He will even ignore his girlfriend to holler to me. Creepy, right? Well, the thing I find hilarious is that his girlfriend glares at me every time she sees me. Honey, I don’t want your man. NO ONE DOES. Seriously though, he’s scrawny and unattractive…and creepy.

I first heard the song around Valentine’s Day & I really wanted to do a post to question the validity of expecting your special someone to wait patiently while you’re out getting trashed into the wee hours. First there’s the question of cash: I bet it would cost at least $75.00 to keep a drink in my hand (at around 3 beer/hour +tips) for 5 hours at a bar. That’s like enough to fill my car one & a half times. Then there’s the question your loved one might have about where you’re really at: your girl might be asking, did he hook up with an old flame? did he forget where he parked his car & get lost? did he get in a fight (at around the 3:21 mark T-Pain bumps into Wiz Khalifa & things look like they might get ugly for a second) & end up in jail? is he hittin’ the ol’ crack pipe & slummin’ it out in an abandoned warehouse with some old frat buddies?

For learning some nautical words, this book is excellent. Nothing too specific or hard, just stuff that a foreign-language landlubber like me has to check but won’t forget in a hurry. Very very simple stuff, but somewhat essential. Words that’ll come up in other books, too, like ‘doldrums’, ‘capstan’… And thanks to Scott Lynch I can now tell starboard from larboard! Rejoice!

I'm SO tempted to call her and tell her to get the hell out of our lives. She has never done any of us any good by being in it. I know that's harsh, but it's true. I've been hurt by her before, but that pain has been replaced with anger. And I will protect my dad and my family in any way I feel the need too. And if that means giving her a call, I'll do just that.

At first sight the judgment might appear to offer a glimmer of hope to Lego in dealing with competitors who market ‘slavish copies’ of the Lego brick shape, suggesting that the company may be able to rely on unfair competition rules. In the authors' view this suggestion is hollow, since unfair competition rules are outside the CJ's remit.

#4 would be rather cool if it was true. But it’s not. As far as I know I don’t even have any ancestors called Norman. My family on my father’s side can be traced back to some bloke (i.e. my paternal grandfather) in a Welsh town with a ridiculous amount of letters in it’s name, requiring three buckets of phlegm to pronounce it. My maternal family are somewhat more exotic in as much that they can be traced back (via my Auntie Pam’s memory) to at least the late 1800’s, a North London tribe known by the exceedingly uninventive name of ‘Smith’.

I believe in exercise and the power of endorphins. Exercise has kept me out of hospital for the last ten years. And it helped me tremendously last year while I waited for surgery. TMJ pain was the most incredible pain, like no other pain I've ever suffered. And I’m sure one of the reasons I coped so well and have recovered from major surgery so quickly was because of my level of fitness and the positive outlook.
I found that little gem in my readings (A dialogue between collaborators -- composer Kevin Volcans interviews Siobhan Davies) and I love it. I love it, I love it, I love it! It doesn't necessarily have anything to do with my analytical paper, but I don't mind. It's amazing all on it's own and I'm glad I found it. Siobhan Davies seems pretty fantastic and I'm kind of ashamed and surprised that I didn't know of her earlier.

Of great significance is the fact that one of the cases that the FBI examined – and that is described in a heavily-redacted memo of May 29, 1950 – dealt with the discovery of plague-infected rats at the highly sensitive Sandia Base, New Mexico, and which was viewed in some quarters as being the result of nothing less than a deliberate attempt to clandestinely introduce a widespread plague on Sandia by hostile, unknown sources. Significantly, the Sandia Base was, from 1946 to 1971, the primary nuclear weapons installation of the Department of Defense.

In Libya, in 1953, Jews were subjected to restrictions and became victims of economic boycotts. The Maccabi sports club was forcibly opened to Arab members in 1954. A decree was issued on 9 May 1957 obliging Libyans with relatives in Israel to register at the Libyan boycott office, even though at that point, 90 percent of the Jews had already left. On 3 December 1958, Tripoli's Jewish community ceased to be an independent entity. Thereafter it was overseen by a state-appointed commissioner. Legal exclusion worsened. In 1960, Jews were prohibited from acquiring new possessions. They were no longer allowed to vote, hold public office, or serve in the army or the police. On 2 April 1960, Alliance Israélite Universelle schools were closed.

It was so cool to watch her. The young woman and I were both a little, "I hope no one's secretly videotaping this" as we danced across the floor; I'm getting better, but I'm still a little spastic when it comes to following dance steps. But Becky just let loose and enjoyed herself. And it showed.
How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel. They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham: But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.

In most vampire stories abstainers are usually rare and even then they still drink the blood of animals or, in the case of True Blood, a synthetic substitute. Feeding off each other is not normally considered an option. In Haig’s vampire world the blood of vampires is actually preferred to human blood and so there’s no real reason why Peter and his wife could not drink from each other. They choose not to but it seems that Helen is the driving force behind that decision. So it’s no wonder that Peter is eyeing up the necks of his neighbour’s wife and sniffing his patients’ blood samples. It was she that also insisted they rid themselves of vampire literature, films and music. Somehow Byron manages to escape the cull. The only book about vampires they now own is The Abstainer’s Handbook which Matt quotes from often. It is a clever and effective way of explaining many of the rules of his version of vampire society. There’s also a handy glossary not that it’s really needed but if you forget abbreviations like OBT (Overwhelming Blood Thirst) or OVA (Orphaned Vampire Unit) it’s there. Here are a couple of quotes from the Handbook:

I have also had conversations with people who were up in arms about gay marriage. They were very displeased that it would be allowed at all. It would RUIN the whole definition of marriage, they insisted. A marriage is a sacred, and marvelous, and romantic, and infallible institution between a STRAIGHT man, and a STRAIGHT woman.
As far is cooking is concerned, there is such great produce, not just fresh but of course the limitless range of cheeses, preserved salami-style meats in all sizes and shapes, and irresistable desserts, and I realise it's just as well we've been walking or biking for at least an hour a day! Every market showcases their own regional, boutique produce - there are so many different kinds of goats cheese, for example. I really like the way food is valued here. Fruit is sold on the basis of 'do you want to eat it now, tomorrow, or in a week's time?', and I haven't yet bought anything that rots from the core before it ripens!
No Chipotle burrito and taco restaurant has ever made me as sad as the one that sits on St Marks Place. I can't be overdramatic and say that every instance of gentrification is a bad one, but this particular case, standing next door to a gourmet grocery store, is a bit more notable than most.

Since I can't give parents my assessment forms, I made some general assessment data forms to give to them.

Our goal is just to add another way we are keeping them informed.

Aren't beer drinkers considered a minority in the country? We are usually treated like it. I never see a Beer Cellar in an upscale apartment in New York City. The Wall Street guys aren't taking a vacation to Munich for Oktoberfest, or Denver. Instead they head to France, or the Napa Valley to sip and spit out their wine. That's doesn't sound like a good time to me. Belgium is right next to France people. And there, you don't have to spit out the beer.

The exact product range is difficult to list as it changes throughout the year. “Don’t expect to find strawberry ice-cream in November” says Myriam Labbe, “our products follow the seasons”. What do we have to look forward to in the autumn and winter though when fresh produce is more scarce? Wilfired Wattier thinks, “We make a Beaujolais sorbet” he replies. When I mention that I’d heard that it was the impossible grail of ice-cream producers to make something from wine he smiles. “Yes, but the secret to producing ice-cream and sorbets with alcohol is to use a lot of fruit. We know that the Beaujolais flavour will only work if we add plenty of grapes.” Again, the secret is the natural.
Well it was almost like a Lonely Planet of food. The scope of the book was huge and therefore it lacks in depth. The book covers just 2,3 eats in a place. In one or two paras each. But manages to hold you despite the limitations of its form. It makes your mind wander into the far reaches of the country. They do the hard work for you – I am sure lot of bumpy roads, dirty toilets, bed bugs and stomach runs would have gone into the making of this book.
Eventually, we considered their assurance of safety and felt that company-related taxi cabs (like the Toyota Camry) was safer although it was much more expensive compared to the regular pink ones that nobody is moderating or monitoring. Considering that we are going to travel in an unknown place, towards a border that we don’t know exactly what to expect, we gave in to 3000 baht after much bargaining (from 4000 baht) and negotiation. After all, safety will always be priceless and should be prioritized at all times.

After signing to Earache Records and seeing the relative success of ‘Woods 4: The Green Album’ last year, things were looking up for Woods Of Ypres. Little did we know at the time, that fifth record ‘Woods 5: Grey Skies & Electric Light’ would be released under such shadowed circumstances. The tragic death of David Gold shook fans to the core near the end of December last year, and instead of marking a new era, this record brings an indefinite period in the Canadian act’s existence.

I am getting a little bit bored with the narrative ‘life-story’ of my characters now. It was interesting to begin with, but now it is increasingly frustrating to have to know the details about how they would react in certain situations when those circumstances may never appear in the novel. I really just want to be able to get on with writing it: but I still haven’t reached the point in my protagonist’s story where her future behaviour is explained sufficiently for me to really communicate any understanding of it.
This past weekend David and I went on a long-overdue visit to see my parents in St. Louis. We ate incredibly well and my parents were also kind enough to host our friends Scott and Kathy, who moved to Kentucky but came up to visit. Scott and Kathy married David and I, so they have a special place in our lives.

Finally, again as the State says it needs to bail out these banks in order to save the Capitalists, it could be asked to make all of those Capitalists pay the price. In my post How To Pay For The Deficit, I argued that it would be possible to raise a tax in kind on Capital, by requiring every limited company to issue new shares equal to 10% of its existing shares, and to simply hand them to the State, who could then sell them – or alternatively could hand them directly to every Man, Woman, and Child to do with as they chose.

A problem for NASA aeronautics is the success of its 2006 restructuring to focus on fundamental research. After five years of relative stability, many technologies are reaching a maturity where they require expensive demonstrations, including flight tests, to move to the next level of readiness and closer to being usable by industry. Examples include low-boom supersonic aircraft, which must be demonstrated in flight if regulators are to be convinced to remove the ban on civil supersonic flight over land.

I miss you, the woman I used to be, the woman who used to really, truly believe in love. I miss you, the person who thought about children and mapped out forever in her mind. I miss you, the person who really thought “till death do us part” was possible – even in “sickness and in health.” These vows were doable, achievable, if both people worked at them and really loved one another. I miss the person that was willing to sacrifice herself for another person, simply because she loved and believed in them.

Does a 25% profit mean that the project could be reduced only by a relatively small amount for the developer to be comfortable? This is a variant of FCR's statement that the infrastructure costs require a certain scale for profit. But that's backwards--the city could have, as it has proposed for the Hudson Yards, absorbed some of the infrastructure costs and then put the property out for bid, rather than let the developer determine the scale.

I find it really cool that though she found me through couchsurfing, she's a former unschooler and NBTSCer (Not Back to School Camper), so we already had friends in common! We hit it off really well, and for the five days she was here, I had a great time. We wandered the city, helped set up for the bookfair, ate yummy food, chattered through long bus rides, hung out at the bookfair a bunch, met lots of cool people, bought some cool shit, lay around in the sun, went to a seriously awesome punk show... Photos would probably make things look more interesting, but I have none. Anyway, a very good time was had, which is good, because I was really looking forward to the bookfair this year, and also really looking forward to my first couchsurfing hosting experience, so it's lovely that everything actually met my expectations (which doesn't happen as often as I'd like)!

Recently we spoke our truth to our therapist, and that truth finally permeated through the depths of our system. Now all inside know of what happened, and all believe and know of its truth even if the events didn’t happen on “their watch.” What happened to “one of us” happened to all of us. There is understanding and a unity inside that didn’t exist before. We have a common goal—to heal.
While anyone else on earth by this point would have just said "hey, it looks like this is not for you so I'm just going to cancel you". But i still stupidly tried to pacify him.

Success in B2B innovation has benefited greatly from friendly government policies, such as establishing market access barriers; influencing the nature of cross-border collaborations by setting intellectual-property requirements in electric vehicles, high-speed trains, and other segments; and creating domestic-purchasing policies that favor Chinese-made goods and services. Many view these policies as loading the dice in favor of Chinese companies, but multinationals should be prepared for their continued enforcement.
Spring in my family meant new spring clothes; a dress or two, new shoes, and a spring coat. Usually the clothing was sewn by my mother, and although I’d see the pattern, and glory in tracing my fingers along the fabric, my sisters and I would only have glimpses of the garments until they were almost finished. Sometimes I’d gaze in wonder and growing anticipation at the little heap of shapes on my mother’s sewing table.
The young woman is a 'reproductive justice' activist, the perfect person for the Dark Side to use to pit Republicans (that wealthy, greedy, uncaring, selfish lot) against the Democrats (the poor and downtrodden, whose main concern are the even poorer and more downtrodden). Yeah, right. The truly downtrodden here are the American taxpayers - the ever-more-burdened, shrinking percentage of people in this country who are actually working and contributing to the money pot from whence all the free goodies are supposed to flow. Of course, that's after we pay to bail out Europe and fund wars around the globe.
Colossians 1:24 (NIV): “ Now I rejoice in what I am suffering for you, and I fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to Christ’s afflictions, for the sake of His body, which is the Church.”
"Written at a time of social unrest, the book is set during the period of the Napoleonic Wars, when economic hardship led to riots in the woollen district of Yorkshire. A mill-owner, Robert Moore, is determined to introduce new machinery despite fierce opposition from his workers; he ignores their suffering, and puts his own life at risk. Robert sees marriage to the wealthy Shirley Keeldar as the solution to his difficulties, but he loves his cousin Caroline." This book doesn't have the passion of Jane Eyre, nor the sweeping plot, but has historical detail instead. Rather than the characters or the plot, the most interesting thing for me was the discovery that at the time of writing, 'Shirley' was a man's name, only becoming associated with women as a result of this novel. All progresses and ends as it should, of course, but for me there were too many subsidiary characters, most of them associated with the church - I don't really know the difference between a vicar, rector, curate and parish priest, but it seemed to matter. And it's stuffed full of references to biblical and Graeco-Roman characters, all of which made me feel I was missing something. Meh.

As individuals, our lives should reflect this sort of holy, gospel-motivated subversion. And when we interact with the marginalized members of our communities – especially those in prison – we should encourage them to a similar life. It will, of course, be a radical departure from the life they knew before prison. But neither will it be an embrace of a safe conformist lifestyle like the one so often embraced by white middle-class evangelicals.

Speaking of getting back to the basics, DC had gambled with Justice League Detroit, attempting to emulate the edgy success of ‘The Uncanny X-Men’ and ‘The New Teen Titans,’ only to have it fail miserably. Writer Keith Giffen had hopes of restoring the League to its former glory, but alas others at DC had other plans for The Flash, Wonder Woman, Superman, and the other big guns. Instead, he and co-writer J.M. DeMatteis assembled a team composed of various representatives of the parallel Earths that has recently been merged into one. From Earth 1, there was Batman, Guy Gardner, Black Canary, and stalwart Martian Manhunter. From Earth 2 came Dr. Fate. From Earth S, we had Captain Marvel. From Earth 4, there was Blue Beetle. Dr. Light was the first hero to emerge from ‘Crisis on Infinite Earths.’ And Mister Miracle represented Jack Kirby’s Fourth World. This quirky blend soon established its own voice and is still a fan favorite era for the team. And this static group shot was recreated over and over over the years with various twists and cast members.

So for Sham al-Nassim I send greetings to all Egyptians and Sudanese, Muslim and Christian and Jewish, secular and Islamist, whether they are near the Nile today or anywhere else in the world.

Here's a photo celebrating the symbols of Sham al-Nassim:
Hidden on Earth from him are two teenagers, Stella and Isaac, who are entirely unaware they are inherent of the Zodiacs through the royal line.

After I got home and had a few things situated I logged into my wordpress account to check everything. I was catching up reading some blogs.

Finally, grill the pork. Heat your grill to a high temperature at first and get a good sear on the outside of the pork on both sides. Turn down the temperature to medium and cook until the meat reaches your desired internal temperature. The pork should reach 160 degrees before serving. Take the pork off the grill and allow to rest at least 5 minutes before cutting. Slice the pork into thin medallions for serving.

They are asking “why is my life falling apart?” Or, “how do I get past the fact that I was sexually molested when I was eight?” Or, “how do I, as a single mom, lead and provide for my family?”

One day I discovered “Lucifer Rising” by Kenneth Anger. He was an avant garde moviemaker and his work inspired me on both sides: photography and music. I was amazed that he shot some scenes at a celtic cult place, called the “Externsteine” in Germany. It is a very old rock formation that maybe got used as an oberservatory in Celtic Times. One of the towers got an altar. Above the altar is a round window, which focus the rising sun at the summer solstice. Thats why scientists believe this room might have been used for astronomical observations.

about five years ago, I felt a need to reach out to the Southern Baptists. No, in 1990—longer than five years ago—I had an assembly of about forty leading Southern Baptists at the Carter Center. Seven of them had been or would be presidents of the Southern Baptist Convention and we tried to see how we could bring all the Baptists back together in a spirit of harmony. We had good luck while we were at the Carter Center, but that was kind of undone later on and, to my grief. About five years ago, I started to say, we started a move called “A New Baptist Covenant,” primarily designed to end the distinction between black and white Baptists and so we had an assembly in Atlanta, with which you may be familiar. We had about fifteen-sixteen thousand people come, about half black and half white, together. And we also reached out to Hispanics in Texas and other places and also to some Asians. Now and so I’ve tried the best I could to bring all the Baptists back together and I think that the World Baptist Assembly is an umbrella under which we could all serve. We at our New Baptist Covenant, which I’ve been one of the leaders of it, we always take the position that we should just assume that all of us believe that we are saved by the grace of God, through our faith in Jesus Christ. And in detailed issues like homosexuality or status of women or the autonomy of individual churches or the leadership of a pastor leader or a servant, those kind of things be relegated to a completely secondary position and bring us Christians back together, but so far that has not been possible. And so I’m grieved about it and I don’t claim that I’m right and other people are wrong,

It was the story of Reagan’s life – from his childhood which was greatly influenced by his Christian mom, Nelle. Like Reagan, Nelle had an irrepressible positive outlook that she passed on to Ron. Was the tone of the book positive? Yes, but from a book of this type I’d expect that. It’s not an expose. And some “negative” aspects are covered – Reagan not attending church much while president (he said it was because he didn’t want to put fellow churchgoers in danger), Nancy’s faith not being nearly as strong, and Reagan’s disappointment at his son Ron’s lack of faith.
This point should need no discussion… but it does. One of the major problems I see in my work with blog publishers (I write their articles for them) is that these folks still see the business of blogging as something casual, episodic, to be done when and if they have the time.

Jack Wilshere has been a source of friction with former caretaker manager, Stuart Pearce. Hopefully Hodgson will be more mindful of overplaying the youngster. It is a hard temptation given that what remains of the self-styled Golden Generation is an utter shambles. Wilshere wasted no time in congratulating the new England manager although I am not sure Roy will have read the comment as soon as it appeared on Twitter. No doubt the FA employ a media clippings service; they probably rely on the Disciplinary Department for news on what is being said on Twitter.

Online, CPM doesn’t actually make a lot of sense for another big reason: The thing that causes the impression — a blog post, a Facebook post, and to a lesser degree, a Tweet — persists. Forever. Or at least as long as there’s a Google.
Being online means sharing as much or as little of your life, with as many people as you choose. This blog was designed with the idea that I would write when I chose to, and to not get overly personal. I have bared too much of my soul to too many disinterested people, and having a very public mental health breakdown was not my proudest moment – luckily few people seemed to realise this had happened.
I love my silly, skinny girl with all the long brown hair so much. And she loves dogs more than anyone in the universe ever, but please don't bring an actual live dog very close to her or she might have to climb the nearest adult. Her favorite things are beanie babies, laughing, listening to music, driving her big sister crazy, reading Calvin and Hobbes aloud, meeting new friends, coordinating wild outfits, and eating pizza. My delicate flower can eat you under the table and issue some pretty impressive burps afterward. She keeps us laughing. We are so thankful for her.

Many of you will know that Dr. Norman Horrocks, Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie’s School of Information Management and legendary librarian, passed away last week. Norman was a longtime HLA member, great supporter and friend to this Association. Those in attendance at our last AGM in May will remember him there sharing stories and, of course, paying close attention to the agenda. He was always on hand to offer advice and quietly guided many a meeting with his extraordinary parliamentarian skills. Knowledgeable and kind, a mentor and friend, he gave of his time unconditionally. Norman was a remarkable person and a true gentleman. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.

For most of the 2nd-Q, we would hold a small lead while the starters rested, until about the 5½ minute mark, when Conley hit a three to give them the lead 37-36. But that wasn't all. We were scoreless for almost 6 minutes, during which Memphis scored 13 straight to change the game (44-36, Memphis). Duncan & Diaw would be the ones to bring us back, however, as some tight D and several key shots brought the half to an end - down by just 4, 49-45: a Spurs 13-1 run!

Fucking hell. Months of torture, and it's due to a prescription medication.

There were two minor setbacks to this version of the Coconut Cream Pie (same preparation as in the last Coconut Cream post, but made more of the pastry cream filling). The first was that one of my crusts got droopy in the oven again. Since it got covered up with a mountain of whipped cream, it didn't end up affecting the aesthetics at all. The second downer was that I overindulged in libations before making the whipped cream and toasting the coconut. I honestly don't even remember if I added any sugar or flavoring to the cream before whipping it up. And I had a teeny bit of help toasting the coconut and manning the mixer while I ran upstairs to use the bathroom.

It was a wonderful spring day, and we needed to air out the winter both of us.
The point I’m making here (badly) is that an anime has to really impress me to get me to not only watch it, but also to make a commitment to it. I really did enjoy the first six or so episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist (aka 鋼の鍊金術師、Hagane no Renkinjutsushi or more simply Hagaren) until it veered off so abruptly and sharply from the manga that I still have some residual whiplash. That was the last anime I watched until last year, when my faith was restored in the medium by Death Note.
First to be presented to us were dainty rolls of Seared Toro (tuna belly) and Monkfish Liver, tied neatly together with daikon strips and finished with thinly sliced scallions, 22-carat gold leaf and a light yuzu dressing. Extremely well-balanced; fatty tuna melting away to reveal creamy monkfish liver (surprisingly mild), with a welcome acid hit the sharp dressing and gently pickled daikon, which together with the spring onions gave texture to the mouthful.
I love my stepsisters – I really do. And Lauren is my favourite. She's sweet, she's clever, and she looks at me as if I'm a goddess – she definitely has good taste in role models! She's just becoming so, so clingy. This is the third time she's phoned me over the past couple of weeks when I was out, and every time she just wants a chat. Still, I'll make sure I make some time for her over the weekend, just in case it's something important.
My life is still on that fast roller coaster track. God is full control and I believe he has strapped me in tight and is taking me on the most exciting ride of my life. My heart is pounding with anticipation. My head is filling with hopes and dreams and my stomach is still a bit nauseous. I expect sharp curves. I anticipate uphill travel and it may take a long time to reach the top. I am certain that I will fall pretty fast and hard some times. BUT as long as I have the gift of PEACE, I can enjoy the ride!

Almost from the first sentence, I realised Bartimaeus was an ideal protagonist for me: I loved his insolence, his energy, his self-awareness, his ability to undercut many of the pomposities of fantasy with a well-timed footnote. I suppose by the end he may have drifted fairly far from his classical Arabic antecedents, but in his essential characteristics – his mercurial shape-shifting, his ambivalent approach to humans, and (above all, perhaps) the constant restrictions placed upon his supernatural powers – he remains very much a paid-up, card-carrying member of that hard-working class of magical entities, the noble djinn.

I truly wished I was with someone for this little trip back into time because THE BUILDINGS AREN’T SECURE and I am more daring with a co-conspirator. But I was alone on purportedly haunted grounds with the cops trolling me. The most daring thing I did was enter a building whose doors were flung wide open by the wind, doors which kept banging every time the wind snatched them. Each bang made me jump. I ducked between each rabid flinging of the door, entered the building, and looked around. I was disappointed. I felt like I had entered my grade school building. Boring!!! I took the above photo from within the building, then left.

The First Act or exposition stage of a film introduces the characters and shows Jenny's normal life and introduces her ambition for Oxford. Jenny's normal world is disrupted by David who enters it at 6 minutes into the film and defines himself as a Jew. This is the part of a film where character is defined and this is how we interpret the film; we carry this notion of his character through the film. This view of David acting as he does because he is Jewish is not undercut later in the film and this is the context in which all his actions now take place. He is defined as someone Jewish behaving in a typical way rather than a sociopath who happens to be Jewish as is usual in contemporary film and drama. This departs from the orthodox ideology and presents his badness as growing out of being Jewish.
Elements of language and identity feature prominently in Jude. Its eponymous hero, an irrepressible young Irishman, initially finds his speech emerging in the form of parodically British English as a result of a “Mental Catastrophe” (explained in this extract).
A few days ago, I went to a salon to get my hair colored and cut, and to have a manicure. I didn’t anticipate too many difficulties; I’d been there before. Granted, I had previously come with an entourage that included my Brazilian mother-in-law and my daughter, both of who’s need for attention downplayed my inability to properly speak the language.
Hauck-Lawson recalls the Brooklyn of her childhood in one of the book’s essays, “My Little Town: A Brooklyn Girl’s Food Voice.” Growing up in the Park Slope of the 1960s, she and her family were “locavores” long before the term came into use. The “postage stamp” backyard of her family’s Third Street brownstone was a small, functioning farm, and at times even accommodated the family “pets” — roosters and piglets — who later ended up on the dining room table. The family also foraged for food in the greater city: Tufts of chives were plucked from Prospect Park, dandelions were brought home and cooked with garlic and olive oil, fruit that fell from privately owned trees onto a city sidewalk was “fair game.”

I certainly was not going to help him push the button, or push him across the street, because I have helped old people before, and they will fuck you over every time. I just know that if I had helped him cross the street, he would have wanted me to continue pushing him the four miles uphill to get him back to the place he rolled out of. What am I, a gift?

On Good Friday, all the flags on the island flew at half mast. We found it enormously inspiring to spend Holy Week and Easter in a country where faith is an overt and unself-conscious part of life, just as it was inspiring to discover the continuing significance to the island of the Knights of St. John. We were cheered, too, by the warmth of the welcome given us by all Maltese and by their particular kindness to children, ensuring that the boys enjoyed their holiday as much as their parents. And really, with that friendly reception plus boat trips, pageants, Italian ice cream and vivid true stories of knights, saints, pirates and wartime heroism, what’s not to like – for little boys as much as for their parents?
To keep the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Robert Rubin in line, he too was also cloned.

We soon turned onto The King’s Highway, one of Jordan’s two north-south corridors. The road dates back to Biblical times when Moses lead his people to first see the promised land at Mt. Nebo. If accompanied on this highway by a Bible, Koran, history book, and a good archeologist, one could check off Biblical sites, Roman fortresses, the massive Crusader castle at Kerak, fine Christian mosaics, a 1918 battle site for Arab Independence at Al Tafilah, early Islamic towns, a Shia holy shrine and the Nabataean capital of Petra. Add in the geological wonder of the Wadi Mujib, Jordan’s Grand Canyon, and your Jordan bucket list just got smaller.

Stormzone attracted many friends with the debut album including admiration from legendary producer/DJ Neal Kay who saw in the band the same early signs of stardom shown by another group he discovered, Iron Maiden! With the band playing live constantly they inevitably hardened up their sound so the new recordings came out much more aggressive than the first album but still kept the quality, melody and harmony of before. Co-produced by Neal Kay the new album was finished towards the end of 2009.
Many years ago, my sister Margaret and I used to look for reflections of ourselves in fairy tales. We particularly liked to pretend that we were “Snow White and Rose Red” from the Grimm fairy tale, because we found the illustrations and descriptions of the two sisters to be pretty accurate.

Honestly, Mindy was one of the best parts in this book. Her sense of humor and strength carried the book for me. I found myself more interested in the side story between her and Raniero than the main characters. All in all after the enormous wait for this book it just didn't measure up to the other books or my expectations. Key aspects of the book were missing. Although, the plot moves and there is some fun dialogue it is just missing that "it" factor the other two have.

During that time I worried about my pregnancy and whether or not it was going to happen this time around. I had an ultrasound around 6 weeks and they couldn't see anything in the uterus. They decided to check my HCG levels so I had blood testing 2 times in one week. The doctor was worried my levels were not high enough so I braced myself for another disappointment. A week and a half later they did another ultrasound and found a heartbeat and fetus. I was happily but still nervous. I was able to have another ultrasound right before I left kentucky and everything looked good.
I’ve noticed lately, that my computer has been insanely bogged down. My CS5 is running at a really glacial pace, which is slowing down photo editing something awful. I’ve been working on a nice watermark to slap all over our photos, but I was barely able to create a text box in under 3 minutes. I realized that the sheer mass of photographic excellence on this computer’s hard drive might be the culprit. There are easily close to 10,000 photos on my desktop, if not more than that. While I do love each and every one, it was time to do some deleting.

There are a few neurological examinations of deja vu that are a little bit better about explaining it but still nothing groundbreaking. Basically it’s been noted that it can occur frequently in people experiencing some form of pathological mental disorder. There are frequent reports of deja vu experiences in epileptics, and because epileptics are one of the few groups of people whose brains we can jam electrodes into in the name of science, there are a few reported findings of induced “dreamy” states that are similar to deja vu during some stimulations of the temporal cortex. Of course, it’s entirely possible that these deja vu-like states experienced in pathological patients bear only a surface resemblance to actual deja vu, in the way that visual hallucinations aren’t caused by the same phenomena as actual vision. Then there are more of those asynchronicity explanations, only with “neurological pathway” replacing “process”. At least these have some better surface validity though, I can see where it’s possible that two pathways for sensory information might split into a sort of double vision. Of course, that explanation doesn’t match the subjective experience at all, because people experience all sensory perception during deja vu as occurring simultaneously as normal. The “two pathway” explanation loses a lot if it becomes the “12 really intricately timed pathways” explanation. They’re all so frigging general though! “Slowed transmission” “something going wrong during a seizure”, etc. So again, yes maybe the function of the brain might affect an experience we have somehow good job guys.
Sure, I am organizing our storage area. Yup, I'm cleaning our transom windows. I'm fluffy and fussing all about the house. However, this is not unlike my non-pregnant self (besides my gloriously impressive cankles).
CONGRATULATIONS, YOU HAVE PRIVILEGE!
So, one of my favorite bloggers, The Bargain Queen, has posted the first ever Fabulous! Festival. It's like the Carnival of Couture, for those who remember that, except this one doesn't have a weekly theme. I totally want a weekly theme or question, but the bloggers hosting it for the week can decide to do that if they want, so yay! I try to participate one week... After finals are over....
and Closed on Sunday :)
but it’s not of me

You won’t want to leave and forever you’ll stay
Now, supposedly these twats are also moms. As you all know, I revere moms. So, I say, that if these particular twats refuse to boycott me then they should re-direct their twatish energy towards more needy causes than banning slutty t-shirts and kicking the comedy-baby-Jesus (read: Ellen).
Change the religious sentiment of the North on the subject of slavery and the political action of the North will instantly co-operate with it.

place pandan leaf strips into blender and add water until it is just sufficient for the leaves to be blended. The volume of water added needs to be controlled according to the number of leaves used, and the size of the leaves. Add just sufficient for the blades of the blender to run smoothly. Allow it to blitz for at least a couple of minutes until it forms a fine pulpy mash.
I dare not grasp or put my will upon
then what really happened to all of them?

My message to the TSA and the local police is that the bankers know this will happen. They are as smart as I am and knew decades ago what would happen when their Ponzi scheme bubble would burst. They prepared for that day by blowing up the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on 911. They got their National Security State by passing the Patriot Act, creating the TSA and repealing Habeas Corpus and and the Bill of Rights.
