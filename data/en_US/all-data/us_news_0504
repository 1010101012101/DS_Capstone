• Brendan Bowers of SLAM with a Q&A with Blazers forward J.J. Hickson, who says he'd like to re-sign with the Blazers this summer: "Of course, I would love it. I’ve been getting some positive feedback from Coach, and from the organization as a whole, and I would love to re-sign here. As far as the guys on the court, as far as my teammates go, we all like each other off the court and we all get along too. Guys hang out off the court, and I think that builds a chemistry that leads to winning basketball. So I would love to come back here, continue to be a Portland Trailblazer, and help be part of something special that we’re building here."

This isn't to say that oxytocin always makes us good or generous or trusting. In our rough-and-tumble world, an unwavering response of openness and loving kindness would be like going around with a "kick me" sign on your back. Instead, the moral molecule works like a gyroscope, helping us to maintain our balance between behavior based on trust and behavior based on wariness and distrust. In this way oxytocin helps us to navigate between the social benefits of openness—which are considerable—and the reasonable caution that we need to avoid being taken for a ride.

Sparky never forgot those words. I remember the first time he told them to me. He was proud that Alston had taken the time to share them with him. Right to the end, he kept those words close to his heart. He would have made Alston proud.
The advent of sophisticated, usually computerized, tracking has allowed police departments greater insight into the actions of officers — and, thus, clues about who may be indulging in racism — but better tools must be employed smartly. A traffic officer who stops only blacks or Latinos while working in West Los Angeles is probably missing something or covering up something; an officer working a night shift in South Los Angeles might well be fully justified in making such stops exclusively, because he might go an entire shift without seeing a single white driver. Smart analysis of that data can help officials sniff out trouble, but it won't always be enough. Where they find deception, they may see all too clearly into an officer's head.
NEW YORK -- Fed up with rising fees, interest rate hikes, limit cuts and other harsh changes to their credit cards, most consumers want the date for major reforms moved up.

The special irony in this case, however, is that so many of the "Entourage" plots are based on fast-lane Hollywood temptations.

"My receptionist and two of my staff were sitting in the front desk when (the shooting started), and they could see out the window. We heard the shots and a couple of the girls screamed and said that 'A man just shot that man.'

The hearing is without the usual drama that precedes Lohan's recent court appearances, which have focused on the actress' shortcomings by missing court-ordered therapy sessions and getting booted from a community service assignment at a women's shelter. The "Mean Girls" star spent less than five hours at a jail last month as part of a 30-day sentence imposed by Judge Stephanie Sautner for Lohan's continued misbehavior.

People who have lost a spouse too young — I've known a few — can sometimes do self-sabotaging things. But the premise put forth in this title-tells-all family flick is kind of hard to buy, despite being based on a memoir.
Part of the allure of Baraka is the interior that opens onto the tree-lined streets of Potrero Hill but still has an Arabian Nights appeal, with deep red walls set with cubbyholes with votive candles. A candle-laden wrought-iron chandelier in the center of the 48-seat dining room further enhances the exotic, romantic mood.
The play’s rough-hewn vernacular poetry and the supernatural journey at the heart of Act II put a premium on the rhythm of lines and scenes, and some opening-night stumbles by Brenda Phillips as the ancient community matriarch Aunt Esther kept the dramatic flow from being as effective as it otherwise might. Phillips plays the role with an endearing manner, matronly yet sharp-tongued. But Aunt Esther is above all a spiritual leader, a spirit guide even, and many of her lines need to land with more deliberate weight than they do here.
Every season, all but one NFL team - the Super Bowl champion - has to settle for pointing to the next campaign as the one in which it will win the title. And only one team can be right, while most of the others fall back on the same field of future dreams.

"It can be hard to fit into that scene when you're just starting out," Huff, 31, explained. "We chose a bookstore because clubs didn't let us try different, out-of-the-ordinary stuff. We wanted a place to really rock it, to try out new material and get experience all in a friendly atmosphere."
One word on itemized deductions: You may have heard people talk about them as a way to reduce taxable income. This is a good strategy for the self-employed or homeowners who can take big deductions for related expenses. But if you don't fall into those two categories, you're probably better off with the standard deduction, which, for the 2011 filing season, is $5,800 if you're single or $11,600 if you're married.

2007 Millbrandt Vineyards "Traditions" Chardonnay, Columbia Valley, Wash. ($11-$13) - The color is clear light yellow. The aroma is faint with a touch of pear and spice. The taste is minerally and a little hot. I found it disjointed. 83 points.

It's easy to see that smart grid's wealth of information offers an opportunity to reduce a monthly bill. But its tiered system of charges also could carry a sting for those who don't want to be bothered.

Meeks has become a starter mostly in name only, playing Keith Bogans-type minutes as the 76ers play Lou Williams and Evan Turner off the bench. Meeks is fundamentally sound and doesn't make many mistakes, but this is the time of year for which the Bulls acquired Hamilton. He has averaged 20.6 points in 120 career postseason games and played well down the stretch of the regular season after battling injuries throughout. Edge: Bulls.

When we arrived at Union Station, I was mortified to see my father parked at the front door of the station in his cab. I didn't remember telling him exactly when we were leaving, so I thought maybe it was coincidence and he was just waiting to get a fare. I didn't want my friend to see me talking to him, so I walked right by him, in front of his car, and never looked at him like I didn't see him. Once we got inside and put our stuff down, I made an excuse to go back out to see him, but it was too late, he had taken off.

She has a lot to do, squeezing the volunteer market work in with her day job as a massage therapist.
This was vintage Moyer. And that's saying something for a guy who has thrown more than 58,000 pitches. Baseball scouts armed with stopwatches and radar guns prefer pitchers bigger and stronger. The radar gun becomes the résumé. Moyer, as said before, is a raider of a lost art. He topped out at 79 miles per hour on his fastball and shrewdly blended in a 27 changeups and four curveballs.
The EPA sampled the well water of a total of 61 homes, though it released data on only 59 because regulators were unable to contact two of the homeowners.

"We realized very quickly that we found ourselves in front of a very difficult mission," said Chairman Jean-Luc Dehaene.

"Frontier's recent decision to place a significant and unjustified rate increase on its customers, along with the incongruity of Frontier's justification for that increase against the statements made in 2009 and 2010, makes us question whether Frontier has, or ever had, a good faith commitment to fulfill the terms of the franchise," Crest wrote.

Perhaps most famously, Rowling announced in 2007 that professor Albus Dumbledore, the brilliant Hogwarts headmaster, is gay.

The game first shipped for Xbox a full year before Microsoft would launch their Xbox Live service, so split-screen multiplayer and system link were the only way to access the game's multiplayer features before Microsoft ported it to computers in 2003.

But men's brows are naturally flat or only slightly arched, so if the arch in a man is lifted, he will look weird.

Environmentalists who urge Christie to defend the rule fear he may break with New Jersey’s tradition of fighting polluters in other states.

Consumers are holding off on big purchases like home renovations because employment is still a concern, Goldman said. That hurts companies like Lowe's that rely on big spending from U.S. customers. But they're also being choosy when it comes to staples including food. Campbell's report reflected that caution.
The state budget assumes savings found in many of the proposals. If the Legislature doesn't pass the measures, Nixon will have to find more cuts.

That year, many Atlanta elementary and middle schools posted gains on state achievement tests so large that they defied statistical probabilities — gains that prompted investigations that found widespread wrongdoing.
When the authorities went to arrest the Ramsey resident, Carter said, he was distributing heroin to another Ramsey man, 29-year-old Brian Leaman. Leaman was arrested and charged with possessing heroin and then released on his own recognizance.
Of course, the president's real problem is that his policies have failed, so he has to change the subject. He told us that the almost $900 billion in stimulus spending passed in 2009 would revive our economy and reduce unemployment to 6 percent. Three years later, unemployment stands at 8.2 percent.
She was first elected to the Assembly in 1980 and elected to the Senate in 1992. She won the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor in 1994 but lost in the general election to Gray Davis. Term limits forced her out of office in 2000.

She has apologized for the remark, as well she should, but ultimately, her moment of frustration is insignificant next to the question at hand. Mr. O'Malley had it right when he later sought to soften his wife's remark by explaining that sometimes when people are confronted with injustice "we respond with words of hurt rather than words of healing." The legislature now has a historic opportunity to right a painful wrong that has long denied Maryland's gay and lesbian couples the full exercise of their rights as citizens. We urge them to let the healing begin.

Peters could be placed on USA Gymnastics' permanently ineligible list if the USAG ethics and grievances committee rules that the sexual abuse charges are true.
For those who bought in and supported the franchise on the basis that players like T.J. Oshie, David Backes, David Perron, Roman Polak and Patrik Berglund were going to be a foundation of something good, they can feel at least somewhat rewarded for that trust. Blues officials who implored the fan base to believe in that future, also can feel some justification.

So Molnar got to peeling the squash with a knife -- no easy feat. We figured if she could get through law school, slicing a kabocha would be child's play.

Greg Little is here, he led our team in receptions, he caught a ton of balls and we think he is going to be better. He looks great right now and Mo (Mohamed Massaquoi) has to come back healthy. The rest of it, we'll have to figure out what happens here in the draft. I think that is a perfect example of where you have to be really, really careful. We want great players at every position, we really do, and that's our goal. To do something just to do something, and that position has been a little up and down in the league. If there is a good one out there, then hey, go get him."

Smith had flopped around like a boated salmon after Shaw hit him along the boards Saturday night. It was a terrible acting job by the Coyotes' goalie, who spun around, threw his gloves into the air and likely would have been heard screaming "Stella!" had he been miked.

The group said that the 2005 law – which says a person has "the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm" – has been inconsistently applied by law enforcement and the courts.
THE Met Museum’s VP historian Harold Holzer on paying this year’s taxes late: “Postponement dates to Abraham Lincoln, who introduced federal income tax in the first place. April 1862, the bill for which he is most famous lay unsigned on his desk for two days. So next Monday, with a last look at our 1040 forms, let us know April 16 is the day Lincoln signed the act to release the slaves in the District of Columbia.”

But making the parts wasn't the end of it. A year into the project, in late 2008, NASA decided that the titanium gears it had ordered Andrew Tool to build were too malleable a material to last through Curiosity's anticipated exploration lifetime.

Few travelers visited the tomb even before the Syrian government's violent crackdown on an uprising that began more than a year ago.

Reality: There may be a little truth in this one, but it all depends on the types of flu strain that are circulating each year. The flu vaccine is formulated based on which influenza virus strains are identified worldwide, how they spread and how the existing vaccine strains protect against them, according to the CDC. The seasonal vaccine contains three strains that protect against the three main families of virus that circulate in the population. Which one is most prevalent changes each year.

The Cavs earned two more victories than last season and improved their winning percentage from .232 to .318. They were competitive on the road and -- before the trade deadline -- their longest losing streaks measured four and six games. The relentless Varejao was enjoying an All-Star-caliber season prior to breaking his wrist Feb. 10. Antawn Jamison's ability to stretch the floor gave the Cavs a second scoring option and ensured Irving's drive-thru lane was open late into the night.

Dean said using taxpayer-backed bonds are a far more stable funding source than the existing proposal, which relies on an untested expansion of charitable gambling. He also acknowledged, one day after proposing a roof-less stadium, that a roof would likely be required to qualify for general obligation bonds. The lack of a roof would severely limit the facility's ability to host civic and other events year-round.

But he ran into a barrage of skeptical questions, including from some of the court’s liberals. Justice Stephen Breyer said he did not see why Arizona’s police would violate federal immigration law if they simply notified federal agents they had a possible illegal immigrant in custody. Breyer said he would be concerned only if the state said it could arrest and jail illegal aliens on its own.
Agency investigators found several samples of salmonella at the two farms, along with towers of manure and bug and rodent infestations.

"It's not an easy fix in this league," team president John Davidson said. "The growth of our players, the commitment by the staff . . . they've all grown together. We haven't won anything, we haven't gotten to where we want to get yet. ... But you feel that this is genuine. You feel that this team could compete with anybody in the game."
Your brother has chronic kidney failure. The kidneys are our filtration stations, cleaning the blood of waste materials and excess fluid. A test called creatinine clearance gives a reliable estimate of how well the kidneys are filtering the blood. Values above 90 ml/min (1.5 ml/s) indicate normal function. When the clearance falls to between 30 and 59 (0.5 and 0.98), that person has a moderate decrease in kidney function. Anything lower is severe, and that's the stage when dialysis or kidney transplant is considered.
The unemployment rate, stubbornly high at 9.4 percent, could climb higher as more people who stopped looking for work return to the job search. And few see enough jobs being created over the next year to help more than a small portion of the 8 million people who lost work during the recession.

Ken Peterson, communications director at the aquarium, said humpback and gray whale sightings are also possible.

Who says there isn’t anything new — or at least very old and still neglected — under the classical sun? Few publications and recordings have been devoted to the music of Alessandro Melani (1639-1703), who wrote both sacred works and opera in Rome before Alessandro Scarlatti. Nothing could make a better case for reviving Melani’s church motets than this album led by Rinaldo Alessandrini, who always invests early Italian repertoire with idiomatic sensitivity, coloristic richness and a personal, emotional verve. The 11-minute, texturally diverse “Litany for the Blessed Virgin” has long, piquantly dissonant vocal lines that are deeply expressive, particularly as sung by Concerto Italiano — whose beautiful tuning doesn’t preclude a very human warmth, with bass lute and organ as earthy underpinning.
Dr. Al Cofrancesco, director of the Corps' Invasive Species Center in Vicksburg, Miss., said invasive species are not a problem when they're in their native range.

SHED NO TEARS
A five-mile return trip lay before us, and the storms showed no signs of abating, but we didn’t mind. We had logged 40 miles without a wreck, a squabble or even a flat tire, with some great food in the bargain.

The phone, which also has face-detection capabilities, follows users' eye movements to keep the phone switched on.

--The major question mark surrounding the Wizards at this point is the future of Andray Blatche. Blatche has just completed his seventh season with the Wizards, and his performance has been a huge disappointment, even to Blatche himself. Grunfeld gave Blatche a contract extension through the 2014-15 season that pays him around $7 million per season, to the dismay of many Wizards fans, who have booed Blatche all season long. Blatche missed five weeks with a calf injury, then returned for nine games, but was so out of shape he was deactivated for the rest of the season. He missed 22 games in all, a third of the season.

Compostable bowls and plates: Made from sugarcane pulp waste, which is usually burned or tossed, these plain white dishes from Eco-Products won't stand out at a backyard barbecue. But they are grease resistant and both freezer and microwave-safe. Better yet, after use they can be thrown into the compost heap, where they disintegrate within two months.

The announcement that Steven Spielberg was turning "War Horse" into a movie blockbuster was something of a head-scratcher. How would he manage to translate a work that was notably in the theater chiefly for its majestic puppetry? The stage drama, adapted by Nick Stafford from a novel by Michael Morpurgo, won the 2011 Tony for best play, but the production's artistry was concentrated in the imaginative design and in particular the way the animals were animated through objects. Would Spielberg turn this into a bloody "National Velvet" crying jag by employing actual animals?

The second half of this seminar begins with a lecture entitled: Do I really need a drummer? The course is not suggested for drummers as it requires some light reading.
Mind you, this is not a discussion between believers and unbelievers. It's a widening gap between churched Christians and unchurched Christians. And if you think "unchurched Christian" is an oxymoron, I hear you. I tend to agree. Being adopted into the Body of Christ is one of the gifts of salvation. Why would you intentionally cut yourself off from the richness that is the church?

He openly campaigns with his superior, David Barlow (Brendan Gleeson) for a better assignment, but for the time being, he's stuck where he is.

Yet these filmmakers can't overcome the same problem creator Adam Herz faced in the previous three movies: The women  with the exception of the quirky Hannigan  are boring.

The little rectangle of puff pastry topped with paper-thin banana slices was gritty from undissolved sugar, and the banana fruit leather on the banana malt bombe was rubbery.

"Broadway used to be a great entertainment zone and it still is, but it is overrun by an edgier type of crowd on the weekend. The maitre d' at Enrico's on Saturday night wears a bulletproof vest," Joseph Alioto Jr. said. "The clubs are not taking enough responsibility, and the Entertainment Commission has not enforced the law."
Among her most popular topics: Mexican cooking. "An announcement that my lesson for the day would be Spanish dishes invariably brought record-breaking crowds in any city in the United States," she claimed in the introduction to her "California Mexican-Spanish Cook Book," published in 1914.
INDIANAPOLIS — There is an old Indiana legend about a fellow named Dad Jones who was hired back in the 1850s as a laborer during the building of the White Lick Creek Bridge just west of Indianapolis.

“Hagerstown caller, you leftists love to call us conservatives religious extremists, but now you actually equate criticizing President Obama or disagreeing with his policies to accusing Jesus — who, despite your fantasy, wasn’t a Democrat or a Republican or a politician, who said his kingdom wasn’t of this world — of being the devil or Satan’s agent. I’ve heard jokes about Obama worshippers, but until now that’s all I thought they were, but it sure sounds like you actually believe, regardless of facts and reality, that he’s the infallible messiah, and so in your mind any criticism, disagreement or dissent is heresy, blasphemy, and an insult to your faith. And caller, if your Obama worship wasn’t so laughably pathetic, I’d be offended that you’d equate our Lord and Savior to Obama or any other politician.”
Its a sad thing. Its hard to understand, said Bobby Beathard, who as Chargers general manager took Seau with the fifth pick overall in the 1990 draft. He was really just a great guy. If you drew up a player youd love to have the opportunity to draft and have on the team and as a teammate, Junior and Rodney (Harrison), theyd be the kind of guys youd like to have.
Almost all of the plans have been on the drawing boards for years, while others are recent additions required by changing rules, such as a state regulation on how much clean water cities must have on hand. That's forcing the city to make about $13 million in upgrades to the city Sewer Plant near Fairmount Park Racetrack.
"And we've got C.J. Wilson standing out here thinking about what he's going to throw,'' Holland said, rivaling Ferrell's Caray imitation. "We've got Mike Napoli giving the signals here. Holiday's just waiting. Here comes the delivery. Aaaah and a swing and a miss (actually a foul ball) now it's back to the old screen. We're going to have to get the ball back. What a throw back from the umpire. That was catcher Mike Nap-oli.''

"We are so cash-strapped," said Port of Newport Commission Chairwoman JoAnn Barton.

He never portrayed himself as a hero, his son said. Nor did he view himself as a radical. "I was not one of those angry young rebels, looking for a cause. I was one of those trying to make some sense of this, trying to come up with an explanation," he told the Associated Press in 2000.

His parents have tried to keep Jesse and their other three children out of the spotlight. Both parents declined comment, wanting to keep the focus on their son.
With a substantial portion of teenagers, and the majority of gay teens, saying they've been bullied, the issue is drawing attention as perhaps never before. Schools and legislatures are taking the offensive, celebrities are joining in and the media are treating the subject as society's business, not merely "kids being kids."
The other plaintiffs are from Orange County.
At the same time, Disney Co. executives have pledged to investors to reduce capital spending once the company completes a current slate of projects that includes the Hawaiian resort, two new cruise ships, and park expansions around the world.

"We feel very strongly that there is a for-sale market in University Circle, so I want to make that clear," Maron said, citing town houses being built on East 118th Street and in Little Italy. "In terms of moving this project forward, it's easier to point to buildings like Park Lane Villa and the existing Triangle buildings and see that there's clearly a market for residential rental buildings."
Sept. 29-Oct. 7 — China Open, Beijing, HO
Group members began by quietly conducting field research to prove, among other things, that China's fertility rate had fallen dangerously below the "replacement rate" of 2.1 children for every woman, which is generally required to keep a population stable. They calculated that the fertility rate should be 1.47 if the policy was implemented correctly, taking into account the various exemptions.
Later this summer, "Once," ''Nice Work If You Can Get It," and "Newsies" will compete for the title of best musical with a surprise entry -- "Leap of Faith," which was ravaged by critics.

That's fine with the University of San Francisco catcher, and his coach. Same with Dons pitcher Matt Hiserman, who survived a life-threatening skull fracture last February when he was hit with a line drive during an intrasquad game.
When it comes to the actual meeting, keep in mind that age makes all the difference in how they react to you. Kids under 8 are a little easier, while teenagers tend to be more difficult because they understand what’s going on. So in the beginning, I would keep it very light. Perhaps a brief meeting where she introduces you as “Mommy’s friend.” I might also bring them a little present (ask your girlfriend for a tip on what they might like). And if they aren’t overly excited, that’s OK. This is new to them, and it’s going to take time to gain their trust.

It all started with the 1998 publication of an article linking the two in the British journal The Lancet, although it wasn’t so much the research — the study involved just 12 children — as the lead author’s conviction, which caused the world-wide stir.

After falling behind early, the younger, quicker Nuggets picked up the pace and made a game of it. Now, they'll try to duplicate their up-tempo style to make this a competitive series.
Case was on to something. A confluence of political and market forces gave Honda Motor Co. its big break in the U.S. in the '70s. Consumers who were suddenly worried about gas prices snapped up fuel-efficient small cars like the Civic that Case and a handful of other Honda dealers were selling. The Japanese automaker has found success by offering Americans affordable, reliable gas-sippers ever since.

"I did not notice any humanity at all in what they have been saying," said Davis Young, the former president of Edward Howard and Co. and a nationally recognized marketing and media expert. "It's not rocket science. They need to say, 'If we confused you, we apologize.'
The Cardinals were back on the charge with 1:59 to play after Lincoln fumbled the ball at the South Laurel 25. Seven plays into the series, the Patriot sideline was celebrating after another Honaker pick but the change of possession was reversed on a holding penalty against the Patriots. Two plays later, Dethridge connected with Josh Brown on a 40-yard pass to get the Cardinals within 31-30.
These words of post-mortem guilt probably ring somewhat hollow to the alleged victims of David Wu.
"I had just missed a 3-pointer that could have given us a lead. I was wide open, too. So we had to foul with 4.1 seconds left. We called a play for after the free throws. Then the SEC Player of the Year, Ansu Sesay, missed both free throws. Go figure. The ball goes out of bounds and time went off the clock.

But Belle Isle exemplifies a sweet spot where state expertise can be useful pretty quickly, even if the island does not immediately, or ever, take the full leap to becoming a state park. Beyond basic maintenance, which the city can barely sustain, the island needs the kind of assessment and ability to convene and sort through community interests that the DNR has the expertise to develop.
If you are Mr. Romney, this has got to be maddening. What does it take for the former Massachusetts governor to close the deal with conservatives? No doubt he'll produce a stronger showing in New Hampshire next week, but that will be discounted as his home turf. Perhaps South Carolina will seal the deal on Jan. 21, but probably not. There's always Florida 10 days later. Oh, well.
Second, show the real icons some respect. Yes, it seemed very real when co-host Anne Hathaway gushed over some of the legends she was about to introduce. It also seemed like a letdown when those “legends” only turned out to be Oprah Winfrey and Sandra Bullock.
At first, she didn't want to play again. Then, she thought about how her mother was a passionate player herself, and how she had never fulfilled the dream of playing in college.

"I've told a few people that I think playing at Autzen is the most intimidating atmosphere that I've experienced," said Oliver Luck, the West Virginia athletic director and father of Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.

Except that's simply not true. It's not remotely true. A new rule from the Obama administration's EPA will, according to an Associated Press analysis, force 32 mostly coal-fired power plants to shut down and threatens to close 36 others. Moreover, the new "blackout" rule will effectively prevent the creation of any new coal-fired plants in America unless they adopt new technologies that will make it unprofitable to burn coal at all. So there's that.

Malama, which means "care for" or "maintain," became our friends' first Hawaiian word. A few of the polyglot campers even started using mauka (toward the mountains) and makai (toward the sea) for directions, east-west-north-south being almost worthless on an island whose geography is as jagged as Oahu's.

"I like helping," he said. "I want to help keep the city nice, and there's often a lot to cover up."
"Inside Deep Throat" is full of groovy music and comic charactersmany with a priceless reaction to Lovelace's oral party trickbut it hardly manages to say anything new or thoughtful. Just as Bailey and Barbato gave Monica Lewinsky a pass in their HBO doc, "Monica in Black and White," they gloss over anything complicated and instead concentrate on making the good guys look good and the bad guys look bad, so we can all pat ourselves on the back afterward for being so open minded.
No matter what, the wine should always be sweeter than the dessert. Otherwise, the wine can taste dull and acidic. This means that for good wine pairings, desserts should not be pure sugar-fests. Serve very sweet desserts with coffee and tea.
