But I do wish that police in Portland and around the country would think twice about their own contribution to the fear they see in a black woman's eyes when she instinctively pulls her son close to her while simply walking past a white officer on the street. It doesn't happen all the time, all black mothers are not the same, and there are plenty of good and dedicated white police officers. My husband's grandfather was one. But those good officers owe all those worried black mothers a little respect for that fear, and some public assurance they will try to never let something like this happen in Portland again.

øThe proposal has been tweaked clearly with an eye toward attracting more Eastern support. Hockey Night in Canada's Elliotte Friedman reported Saturday night that the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning are now being lumped with the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs, Buffalo Sabres, Ottawa Senators and Boston Bruins. That would seem like it would be attractive to the Florida teams because of the number of Canadians who spend winters in Florida. The Carolina Hurricanes and Washington Capitals now would be with the New York Islanders and Rangers, New Jersey Devils, Pittsburgh Penguins and Flyers. It's a logical approach.

The time is 1912, the place a saloon-flophouse somewhere in the depths of lower Manhattan. The lights come up on a stageful of snoring, dilapidated drunks who are clinging to the end of their collective rope. This is, one of them says, "the No Chance Saloon.

Although he had played in punk and hardcore bands, González reverted to the nylon-string classical guitar with which he had accompanied his father when he started playing at age 14. Spare, rhythmic bossa nova and Cuban approaches to fingerstyle guitar, plus four years of classical training, gave González impeccable technical grounding on the instrument. When Drake's use of alternate tunings and steadily repeated bass lines (much like those of bossa nova) entered the picture, González began writing the songs that he documented on his first EP, Crosses. The positive reaction to Crosses inspired González to abandon his Ph.D. studies in biochemistry, finish his debut full-length CD (Veneer, released in Europe in 2003 and issued in the United States earlier this year by Mute) and devote himself to performing and recording.

"Risk-on persists. It's bullish for Asian equities, which means confidence-sensitive capital inflows," Tim Condon, head of Asian economic research at ING Financial Markets Research, said in a note to clients.

She needed to remind the world that, as the San Juan newspaper el Imparcial declared in 1953, "Nuestros hijos no son cobardes!"
Then the meat is sliced thinly, covered with mango chutney, bell peppers and beef stock, then put in the oven. This is different than what I'm used to. Usually, the entire tenderloin in kept intact until after the roasting to preserve the juiciness. But Chaccour tells me this is done  and done quickly  to infuse the flavors of the chutney and peppers and stock into an otherwise lean and limited cut of pork.
When Angelina Jolie starts running through the streets in one of her action roles, chasing or being chased, her arms in some kind of accelerated wind-chopping motion, it looks sort of plausible - and there are jump cuts and stunt doubles and whooshy beats to heighten the effect.

Star turn: In the episode aired Feb. 7, Chin Ho touts the popularity of Liliha Bakery coco puffs — a frosted puff pastry with chocolate cream filling — to Danno with a logo box beside him. Unlike the lame "Bing it" references, this product placement apparently came free of charge; the show's producers reportedly approached the venerable Honolulu bakery.

Not that Helms didn’t get emotional about it, and sometimes even feel a little guilty about his own work — particularly when doing the show’s "field pieces," improvised bits of lunacy in which, taking on the character of a clueless "Daily Show correspondent," one of the staffers would go out and interview a politician or self-styled expert, calmly asking the most ridiculous and often insulting questions.

Morsi, who in 1982 received a doctorate in engineering from USC, faces his sharpest challenges from Moussa and Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh, whose progressive strand of Islam led to his expulsion from the Brotherhood last year.

The pair -- lifelong friends since they were little more than toddlers -- bought the hotel in the then-crumbling oceanfront neighborhood of Nye Beach in 1984. For the next three years, they worked to transform the decrepit flophouse into a beach-worthy retreat. The windows were broken, the roof in tatters and rain leaked in everywhere.

Our input should have been solicited into that decision so that they understood what the impact was going to be."
Steak tartare ($15), topped with a raw egg yolk, comes molded onto a brioche bun; the meat is exceptional but the bun is doughy. I had a similar problem with the duck pastrami ($6), tender, rosy slices of cured breast meat with a whole-seed mustard, a knob of sauerkraut, and fingers of rye toast that tasted stale. Everett also makes fennel sausage ($6), bresaola with pickled vegetables ($8) and other charcuterie.

Aside from the title character, who makes one of his entrances upon a puppet-like steed, and his beloved (and official Disney Princess) Jasmine, the show includes the boisterous blue Genie, the smart-mouthed bird Iago, handled by an on-stage puppeteer a la "Avenue Q," the evil Jafar and a carpet, played enthusiastically, yet silently, by an acrobatic actor.

The big issue, however, isn't the arcane process for shedding teachers, but what the process says about the inefficient way that most Americans have decided to educate their kids. As the LAO reports, decisions about who stays and who goes are based on which teachers have showed up to work for the most years – i.e., seniority – rather than which ones are most effective and energetic. The hearing and appeals process, by which every laid-off teacher gets an automatic hearing, adds enormous costs to a system that always claims to lack enough resources.
A Monday posting provided updates on his condition: "The brain fluid that was sent to pathology was cultured and showed bacteria beginning to grow. They started Roger on two antibiotics to cover this bacteria growth. They also started to give Roger blood thinners today to prevent clots. Doctors plan to perform a tracheotomy and place a feeding tube in Roger on Tuesday which will allow them to slowly take him off of the ventilator . . . Doctors have used words like 'miracle' so far - especially when it comes to Roger surviving the initial brain injuries that he suffered. Also the fact that his neck and brain arteries are in stable condition are a miracle.:

The groups ran ad campaigns, toured around the country holding protests and tried to help organize workers. They attempted to block Wal-Mart from opening new stores in places like New York City even while competitors like Target were greeted with fanfare.

While meeting with Sinja (and doing yoga in full business attire — stop, you’re killing me, it’s all too wacky), Jack cuts his hand on a tree that later appears in his own yard. Every time Jack says or writes a word, a leaf falls off the tree, and when consulted, the holy man figures that there are a thousand leaves left, and when they’re all gone, Jack will die.
Metro last month held a series of workshops on long-range plans which drew about 400 people. MetroLink remained the most popular expansion mode. Officials said they were surprised by the number of participants who were willing to favor bus rapid transit and expanded bus service, particularly after they learned how expensive extending MetroLink would be.
And he went through a divorce, followed by a long bachelorhood, and then started another marriage.
"I keep hoping we'll get a phone call one day telling us who's working the case," he said.
Alan Schwanke’s set may not suggest the early British world, but with what looks like the concrete foundation of some kind of industrial structure, an overhanging skylight and walls of pipe and hanging plastic, one gets the sense of the Piano Player’s gray, empty unpoetic modern world –- one much in need of the exotic stories that Shakespeare has given us, especially this one in which human hope and possibility is the final focus.
The first concerns our continued unwillingness to explore an area estimated to produce greater than 1 million barrels of oil a day and 150 billion cubic feet of natural gas per year beneath the North Slope of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The land was purchased for oil and natural gas development by President Jimmy Carter and Congress. As a member of Congress assigned to the Commerce Committee, I visited the proposed development site to learn firsthand about the issue. The proposed drilling footprint is small (less than 3 percent of ANWR's total acreage) under a House passed bill earlier this year. The area is predominantly dreary, barren wasteland. Indeed, the area is not designated as wilderness. Yet, the North Slope remains untouched to this day.
“I’m a big animal lover,” said Croghan. “I’ve always had dogs. I like seeing the animals in the library and seeing the reactions people have to seeing animals in the library. It’s usually a good reaction.”

"The encouraging piece is that we can respond to it, and the disturbing piece is that there are 500 incidents," Brice said. "We want a school system where there are no incidents. Until we get to that point, we recognize that we still have a lot of work left to do."
The announcement is a proposal, and it could be several years before and schools are required to make changes.

When a newspaper posed the question "What's Wrong with the World?", G.K. Chesterton, novelist and theologian, reportedly answered: "I am." The implication that if you're not putting things right then you're part of what's wrong inspired filmmaker Tom Shadyac (say Shady-ack) to make the nonfiction film I Am. A sincere and engaging series of encounters with the likes of Bishop Desmond Tutu, journalist Lynne McTaggart, and evolutionary biologist Elizabet Sahtouris, it is Shadyac's personal inquiry into the nature of what's wrong with the world and how to make it better.
New Jersey has volunteers who have given their time to fighting the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the United States.
Earnhardt has five career wins at the Alabama track, none since 2004, but he pushed teammate Jimmie Johnson to the win there last April while sacrificing his own shot at a victory. Earnhardt settled for second, and he was second in this year's season-opening Daytona 500, a restrictor-plate race just like Talladega.
"The locker rooms are pretty much getting a complete facelift. There will be a lot of upgrades," Puckett said. "We're adding a strength and conditioning room, some therapy areas and more offices."
The animal was spotted by a resident who said it was drooling and unafraid of humans. The resident reported it to police, who killed the animal and sent it to the state health laboratory for testing. The results came back today as positive for rabies.
The House vote capped an on-again, off-again struggle by House GOP leaders to pass their own five-year transportation plan. They were forced to abandon plans to bring the bill to the floor last month because of divisions in their own ranks. Opting instead for a short-term extension, they repeatedly canceled votes on first a three-month and then a two-month extension this week before deciding to put the three-month bill to a vote on Thursday.
Then his editor urged him to start tweeting. Hough took to the format, tweeting about everything from people on the street to food. A recent tweet: "Just ordered a @WarbyParker monocle. I would only use it for late-19th century music though."

Celebrate the menu's cultural mishmash when you're dressing your table. We started with modern white square plates from Z Gallerie. Next, layer on a pink napkin. Add a nod to English frivolity with Rosanna's girly dessert plates from the French Bee and rosannainc.com. The small celadon square plate is from Super L Ranch Market at the Chinese Cultural Center. We topped our stack with all the utensils one could possibly need: an Asian soup spoon from Cost Plus World Market, pink chopsticks from mrslinskitchen.com, and Cath Kidston flatware from Melrose Vintage. For finishing touches, we tucked a fortune cookie in a small lotus flower bowl from Target, and set an egg cup filled with hydrangea nearby. The martini glasses are from Macy's.

Life's a beach and then you die? Not if you're paying attention...to posted warnings, current ocean conditions, the knowledge (or absence) of lifeguards and local beachgoers, and your own physical limitations. Most beaches are perfectly fine for sightseeing from the sand, and many have waters that can be entered safely on calm days, applying all the above-mentioned cautions. Sadly, every island has a sirenlike shoreline where risks are all too often unheeded.
"I would say it's not a stepping stone," Charles said. "Think about it, for example, have you ever had a superintendent leave here to go to another job?"
"It’s certainly something that I feel is going to add to the transparency of the department," said Police Director Samuel DeMaio, who will formally announce Wednesday that the cameras are now in 52 cruisers. "On the flip side, I think it’s also a safety measure that protects our officers."
Deng only made a splash during the introductions for the reserves. Instead of wearing the regular warmup top, Deng, who was born in South Sudan, sported a T-shirt with a picture of the African continent.
Kelly said Wednesday that he's moved away from scouting services altogether. There was also an intentional emphasis from the UO football program to classify a line of recruits not with a position, but as playing the position: "ATHLETE." That's new. But telling.

“Obviously a lot of their guys in the lineup are hot right now," Humber said after the Sox's 10-3 loss. "I didn’t pitch well tonight. They did a good job of hitting bad pitches. Definitely not my best day, for sure.
"Tenure is designed for the good teacher that is being railroaded out," said Mike Wood, who lobbies for the Missouri State Teachers Association. "It's not to protect the bad teacher."
The organization was one of several public interest groups that sued the FDA last May to press for strict rules on antibiotic usage on farms. The FDA produced the new voluntary guidelines independently from the lawsuit. But a federal judge ruled last month that the FDA must act on the issue, and that the new guidelines would not excuse the FDA from reviewing its approval of antibiotics used on healthy animals. Legal proceedings are under way to determine the next step.
To the Wyatts, feeling good about what they're doing is their main reason for starting an urban farm: "I want to contribute to farmers markets as they should be," says Brett. "It makes us happy."
It wasn't until Briggs finally reached for an Arizona hat that he was sure of his commitment.
"If this is the only race I ever win in my life, it's a good one," he said.
Almost all the events I mention in this column are free. Our struggling artists and institutions have found creative ways of continuing to produce art and present exhibitions. Just "cutting back" and "getting creative" are not always enough. Recently, some of our local institutions have made changes just to survive: Maitland's art center and historical association merged to form the Art & History Museums, Maitland; and the Brevard Museum of Art is now part of the Florida Institute of Technology and known as the Foosaner Art Museum.
Eli Manning is okay (no emails please, that was sarcasm) and David Carr turned down more money to return as a backup, so the Giants don't have a pressing need here. Of course, they've been trying for some time to develop a late-round pick they could eventually trade for higher/more selections (think Matt Hasselbeck, Matt Schaub, etc.). One possibility is Southern Miss' Austin Davis, a projected sixth-round pick who visited the team over the weekend after solid showings at the NFL Scouting Combine and his pro day.
CBS, which has long been successful in drawing older viewers, also had the week's most-watched program among viewers ages 2-11 and 6-11, a rerun of the animated special "Rudolph the Red-Nose Reindeer," which was seventh overall, averaging 12.2 million viewers.

Pacific's partnership with Operation Hope + Financial Beginnings is helping to rectify a deficit of financial education in Washington County by training more volunteer financial educators and deploying them to classrooms and community groups. This fall, Pacific hosted a volunteer workshop that trained 19 new financial educators for Operation Hope + Financial Beginnings. This spring, Pacific's Business Administration Department offered a new course, "Community Financial Literacy," in which students earned course credit for teaching the basics of budgeting, banking, credit, investment, and insurance to others.
Most of the practices have already been used to save money in the towns that have adopted them, Pozycki said. The ordinances were developed by a task force that will continue to meet and come up with additional suggestions, he said.

One of those changes was to exclude folks who had reverse mortgages, given that there was a chance the program might never be repaid with the mortgage acting as a first lien. "The program depends for its economic survival on being repaid."
The Capital Square Review and Advisory Board, which handles building management for the Statehouse, told us that no one had defecated in the Statehouse. Someone did defecate in a stairwell that connects an underground parking garage with a heated shelter where people wait for buses and homeless people sometimes congregate.
Polls show President Obama running well ahead of the presumptive GOP presidential candidate among Latino voters -- 64% to 24% in one recent poll. But as Romney arrived in Arizona today, the chairman of the state Republican Party said he believes Romney can -- and must -- reach out to Latinos.

In an Albuquerque hospital, my aunt is now receiving legally the opioids she so desperately sought on the streets. The family members that surround her hospital bed — the very ones that begged her to get clean — now ask her doctors to give her more drugs to ease her pain, and perhaps even offer her a hint of pleasure.
The teacher, Tera Myers, requested the leave Friday after a student approached her about her past, according to the district. Previously, Myers had been suspended from a Kentucky school district for similar reasons.

Bertuccelli's first film, 2003's Cannes-winning Since Otar Left, similarly dealt with a family coping, or not coping, with a loved one's death. Despite the potential for some supernatural grandiosity, the tone here remains understated and quiet, and Gainsbourg's performance feels lived-in, and deep, and right.
Two hipster friends, a gay man and a straight woman, fall simultaneously for a newcomer in this peculiar romantic triangle.

Christie announced the proposed changes to the state’s Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights, which would also create a seven-member task force that would draw up guidance for school districts in implementing the law.
Davis, the executive director of the National Freedom of Information Coalition, is as strong a free-press advocate as anyone I know. He thinks a subsidy, whether it's done with tax credits or through an entity like the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, could be structured in a way that doesn't compromise journalists' independence.
For current state employees, the panel expands the number of plans from three to 15, including five PPOs and 10 HMOs, including two high-deductible options, Treasury summaries showed.
In boom years, pay raises might make sense. But these are bust years. State funding cuts have forced the trustees to raise mandatory fees and tuition for next fall to $7,017 - double what CSU cost just five years ago. Also, to save money, CSU has announced it will accept no new admissions in the spring semester. When a university system has to turn away qualified students and raise tuition for those admitted, it should not be asking everyone - except the highest-paid executives - to sacrifice.
"With all the injuries, we kind of got separated," Roy said "Not in a bad way, but guys just selfishly focused on getting themselves back to help the team. And I think we divided a lot. One guy got hurt, then another guy got hurt. Next thing you know, we have eight guys hurt -- including myself -- and we're all thinking about getting better.

Hitchcock, 60, was born and raised in Sherwood Park and Sutter estimated that it was about 80 miles from Viking. The two have been coaching against each other in the NHL since Sutter was in San Jose and Hitchcock in Dallas. Well before that, Hitchcock first remembered watching Sutter play in Sutter's junior hockey days. Sutter is seven years younger.
Kunik is mostly goat's milk, with Jersey cow's cream added to enrich it and bring it to triple-cream status (by convention, at least 75 percent butterfat in the dry matter - the cheese minus its water). Goat's milk is naturally homogenized - it doesn't separate easily - so adding cream from cow's milk is one way to boost the fat content.
The plan was endorsed by Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, other prominent black leaders, big-name Democrats and labor leaders.
Tracy was cited in 2008 for working outside approved boundaries on an earlier BLM mine, but officials say he appropriately remedied the damage. He also mined on a site previously restored by BLM -- the agency had placed logs strategically in the river and planted trees streamside. But despite staff concerns, Tracy was allowed under the 1872 law to mine on the restored site, Whittington says.

A document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal shows in one case, Cardinal Health sold the cancer drug fluorouracil to LTC Pharmacy of Durham, N.C., then licensed by the state to provide medications to long-term care facilities. LTC transferred the drug to International Pharmaceuticals Inc., a North Carolina distributor, the document said. The latter two are owned by the same person, Jessica Hoppe. Ms. Hoppe declined to talk about the companies but said they have been shut down.
