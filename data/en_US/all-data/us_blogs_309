“Catch,” the warning comes just in time to alert the General Gabriel to attention and warrior that he is he is quick to react just as the young Elven maiden is knocked from the tree that he has chosen to stand under, catching her as she falls. When blue eyes meet silver each know they have met their Life Mate, but such things as not as quickly accepted as they are recognized. He would have order in his ranks, she must be free to mark her own trail, he would bind her, tie her, control her. She would test his patience and will to the limit, and challenge his rights to own what she would not give freely.

Jonah is riding across the west searching for clues to the location of Emmy Lou. He comes across a lovely woman trick riding but her horse is suddenly spooked by a rattler and she is thrown, however her foot is caught in a stirrup. As she is being dragged, Jonah overtakes her horse, jumps upon it and brings it to a stop. He helps her to her feet and much later fixes her dinner around the campfire.
Where does it end? If we are bad parents for allowing alcohol to influence the coffers of the school treasury what else can we do? Can we sell chocolates to raise money? Nup. Fat kids. How about raffle tickets? Nup. Short step from ‘3 tickets for $5’ to ‘Honey I Blew The Grocery Money On A Sure Thing at The TAB’. What about hot cross buns? Don’t upset the Muslims. Or the fat kids.

As a result of the *conversation between Zuleikha and Potiphar*, Joseph was made the head servant in Potiphar’s household. This caused resentment among the other servants, for Joseph had so newly arrived. This resentment added to the burden of being head servant.
21 by Adele took two years to write. It reached #1 in 27 different charts worldwide and went platinum in 22. Every six and half seconds, someone somewhere in the world buys or downloads one of Adele’s two albums. The North London-born singer really is flying the flag for British talent across the globe. Therefore, she deserves every single bit of recognition she gets. Her reaction was fully justified as she did could not express her gratitude.

The loneliness of Obama’s New York existence emerged in his letters to Alex McNear, a young woman from Occidental who had enchanted Obama when she was co-editing the literary magazine Feast, and with whom he reconnected when she spent the summer of 1982 in New York. Alex had always been fond of Barry, as she called him, and “thought he was interesting in a very particular way. He really worked his way through an idea or question, turned it over, looked at it from all sides, and then he came to a precise and elegant conclusion.” When Alex came to New York, she gave Obama a call. They met at an Italian restaurant on Lexington Avenue, and, as she remembered the night, “we sat and talked and ate and drank wine. Or at least I drank wine. I think he drank something stronger. It was one of those dark, old Italian restaurants that don’t exist in New York anymore. It was the kind of place where they leave you alone. I remember thinking how happy I felt just talking to him, that I could talk to him for hours. We walked slowly back to my apartment, on 90th, and said good-bye. After that we started spending much more time together.”
That said… I do enjoy cooking. On a sailboat it’s a little bit more challenging. We do a lot of cooking, particularly in the winter with a Crockpot. We love it… with beer. We’ll put a pork roast in with sauerkraut and bratwurst… I’ve poached salmon in beer... with a bay leaf and a little paprika...

The '93 Topps Stadium Club product was a premium product that showcased superb photography and a high gloss surface. Sure laugh now, but take a look at a '91 Hoops card and you'll appreciate what Topps did with its '93 TSC release. To go along with its awesome 400 card base set, TSC also inserted a 21 card set into its series 2 boxes at a rate of 1:36. The TSC Beam Team insert set was truly a masterpiece of its time. The Beam Team set features the great photography found in the base set and combines it with the best stars from a hugely popular NBA and cool design. Some of the action shots Topps came up with for this set are really tremendous. Just look at the Dominique Wilkins card. Simply Awesome!
Thanks for reading and have a great week.
and spend like cash. The winner cannot receive change from Bash Bucks, and they cannot be split up to spend at two different booths. For example, if you want an $8 item, you must pay with your $10 Bash Bucks and forfeit the remaining $2 since change cannot be made. Additionally, you cannot spend that remaining $2 at a different vendor's booth.
In addition, going free on Amazon usually results in a better ranking on the paid side when you come off free than you had right before you went free. Because of the way Amazon displays its Bestseller lists differently across the site, if folk aren't interested in free books or don't know where to look for them, it's possible they'll never see them. That means once a book comes off the free list, you want it with the best rank possible -- generally in the Top 100 of its categories -- so that the folk who only search the paid Bestseller lists will see your book and possibly buy it.
From my research (thanks Google) it seems as if variety is key and green leafy vegetables such as spinach, collard greens, Kale, swiss chard, parsley etc are the best for blending and mixing into fruit so that you want to keep going back for more.

My mother was happy when she sewed. "You’re going to love it", she would say, smiling, "As soon as I saw that material, I knew it was exactly the right shade to bring out the green in your eyes." Or, "Princess Anne has a dress just like the one I‘m making you. I saw it in my magazine." In a trifling, I’d imagine myself in my new dress, feeling beautiful as the material floated around me.

Since Brilliant Orange was published in 2001, that’s where Winner has to leave the story. The zenith of total football was the Dutch national team of 1974 who lost 2-1 to Germany in a heartbreaking World Cup final. Total football is a stylish way to play but it’s yet to be proven that it’s a successful way to play – at least if success is measured by trophies.

Register on their site – it’s free, complete the form about which documents you want compared, pay the fee for the service (around £50) and then send them a letter containing photocopies of the original documents (diplomas, certificates etc – don’t forget to include the school/uni/course transcript) and, to make their task easier and your costs lower, include photocopies of translations of your documents. You will get their response in at least 15 days.

The beers on cask and keg do tend towards the pale, IPA and lagerly beers with a couple of porters. All are very well kept; indeed the selection seemed to sell very well as the place soon became packed with lots of people after varying beers. Sadly the only dark beers on the bar were Porterhouse’s Plain Porter, which I found to be bland; by bland I mean it was exactly like Guinness and Meantime’s London which is ok, better than the other but still not one I would willingly go for. But given at least they had two dark beers on its better than what a lot of other pubs do.

We can see historically that the patriarchal family (both in its pre-capitalist and capitalist forms) is a compost heap that gives root to the authoritarian psychology that can be manipulated and turned against a revolutionary working class. In Aotearoa this has a long history as petty-bourgeois and farming families facing the disorder of the frontier, the land wars, and the volatility of agriculture have often been used (by reactionary politicians, etc) to whip up fear and repression of both Maori Whanau and iwi such as Parihaka and Tuhoe and working class families during periods of class struggle.

This inter-ethnic match-up could be the week’s most entertaining game. The Chiefs were Plains warriors who held white intruders at bay for nearly a century before succumbing to disease and forced relocation.

It would be interesting to live in a city, at least for a few weeks, ruled by an insane urban zoning board who require all new buildings—both residential and commercial—to include elaborate artificial caves. Not elevator shafts or emergency fire exits or public playgrounds: huge fake caves torquing around and coiling through the metropolis. Caves that can be joined across property lines; caves that snake underneath and around buildings; caves that arch across corporate business lobbies in fern-like sprays of connected chambers. Plug-in caves that tour the city in the back of delivery trucks, waiting to be bolted onto existing networks elsewhere. From Instant City to Instant Cave. Elevator-car caves that arrive on your floor when you need them. Caves on hovercrafts and helicopters, detached from the very earth they attempt to represent.

I've been pretty busy the past couple of weeks, but I have not forgotten about Dreadrock. I have sections 1-2 and 1-3 mapped out already. I am currently working on keying 1-2, which is taking a bit because of the density of the rooms. There must be 50 rooms in this one, many of which are simply empty, but the map is big, so it's taking me a little longer to get it done.
Returning briefly to Daniel 2, it seems that if the stone strikes the image/statue on earth, fills the earth, and becomes a mountain on earth, the only contextual indicators suggest that the earth has become God’s domain and the place where his “holy ones” operate from.
I have realized lately that she is really missing the amount of physical touch I used to give her. I am snuggly, cuddly and full of affection and right now I have a baby attached to my body several hours a day and a pump the rest of the time. I've noticed that I am craving that snuggle time with her, and am determined to get more. We have started going into a different room from the babies and reading together, or just laying on the couch and talking.
I think there was even more food than this, but here's an example of what we ate. I was being cheered on very strongly by Sampath (the king), so I did a decent job cleaning off my leaf.

So, you’d think I’d be eager to prove him wrong and jump back with both feet on the Optifast product bandwagon! But later that day I pulled the three-year-old in a wagon to a nearby Denny’s for dinner only to realize that I had once again “forgotten” product, which now was seeming unconsciously deliberate – like a Freudian slip. Twice in one day?? And then once there I again put aside any thoughts of a glass of milk and ordered some “fit dinner” offering which included chicken, broccoli, corn, and salad. The most “real food” I’ve eaten in three months! There wasn’t so much as a kernel of corn left on my plate. Oops

7:00- Dinner is done and Heath does the dishes for me. Another chore he started doing when I was breastfeeding that stuck. I love that he does this because he spends some time with the kids to keep them out of my hair while I'm fixing dinner and I play with them while he does the dishes. The weather is nice so me and the kids head out to the back yard while daddy finishes up the dishes. Sometimes if we finish dinner early, we will go for a walk around the neighborhood, but since dinner took a little longer to cook, we stay at home.

The editor of Sakai's newspaper believes that the military cannot do anything against Godzilla and discusses it with Sakai and Junko. Jiro, another reporter who loves to eat eggs, walks in and suggests that Mothra might be able to defeat Godzilla. Sakai and Junko are skeptical that the island would agree because atomic testing had destroyed most of their island, and they had failed to return the egg to them.
Let me revive her briefly here. A tiny woman with a big voice, she would qualify for being what P G Woodhouse would call 'a bit on the tobasco side as a young woman'. Red-haired and red in her politics, she was a founding member of the British Communist Party in 1920, entered parliament in 1924 as a Labour member for Middlesborough East, lost her seat in 1931 but returned in 1935 as member for Jarrow.
At the back of all this is the person who really does have a day job. There are plenty of people who are teachers, farmers, accountants and so on who have a steady income and also write. But that doesn't mean their time is not valuable! They are writing instead of playing with their children, watching television, visiting friends. If a publisher intends to make money from that person's writing, they should pay a fair rate for it. Anything else is exploitation. Fiction is tricky - writers write at different rates. I write at different rates! I have written a book that has taken ten years and a book that has taken two hours. Of course a publisher can't pay an advance of £400,000 because it took you 10 years to write your novel. What is not acceptable is for a publisher who wants to produce (say) an A level guide to budget £400 for the author, knowing that it means someone with at least degree-level skills in that subject will have to work for less than £5 an hour to do it, even if they do have a 'day job' that pays the bills. It's less than the minimum wage.

The Charcoal House sits on a small lot with a narrow plan. It is not a spacious house to live in, but an avant-garde mind that seeks an alternative living space is perhaps looking for a change in effects. A modern house is about a modern living style, and the Charcoal House is an attempt to provide that chance for Torontonians.

I've stayed there and I just love the design, the layout, the atmosphere and the setting. Designed and built by Sir Clough William-Ellis supposedly in the style of an Italian village it resembles no Italian village that I’ve ever seen, no, not even Portofino! But it has a generally exotic atmosphere suggestive of different worlds and distant places, a kind of Platonic Mediterranean settlement, an ideal, if you like, in stone. I was there under a leaden sky, not a southern one, which simply added to the charm and general sense of unreality.

The original Stonewall campaign “Some people are Gay, get over it!” is a simple, non-discriminative announcement that not all people are the same and we should be inclusive of everyone. The campaign by Anglican Mainstream and The Core Issues Trust, promoted that being Gay is unnatural, a disease and could be cured. This is discriminatory, belittling and has great negative connotations. Thus I stand by the decision to have it removed and barred from London Transport.
The Woman in Black (2012) sounds, on paper, like your average time-wasting supernatural horror flick. And to be honest. The only reason I actually wanted to see the movie was to watch Daniel Radcliffe twist and turn in horror. Unfortunally his character wasn’t boring like that… he was instead stupid enough to, again and again, face the vicious ghost head on.

Needless to say, now that I have moved so far from home, the combination of these two things makes it very difficult to recreate the food from my childhood. I oftentimes will call her up to ask her how to make something and I get a list of ingredients (without amounts), vague directions, and no cooking times. So, I am basically left on my own to make the recipe over and over again until I finally get it to turn out the way I remember it. Luckily, I consider this a labor of love.
This brings up a factor that IMO is too often overlooked: Mass incarceration takes consumers out of circulation in the economy. Clearly TDCJ's 160,000 inmates represent a significant amount of buying power and taking them out of circulation reduces overall consumer demand. For serious offenders who would victimize others if they got out, that calculus makes sense: For the petty drug addict or thief, perhaps not so much.

The sexuality of Heather Morris in this video is unbelievable. The constant head, hip and body rolls mixed with quick cuts creates a great deal of intensity keeping the audience glue to Heather Morris’s every move. As Glee is not necessarily known for being overly sexual, it was refreshing to see the choreographers staying true to who this show was dedicated to: Britney Spears. B. Spears radiates sex and it was refreshing to see that the producers honored that.

We hit the road again and it was about 9:30 pm by now and we were headed north-east towards Wisconsin. This is when we started getting the radio warnings again. Severe thunder storms that were the length of entire states… producing hail, more seventy mile per hour winds, extreme rain and extreme lightning. As we continued driving, we started moving more into the system. In fact, we were travelling pretty much in the same direction as the system. Lightning was flashing and the thunder was HARD, literally right above us for about two hours. We seriously thought we were going to get hit. A semi-truck across the street was struck by a massive bolt, not 50 yards away from us. Then we later saw something just off the road get struck. There was so much lightning you could read a book with the amount of light it was producing.

One of the things that I really loved about this Kdrama is that the lead characters started on being friends and really was able to get to know each other’s TRUE character that lead to LOVE. I truly liked Jin Ho and Gae In’s interactions as they get to progress from friends to more than friends. They really planted the seed well inside my system though it really took a lot of nurturing before I finally saw the plant, I mean pairing, and appreciated it. Who can deny the chemistry? Not me.

Aquí os traigo mi nueva colaboración: El set de Hat WWII American Tank Riders. El set incluye cuatro matrices idénticas con once soldados en cada una de ellas, dos “conductores” , y nueve tripulantes respectivamente, entre los que destacan uno llevando un bazooka y otro con una ametralladora de gran calibre. También hay otro que lleva a la espalda lo que, supongo, es la munición del bazooka. También incluye un oficial arrodillado con unos prismáticos en la mano. Todas las miniaturas son de una pieza excepto una que está arrodillada y te da la opción de elegir ente dos armas automáticas o semiautomática.

All the figures are one part, except one, which haves an option for an arm, wearing an automatic or semi-automatic weapon.
I used Paulette's word art from TLC Creations (a past freebie!) with Hambo Stamps' Heart Basket. Click on the photo and you can see the Starfire Glitter I added to the hearts.

It is layered on Riding Hood Red CS cut out with a Spellbinders Rectangle Nestie, but the edges are hard to see against the Red Prints DP. I colored my basket with Copic markers. The printed ribbon and red brads are from Hobby Lobby. I paper pierced the upper lefthand corner. Not bad for what was "lying around."

The two rules of thumb I use in these situations are 1) Is the person close to you and typically a source of emotional support? and 2) is this person able to hear and make good use of constructive feedback? If the answer to both of these questions is no, then thinking about or responding to what they say is often a waste of your energy.

Investigations in France have recently unconvered new commissions paid, some of which are rumoured to be as large as the 114 million euros or RM570 million already paid out to Baginda’s Perimekar firm.
“We know more than the Department of Labor does,” Rieckhoff says. “Data is essential to understanding the issues, to identifying the problems and creating the products that can help them.”
It is important to remember that each person deals with grief differently and on a unique basis, so individualistic needs should be met rather than grouped together under one expectation. Management should be made aware of individual circumstances, and proper actions should take place if it is affecting the work environment. Again, use HR for assistance with any employee assistance programs, or possible FMLA (Family Medical Leave of Absence) or vacation days. Every company has a bereavement policy that can also be obtained from the HR Dept.
Again, my question is simply this: Why are those following the law penalized, while those breaking it are rewarded? Should I bring my sons to Canada or Mexico and drive them illegally into Kentucky? Why are U.S. families who desire to adopt orphans forced into a two-year process? Why are qualified, skilled Asian workers forced into a six-year process which still does not allow them to enter the U.S.?

Our first stop was a bit of lunch. We stopped at a sushi restaurant right next to the Seattle Art Museum and after lunch we went to the art museum. We mainly went to see the Gauguin show that is closing soon. It was packed. I typically stay away from these mega art shows since it so difficult to actually see the art and everyone walks around like zombies with those little phone tour gadgets. The show was interesting regardless of the crowd. Gauguin seemed to be such an inconsistent artist. Some of his paintings are full of such lovely detail while others just really floundered. Actually, most of them floundered. That being said, the handful of paintings which I enjoyed were absolute perfection
Far Guy got a new lumberjack shirt. His volunteer uniform consists of jeans, a red and black checked flannel shirt, a hat to match, suspenders and red socks peeking above his boots. Others participating in the program will be dressed in costumes. They asked me who I was coming as..I replied..plain old me. I wanted to sew a Prairie Dress over the winter..but it was just one of those things that never got done. Me and sewing with a machine is a real stretch of my imagination.

Three years ago I visited my first orphanage. It was an old catholic orphanage that is situated in a gorgeous village setting in eastern DRC. It is lovely. I was going to the orphanage to meet a little boy we were hoping to adopt to be our son. I spent that day holding this baby boy, while my hand was being held by another little boy at the same time. This little boy was named Patric. He was 5 years old at the time. He had come up early on and just stood by me. Quietly talking, singing along with the other kids. I knew he had a medical problem, I also knew there was something very special about him. Patric's head was bigger than what it should be; I thought he had hydrocephalus.
A read a very thought provoking blog this week by Michael Hait at Planting the Seeds, titled "The Genealogy Paradigm Shift: Are bloggers the new "experts"?" Michael discusses how geneabloggers are becoming viewed as something akin to experts in the field of genealogy. He also points out the lagging membership of genealogy societies, the importance of an online presence and support of these local societies. There were a lot of very interesting points made in the article, it's insightful, and I think it is a great read.
And comforts my tears.

I can't believe how fast time is flying by. We are getting ready to go to Hawaii on Feb 25th. We got this great opportunity to go with Chris' brother Brent and his wife to the Big Island for 7 nights. I am so excited to get back to the Islands- it's been 7 years since I've been back. Chris has never been. We will be staying over for two extra days on Oahu so I can show Chris around the BYU-Hawaii campus, Polynesian Culture Center and the North Shore. I can't wait, but it's bittersweet cause this will be our first time leaving our kids. I am happy that we will get a little break from everything and I know they will be in good hands with our moms and Maria, but I am hoping I don't worry about them too much. I want to be able to relax and enjoy myself but I also want them to be happy and not miss me too much.
We did the papers on Thursday and let them dry overnight. On Friday, i modeled how to cut different papers into shapes to create a collage picture like Carle does. Most students were quite successful with this, and they were very interested in becoming "real" illustrators.
I have been searching for a relevant association between, my proposed oral health thesis, and the impact of molecular biology. The main focus of my research study, is to discover determinant associations and identify correlations, between underserved populations with high prevalence and magnitude of oral disease, and determinant socio-demographic factors, such as, cultural norms and lifestyle risk factors, in relation to collected cariogenic oral bacteria, ultimately leading to periodontal and systemic diseases.

The Nuclear Age began in July 1945 when the US tested their first nuclear bomb near Alamogordo, New Mexico. A few years later, in 1953, President Eisenhower launched his “Atoms for Peace” Programme at the UN amid a wave of unbridled atomic optimism.
Before the English were a force in the new world, the Spanish crown had from the first granted monopolies to their invading Conquistadors in the Americas. The laws forcibly imposed by them, including monopoly grants, were specifically designed to extract all the wealth of the conquered people and the country and to give it to the Spanish overlords. No others could own property, and the products of their labors went mostly to allow the ruling class to live in luxury.

The number of road casualties amounted to 208,648 in 2010. Are we going to start blaming pregnant mothers involved in car accidents and promote publically how selfish they are for driving and not walking? I would hope not. I would hope this blame game stops and our culture of compassion returns.
The one thing that disappointed me later in the process was the lack of return calls, e-mails or texts. Maybe they fought I would be mad at them or something, but I'm not. Just let me know. It's business. Nothing personal. At least I hope not.

As an atheist, I'll be the first one to admit that I don't always understand why people do things. I don't get praying or speaking in tongues, I don't really understand the fatalistic acceptance of "god's will" or the unfounded assumption that everything that goes on in the world is really for the best at some abstract level. I am, in a word, accustomed, to being confused by the people around me on a fairly regular basis and, for the most part, I'm able to live with it. And yet, even with my general ability to handle things that don't make sense to me, this one stands out as particularly bizarre:

Hubby unhooked our cable boxes and returned them today. We will save $20 this month and starting next month, we will save $60/month. So our set up cost will be recouped in the 2nd month and we will be saving $$$$!!
At least I was comfortable on the train. Take it from someone who has done his fair share of cross-country traveling: riding by train can be so relaxing. With a bus, you've got people packed in close together, in seats that sometimes have fixed armrests, with people yacking on their cellphones or scolding screaming babies, and if you're big like me there's never enough legroom, and getting enough sleep is always a tenuous proposition at best. I could do an entire post on this.
We did the photos at home this morning, lots of takes and silly dance!. Underneath the cute shirt, they were on diapers only haha.

Deb requested, "I'd love to see your stylistic tribute to a favorite actress or fashion icon or designer. And let us guess who it is!"
Cupcakes: Carrot and double-chocolate. The carrot was great! Light, not-too-sweet, and had a vague flavour of almonds, which I enjoyed tremendously. The chocolate was good - very good at first bite, but there was an odd after-taste that lingered, and I found myself not wanting to finish the whole thing.

And there it is. He is absolutely right. When I think about it, it's pretty amazing that in this life, we have the freedom and opportunity to hit the Reset button whenever and wherever we choose. The only person holding me back from where I want to be, is me. Self-awareness and the ability to admit this to ourselves is the first step in making positive changes in our lives that will inevitably bring us desired results.
No sooner did Pat speak of the so called godly one when he finally joined in on the fun. I guess Petsy's hippo moved rather slow and he was so mad his eyes started to glow. Irish Air still rain around trying to put out her fire hair. She stopped, dropped and rolled, as Drazin joined the fold. The hippo was scared of her fire and acted like he popped a tire. Drazin flew through the air and gave his usual third person blare. He landed on Petsy's hippo rear and bounced off causing Blabber fear. He headed right for her until her tarsier stuck up his fur and push Blabber to the ground. Drazin landed on Glory Dear and the food in Miss Priss and I's yap was no longer found. Drazin got to his feet giving The Blue Guy his typical meet and greet.
Owen: My dad was a police officer too and was killed when I was a young boy. I don't know why but ever since then I was determined to be a cop too. My Mom wasn't too crazy about the idea but I felt like I needed to protect other kids from losing their dads like I did. I don't regret the decision - I love my job!
While everyone else is out chasing pumpkins and apples, I have been quietly collecting vegetables of the seasons gone by, the local leftover lima beans, corn, and zucchini, the former two, critical to the largely ignored autumnal toss of boiled corn and beans known as succotash. Most references to succotash hail from the Warner Brother's very dimwitted, yet endearing, sputtering cat, Slyvester, but its true and honest provenance is the American Indian Narragansett word for boiled corn, msíckquatash.
Hopefully soon, I'll be launching my long overdue 'for sale' section on my website. I hope to have prints (signed and unsigned), posters, mugs, shirts, and original illustrations to browse.
Anyhow, you always wonder when you homeschool if your kids will later regret the choices you made for them. It was nice to hear that Alexander is happy with where he is in life.
Michelle, thank you for your patience with me. Your card is going out in tomorrow’s mail. I am so sorry for the delay. It is not intentional but I’m sorry I let it get pushed down my list of “to-do’s”. I also have two items to mail out to two other bloggers (you know who you are) and they are going out tomorrow as well. I didn’t want your addresses for stalking purposes! Really!! :-)

For those who don’t know, Glee is “an American musical comedy-drama television series.

Kara and Lizzie are heiresses to one of the largest fortunes in the country. But when their father dies suddenly, the toddlers are ripped from the arms of Amanda, their loving stepmother, and given to their maternal grandparents, who only want the children’s fortune for themselves.
“I’ll take him,” Ayshe volunteered. She got her coat on, and riding on the orphanage ambulance, she held little Gursel who was wrapped up in a blanket. They drove into the city center to the well-known hospital which is supposed to care for wards of the state without charge.
Now, in Florida, just today mind you, I have seen BOTH Panther AND Bear crossing signs. Gator I’ve seen before, but Panther and Bear..? What kind of state is this that Panther and Bear are so plentiful and so normal that they have their own crossing signs? Granted, I saw neither of them today either, but really, do you WANT to see a Bear while driving a state highway? I’m pretty sure not! If a Panther jumps in front of me, he’d better hope there are lots more where he came from cause I ain’t slowing down! Mr Bear can just have my rig I’ll teach him to drive it and I’ll just walk, thank you!
Raleigh-based Salix Pharmaceuticals said Monday that the FDA has extended its review period for a drug that Salix wants to market as a diarrhea relief medication for HIV and AIDS patients.
'Birthday' introduced the world to That Björk Emotion – heart-bursting euphoria, a serotonin supernova of exultation, the sensation she once described (talking about early jungle) as "fierce fierce fierce joy...sort of 'I'm just too happy, I want to explode'." You can trace this oceanic rush of pantheistic awe running through her work, from Debut's 'One Day' and 'Violently Happy' to Homogenic's 'Alarm Call'. In the case of 'Birthday', the feeling came partly from the energy of the Medusa/post-Kukl milieu and partly from the birth of her son, Sindri. "It was written about a month after that. Just the most fantastic thing that ever happened to me...And kids in the street thought it was my little brother, kept asking me when my mum was coming home. It was summer and completely magical, this cocoon of... just love. Excellent!"

Life is not perfect and cannot be made so. Certainly a small number of children are hurt each year. But by trying to eliminate risk from children’s lives, overzealous parents are stunting their development, and inhibiting the ability of the vast majority to respond to challenges.

So, it's official. I've moved. I've been saying this day would come and it is finally here. My blog as you have seen it over the past year or so hasn't changed all that much…it's just that you'll find it at a different address with a different name.
What else should every bridesmaid do? What unusual duties have you had to take on? Leave it in comments!
Yes, I'm full of hope and worried that it'll come back and bite me. The other times I really hoped I was wrong, this time I am desperately hoping I am right.

By far the strangest beauty treatment I’ve ever had however, I do believe I will do it again. You’re killing two birds with one stone really. Your feeding the fish and rejuvenating the feet. I give the Fish spa an 8/10 for it’s uniqueness, hilarity and effectiveness in foot cleansing.
Anyway, I know that I was placed at the right place at the right time. This transformation of the dragonfly is something which I was meant to see. It was much like my life at the moment. It was hard and full of chaos, but when I finally emerge, people won't see me as the same person that I was before. I'll trade my old ways for new ways (water for wind). The new roads ahead of me will be will sometimes be dangerous (as were the old ones), and I'll find new foe, but I'll be safe(er) from the old ones, but they'll be amazing and exciting nonetheless.
Returning to the similarly driven style of the opening songs Ajuna offers a great persistent mix of thoughtful guitar and heavy resonance that continues the great quality offered by the album. It is with the closing three parts under the title of Hallucigenia that the album finds the deepest connection especially the third track. The first two parts Hermetic Gifts and Spiritual Junk open up the senses with sounds and intensity which coaxes the thoughts and emotions into welcoming the slightly draining drone and sure unrelenting meditative wave. As part two enters the drama and intrusion works deeper, but as with its predecessor they are the gateways to the stunning The Emerald Tab. The guitar drone like a bagpipe with a singular note, winds around every aspect of the senses. It verges on painful, leaves one with ringing ears, and takes the emotions through uncertain but decisive feelings, but it is deeply hypnotic. It is a harsh meditation but a cleansing laced with sonic light and reserved melodic additives. It is not a track that will work for all one suspects but as with the album it offers remarkable rewards.
You KNOW that you have to start again. Well ... you don't have to, of course. You can choose to just barrel on.
Take care everyone, and have a great day off if you're one of the lucky ones :) (I still have through Tuesday off... extending this one freebie day off to a five day weekend thankyouverymuch!)
My peep, Kristen Callihan tweeted a link to this article by Chuck Wendig today. View the full article, HERE. In it, he discusses the idea that rather than focusing on the sales/money that can and is being made in self-publication, we, as storytellers need to focus more on telling good stories. That's why we're all in this business to begin with, right?

The Psalmist explains how even after going to a religious event—a celebration of joyful praise with many people—he is still ‘cast down’ with a depression that is actually loneliness for even more of God. The writer is clearly not thirsty for more religion—he craves more relationship with God.

Monday in Belgrade was the opening of "Nowhere People"- an exhibit of photographs by Greg Constantine whose beautiful and haunting photos of stateless persons have been featured on the blog before. The opening was hosted by the Speaker of the House, Ms. Dejanovic, and by UNHCR who both congratulated Serbia on taking major steps to reduce statelessness by signing the 1961 Convention as well as pledging to help the legally invisible with the law on non-contentious procedure (that would allow legally invisible persons to be registered.)
You may have read that several scuba diving excursions were at sea the day the Indonesian tsunami struck. They were thrown into a tizzy of whirlpools and cross currents but everyone survived. When they arrived back in port they were in absolute shock at what had passed over them and the devastating consequences.
Fraser then quotes from an Atos Origin Medical Services meeting in 2004 which sets out just how the dogma that underpins the “biopsychosocial model” is being authoritatively promulgated, and he notes “the convenient fictions and lack of logic those responsible would…refuse to tolerate if applied to their own family and friends”.

What struck us first of all is that Wakefield is full of independent coffee shops and tea rooms. Which rather surprised us since a basic google search showed us hardly any of these. A lesson to us that you need to be in a town to know where to get a good cuppa; and perhaps a lesson to our favourite venues that they may need to improve their web presence if they are to attract more out-of-town visitors!
Structural imaging consistently reveals that compared with nonalcoholics, most alcoholics’ brains are smaller and less dense (11,12). Loss of brain volume is most noticeable in two areas: the outer layer (i.e., the cortex) of the frontal lobe, which is considered a major center of higher mental functions (7,12,13); and the cerebellum, which is responsible largely for gait and balance as well as certain aspects of learning (14). Support for these results is provided by functional imaging studies, which reveal altered brain activity throughout the cortex and cerebellum of heavy drinkers (15). In addition, functional imaging often is sufficiently sensitive to detect these irregularities before they can be observed by structural imaging techniques, and even before major cognitive problems themselves become manifest. This suggests that functional imaging may be particularly useful for detecting the early stages of cognitive decline (15).

Summary: All of the peoples of the earth lived in the same place and spoke the same language. The decided, using the technology of brick, to build a city, and a tall tower, “otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.” God came down from heaven to see what was going on with the city. When he saw their efforts to build a tower, he decides to confuse their language and scatter them over the face of the earth, because “If as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them.” This chapter then lists the genealogy from Shem to Abram, as well as some of the specifics of Abram’s immediate family.

Chabrol makes this discomfort felt especially in a strange evening where tensions arise over Michel's jigsaw puzzle, which is missing a piece. The boy's constant complaining about the puzzle irritates his parents, and they all begin sniping at each other, letting all their long-suppressed feelings come to the surface. In one telling moment, the boy accuses his father of hiding the puzzle piece, which is a nonsensical accusation that points to something else entirely: Charles has not hidden the puzzle piece, but he has hidden something else, a body, and in doing so he's also undone the secret foundation that this happy home had been built upon. The missing puzzle piece is both a corpse and the family's very happiness.
As it almost always does it is going to come down to Ohio, Pennsylvania (you remember the state that voted out Santorum by 18 points…they just love him), Missouri and Iowa. And I wouldn’t be surprised to see Romney’s VP come from one of these states. (While I’m not the biggest fan, looking at this, Governor John Kasich of Ohio is looking like he may have the tactical advantage for the number 2 spot).

In my first post I began to talk about the spiritual side of stress. It’s such an unusual approach that it might be good to review stress more conventionally first. Stress is made complicated because both mind and body are involved. The so-called stress response is a temporary event with physical markers, such as a rise in certain hormones.

Before I shut the door, I see: my four walls. Two pillows, one blanket. One wardrobe. The sink with a chip on the right side the only thing to mark my room as any different from the endless row of boxy rooms on this floor and others. The first things I remember.
Firstly, forgive me for my recent absence. When you work in the industry that I do, the whole month of December does not belong to you. Absolutely no personal life what so ever.

Mike McMackin had gone to Oberlin, he'd recorded a Pay The Man session that ended up not getting released. I think Steve Immerwahr, who went on to form Codeine, had some connection with him. Initially we were supposed to record Umber in January 1989 with Albini, but Orestes had a death in the family and we had to cancel at the last minute. Albini ended up giving that studio time to Slint, and that's when they recorded the session that became the 10" on Touch and Go. So, I'm happy to have contributed to some significant rock history, as well as playing in this band.
Just an aside, why on earth do some parents put their children on ‘The Worlds Strictest Parents’ programme. From what I have seen it is the parents that need to be educated not their children!!!

Another priority that I’m grappling with: working for myself. Over this last year it has truly become clear to me that the only way to really be successful is working for myself. For me, it’s not necessarily about fiscal success, but more about having a flexible schedule and being in control of the way a business is handled. When I moved to Oregon and moved in with my parents I decided to make this a priority and take advantage of my free rent. I did find a little success, but mostly because my old employers decided they still needed my help so they hired me as a freelancer. I thought this was great and I wanted to pursue finding more clients but I guess I’ve just been wrapped up in this whole “full-time job” thing and also paying rent.

As I have thought about this situation in my life and reflected on Scripture, I’ve become deeply persuaded that the question we ought to ask ourselves is not, “Am I trying to justify myself?” Rather we should ask, “How am I trying to justify myself?” It’s a given. Whether it’s how many sermons we preach, how many books we read or blogs we write, how much Scripture we memorize, how hip our clothes are, how good we are at football, how much trash we recycle, or how much money we make, we will seek justification for ourselves and before God in something. May this be our new confession:

I actually didn’t tell them for a long time, since I wanted to actually have something to show for what I was doing. And I was nervous about showing them things that might be darker or weirder than what they’d expect from me. But they’ve been really supportive. They may not always get everything I write but they’re all for it and that makes me very happy.
First of all, Thanks to Nuffnang for the movie screening. This movie is actually not bad, because I understand the whole story line in this movie. At beginning of this movie, you might think that this movie is Art Films or Horror Movie which is speechless all the time. They are putting alot of blur image about the past of Nick Cheung of this movie, why is he imprisoned and what is the motive of his sin and deed that send him into prison. And Simon Yam is the only Inspector who really put his full time effort to find the truth in all kind of cases happening in Hong Kong, some heavy cases. I would like to state here that: there will be some spoiler inside this movie, I hope you all prepare to listen about it.

In this book Lonely Planet are offering you the chance to bring street food into the kitchen. On one level this is absurd; it’s not street food if you cook it at home. It’s about as far from authentic as you can get. Otherwise though, it’s a brilliant idea; I still fantasise about Vietnamese Pho ten years on from travelling, and now I can cook my own. This is an evocative and mouthwatering cookbook. It even serves as as travel book. There are many dishes in here that make me want to visit countries I have never thought about going to, such as the Chivito al Pan from Uruguay.

Think about it. When was the last time you ever heard of someone being killed by a letter? Nobody would even suspect it. There'd be no evidence. And it's so insanely ridiculous that even if they found out about it, no court would ever convict!

I love that elegant European homes often mix very modern and very old objects, as our does ours; a Tizio lamp and 18th century engravings of a South Seas voyage, to name two. For inspiration, check out Elle Decoration, Marie-Claire Maison, every version of Cote Sud/Ouest. etc.; my absolute favorite is British magazine, The World of Interiors.

My only cons for this book were a very few grammar and spelling errors, and the fact that some of the paragraphs could be very long, and sometimes felt a bit too detailed -- fantasy fans will probably love the high use of description, however, and non-fantasy fans will love the creative story, and won’t mind the heavy description.

I’m not suggesting that looting is the way to go, because stealing things is wrong. But surely enough people now can see that boycotting the bottom line has a pretty immediate effect? Even if it doesn’t put some gargoyles out of business, it makes them squeal for help from the politicians. This is what we need.

According to De Lima, allowing Arroyo to travel abroad “puts her (GMA) beyond the jurisdiction of the State in the exercise of its … mandate to investigate and prosecute criminal acts.” Earlier in her resolution, she pointed out that “given the gravity of the charges” against the former president, “the temptation to simply escape criminal liability is definitely more real than apparent.” And in an apparent attempt to defend herself from future accusations of engaging in “mere speculations,” De Lima pointed out that flight from justice is one of the remaining hard choices left for Arroyo – especially since she is facing the probability of being detained “throughout the period of her trial for non-bailable offenses.”

But the Fire has some big things going for it. First, the $199 price, though the Fire’s seven-inch screen is less than half the surface area of the iPad’s display. Second, the Amazon and Kindle brands, already known and loved for e-readers and more. Third, Amazon is the only major tablet maker other than Apple with a large, famous, easy-to-use content ecosystem that sells music, video, books and periodicals. The Fire can be thought of as a hardware front end to all that cloud content.

The premise that a book can address every issue in politics according to the Bible is rather bold. It comes along with a wave of thought that everything Christians involve themselves in somehow needs to be related to biblical principles. Grudem points out in his introduction that much of what he has to say cannot be supported biblically. “I am certainly not claiming that the Bible also supports all the facts I cite about the world today.” With this admission, Grudem explains three standards he used in forming his premises: Biblical certainty, broader principles, and an appeal to facts. In reality, what he does is substitute broader principles for his presuppositions and an appeal to facts as philosophical arguments. If it were a cake recipe, the philosophical notions would be the flour, his presuppositions would be the sugar, and the biblical principles would be the baking powder. Hardly the comprehensive book it is selling itself to be. Certainly this can’t be avoided, and I wouldn’t even attempt to write a book on politics suggesting that everything had Scriptural support, but the issue I take with this claim is Grudem’s response that he is not going to distinguish between these three. Instead, he leaves that up to the reader to determine if he is right. But what, then, is the purpose of a comprehensive work claiming biblical affirmation? This allows Grudem to present his views to a Christian audience without the strenuous effort of explaining his premises. He can make an emotionally charged case without Scriptural support and rest assured that he had warned his readers he would do so.

I probably never forget the moment I saw three little sets of wide eyes standing at our front door. All of them so cute but knowing they had been through so much already. The oldest was a 5 year old girl, very bright eyed and keen to meet everyone. (For privacy reasons I’ll call her Cate*). The next was a 3 year old boy (Ben*) who also seemed keen to come inside. The last was a little 2 year old (Emma*) who had a look of fear and confusion. At first glance you could see Emma was unwell with big black circles under her eyes and the makings of a very heavy cold. It turns out that Emma was a premi baby, born at 26 weeks so is small for her age.

And socialist parties such as the British Labour Party were patriotic parties in World War II as well. And in World War II even Stalin moved in that direction. If Hitler learnt from Mussolini the persuasive power of nationalism, Stalin was not long in learning the same lesson from Hitler. When the Wehrmacht invaded Russia, the Soviet defences did, as Hitler expected, collapse like a house of cards. The size of Russia did, however, give Stalin time to think and what he came up with was basically to emulate Hitler and Mussolini. Stalin reopened the churches, revived the old ranks and orders of the Russian Imperial army to make the Red Army simply the Russian Army and stressed patriotic appeals in his internal propaganda. He portrayed his war against Hitler not as a second "Red" war but as 'Vtoraya Otechestvennaya Vojna' -- The Second Patriotic War -- the first such war being the Tsarist defence against Napoleon. He deliberately put himself in the shoes of Russia's Tsars.

With just under a day left for negotiations before the government will shutdown and despite working non-stop this week Congressional Republicans and Democrats have still not come to an agreement for the 2011 Budget. Wednesday and Thursday President Obama kept meeting with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) at the White House, declaring some progress, still no agreement has been made. Although Obama opposes and threatened to veto the measure Speaker Boehner and Republicans are working on a week extension to prevent the shutdown on midnight Saturday. At issue is the 7 million difference between the Democrats proposed 33 million and the Republicans 40 million in spending cuts. The shutdown would affect 800,000 federal workers out of 2 million workers, and will also affect all aspects of the government at a time when the fragile economy is just starting to recover.

I have three blogs: Kweschn, Destination X, and Kemetsahift Alem (Books World). Kweschn is where I post my original works, poems and short stories mostly. Destination X is where I re–post what I discover online. Kemetsahift Alem is where I share quotes or excerpts taken from Ethiopian literary books, written in Amharic (Ethiopia’s official language), Afaan Oromo (second widely spoken language), and Tigrigna (third major language, which is also the official language in Eritrea).
I opted not to upgrade for more design options or go the WordPress Pro route, as I do not plan on using WordPress after the conclusion of this class. I am a Blogger Girl at heart! I maintain a Blogspot blog in which I chronicle my crazy life (college, internships, theater, nonprofit). The posting process for Blogspot is infinitely easier and faster than WordPress, in my modest opinion. The main advantage, though, is that Blogspot’s dashboard is clean and without the clutter that comes along with WordPress. Granted, that clutter comes with a variety of options, but I enjoy the speedier publishing process of Blogspot.

Eventually things calmed down, and people were asked to re-settle, to go back to the village. Some people did return, but majority of them left the area altogether. My family decided to stay in the small town, though financially we had a hard time; we literally had almost nothing as most of what my parents owned was left behind. At least we were alive because some people had perished in the cover of darkness.

A few years ago I started thinking about what it might be like to live in a universe that was different from our own in one very simple but profound way: instead of having a fourth dimension, time, that was set apart from the three dimensions of space, you had four dimensions that were completely interchangeable. In this universe, at the deepest level, "the future" and "the past" would be directions no different from "north" and "south" — and just as those compass points take their meaning from a particular object, the Earth, whose axis could as easily be pointing any way at all in space, in this hypothetical universe "the future" and "the past" would always be the future and past of a particular physical object, such as a cluster of stars and planets, rather than a property of the universe itself.
Shaun had told the audience prior that they had a new album coming out and that hopefully they would have it done in the next “two or so months though it might end up being released in January”. he also said that sometimes they get tired of playing the old songs so they thought they’d play us a new one. he said that he might end up fucking it up but then again if he did nobody would know because nobody else had prior heard it. still not sure if this was their first time playing it but the way he introduced it made it sound like that this was its debut. sorry the sound quality isnt the best but it can still be heard with simple volume adjusments.

The easiest argument is the one that is often used in this case. Perry’s films make money, while Spike’s not as much. Let’s be clear. No one including Spike, can knock Tyler Perry’s hustle. No one does that better. But do you think that Lil’ Wayne is a better emcee than Nas or KRS-One because he sells more downloads? Do you believe that a Big Mac is better than a Ruth Chris sirloin because they sell more volume? The fact is that it is undeniable that Perry is a better business man then Spike, but not a better teacher. Ultimately, when it’s all said and done, if I had to choose what to put in the time capsule for generations of the future to use as a case study of what our generations film making legacy would be, I’ve got to go with the little dude from Brooklyn. I guess that’s the professorial, Obama trait in me, overtaking the hustler, Diddy trait in me. I just think our future would be better off.

Well, silly me, I didn’t realize blacks were there all the time. My problem was not counting them the way Harvard people do. Consider Harvard Law Professor and senatorial candidate Elizabeth Warren, listing herself as a minority (native American variety) because she is 1/32nd Cherokee thanks to her great great great grandmother who was (perhaps). The Law School celebrated her appointment in ’95 as one of the few women in the Law School, and then a year or so later celebrated her native American heritage. ““Of 71 current Law School professors and assistant professors, 11 are women, five are black, one is Native American and one is Hispanic,” The Harvard Crimson quotes then-Law School spokesman Mike Chmura as saying in a 1996 article.
but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God--through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God's law, but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.”
Found this puppy for $10.00 at the DI. I usually wouldn't have paid that much, but it was vintage, and in GREAT condition! I actually used crafting Toll Paint this time.

OK so with the CDs there is a little trick you can do that makes it a little easier and most of the time it works. After taking the outer plastic off they usually just have one of those silly plastic stickers on the top of the CD case. The thing to do is carefully "pop" the hinge on the bottom of the CD case that way you can open the thing from the bottom to the top using the sticker as the hinge (the case has the hinge on the left side so you normally open it from the right to the left.) Once you have it opened up you can separate the two halfs fairly easily and then take the sticker off the remaining side.
The interpretative path followed by the ECJ falls in line with the objectives set by these directives, which aim at ensuring the maintenance and development of creativity in the interest of authors (recital 9 in the preamble of Directive 2001/29), recognizing IP as an integral part of property, promoting the European cultural creativity, and safeguarding the independence and dignity of artistic creators and performers (recital 11). Accordingly, the ownership of copyright and related rights necessarily vests in the authors themselves, as exploitation rights merely represent one aspect of the property right protected by Article 17 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Among the provisions that expressly link ownership to authorship, the court mentions Article 2 of Directive 93/83, Article 2 of Directive 2001/29, and Article 3 of Directive 2006/115.
Now that Mike Nifong has admitted he has no physical or forensic evidence linking any of the players he has targeted to any crime, he has made clear he is relying solely on the identifications made by the accuser in the April 4 lineup. He doesn’t, however, profess to believe anything that the accuser actually said about the three players ultimately indicted, since her remarks about them on April 4—each in a different way—are wholly inconsistent with the evidence in the case.

It was my big secret, except for the person who gave me a ride to the clinic. What would people think of me? Ugly adjectives and harsh judgments would dodge my steps. What if they asked about the father? How could I deliver a child? Would they be white or a mix of races? Who would even want to be around me? I didn’t even want to be around me. Also, I had finally just met a nice guy. He was trying to go about dating me the proper way. Would this mess it all up?! He’d drop me like a bad habit! My selfish reasons make me sick to my stomach now. I remember the people who tried to stop me as I went in and something inside me wanted to listen. Inside the clinic, I was handled coldly and abruptly. It still stings today. Of course, I felt that I deserved it all! Etched into my mind is the shock of having the doctor make a derogatory remark to me just before the procedure!
Some time in the next week or so, I will post damage photos. I had a chance to survey and shoot damage inside a destroyed home in Aurora, Nebraska (and offered the shots to the Lincoln newspaper.)

Usually, Sci-Fi books are not illustrated, although one can easily claim that many graphic novels are indeed Sci-Fi in nature. Alas, I can’t help but be attracted by drawn images, and I decided early on that Genesis would be illustrated. I believe drawings work with prose to better share what an author envisions than either mode of communication can do alone. My doctoral work at Penn State examined this area, with numerous studies indicating that simultaneously enlisting semantic and visuospatial resources greatly enhances attention acquisition and memory formation.

Like a lot of other bands, they straddle the line between pagan metal and black metal (if it's really a line at all), using very few folk elements. They play at a mid-pace for black metal, allowing their very catchy riffs to sink in (see especially "Waldeinsamkeit"), while the drums never go into blast-beat territory, instead opting for a fast but steady pace with some fills. Most of the vocals are rasped, but there are some more melodic vocal styles in here as well. Which brings me to some of the surprises.

For non-Spaniards, the constitution of a Gibraltar based company or other offshore operation in order to own property in Spain has been another way to avoid Spanish inheritance taxes. When the founder of the company dies, he leaves his shares in the company to whomever he chooses, in a will made outside Spain. As far as the Spanish authorities are concerned, the same company continues to own the property and no transfer has taken place, hence there is no tax or any other costs to pay.

When you ask insurance professionals about predictions, of course you don’t expect wild fantasies such as jet-powered agents and X-Ray objection detectors. Also, don’t expect doomsday prophesies such as Mayan predictions for the “end of time” (that’s on Dec. 21, 2012, by the way).
I believe this is a photograph of a beautiful street in Germany. I’ve never been. I don’t know what I will feel if I ever get there. Maybe one day I will land in Germany and think, yes, this is where I was meant to be!

Dickie walked the short distance to where a creek runs close to the tracks. He spotted a clearing in the weeds and walked to the grave. On the grave was Herkimor. Dickie edged closer. Herkimor did not move. Dickie called his name. Herkimor did not move. Dickie nudged him. Herkimor was stiff. He was dead.
Socio Rehab also host many events including cocktail nights, masterclasses and even the chance to jump behind the bar and have a go yourself! Friendly bartenders who know what they’re talking about – but use simple terms that can mean non-bartender folk can order without feeling out-of-place, an inviting setting, and some great drinks to try, Socio Rehab still hits the nail on the head when it comes to a city centre cocktail bar.
Did you know that a large-scale project is underway to build another clock that will be able to run with minimal maintenance and interruption for ten millennia? It’s called The 10,000 Year Clock and its construction is sponsored by The Long Now Foundation. The 10,000 Year Clock is, however, being built for more than just its precision and durability. If the creators’ intentions are realized, then the clock will serve as a symbol to encourage long-term thinking about the needs and claims of future generations. Of course, if all goes to plan, our future descendants will be left to maintain it too. The interesting question is: will they want to?
10. LaShawn Merritt 4x4 Anchor in Daegu – Nothing beats the excitement of relay running, and the most exciting relays are those that find someone coming from behind for the win. It’s been a long time since I’ve watched one of these in a Major – 1991 to be exact. This time however, we were on the winning end, and that made it doubly sweet!

I got what I needed -- a (bootleg, I think, since it was being sold by some people also selling t-shirts for a sauna company) button I can attach to myself discreetly in Ameriskeptic contexts (read: France) -- and we left right after the speech, while the video screen still showed him shaking hands with the crowd. As we headed up 17 Juni, the loneliest man in Berlin stood, a 60-something-year-old guy holding an umbrella, from which little McCain signs depended. Germans were mocking him loudly, and I almost felt sorry for him except for the fact that he was, in fact, advocating a continuation of the horror the US has lived through for the past eight years.
I keep telling myself that if he is at least finished with this step then we are one step closer to the next.

I tried the normal commands the shelter told me he knew, ones like “sit” and “stay” and “come” and “heel,” and he’d follow them – when he felt like it. He never really seemed to listen when I called his name – sure, he’d look in my direction after the fourth of fifth time I said it, but then he’d just go back to doing whatever. When I’d ask again, you could almost see him sigh and then grudgingly obey.

According to the Boston Globe, the residence has been at various times the Palm Hotel, a bordello, the Franciscan House of Studies, and a condo. Rumor has it that the top floor is haunted.
9. “Let all Thy works, O Lord, confess to Thee, and let Thy saints bless Thee” (ver. 10). How so? Is not the earth His work? Are not the trees His work? Cattle, beasts, fish, fowl, are not they His works? Plainly they too are. And how shall these too confess to Him? I see indeed in the angels that His works confess to Him, for the angels are His works: and men are His works; and when men confess to Him, His works confess to Him; but have trees and stones the voice of confession? Yes, verily; “let all” His “works confess to” Him. What sayest thou? even the earth and the trees? …But there ariseth the same question in regard of praise, as in regard of confession. For if earth and all things devoid of sensation therefore cannot confess, because they have no voice to confess with; neither will they be able to praise, because they have no voice to proclaim with. But do not those Three Children enumerate all things, as they walked amid the harmless flames, who had leisure not only not to fear, but even to praise God? They say to all things, heavenly and earthly, “Bless ye the Lord, praise Him and magnify Him for ever.” Behold how they praise. Let none think that the dumb stone or dumb animal hath reason wherewith to comprehend God. They who have thought this, have erred far from the truth. God hath ordered everything, and made everything: to some He hath given sense and understanding and immortality, as to the angels; to some He hath given sense and understanding with mortality, as to man; to some He hath given bodily sense, yet gave them not understanding, or immortality, as to cattle: to some He hath given neither sense, nor understanding, nor immortality, as to herbs, trees, stones: yet even these cannot be wanting in their kind, and by certain degrees He hath ordered His creation, from earth up to heaven, from visible to invisible, from mortal to immortal. This framework of creation, this most perfectly ordered beauty, ascending from lowest to highest, descending from highest to lowest, never broken, but tempered together of things unlike, all praiseth God. Wherefore then doth all praise God? Because when thou considerest it, and seest its beauty, thou in it praisest God. The beauty of the earth is a kind of voice of the dumb earth. …And this which thou hast found in it, is the very voice of its confession, that thou praise the Creator. When thou hast thought on the universal beauty of this world, doth not its very beauty as it were with one voice answer thee, “I made not myself, God made me”?

So where you might ask does the Slutty Samsung fit into all this. The Slutty Samsung (also known as miserable whore) is actually my latest phone. Those of you that follow have read before about my failed interactions with modern technology and its general dislike of me (which dates back to when I was in school …. do you know ANYONE else that gets banned from even walking into a school computer room???). Well my latest cell phone HATES ME!! She, the slut, has decided that she prefers my husband and does everything possible to end up in his hands where she then ceases all obstinate behaviour and acts perfectly. But I KNOW the truth and the truth has been witness by my friends when my husband is not around …. and the truth is my phone is a possessed, slutty piece of technology that should obviously belong to a man!!! Well Slutty Samsung the war is on!!! Discussions have commenced about possibly trying to depossess or bind the evil thing with magic … but for now I find just turning it off and ignoring it also work.

Exposures to Children – Rodenticides are an important tool for public health pest control, including controlling mice and rats around the home; however, the use of these products has been associated with accidental exposures to thousands of children each year. Fortunately, only a small number of exposed children experience medical symptoms or suffer adverse health effects as a result of their exposure.

How do people behave toward each other in societies that aren’t obsessed with image and narcissism? The ancient Inca commonly greeted each other by uttering the phrase, “Don’t lie, don’t cheat, don’t be lazy!” (Amu Llulla, Amu Quella and Amu Sua). The ancient Maya, though widely misunderstood (you’re picturing a crazy-eyed shaman clutching a beating heart, aren’t you?), greeted each other with the phrase In Lak’ech, which translates as “I am you and you are me”. Namaste, which anyone who’s attended a yoga class will have heard, simply means “I salute the divine in you”. The way we address each other, or fail to, has a lot of power. It’s not a bad idea to take some cues from our collective ancestors about how we can develop a more conscious, peaceful public life.
Now I don’t claim to be an expert on the entire life of Jesus, and none of the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John really give us any insight into him between his birth and age 27, but none of them mention him lying on his left side for 390 days and then on his right for another 40 in order to bear the sins of the people of Israel, especially after committing a genocide (Ezekiel 4:2).
As far as what I’ve learned from the process, there are so many lessons that have been learned post-Drift that I could write a series of articles on them. If I could only give three important lessons, it would be these…
Awesome As F**k is what a live album should be: fun, fresh and fantastic. As the title even alludes to its f**king awesome and the album immediately drops you into that concert environment. The last two times I saw Green Day was during the first leg of the 21st Century Breakdown tour with their final show at The Forum and during “New Years” at L.A. Live near the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. Both times, they sounded fantastic, but the “New Years” gig was even more amazing. At that show, they primarily played their old stuff from Kerplunk, Insomniac, 39/Smooth and a handful of “current songs” from American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown (maybe three or so during a 90 minute set). The raw energy they infused the audience with at each show created two great memories for this Green Day fan.

Weinman has tried the case twice. The first jury hung. The second deliberated “for several hours,” he said. Then, the jury sent out a note asking whether Lewis’ disability had to be the sole reason she was fired. The jury no-caused his client after getting the answer.
Bush gets the early pass in part because of the two year relentless, and structured GOP campaign of denigration, vilification, and assault on Obama’s policy initiatives and Obama personally. Its shock troops, the Tea Party horde, Glenn Beck, Limbaugh, Palin and the endless pack of shrill, hatchet job rightside bloggers, websites, and talk show hacks have effectively painted a picture of an Obama as an alien, anti-American, a closet Muslim terrorist sympathizer, a socialist, communist, and an inveterate America basher and hater.

Namaste! We are your Ascended Masters! We come today with more blessed news. The time approaches for our associates to begin the mass arrests. A preliminary stage is still underway, in which an additional amount of incriminating evidence is coming to light due to the ever-widening net cast by various international police agencies. Just as Heaven proclaimed, we are observing just how swiftly the dark’s all-encompassing web of control is unraveling. The number of personages involved in major malfeasance is truly staggering, and we watch the blessed hand of divine justice help our associates to gather an absolute mountain of evidence. On top of that, many persons arrested in the past month have provided clues and named names. There are dossiers on the entire upper echelon of the dark cabal and this will lead soon to their mass arrest. The insuperable power wielded over you by the dark for millennia is now summarily evaporating, and so your freedom rapidly approaches!
As she rested her right earlobe onto his, yes, supple chest, she could literally hear that his full-pulsating heartbeats were singing an aria for her soul. As she rubbed her peculiar eyes, she became even more figurative. She nonchalantly proclaimed, "We make such a good tandem, like muscles and cartilages - the two of us, we're like Siamese twins sans the common genes, we are soulmates." Her imaginations became animated. She was in elation.
Well, an obvious positive would be getting accepted by Echelon Press for publication. However, in my travels and networking I’ve met so many wonderful authors and editors and so the wonderful experiences continue with those developing relationships.
I've avoided looking at any courtroom footage of the Oslo murderer, just as I avoided seeing any footage of Fabrice Muamba keeling over on the White Hart Lane pitch. I don't need to see either. I don't need to be further inflamed or shocked or moved. I don't need television telling me what to feel. I know what I feel about both events and I can imagine what I would feel if I saw either.

“Everybody knows that unemployment is a growth industry at the moment, and if you’re going to get in on the ground floor – or in the gutter, where many of our finest graduates now find themselves – you’ve got to plan accordingly.”
Our efforts would not have succeeded this far without the genius of the boat’s skipper and his friends who have pitched in on the whole glorious affair. To counter-balance all of this practical brilliance and to stop us feeling too positive we are also dogged by a Greek chorus of shaggy old men who stop by, often for hours at a stretch, to shake their heads and tell us that what we’re doing is rubbish and it’ll never work.
Upon the other hand, while I believe that the emergency powers had ceased in June 1945, I am not prepared to hold that all executive orders issued thereafter under Commonwealth Act No. 671, are per se null and void. It must be borne in mind that these executive orders had been issued in good faith and with the best of intentions of three successive Presidents, and some of them may have already produced extensive effects in the life of the nation. We have, for instance, Executive Order No. 73, issued on November 12, 1945, appropriating the sum of P6,750,000 for public works; Executive Order No. 86, issued on January 7, 1946, amending a previous order regarding the organization of the Supreme Court; Executive Order No. 89, issued on January 1, 1946, reorganizing the Courts of First Instance; Executive Order No. 184, issued on November 19, 1948, controlling rice and palay to combat hunger; and other executive orders appropriating funds for other purposes. The consequences of a blanket nullification of these executive orders will be unquestionably serious and harmful. And I hold that before nullifying them, other important circumstances should be inquired into, as for instance, whether or not they have been ratified by the Congress expressly or impliedly, whether their purposes have already been accomplished entirely or partially, and in last instance, to what extent; acquiescence of litigants; de facto officers; acts and contrast of parties acting in good faith; etc. It is my opinion that each executive order must be viewed in the lights of its peculiar circumstances, and, if necessary and possible, before nullifying it, precautionary measures should be taken to avoid harm to public interest and innocent parties.

The core of "Agenda 2010" was a welfare reform that took a page from Bill Clinton's "workfare" legislation. Unemployment benefits were limited to 12 months. After that, the able-bodied would have to make do with a bare minimum. The basic idea was to get people off unemployment benefits by making them look for work.

Honorius was declared a heretic by a later Pope. In my reading, as the Church and heretics battled over the current heresy (I can’t remember which one it was) I noticed a very curious thing. The heretics were all making attempts to get the approval of the Bishop of Rome and no other Bishop. This indicated to me that they knew that if they could get the stamp of approval for their beliefs from this bishop,they would triumph over those where calling them heretics. It was even more convincing to me b/c I stumbled on it and was not even looking for historical evidence of Papal primacy.

There is enough paranoia-inducing material here to brew up a whole pot of hot conspiracy stew, yet the facts on the ground are sparse. Googling “mahareen” turns up nothing definitive; it appears as a foreign word in several places (including Ireland!), and does not seem to have any particular Muslim or Arab connotations. The MOA sign is gone — yet Dave knew that name without any prompting from me, so I’m certain that it was there at some point.

To get started, first sit comfortably at the patient’s head with the top of the head resting on a towel facing your chest and the body away from you. If that sort of a massage bed is not available then sit on the bed and pillow the patient’s head in your lap, placing an absorbent towel on your lap. Make sure you’re comfortable and your back rests against a headboard. Keep a jar or bottle of the stroke patient’s favourite moisturiser handy. Dab a little of the moisturiser on your fingers each time you start to massage a certain area of the face.
Now, I'm not saying that all retailers don't carry synthetic fabrics for all size ranges. Unfortunately clothing manufacturers want to make cheap clothing, and unfortunately most shoppers don't want to pay for quality fabrics. But those of us who know, know that synthetics (other than rayon) are supremely uncomfortable to wear. I got sick of it at one point, and bought two tops from B&Lu which were something like 60% cotton/40% polyester. And I tried to wear them, I did. But I wanted to crawl out of my skin after about 5 minutes. To Goodwill they went!

Keep in mind that beautiful photos alone will not sell a home. Your agent needs to have a comprehensive marketing plan that will focus on reaching out to the buyers. They need to know the community, have an in-depth knowledge of the local market & understand what it takes to sell a home in this market. In addition, a house needs to be competitively priced and in “showing ready” condition. Price, Appearance/Condition and Aggressive Marketing are critical in getting top dollar when selling your home.

On a late August morning in 2007, surfer Todd Endris put on his wetsuit and headed to Marina State Beach. It was the perfect day to go surfing. After having caught a few waves he was resting on his board, 75 yards off shore. All of a sudden he was hit from below and thrown 15 feet into the air, by a great white shark. The second time, the shark came down and clamped his torso in his mouth. The attack shredded his back, and peeled the skin off. Luckily for Endris, his stomach was pressed against the surfboard so his intestines and organs were protected. The third time, the shark grabbed a hold of his right thigh and bit it to the bone. Powerless to escape from the shark that came out of nowhere, Endris desperately needed a miracle to survive. But suddenly, an unlikely group of swimmers came to his rescue.

So needless to say, I had to get over Freddy before I could really start delving into the horror genre.

There’s no big hook as with a couple of the other FX series; there’s no bikie gang like with Sons or a brilliantly twisty pilot like with Damages, the draw here really is Timothy Olyphant. As you would expect from material based on Elmore Leonard the dialogue is stellar and there are few shows out there that can make two characters in a room talking to each be so damn compelling. Lines like: “Will you shoot me if you get the chance?” “You make me pull, I’ll put you down.” turn the dialogue into the other star of the show alongside Olyphant.
I was going to give myself today to just write stuff out of my head, without interruptions other than the necessary. I didn’t do that (no extra juicy content for you), but I do have two new therapists lined up to interview tomorrow. I hope to catch one who can combine career coach with life coach and therapist (who takes my insurance). It’s not much, I know, but a girl had to have expectations, no? The combination approach is intended to give me more accountability, which will in turn motivate me to actually work on my goals, so i have something worthwhile to report every week. So essentially I am buying myself some expensive positive feedback, but from what I do know about my inner workings, it will cause me to actually take action (as well as track progress, which will both gain me confidence by being able to see progress, and make me feel better about myself).
then you build on the plates,
Financially lets not go there or I will freak out, still a couple hundred short for the month with bills and other expenses, still unsure how we are going to handle this all. My car is still acting up, well I should say the sensor is, last week it went off like crazy, this week its went off once. Last week it rained all week this week it hasn't so I am thinking the rain and moisture causes that sensor to act up. Irregardless we have to replace it, just have to figure out if we are going to tackle it or have the shop do it. I would prefer us so we can save almost $100. All I can do at this point is have faith that everything will work itself out and turn around, and hopefully soon. I know we are never given more than we can handle but I feel like this is a bit too much at one time for a person to handle.
This is just the best worst story ever. Just reading the first couple paragraphs it was hard for me to read through it. There was a time in our child’s life when she was first born when we did not know if she was going to make it through…thankfully that time was brief and she is a beautiful healthy girl today. To think that your baby is not going to make it and you only have such a short precious time with them is soo unimaginable and for this one family that is exactly what is happening.

Her young guests arrived to mark the momentous occasion, and sat on a bar stool while our debuting gourmand got busy getting dinner on the table. In my mentor role, I suggested reading the directions on the taco seasoning packages and preparing the necessary additions while the meat was browning. Pretty basic, it was taco seasoning and 2/3 cup water per package. At the time I did not perceive this to be a stumbling block. It did present itself surprisingly as a perplexing problem to said nouveau chef. Math reared its ugly head and there was no one in the room to slay the beast except grandmum, and she was mum.

This would be the final card of Stormin' Norman's career. Norm had already seen a serious contraction of his playing time in '73 and in '74 he was unceremoniously dumped before the season ended. It was not a terribly fitting end to a guy's career in Detroit who'd entertained fans for a long time both on and off the field. His best moment of the '73 season may have been when he came to the plate as the final out of Nolan Ryan's no-hitter carrying a table leg. He had his huge '61 season, made a bunch of All-Star teams, was an offensive star in the '68 Series, and twice won Comeback Player of the Year (although I guess that last one could be viewed as a mixed blessing). Plus Norm was a friendly guy who played hard off the field as well, happy to suck some down with fans at local bars. That last trait would get him some trouble at the end. Here he reaches for an imaginary low throw during spring training showing off a mitt that looks as old as he is. Leaning on the batting cage behind him appears to be manager Billy Martin, no slouch in the partying life himself.

Marvell Rep is unique in that it upholds a theatrical system that is otherwise extinct in New York – rotating repertory. Marvell Rep stages multiple productions simultaneously in the same space, utilizing a set that is modified according to the production being performed and even sharing some actors. This system is still widely popular elsewhere in the world, notably in world famous Moscow Art Theater or the National Theater in London, yet, it seems to grow less popular in New York. Not surprisingly, since it presents unique challenges for directorial and creative staff who must create sets and costumes that are versatile, as well as actors who now have to work on multiple productions at the same time and keep track of which role they are performing and which lines need to be read.

Today, I sat in my car standing in non-moving traffic when the weather showed nothing but depression on my front window, I heard something that cheered me up: the first commercial 3D chocolate printer in on sale. Amazing, technology is not standing still, and apparently this is what it is leading to. Last year I already saw the news about “normal” 3D printer, but now there is also a specific chocolate version; for more information and movies go to this page.

I started writing thinking I was going to give some detailed description of my day at the mukhabarat in Amman (yeah, that happened) or my 6 hours and 5 separate interrogations on the border. But oddly enough, I don’t care so much anymore. I barely cared even on those days. I was more frustrated with some of the Palestinians crossing with me from Jordan than I was with the Israelis. I expect the Israelis’ nonsense and hostility, their suspicion and frustration at my existence, and have learned, even living thousands of miles away, how to push past it in absolute calm. What I have never learned or understood are the Palestinians who are so outraged so easily and so self-righteous about their foreign citizenships, who are so offended to be treated like a Palestinian at the border, instead of realizing the insanely exalted position of privilege they are returning in and to. It is not that any human being shouldn’t be outraged at the humiliation which they are forced to undergo, it is the attitude that for some reason, you are better than all of the other Palestinians who undergo it every day. It took more restraint to not yell at the Palestinian-Australians with me than it did at the Druze son of a bitch who kept trying to speak to me in Arabic to change my story.

And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal? Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man? I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.

Thank you for your patience while my apathy towards school turned into apathy on life. One reason I could tell it was apathy and not depression was that my bad attitude was focused on specific events (i.e. upcoming tests and the end of the semester) rather than anxiety over everything in life or general sadness at transition. I guess since I know that transition is coming and I can prioritize what needs to happen, I’m not feeling mowed over by life.

I rarely have time to take a breather during the week. I feel like I constantly have to be productive. By the time I check off everything on my to-do list, I have more to do. Finding consistency in my quiet times with God was difficult the first couple weeks of school. I tried to do it in the morning, but if I had a lot to do I would push it back later….and later…..and later…..until it was time to go to bed and I was exhausted. This past week I finally got myself on a schedule so that doesn’t happen. My days are significantly better when I read the Bible and pray in the morning. I need to go out into the world with Scripture running through my head, with my thoughts focused on God. It gives me a positive, fresh start each morning, and keeps me prayerfully minded through out the day.

Now that the election has passed and the Government shows no signs of crumbling apart quite yet, I feel that I can come clean and admit that I have voted Conservative all of my life. So my bias is clear. What I've discovered since joining the EDL is that this doesn't matter. All are truly welcome here. Through the EDL I've come to question some of the assumptions that I have may have made about certain groups of people, and perhaps tackle some of my prejudices. I've spoken to trade unionists, committed socialists, and all manner people from different political and social backgrounds; people, I'm sorry to admit, I've often held a dim view of in the past.

And if so, it speaks volumes as to the state of men today because this is the formation of the modern era. But the question is begged--is this necessarily true of men and thus an observation about intrinsic character and build, or does it become true because we have uttered it. Are there places and times in history where this ideal was not honored nor did it have meaning? Does it matter? Does the attitude persist today under other guise? (I think so) And is it, in general, helpful or harmful to society and to the advancement of humanity? So many questions from so short a passage. Well worth one's time for no telling what might be uncovered to pique one's interest and curiosity.

I didn’t think it was all that cool or convenient because its just another trash to clutter up my bathroom but Toby swears by it and says he wouldn’t be able to handle Oliver if we didn’t have the Litterlocker. That’s kind of silly if I think about it now because I’m pretty sure babies smell a whole lot worse sometimes and sometime in the future he’ll have to “handle” that. Anyways, I really just bought it because of my shopping addiction and I thought it would be nice to spoil Ollie. I never got to spoil my pets when I was living at home with my family but now that I have a kitty cat all to myself, oh what the hell, right? It actually is pretty useful, I didn’t notice it at first but it really cut down the smell, especially if you clean the litter box right after the cat uses it. I think it maximizes plastic bag space and instead of purchasing more refills or using grocery bags, we can just use our huge trash bags.

Our school is in the middle of a super fun fundraiser. Instead of spending too much money on stuff we don't want so the school can get a dollar off of ever ten (I don't know if that is the right math, but you know how I feel about this stuff,) we are doing a Flamingo Fundraiser. It's simple. You pay ten bucks to put flamingos in your friend's yard, and if the flock shows up in your yard, you pay ten dollars to send them somewhere else. If you don't want the flamingos to return you can buy "Flamingo Insurance." It is kind of the most fun idea I've heard of in a while. It's cute to see the flash of hot pink as we drive around the neighborhood, and the thought of various PTA members sneakily moving the birds around is hilarious to me.

While the world at large says things like, ‘good on you for following your dreams,’ it stomps on us as it turns its back on us. Following your dreams is good because it makes you happy to do what you most want to do. Following your dreams is admirable because it’s hard. Following your dreams is hard because most people don’t, and because most people put up with something else, that something else becomes the norm which then makes it hard to stray from the standard path.
I think fans of fantasy movies and fiction will find much to like about this film, assuming you can be patient with the goofier elements. Even if you can't, "Hercules and the Captive Women" features better battle scenes and a faster pace than most films of this kind--it is definitely one of the best "sword & sandal" films. Further, the 10-year-old boy who resides in all of us (even you women out there) will also get a kick out of the film, given it features lines like "This day is dedicated to Uranus" and "Uranus will rule the world!")

Opposite The Day After and Testament, there some ludicrous presentations. They include Invasion U.S.A. This Is Not A Test and Panic In Year Zero. Wildly inaccurate and poorly executed these films from the ’50s and ’60s couldn’t convey what would really happen if the unthinkable happened. Two more recent efforts include a “comedy” that aired on Fox called Whoops! about nuclear war survivors and Jericho which aired on CBS. So much of what happens in the show is unbelievable. Here are a couple of examples: townspeople put out an open-air picnic after a radioactive rainfall (!); a spoiled rich girl throws a party because her parents are out of town and won’t give up her generator to the police-who stand idly by as she parties! In reality, the authorities would’ve taken the generator by gunpoint.

It might not, however, have been as much fun for her as I imagined whilst I read. Given the structure of the story with its seamless flow from one passage to the next, the craft employed in engaging us with the characters and the action and the way she had me laughing, smiling and wincing through the book, there was probably a lot more sweat and a few more tears in the process than the end product suggests. Easy to read may not always mean easy to piece together.

There have been a number of negative reviews for Jessica Spotswood's Born Wicked. Some have said that the protagonist, Cate was self absorbed and they found her to be a little bit of a snob. There are others who thought that the tyrant government was a little unbelievable- that a small group of people with no magical capabilities would have so much authority did not ring true. Others found the novel refreshing, a great reprieve from the usual YA dystopians. I would have to agree with this later group. I really enjoyed Born Wicked and I wasn't sure that I was going to.

Now for the 'No Poo update. Last week my hair felt like doll hair. Yes, DOLL HAIR! It felt so gross. That entire week I wore my hair up in a bun. Part of the way through the week, I realized what I had been doing wrong. I had shied away from the ACV because I thought I had used to much in those first few days and it was making my hair oilier. So, I was only using BS+H2O on my hair and it was drying it out and making it feel weird. Plus, I was using it every day and wasn't supposed to. Oops! I guess my brain didn't register the part about only "washing" your hair 2x per week in the beginning. So I fixed that problem in a hurry and let my hair rest for a few days. Then, on Sunday I did a white vinegar + water pre-rinse, washed with BS + water, rinsed with ACV + water, "plopped" my hair (and did NOT use any products), then let it air dry.

Clarke’s Third Law. “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” Very well. Let us then offer... a corollary? An inverse? It has, of course, been stated before, obvious inversion that it is. But no sourced version can be located, it seems. Nobody actually knows who first inverted it. At least, out loud. In practice, for us, the name is obvious. We’ll call it Whitaker’s Law, even if he never codified it as much. No. That’s wrong. Not Whitaker’s Law. Whitaker’s Heresy.
The Japanese residents are not only ingesting mercury by eating dolphin meat. Tim Burns, a SaveJapanDolphins volunteer, have found evidence that ground dolphin meat is also used for fish farming; which means that the toxin is passed down to a fish lower on the mercury scale. A species which is believed to be safe to eat is then most likely highly elevated on the mercury chain. When consuming this fish, the Japanese residents are again exposed to high levels of mercury without even being aware of it.

Just as I was getting over the shock of my scrambled labels, I got another text. ”Ran out of newsletters for you because you ran too many labels for your members.” Somehow I’d run double labels for our members. Disheartened and confused, all I wanted to do was to drive the 50 miles to see if I could help straighten out my mess.
The last time both these fighters fought, both endings were bittersweet. For Miguel Cotto, he was finally able to get his revenge that he had been waiting for over three years now to face the man that knocked him off his undefeated pedestal, Antonio Margarito. Margarito the first time he and Cotto fought, shockingly defeated Cotto with a viscous 11th round knockout. As the fight ended, there was a close-up on Cotto’s face. It was one of the bloodiest faces I’ve seen ever after a fight. So there had to be something that wasn’t right? Which was exactly the case. It was later found out that Margarito was using illegal hand wraps in which they were soaked in plaster to make his punches feel harder than normal.
After getting the wonderful news we went to lunch and went to look at baby girl items! We didn't buy anything, but now we could officially look with a purpose. My sister Von was the most impatient one when it came to finding out. What's funny is that we had to put off our big announcement for a week because the day we found out was the day that she and her family went to Florida for vacation. Everyone tried to get clues out of me, but I'm me...I was not going to slip up. My mother had fully convinced herself that it was a boy. I know she was doing this because she wanted a girl so bad and didn't want to be disappointed. She had been saying for so long that either me or Von needed to have a little girl so that she could get started on making a little girl blanket or curtains. I had to tell her, mommy we can't guarantee the sex but we will try lol.

Overhauling equipment: If a workshop is available or can be found, each weapon or piece of armour may be overhauled once per adventure survived. The cost of overhauling a given item is 1D6x10 creds multiplied by its Rating value (S=1, M=2, V=3 and X=4). An overhaul allows a weapon to be used again or reduces the probability of a attack rolls causing a jam / failure by one degree; it restores 1 point of Protection to armour.

Sound vibrations which pass down the auditory canal in this way reach the ear drum. This membrane is so sensitive that it can even perceive vibrations on the molecular level. Thanks to the exquisite sensitivity of the ear drum, you can easily hear somebody whispering from yards away. Or you can hear the vibration set up as you slowly rub two fingers together. Another extraordinary feature of the ear drum is that after receiving a vibration it returns to its normal state. Calculations have revealed that, after perceiving the tiniest vibrations, the ear drum becomes motionless again within up to four thousandths of a second. If it did not become motionless again so quickly, every sound we hear would echo in our ears.

Specials for the Weekend of November 12th
Jerry Williams, of Little Rock, Arkansas, garnered 4th Place in the Stella’s when he was awarded $14,500 plus medical expenses after being bitten on the butt by his next door neighbor’s beagle – even though the beagle was on a chain in its owner’s fenced yard. Williams did not get as much as he asked for because the jury believed the beagle might have been provoked at the time of the butt bite because Williams had climbed over the fence into the yard and repeatedly shot the dog with a pellet gun.

After hearing about Kalydeco, I immediately saw a majority of CFers being "cured" or at least significantly treated in the directly foreseeable future. Like, 2 years tops. I was ecstatic, even allowing myself to think.... well this is tough now, but we just gotta stick it out for a few more years and then we won't have to worry about the harsh realities of CF. But after reading about the true nature of the difficulty of correcting the DF508 mutation, I'm beginning to realize that, while there is still hope, realistically it isn't going to be easy, and it isn't going to be soon. In 2020, I'll be 30 years old. That seems unfathomable right now, and that news just kind of set me back a bit.

Gluten is a protein that is naturally found in barley, oats, wheat and grains. The human diet has changed significantly over the past few hundreds of years. The human body originally survived off of plants, berries and meats. It was not until modern times that a steady flow of wheat products entered human diets through the technology of cropping and harvesting . Some people claim that the human body has not had enough time to evolve to accommodate the addition of gluten into their diets. Due to this, the body does not always know how to properly digest gluten products. It is believed that this may cause unnecessary weight gain for some people.
Unfortunatley it gets worse.
Something to consider today.
It's good to know that the courts are reluctant to place a ban on disclosure of confidential information in at least one situation -- when the secret information in question becomes too big to hide any more. This is apparent from SKA and PLM v CRH and persons unknown [2012] EWHC 766 (QB), a Queen's Bench decision of Mr Justice Tugendhat late last month. This case nearly escaped the IPKat's attention since he doesn't always spot decisions that come from the regular High Court for England and Wales rather than from the Patents Court. For the record, it's always worth checking the Queen's Bench cases to see what's cooking: big disputes involving intellectual property licences and other contractual arrangements are also often tried there.

How come we hardly ever look in that yard? Why do we take so much time focused on the small percentage of the world’s population that have it “better” than us and so little time on those in need. I know we would be quick to say it’s because looking in the dried up yard is depressing. Is it really less depressing to us when we look at what makes us jealous? I know it tends to get me down if I spend a lot of time focused on keeping up with the Jones’ and all the things I don’t have but wish I did.
Compare hope to any of the other ethical virtues celebrated in that harsh time and the distinction is even clearer. Courage, for example, isn’t a facile assurance that one is destined to win. It’s the quality of character and the act of will that does the right thing in the face of danger and fear. This is, among other things, the opposite of the conviction that victory is inevitable. That’s a logical point—if someone recognizes no danger and feels no fear, he’s not courageous no matter how many risks he unknowingly runs—but it’s also a practical one. One of the commonplaces of military history, for example, is the army that believes it can’t lose, and then collapses in panic when the battle turns against it because it has never had to grapple with the possibility of defeat.
Imagine if we could determine how big, and exactly where, a proportion of our taxes, could be spent on Transition friendly initiatives.

The media treated the Muslim bombings as if it were a natural disaster and no one was to blame to excuse it which encourages others. There is no questioning of their cultural background but blame the ”preachers of hate,” their visits to the middle east: but these have learned all about us, decided they do not like us and our ways and rejected us. This is a blow to the rulers because they pretend that these middle-class lads of the third generation, behave just like us while at the same time they promote tolerance for different cultures.

There are two pictures in the VANITY + CONSOLATION that suggest this notion of a “runaway” as deep content in the work. One photograph, depicts a young girl on a bicycle riding past a suburban home that might be her own. While passing, she looks back over her shoulder at the front door that seems to be beckoning. It is lit with the gleaming gold of sunset. (Of course, this photograph references two of William Eggleston’s pictures in The Guide. Inside his book, the first picture is of a front door of a suburban home decorated with a basket of artificial flowers and then there is picture of the tricycle on the cover. However, as you move through the sequence of pictures in my work, you see that I reference his work, but use the imagery to different ends.

5) Princess Mathilde of Belgium, Duchess of Brabant
From New York and Israel we travel next to England where the two other narrators are based. First is Izzy, who remembers her time as an Oxford student and her relationship with fellow-student Yoav. Their intimacy always seems to be compromised by Yoav's unique familial relationships. His domineering father, almost always away with his work (of which more in a minute), is kept at a distance even on the few occasions he returns to London. Most unusual is the intense connection he shares with his sister Leah, a bond close enough to appear incestuous to many observers including their former school principal and enough, although it remains platonic, to have an impact on his relationship with Izzy. Their father's work looks from the outside like the dealing of antique furniture but is in fact slightly more specific than that. His speciality is the re-location of furniture confiscated from Jews during the Second World War so that those survivors and descendants might reclaim 'all that furnished the lives they lost or the lives they dreamed of living.' He himself is on a mission to recreate his own father's study exactly as it stood on the day in 1944 when he was forced to flee Budapest, 'As if by putting all the pieces back together he might collapse time and erase regret.'

Sometimes I forget to give thanks for God's little gifts - like the fact that my child can squirm during a diaper change until I have control only over one foot, because I am holding him by the ankle, but the rest of his body in turned around and he is trying to get away. That he can crawl so quickly away from me that he is in another room and up to no good before I can turn around. That he has gained such independence that he refuses to allow me to feed him at all, even when we are in a hurry, and he wants his own spoon or fork. That he has such a voice that he will let us know he is happy or mad loudly, and increasingly with words - a loud "NO!" or a thrilled, "YAY!" or a demanding "BALL!" - even if we are in a restaurant and the other patrons are turning around. That there are many, many moments each day that I look at Charlie and don't think of Spina Bifida at all, because it fades behind his beautiful smile, sheer determination and his strength.

Teachers should be solemn, decent, and respectful. However, Cheri dressed like a high-priced street-walker, and she wore a week’s worth of makeup all at one time. The blouses she wore were like a second skin. Usually cut so low everything, God blessed her with, was visible. The dresses were too short to be considered miniskirts. She was tall and her legs went on for a country mile. Every moment that she wasn’t in school was spent tanning. Either in the sun or in a tanning bed, she took enormous pride in her appearance. Cheri didn’t see a reason to change the way she dressed or the way she acted, just because she was a teacher. She had been called out, in front of the school board several times. They first asked her to tame down her clothing. Then they demanded it. Nevertheless, Ms. Pitts wasn’t concerned with anything the board had to say about her choice of clothing. Because she believed the way she dressed had nothing to do with her teaching skills, and she was right.

Oh, and an Airedale mix for whom I was arranging rescue from deepest, darkest Appalachia was "placed" by a "local rescue". She was found two hundred miles away near my hometown a few days ago, with her spay sutures still in place and a hernia, probably from a popped stitch...she was spayed on January 7th. It's definitely the same dog- found in the county where HSUS and the Animal Legal Defense Fund are investigating the local shelter for heinous abuse and murder of animals in their care, including animals from my home county, which contracts to them for shelter services. I was e-mailing both of those organizations yesterday, and have been on the phone several times with the SPCA volunteer back home who has the dog in her custody.
What’s to say about me? Well, I’m 75 years old, semi-retired with my wife Marianne, and living in a condo in Central Florida. I was born in Manhattan (New York Hospital) but lived my childhood in Astoria, Queens. My wife lived one block away but we never met until I was about 21 years old. I enlisted in the US Navy in 1954 and served aboard 2 Aircraft Carriers, the Bennington and the Leyte. After 3 and a half years I was discharged and I worked in many different jobs. My favorite job was as a motorcycle courier for the local TV News Stations and U.P.I. I got paid to do something I loved, riding a Harley! I met my wife through her cousin and we married and had 6 children; 2 are in heaven. We now have 8 grandchildren! Most of them are living in New York and Pennsylvania, so we don’t see them too much. In 1987, on April 25th, I was ordained a deacon for the Diocese of Brooklyn and served in four parishes until 2002, when we relocated to Florida. Mainly because we couldn’t afford to live in NYC and for my wife’s health, she needed a home of her own. She has ‘end stage kidney failure’ and is expected to go on dialysis soon. Our daughter helped us buy the condo and answered my prayers that we could have our own home. Blessed be God forever! I work a part-time job to help pay for the medications and doctor visits, but it’s really tough making ends meet.

It's remarkable how time can ameliorate history. What the congregation rocking in Hyde Park probably didn't know was that long before most of them were born, Mandela was one of the leaders of the African National Congress, who created an armed wing called the Umkhonto we Sizwe or Spear of the Nation, which was dedicated to bombing civilian, industrial, military and government targets. South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has accused it of torture and executions without due process.
Right now, we are in the midst of integrating the fact that we are energetic beings in an energetic universe. This principle is both ancient and primal. It is at the basis of understanding in tribal cultures, and it is echoed in the mystic branches of all faiths. It is also at the basis of our “science,” as both Einstein and the quantum physicists discovered when they looked further into the nature of “matter” and realized that we are in fact energy surrounded by energy.

The chocolate moustache favours are also such a yummy idea, and finally the picture of daddy and Braden wearing matching bow ties is so super cute!!

The blatant anti-woman, anti-mom attack on Ann Romney by WH propagandist Hilary Rosen is par for the femisogynist course. Starting back in . . . oh, who the hell knows, but it was decades ago . . . “feminists” started attacking “traditional gender roles,” demanding that women be “free” to . . . well, to fit their mold as pseudo-men (being a stay-at-home-mom was right up there with being a “bitter clinger”). Anyone not adhering to this new policy of “women have to be men to succeed” was to be ridiculed and shunned.

Cease from thy unbelief, O my brother,
Yes, these boots were maybe the best looking pair she’d ever seen. And just as she was having that thought, another one came right on the heels of it.
Shea butter is mostly used in cosmetics and medicinal ointments as a base or because of it’s moisturizing properties. Shea butter is solid, but its melting point is very close to the temperature of the human body (37 degrees Celcius), so that after a bit of rubbing, the butter becomes liquid again so it can be easily spread and absorbs quickly into the skin.

Solving the nation’s most entrenched problems This bitterly adversarial private enforcement system has had a toxic effect on American public schools. Because the law is poorly funded (Congress has repeatedly broken its promises to the states), a school district will often make funding decisions about regular education services with an eye toward whether a disgruntled parent of a disabled student might claim that the decisions negatively impact special education services. School staff feel that parents see them as obstacles, not advocates, to the education that the parents envision — and parents feel as though schools see them as demanding, insensitive consumers who view school staff as private servants.
I was still hopeful that the process would be painless. I was able to find a dress for my son's wedding with relative ease, in a local dress shop eight years ago. Of course, it helped that I was younger and thinner in 2004. I loved the Jasmine/Jade brand dress I wore, as it fit so perfectly right off the rack. I didn't need one alteration! Unfortunately, the dress shop I bought this dress from was no longer open, so I knew I would have to look elsewhere this time.
You know exactly what would happen, there would be an outcry, it would be called “racism”, “imperialism”, “Colonialism” and an outrageous attack on the local culture.
Prison = punishmentThat's a typical framework for thinking about community supervision, but I also happen to think it's grievously flawed. He did caveat this statement by adding:
Funny also because it encourages me to practice what I preach as well. I think being their teacher inspires me to greater growth as well. Hopefully all of this togetherness will help us continue to grow the warmth in our hearts for our little microcosm and for the macrocosm of it all.
I also am a major list making. I make a list everyday. Nothing feels so good as checking something off my list. Unfortunately, I never check off my entire list each day and am always adding to it.
I planted a giant sunflower out of its (greenhouse seeded) pot in May, thinking how lovely the vision that, in a summer like 2005, 2004, 2001 or 1998 (‘Global warming’ years) it might set seed to feed finches by autumn.

While foremost a love story, the film doesn’t sugar-coat the place and time. Chico and Rita, both black Cubans, have to deal with discrimination and exploitation as they work their way up the commercial ladder and without giving anything anyway, their story is bittersweet.
And maybe her intentions were to provoke and to exploit. Intentions are important when a work of art is conceived and created, but not very important once it is released into the world, because audiences can have all sorts of ways of responding to and interpreting the work on their own. That's part of the fun of being a reader or viewer. Even if we grant the, I think, shaky premise that Hadzihalilovic intended to provoke and fetishize with this movie*, that does not lead inevitably to the movie being provocative and fetishistic, for a few different reasons: no matter how auteurist a director (or writer-director, in this case), there are still lots of other people involved in making a film; more importantly, it's difficult to translate intentions into material that then communicates those intentions to an audience without noise getting into the equation on either side of the material (otherwise, everyone who intended to make a profound and lasting work of art would be successful).

We have this massive mirror. It is so big that it takes two to three men to lift and move it. So we had somebody in to hang it when we moved into this house as I can not lift it and it needed to be hung quite high, so had somebody in to hang it for us. Well during the night we were all awoken to this almighty bang. My son came in early saying we had to come and see and not to be mad "he didn't do it" LOL

“Miss Silver paid close attention to the strange tale of sensible, middle-aged Miss Paulina Paine. Though totally deaf, Miss Paine could lip-read so well that strangers never suspected her handicap-or guessed she could eavesdrop with uncanny accuracy. She had been, she told Miss Silver, on the far side of a spacious art gallery, but her “listening eye” was not mistaken; she distinctly “heard” two men planning both a theft and a murder.
Vince didn’t particularly like pork-chops, but he didn’t hate them either. Then again, he really couldn’t complain since he didn’t do any of the cooking. Jenny cooked most of the time. He’d hide out and try to avoid it, only lending a hand when it was something that piqued his interest like steak or ribs. When it came to anything on the grill, he had it covered. Or at least he thought he did.

Here we are; a year after I wrote the story. I am sitting in the hospital next to Tomas' crib while he sleeps. He has been inpatient for 7 days in order to have some procedures done and some tests run. This makes 4 hospital stays in 4 months for a total of 20 admissions in his 32 months of life. Tomas has had a rough few months; 2 line infections, one that was pretty severe, degenerating gut motility, progressive liver damage from the tpn, re-discovery of the ASD in his heart, a recommendation from one of his specialists that he be evaluated for a mitochondiral disorder, chronic neutropenia which prompted another bone marrow biopsy and some neutrophil testing, and another fasting study to get to the bottom of the metabolic disease causing his hypoglecemia. The goal of this hospital stay was to be able to safely reduce the number of hours his TPN runs in a day, in the hopes that we can slow the liver disease and possibly reverse it. In order to do this he has to be able to fast as he can not take in enough volume by tube feedings anymore to reliably count on enteral feeds as a source of glucose. Before admit he was fasting 4 hours and we are going home tomorrow with a plan for fasting 6 hours.
A news article came out yesterday talking about a dolphin that is trapped in a wetlands area in California. The interesting part is that what is blocking him is a pair of dolphins who will not let it pass. It seems that bullying occurs in the wild as well.
Meryon said the service attracts 500 to 600 Israeli and Palestinian believers, and that number is growing as more and more local Christians become aware of the safe haven and the platform for reconciliation that the Garden Tomb provides.

By the time we reach Helugi, rain-soaked, footsore, bored with our diet of rice and cold noodles, struggling to maintain the morale of our increasingly disenchanted porters, we’re fair game for chief Siamo. He persuades us to take part in a pig festival, a tradition in which the visitors buy a pig and the villagers eat it. In return, they put on their war paint, tool up and stage a mock battle.
I suppose that I should be used to it now. It never quite goes the way I figure it would. I say this not only about the labyrinth, but also meditation, heck magickal work even. There are always surprises in store it would seem. Such was last night.

6. You ought to detox at least one time a year. A light detoxifying plan is generally safe; as a matter of fact, scientific fields of study show that a detox is beneficial for health. You ought to be heedful if you are a nursing mom, youngster, and patients with chronic degenerative diseases, cancer or TB. Confer with your healthcare practitioner if you've questions about whether detoxing is proper for you. At the start, lighten your toxin load. Do away with intoxicants, coffee,smokes, sugars and saturated fats, all of which act as toxins in the system and are obstacles to the process. Minimize utilization of chemical-based home cleaners and personal healthcare products (cleaners, shampoos, deodorants and toothpastes), and replace with natural alternatives.

With 5,000 years of history, only the most close-minded of Sinophobes would argue that China does not have its own set of values. Confucianism, Taoism, Buddhism and yes, Communism, have each had their impact on Chinese society and have each left behind traces of themselves to be absorbed into a larger whole. The problem lies in the fact that China has changed more in the last sixty years (one could even argue only thirty years) than it had in the last thousand, and one cannot help wondering whether the CCP’s value-bashing – or rather its efforts to align “universal values” with the alleged moral bankruptcy of the West – is an attempt to cast a smoke screen to hide some uncomfortable truths about its own citizens it would rather not acknowledge.
Pre-heat the oven to 325°F. Place the chopped white chocolate into a heat safe bowl and set aside. Bring the 1/2 cup of cream to a simmer over medium heat in a small sauce pan.

I was lucky enough to see two different mekes. The traditional Fijian meke (dance) is a fierce, war-like affair danced with spears and machetes. The men stomp, leap, charge, and yell, giving me the impression that a Fijian warrior would not be someone to tangle with lightly. In classic Fijian style, we saw the meke danced at our “resort” on Taveuni, by the uncle and cousins of our divemaster. Everyone in Fiji is related within a region, it seems.
I had never tried yam before meeting him, he is West African so for him yams are a staple. I guess I was a bit intimidated by the thing, it’s not the most inviting piece of vegetable out there. I’m glad I did try it, it’s delicious, and very versatile. This time around we boiled it and had it with stew. Last night a spicy one with lots of chilli powder, today a milder one for me.
By the next day, Jeff and I had to really sit down and talk about what we were ready for. Trip with all or just trip with Jeff.

In Navajo Courts and Navajo Common Law, Justice Austin considers the history and implications of how the Navajo Nation courts apply foundational Navajo doctrines to modern legal issues. He explains key Navajo foundational concepts like Hózhó (harmony), K’é (peacefulness and solidarity), and K’éí (kinship) both within the Navajo cultural context and, using the case method of legal analysis, as they are adapted and applied by Navajo judges in virtually every important area of legal life in the tribe.
Yesterday afternoon through Sunday I will be working at Meadow Lane Lodge & Cottages; manning the phones, checking email, and reserving stays. It is a nice change from the usual pod life that I live at Clarkson & Wallace. Driving up the lane, through fog laden fields, catching glimpses of the dew encrusted webs in the tall grass - stunning. The batteries in my camera have died and I will have to wait until lunch before I can get more. Meadow Lane has a resident male peacock, amongst other farm animals (and babies!); he is so beautiful! I will capture a picture of him and the other farm babies.

I’m also a positive guy, when I’m watching a slasher movie, I always think „Maybe this group of young people doesn’t consist from total morons.” And then one of them says „Hey, guys, I think we should split up in this spooky abandoned hospital.” and everyone is like „Ok.” and then Shaggy is like „Zoinks, Scoobie!” as eventually the cannibalistic inbred freaks appear.
On January 31st at the Wynkoop will be OvalOptions' first session of The Pub Dialogues; an effort to bring people out of the chat room and into the pub. Online dialogue, discussion, chat, forums and the like have just about killed debate, discussion, communication and dialogue about important (even trivial) topics. The Internet has affected the real world, from presidential elections to neighbor to neighbor relations. People have forgotten how to talk with each other.

The Old Testament book of Hosea is the story of God’s faithful love for His unfaithful people. In what seems strange to us, the Lord commanded Hosea to marry a woman who would break her marriage vows and bring grief to him (Hosea 1:2-3). After she deserted Hosea for other men, the Lord told him to take her back–a picture of “the love of the LORD for the children of Israel, who look to other gods”(3:1).

When the war between Britain and France began again in 1803, Britain was once more concerned about the possibility that France might take over the Cape, as a result of which a large British fleet arrived at the Cape in January 1806, and soon defeated the Dutch troops. Again no changes were made in the way that the Cape was governed, except that it was no longer ruled by a Company but by a Governor appointed by the British Government, and the burghers at the Cape were allowed to trade more freely than they had been able to before.

When I feel it's time to rotate, I empty out that bag, put all the products back in it's proper place (I like it organized, please), then fill the bag back up again with other products. It's a process I began about 6 months ago when I changed up my makeup organization and I like how it's working.

I’ve put together a playlist to listen to as I walk. Right now I just put it on shuffle & let it go. Eventually I may get all organized & try to put it in order of length of song or something so I can use that to time my walk. Here’s what I have so far:

Martin Gordon has packed a lot into his 30+ years in the music business. From Glam to Punk to perfect 80’s pop to an accomplished solo career, he’s done it all (see my earlier Martin Gordon review here for more info!). Linking all these together is his distinctive bass sound and an ever-present talent for writing intelligent, quirky and original songs. Add to this a brief stint as a Rolling Stone and working with the likes of Blur, Primal Scream, Boy George and George Michael and you’ve got a very full and varied career... One I've been itching to find out more about for some time!
It definitely had superb imagery and a fantastical setting with mysterious characters, but it was so very slow, and I feel like I never really got to know the characters. There were some that I could have done without and others that I would have loved to have spent more time with. Ultimately, I'll go with "just okay," but I think I liked it even less. :(
All this was to make it clear that my French is terrible….ok, non-existent. The Frenchman could speak English, barely. But we decided to tour Washington D.C together. We did the usual touristy stuff, went up to the Washington monument, Jefferson memorial, Lincoln memorial, et all. I helped him out in ticket counters, took pictures of him with his camera, he took pictures of me with my camera, had lunch. It was fun to discover a new city with a new friend. At the end of the day we parted ways without exchanging numbers or promises to stay in touch. We both knew that this was where our camaraderie ended.
