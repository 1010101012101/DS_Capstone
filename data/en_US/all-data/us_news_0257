James Nagamatsu, I read your article about WW II, the Japanese Internment. If I could talk to Nagamatsu personally I would ask him if he is still dwelling on how ruthlessly Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, killed many of our people and did mass destruction to our ships. One, The Arizona battle ship, still has more than a thousand men entombed on board. I think he should get over it. I'm sure that hindsight is always better than foresight. I'm wondering if he knows who started the war? It sure wasn't Roosevelt. I'm sure he was as shook up as everyone else.

"Hate to defend #RushLimbaugh but he apologized, liberals looking bad not accepting. Also hate intimidation by sponsor pullout," wrote Maher on his Twitter feed Wednesday. Of course, Maher's been accused of saying some pretty crass gynecological things about Sarah Palin and other conservative women, so he might have a vested interest in damping down the fire here. ...

Kaldor Projects made little brochures and they used the Internet to ask people to send in their stories, and they've collected all their stories. It's a team of people who work on it.

No, he decided we were going to discuss South Chicago Neighborhood House. (He's insistent and pushy that way, which has been a good thing for South Chicago.) He wanted to talk about how Neighborhood House, open as a settlement house since 1919, was forced to close in June because of a lack of funding. But Bosanko, a former director there, understood the community needed Neighborhood House; it kept seniors involved and kids off the streets. As one young man at the living memorial said of Bosanko and his days at Neighborhood House: "Thank you for making my childhood better."

“The inescapable fact is that by releasing so much information regarding his finances, Mitt Romney is clearly coming down on the side of disclosure,” spokeswomen Andrea Saul said. “There are more than 1,500 entries between the 2007 and 2011 financial disclosures, and any documents with this level of complexity and detail are bound to have a few trivial inadvertent issues.

“It’s hard in this game to find someone who is a superstar and just walk up to him and talk to him and be able to tell him sometimes what they don’t want to hear.

You can talk to players about him in the minor leagues. I challenge you to find somebody who doesn’t respect Dale and hasn’t connected with him on a pretty meaningful level.”

Reyes started 32 games at UConn as a defensive tackle, 10 more as a defensive end, and he often moved among several spots in the middle of a game.

The problem now is that there are so many players with large contracts and varying degrees of no-trade rights that the flexibility is limited. That's why you see the names of Carlos Quentin and Matt Thornton frequently mentioned. They're under contract with no full no-trade rights. One emailer took me to task for alleging that I wrote that the Sox could get a pitcher in return for Quentin. What the emailer failed to see was that the Sox could get at least one pitcher in return as well as another prospect, since Quentin could be a Type A free agent under the Elias rankings (although Quentin isn't eligible for free agency until after the 2012 season) and command two draft picks if he were eligible for free agency.

The 76ers displayed much more energy and passion Tuesday night than they did Saturday despite the emotional wave coming from the other side. Derrick Rose's presence at the arena just three days after suffering a postseason-ending ACL tear electrified the crowd and gave the Bulls an early boost. That would explain why the 76ers trailed 55-47 at halftime despite holding their own on the boards, outscoring the Bulls in transition and shooting 52.8 percent from the field.
And beating Ohio State in pursuit of that goal can be cause for celebration.

She said she wanted to show off Gloria's sweet, down-to-earth personality. "She expressed a love for texture and color but a habit of 'throwing things on.' I knew a lighthearted menswear look would be perfect. It is a fun, relaxed outfit with the perfect amount of sparkle and sass."

The legislation’s sponsors — Senate President Stephen Sweeney (D-Gloucester), Sen. Jeff Van Drew (D-Cape May) and Assemblyman John Burzichelli (D-Gloucester) — say the bill was an attempt to be humane to ailing animals in a state with a growing shelter population. But amid howls from animal rights groups, they say they didn’t intend for the clause to allow quick euthanization.
Most of all, he was driven to succeed, whether it meant winning every game when it came to the Yankees or making the most money when it came to his other business dealings. That drive, which many amateur psychiatrists pegged as his never-ending, futile effort to please his stern father, prompted his often bizarre actions.

Saleh stepped down in February after months of protests by millions of Yemenis who rose up against 33 years of dictatorial rule that saw the country's economy deteriorate and al-Qaeda's presence expand.
Several of the Queen Victoria's shortcomings are not open to debate. Standard outside staterooms (like mine) are a good size for a cruise ship, about 180 to 200 square feet. But there's little drawer space, and baths are so small there's barely room to turn around in the shower. Malfunctioning toilets also were a problem.

Curiously, the Jaguars have the seventh overall pick - one spot ahead of the Dolphins - and they have no need for Tannehill, who is considered the third-best QB, since they drafted Blaine Gabbert last year.
There’s room for improvement. The team could retire Torre’s number 6, not to mention Bernie Williams’ 51, Posada’s 20 and maybe even Paul O’Neill’s 21. However, there’s no business imperative, no fan clamoring, to hold such ceremonies. The same goes for Roger Clemens, whom the Yankees have virtually ignored since the release of the Mitchell Report — much to the apathy of those who buy Yankees tickets and goods.
Even so, St. Luke’s already has received requests for milk from hospitals as far away as South Carolina and New Jersey.
Burnett attributes much of their success to a high level of flexibility among his position players: nine of the 13 players are capable pitchers.

So what is it about poor neighborhoods that explains the heightened risk? To find out, the researchers gathered information on all road traffic injuries on the Island of Montreal between 1999 and 2003. (The island is served by a single ambulance company, which provided records for the study.) The researchers focused on 19,568 accident victims who got hurt at 17,498 intersections, all of which were located in census tracts with at least some residents. Intersections that straddled multiple census tracts, were adjacent to highway on-ramps or were in purely industrial or commercial areas were not included in the analysis.

Though there's no word yet on whether there will be more episodes of "Portlandia," Jennifer Caserta, general manager of IFC, says the show is a good fit for the cable channel.

'Portlandia' combines all that."

Unlike Eckford, Minnijean Brown-Trickey, another of the Little Rock Nine, is gregarious and comfortable speaking to a crowd.

-- Wear baggy rain pants that cinch or snap at the bottom. You want something baggy enough to pull over any work outfit and keep the water from dripping into your shoes. I've had the same pair of rain pants for 15 years (and they lasted me through six Seattle winters of riding). They're not pretty, but they do the job. When I arrive at work, I just peel off the pants and my work clothes are dry and wrinkle-free, just as I left them.
Schwartz said he was very pleased with the explanation Reiff gave him regarding the episode when they interviewed him during the NFL combine in February. Schwartz called him a model citizen since that incident.
As for where this is going, let past be prologue: Once the players lose five or six checks, they’ll acquiesce, bend, cave. And the one benefit is that we’ll get the season we prefer, when every game matters, when intensity jumps another notch on the ratchet, and when 29 cities get to dream of lightning in a bottle, while Dan Gilbert prepares for another lottery.
The total impact is probably much higher. The system paid $34 million in benefits in 2010, according to the system's annual reports, six times the $5.5 million it paid in 1980. Even accounting for inflation, payouts have more than doubled.
