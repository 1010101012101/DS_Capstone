The situations requiring reports to child protective services were the longest, darkest days and nights of my life but it had to be done.

These are small solutions to small problems. That’s exactly where you need to start—with a less-than-earthshattering problem. You need to bulk up your creativity muscles, since they’ve been neglected for a while. You’ll be amazed how quickly you get creatively toned and fit if you keep tackling those small projects. And how those creative, problem-solving muscles can get used in so many parts of your life.
Over the next decade, I consumed all the guitarists I could find: Charley Patton and Lead Belly, who was a genius, as was Skip James, Scrapper Blackwell, all the Blinds (Lemon Jefferson, Blake, Willie Johnson, Willie McTell), Son House, Lightnin’ Hopkins, Bo Diddley, Muddy Waters and so many more that we’d be here all night just naming a tenth of them.
Is there are more gruesome description in the whole of gastronomy than non-specific “meat”? Even ignoring the horrors disguised by that blandishment, the meat and potato pie sandwich was a monstrosity. You bought a microwaved Holland’s pie, sprinkled Beef Monster Munch on top of it, drizzled it with brown sauce, and stuck the whole thing into an oven-bottom muffin. It was about 5 inches thick, and at least 3 inches of that was fat.

Instead of emailing your sponsor to ask how to cancel GDI work on a different email that invites prospects to check out GDI. You’re mistaken if you think you’ve “run out of people to ask” because remember GDI is global. You’ll never run out of people no matter how hard you try. You can send that single email to an endless amount of people inviting them to take a look at a way to earn more money for just $10/month. You can even tweak that email as you review your results and no matter what that email will always accomplish a lot more than an email to your sponsor asking how to cancel (remember you only save $10 by cancelling). Instead of searching the internet for “how to cancel GDI” take some time instead to search for ways to get traffic to your GDI site, how to convert your existing traffic or even how to develop your downline. This information is out there and its all free for the taking. Being a successful entrepreneur with any business doesn’t require resources. It only requires resourcefulness.

Slightly less wonderful has been my battle with the current work-in-progress. Honestly, I have never agonised so much about a book before, NEVER. I don't want to sound melodramatic or pretentious (much), but I have just been tearing my hair out over how I could get it to work. It started off as a one-person narrative but then a few months ago, I decided to add in another storyline from a second main character, hoping to weave them together. The storylines and characters were quite different, so the idea was that they would complement each other and then tie in beautifully towards the end. Well, that was the plan, anyway.

Summer in the Netherlands is the best season of the year to travel around and get to see and experience all the cultural aspects of this incredible country. From north to south, west to east, the whole country seems to come out of its cocoon and burst into fun activities which are mostly carried out in the open, to celebrate the sun and compensate for the long months of winter inertia.

Grandpa Williams worked for the railroad for years. He was also a councilman in Spokane. But, the best story I heard was the one where Grandpa Williams beat up Bing Crosby when he was little. Just punched him right in the nose. I bet it wasn’t a White Christmas that year, Bing. Sounds like my grandpa may have been a bully. He must have liked beating up Bing, because he was also a pretty good boxer. I don’t know how many fights he won, but he quit boxing after a man he was fighting died after Grandpa punched him in the temple. That was sad and all hearing that story, but all I could think about was if his nose was that big from getting punched in the boxing ring over time. I thought it was a pretty good reason why someone would have such a big nose.

Between 1950 and 1973 (the year of the embargo) U.S. oil imports had grown from near zero to about 32 percent of U.S. oil consumption.”(2) Other factors behind the increase include “predictions that the U.S. will exhaust it’s supply of oil in as little as forty years, an ever increasing demand from population growth, new uses found for the resource, and an increase in demand for a resource to increase living standards.”(5)

The tree saw the beautiful flowers blooming freshly in the garden. It saw itself, and wished that they had left it in the darkest corner of the garret.

This past weekend was the 3rd and final weekend of the Shop Hop. I went to 3 stores and enjoyed each one. I worked with well over 100 consumers. We made Tubes and Magic Wands in Christmas, Halloween and Princess. I love seeing little ones use the products. We had them as young as 3.
My heart caught in my throat as she recalled those nights. She was there when I wasn't. She was caring for them, loving them before I ever was. And now, she looks at me and thinks the same thing... I am here when she isn't. There's never been a time in their lives that they were ever alone or unloved. Not one moment. I am so thankful that Grace and Kaylee were so loved from their very beginning. Laurel was loving them, fighting for their little lives. Then she took such a courageous step by offering us the opportunity to be their parents. It's really overwhelming to think about how intricately God's hand was and is over all of us.

Ah, the inaugural post of a blog. It's kinda weird writing this thing. I mean, in normal blog posts, you're talking to an existing audience, but in this case, there is no audience. I mean, I just started this thing half an hour ago. So I guess I'm really writing to future readers, aren't I? Let's take a minute to address them now.
It was huge in its day. Less obviously territorial than the Napoleonic wars, this one seemed a simple matter of standing up to the aggression of Russia, who was trying to wrest control of Jerusalem from the poor little Muslim Turks. When Russia brutally massacred the Turkish fleet at Sinope, the public's sense of chivalry was touched, just as sixty years later it would be moved by the plight of ‘poor little Belgium’. And so the bells rang for war and the ogre of the Russian Bear dominated the newspapers quite as much as ‘Boney’ ever had.

This cabinet of millionaires is happy to consign the life-chances of thousands to the scrapheap, and in doing so to debase our over-materialist culture still further, despite being the beneficiaries of the system themselves. David Willetts (private school and Oxford, degree in that distinctly non-STEM subject PPE, wealth estimated at £2 million) is presiding over a regime he himself declared unfair in his own book. Dave, descended from one of William IV's bastards (Eton, Oxford, Bullingdon Club, PPE again, personal wealth about £25 million) says "We won't go back. Look, even if we wanted to, we shouldn't go back to the idea that university is free." I never thought it was. When I was at university, I received a grant. It covered the cost of my rent. For the rest, I depended, as everyone else I knew did, on parental contributions. My parents were fantastically supportive, making real sacrifices to help me. But neither they, nor I, were faced with the prospect of a £30,000 price tag for a degree. The chancellor, George Osborne (St Paul's, Oxford, degree in History, personal wealth £4 million trust fund, heir to a baronetcy) says "Our universities are jewels in our economic crown, and it is clear that if we want to keep our place near the top of the world league tables then we need to reform our system of funding." OK, George - but reform to you means slashing the budget to almost nothing for the subject you studied at university. I could go on, but you get the idea. It doesn't help when people like Simon Jenkins write fatuously that "It may be irksome for poor students to see rich ones having their fees paid off by parents, but the rich are always different." That's Sir Simon Jenkins, (Mill Hill, Oxford, degree in a subject he seems coy about, but I bet it wasn't engineering) who has the nerve to say that "There is not an arts course invented that could not be completed in 18 months, and probably not a science one. As for most postgraduate degrees and doctorates, they are plain indulgences." Oxford terms are eight weeks...

So lost, so confused, yet unaware of it in the main, most inhabit a world handed to them, shaped and fitted and honed, most live and die in innocence, unknowing and wholly unaware.

This is not to say the book isn’t good. It’s not awful at all, it’s just not my cup of tea. I’m sure there are a fair amount of people who would really enjoy Suspicion. It’s the type of book I think would work well as holiday reading, on a beach somewhere. It’s not a long book at all, I started and finished it today, and for its length, a fair amount happens. There is suspense and there is danger, pretty much like a sinister Mean Girls, and those moments kept me reading to find out exactly what was going on, despite not being a huge fan of the characters. I’ve got to say, I really liked Sawyer though, he was just a sweetie! Upton wasn’t too awful either, though I found him too English; the phrases he used aren’t something you would hear every day over here – but then again he is rich, and so probably posh. I don’t come across many posh Englishmen.
Supposedly the secondary schools these children will move to in September will have a clearer idea of the children's abilities.

I really loved the apple filling with the 2 cups of blackberries. It adds a wonderfully unexpected twist.

This apple-blackberry pie is definitely worth making again but with the simple pate brisee crust.

If your beef is that the project won’t be sustainable – think of all the ways that it could be, and all the things it could bring to the city.

Is it right or sustainable to expect our Mass-going population of 21,000 to support our schools and colleges in which often the majority of pupils, and sometimes teachers, are not practising Catholics?

Why is the gospel message today to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ when God told Israel to obey His voice and keep His commandments (Exodus 19:5). We will find the answer in the book of Acts. Why is it that by grace we are saved and yet Jesus toldIsraelto endure to the end to be saved? Why is it that we have redemption through the blood of Christ when Peter told the Jews to repent and be baptised? Are there contradictions in the Bible? There are many questions and we will answer every one of them as we study this wonderful book of Acts.

Legend has it, that in 1864, most of downtown Oxford was incinerated by the drunken troops of Union General A. J. “Whiskey” Smith. A few of the buildings on campus survived, including the new observatory, which was preserved by an earlier order from Gen.

The lines at Brooklyn's IKEA have turned the shopping experience into a nightmare. This past Friday afternoon we really need some storage units. The shopping itself took maybe 20 minutes. The line, however, took 40 minutes, possibly longer. There were only five check out counters running and the lines extended past several aisles of the packaged tables and chairs.
If you are buying real estate, one of the first questions is, “What’s your budget?” When you are shopping for bar stools one of the first questions is, “How often will the bar stools be used?” If the answer is every day, then you will need either metal stools or something in wood that's well made.
Where you live multiculturalism can seem to mean little more than having easier access to chickpeas and couscous while watching that nice George Alagiah read you the news in the evening.

My suggestions are blunt and to the point but if you think back to when you purchased your home; how adamant you were at doing whatever necessary to get your mortgage loan closed. Now you should do the same thing to pay the payment so that you do not lose the equity you have built up. If you live in the city, I know that you can get the regular channels and no it might not have all the movies you want, but how much time do you have for movies anyway? Why do you need the home phone if you have the cell phone and vice versa. No, I do not like traveling without my cell phone but I do not have a home phone as of this date and haven't for a long time. There are many ways to cut corners if one desires. It is so important to keep your credit in tact because it is one of the hardest areas in your life to overcome if you fall behind with your mortgag payments. They are more than any other debt you have...and if it is not, then shame on you.

On my Bounty Hunter, for example, Mako was a sufficient “healer” who kept me from dying while I took the hits and dealt the damage. That was OK. On my Inquisitor, however, my companion is a “tank” who will keep the attention of whoever I am attacking. This is fine in theory, but in practice my “tank” felt underpowered at times and difficult to heal. There is no “Mend Pet” ability. I have a Heal that I can use on anyone, including myself, but to target my “pet” and use this… during battle… was difficult. I could not deal damage while healing. That, and the ability did not restore much health to my Companion.

Unbuttered popcorn is a great low-fat snack and can be flavored many ways. Salt and vinegar is a popular flavoring for home-popped popcorn. The idea for flavoring popcorn this way came from traditionalal British salt and vinegar potato chips. Salt and vinegar flavoring can be used on popcorn, chips, french fries or just about any other snack.
Moving on; why is it that company’s force us to dress in attire that emits an aura of copious bags of douche? It’s not even a fact of what I prefer anymore; this style of clothing has a reflection on the company. Say I become a business man one day, when I walk into the office as a potential client, what part about strangulating shirt collars and fashionable nooses is supposed to be appealing to me? Who was the guy who decided this is the model of success? Because I for one think it’s a perfect model for self-mutilation. I’d rather see everyone in comfortable attire: something that will allow them more mobility to wrestle the bullshit flying at them day in and day out.

We have heard a lot about rakyat who participated in Bersih 3.0 acting violently by overturning a police patrol car, and hence the rakyat “damaged” - “police” property. Bernama the “pride” of our nation has reported this :

The fashion council released its own guidelines to designers and modeling agencies last season, asking them not to use models younger than 16 on their runways, and most have complied. Last season, Marc Jacobs refused to stick to these ideals and continued to use some models under that age in his show. On a personal note, I’ve always agreed with these guidelines and have parted company with designers who refuse to comply with them.
So I'm trying to make this - my thinking about place, and rules around writing, form, structural decisions, the things I'm learning about myself through teaching and planning projects, my wish to help other people and myself to finding a place to be creative in - all these thoughts - into something useful for me to take into the planning phases of my next novel, which is glimmering in the corner of my eye and needs some attention.

I have it on very good authority, by the way, that the secret diaries of Robert Maxwell have been found during the renovation of his one-time yacht, Ghislane. These state unequivocally that Rupe is the nicest man in the world, and gave most of his money to Jewish charities. Sir Hugh Trevor-Roper has been exhumed and given the diairies the nod, so they will be serialised in this weekend’s Sunday Times. Said Tom Baldwin, “I’ve hacked into Murdoch’s bank account because he deserves it the bastard, I always hated him, and I’m confident that a cheque made out to Rob Max (1978) Ltd is the smoking gun in all this. What a turn-up!”
And if you don't think this book covers a good portion of the obscure, even the time Geofrey Crozier went wild and started throwing spears and pyrotechnics into the audience before knocking his cauldron over gets mention so you know this wasn't one of those piecemeal affairs! Of course a stickler like myself woulda loved to've read about the time Lou Rone got his group Cross banned from the club 'round Thanksgiving '75 after setting his guitar on fire and pissing on it to put the fire out (and this after CBGB owner Hilly Kristal beamed proud approval at Lou's guitar prowess!) but like, we can't have EVERYTHING! But we got this, and until the next book on the heyday of seventies underground rock hits my boudoir I guess it will more'n hafta do. And for that I'm at least a slight tickled pink about it!
A LONG-DEAD WISE MAN:
I've always written something. When I was in grade school I wrote plays and conscripted the kids in my neighborhood to play the parts. We would put on plays in my grandfather's garage and charge a nickel. No overhead. No capital investment. All profit. Maybe all that early financial success is what kept me engaged in writing. Probably not. I just like doing it.
This "journalist" - and I use the term VERY lightly - from the San Francisco Chronicle, has a paying job, where he can write a vile, racist, sexist piece and pollute the world with his unwanted opinion. He is upset that the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is made up of White men (apart from 4 females)! Mr Joshua Kosman - last I looked it was a free world and we don't need to pander to your libtard measurements, where everything is scrutinised to see how many different races and sexes there are represented everywhere. You don't get to squeal like a little pink pig when there isn't a MINORITY on the team. You call it "racial and sexual discrimination" - and I call you a tosser. You are an example of what is wrong in this world with your air of self-importance, yet vacuous non-opinion. Just reading your piece of racist filth is enough to make me pop an optic vein. Have you ever thought that the reason the VPO is one of the finest orchestras is the world is because of it's history and culture - an orchestra made great because of its team members?? What would make you happy Mr Kosman? Would destroying this orchestra so that you, a turd living in San Francisco, can have your little minority and a few more females on the team? Would that make Joshy Woshy happy? I tell you what, why don't you round up a few non-White males and some females and form your own "representative" orchestra and show the VPO how it's done - instead of whining about it, like the coward you are - in the newspaper? Until then, take your stupid one-eye biased view and shove it where your head apparently resides. I urge all of you out there to email Mr Kosman and let him know how much you value his anti-white views: jkosman@sfchronicle.com.
Apple, via Smashwords, has allowed me to give the reader that reason. It's called 'free'. Amazon hasn't. I got lucky with Apple because Apple allowed me to make my own luck. Enough readers felt they got lucky with my free writing that some of them have taken a chance on my writing that isn't free. On Amazon, Thagoth has two reviews; one by me and one by a friend of mine. On Apple, Thagoth has fifteen ratings, all by people I have never met. And they came to Thagoth by reading the free novelette 'The Thief Who Spat in Luck's Good Eye' and liking it.

Next is the argument that the “sign is more complete.” Yes, the sign of sacrifice is more complete. But the lay people cannot offer the Sacrifice of the Mass, only a priest can. We can however unite ourselves with priest at Mass and offer ourselves and our sufferings as sacrifices. But we once again have the blurring of lines.

That’s it for this one, thanks for stopping by!
Rankin’s accompanists from time to time included Alan Broadbent, Mike Wofford and Bill Watrous, and on such occasions the mood slips easily into a jazz groove. His compositions have been performed by artists such as Mel Tormé and Carmen McRae, while Stan Getz said of him that he was “a horn with a heartbeat”. Rankin was deeply interested in Brazilian music and his Here In My Heart, on which he used jazz guests including Michael Brecker and Ernie Watts, was recorded mostly in Rio De Janeiro. More contemporary songs were given an airing following his move to Verve Records, including the Beatles’ “I’ve Just Seen A Face” and Leon Russell‘s “A Song For You.”
Your Friend,
Shane was a nice enough of a person, so I figured what the hell, I could use a massage. I told her to come over with Cathy and afterwards, we’d have Sinagang na Baboy for lunch (a tamarind flavored soup that usually has okra, tomatoes, and pork belly). I laid a towel on the bed, unlocked the door, disrobed, and laid down on the bed to wait for Shane and Cathy. (It’s customary to have massages in the nude when in your own home in the Philippines). After a few short minutes, the two filipinas arrived, laughing and singing as filipinas often do. I heard the faint sound of “It’s not about the money“, emanating from one of the girl’s cellphones as they walked through the door.
If there is one word which perfectly suits the adjective “global” well, that is definitely “internet”. Nothing is more widespread than the web, Coca Cola excluded, probably. But unlike a drink, which can be sold and consumed anywhere in the world without any problem, a web site needs to deliver a content, hence it needs to be understood.

It is impossible to have a "best of" list without including one true IPA, the favorite style of good beer fans throughout Beervana. It's equally as impossible to identify a "best" IPA--there are just too many good ones. I'm selecting Terminal Gravity, though, because no brewery other than BridgePort is more associated with its IPA than Terminal Gravity. The little brewery from Enterprise, in the far Northeast corner of the state, has always found an audience in the cutthroat Portland market, and many people call this their favorite beer in the world. Who can argue? It's a burly ale with a thick mouthfeel and a saturated bitterness that satisfies the most inveterate hophead.

He goes back downstairs and I hear the battle take up again. I start speaking faster. The boys start banging, loudly, on something. I don’t know what. I figure I’ll find out soon enough. The dog is barking. I speed up even more. I’m probably sounding like an auctioneer on cocaine right about now. The sooner I can wrap up this call, the better.
Westbrook Brewing is a relatively new craft brewery in Mount Pleasant, SC., just across the bridge from the historic city of Charleston. The brewery has quickly gained the attention of craft beer drinkers in the southeast.

Omens/Visions: I don’t really follow a set rule with omens but I do use it quite profusely because it is so natural, as a divination technique, you just have to observe and understand. There are general guidelines one can follow but most of the time, it comes from superstitions of the old so user be wary.
But for now, while I'm growing big with baby and need a safer bike, I will ride my $200 steal. Besides, I can jump curbs in this thing. And even though my midwives would probably kill me if they knew I was jumping curbs on a mountain bike, I think a little excitement in your life can go a long way.
This nature walk starts/ends from the Serangoon West Dam to the second bridge of the waterway along the banks of Serangoon Reservoir/Sungei Serangoon. Have a closer look of Coney Island shoreline. From the map, there are shelters and fishing decks along the way. These pictures were taken from the Serangoon East Dam and Lorong Halus Wetland gravel trail.
It has been said over the past few years, that the presence of elevated inflation in the economy can help to reduce the debt burden. One way to do this is monetising debt by using the Bank of England printing presses to boost demand.
Rarely does an island with the attributes of Cave Cay become available. Stunning natural beauty, a protected and private, deep-water harbour and marina with floating cement dock system and 35 dock slips, plus a 2,800 ft. private airstrip make this the perfect private island.
Lastly, I’m not truly surprised that the Tres Bestia were beaten by the captain. Seeing that captain’s face…yeah, I can see that person is strong and that the Tres Bestia may not be able to defeat that person. At least Ichigo arrived.
“…he allowed Satan to test Job to bring glory to himself and to prove Satan wrong.” I’ll get to the Satan part soon, but for now: why would God need to glory himself? He knows he’s going to be right anyway. He’s God. He knows everything past, present, and future, so he knew anyway that Job was going to pass this test, even if Job had the “free will” to pass or fail the test. As I have pointed out before though, the story of Job does not mention Satan at all. The story goes that the “adversary,” which was part of God’s council (on a side note, why does God need a council? He’s God for Christ’s sake!), was the one testing Job. There is no Satan in the Old Testament. Satan was something invented by Christians. If you want, I can put you in contact with a Jewish friend of mine who knows the Torah inside and out. He is the Jewiest Jew that ever Jew’d, and he will tell you that in the Jewish faith, there is no Satan/Devil/Lucifer. If you are going to continue using the argument that Satan is even a character in the Old Testament, when he obviously is not, then it is painfully obvious that you are ignorant of almost anything to do with basic scripture.

Holten Thick and Juicy Black Angus Burgers #5788, these burgers are HUGE and delicious! They are seriously the size of 1 1/2 burgers! I couldn't believe the size and totally worth every penny! I love having pre-made frozen hamburgers for a quick, yummy meal! Just pull them out of the freezer and throw them on the grill (or George Foreman) and dinner's done in 10 minutes, that's the kind of meal I like!
I think that if it had been barreled in bourbon instead, like Jefferson's Reserve, I think I would try this one again. I was excited to try this because it was recommended by a stout loving beer friend. Sorry to disappoint, but this won't make it back to the cooler any time soon.
Clothes, accessories, and material thing are not enough, what stands out about a woman is the true beauty of her eyes. The make-up industry is overly saturated with products, colors, and myths; as a consumer (on a budget), finding the right line can be difficult and at times frustrating.

In a recent interview with Seventeen, Jennifer Lawrence had this to say about being healthy in mind and body:
The prolonged sleep deprivation took a toll. My back was killing me and it became more difficult for me to fight off background anxieties. Even after Alex got to sleep, I'd lay awake in bed, playing worst-case scenarios of all sorts on an endless loop in my head. My waking attitude toward life in general became more dour and cynical.
They really went all out in customizing a pork dish so that Daniel could eat it on his special no-carbs diet. They sauteed the pork slices and place them atop steamed veggies, replacing the usually cabbage in the dish. Silver noodles, rather than rice were provided as a side since they are very low-carb, being made out of mung bean sprouts. Daniel was quite impressed and said that it is better than any Thai food he's tried in Berkeley. It may be tiny (the kitchen and dining room are equal in size), but it packs a punch!
How many concept albums feature a racist AI as a central character in the narrative? Only one, by my count (it is this one). In the process of turning his comic book epic The Amory Wars into a series of records, frontman and guitarist Claudio Sanchez stumbled onto a combination of styles that should never have worked: emo plus prog plus metal. The fact that we've yet to see any imitators that I am aware of indicates no other band has been able to make this unique and unintuitive combination work. Sanchez's distinctive vocals, higher than any man with his build should be able to hit, expressive within the limited emotional range the songs require of him, fight with Sanchez and Travis Stever's guitar work for highlight of the record, though the varied and complex time signatures give both of them a strong fight. If it did nothing but give us "Three Evils (Embodied in Love and Shadow)" it would be a good record; the fact that all of the songs are almost as good makes it a great one.

It is a long, curvy mountain road to get to the different cliff dwellings sites in the park. I was not going to stay for a long time on this visit, so I did not drive through the entire park. I drove to the Visitors Center and walked around that area. Then I drove to Spruce Tree House and the Museum and Spruce Tree Cafe. I walked down the trail to see Spruce Tree House and went down into a Kiva. This Kiva was not very deep, maybe around 7'.

First let me say that I have been annoyed for years with the overly critical reviews on TVs in general. I’ve spent over a year afraid to purchase a TV in the past simply due to details that I learn aren’t even noticeable. My last TV was the Toshiba 55sv670u and I loved every aspect of it. The picture blew me away. It had bad reviews that scared me, still bought it and thought those people were crazy 5 minutes after plugging it in! It died after 2 years and decided to replace it with another “better” TV. My choice after a ton of research was the Toshiba 55ul610u. I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed when comparing it to the quality of my older TV. It’s not a terrible TV, just a little let down since it is newe…

Trick or Treat Bag
At mid-CD I literally felt my heart burst forth with love and inspiration. The deep love that encompasses and views all. And the inspiration that comes from reconnecting to one’s Soul. I felt as if I were viewing the universe through the eyes of Source. The feeling of tangible connection to the spirit of the cosmos and its divine essence is palpable and deepens from track to track. Very uplifting, very inspiring, very heart centered and moving, this CD is a true gem.
Having written this before opening the next page, the immediately subsequent passage rings all the more powerfully, ‘Suppose then that some trait in the image of the philosophers of the future poses the riddle whether they would not perhaps have to be skeptics in the sense suggested last…’ a riddle that N- just walked the careful reader through in the preceding two sections. This dude was clever. ‘With just as much right one would call them critics: and certainly they will be men of experiments.’ We have just finished talking about the distinction between ‘science’ and ‘philosophy’, remembering that the scientists flatter themselves by claiming exclusive domain over ‘experiment’, though I would feel comfortable using that descriptor for the project N- and I just completed and was witnessed here. What was this but a ‘philosophical’ ‘experiment’? ‘they like to employ experiments in a new, perhaps wider, perhaps more dangerous sense…’

The ferry is moored to the pier at Gourock, just next to the train station. A couple of slim ropes hold it to the rusted metal structure of the pier. The rust is partially hidden by a swarm of barnacles, intricate as a crochet pattern. A flimsy metal gangway is placed between the boat and pier. There are thin handrails to hold onto and the walkway has raised ridges on it, useful in bad weather no doubt, when the gangway is wet and slippery with spray. A man stands on either side of it, to bolster your confidence and, I imagine, catch

There was a lot of drama surrounding the engagement and wedding of Shannon Tweed to Kiss legend Gene Simmons, and it all played out on their show, Gene Simmons’ Family Jewels, and online. When Simmons finally proposed to Tweed after, as he called it, 28 years of unwedded bliss, it’s no surprise he dropped to one knee. The weight of the 27 carat diamond probably helped weigh him down.
It’s hard to give up being right. As I said I’m pretty good at it in relationships, but I’m just getting that I’ve been holding a 20 year debate with the Big Guy over this one, a real ball buster and have been holding on by my teeth, my limbs long ago numb then severed from 20 years of non stop tugging. I gotta throw this rope back out to sea cos maybe just maybe the whole world has better things to do that collectively set out to make my life caca. Maybe, just maybe the only one who can make it anything at all is… me.

Has anyone heard of Kent Haruf? I hadn’t until Scott Pack, on his blog, mentioned this novel and what a fine writer Haruf is. I found PLAINSONG and its sequel, EVENTIDE at the library and I’ve just finished reading the latter. My advice is: run, don’t walk to the nearest library to you and see if you can find them there. They are quite marvellous. A combination of Raymond Carver (very plain and unadorned prose) Cormac McCarthy (hard men, farmers, the land, a very small town in Colorado, an amazing landscape etc) and Elizabeth Strout(sensitive portrayal of feelings, emotions, especially of children and women and a build up of the story of a whole community in short chapters). I feel Haruf is my discovery of the year and I will now read everything he’s written. I can’t recommend him strongly enough.

1) I have an issue of Runners World which teaches how to correctly and individually massage certain muscles used in running. I am thinking once or twice a month going strenuously through those might relieve some of that muscle stress and soreness. Most of the methods suggests used household items, making this low/no cost. It certainly isnt anywhere in the galaxy of what I am hoping for, but I probably should make the effort for health’s sake. Removing excessive soreness is a trait of a good runner to me. Right now, I eat foods that help with that, but I feel like tactile release would be more useful.

Week 2 we will cut each piece in fourths, using the fold lines on the back of the painting to follow, and exchange pieces so that each child has 1/4 of his/her own work and 3 pieces from classmates. Using sandwich picks and Glue All, kids will glue their 4 pieces onto another 12" X 12" piece of construction paper, using the sides to match.
FOOD CHANGES: As you vibrate higher, you will find that you no longer want the things that you used to. Coffee, tea and meat are just three of the dietary changes that people make as they begin to vibrate faster. Meat is especially dense and can really affect the body’s energy, especially if it has hormones in it. You may develop cravings for certain foods, or go off your favorite foods. This is normal and a part of the change to the higher vibration. If you find this happening, then let it happen and explore the new possibilities.

After the Anglo-Boer War, and the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, the National Party was formed to promote and develop the spirit and ideology (as they saw it) of the Boer Republics, and in the 1940s that spirit developed into the ideology of apartheid. Thus “Boer” and the Zulu version “iBhunu” came to represent the apartheid ideology and its supporters. And they called themselves “Boere”, no matter how urbanised they might be. And this was what the struggle song referred to — the destruction of the ideology of apartheid and the power of the apartheid regime.
Thank you God for loving me.
I like that the Truvia packets are pretty full. Have you ever used other sweetener packets and maybe 1/3 of the packet is actually the sweetener? Truvia is not like that. I felt like it would be a bit more worth my money than other packets.
It is amazing how something that seems so silly can mean such a big step for someone for whom it was impossible to go out without a “mask”.

By law, except with adults, general protective considerations (such as “making an example”) can play no role.
Pacing is frequently a challenge, particularly for a long manga, but I think this one works despite its length largely because the cast is so diverse and complex (rather than pat standard side characters). Although there is a potential for the shojo standard reverse harem (one girl with many male potential admirers), it's generally more family-like with really only Yuki and Kyo as serious potential love interests. The side stories and complicated emotional histories of the various characters have considerable depth and, frequently, charm. Sometimes, they are downright heart-wrenching and it's somewhat intriguing to me how the author used the silly premise to highlight some key family interactions. Momiji's past (and his Tohru-like acceptance) of a horrific situation was particularly touching for me.
We don’t know why the other hotel we stayed at for 3 nights didn’t ask us for all 4 VISAS but we were surely glad Mr Singh was able to help us. He picked us up within 30 minutes at the hotel! He took us to a Club he belongs to right next to Central Park in Jaipur.
Again, this looked very odd on the hanger and had some *enormous* shoulder pads which are now languishing in the bin. I may take an inch or two off the length but look at those pockets! Perfect for keeping kittens and other such equipment in.
Toby goes to bed around 7:30pm, so Alex and I have the rest of the evening to hang out together. Alex is a great cook, and he’ll make us dinner—like spaghetti Bolognese, or eggs and sausage, or a big salad with tons of toppings—while I finish up work. He listens to music while he cooks, so it always takes a while (since he'll just stand there, drumming on the counter and watching the water boil:). Then when dinner is ready, usually around 9pm, we'll hang out for the next couple hours, and watch a movie or play games or just chat. Also, a couple nights a week, we'll go out to dinner with friends, or we'll invite friends over. We usually go to bed between 11 and midnight. I cherish that grown-up time at the end of the day.

This essay avoids the debilitating ideological “war” between utilitarian education for a job (vocational), and general education for well-rounded citizenship (liberal arts) fueling the crisis mentality that pervades media conversations, blogs, and articles about American higher education. The time has come to focus the scatter-shot, overheated debate about what is “wrong” with college and “the system,” and to bear down instead upon the most intimate arena in which education actually occurs: the classroom.

Dave with Ruby Washington. She is an incredible woman. She was National Mother of the Year in 1993. She had three biological children, four adopted, and over 200 foster children! She is currently opening a home for un-wed mothers. What a remarkable woman. I have loved her since I met her at the 1994 convention. She really liked Dave. =)
Our dogs are part of our lives. They are not our children, and we do not treat them such. Loving and faithful companions is closer to the truth. Innkeeping would simply not be the same without them Or at least some of them.
Good News: I'm kinda sorta getting a promotion at work! They're making me Senior staff (instead of Jr Staff) as one of the senior staff is pregnant. I kind of had a feeling about it, as they were clearly training me to take on more responsibility. I hope I can work hard enough to show them I can do it, I often make stupid mistakes. It makes me wonder if they think I can do it.

I got quiet and let God work in the mother’s heart, and then the Spirit told me to pray for the baby. As I prayed for healing for that precious little one, I realized that God had allowed the physical problems of the baby to reach the mother’s heart. He had touched her with a discipline that was able to break through her rebellion and restore her relationship with God. As I left that room, I suddenly realized that the baby’s name was Isaiah….who, in the Bible, was a prophet, a man of God that revealed God’s heart and mind to the people, who spoke God’s words, calling them to repentance and to a restored relationship with Him; not unlike this tiny Isaiah.

But then I started my weight loss program. The thing with a weight loss program is that your internal motivation only lasts so long. My internal motivation is high for about a month. I'll stick to the plan perfectly and do everything prescribed for that month, but once that month wears off I start to wander. This time around I have a health coach (Jesslyn) that I can talk to, which has led to me jumping back on the wagon after the all-too-normal relapse into my old habits when that first month was finished.
I make friends very easily.I'm sure that some of it is attributed with my view that we are all made of the same star material. Another part is that I am pretty darn charismatic. I can make people suprise smile. Those are those rare smiles that happen when others aren't expecting to flex those fantastic facial muscles. It gives me a great amount of pride to count another person as someone who likes me. For all of my anti-conformist views, I still feel the need to be liked by others.
When Sebelius responded that she did not understand the “nuances” of these tests, she was pressed by Gowdy to explain why she regarded the contraception mandate as constitutionally valid.

Do you know why there are so many planets out in the mysterious Universe and why new planets are being formed? The Universe has 100 billion galaxies, each containing hundreds of millions of stars. Our Creator’s original Divine Plan was for the inhabitants of this planets to multiply to not only fill the earth but other planets! Genesis 1:28 God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it.” If the first pair had passed the test and not eat from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, they would be able to eat from the Tree of Life and live forever. Earth was supposed to be a paradise. This planet is special in many ways – it was the first planet to be inhabited. Mars was inhabited as well. Many planets are also inhabited by intelligent beings but they are NOT involved in this Spiritual War. If they choose to interfere, and some did, they will be dealt with accordingly. Point #1: Inhabitants from other planets are NOT behind the spike in UFO sightings.
A love forever, endless and true.

Next I tried mini cheese popovers. I had never heard of popovers before, but saw this recipe on Shutterbean, and have been keen to give it a go. These were super easy and turned out really well! Our oven cooked them much quicker than I expected, so they got a little burnt. They taste best fresh out of the oven, and I may have eaten too many. Like five. In a row. Just saying.
God does not promise that we won't experience heartache. But he does reassure us that they are light, and momentary, and that they are achieving us a greater glory. How neat is that to be able to hold on to. Through the heartache, I am clinging to what is unseen and eternal. Holding on to the Majestic Creator and trusting that one day I will see my grandma soon, and that maybe her story, will help someone else.We don't know when and we don't know how, but I trust in God and I know that is all we need.

I was at the Squal*Mart the other day and the lady checking me out was unusually surly. I know they are usually surly but she was even more surly than normal. She was griping and kvetching about the fact there were 56 bazillion people in line and only 4 check stands open. I looked around and asked “So you’re having a pretty bad day, uh?” She glared at me and replied “Yeah.” I leaned over to sign my credit authorization and said “maybe you should just quit. I mean you seem really unhappy. Maybe the best thing for you to do is just quit.” She sucked in air and then spit out “but I NEED this job.” I smiled and replied “then maybe you should just be happy you have a job and not kvetch about how bad it is.” Needless to say I don’t think I improved her mood.

Iceland, an isolated island perched in the North Atlantic above the Arctic Circle is home to a mere 290,000 individuals who strive to survive yet another blistering cold winter. Through the deafening icy blast of air that constantly surrounds and engulfs this mysteriously beautiful country, a tone begins to emerge out from the geysers and blizzards. At first glance, one might think that the winds are beginning to sing of their celestially arctic sorrows. One’s ear begins to tingle, not with the sting of arctic breath, but from the vibration of sounds not heard before. It is at that moment when the beloved listener begins to believe that he or she is dreaming that they realize it is not the enchanting atmosphere of this transcendental piece of land that is resounding in their ears, but that of certain natives singing out into the night.

I kept on drinking to drown the pain but at the same time I kept pleading with God for my wife to return My mind was warped because I believed I was an christian but yet I didn’t want to follow his commands and kept on getting drunk every waking moment the drinking habit actually caused me my Job, by the Grace of God, I got my good paying job back after a week went by I went to pick up my last check and my ex boss said what is wrong you’re one of my best workers and now you’re a mess, So I broke down and told him, I am thankful I did because I received the help I needed as well the encouragement to get away from the liquor… after I cleaned up my act I got my job back… by now close to 2 months went by since she left but I still plead with God, for her return…

If someone has an identity as a Catholic because they went to a Catholic School, used to go to Mass, prefer fish on Fridays, drink Guinness or they support Glasgow Celtic (I've seen it all) but they don't go to Mass, then why look to them as to what being Catholic means? Listening to some rent-a-bores telling us how repressed they are because of their Catholic upbringing makes about as much sense as someone with a gym membeship they never use complaining that they're overweight.

Not only are there standards for woman’s quality of life inside the home, but these also extend to public places. Establishments such as banks, grocery stores and post offices have special lines in which women who are pregnant or have small children are priority patrons, along-side the elderly and disabled. It’s the LAW. In other words, Brazil is an absolute, unpublicized, utopia for career-mothers-wives. In Brazil, YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE IT ALL.

As 1906 dawned Buddy Bolden was the king of New Orleans black music. It was a perilous position, however, constantly threatened by those who were picking up on his ideas and doing other things with them. Bolden took on more and more jobs to keep ahead o his competitors and he tried to get deeper into the music, realizing that the style his band had developed in 1900 was no longer new. This was a music that would keep changing; its audience would be fickle.

We can all understand that this conversation between the professor and the student seems intended for encouragement and motivation for Christians, or even people seeking truth. In doing all of this, I don’t want to tear it apart and say that the original conversation is a waste of time for people to read. It can be as enjoyable for someone to read as it is for someone to enjoy a political cartoon that completely trashes a certain politician or country or law. I understand that, but I felt motivated to try to speak as much truth into what I felt was relevant to the conversation as I could. If anything, this can maybe motivate an individual or two to dive deeper into the rabbit’s hole and seek what they are looking for.

Plastic wrap suffocates the living cheese, trapping in its exhalate (gas and moisture just like breath and sweat) thereby encouraging bacteria growth on your precious bundles of joy. Plastic wrap then traps the off-odors that cheese produce naturally (like ammonia) from being dissipated. It doesn't take too much imagination to see where the term "cutting the cheese" comes from when you unwrap a nice cheese after a couple of days in plastic. Let's put it plainly: BO and bad breath do not a fine cheese make.

Locking people up and forgetting about them will not, in my opinion, remove society's problems. It will merely exacerbate them. Reform and genuine engagement and care are what cause change.

cross-currents of pre-1920s Modernist movements – its collage of disparate perspectives and registers seeming to point towards the Cubist principles of Braque and Picasso, its enthusiastic embrace of urban multiplicity holding parallels with Futurism and Vorticism – and also astonishingly prescient of later open-form poetries, particularly the kinds of “process-poems” which attempt to plot unstable ontologies across both a timed duration and the

This is Volume III in Bruhn’s “Wooden Ships and Iron Men” series of books on Navy coastal minesweeping operations beginning in 1941. The two previous volumes focused on World War II and the Korean War. In this volume Bruhn, who served in the Navy from 1977-2001, looks at the work done by two dozen Navy coastal minesweepers from 1953-76. In addition to ferreting out mines and performing other operations in Vietnam, the ships’ crews also searched for downed aircraft, sunken ships, and lost munitions off the U.S. coasts, in the Caribbean, and throughout Asia.

Recognising and differentiating a genuine offer from an influence strategy is only the first step. Resisting influence tactics is very difficult. The rule of reciprocation, for example, will make you feel guilty if you don't respond. Understanding the sincerity of the sentiment can help you to override intuitive reaction. A skilful marketeer can dress weapons of influence such that they appear genuine.

I have no idea how the muffins turn out - they are still baking - but I'm praying they are good, or at least tolerable, because the recipe makes 2 dozen muffins!

If the mistake is truly that, a mistake or just a moment of not thinking about our actions or words, a moment of weakness (which we all have, it’s human nature), or even despair when we act out of frustration and weariness, then apologize, do what is needed to correct the issue and make the situation right with the other person. Then move on in peace, calm, kindness and love. Allow yourself to feel the positive for them and yourself. Now, let it go.
Over the last maybe 2 or 3 weeks, Sheba's been developing a bald spot on her right side, toward her back leg. We didn't think anything of it at first -- maybe she was just losing her winter coat especially fast in that area or something -- but as time's gone by and it's gotten worse, we're starting to wonder what's going on.
BREAKING NEWS: The above mentioned have just added their profiles to Match.com
If you don’t know Eloise, she is a six-year girl who lives at the Plaza Hotel. Or did. The 1955 book by Kay Thompson, with perfect illustrations by Hilary Knight, is said to have been suggested by the childhood of Liza Minelli, who was the god-daughter of the author. These are just details though. Eloise is really a rawther busy little girl whose days fill up with tiny adventures accompanied by Weenie (her pug) and Skipperdee (her turtle.) And when Eloise does not want to do something, Eloise cannot be budged in her opinion. I seem to remember that Nanny had an awful time getting Eloise in the bawth.

I am intrigued by the news of the lady who gave a kidney to save her boss and then was fired by that same boss. I tweeted, “No, I don’t want the job, but I’ll take my kidney back” along with the link to that article. Hope it entertains. I’ll tell you what that kind of news story DOES do, it reinforces a rather nasty commentary on humanity, that’s what it does. But I would be the first to admit that I would be vastly amused were this woman to sue to get her kidney back. Now THAT would be a news story. Heck, that would be an awesome story. I think I’ll write it down.
For a long time, I knew that I felt strongly this way, but I have always also understood while those who are from this area and have gone to school at UND have taken so much pride into the name. UND is not a school of many traditions so when something like a powerful name/logo comes alone, we hold on tightly.

This does not underplay the enormity and fear of HIV (which is immense) but rather shows just the level of fear, taboo and stigma around cancer and the challenges in accessing good standards of information, treatment and care.

Now for some fun reading. As you already know, this Hard Rock Cafe tasting was going to involve the company of a person who shot my HRC glassware collection. As a matter of happy co-incidence, it was Salonee Gadgil of bellyfirst.
Something else I would recommend to people trying to lose weight is finding something to be passionate about that is health related, you know, like bicycles! I think that my obsession... er I mean addiction... um still not right.. hobby, yes that's it Hobby, is a huge factor in keeping me interested in healthy living because its kind of hard to blast down a rail trail when you weigh 400 pounds. Bicycles have become very interesting to me once again, more so than when I was 10 years old riding around on my Huffy Santa fe' or when I was 14 with my Schwinn Super le tour, there is something about them that just speaks to me, I like riding them, I like fixing up the old broken ones and I have too many right now! The spring can't get here soon enough so that I can get my weekend rides back on the menu and I am planning on being back down to my fighting weight by then so I have a lot to look forward to with the spring coming around again.

In my case, they removed all the swearing and a lot of the biological detail. Jokes were shortened. (Three variations on a comic riff would be cut back to one, so there was no sense of a riff at all).
Although it is in north eastern France, Alsace enjoys a very sunny climate that typically produces ripe, rich and very approachable wines while the varietal labeling makes them relatively straightforward to understand. It’s just that right now these are not the varietals that most consumers think they want to drink.
To his credit, Wright doesn't allow his consistently, deliriously inventive style—fights shot like video-game/Japanese anime mash-ups; edits that collapse space and time; even a seemingly unremarkable sequence that plays like a sitcom scene, complete with laugh track and Seinfeld bumper-music cue—to completely obscure a palpable strain of regret that suffuses parts of the film. For all its pop-art multimedia spectacle, Scott Pilgrim, at its most visually unhinged, remains grounded in Wright's affection for both the media-savvy visual tropes and for his characters.

Perhaps these three clumsy figures could be seen to symbolise 1950s Britain: shocked, unbalanced and squirming on its back. The artists reject the ideal for the real, seeking to portray the human condition honestly in all its horrible, nauseating, tedious, embarrassing grittiness. This is Art, bloated and bleary-eyed at 6 a.m. with a hangover and no makeup on.

The Monday Night Seminar series is an ongoing event offered by the Faculty of Information McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto running until Winter/Spring 2013. It invites intellectuals, (re)searchers, artists, practitioners and cultural activists to convene and engage in intellectual dialogues from edgy seminars to intense conversations, to imagine how we can exploit our familiarity with digital media and harness the technologies of change to unleash a vibrant future for profound, discontinuous, soul-redefining encounters.

I've been working my rear end off all summer with no A/C (but like I said in an earlier post, I'm not complaining because I'm just glad I was able to work in my room) decorating and organizing. And I finally got pretty much finished today. (I say pretty much because I have a few things I just can't do until I have my kids names and until I get my Promethean Board!)
If you are new to this series I would highly recommend that you read the novella The Warlord Wants Forever before reading A Hunger Like No Other. It will help introduce you into the world and to Valkyrie convent that the heroine grew up in. Also the couple that is in the novella shows up in Hunger and I was glad that I knew their back story.

Yeah. That didn't happen. They had two different sizes of cupcakes; I chose the bigger one because the bow on it was prettier. It cost 2.5 pounds, which is still cheaper than anywhere else. The bow was made of fondant and it was a lemon cupcake, the first I've ever head. I can't say it was good, but it definitely tasted better than all of the overly sweet cupcakes and cakes everywhere else.
We went to the Seacoast Eat Local farmers' market in Exeter today - for the first time, we decided to go toward the middle of the market (which runs from 10-2) instead of toward the beginning. Made for a nice, peaceful trip through the aisles, since the crowds had diminished - and indeed, as promised, there were still plenty of goodies left when we arrived!

Cooked a chicken and bok choy stir fry over brown rice with homemade sauce. It was my first time cooking bok choy. It was only 99 cents at the organic market so I figured why not. I will definitely be buying it again and trying out new ways to cook it. How can you pass up an organic veggie for 99 cents??

Though the schools rarely compete in any sport, a rivalry exists between the University of Georgia in Athens and the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Both great schools stake claim to being the nation’s oldest state chartered public university. The fact remains that way back in 1785 Ol’ Georgia chartered first. Carolina opened her doors early, but the public state college system was invented around the University of Georgia.

This is Jeff and I and the Fourth of July parade in Torrey. We go every year. This parade is so awesome, that they go down both sides of the street.You have to love small towns. It made me think of the good old days at the Wasatch County parade in Heber. Parades are good, only when they go down both sides of the street. Jeff made his annual march with the Wieners of Wayne County... at least long enough to get a good picture. People in Wayne Co. must really love thier weiner dogs. The dogs are behind him on a float, which you can't see.
Here on the island we also rely on home delivery, by either Schwans (love it!) or amazon grocery, etc. You can find great deals if you are willing and able to buy in bulk, and buying in bulk is a really good idea when you’re on an island. It is a practice that I will continue when and if we ever move mainland. Coupons are also a huge help, which most of you already know. The coupon craze is more than just a fad and I don’t know any budget-conscience mom who doesn’t clip and save. To be sure I have no advice to share that hasn’t already been shared. But in case you are not a Harris Teeter shopper, if you live near one this is the best place to redeem your coupons. They double coupons everyday (up to 99 cent) and on a quarterly basis (sometimes more often) they have triple coupon days. They also do super double days which double coupons up to $1.99. The closest Harris Teeter to me is about 85 or 90 miles, but it is worth it to make the trip if I have enough coupons and a long enough list.
“very engaging and the explosive finale provides a final round knockout”
That was in Communist Poland and it was the same routine throughout the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc on May Day. Communist leaders gave bold and loud speeches to no end praising the workers for their sacrifices for the State and the general welfare of the people. People lauded over them and some stood awe struck as they spoke their words of honey laced with poison. Problem was, as Joanna pointed out, all that talk of sacrificing for a better life DID NOT apply to the common man or woman in the USSR! It only applied to the elites in the Kremlin and the Communist Party. The people suffered in squalor while the elites in the Kremlin dined endlessly on champagne and caviar sneering at the common folk, mocking them, and laughing at them and how stupid they were. And you don’t think the elites today are not doing the same thing? Think again. They are laughing at YOU and mocking YOUR own stupidity!

This account of the meals we had in Japan doesn't do justice to Japanese cooking and celebration of food - the reverence and care that is taken over the preparation and serving, the presentation and pride they take in each morsel, each small dish of sauce or side-dish, is truly amazing.
Hercules loved to go to canoing, although a romp on the shore was never far from his mind. He accompanied Thomas and I on many fishing trips, and never failed to make us laugh at his reaction when we hauled in a pike or bass. Together, he and I explored many waterways and wetlands.

The real problem with Medicaid is that it is being overwhelmed by an economy that generates poverty as rabbits generate more rabbits. Today, more than 60 million Americans receive Medicaid, and many economists and sociologists argue that the United States' antiquated definition of poverty keeps as many as 30-60 million more from Medicaid eligibility.
A dictionary from 1830 also mentions that “certain beers are also commonly called ‘oil’ (ale): Englisch Öl, Rostocker Öl.”

The ground’s getting wetter underfoot, and, looking ahead, I see a herd of 30-40 deer in the distance, about 150 metres away. Roe again, but with darker coats than the smaller group I was entranced by earlier. Edging carefully forwards, they quickly become aware of my presence – there is little cover, with the exception of a few rather magnificent veteran oak trees. Heads lift, one by one, interrupted from their grazing, until the entire herd is staring my way. I halt. We remain gazing at each other intently, neither sure of the other’s next move. A few decide my presence is too unsettling and begin to edge forwards across my path, left to right, until the entire group is walking nervously, stiff necked and alert, then running across the bog. They continue along the edge of one of the many ditches, until making a sudden 90 degree turn away from me and melting away into the rain.
For them to have to do so under the auspices of blatantly biased mediator Thabo Mbeki adds to the injustice.
Una’s own game- Unicorn Justice Fighter/Unicorn Robber Baron is a fast-paced action game with political undertones. Says Lee “Set in a dying galaxy with rapidly dwindling resources, you play a unicorn being threatened with extinction. Using your brightly coloured droppings, you fight off evil horses who want to destroy the awesomeness you bring into the universe. Your actions and decisions determine whether you are a unicorn justice fighter or a unicorn robber baron.” Though the game is a lot of fun to play- it also carries a political message which can be read in multiple ways — as a simulation of the mechanics of oppression and political power, as a commentary on competition and communalism in capitalist economies or an exploration of the interplay between dynamics of Otherness and exceptionalism.
Why cant I just chill and enjoy it?
But here's the real kicker. Mr. Irani can certainly survive quite well on that salary. He might have to make some conservative adjustments here and there. He might have to save up for 7 or 8 years before he can afford to buy his yacht. I have no idea what his living arrangements are but it might be rough if he wants a 10,000 square foot home in Los Angeles, even in Compton (if there is such a thing as a home that large in Compton). Maybe he'd have to settle for 4,000 square feet. Hey, life's tough and we have to manage it.
Thus, when you attack Bain Capital, this great Bird Of Prey of the Romneylan Empire, they simply throw up their deflector shields and ward off your phaser attack. That's because you are engaging in a frontal assault against their strongest, most easily defensible positions.

In yet another of my Small Table Game Days, number 2 this time, I played some 15 point fast and furious Warmachine with my girl. Sadly we didn’t take pics of the game, solely because there were some unpainted models. Still, I got a few of the table and the figures at one time.
Step one is the 3D modelling. We wanted a steampunk look and feel for the blimp, in keeping with the game. Thomas had a photo of a 19th century submersible (on display at the Barcelona Maritime Museum) that fit the bill nicely so I used that as a reference to build the elements in Modo.

When the investment of the teacher and the mental disengagement of the student are at odds, my going-around-in-circles with the dilemma is compounded by reluctance to downgrade my status at the front of the room, which is, after all, where I belong. Each disciplinary comment I put out there is one more incremental departure from the reasons we are supposed to be in the room.
Why is this more serious? Because, if nothing else, it puts the victim in danger. It is also a crime: under British law, rape complainants are awarded automatic and life-long anonymity. The penalty for naming a complainant is £5,000 (kind of low, IMO, but that’s not the discussion here).
As a result, I’ve been on a mini-fast since Tuesday, eating very lightly, mostly liquids and mostly alkaline. As I’ve moved through this week of incredible outward chaos, I find myself pulling inside and anchoring to the Earth and my own connection to Spirit. It feels good, and the tongue issue has me craving more silence and simplicity in all areas. I walked a labyrinth yesterday with my friend Rainbow and her daughter Iris, and we talked about the increased sense of the “real” world as a dream. Fighter jets from the WI National Guard flew above us every few minutes, punctuating the peaceful spirit of our time together with such unbelievably loud Mars energy that even the little Aries, Iris, started screaming. Rainbow and I calmed her down by pointing to the whispering tall grasses and the special labyrinth path. The pre-Spring woods surrounding us seemed to sparkle with activity, almost as though the faeries, normally so shy of loud noises, were staking their claim on this world anyway. “No more war!” they seemed to say, and we agreed.
On the bright side, I am completely anti-depressant free and for the most part, I'm feeling great! I do have some emotional times, but I'm learning better ways of dealing with them (which includes allowing myself to feel the emotions sometimes)....and prescription meds will be a last resort from now on.
Good Morning Everyone, well I do hope that you had a lovely bank holiday weekend, mine was a busy one, hubby went and did his volunteer job with the local steam railway on Saturday and then on Sunday we did our monthly shop, not exactly exciting but at least a necessary job. Anyway this weeks Challenge for The Paper Shelter is "Anything Goes" I know how much us crafters enjoy this challenge and Im sure there will lots of entrants for it, and of course as always we are being sponsered by Veronica and Pedro from The Paper Shelter and they are offering a fabulous prize.
Ooooh! Aaaahh! Actually, this one made me take a step back and say, "Good job, self! Nice work!" Yes, I do talk to myself like that. Most of the time I have nice things to say to myself :D

My grandmother is an example of someone who was left unable to talk and walk well after a large left MCA stroke. It has been a long road of recovery. She will never be fully able to speak again or move well on her own, but, she IS living on her own again (with help from my mom and her friends!). She is still an amazing person, and she is still the same person even if she can’t express it. You can just tell, the way she may roll her eyes at something you say or just shakes her head, or the way her voice gets really excited when you are able to piece together what she is trying to say.

This particular Psalm was written by David after Nathan, a prophet, had come and confronted him about his hidden sin. David, having been given much wisdom and understanding of God, recognized that in order to restore right relationship with the Redeemer, it required repentance and redirection, not sacrifice nor offerings.

The Old Testament is also called the Tanakh or written Torah or the Hebrew bible since it is written/remembered in Hebrew which was/is the language of the Jews. Parts of the bible are in an old middle-eastern language called called Aramaic. (Not the Ethiopian Ahramic.) Religious jews believe that the old testament was given to Moses by God on a mountain called Mt. Sinai. Some orthodox Christians believe that Mt. Sinai is in Egypt but there are alternate locations proposed also.

Two things struck me that I will share with you. It is slightly unnerving, and at he same time oddly warming, to have the ordinary cricket fan (and some are very ordinary) look at you through squinted eyes from the other side of the glass wondering what sort of ‘suits’ are in there living it up large with the rich and famous. My eyes met one bloke who turned his nose slightly as if to say; ‘Cricket snobs’ and I returned a look that said; ‘Mate, I’m normally out there with you and I feel just a little like I’m a ‘cricket class traitor’, but, hey, free beer is free beer, so, you know, one-nil, mate.’

This committee works year round in offices in Switzerland. It determines who is invited to the annual meeting and what policies and plans will be discussed. Every proposal or plan that has ever been discussed at an annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group has come to pass usually within one or two years following the meeting. The Bilderberg Group is directing the "quiet war" that is being waged against us. How can they do it? These are the men who REALLY rule the world. The numbers 3,7,9,11,13,39 and any multiple of these numbers have special meaning to the Illuminati. Notice that the Bilderberg Group has a core of 39 members who are broken into 3 groups of 13 members in each group. Notice that the core of 39 answers to the 13 who make up the Policy Committee.

If ever you hear tell,
Corporate globalization is a stronger phenomenon than in the past, but is not new — Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels discussed globalization in the Communist Manifesto, written in 1848. That was a year of revolts in multiple European countries and empires. Those revolts ultimately failed, ushering in a period of reaction and strengthened monarchies. Despite the immediate failure of 1848, the uprisings did have long-term effects, most importantly the rise of working class organizations to combat the power of capitalist states, a necessity more forcefully administered after the bloody crushing of the Paris Commune in 1871.

They had not visited the site for decades and had no idea where the graves were but thankfully the staff at the cemetery were able to quickly tell us roughly where the graves were located. It was still not the easiest thing in the world though to find the graves. Although every grave plot is numbered the number is only displayed in a headstone and not all headstones have a visible number. A lot of graves are not marked by any headstone including that of Roderick's. Luckily the grave next to Roderick's was numbered so we could find were he was. In the photo below he is (probably!) under on the right.

A young couple moved into our apartment building today. I haven't seen them yet, but I have been hearing them since I returned from the hospital. They just noisily saw friends off who noisily arrived an hour ago, and yelled "Thanks for the champagne!" From this I infer that they are at the beginning of their life together, and I wonder what it will hold. Will one of them develop Alzheimer's after twenty happy years, and the other be where I am now? I'd like to think that in twenty years this disease will be cured or rarely contracted like small pox and bubonic plague. It deserves to be obsolete. But statistically, it is gaining in the polls and becoming epidemic, just when our national healthcare system is at its sickest. What manner of deity indeed?

Today it is NOT raining. If you’re in the UK at the moment you’ll know that for once, just for today, this is a very good thing. We’re going through a drought, there are hose-pipe bans in large areas of the country and it’s been pouring. Bucketing down. Raining cats and dogs. So much rain has fallen on us that it’s been nicknamed the wettest drought on record.

So, what qualifies as mindless hockey knitting? Last year, during the Stanley Cup Playoffs, I made hats. Hats are definitely mindless knitting. The year before, I made socks. For the most part socks are pretty mindless. But this season my hockey knitting has been a lace shawl. Most knitters wouldn’t consider lace to be mindless knitting, but mindless is in the eye of the beholder, and some lace patterns are simple and repetitive and thus qualify as mindless.

America today seems a far cry from the stumps of the past. There are no more spontaneous traveling preachers, revival tent brim stoners, naked running Shakers, or barrel chested men projecting off the backs of trains. Now someone like Joel Olsteen speaks to 16,000 seats and 100 million viewers every Sunday (parishioners onsite can venture into the lobby Starbucks if they get sleepy). Now, we watch Hillary Clinton on television, debating whether her tears are in fact “sincere.” We listen to voices as they rise up, as they articulate and change, as they fade into a whimper. Most voices in our culture do not have the benefit of being destroyed. Neutered and stripped of relevance would be a better description – mostly on television, mostly in moments of high production and spectacle.

Before too long the sun had pulled this particular day to a close, and Jack was walking by with his usual, ‘evening ma’am’. After I locked the cafe door behind me half-an-hour later, I suddenly knew just what I wanted ... actually no, what I needed to do. At the bottom of the cafe stairs instead of turning right towards home and my front door, I turned left and headed for the trees.
As I shared this experience with friends and family, one friend wrote back and said: “At my swearing-in, the judge said… ‘Even if the lady next door isn’t as welcoming as the Statue of Liberty, this process is built on welcoming each of you to your new home country. As this becomes your new country, remember your old home country with love, and remember to make this new home a better place. My grandfather came here as a construction worker, and here I am a federal judge. This is what this country is about.’ I was pretty psyched. I hope your swearing-in was special too.”
The Nestling Sparrow has been waking up at night, between 3 and 5 in the morning, and wanting us to get up and play. He awakens with various shouts, usually at the top of his lungs, like "Hi! I Bambi deer!" (His favorite movie at the moment is "Bambi") "Mommy, I Bambi deer! Mommy, wake up!"
“We could share clothes!”
Word by word, I am closer to finishing the first half of my MFA. They’re hesitant now, but gradually, as deadlines loom, they will flow more freely and I will print piles of papers and allow summer to descend most fully upon me. As always, we are just about between things. For now, for today, my Bearded Co-Cat Finder is sick, home early from work, sleeping off a sore-throat across the room while my keys chatter and I drink tea after tea after tea and allow the first breaths of summer to wash over me here at this table on the fourth floor where I can see rooftops and leaves and flight paths in the blue sky above. We will live like this, in the grip of wonderfully boring domesticity for just a short time longer, at least for now, and then we will have separate summers. I will sit by this window, Jake will sit by that window, and with 262 miles between us, think of all the cats.
As a raw vegan chef, author and teacher, I’m often asked, “Is it necessary to take supplements if I’m on a balanced, organic raw food diet?” I used to assume not, based on the idea that a raw diet is the food that humans evolved to eat. Well, it turns out I was wrong. No matter how well you eat, I think it is essential to supplement.

Blue Dot, of which I managed to taste about four ounces before all extant bottles vanished from the face of the earth, debuted last year to the usual commercial pandemonium. This year, brewer Alan Sprints offered up more of the precious liquid bullion at a dock sail, and I think he was getting six hundred dollars a case. (Kidding.) I managed to score a few precious bottles from Belmont Station, though I have no confidence they have any left. You could stop by and have a look--who knows? It might be interesting just to see what they would charge you.

The difference between this year and years before is that I have required Eli and Brynne to read each of their books themselves instead of me reading them to them! She has read 22 books so far. Her goal is to read 60 books by the end of the summer. There's no doubt she can do it.
There seems to be a pattern developing around food-themed holidays over here. First, there was the last minute Valentine’s Day treat, now Cinco de Mayo. I wasn’t going to do anything special, but then seeing all the great inspiration around the blogosphere, I suddenly had a menu so long that I needed to cut some things out. I thought about ditching these cupcakes in place of a more traditional Mexican dessert like Flan since we’d be drinking margaritas, too, but I’m glad I didn’t. These were fun to make and even more fun to eat.

It was a good year, but I'm ready to move on to 2012!
My dream to be a writer is secret from most people outside my family. A few months ago I told a friend on my degree course that it was what I wanted and she got very brisk with me, saying that some people would kill for the change to get a degree, and that if it wasn't what I really wanted, then I was robbing someone else of a place. That hurt. In my head I'm only trying to be realistic, and account for the fact that the highly subjective world of writing might not open it's doors to me.
In my medical practice, I’ve developed enormous respect for the art of relationships, what makes them work or fail. In all successful relationships, whether with family, friends, or co-workers it’s vital that each person honestly examine his or her behavior and be willing to discuss it and change.
So you can imagine my to do list is quite long.
In modern usage, a 'Luddite' is one overwhelmed by the new, by the modern, by the ever-changing, who seeks refuge in the tried and true, who reveres the test of time, who dwells in that fascinating land known as the past, or even, the 'passed'.
But the main character is the pub itself - just a pub, and so much more, like all pubs are. When you see what it's been through, the survival of the George makes a mockery of anyone who says pubs are dying out.
So this actually isn't where the rug will stay. I'm planning to put it in the new playroom at the new house. But I just had to unroll it and check it out. So gorgeous, beautiful colors. I highly recommend the over dyed rugs at RugsUSA for sure! They're all one of a kind :)
The mounds of laundry overflowing from the utility room into the hallway never seem to understand that the mood to write has no set schedule. And one can ignore the piling dishes in the sink for only so long. I admit, though, I have really come far in that department – selective vision, it is called.
The store got such a great response in the first month that they've added on already, taking the space next door as well.

A person with Social Anxiety Disorder, when faced with talking to people or in front of a group, will often experience greater distress in the form of fight or flight responses. They will experience a great amount of fear, heart racing, sweating, inability to focus, feeling ill, and very possibly having a panic attack. (Panic attacks make you feel like you’re dying and are not fun.) They will avoid social interactions because of their symptoms. Their symptoms impair their social functioning to the point where they can’t really socially function. Which is a problem because, if you haven’t noticed, people are everywhere. This isn’t something they can control or suppress, either. It just happens as a reaction they can’t help, in the same way that you would automatically feel scared in any situation where someone pointed a gun at you.
Lots of stuff to unpack there historically. But politically, my immediate reaction: I can’t imagine that even if any and all “general strike” legislation were instantly repealed, much of American organized labor as we know it would be out on strike today. More to my point, I can’t imagine Graeber thinks so either.
But it didn’t mention adding any liquid so I just added milk. I have no idea how much, and it probably wasn’t enough because the batter was very thick.

No, seriously…it wasn’t that bad. I was trying to figure out if I would’ve been more freaked out if he hadn’t gotten on the plane. But the fact that he did get on the plane…was that a good thing? Fuck if I knew! So I sat back and tried to watch Holmes Inspection on HGTV without too much overreaction going on in my head. It helped that the chick behind me kept putting her foot up on my arm rest as if it belonged to her as part of her seat. “Um, that’s my arm rest. Put your foot down, please.” I bumped into her 2 more times throughout the flight, and if she’d done it again, I was gonna turn around and tell her, “Look, this is MY area I paid to sit in, and that is YOURS. If you wanna use some of mine, its fine, but you’re gonna have to give me $35, ok?” Jeezy chreezy on a stick, what is WRONG with people???

The plans, which supporters say will turn the park into a major metropolitan sporting hub, appear set to face another attack later this month, when they go before a full council meeting.
Awards aren't just for authors. They exist to recognise all sorts of excellence, and encourage more young readers, and the adult gate-keepers who guide them, to learn about more books. Queen of Teen is part of that process. It’d just be nice if they could step away from the pink and towards the Orange.

The Anchorage Museum has a collection of over two-hundred Yup'ik masks that were created during the early 19th and 20th centuries.
It seemed daunting at first, but over the course of several weeks, I laid hands on 0ver 840 items in the collection and I was able to do a comprehensive physical assessment while I collected statistics. I learned a lot about the fast-paced ebb and flow of a teen collection by looking so closely at these items and their circulation patterns, especially for long-running series like Naruto.
Because for most people I know, owning a house will no doubt remain a fantasy. It’s something that’s become clear over the past few years – that those of us who live in cities, whose jobs are not secure, who are flitting from call centre to job centre and back again throughout our 20s and 30s, whose parents don’t have property portfolios, those of us who are single, or still trying to do art or music or something they dreamed of, are unlikely to be able to afford the deposit for a flat. Ever. Which would be fine – especially fine when the bath fills with soupy, rust-coloured water, or the smell from the downstairs chicken shop actually stops you in your tracks when you walk through the door even though they promise their filter system meets legal standards – if only renting wasn’t significantly more expensive (on average 16%) than buying.

She had quite the audience! :) We're so happy she has so many people around her that love her and that were so generous on her birthday.
When the aero rules changed significantly for 2009, most teams adopted fairly conventional approaches in the chassis design to accommodate the changes. One of the major aero changes was the switch to a much smaller rear placed diffuser, The loss in potential downforce from the smaller diffuser, made the rear wing performance a greater contributor to the cars total downforce.

In Spanish, the people and language are called Tigua (pronounced Tiwa). The tribe’s origins are traced back to a formerly Southern Tiwa-speaking people who were displaced from New Mexico in 1680 and 1681 during the Pueblo Revolt against the Spaniards. The Southern Tiwa language is a Kiowa–Tanoan language spoken at Sandia Pueblo and Isleta Pueblo in New Mexico and Ysleta del Sur in Texas. As these Tiwa-speaking people were relocated from New Mexico to Texas, they assimilated with the Spanish and as a result their language almost died out. Today, members of the tribe have worked hard to restore their native language.
Frankly, there are three reasons why Patti Page has not been given all the credit she's due. First, is "How Much is That Doggie In the Window." As much money and fame as it's brought her, it's also irritated critics and unfairly labeled her as just a mainstream-novelty performer. (PS, for years, she sang a PETA-type new version of the song, telling people to adopt not buy!) Second, she's middle-America, and the critics working for influential newspapers in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles have never been kind to "people's choice" performers..even national treasures such as Carol Burnett or Red Skelton, or unpretentious writers such as John Steinbeck. Third, too often her record label or her producers were off the mark with what they gave her and how it was arranged. After her cool years at Mercury she moved to Columbia. Imagine if Mitch Miller had produced Simon & Garfunkel or Dylan at Columbia! Way too many of Patti's Columbia albums were ghastly-produced to the point of gassy middle-aged back-up singers and saccharine arrangements. From there, she drifted comfortably into country-pop, which was the only place for any woman of her age to get any work at all.

As well as these thoughts, I felt an enormous amount of guilt. Guilt that my NEED to find my birth mother and find some answers was causing emotional pain for my adoptive mother and father.

Giving birth does not make you a mother, you have to earn that title/status.

Then I was due to go for a walk with my lovely friend, while my youngest was at nursery, but the weather was ridiculous so we decided to go for a coffee. I found that I was feeling very virtuous as I still had the post exercise endorphins racing around my body, so I had a large green tea with herbal infusions, and it was really massive!! I also had a ham salad with seeds sprinkled on top and a balsamic vinegar/olive oil dressing. It was only 11.30, but I felt hungry! Rather eat something healthy when I am hungry than wait until ‘lunchtime’ and eat cake in desperation.

You cook a whole bunch of parings in water for about half an hour and then leave it in the pot to stay there over night.

I really had no idea what to expect when I went to see where my Dad was now living. He just kept telling me that he looked at the place one day, bought it the next and wasn't planning on coming back for a few months. So when I asked about the house he'd say, I don't know or I don't remember. He's been down in Punta Gorda for a few months now and living in the house, but he still was mum about it's condition. He did tell me the place was pink. I thought it was going to be as pink as this flower, I found on his back patio, but actually it's a dusty rose that pretty much looks like a rosy tan.
I did a bit of research online trying to learn about how to successfully feed babies with cleft palates their solids and got a few good suggestions - one was that it is better for them often if the solids are not so watery, that way they can control it better in their mouths and swallow it instead of it going everywhere. (As an interesting side note, other people suggested making the food MORE watery so that if it goes out the nose, it is not as likely to get stuck and will not cause discomfort - and while that may work for other cleft palate babies, it didn't work so well with Maddy). Another suggestion was instead of feeding her in a sitting position, to feed her at a bit of a recline so that gravity helped the food to go to the back of the mouth where it could be swallowed. Both of these tips seemed to help Maddy a little, but we were still struggling.

Once all sides are browned well, remove tofu from pan and set aside until later.

What should I get for Mom? I just need one more little gift for my brother. A gift for the boss. At the surface, it may seem commercial and perhaps it's your least favorite part of the holidays. But thinking about everyone but yourself for a week or two can't be a bad thing. Not a bad thing at all.

After I was finally done decorating the cupcakes, I still had a batch of goopy, runny, lumpy strawberry cream cheese frosting, unused and sitting in my fridge. I didn't want to throw it out - what could I turn this into? And then I remembered a recipe for Japanese-style cheesecake that I've been meaning to try out. I quickly checked the recipe - it called for cream cheese. Check. It also called for sugar and butter. Check, and check - all of those were already in the frosting. All I needed to add was flour, cornstarch, salt, and eggs!

I've done everything physical (short of getting some outrageous piercings or tattoos....hmmm maybe i should consider that navel ring......) to signify a fresh beginning- I've got my hair cut shorter than I've ever had it before (my way of losing the old baggage), getting a new bag for work (literally losing the old baggage), threw out 3/4 of my room so on and so forth and all that, no matter how hard - losing the hair being the hardest- is only the beginning of the emotional chances that are to come.
The fact that the rioters have no programme is therefore itself a fact to be interpreted: it tells us a great deal about our ideological-political predicament and about the kind of society we inhabit, a society which celebrates choice but in which the only available alternative to enforced democratic consensus is a blind acting out. Opposition to the system can no longer articulate itself in the form of a realistic alternative, or even as a utopian project, but can only take the shape of a meaningless outburst. What is the point of our celebrated freedom of choice when the only choice is between playing by the rules and (self-)destructive violence?

In the absence of scientific certainty, all children who regress into poor health after vaccination should be given a fair hearing in the federal vaccine injury compensation program and generously compensated when no other plausible cause can be found for what happened to them after vaccination. Congress intended the vaccine injury compensation program to be non-adversarial, fair, generous and humane. If it cannot function the way it was intended to function, then parents have every right to call for its repeal and a return to unrestricted lawsuits.

Trouble begins to brew on an Oknawan island when Ao crosses paths with a trio of smugglers led by Gazelle. Ao comes into possession of a glowing green bracelet, and suddenly a “scub coral” emerges from the ground, and a “G-monster” emerges from the sky. They eventually retreat, but return the next morning, causing widespread destruction. Worried about his adoptive grandfather and sickly friend Narau, Ao is cornered by Gazelle & Co., but refuses to relinquish the bracelet, which reminds him of his mother…

Most of the small groceries are owned by first or second generation immigrants and are supplied by one or two beverage wholesalers. This limits the selection to products that are fast movers because of major media advertising and promotion. However, in cases of one reason or another, a real beer bargain can be had.

This March 31 was the anniversary of me getting clean. I had been clean for 21 years, yet I was in full blown emotional and behavioral relapse. I was at my lowest emotional point of my life, but somehow I did not drink alcohol or use drugs. People were congratulating me on my 21 years of recovery and I felt like a fraud. I was clean, but I was NOT in recovery.

Sad Songs and Waltzes by Willie Nelson
Picture it—you’re a young widow woman, scratching out a living raising goats and chickens in the beautiful hills of rural Pennsylvania. You make lovely scented soaps from the goats’ milk, and sell the soap and chicken eggs at the local farmers market. Your trusty beagle and cat curl up with you at night, and you visit each morning with the mail man, listening to him deliver local gossip along with the U.S. mail. Sounds somewhat idyllic, doesn’t it? Don’t hold your breath.
Well, we are in interesting times…life can only get funnier and it is getting funnier, I had to take this picture of a school boy…well, don’t blame me; I though he was another soldier!

Susan Cain’s TED talk “The Power of Introverts” is a fascinating 20-minute lecture describing how a world that undervalues introverts creates a waste of talent, energy, and happiness. She begins with a description of her first time at summer camp, armed with a suitcase full of books “Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity…you have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you, but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind…I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.”

Last week, the doctor put me on a supplement that's supposed to help with allergies, and along with the other supplements and dietary changes, I think it's really helped! The past 4 days, the pollen count has been higher, and I have used my inhaler on average about 1 puff, 1 time each day. What a huge difference!! On top of that, the past two nights I have slept through the night without suffering a coughing/choking fit at. Seriously, I don't know how it's working, but it is! And not because I'm treating the symptoms, but because I am making my body stronger as a whole.

The future is looking bright right now on the National level with Lutz (Soph) and Verzbicas (Frosh) and Futsum Zeinasellassie (Frosh, In) all with potential to finish high at the National Level this year. Another challenger may be Jakub Zivec. Jakub has been running amazing times in the JV races in MN. In these cases he is running faster than the varsity times and coming close to course records. He has track PRs of 3:57.07 for the 1500 meters and an 8:19.35 for 3000m so he is for real. Jakub is a Czech exchange student who attends his MN high school without being part of a recognized international exchange program. Because of this he is not allowed to compete at the varsity level.
There are times in your relationship when the two of you just have moments that make your heart melt and jump for joy at the same time. They don't happen everyday but they aren't scarce either. There is one though, that happened a few months ago that still sticks in my mind and needs to be shared!

There were 4 different images to use--beach babe by Close to my heart---sparkling summer by SU--- beach chair, umbrella and ball by Great Impressions and ---hammock by Savvy Stamps. I chose the beach babe to color up from CTMH. I colored her with my copics and then had a blast putting together my card....

I watched Scream 4 solely because I am a completist. Nature abhors a vacuum, although there was really no big hole to be filled from the lackluster Scream 3. my big issue coming into the film is how its motif would fit in with today’s horror. The Scream series is as much a satire on horror as it is horror itself. The genre has changed a lot in the last decade with torture porn, found footage, zombie flicks, and ghosts of creepy kids replacing the hack and slash films of which the series used to poke fun.

During our 2008 strategic planning session we determined that the association needed a governance plan. In the past as leadership in the association changed from year to year our governing processes also changed. Since there was no formal plan the governing process varied with each new president or executive committee. A Governance Committee was appointed, chaired by Jim Guerin. This committee spent hours reviewing the John Carver’s “Boards That Make a Difference” and developing a governance plan for NATM. The plan clearly defines the responsibilities of the board, volunteers, executive director and staff. Now the plan doesn’t vary from year to year and we all have a clear definition of our responsibilities. As a result we have become much more efficient in running the association and improving member services.

Elvenstar is a purely hunter-jumper barn with its rider base made up of mostly juniors. Because of this, the big focus is on equitation. I must say that I am incredibly thankful for that focus since I feel that it has largely contributed to my riding style today. When I was younger, according to the head trainer, I "didn't have a rider's body," and was therefore shunted from the hunter and equitation competitions to jumper ones. But, the lessons were the same and I still learned a good deal about showmanship, rhythm over a course, and subtle aids.

The nature in which each and every individual deals with the matters they find themselves wrapped in will naturally vary and in Maurice Kirks cases, himself quite a colourful character who is not afraid of voicing his opinions, naturally lead to further needless ambushes which have affected his health and well being, let alone financial constraints which such a proud and self made man should not be subjected to.

I immediately sent messages to Zawi and Sherry about it – in stressing to “Just come and sign something; no money required”. I had also sent a few messages to a 27-year-old who was my junior at Gambang; telling him about all this. And asking him to stand by, just in case…

“No. At the moment of a corporeal death the spirit of the current mortal form immediately tries to connect to the inner personalities of its’ previous lives. This causes a snapping pulsation that summons the white glowing mist to appear immediately to welcome its own. The mist responded to these four but found nothing waiting to enter.

Melt butter in a skillet. Saute the garlic for 2 minutes to infuse the butter. Place the bread crumbs in a mixing bowl and add half the garlic butter, set aside. To the remaining garlic butter in the skillet, add shallots and spinach, cook for 3 minutes until the spinach wilts. Deglaze the pan with Pernod. Season with salt and pepper, add a dash of red pepper sauce. Allow the mixture to cook down for a few minutes. Finish off the bread crumbs by mixing in olive oil, Parmesan and chervil, season with salt and pepper. Spoon 1 heaping teaspoon of the spinach mixture on each oyster followed by a spoonful of the bread crumb mixture. Sprinkle a baking pan amply with rock salt. Arrange the oysters in the salt to steady them. Bake in a preheated 450 degree F oven for 10 to 15 minutes until golden. Serve with lemon wedges and red pepper sauce.

Artisans want to be where the action is; they seek out adventure and show a constant hunger for pleasure and stimulation. They believe that variety is the spice of life, and that doing things that aren't fun or exciting is a waste of time. Artisans are impulsive, adaptable, competitive, and believe the next throw of the dice will be the lucky one. They can also be generous to a fault, always ready to share with their friends from the bounty of life. Above all, Artisans need to be free to do what they wish, when they wish. They resist being tied or bound or confined or obligated; they would rather not wait, or save, or store, or live for tomorrow. In the Artisan view, today must be enjoyed, for tomorrow may never come.

Like lots of us in wine I have tried a great many Australian wines in my time.

On a brighter note Alyson has found a good use for raw garlic. Garlic is both antibacterial and antiviral! Any time Alyson has a cough or a sniffle she chops a clove in half and swallows them like pills. Its cheaper and more natural that the capsules they sell in the store and it works well. But be warned it is still garlic and 1 or 2 days later you may smell it again, if you know what I mean….

The weather outside is just nasty. We go the entire winter with hardly any winter weather and now, on the first day of March, the skies open: rain, sleet, occasional snow, and blow-you-over wind gusts have set up shop and are supposedly sticking around for the rest of the day. Honestly? I'd take the snow over the rain when it's this cold outside. Snow can brush away, swirl around you... rain just soaks. Anything and everything.

Step 5 The Break. While you are giving a final pat, break. Lift your hand smartly away. Don’t slide them over your body in a lingering manner. This may confuse them and you. Alternatively, you could finish by gripping your friends firmly on the upper arms and saying something celebratory “well done, congratulations” or “great to see you again”. This makes the reason for the hug clear and finishe it succinctly. Another great option is to throw a few playful sparring punches at each other, add a growly cheer to this and you are home and dry like a big, cuddly bear. Now, return to whatever you were doing before the hug. Don’t feel the need to cough, avoid eye contact or scratch yourself. You are still firmly a man.

This applies to life as well. I am a big get-things-done person, and there have been many times I find myself focusing so much on my To-Do lists (yes, plural) that whole minutes, hours, days have passed me by. I have to put myself into life--stand in my own story. I need to pay attention to what is happening. Right. Now. And if that means less things get crossed off my list (like a triumphant blog return) or I close the laptop more and focus on what's happening around me, then so be it.

It's a hard thing to talk about sometimes. I see the hopelessness of poverty, but I am not impoverished. I see the inequality on educational opportunity, but I am well educated. I see the inherent travesties of judgment and racism, but I am as white as white gets. I see the pervasive misogyny in the media and among our politicians, but I am a male. In the end, no matter what I think or how I feel, I am a middle-class well-educated White male. It is easy to say that because of this, I do not suffer, I do not feel, I do not grieve. But to say that would be wrong, because we are not speaking about injustices against me, we are speaking about injustices against humanity. I have a right, a calling - perhaps even a responsibility - to feel saddened and enraged and motivated to do something to affect some degree of change.
I have always had a love for a good beef stew. We both enjoy a good beef daube, but it is not a time saver and does take some care until it is brought to the table.

It is almost the same recipe except for a more tender cut of beef and no bacon or Cognac is added.

A hairpin to cross the river to the south bank of the Tillingham, past a Martello tower (now a private residence and inaccessible to the curious), and over the Brede and onto Rye Harbour Nature Reserve, criss-crossed with drainage channels. Drizzle begins to fall from a drab grey sky beneath which sheep graze the thinnest of turf, a veneer over the sandy, stony soil deposited by the sea as it retreated southwards. The horizon is largely featureless: just a few trees. And in the distance, the bulk of Camber Castle.
It’s not all doom and gloom. I think the digital revolution is going to lead to an increase in overall readership, with people now reading on devices and smartphones, people who haven’t bought a book in years.
I share the EDL's goals. When it was discovered that one of their EDL members was a BNP member, he was asked to resign his BNP membership or leave the EDL. The lines are quite clear. I do not support the BNP and never have, but I do support the EDL. We need to encourage rational, reasonable groups that oppose the Islamisation of the West and not leave it solely to fringe groups like the BNP, whose growth has sparked because of their opposition to the encroaching islamisation of the UK (their racial position is reprehensible).
I’ve considered simply using my pockets. Crushing a peanut butter sandwich in your pants for half the day actually changes the texture in a favorable way, infusing the bread with jelly and rendering the otherwise pedestrian meal panini-like. You just have to be prepared to explain to your coworkers the occasional presence of what looked like a blood stain in your right buttock.
“Oh great…” Not only had my irrational fear been publicly unveiled, I now had a team of life coaches teaching ME- a twenty something (and the rest) grown up- how to cross a road. If there was such a thing as the ‘scale of social awkwardness’ this moment in time would register as a 9, 10 being complete and utter social humiliation with no return. The only way this situation could have been worse, would have been if all my clothes suddenly dropped off and I was stood on the ‘wrong side’ of the pavement, abandoned, stranded, helpless and BUTT NAKED (with socks on!).

Now, someone could read this list and say these things happen to babies born in a textbook position all the time. Or maybe wonder why it even matters to me.
I have come to record my own things again. Meanwhile busy with settling down further. Yes, I switched the job, I would love to say life is at a better level. Here are my three little things:

Hutchinson plays a major role in the school, where college is omnipresent. Students are assigned college counselors from day one. To prepare students for the next level, the school offers a longer than typical day — about 170,000 minutes longer, over four years, than other city schools — and more than double the usual number of English credits, King said
Jester King is also challenging the restriction of breweries from selling direct to the public and that of brewpubs selling to retailers or distributors, both changes that were pushed unsuccessfully in the last legislative session. The claim against the TABC Code here is violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
I have found that many Christians rely more on their own ideas and feelings than they do on the Bible, especially when Scripture commands them to do difficult things. In particular, many people seem to believe they can be sure they are doing what is right if they pray and have a sense of ‘inner peace.’ Nowhere does the Bible guarantee that a sense of peace is a sure sign that one is on the right course. Many people experience a sense of relief (‘inner peace’) even when they are on a sinful course, simply because they are getting away from stressful responsibilities.’
will be coming to jellen's house of fabric. we have come to love marie with a very special fondness. not only are her books beautifully crafted and compelling to read from the perspective of a quilter, her character development of howard, a young man with down syndrome, is touching and obviously hits close to home for us. you can read more about that here.

We are very excited about the site’s look, feel and functionality. We hope you will be too and that you will come back to see what’s new on the site as it continues to evolve. Our new website offers a tremendous platform to share the mission and activities of the organization while featuring the artwork of our members. There’s plenty of room to grow and expand in the future and we have the capability to maintain, update and change the content ourselves. So while the site is now “live”, it will never really be “done”.

I'm not going to make this a religious experience or blog. One could substitute several words in the above prayer and it would apply to other religions or philosophies, and let me make sure to say that my way is by no means the right way. Afterall, I've said it before, I'm a Christian with a bent antennae. The passion with which we get to live and love has me falling down on my knees with gratitude. And to be blessed with the gift of storyteller, is one of the best gifts a person could receive.

In the morning I was starting to feel better as the contractions had subsided considerably, thank goodness. I was starving, and after getting the Dr's approval I ordered a serious feast for breakfast - pancakes, eggs, sausage, hashbrowns and orange juice. And let me say this - that food was delicious! I thought hospital food was supposed to be nasty, but that food rivaled the best breakfast places around town! I'm totally looking forward to that food again when it's time for this baby to make his arrival - hopefully somewhere around the 40 week mark, of course.
Sometimes I pretend to be just a girl. With just a smile and just a face and a mouth that opens wide and beckons with white teeth and curling lips. But it does no good. Everyone knows. Everyone knows I have a basket of dreams and thoughts that do not belong to this world.
Process papers quickly. Throw away the junk mail very soon; pay the bills very soon; process everything to complete.
Amit Bansal answers, The perfect reply is a genuine reason of why you are leaving your current job. Most companies only want to check your commitment level when they ask this question. If you were not leaving your current job you would not be able to join them. And the reason they are interviewing you is because they want you to join. So don’t panic, this question doesn’t mean they want to reject your candidature. They just want an affirmation of your commitment.

Michael DeMane, president of Sofamor Danek, Medtronic's spinal business, reportedly said the company has spent $25 million to $30 million over the last several years in legal costs associated with these patents.
Landowner Rusty Roodt told The Witness the police in Hilton have failed to act on his complaints that people are invading his land; and nothing has been done to halt them.
Take my case load for instance: I have about 18 juveniles I need to see in 2 different cities. One city is about 45 minutes away and the other is bout 20 minutes away in the other direction ahaha. Say nine kids in each city, most of them I need to meet with them AT LEAST 2.5 hours a month. Doesn’t seem that bad at first but 2.5×18=45hrs i need to see clients. Consider 4 weeks at 40 hours…so 160 hours of work time. 45 hours out of 160 doesn’t seem that bad until you add in 45min drivex2, down and back, and 20minx2 so…round to 3 hours of driving. double that as i go to each city at least twice a week…and half for Friday. Therefore…say 8 hours driving a week, a month is 32hrs . Up to 77 hours. Then each day the kids have lunch around the same time, so 5hrs a week, 20 a month. Up to 97/160 hours, getting close huh? Now for more maths!!! Each meeting needs to be documented as a progress note, those per person should take around 10-15mins…lets say 15mins to account for brain lag. So i would see the kids for 2 2 hour sessions and a 30 minutes, for simplicity sake. That’s 3 visits a client, at 18 clients…that’s 54 visits at 15 minutes a note for each visit. So that’s…13.5 hours of notes which adds up to 110.5/160 hours. Now lets include the various times needed to go get the client, wait for the school to get them, or other miscellaneous times per kid…say an hour a kid for each month. That is easily 18 hours…so 128.5/160 hours. A have an intensive meeting with other staff twice a month at an hour each and about two case manager meetings a month, 1.5 hours each. Meeting times equal to 5 hours easy. Up to 133.5/160 hours. So a pretty full but manageable schedule right?
Let’s go back to that exercise above: I would want any of Players A-D on my favorite team, without question. Some of them have perceived character flaws, but that kind of information is almost completely irrelevant. All four of these players have proven performance and top-flight skill that overcomes any kind of real or imagined character shortcoming. Crucial to this is the following: none of them are extraordinarily uncomfortable with their team or city, and none of them let off-ice problems impact their gameplay performance (or if they do, they’re good enough that we don’t notice). When Carter-esque character is not in the discussion, character simply doesn’t matter.
Putting together puzzles with pattern blocks using a template gets them matching shapes. I use colored templates to begin, then move to black and white ones, I think I would like to add ones that are just an outline so they have to figure out how to fill the space. I usually include a printable where they record how many of each shape was used. The kids also like to use paper pattern blocks to glue together designs. HeidiSongs has a free download of printable pattern blocks HERE.

Then came the videos. We watched five bits of video on instruction as discussion fodder, and to think about just what instruction is. (I've been thinking a lot about this lately, too, spurred on by Dave Coffey as he thinks about renaming the instruction phase on the cycle.)
In the brief moment she could use her phone, she managed to speak to Moo Yul’s manager and tell him where they were. He comes to save them and all is well in the world again.
For us, contraceptives are the answer until I am 200% sure that menopause has really hit. And Rush, if you really want a video of my husband and I doing it with birth control when we are 48 years old, let me know. It could probably be used to scare kids away from sex. ;)
If you have a chance to look at it, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
Still, even the ESDC acknowledged in June that “prolonged adverse economic conditions” could slow all buildings after the arena and just one tower.
I would listen to her babble. And then, all of a sudden, know one would see her. As if she crawled back into her dark cottage.

Have you ever paused to think about your limiting beliefs? Many of us have the same ones. I’m not good enough, I’m not lovable, if I say what’s on my mind I might offend someone, I’m not worthy, it’s all my fault, I’m going to fail, if I don’t do something perfectly I’ll be criticized for it. The list goes on and on. You probably have a few of your own that resonate with you. Maybe you have mommy issues, or daddy issues, or abandonment issues. We all have them. The more I read, the more this tie in makes sense to me, especially with autoimmune conditions. If I was walking around all the time thinking that I wasn’t good enough, it was all my fault, and I was a failure, then I was literally beating myself up on the inside. It also makes all the sense in the world to me that my body would respond in kind and start beating itself up. And in my humble opinion, that’s exactly where my autoimmune condition came from.
Allowing relay on an email server can cause some major problems, though. The biggest problem is with spammers. Spammers have software that will go to as many public IP addresses as possible, looking for IPs that respond on port 25. If a server responds, the software will attempt to send an email to a recipient by creating a relay session. If the relay session succeeds, that server is tagged as an “Open Relay” and the software will attempt to use that server as a source for loads and loads of Spam. This often results in massive mail queues and the server that is being used to relay mail will often be blacklisted and legitimate mail from that server ends up getting blocked by email systems that use blacklists as a form of spam filtering. In other words, having an open relay can cripple your Email infrastructure in any number of ways.
Oh, Williams, let’s clarify your position, since you surreptitiously tried to clarify your position--and failed:
This is how this recipe goes. First, find some nice ginger. That may not be as easy as it sounds since ginger is imported from warmer climates such as India and China. If there is not a lot of demand in a market, they can be small and shriveled indicating age. They should always be firm and free of mold. The ginger needs to be peeled so try to find nice large pieces with fewer branches. Sometimes they are small with many branches and these produce much smaller pieces and is more time consuming to peel. Here is my tip for finding the best ginger - Asian markets. I always see beautiful ginger in Philadelphia's Chinatown along with many other Asian produce and ingredients and the prices can't be beat. The amount of fresh ginger I bought for $2 one time was amazing.

Another few weeks training have come and gone and fitness is returning to where I need it to be to take on the next few months (Duathlon, ½ marathon and Marathon all by middle of April), and now that a large distraction, which would have seen me doing the Baxters Loch Ness Marathon, has been removed I have been able to throw more effort into my training and concentrate on the task in hand. I am still using a 3-day-a-week training programme, with a short (5 mile) effort session mid-week, a run to work and home “split day” on a Friday (anywhere between 13 and 18 miles in total), with pack and the standard 15 mile+ LSD run on a Sunday, which will see me right for the London Marathon. Once the Marathon is over I will then be adding an extra weekly run and pushing the Friday run up to 30 miles in preparation for the Grand Union Canal Race in late May, including running to, running in and running home from the Halstead Marathon in May.
At my Aunts house I passed on any biscuits that were offered around and stuck to orange juice.

The equipment included encoding de-vices and radio monitors capable of tracking, intercepting and interpreting encoded signals. There was a meeting with representatives of the Irish Republican Army, who wanted American-made M-16 rifles. Mulcahy learned that such weapons could be found in plentiful supply; North Vietnam had sold its surplus weapons – seized in huge quantities after its army overran South Vietnam in 1975 – to Samuel Cummings of Interarmco, the European-based arms dealer. It was in England also, Mulcahy says, that Terpil asked him if he wanted to earn $5,000 on his return flight to Washington by detouring to Cairo to deliver a ”cold gun,” one with no identifying serial number. Mulcahy refused to deliver the weapon, but did learn months later that Qaddafi had provided Terpil and Wilson with a $1 million contract to assassinate Umar Abdullah Muhayshi, a Libyan defector who had plotted to overthrow Qaddafi’s regime. The assassination assignment had been subcontracted by Wilson to three anti-Castro Cubans in Miami with whom he had once worked in the C.I.A. ”Frank was playing both ends against the middle,” Mulcahy recalls. ”He was setting up an elaborate security system for the guy in Egypt to protect him while at the same time trying to bump him off.” Mulcahy and Terpil got along well and the two men exchanged many confidences during their trips together. ”Frank tends to talk a lot; he likes to name-drop,” Mulcahy says. ”What charges Frank’s batteries is the thrill of the chase, the excitement, being on the periphery of power. He thrives on it.” In time, Mulcahy said, he came to realize that there was more truth in Terpil’s seemingly wild stories than he had thought.
Perhaps the single greatest unknown when considering the likely course of future developments is the role of the state. Where the apparatus of state is strong and considered legitimate by the population it governs, will it seek primarily to stifle opposition to Islamization, for whatever reason? Will it remain effectively neutral, maintaining order and enforcing the law as even-handedly as possible? Or will it turn on its Muslim population, killing, incarcerating, and deporting them in an effort to reverse the inexorable Islamization it has belatedly woken up to?

When faced with a dilemma over what to order, the best thing to do is share. We engineer a three-course degustation of entrees which allows us to sample everything we'd been eying lustfully on the menu. The organic farm egg is a buried within a nest of crunchy potato twigs, eventually spilling its runny yolk over a bed of potato cream.
The memories, finally recollecting my childhood, made everything make sense. It made my entire conscious life make sense. But the aftermath of discovery is what is almost killing me on a daily basis. It changes everything. It’s like discovering my own death – and in many ways I did die back then.
As Lord Justice Jacob correctly pointed out in the preceding judgment, the question involved in Bellure, as well as in the earlier O2 case, is how competitive the law allows European industry to be. The answer to this question may, however, be based only on encompassing consideration and the weighing up of all the interests involved and not only those of competitors and customers. This is the aspect which is clearly missing in Lord Justice Jacob's decision.
I had a pretty good summer hanging out with my son and family and went to eastern washington a lot to Lake Chelan and Winthrop as I have access to a cabin there. And this weekend we got back from my dad's cabin which isn't too far from where I live so I got a chance to go out on the lake and did some kayaking. Anyway, I'm not dead and still kicking and will try to find out if some of you are still blogging.

There have already been worries lifted amongst a few, together with Jones, that the regulation could result in racial profiling and police stopping Mexican Americans because they could be suspected banned migrants. Jones thinks that his primarily latin-american members are residing with the fear of being charged.
It doesn’t matter to us who wins some argument. The battle is really fought in the mind. The field had expanded as passersby had walked away from our home-made exhibit. And the message had spread, because they had been affected.
One doubts Grayson's students would say they're better off for his arrest. One former student commented on the KXAN site, "I remember Ian Grayson from when I went to Austin High because he gave me a hug on my last day there." Another student declared, "Gotta love how they fire the best history teacher at our school because of something so stupid as possession. I guess an illegal plant takes more priority over a good education."

Usually, I would just ditch my board and swim down, but I had an old leash on (another smart move), which could easily snap. The last thing I wanted to do at that point is take the rest of the set on the head without my board.
The milled flour is often chemically bleached to improve the color and baking quality and enriched with vitamins and minerals to replace those lost by removing the bran. The average flour yield is 70 to 74 percent of the weight of the grain.
I bring my Planetwise medium wetbag everywhere which helps store my dirty diapers. I make sure that I have wipes, a changing pad, extra inserts, and my wetbag.
