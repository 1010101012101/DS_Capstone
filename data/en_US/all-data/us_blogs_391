This is the picture that almost wasn’t. A thunderstorm was rolling in as I walked home from the bus stop. I went directly to the deck to snap my photos. Between the rain, darkness, and humidity (the camera lens fogged up!), I am amazed I managed to get any decent pictures. The storms (and tornado watches) continued all evening.
Hi guys, just popping in!
The first one (aka the biggest one) is just a notebook I bought in Mexico a few years back because I need something to write with when I was there. I just wrote in 5 pages and never touched it again until I decided to go on with journaling. I like this size for journals because it’s not so big that I can’t fit in my bag or just becomes a burden to me. All of my untyped and unfinished stories are here and some notes I took for class too (kekekeke).
2. I prefer to be on the left side (when walking, sitting, standing…always). When someone/something is on my left side it feels like an imbalance to me.
I recognize my own pain mingled with joy as I imagine how she must have felt. I understand intimately this year how her heart must have ached, and yet been flooded with a certain peace. How she had to rest in the Lord's mighty arms, secure in her status as highly-favored and deeply loved. How she gently wrapped her Creator in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger to watch him slumber, the Lord's heartbeat loud in her ears.
Please start to think about an activity you would like to create and duplicate for your group. (perhaps have a 2nd choice in case it's taken)
“As we grow older we become more conscious of the complexity, incoherence, and unreasonableness of human beings; this indeed is the only excuse that offers for the middle-aged or elderly writer, whose thoughts should more properly be turned to graver matters, occupying himself with the trivial concerns of imaginary people. For if the proper study of mankind is man it is evidently more sensible to occupy yourself with the coherent, substantial, and significant creatures of fiction than with the irrational and shadowy figures of real life.”

About 25 years ago I took a book of mantras out of the Thunder Bay Library, thinking it might provide some tools for meditation. As it turned out, mantras were never going to play much of role in my practice. However, “Om mani padme hum” found its way into my life, coming and going over the years. It was one of three notes taped to various workstation walls. “Work hard and relax” and “Be still and know that I am God” being the other two.
I am SO excited about the future of this blogging hobby I started nearly two years ago! I began this blog with very few (if any!) expectations that anyone would read my blog, let alone care what I have to say or share. The last couple of years have been a wonderful experience and it has been fun to get to know many of you, hear your excitement for food storage increase, and to see how FUN blogs can be!
Their father turned, his glasses gray with dust, obscuring his eyes. "Come closer," he whispered. For the first time in her life, Sam felt afraid of him. But she edged forward, still gripping Abby's hand. When they reached him, their father stepped aside to let them see inside the trunk.

There are millions of people across the country that consider their cats to be a significant part of their family; even as close to them as their own children. It’s no surprise that these people put a great deal of effort into the care of their cats. There is no doubt that cat food is one of the most important expenses in feline care, next to that veterinarian care. With the proper diet, a cat can maintain excellent health, which can extend the life of your furry family member, not to mention cut down on veterinary expenses of serious medical conditions due to malnutrition or insufficient care.

Now to the physics. Newton’s Third law tells us that every force comes with a reaction force (which has the same size as the original force but acts in the opposite direction). When you’re sitting on a chair, for example, you are pushing the chair downwards and in turn the chair is pushing you back up, allowing you to (hopefully) sit comfortably without falling down. If you drop a stone into water, similarly the stone pushes down on the water and the water pushes the stone back up (or in other words, gives a “lift” to the stone). However, there is another force—gravity, that’s trying to pull the stone right down. If the lift trying to push the stone up is not as strong as the force of gravity pulling the stone down, the stone—you guessed it—falls down.

Maybe it's because we were always too cheap to pay wages, but I think it's more likely because we were a bunch of softies who felt guilty at the inevitable demise of such fragile creatures, for whom we felt a responsibility of care. It's bad enough having to constantly replace horses, especially if (by some miracle) they'd lasted a couple of adventures without being gutted and eaten by some hideous abomination.

My mother and my friend Karren shares the same birthday, and thank God they celebrated their birthday at different day! Haha. My “par” Karren celebrated her 18th birthday last March 1. She’s already on her legal age! My friends and I went to Karren’s house to celebrate with her. I thought it was just a simple celebration with no cotillion and all. But I was so wrong! And I’m just wearing simple shirt (biology shirt to be exact), shorts and slippers! Embarassing!!

Summation: Love the setting for this place - outdoor plaza seating next to a beautiful cathedral. I had the veggie quesadilla and chicken caesar wrap on separate days for around $7 each. The food isn't amazing, the quesadilla was kind of bland but isn't bad either for the price - could do worse downtown. Definitely leave enough time to stroll through the cathedral and take-in its amazing architecture.

Perfection is the goal. Jesus commands us to be perfect. He set the standard and anything short of perfection is not to even be thought of. I don’t beat myself up because I fail in my quest today, that would be exactly what Satan would want me to do. But I must keep driving forward . Satan also is happy when I settle for what I am, instead of what I can be. He longs for me to think I have arrived as a Christian. He wants me to think that I’ve done enough in the quest to spread the Gospel. I have never, nor will I ever buy into the old adage about not taking on too much and wearing myself down, for then I would be useless to God. That is a lie of Satan. The only work I should be doing is the work God has called me to do, and God never gives us a mission without providing the means and the strength to do it. Philippians 4:13 (NIV) says that “I can do everything through him who gives me strength.” Not some things or not things when I am refreshed and well rested, but everything.
Anyway, some news. I got my first assignment back, on Ibrahim as an Early Monotheist, which gave me an A (yeah!), and recommendations for improvements, such as explaining why the differences I found are there. I might attempt to incorporate that, but I still wanted to share the done assignment with you, which you can find on the right side on the main page, in the Box-widget. Yes, that’s another new thing, where you from now on will be able to find the various articles I might write, as well as my done assignments, as soon as they are available.
When I first tasted these muffins, I instantly loved them. Once I learned what they were baked with, I was amazed! And trust me when I say “simple” is an understatement. Instead of the usual oil, eggs, and water, these little jewels are baked with pumpkin making them much healthier and, in my opinion, more moist. The best part is, people will never know! Adam ate his fair share before I informed him of the pumpkin baked inside and he still came back for seconds.

These are just ordinary people, who are relentless, selfless, who have little money but loads of love, kindness, or just do it because they have no choice... who else is going to do it. Sometimes they get a little bit of help from the State... a bit of money, a small grant, a ride to a day centre, a bit of respite care, someone who listens, a group they can go to and get a break, or training, or a laugh, sharing experiences. Sometimes.
Meanwhile, as yesterday’s men such as Morrissey of the “Smiths” fire negativity against joy, and as Channel 4′s journalists assume that because someone says that they aren’t necessarily royalist means that they must be a republican, we at A Brand Day Out instead celebrate the joy which is beauty.
So we’re talking about a real and obvious deficit of nearly half a trillion dollars. But that’s nowhere near as bad as it will really be.

Thank you all so much for the enthusiasm on the selvage fabric! I love having this place to share my inspirations and creations. Because, you know, it's different at home. When I asked my 3 year old, "Mama made this, isn't it pretty?", she frowned a bit and agreed, grudgingly, "mmm hmmm." Then she suddenly perked up and asked, "I could walk on it?"
I was born in the 55th year of the Showa reign. Emperor Hirohito died in 1989 and the calendar began again at year one of the present reign. Emperors have no surname. At birth they receive one name. When they are crowned, it is discarded and they take a new one. As a mark of respect, however, Japanese people never refer to the emperor by name, but simply refer to them as ‘Tennou’, meaning ‘heavenly sovereign’. In death, they are renamed once more, after their era. So, the Showa Emperor of Japan was formerly Emperor Hirohito, who was formerly Prince Michinomiya. In a similar way, most Japanese are born Shinto, marry in Christian churches, and die Buddhist, and nobody considers this to be strange. Nor is it considered conflicting that when asked, almost all Japanese answer that they do not believe in any god. Nor is this seen to be at odds with the fact that temples and shrines are sacred places, revered by the Japanese, at which people regularly attend, pray, and give offerings.

I was right about that night. I never forgot it. And as I went through my youth and young adult years it struck me amazingly how Providence always seemed to protect me from disaster. Whether it was not going when the light turned green as a teenager, or knowing exactly what to say to the man who had pulled his gun on me during my full-time missionary service, the Lord has reached down repeatedly in my life to protect me from disaster. God’s great love and kindness is something I am without words to express my true thanks.

I wanted to turn back the clock a little to focus on one of my favorite acts from Egypt. There are a lot of uncertainties as far as what the future holds for Egypt, however the revolution has also given many Egyptians hope and a reason to celebrate. The music of Ali Hassan Kuban reminds me of the joyous atmosphere that spread throughout Egypt shortly after the announcement was made that Mubarak was stepping down. My arm has reached its limit now, so I'm going to close out this post by posting a couple of excerpts from the last.fm and Allmusic profiles for Ali Hassan Kuban.

We all know that it is important to take a break from work and recharge our batteries, but few of us really understand why. The brain is a muscle and like any muscle it needs to work out (think/stress) to get stronger but it also needs rest to be able to grow (sleep/breaks). An interesting study even shows that a brain that is put under periods of stress with adequate times of rest in between seems to be better at fighting off dementia, epilepsy and migraines.
It was a incredibly painful process for me. But I tried to get the truth out on the film. The truth about two people that love each other. This whole concept is a terrible dilemma of my generation.

Both musically and verbally literate, he has created some of the greatest hip hop albums in history. While I can accept any one of them as being called his finest moment, there is something about the jigsaw nature of The Black Album that appeals to me. He used a different producer on every track, allowing for each to lay down a unique signature, and ultimately show Jay-Z can rap over anything. It’s takes a special type of rapper to pull it off, and Hova doesn’t let you forget it. The album samples more standard fare like the Chi-Lites and MFSB, reggae artist John Holt, and even Jay himself. Then there are samples from Mountain, Madonna, and Billy Squier. It’s a hodgepodge, but it’s hodgepodge that works on every level.

Imagine standing before the Lord Jesus Christ when He says, “You should have hearkened unto me. I sent my apostle, I gave my Word, and I sent the Holy Spirit to convict you of your sin.” It will do no good to bow before Him then. Oh, I know what Philippians2:10says, “That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth.” They will confess that He is Lord but then it will be too late. They will have suffered the extreme loss and spend eternity in the lake of fire.

And although I want you to vote for me, Mitt Romney, I have to tell you... I couldn't be prouder of my competitors. Although we have had our differences, we are united in our rejection of Barack Obama's weak and timid foreign policy. Because Barack Obama hasn't launched nearly enough flying killer robots.

3. But note also: we had it coming to us. Prohibition happened because booze and the people who sold it were out of hand. Saloons were often dens of iniquity, drunken men did squander their paychecks and beat their wives and children, brewers and distillers were corrupt and fed graft money into a corrupt political system. We look back on saloon society and plentiful local breweries and a wide diversity of distillers (oh...for the days of rye distillers in Maryland and Pennsylvania), and we see things through amber-colored glasses, a beautiful Golden Age of Drinking. Well...there were some pretty cool things. But there were some pretty ugly things, too: see Gangs of New York.
Such behaviour passes off in many people’s books as “aggro” alias “killer instinct”. Their logic is, this is a big tournament, there is a lot at stake for “India”. This is the way players let off steam and, anyway, don’t other sides do it too?
I do have lots of answers to this dilemma: more small and community capitalism, more national self-sufficiency, more businesses modelled mutually, more emphasis on tax as a behaviour-changer rather than an income drain, smaller national Government, dumping globalism and, above all, much less notional money swimming about busily infecting the real stuff.

Jaoui is lucid about her own creative motivation. “I wanted to be recognised. I wanted to be loved, and I wanted to be sure I existed.” It seems ironic that a sense of insecurity is the source of such confident film-making. “Yes,” Jaoui admits. “I feel panic at the thought of death. I read the Diary of Anne Frank when I was 11, and it marked me very, very deeply. I’ve been keeping a diary for the past 33 years. That’s why writing has always been part of my life. I had to write so that if I disappeared, people would know I’d been alive, so that I’d know myself I’d been alive.”
Grandma Sarah sent a really interesting article on the affect of music on various subgroups in ‘health care’. I don’t think I can sum it up better than the authors, so I’ll link you to the PDF here: Music_and_Health_Care_Final Aug 2011.pdf (application/pdf Object). I am not surprised by their findings. JT has often shown more attention, interest, and affection while listening to certain types of music. As early as two weeks old, JT cried when listening to Eurovision music but stopped when we put on Bob Dylan instead (results replicated 100% each time we switched). He’s partial to jazz, classical (mozart, chopin) and rock (Boston, Guns N Roses). He LOVES instruments, and he listens attentively to Peter and the Wolf.

I’m not going to waste my precious time and energy on something that does not want to be changed. Last I noticed the bathtub was not aspiring to become the sink or the toilet. Although, I can’t imagine anything wanting to become a toilet, but people choose to become proctologists, so I suppose anything is possible. The bathtub is perfectly happy the way it is. Some might call it grime, but I call it patina.

The Israelites failed to enter the Promised Land because they failed to believe in God’s protection and they did not believe that God would help them conquer the giants in the land.

Learning to communicate with all types of people is important. The most overlooked key to communication is listening. People are naturally selfish and like talking about themselves. Whether it is because we like hearing our own voice or feel that our reason for talking is more important than the people around us. We like talking about ourselves. After all we are often the most important person in our own world’s right? That is not always a bad thing but to communicate effectively you need to care more about what others have to say more often than you tell them what you think. When you can learn to set that selfishness aside in order to listen to others effectively then you will be one step closer to communicating effectively.
For some reason, I can also recall misunderstanding a lady sitting next to us in a smoky little café in Le Marais with a polished wood bar. We ate a hot breakfast of Croque-Madames, with coffee to whet our palettes, preferring the egg on top as opposed to the simple cheese-and-ham Croque Monsieur. I had accustomed myself to the French randomly asking for cigarettes and when the lady gestured and spoke to me in French, I immediately offered her a Lucky Strike. She refused; she was telling us that our smoke was bothering her at the table. C’est la vie, I suppose.

If you’re trying to put together a book, you wouldn’t use different fonts on every page. It seems pretty self explanatory, but make sure that you use common features so that your presentation is pleasing to the eye. Make use of a common color scheme, but don’t go too colorful and loud. Your information should be the main focus, not rainbow colored fonts.
Her new development is climbing stairs. She loves to climb up and down stairs all by herself! She mastered walking up them a few months ago and now she's on to walking down them. Every time we leave our apartment she has to walk down the stairs on her own. Holding on to the rail with one hand and my hand with the other. It's really sweet and fun to watch her learn and grow! She also loves to throw things down the stairs! Every time we go over to Brad and Emily's she throws Mya's toy vacuum cleaner down the stairs, making a huge crashing noise the whole way down. She just laughs and thinks it's the funniest thing ever! The things she thinks are the funniest are when something drops or breaks or when someone falls! Travis says she gets this from my family... I guess I can't deny that!

The small farmers or the middle range farmers will have hard time. Rather than allotting the complete land to the corporates why doesn’t the corporates talk to farmers, with government as the watchful eyes. In order to make sure that issue of less food doesn’t turns out to be a huge one. More importantly a country like India needs to first feed its own rather than allot land to those who might send the food outside. The govt, if and when does this could be pressurized to stop export but corporates have no such limitations. One feels the corporates should be involved in retail and distribution, rather than food production. (which I believe should be their foray as it would lead to organization of an unorganized sector.). Plus there are other sectors where they could do more, rather than food production. No body wants a James Bond movies type situation like we had in Quantum of solace.

The African American church or should I say a very high percentage of the church handles matters that are “easy for them” to deal with and handle. Nonetheless, that is not what the church is mandated to be for. The church is what African Americans call a ” Spiritual Hospital ” where people come to get well, get check ups, operations etc. in the spiritual sense. However, some that come in to the Spiritual Hospital most times leave worse off than how they came in the door. So the church sometimes is viewed as a bootleg place of healing.
How many times have I heard this in my life, “Well, I’m not spending hours a day cleaning my house; I’m out taking my kids to the park or reading to my babies or going to Disneyland.” In other words, the speaker feels badly that they don’t keep their house orderly, so they create a false dichotomy as if there are only two possible choices: enjoy your family and have a trashed house or be a militant shut-in who scrubs the floor 10 hours a day. Though my house is pretty clean and orderly most of the time, I spend a minuscule amount of time actually cleaning it during the week (more on the weekend) and I still go on many park days and library runs. (Although I’ve never been to Disneyland.)

Break down your story into three major plot arcs: the beginning, the middle, and the end. This author does a nice, rather in-depth post about the three-part plot structure – he even has pictures – so I’ll just give you a little suggestion instead: try writing your three arcs as three separate paragraphs. Fitting with the concept of the three-part structure, the first paragraph should be more of an introduction, whereas much of the action would take place in the second and third parts.

The DMR consists of six progressive stages of recovery – transition, stabilization, early recovery, middle recovery, late recovery, and maintenance. Each stage has a primary focus. During transition the primary focus is upon recognizing the addiction and developing the motivation to become abstinent. The primary focus of stabilization is recuperation from the physical, psychological, and social damage caused by addiction. Early recovery focuses upon identifying and changing the deeply entrenched patterns of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that drive people back into the addiction. Middle recovery revolves around issues related to lifestyle repair and the development of a balanced and health promoting lifestyle. Late recovery focuses upon the resolution of family of origin issues that create pain and problems in recovery. Maintenance is the lifelong process of growth and change needed to keep from relapsing back into the addiction.

Being Human's fascination with Mitchell, and its determination to shape itself around him and his stories, was in its first two seasons the show's greatest flaw. The tormented vampire who tries to stop killing is, after all, a rather familiar and even worn trope, and unlike Angel, his obvious template, Mitchell has no mission or life goal to distract either him or us from the monotony of his core dilemma. He spends his time struggling manfully against his desire for human blood, occasionally giving in to that desire, and then beating himself up over his lapse and vowing never to fall off the wagon again (the addiction metaphor is deliberate and made quite explicit over the course of the series, but like True Blood's paralleling of vampires with homosexuals, and especially in light of how Mitchell's story concludes, the analogy is quite problematic). After the third or fourth iteration of this story the audience might be forgiven not only for feeling bored, but for wondering just why such a character--who is either an unrepentant murderer or an irredeemable monster--was still being portrayed as sympathetic and deserving of our affection.

London was the global headquarters of Islamic terrorism in the years before and after 9/11. This fact wasn’t exactly a closely guarded secret, but the WikiLeaks Guantánamo Bay files shed interesting new light on the American perspective.

What do they mean “possible”? Have they not listened to Radio 4?)
Private claimants cannot rely on Proclamation No. 1801 as basis for judicial confirmation of imperfect title. The proclamation did not convert Boracay into an agricultural land. However, private claimants argue that Proclamation No. 1801 issued by then President Marcos in 1978 entitles them to judicial confirmation of imperfect title. The Proclamation classified Boracay, among other islands, as a tourist zone. Private claimants assert that, as a tourist spot, the island is susceptible of private ownership.

Dining out is not the experience it once was. The cell phone sometimes provides the only “music” at a restaurant these days, but more often there is music—or rather noise—loud, thumping, blaring, and totally inconducive to gentle, cultured conversation. It has become virtually impossible to go out to dinner and relax over coffee in most public places. And no one seems to care—no one, that is, except for my husband and me!

While it might be argued that none of this was known to bishop McKiernan at the time, or to his secretary Fr Brady, that is simply because they did not try to find out. This is incomprehensible, as it would be imagined that before restoring any priest’s faculties in such a context there would be an anxiety to ensure he was no longer abusing young people.

I will say that the LDS elder who performed the ceremony was a bit of a tool. He pointed out their age and got some gentle laughter. Then he mentioned their dead spouses. Their age. The fact that he keeps a close eye on them and that he will continue to do so. Their age. Oh, and then he wrapped up the ceremony with the very clear announcement that they will be husband and wife "for the rest of their mortal lives". Not forever, in other words. Not an "eternal bond" seeing as how they'd already been married, thus tainted, and thus the Mormon Church does not seal them together beyond this lifetime.

Hylan was a product of New York locomotive culture. Moving to Brooklyn from upstate New York at an early age, he became a train conductor with the Brooklyn Union Elevated Railroad (later the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, or BRT) which operated streetcars trains in Brooklyn and Queens, including the storied Coney Island trains, carrying thousands of passengers out to the beach each summer. Later the BRT would team with the early subway system of Manhattan's Interborough Rapid Transit System to create a "dual contract" system of unregulated, privately-controlled transportation.

“Let’s Move!” is about making the changes that we need in several key ways. Number one, we’re working to get more information to parents so that they can make good choices for their kids. That's something that's always confusing as a mom: What do you feed your kids? How do you do it?
Also, unlearn the feeling that you “should” do anything. It is easy to think that it’s important what other people think of you. I don’t say that it’s not. But where’s the adventure, if we can’t try things that other people wouldn’t do? Can you imagine, say, Indiana Jones turning around and give up anytime someone said to him “You are not allowed in here” or “That is impossible, don’t waste your time on that”?
Tips to trim photography costs: I would start with recommendations from friends, since it’s hard to find photographers under the radar with a Google search. If you live near a university with an art or photojournalism department, look for students seeking to build a portfolio. Searching Facebook for wedding photographers is also a good place to start. Many new photographers who just started will have a Facebook page but no website.

I am writing my white paper on copyright issues, and after reading through all the bills like SOPA and PIPA, I have come to the conclusion that something is seriously wrong. Things are just too complicated. With DRM, 28 day windows, and platform exclusives it has become far to difficult and convoluted to enjoy the things that we like. Personally, I don’t think that piracy is the issue. The real issue is the convenience of legally available alternatives. So here is my pitch.

But that's enough fact for the moment. Let us get back to the book in question. Binet comments on the book he is writing as he writes it. What kind of book should it be, how best to tell the story; should he perhaps ape the detail of Victor Hugo in order to set the scene - 'I remember one interminable digression in The Hunchback of Notre Dame on the workings of the judicial institutions in the Middle Ages. I thought that was very clever. But I skipped the passage.' Perhaps not then. We learn about his disdain for another winner of the Prix Goncourt, Jonathan Littell's The Kindly Ones (apparently a further twenty pages criticising it were excised at the request of the editor - and can now be read online), the frustrations of writing fiction based on fact ('I keep banging my head against the wall of history. And I look up and see growing all over it - ever higher and denser, like a creeping ivy - the unmappable pattern of causality') his frustrations when those reading some of the factual details assume it must be made up by the author ("But no, it's all true!" And I think: "Damn, I'm not there yet . . .") and we too are then duped by a chapter that seems to fit in with the factual approach of the book only to be followed by this.
Then there’s the creatures.
The player who generated the most buzz today was easily OT Mike Adams. First, Adams measured in at a strong and very stout 6-7 323 lbs. while displaying a massive 82.5 inch wingspan. This is the type of frame NFL personnel people crave from the position as it gives the player a very good blocking radius to work with to keep defenders at bay. In practice Adams showed up strong again, displaying natural athleticism and power as he showed very good quickness of the snap as well. He was sound with his hand placement and showed nice ability to anchor when bull-rushed. Adams also displayed natural knee bend throughout much of the practice but does tend to get a little upright at times, making it easy for defenders to get up under his pads like Marshall’s Vinny Curry was able to do on one occasion. All in all Adams had one of the better days overall and got a lot of praise from everyone in the scouting community. If he can continue like this the rest of the week he should become a sure-fire 1st round draft pick. Iowa State’s Keleche Osemele struggled at right tackle from what I was able to see. His lack of quality foot speed and quickness was very apparent and he played with poor pad level for much of the practice. I have always believed Osemele’s only fit would be inside due to his tendency to get stuck in the mud and struggle to change directions and keep with quicker defensive lineman. As Mike Mayock said on the broadcast his future lies inside where his massive size and strength can be best utilized as he is more of a phone booth type player. Kevin Zeitler (Wisconsin) had a solid practice overall, showing great technique by always keeping his elbows inside and staying square to his opponent. The leverage he is able to create comes from extremely good coaching and discipline, which all Wisconsin lineman seem to possess. Zeitler may not have the upside of a Cordy Glenn or Keleche Osemele but this is a very good football player who should start early in his career and have an instant impact in the running game. The last player I want to talk about is Ohio State’s Mike Brewster who had an up and down day in my opinion. He started out slow but seemed to gather himself and get more comfortable as the practice went on. Early he was overwhelmed and knocked back on his behind as he struggled with quickness and power showing little ability to anchor. However, as practice went on he displayed the nimble footwork that allows him to gain inside positioning on his opponent to create running lanes off his backside. Brewer is a player who seems to have loads of upside but never shows much consistency from week to week or snap to snap even. I’ll be watching this issue closely over the course of the next few days.

This is how genres in literature work for me, too. The very first YA novel I acquired, edited, and published entirely was a realistic YA (How It's Done by Christine Kole MacLean). Novels like Christine's were a prime entry point for me--they're the Neapolitan of my YA reading life--but I pretty quickly branched out, and now I value all of the ways the various YA sub genres riff on the basic YA ingredients and techniques: teenage experience and character-driven storytelling. For example, I like paranormal YA because they are an interesting way of manipulating and exaggerating the ingredients. Sometimes the most outrageous paranormals reveal the most about normal teens.

The interior is worth remembering, a masterpiece of craftsmanship and creativity. The interior is very Victorian Gothic, but with that nice twist of a William Morris feel. A very cozy castle, to be honest. It was a helluva hike to get up there (I DO remember that) and then even more stairs once inside, so definitely NOT for anyone with bad knees, or reduced mobility. The views from the top were stunning, and I remembered some silliness that Julia and I got up to when I was 17 and wild and free in the mountains of Germany.

The important thing about casual sex is that you are isolating all of that intensity to a single experience. It empowers women to understand how much value there is in the act of intimacy and also teaches women that they, like men, can enjoy the act of sex and appreciate the experience as a separate kind of interaction with opposite sex. It isn’t about the emotional connection you feel in a relationship.

I realized I'd forgotten to get cups, so I tossed her my car keys and told her to run to Walmart. As she drove off, I realized that she was driving with an expired license plate (I had the sticker in the glove box), a blown tailight (the bulb was in the glove box too) and all the beer was in the trunk. I called her and told her to drive carefully. As she started to yell at me I said hey, you're the one who wanted excitement. Luckily Walmart was pretty close, so she made it without going to jail.

After the unwrapping (tip for guys: re-use the red ribbon on White Day!), the beer pours a deep amber with little to no head. First taste: It's sweet.

Sure, it's a bit sweet compared to my usual top choices, but it's a pretty decent sweet.

I once heard someone say that habits are like submarines, they are silent and run deep. It would be wonderful to say that habits are not necessarily bad but unfortunately they usually happen because we have not thought of an alternative. We automatically carry out the action our brain tells us instead of doing what we may have actually planned.
A generation of bishops who were in their 70s, “many of them concerned with a 1970s and ’80s way of looking at the Church,” have retired, replaced in recent years by a new age cohort that has “rejuvenated” the episcopacy and brought fresh perspective, Zucchi said.

Lily had been a presence in Daisy's life for some years. They lived in a city large enough for all the amenities, but small enough for people in smaller circles to know one another. Not unlike St. Augustine, which you'll know from reading here, it's a city where, for instance, most of the people singing classical music attend one or another church or synagogue because regardless of their commitment to a given dogma, the best music directors can often be found there. And there are other smaller circles, as there are everywhere. Daisy knew Lily peripherally. They had common friends, knew of one another, finally were introduced casually at a dinner. In its aftermath, Daisy seems to recall nothing but Lily. Laughing, talking, laughing more: it seems to have been one of those moments in which, in movies, all the other characters and sounds fade to distance so that there are only the two people, falling in love. People talked, Daisy says: people looked at other people, after the dinner, and said, "What about Lily and Daisy? They barely spoke to anyone else..."

Except….I then began to feel irritated too – by some writerly spats that were going on – writers are adept at using their erudition as a powerful weapon, to really wound one another. But it has affected me more than I would like to admit…it’s difficult to keep the focus, the mood for words when they are used in that destructive way. It takes some of the pleasure away when I encounter hardness in people. I would like to be harder, a tortoise when it suits, but I still flip over onto my belly and get kicked accidentally, even if none of it is directed at me personally. I’m soft but also a bloody tortoise – I hate conflict, confrontation, fiery attacks. I want to be invisible. So I decided that the writers I love most – Chekhov, Turgenev, the sublime Helen Dunmore, even Hardy with his sentimental fatalism – they are writers with true empathy, kindness, understanding of the human condition. Those are the (famous) writers I aspire to most.

I got up this morning wondering if the November DLC was actually out there and to my surprise it was. Next was figuring out how to get it to show up in game since I bought the Season Pass. Going to the in game Marketplace tab gave no indication DLC was out there even though it did a search for new content when I entered that branch. I found a thread over at daught net that pointed me in the right direction. First go back to the dashboard and download the Freebie car in the DLC, the Scirocco in this case. After the download is complete, restart the game and go into the marketplace. The cars show up now, but instead of saying purchased like the Muscle Car Pack they all say Free. I don’t know what’s up with that, but it seems inconsistent. They were purchased just as the Muscle Car Pack was. I did notice the BMW M5 also said free which was part of the LCE content, weird.

My best friend is a tribal dancer. She got me interested in dancing – but we didn’t have a tribal studio nearby. Then, 4 years ago, I found a Middle Eastern Dance school in my area. It was through one of those summer enrichment catalogues. I looked up the school online and jumped in. I took my first level 1 Egyptian Cabaret class – and I loved it! After years of having two left feet (both of which were on backward), I finally found a dance style that I could learn.

in them towards each other. They are rude sometimes, ill-mannered, whiny and oh, so mean. Those are the moments I truly panic. I wonder what I am doing wrong, is it nature or nurture? I plan what to say to them so they change. I search the library for meaningful books, I read parenting books to deal with situations, I lecture too much and they tune me out. Yet, my heart soars when one writes he is going to teach children in poor countries when he grows up and will buy food for them with whatever money he has and the other easily gives ALL her toys to an AIDS hospice in India at five years of age when we move from Delhi to USA. When my father takes my daughter out to buy a special dress for her birthday, she insists a new dress be bought for her little friend, whose mother cooks for my parents. In Kolkata, when a little child begs for money, both of them take her to a nearby sweet shop and have me buy the sweet of her choice. Then the older one laments they gave her unhealthy food instead of something healthy like fruit. They listen to stories of people in vulnerable conditions after the earthquake in Haiti from their dad and give all their money from their lemonade stand to be used for children in need.

My mum is no longer a part of my life. That has been her choice mostly, I think, although now I am reconciled with the fact that she will never again be a part of my life. People make choices for many reasons; often out of what they fear to lose the most. I have found peace with that. I won't go into the why's and wherefore's here. They are no longer relevant. Since becoming a mum I know that I could never make the choice that my mum made but I understand why she has made the choices that she has and why they mean that we can no longer be a part of each other's lives, although we will always be a part of each other.

Mie Aceh is available in two variations; Mie Aceh Goreng (fried and dry) and Mie Aceh Kuah (soupy). As I once read in Indonesia Eats, Acehnese food has more influenced from Southern Indian food. The thick yellow noodle with slices of beef, goat meat or seafood is served in rich spicy curry-like flavor. Usually sprinkled with fried shallot, and served with emping, slices of shallots, cucumber, and lime.

March days such as this bring the promise of spring following the dark, dreary days of winter. Sure, winter 2011-2012 in my part of Pennsylvania has not been harsh by any means, with disappointing snowfall and an overabundance of mud. There have been a number of "teaser" days in January and February but they are never taken as seriously as those warm days we see in early March. Yes, we could still have a significant snowfall, but that seems unlikely. When I left my office during lunch I was greeted by abundant sunshhine and temperatures in the mid-fifties. I would have been tempted to put the top down on my car, but with all of the "stuff" on the seats that may have turned ugly. My trunk also has a variety of horse equipment in it making it nearly impossible to close the lid in the trunk which allows the hard top to fold into it. Probably better off not doing that anyway....it would have been difficult to come back to the office! This morning after taking Isaiah to school I stopped at the barn to change Suki from her mid weight blanket into a light sheet. Temperatures dipped below thirty last night, so I really had no option but to make a blanket switch in the morning. All of the horses turned to the door as I opened it and Suki nickered to me as I walked in. I know that she heard my car approaching, and looked like she may have just stood as I arrived. As I entered Suki's stall and stepped in a big pile of manure I was pleased that for once I had taken the time to change into boots before going into the barn. On days where I have to do something with Suki before work I just wear my boots there. But when my first stop is Isaiah's school I just can't bring myself to do it! Vanity will get you every time! Suki hungrily took the carrots that I offered, then continued to sniff my pockets for more treats as I exchanged the blankets. I put on a nice clean light weight sheet which I am sure will look much different when I see her tonight! This time I managed to not get drooled on or have water spit on my clothing, but with all of that nuzzling and pocket searching my favorite perfume scent was replaced by "Eau de Cheval"!

I hate when I fall out of the habit of blogging. I love to write and I feel like I’m really missing out when I don’t get a chance to sit down at the end of the day and write. School has been going well, but just so busy. The semester is (surprisingly) flying by. It actually feels really weird to have time go by so fast. I hear a lot of my peers complain about the semester dragging “onnnnn annnnnd onnnn”, and I just don’t get it. They’re so eager to get to the next stage of their life. I understand where they’re coming from, but at the same time, I just don’t feel the same. Right now is the time of our lives. It’s the last stage (and preparing stage) before we’re all off in the “real world” (not to mention, paying back tens of thousands of dollars in loans…). I’m in no rush.
Mostly I'm an expert at not expecting things.

The War Between the States "settled" the matter only by brute force, culminating in something close to terrorism by the North. For 20 years after the war the South was occupied territory, its governance turned over to northern carpetbaggers and blacks. This was not a United States.
This is one area in which I do not like to hark back to the 'good old days.' While Ms Meade and Ms Costa might like to suggest that we all 'work till we drop' like in the good old days, I say that this is one way in which we really 'can't turn back the clock.'

It was a belted kingfisher. He is a maniacal-looking bird. He’s got a white ring around his neck that makes it look like he had been leashed, but escaped. His blue-gray feathers stick straight up out of his head like he stuck his foot in an electrical outlet. He has large wild eyes and a fishing technique that would do the Three Stooges proud. Essentially, he jumps up, flaps his wings, then flings himself at the water. He doesn’t so much dive as plows in a full body flop, through the surface of the pond. He’s effective – he always comes up with a fish – but he gets failing grades for aesthetics.

Part of the pleasure of these racks is that there is no categorising. You cannot plan to go and buy any particular book. There can be no intention at all – whatever you find is a surprise. And that goes a long way to explaining the pleasure of this kind of foraging. Anyway, I have purchased Sei Shonagon and I do hope that wherever she is, she does not miss the royalties she is not getting by the act of my buying second hand.
Over time the physical, emotional, mental and sexual abuse escalated both in frequency and severity. Grace’s life and actions had become mechanical. She never understood why she had to do half the things Denver insisted that she do. It seemed like, the things Denver learned while attending classes on domestic violence, enabled him to take advantage of Grace in order to achieve the marriage he desired. He isolated Grace, socially. He tried to corrupt her mind by keeping her from her friends and family. Letting her know that he was extremely jealous, by barking out ridiculous demands about her appearance and her bodily functions. She wasn’t allowed to answer the door when someone knocked, unless Denver was home. Grace was told not to check the mailbox, not to talk to people, and she wasn’t allowed to speak on the phone more than thirty seconds. Denver showed her that he was possessive by demanding she never bathed, unless he was there to check her and make sure she hadn’t been with anyone else. She was not to change clothing without his permission, and she wasn’t allowed to buy any feminine toiletries. She was never to wear a dress or shorts. To show her legs or her cleavage at anytime in any way would call for strict discipline.
As an adult, I felt differently.
All of this, however, has to be viewed in the context of the complete and utter failure of the Afghanistan campaign, typified by the experience of the Kajaki power project in Afghanistan, as narrated by the BBC's Mark Urban on yesterday's Newsnight, and repeated today in a BBC documentary.

Garrow does recount a few adoptions into the U.S. (but not Canada), but even these experiences lack the "ring of truth" for those who have personally walked through the paperwork and logistical maze of U.S. Immigration procedures. As I pointed out above, Garrow seems to maintain that all one needs to do to obtain a Chinese infant is to procure some forged adoption documents and show up at the U.S. border with child in hand. He seems ignorant of, or completely ignores, the pre-adoption approvals required (I-600, CCAA approvals, etc.) to obtain an entry visa for the child to enter the U.S.

HOW does one decide????? What if I get started and change my mind – what if it’s too late? ARgh.
The Government was guilty of having the same stereotypes of lone parents that had persisted for a long time, that is, people are sort of welfare queens sucking off the social welfare system and they must be driven off their dependency on social welfare and forced to work. The Bill’s provisions will have the opposite effect. The campaigning of the lone parent organisations established in recent months and of groups such as SPARK, One Family and Treoir, which have shoved the reality of the experience and character of lone parents in the Government’s face, forced the Government to acknowledge last week that it got this matter wrong and that implementing the cuts contained in this Bill without having the necessary child care system in place would be detrimental and drive lone parents out of work. We need a Scandinavian model of child care if the Bill is not to drive lone parents out of work.
Hopefully, we as parents can take the time and love we need to examine all of our choices to see if they make sense and feel right. But we should also be sure to think about what our children would say if they had a voice - and then find ways to give them that voice as early as possible, listen to it, heed it, and allow them the freedom to express. And, hopefully, we will be able to live our lives in such a way that, with time, child abuse can be eradicated from our society.

Really? You’re surprised by this? I’m not. The lunatic fringe don’t want to have a conversation. That’s the absolute last thing they want to do. Indeed, they want to shut down the conversation. That’s the whole point, after all. That’s why their leaders talk over everyone else on shows like Meet The Press, that’s why they staged the summer Town Brawls, shouting down even the members of Congress hosting these events. That is why they are always being whipped into a frenzy, and that is why they are perpetually “steaming in anger.” The absolute last thing these people want is a conversation, because when we have a conversation reason wins. And they are the opposite of reason.

Wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley and cereal grains are filling and fairly inexpensive, especially if you buy in bulk. Opt for whole grains, which offer more nutrients and fiber. Oatmeal makes a nutritious, satisfying breakfast for just pennies a serving, while brown rice can be served at any meal (it's pretty good heated up with milk and honey).

It was an epic journey - great weather and lovely accommodation. We also decided to have our luggage transported for us, which was one of the best decisions we could have made. Firstly, it avoided heavy lugging on those Scottish hills and secondly, it meant that I could take as many books as I liked.

UPDATE, 24 Dec 2007:
I spent the week wandering around the north, in the Pomerania region. I’d only been to the south-ish part before, and despite Berlin’s close proximity to Poland, I had yet to go in the almost year I’ve lived here. Since I’m leaving Germany soon it seemed necessary. And I hate to say this now but I was excited because I love the trains in Poland. They’re unbelievably inexpensive, run on an extensive network, and take you through really interesting sights along the way. Sometimes some grim sights, but also some gorgeous ones and it’s worth it for those. Besides, I think that getting an idea of the whole picture of a country involves taking its dark sides with its sunnier, shinier ones. Which means be prepared for what you might see. If I had to sum it up in two words: Chickens EVERYWHERE.
The photos and video here show people who answered the call to gather in Nouakchott, on January 17, 2012, to commemorate the sacrifice Yacoub made, and to honour the family and the beloved country he left behind.
One of my family's Turkey Day traditions is to read a portion of the 1936 Thanksgiving Day proclamation of Wilbur Cross who was governor of Connecticut at the time. I'm not sure why this became a tradition since no one was living in Connecticut then. My guess is that my grandmother liked it because it has a nice ecumenical ring.

I had such a great time playing PongCano with both my daughter and my students. I am a lousy shot, so I lost both times I played  I like this game because it’s different than the board games we always play. It’s more active. This game does not take up a lot of space, which is nice. My only wish is that the game came in a box so that it can be stored. At this point, once the game is taken out of the package, the box can’t be used. I placed the game in a plastic bag so that I don’t lose the ball and the chips. However, to me, this is a minor issue. The game is a blast and I look forward to practicing my aim!

Now I could repeat the usual benefits of joining an S/O/Frat/Sorority and I will: brotherhood, sisterhood, scholarships, purpose, support system, network, etc. Every last one of them are true if that’s the reason why you decided to join in the first place. I defend S/O’s because I got more than that in the processes for both: I discovered a capacity for strength, passion and bravery. I discovered more about me. And I did it by putting myself out of my comfort zone and in a place that always asked if I could do better, that required commitment, deep introspection and a sense of unity. I am a better woman and consider both instances to pledge some of the best decisions of my life.

The plot (more of the book) reminded me a lot of The Notebook also written by Sparks. In the book, it is only assumed that (*SPOILER ALERT*) Jamie dies, but in the movie it happens for sure. Which isn’t a crazy big difference but it has an emotional element to it. The list of differences could go on and on. The way Jaime and Landon meet, basically everything about the play, and foundations about their parents are completely omitted.
There are lots of things on the menu I'd like to go back and try including the wild boar sloppy joe, shrimp and grits, loaded baked potato gnocchi and pork belly. But when I do, I'll be sure not to order and eat them all in one sitting.

I usually hate mayonnaise, and substitute Greek Yogurt in recipes that call for it. But on this sandwich, the faux mayonnaise was really was the “magic” that held everything else together.

Ignoring the eternal wall which God enshrined, the State ran roughshod over its weakest people. With its legal and authoritative siege-works, the State breached these intimate, feminine walls.

The Sam Houston Room on the second floor has always been a museum room as well as an official State Guest Room, but in 1982, Governor Bill Clements set aside another State Guest Room in honor of the Mansion’s first occupants, Elisha and Lucadia Pease. Another bedroom has been divided into a bathroom and dressing room, and the latter has been pressed into service as an office for the First Lady. So excluding the two museum rooms, the second floor private quarters consist of one large bedroom, two smaller ones, the dressing room/office, a kitchenette, and a living/dining room.
The CAMBRIDGE CENTRE for the study of WESTERN ESOTERICISM is independent of any academic or esoteric communities, the co-ordinators share an interest in the need for a wider dialogue between scholars and practitioners in the field of Western Esotericism and in the establishment of a secular space in which an interdisciplinary network can thrive (see people).

Nothing worked. If they found an intact artifact, like an electric car or a camera, it was fried. They came across a gas powered riding mower and it was blackened and showed evidence of scorching. There were many other things charred and sending up plumes of smoke. Judd was certain they would find nothing of use here. So they left the university and headed out to the main roads that were mostly uncluttered.

It's the middle ground where I have a problem. I feel like I get so much more value at a thrift store. Take this weeks finds. A wool pencil skirt, three leather belts, and a pair of vintage leather shoes (skirt, shoes, and one belt below). I purchased all five for $8.50. There is no way I could get new items of this quality for anywhere near that price. I might be able to get one of these items in a lesser material (polyester, vinyl, etc.) for $8.50 but even that is a stretch.

I agree absolutely about the bullet-pointed conference paper. It was good to hear my ideas confirmed.
Look how many followers Maureen Johnson has. She didn't get many by talking about her books. Notice how many of her tweets show her interacting with those followers. (When she has a phrase in quotes with someone's user name, that's her way of RTing a question or comment to her, then she'll type her answer after that.) Whenever she does mention a new release or other good news about her books, it doesn't bother anyone because that's not what her twitter feed is about. It's about her being herself and having fun talking to people about whatever's going on with her (or her weird neighbors). I'm not saying you have to tweet as much as she does--she's obviously a vampire who needs no sleep, or she has a well-trained army of monkeys to do her work for her. Tweet as little or as much as you're comfortable with, but remember to be yourself and get to know people.
This point comes into view clearly with his discussion of war. Henry dismisses Christian pacifists as not an accurate reflection of God’s justice because they might let evil devour unabated, and thus he argues a loving Christian is sometimes forced to bare arms and kill. This may or may not be true, but a false distinction is drawn between war and doing nothing. In reality, there are many options in between and Christians, especially those in public service must make sure they are all exhausted.

If I-1125 is a Uwe Boll movie destined for perpetual repeat on the Syfy channel, then I-1183 (the Costco one) is the too-big-to-fail blockbuster that had star power and huge press going in. And like the blockbuster, it had its great opening weekend, carrying handily to allow the poor, impoverished big box stores to market megaliters of Jack Daniels. The deal won't go down for another six months, so we're about a year out before we start seeing the articles about what went wrong with this plan. For the moment, the Times feels we need to make the change immediately! The people have spoken!
I recently posed a question to my Facebook and twitter followers. “Do you get new clothes for everyone at Easter?” It seems that at one time or another everyone either got new clothes or gets their kids new clothes for Easter. I have been pondering this question myself. I always got the kids something new to wear, and sometimes for myself and Deacon G. I don’t have to worry about his clothes for church anymore though. This year I was struggling with my urges to downsize and minimize while deciding on whether to get everyone new outfits for Easter.

Chaplin was famously conflicted about having the Tramp speak for the first time; he feared it would destroy the character’s appeal. He even went so far as to script Modern Times as a talking picture, complete with dialogue for the Tramp, but later abandoned it. In this one scene, however, the Tramp’s voice is heard. He sings a ‘nonsense song’—an variation of Je cherche après Titine. His act is a hit, but the Gamin’s criminal past soon puts them on the run again. And so it goes.
Anyway, I managed to schedule this appointment, which was to be an introduction to the ward, a meeting with the recreational therapist there, and a meeting with the volunteer coordinator, and “maybe,” some yoga instruction. Things did not proceed in this manner at all, but that’s ok, because if there is one lesson yoga teaches to its disciples, it’s to not be attached to any expectation or outcome, to be in the present moment.

Tell yourself that you are the one doing the choosing, not the one waiting to be chosen. Girls want boyfriends just as much as you want a girlfriend. There’s no reason why you shouldn’t be able to take control when meeting girls. That’s not to say you should be arrogant; it’s more about having a sense of your own worth.

That’s how men should try to be with their chastity. I agree that it is almost impossible not to see things and to think things that are unchaste – but I am talking about doing something unchaste. Men need to avoid that, at least. The problem is that men don’t realize what they are giving up by being unchaste, because they don’t study these issues to know the costs, the lost capabilities to love unselfishly, or the virtues that give them honor with God. No one tells us. Instead of reading “A Man for All Seasons” or “The Faerie Queene”, we pick our role models off the bottom shelf. The schools are no help at all, many parents are busy, and the church just orders people around without any arguments or evidence.
If I really want to push the envelope I might stick a floral printed dress under a jacket or blazer, wear mixed separates or incorporate some layering and draping. It all gets a bit much sometimes though and I have been known on occasion to go mad and wear suede hareem trousers on a Friday. I mostly express my personal style through my choice of shoes which are usually the most fashion forward high heels I can get away with. Not called Veshoevius for nothing!

All the same, the gang holds a Quinn-focused intervention- a “Quinntervention” for when Barney gets back. Before he arrives, Marshall shares uncomfortable sex stories that can only be about Lily, and then slips up with one that actually isn’t. Unfortunately, when Barney does come, Quinn is there, too.

That babe in the manager who died for all our sins was a remarkable man....a remarkable God and a most remarkable Saviour. I am in awe of such greatness, such goodness and such mercy.
Secondly, animal protein is one of the most expensive choices when it comes to protein, and often comes with other negatives like antibiotic and hormone use, not to mention inhumane growing and slaughtering conditions.
You know how you always hear parents talking about how they finally get to go out on a date without their kids, but then all they end up talking about is the kids? I knew we'd miss Kaylee, and of course we'd think about her and talk about her, but what I didn't realize was the little things during our trip that would bring her to mind. As I unpacked, and throughout our trip, I found things.
For the dressing place 2 jalapeno peppers- roughly chopped with seeds, 1 T chopped ginger, 1 T chopped garlic, 2 T sugar, 4 T gluten free soy sauce (La choy), 4 T lime juice in a food processor and puree until smooth. Then slowly pour in 1 1/2c canola or vegatable oil in a slow, steady stream into the mixture while the processor is running. Fold in 1/4 chopped cilantro and add salt and pepper to taste.
Son House is probably best remembered for being a key musical inspiration to Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson, (the latter connection even led to him being signed by Columbia). I wonder how many people who sight his name have even heard the Paramount and L.O.C. sides? Myself, I hadn't given him a listen in years, my own tastes in such things leaning more towards Leroy Carr, Geechie Wiley & Elvie Thomas (about whom nothing is known), and Charley Patton, but digging out his discs for this posting, I must say, they sure sound good. This music is nearly a century old, so it's quite amazing not just that it survived, but that it is more popular and accessible than it ever was. And that, Pat, is the best I can do for your book review.
The other day on a prayer card, Haley wrote that she wanted a pony in heaven because she will never get one here on earth. We talked about how we will have our own horses in heaven and what we want them to look like. She wants a pink one. I told her that if God wants her to have a pink horse, then He will make one just for her because He loves her so much.

It’s become exceedingly difficult for me to sit through sermons and services that have no academic and/or intellectual basis for being. I am spoiled by having grown up with two exceptionally intelligent parents who also have trouble accepting a worship service that has no semblance of an intelligent thought and process put behind it. I’m also spoiled by having attended two churches in Iowa that prided themselves in an academic and intelligent approach to their services, as well as being open to differing opinions within their respective congregations and open to discussions.

Yet there is a much deeper and more profound irrelevance to the president’s proposals. They are all based on the premise that the government can come up with a few targeted initiatives and select some worthy projects to fund through a federal “infrastructure bank,” and this will somehow press the magic levers that produce economic growth. None of this has any relation to the actual dynamism of a free economy, because Obama does not grasp the source of that dynamism.
A particular favorite is Willa played by Maddie Hasson. An orphan parolee she lives in a trailer on the property and works in the bar, she has managed that perfect yes I magically smell great and look gorgeous but really I slept in this and just throw on my boots in the morning and go. Her chunky braids always sit against her head with ribbons and trinkets imbedded inside – I don’t even know how you would do that. She almost always wears the same pair of jeans, a light washed denim that she cuffs just above her boot tops, and some variety of tank of peasant tees.
And that, it seems, gets to the quiet. That is what I need, to cope with what I saw in Lazzarini’s work.

Okay, maybe not always to that extreme but the point is, Malaysians are obsessed with sambal. It’s brings a spicy touch of savoriness to an otherwise plain and boring plate of food. It elevates the dish, more so than adding ketchup to chips or fries. It makes the dish, period. I think what’s wonderful about it is the sweet-spicy combination of shallots/onions and red finger chillis which are then slowly sautéed to bring out the flavors.
The Genocide Machine is essentially a back to basics Dalek story. The Doctor turns up on an alien world, finds out that Daleks are up to no good and sorts them out. It is inevitable that Big Finish would sooner or later have attempted such a story. The Genocide Machine does what it sets out to do and I think proves to be a fairly enjoyable experience, even though personally I prefer stories that attempt to do a bit more than this.

New Belgium Brewing Inc. 1554 Enlightened Black Ale
The Hatfields and McCoys are replaced here by the Canfields and McKays and as the film opens the feud has been going on long enough that no one really remembers its cause. On a dark and stormy night, John McKay is killed and, in the process, kills his Canfield attacker. Afraid for her infant son, McKay's widow packs him up and moves to New York where, after her death, he's raised by her sister in ignorance of the feud. When he reaches the age of majority, Willie McKay (Buster Keaton), returns to the family home to reclaim the assets of his father's estate (if the run down house left by John McKay can be called an "asset"), and immediately enters the Canfield family crosshairs. He also, during the train journey from New York, falls in love with Virginia Canfield (Natalie Talmadge), who invites him over to her family's house for dinner. On his arrival at the home, Willie learns of the feud, but he also learns that the Canfield code of honor prevents any of the family from killing him so long as he's their guest. The solution, obviously, is for Willie to just never leave the house.

You have your list of “requirements”, he either meets them or he doesn’t. He’s either willing to fulfill your wants and needs, or he’s not. The trick is, you have to be secure enough to allow a man you may think is perfect for you walk away if he does not meet or is not willing to fulfill your requirements. In some cases, you may have to adjust your requirements, but not at the expense of settling.

“Close your mouth, Banks–we are not codfish.”
To the regular audience on here, I hope you’ll indulge a spill-over of the weekend political slot into Monday, but it is a Bank Holiday Monday after all. Last Thursday there was an event to examine the forthcoming Fiscal Compact referendum; the event was organised by the National Forum, which presumably is still Marc Coleman’s lot. The event was held in the Davenport Hotel just down the road from Leinster House and there were four keynote speakers – Declan Ganley of Libertas, Brian Hayes the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Michael McDowell, former Attorney General and leader of the defunct Progressive Democrats and lastly Fianna Fail grandee and until recently, deputy party leader, Eamon O’Cuiv, Deputy O’Cuiv having “resigned” after adopting a nuanced position towards the referendum which was at odds with the majority of the Fianna Fail parliamentary party.
My daughter was diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome a little over a year ago. I suspected it for a long time, and she and I have been learning about it together. That's great for us...now if only I could get other people to understand and work with her In the end, the ultimate result for her is genuine confusion, and lack of understanding about how people can be such jerks. (That was the kind and gentle version of the word I'm actually thinking).

As you can see I have done lots of layering, distressing, sewing & included loads of textures. I would have to say I am a very "tactile" scrapper. The more textures the better. There was just so much I wanted to include in this layout but just couldn't fit it all on. As you can tell I don't do "minimalist". I so enjoy the "journey" as much as the "destination". I admire people that do, but I can't!!!

Dreams and foxes both charm and allude us. They appear in the corner of our eyes, only to vanish the moment we consciously register their presence. Foxes, while they run rampant in folklore and mythology, are difficult to keep on the page—they’d rather be devious! Dreams present the challenge of anchoring the abstract within the concrete. With each prompt I give on Yay Words! it’s my goal to challenge and inspire. I try to select two themes that are a little unusual, complementary, and would make, in my humble opinion, for good poems.

The first reveal was Team Xtina: Chris Mann vs Lindsey Pavao. Last night my favorite performance was Chris Mann. He ripped that song to shreds. Lindsey had a really great performance and it was a little more main stream so that may work in her favor. Either way I am sure these guys are in for a wild ride in the record industry. Christina split the 100 points even between her artists (50/50). With America’s vote the scores changed: Chris -104; Lindsey -96. The first Top 4 contender is Chris Mann. I didn’t expect that at all, but I am happy for him. That was really close. And heartbreaking when Chris and Lindsey embraced and she sobbed into his shoulder.

Golden Autumn:
Once my options ran out, I was one hair short of being done with my illustrious author career. But then I did one last thing on a whim. I sent it to three small publishers: Deseret Book, Covenant and Cedar Fort. All three of them were almost exclusively religion-oriented publishers (Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints a.k.a. LDS Church a.k.a. Mormons a.k.a. Stephenie Meyer's Church). The first two sent me back nice letters saying thanks, like your story, but it's, uh, a fantasy kid's book, take a hike, psyche.
A call was put out quickly (before we lost radio contact) to let the Lost Boys know that we would wait on the Great Alpine Road while they took in the unplanned sights of Wangaratta township.

My sister is a 30-something, single mother who also works fulltime, but, is considered part-time and so she has no benefits.

Both of them have changed quite a bit over the years and so have my parents.
Defense lawyer Robert McAllister immediately zeroed in on the Feds' superstar snitch, Larry Fairfax, noting that Fairfax set the whole thing up to cover up the fact that he, a trusted friend, had taken advantage of that trust by stealing the silver stored at Steele's home. McAllister then rebutted the prosecutor's purported motive by pointing out that when Steele nearly died of a ruptured aorta, Cyndi had split time between taking care of him and her own mother, and noting that they would literally spend 45 minutes at a time each day talking about each other and thrashing out the problems that faced their lives.
Okay, so I will admit that I'm on a bit of a Jasper Fforde bender at the moment and have just last night finished The Fouth Bear.

Related to the issue of Bauckham and Davids understandings of the ‘testament’ genre is the assumption that pseudepigraphal literature was accepted in the early church and could actually be accepted into the canon. It seems that the last 50 years have seen some serious softening up to the idea that ‘pseudepigraphal does not equal forgery’. Cranfield expresses the idea when he writes,

So divorce . . . I think it’s important to stress first that the term ‘divorce’ can refer to a couple of different situations. The most important point to consider in terms of legal history are 1.) who is allowed to request the divorce and 2.) what grounds, if any, are required for divorce to be considered.
Despite being an effed up movie in the fore-front, deep beneath all of that is a character-driven drama that messes with your head about who you should feel sympathy for: the victim or the predator. That line is blurred many times throughout the whole flick as you constantly feel like one person is in the wrong for what they’re doing, but then again, you can’t help but think that this person has a reason for doing what they are doing mainly because of what they know and have against the other person. The film gets terribly uncomfortable when it comes to the decisions of who you think should get the sympathy and what that other person should do. Sometimes, I even felt guilty for sympathizing with the person I felt sympathy for but that’s the way that this flick messes with your mind and makes you think to how you would feel if you met one of these people in your life.

After the cake pops are dry (5-10 minutes), you can put them in decorative little cupcake papers or stand the pops up on a styrofoam block. They also make cute display boxes for them.

So, if Clitoraid began all this several years ago, why the attention now? Clitoraid’s US operation was featured in Newsweek last October, after all. The attention comes now because of a recent press release circulated by Good Vibes announcing their support for the project through donations of vibrators for the very important rehabilitative work that is needed after surgery. That release made the rounds of several feminist sexuality email lists and raised some eyebrows. A bit of investigating raised anger. And that anger will, I hope, create an opportunity for some important discussions. It is worth noting that had it been another sex toy retailer I suspect the explosion of interest would not have happened in the same way. Though Good Vibes does not brand itself as feminist, I think that many of us who love the store for its woman-friendly, nonjudgemental, educationally-oriented space in the sex toy retail wold think of it as feminist. We associate it with the creative, intellectual and activist work of people like Carol Queen as if the two are one entity.

Warrior’s Gate hangs suspended between two universes, a mirror reflecting each back at itself sitting at the threshold. On one side a scientific concept, the play of “Charged Vacuum Emboitments” (and what an odd term, “emboitment.” Wherever might that come from, and what might its significance be? Ah well. Surely the concept won’t come up again, so let’s not worry about it), becomes the occasion for a set of symbols to interact. On the other the symbols and the interactions that stem necessarily from those concepts can be named and treated as a predictable system, at least from within the system. The two views are coextensive.
This is exactly what just happened in France. There were 2 million spoilt ballots in the final round of the election, amounting to more than 5% of the vote. Analysis shows that they were cast disproportionately in areas where the Front National is strong. So these were FN voters sending a message: we don’t want either of the establishment parties; we’re not playing the game any more. As a result, Hollande will now snuggling down in the Elysée palace, working on a bill to grant votes to foreigners.

Also, we need to see Marvel’s Hercules on the big screen. He needs an individual movie, and then be included in The Avengers 2. It won’t happen, though. The Avengers and all of the other current Marvel movies are highly tied to the “Ultimate” Universe of Marvel (which is why we have Sam Jackson as Nick Fury), and in that universe, there is no Hercules. So, if I want to see my favorite Olympian on the big screen, I will have to wait for a movie based on the mythology. Still, it would be cool to see Herc and Thor go at it like they do in the comics.

Well this year it was obviously the Avengers. The preview itself I can’t say was the actual one min thirty sec that it became on the Youtube, but I waited and found it right before me on the computer. And I the better for it. For I was thoroughly unimpressed. I mean *BAM! BOOM!* it looks like it’s going to be one hell of a CGI popcorn funny flick with kick-ass action, but still. For me I could get that with MIP or any Jason Statham movie. That way too it wouldn’t be taking a visual crap on the characters that I hold ever so dear. I believe that I could go and see these films and not have them be the comics and still enjoy them, but I for one do not appreciate the character interpretation or even the story. I mean where have all the kick-ass Avengers chicks gone? Also, might I just add that I was watching the trailer and I had my little brother come up and say “They aren’t very intimidating are they? I mean you get Captain, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow on a team and you should be wetting your pants.” He’s right, you should be, yet this team has yet to prove its mettle. Everyone here knows my dislike of the Captain America portrayal I mean Cap’s supposed to be a force to be reckoned with. He is supposed to be a presence not a down and out aw shucks block from a simpler time. “Mr. Stark.” Oy Vey! Sure not everyone agrees with my interpretation of Cap but come see come saw.

Several years ago, I used to write a paragraph about each child. It took so long to look at all of their assessments, then try to word a sweet, but direct, synopsis 18 different times. I decided there must be a quicker way. So, I created a checklist-style conference form. The skills closely relate to our lengthy report card. All of the "positives" are listed on one side and the "let's work on these" skills are listed on the other. Sometimes, I will put a checkmark on both sides (ex. If a child can count by 1s and 5s but not 10s, I will just circle the 1s and 5s on the "positive side" and then circle the 10s on the "negative side." ) I feel like it's a quick way for parents to see areas of praise and areas of concern.

After she calmed down I gave her a rawhide to chew while I did a few things around the house. I don’t know if it was the anxiety or the bone or both, but Apollo came up to the x-pen barrier and she stared and then lunged at him. He ran away. She couldn’t have gotten to her because of the barrier but I wasn’t happy with that behavior at all since I think that’s what happened the other night because there was a rawhide on the floor in the bedroom when we had that incident the other night.

Our heroes stop the plan and rescue the girl before her nuptials in a duty, cobweb filled wedding party that has been sitting there since the original planned wedding some twenty years prior. There is a particularly disturbing touch to that element which sticks out most in my mind about the episode. I am also bemused by the mention by Jim that the doctor is planning to use his mined element to turn people into robots. I am quite certain there was no concept of robots in the 1870’s. a small gripe, but a ripe nonetheless.

Ken instantly surrendered himself to the Force and let it direct his body. Gripping the Duros’ waist sash with the hand he’d had on the man’s back, Ken simultaneously pulled with all his might, while pivoting on his heel and lashing out with his right hand; the walls of the skyway were doused in brilliant green light as a blade leapt from one end of his weapon. When he leveled his stance, Ken was standing face-to-face with their masked attacker.

Raising the issue on twitter occasionally, I would always stress when I typed “scone”, that it was pronounced “scone” not “scone”, but then it became apparent that some people offered a third mode of pronunciation: “scone”; and some a fourth: “Scone”. Now clearly “Scone” is wrong. Unless you are talking about the place Scone – but why would anyone confuse Scone with scone? Only a blithering idiot would make that mistake.

The IPKat notes that this judgment follows nine days in court spent arguing the toss over damages. That's one day more than the total of eight days spent at trial (six days) and before the Court of Appeal (two days). He can't help wondering if the parties wouldn't have saved themselves a good deal of time and trouble if they'd been able to sort damages out between themselves rather than flying off into the distant galaxies of speculation: now that we are getting so much better at pre-trial case management, perhaps we should give more attention to improving post-trial case management too.

Other critics, for some reason, seem to be picking Kwiecinski's segment, entitled "Fawns," as their pick for best in show in this anthology. Personally, I found this parable of hipsters learning to care for someone other than themselves during an impending apocalypse to be an interminable bore—occasionally striking visually but a complete void as far as human interest goes.

The U.S is ratcheting up a societal-level war on public education. At issue is whether we are going to make it better — build it into something estimable, a social asset that undergirds a noble and prosperous society — or whether we’re going to tear it down so that private investors can get their hands on the almost $1 trillion we spend on it every year. The tear-it-down option is the civilian equivalent of Ben Tre, but on a vastly larger scale and with incomparably greater stakes: we must destroy public education in order to save it. It’s still early in the game, but right now the momentum is with the wreckers because that’s where the money is. Whether they succeed or not will be up to you.
When we finally got on the road without any children in the backseat we breathed a sigh at the sound of quiet. We enjoyed a leisurely drive up to our destination about two hours north of where we live. We stopped for lunch. Got lost a couple times.

Got to the cottage we were renting for the night and enjoyed the peace and quiet.

Spring is one of my favorite times of year: the trees in bloom, the packing away of heavy coats, the longer days, and the arrival of strawberries and asparagus are all cause for celebration. And when I was in school, the season also meant a break—a perfect excuse to hit the road. There was no shortage of places to explore in Texas, but one of our favorite journeys was the annual trek to the Hill Country so we could witness the bluebonnets in full bloom. But as glorious as Texas’ state flower may be, I'd say one of the best parts of the trip was a pit stop made in the tiny town of West.
Yes, Kevin Durant is the greatest scorer in the NBA and LeBron James is probably the best overall player, but does anyone else in the league mean more to their team than Tony Parker? I don’t believe they do as the aging Spurs have a lot of older players on their team that are still capable of putting up big numbers, but not on a consistent basis. With an aging Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobli, Tony Parker has to come to play night in and night out.
Even when Gram and Imma tackle the same genre, their writing styles insure different outcomes. Gram’s take on a short story will differ from Imma’s, even when the general theme is the same. Gram’s detail oriented, logic makes her good at mystery/detective type fictional work. Imma’s creativity lends itself to romance, science fiction, and other creative genres. When writing with the same theme or topic, the approach differs between the two. Gram will often create from the bottom up, making pieces of the writing and bringing them together . Imma, on the other hand will often start with an over-arching concept and figure out the various pieces from there, working top to bottom.

The Movie: We open with a black and white view of a funeral for several people, with two unnamed girls (Marie-Pierre Castel, one half of the delectable Castel twins, and Kuelan Herce) standing silent witness. Later, said girls are sitting around a castle looking bored, and decide to take a trip to one of the towers. There they encounter two dying men, chained up and with stakes in their chests. One of the men warns the girls to take his stake after he has perished, and go put a permanent end to “Them.” However, he warns that the girls only have until nightfall; and adds that should they be too late, they should offer themselves as servants, thereby ensuring their own lives. As it’s not quite ten minutes into the film, you can probably guess how that turns out.

I found a kindred spirit in Jerramy Fine, author of Someday My Prince Will Come: True Adventures of a Wannabe Princess. It’s a memoir telling the story of Jerramy’s life growing up in rural Colorado as the royalty-minded child of hardcore hippie parents. So hardcore-hippie that they named her Jerramy, because it sounded pretty. When she was six years old, she found a book at the library that showed her the members of the British Royal Family. Her eyes fell on the name of Peter Phillips, a grandson of the Queen who was her age, and she knew then and there that she would meet Peter, they’d fall in love, and they’d marry, making her a princess. The book goes on to tell of Jerramy trying to pattern her life after ladies who married into royalty, like Mette-Marit, Crown Princess of Norway and Mary, Crown Princess of Denmark, and how it took her to the London and Oxford social scenes in the hopes of running into her own Prince.
Jose Ramon Castro, 37, New York, N.Y.
So who is dead in the Joseon era? They never showed her face and there’s obviously some massive cover up going on. I would think the Crown Prince would have identified her corpse by her face and not just her clothing but if there’s a twist in this at all, it would be that the Crown Princess murdered her sister out of jealousy and will pretend to be her by wearing the veil and will later make the Prince fall in love with her as she impersonates her sister . Yes, this is a convoluted theory because why not just kill the younger sister and live on as herself? I did say if. Or maybe Crown Prince will return, take off the veil and see what his sister-in-law really looks like but that would mean Park Ha ends up alone. So for the sake of my sanity, they need to make it so that both their doppelgangers are dead so they can be together in whichever era they choose.

(Author’s comment: In recent weeks a truly grassroots movement, Occupy Wall Street, has developed with common people protesting the blatant criminal behavior by corporations, bankers, and their political sycophants. The vast wealth the Wall Street “One Percent” controls has come at the expense of the middle and working class resulting in deteriorating social conditions here in America. Far from embracing this Occupy movement many in the business and political classes have made it a point to question the protesters intelligence and motives. The most shocking is how several of those business pundits (assholes) have stated that to be anti-capitalist is to be anti-American. Excuse the hell out of me but unlike many I have actually read The Constitution of the United States and some bright boy or girl in love with money will have to explain to me where "Capitalism" is enshrined in that document.
In connection with the affairs of Pattisons'. Limited, a telephonic communication received from their Leith office on Saturday afternoon stated the Company paid over £6000 of duty that day, and that business was going on as usual. It was announced in Edinburgh on Saturday that the British Linen Company Bank hold securities over Pattisons', Limited, to the extent of £100,000. Pattisons' granted a bond for a cash credit with a bank of £40,000 in December, 1897, and so late as the 3d of November last they executed another deed conveying additional security to the extent of £60.000 for a further cash credit. The total indebtedness of the Company to the bank on these bonds is thus £100,000. secured over the Duddingston Brewery properties."

But here is the disclaimer: it might not look anything like you expect it to, or like you hoped it would! My husband had expected that our kids would grow up to be academic types, following the traditional university route, but at this point in time, that doesn't seem to be the case. And you know what? It really doesn't matter! The world needs a huge variety of people to make it interesting, and to make it function well.

My teens aren't planning to drive a garbage truck for a living, but you know what? Someone has to have that job, or we're all going to bemoan the day we thought "everyone should go to uni". Of course, we all want our children to be "successful"; but it's helpful to think about what success really means!

When I'm painting, I tend to have one of two things on to keep me company and/or inspire me during the process: music or movies (I include TV shows on DVD), and, more often than not, they don't have any direct connection to what I'm painting. Most of the time I can't remember what I was listening to or watching while painting, but sometimes a memory will become so ingrained that, even a dozen years later, I can still remember that I was watching my DVDs of The X-Files while painting this picture. I can't remember the specific episodes, but it would have been shows during season 1 or 2, and looking at the green of the roof trim brings it all back.

“And the power of the Lord was present to heal…” (TLB) “And the Lord’s healing power was upon him.” The word “power” refers to the full dimension of God’s power…all of it… It was there to heal the people… Ephesians 2:19-20 tells us that the same power that raised Christ up from the dead is working on behalf of people both in and out of the church. The Lord could have said, “Look at the universe…See my power… it upholds them all…But Jesus didn’t… He used an example that relates to us… The resurrection power can make you alive… (Romans 8:11) The resurrection power conquered sin, sickness and the devil.

Also, the Party finances have to be sorted out now, once and for all. Public perception is the big issue here. The employment of any individual on a six figure salary is wholly unacceptable. You could get at least 3 good people for this figure! It would be bad enough if this salary were being funded from investments, but no, this money is coming directly from donations- and as we all know, the Party gets its money from supporters who are either elderly or working class. No rich bankers or businessmen are forking out to help the BNP, I’m afraid. So although donations might well be up as a direct result of an individual’s efforts which on the face of it might be said to justify this level of remuneration, the salary is coming directly from our supporters and unfortunately there has been proven to be such a thing as ‘donation fatigue.’ Once we lose the memberships goodwill, the income flow will dry up and it will be very hard, if not impossible to restore it.

More about that later on.

Certainly with all the good that comes from this show it would be hard to find something bad. Well I don’t want to be a barrier of bad news but there are somethings about the show that are disturbing. Probably the greatest problem with the show is the pseudo belief that our identity comes from how big or how fit we are. Each week as I watched and even celebrated with people who lost their weight I also was disturbed by how much their identity was tied up in their size. Their was talk about being made new or I will never be the same, or I got my life back. I understand many of these statements and have even caught myself saying them from time to time as I lost my weight. But the reality is that losing weight or gaining it does not make a person new. Our identity and how we see ourselves must not come from the World’s standards but from Gods. We are a new creation no matter what our size if we give our lives to Christ. Sadly losing weight does not change the real person. Certainly we can feel better about ourselves but if their is no change in our hearts than we are still the same people.

Richardson is charged in five narcotics conspiracies, five substantive counts of possession with the intent to distribute narcotics, and two counts of offering bribes to public officials. If convicted, Richardson faces mandatory minimum sentences of at least 10 years, and he potentially faces life without parole in federal prison. Each bribery count also carries a statutory maximum penalty of 15 years in prison.
This behavior went on for at least two years, in part because many were hesitant to call her out. After all, she supposedly had a glowing reputation and a lot of endorsements. Some had met her in person: in other words, this wasn't some perv-dude in his mom's basement, or even somebody's sister in male drag a la JT LeRoy. And she appeared to have a lot going on in her personal life: unemployment, a sick pet, relatives in distress. Most of all, she just seemed so nice!

I'm reminded now of my all-time favorite quote from Abraham-Hicks: "My happiness depends upon me, so you're off the hook!" I love that quote and I know in my soul that it's true. I am in charge of my own happiness. I get to choose. I choose to appreciate this contrast (the break-up that I don't want) and use this situation to align with my inner being and have the best year yet!
When I was young, I had very fine, very curly hair. The hairdresser our family used decreed that my hair must always be short. For nearly 10 years I had exactly the same hairstyle – very short and curly. I loathed it. At fourteen, I finally put my foot down and didn’t have my hair cut for 3 years. The end result was that I had something that resembled a large, fluffy shrub on my head, g0ing upwards and outwards by the same amount. I vowed at fourteen that I would NEVER insist on a particular hairstyle for my children and that they could choose their own styles. I’ve maintained this with the older children, with the proviso that whatever style they have, they must take care of their hair (or allow us to do so). So, a haircut like Puck’s? A large gulp, followed by a “Sure thing.” Conal was very happy.
i know i am behind in my updates! Sorry! i will get to them soon but i just wanted to warn everyone that we might be offline for a few weeks cos we don't think we will have internet access at Litchfield. We will bring the computer in to town with us when we come so will get emails eventually but we might be slow in replying.
I currently have a contract with _____ Literary Agency. I am writing you because I wish to find new representation for my novel, Love and Navy Slippers, due to the unsatisfactory representation I have received so far.
Bit of a sad day here in Defying Gravity land. A family member has passed away. Pinkie, the albino guinea pig we've had since her birth died yesterday. Sniff. Well actually, great big sobs.
When I picked up the box at the PO, I quickly glanced at the holes and only saw yellow… . “Hmmm, the inner voice piped up. Where are the little black balls of fuzz?” I put the box on the pickup seat, and tore open the packing slip, the invoice correlated with my order of meat birds and pullets, so I headed over to my friend’s house to divvy up the goods.
The fact that I waited so long only adds to it and I am glad. This movie was nothing short of a dream, as I suppose all good ones should be. Vivid in detail ,dynamic in how they take your breath away and wise in how they show you that you were the integral …… and much like an immersive dream ,good or bad ,taking you near the edge of the childhood stunt that turns iron bed stands brown .

Troubled soul don't lose your heart
I went back to the house yearning to correct this act of stupidity. I was obviously in a tetchy mood, so I grabbed my English journal, and I impatiently wrote down the date.Then, another thing hit me. The most important question came to my mind. I felt like one of those cartoons with a lightbulb on her head filled with much enlightenment.Torpor left my being, and everything seemed so clear. This question is the turning point of my experience. This question is the thing that I should have thought about a long time ago. This question is the core of every piece of writing. This question states the basic concept of writing–What will I write about?
About three quarters of the way through the school year I got a kidney infection that kept me out of school for a good couple of weeks. When I returned to school and the Choir room for the Varsity Class, I promptly and quietly found my chair and waited for class to begin, just as I always did. The choir director, Mr. Flikkert fixed his eyes on mine, noticing I was in class. Without saying a word, he turned on his heels and grabbed some sheet music from his desk on the other side of the room. You see, the first song was kind of a big deal and we all wanted our favorite. It was kind of a warm up of sorts. Everybody in class automatically stopped chatting and we all settled in and waited to see what the first number was going to be while he took his customary place behind the piano. Mr. Flikkert said, he had noticed a returning student back with us after an absence that was much too long due to an illness. I looked around the choir room and wondered who he was talking about. Who did I have this in common with? Then he went so far as to utter my Name, right out loud! I wasn’t accustomed to this kind of attention! He said the class had agreed this would be the first song we would sing upon my return.

One part of the book I will never forget is this, the section on gun safety:
"I have a sense of these buried lives striving to come through me to express themselves."
We were so unlucky not to be 3-0 up on half time as Cole directed a cross to the bottom right corner, only for Marshall to pull off a superb save to keep the welsh side in the tie.The threat from Cardiff grew slightly in the second half but to be honest I thought we were actually reasonably comfortable and always looked like scoring on the counter, and we really should of as a ball was fired in from the left only for Nolan to head wide from a few yards out, and our captain really should have done better.

When investigating this project initially I challenged Richard Moorman over the figures he produced in Enniskillen.. It probably didn’t go down too well with the audience who seemed more interested in giving him a ‘verbal’ kicking if you understand…
So far, so good.
The script is atrocious, even by 80s' slasher standards. People say things like "he was the victim of another Santa murder" and ask "are you any nearer to solving these Santa Claus crimes?" with a straight face. "What possible reason could I have for killing Santas?" asks a suspect. "My father's just been murdered. I can't concentrate," says one poor girl. Indeed not, and especially with that horrible music going on in the background. The acting is just as bad, either stilted or a bad Roger Moore impression.
Walking along this long remaining part of the Berlin Wall is a very special feeling between the beautiful colored artworks and the cold, threatening present of the Wall and its meaning. To give you a better impression of the Berlin Wall and the significance of the fall in 1989, here a short video about the fall of the Wall:
The sky started to darken to a deep indigo. Crickets began chirping. The heat from the day was gone and a cool wind rustled the leaves in the trees. The hills to the west were outlined with gold as the sun dropped below them.

So... to those who have been there and done that or are in the thick of this with me... anything you'd add to my list?
Another false dichotomy. Jesus puts evangelism and discipleship together in the Great Commission (Mt. 28:18-20). In fact, you could say that you can’t have one without the other, because a true disciple will evangelize and a true evangelist will want to see, not merely converts, but followers of Jesus. Noble points this out in the paragraph but seems to say many churches are ignoring it. I for one have never heard a church say anything like what Noble says at the beginning of this paragraph. Most churches want to reach out. Many find it difficult. That a church finds it challenging to reach people is not the same as giving “the rest of the world the middle finger.” There may be a variety of reasons why some churches prosper in reaching people and others are less prosperous. But a focus on discipleship is not one of them. In fact, where people are truly being discipled, where true spiritual growth is happening, there will consistently be a greater passion for evangelism.

So folks, give me your examples of inconsiderate America and I’ll keep posting mine. Let’s see if we can’t embarrass America into being more considerate, if not, I may have to resort to carrying an airhorn to movie theaters.
While we may not see it in prose for some time, modular storytelling is finding its way into film. Thanks to Daniel Knauf (creator of HBO’s Carnivale), modular storytelling has debuted on the web in a big way. Tomorrow I will give my initial thoughts on Haunted.

Most of our painting is just done at a nature station that one or two children are rotating around. This lasts only 15 minutes a day. In the afternoons, when I can, I get out the paints and usually a handful of kids come and join me. It is optional and just for fun. Also, I like to paint with the little girls as part of their school. They love it, but again, the time period is short. We paint something like an apple on the table, or a bird from a bird book.
Tom jumped out of his seat, “Yea no, of course. I uh… need shoes…” he wasn’t sure what he was saying, or doing for that matter. He managed to find his shoes, and his wallet, and the door. He ran down to be met with a grinning John at the front door. John had dumped his sister, but he would never dump Tom. No matter what happened he always came back for Tom. He was worth more to John than his sister was. John actually cared.

Xu Guan broke open the action of the shotgun and reloaded. This time, like the previous time, he pulled two translucent white shells from his pocket and slipped them into the dual chambers of the gun. With the action closed, Xu Guan reached into his pocket again to take inventory of his ammunition.

But on to this week's exercise, which is to choose a piece of writing for a previous W.o.W prompt and re-work it, taking on the suggestions of those who read it and applying new skills learnt, in an attempt to make it better.
I didn't sell anything that day ha! But the free cards did find their way into handbags & pockets. A view days later i heard that i was allowed to be a participant again this year. But only with my drawings not my paintings. (whats wrong with my paintings? Kids loved my fertility godess, it made them laugh and me too. But parents draw them quickly away from all those tits lol) And without the clothesline. Another ha! Guess what? I'll do it! What can i say. I am a masochist. I am a stranger, a steppenwolf. I am vulnerable. ~SMILE~

I have gotten Aces 36 times, I have lost 3 times with them. One time I got called by a J8 suited heads up. The person was short stacked. They caught trip 8′s. The second time I lost I failed to raise it up enough pre-flop. I doubt it would have mattered though. I was up against Q10 of diamonds, unfortunately I went all in after the flop when a Q105 had flopped. Didn’t catch another pair.

You know those hours you spent working instead of at the lake with friends? Well, those could pay off, unless you did them just for the sake of having an internship. Take more from your internships than a line on the resume. They can teach you a lot about how to work with others in a professional setting and how to meet deadlines.

Nicole says she thought about filing a restraining order right away, but didn't. She didn't sleep well that night, or the whole week for that matter. She had a male co-worker meet her in the parking lot every morning before work, and every night he walked her to her car. "I didn't go anywhere without someone by my side, and had to have my sister take me to the grocery store."
What time is the next train? What’s the problem, sir?
So leading on from my pondering over cloudiness in the last post here's some examples and explorations...
Do – look for a chapel, not to pray, to sleep. The chapel was the only place in my terminal that had chairs with no armrests. It also had a door that closed, was warm, and didn’t play the annoying security update message over and over again. When I got to the chapel I was the only one there, but by the time I woke up there were five of us in there. Which leads me to my next point….
Penal substitution is not in view. To place that metaphor over this text leaves it misshapen, and clarity is lost as the wrong colours and hues are being seen. The next post will use the shapes and colours of the Yom Kippur festival and place them within the bigger picture of Jesus, the crucifixion, and the resurrection.

The only other thing to report on the way down is that I caught a Silversword blooming. I can’t say I found the plant particularly beautiful but it is special to see one as it flowers. Haleakala is the only place in the world you’ll find them. They can live up to 50 years and they only flower one time. The stalk can reach up to 2 meters high, and once it’s done, the plant dies: one of those both profoundly sad yet beautiful decisions of evolution that you occasionally find in nature.
We usually stay and have a Sunday lunch in the restaurant but yesterday we came home because I had left a nice fat herb-fed free range chicken cooking slowly in the Aga. It was delicious.

The withdrawal effects of having no coffee over a few days for us addicts is nothing short of brutal either. I have never had a migraine in my life, that is, until I went my first 24 hours without one of my double shot coffees since being hooked. The migraine was constant and unaffected by pain killers for two days but disappeared in 15 minutes when I finally realised that’s the coffee was the cause.

ZBOW has been stuck having to keep people believing there’s a chance he doesn’t go for Swimsuit Issues, but Ben is a man of integrity and true grit, therefore he leaves us subtle clues we can fall back on when he stomps on some hearts (which is why I watch the show). In this case, he said there are “moments” when he could see himself ending up with Lindzi. Let’s clarify. There were moments I thought I could picture myself farting in a crowded room of local business leaders. There were moments I could picture myself possessing the ability to fly and eat thunderclouds.
So to me, unschooling is basically putting anarchy into practice in daily life. It's going past the philosophy and the can-it-really-work and proving that people, *even* children, are far more capable of controlling their own lives than anyone gives them (us) credit for.

There is a technical reason for the ugly flatness as well. No building in DC is allowed to be taller then the Washington Monument. Because the city planners were worried that their dick building wasn’t big enough, the rest of the city is required to be flat. That’s like telling your girlfriend she has to get a breast reduction and maybe cut her hands and feet off so your small dick is the biggest thing between them. She goes along with it anyway, but then she never shaves – and that’s where all the turning circles and squares come from.

There is a developing philosophy that as one gets older he has served society and now it owes him a decent retirement. If anyone could claim that it would be Paul but as long as God gives life and breath He still has a task to be done.
