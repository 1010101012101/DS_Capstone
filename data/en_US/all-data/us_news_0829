He can be impressively forceful when challenged directly to defend his wealth ("If people think there's something wrong with being successful in America," he said after an offhand reference to his wife's two Cadillacs triggered the predictable backlash of blue-collar indignation last weekend, "they better vote for the other guy"), but he tends to avoid references to his own success, betraying his high caste only in thoughtless lapses (see NASCAR team owners and $10,000 wagers).

He'd been invited to speak in recognition of Patagonia's longtime commitment to environmental issues and its reputation as a company that manages to churn out profit while minimizing ecological impact.

Kasich also intends to charge oil and gas companies $25,000 for every well they drill, money that would go to local governments to help with road and other repairs that will be needed if the industry drills 1,000 new wells per year as the state is assuming.

HEAT CRAMPS: Heat cramps are muscular pains and spasms, usually in the leg or stomach muscles, resulting from heavy exertion during extreme heat. Heat cramps usually occur when the heat index is between 90 and 105 degrees. Although heat cramps are the least severe of all heat-related health problems, they are often the first signal that the body is having trouble coping with the heat and should be treated immediately with rest and fluids. Stretching, gentle massaging of the spasms, or direct, firm pressure on cramps can reduce pain. Seek medical attention if pain is severe or nausea occurs.

The Halliburton House was built on a South Laguna hillside in 1937 by Halliburton, a famous adventurer and writer. It was designed by William Alexander Levy, who had worked for Frank Lloyd Wright. He built it of concrete, steel and glass block – materials international modernists were experimenting with.

Specifically, the project was a series of brochures for military personnel, and I was told they had to be written to a fifth-grade level. But how do you define that? Are we talking about an Atlanta fifth grade with cheating teachers and false test scores, or my fifth grade where we learned the difference between 'stationary" and 'stationery"? (Don't ask why I remember that particular lesson. Let's just say it involved an embarrassed teacher.)

If there is one consistent aspect in the storied "Ninja Gaiden" series (going all the way back to the NES) it's a high degree of difficulty. "Ninja Gaiden 3" finds entirely new ways to make you feel inferior, with harder enemies and more gruesome katana sword attacks.

But you can't help wondering if Vick is playing on borrowed time given the heavy punishment he's absorbing. While his extended loss wouldn't necessarily cause an offensive tailspin like that experienced by the Peyton Manning-less Colts, those counting on DeSean Jackson and Jeremy Maclin must be concerned. Whether the underachieving Vince Young or the inexperienced Mike Kafka takes over, the Eagles' wide-open offense wouldn't be nearly as explosive. Opposing defenses would shift their attention squarely on budding superstar LeSean McCoy, who might find his running lanes much more clogged.

The ghostly tree trunks at Lava Tree State Monument near Pahoa also testify to the power of lava. The 17-acre park off Highway 132 features a .7-mile loop trail past tall molds of the 'ohi'a trees that were engulfed in lava in the late 18th century; by the time the trunks stopped burning, the lava surrounding them had cooled, leaving these strange shapes behind.

And deserves to stay there for the rest of his life.

--1B Bryan LaHair hit the first grand slam of his career in the third inning. He picked on a first pitch from the Cardinals' Adam Wainwright and sent a high drive to the opposite field in left-center. It was LaHair's second home run of the season.

Three Wishes Cabernet Sauvignon, California ($2.99, 12.5 percent alcohol): Cabernet's palate was defined for years by the famous Bordeaux wines and had become a giant juicy monster with alcohol levels pushing 14.5 percent.

Mark Ingram, RB, Saints: The table is set for no rookie like the reigning Heisman Trophy winner. Ingram is a battering ram with outstanding vision and sure hands, and what he lacks in speed he makes up for in tackle-busting ability. He should become an instant starter and goal-line beast in New Orleans' high-octane offense. The oft-injured Pierre Thomas is coming off ankle surgery and is unlikely to impede the rookie's path to stardom.
I tried my best to explain this to the check-in agent; however, she was adamant in not allowing me to transit through London. This was a Catch-22 situation for me - I could not go to India without my visa stamped in my passport, and I could not get my visa stamped unless I visited the consulate in India.

To a modern eye, her books reflect many of the faults of her generation — "And Then There Were None" was originally titled "Ten Little Niggers" (which was also the original title of the poem changed to the only slightly better "Ten Little Indians"), and the British class system, still very much in place when Christie grew up, is often replicated in her books without question or argument. That said, there were no sacred cows — her murders were as socially diverse as her victims, and Poirot's greatest asset was that, as a foreigner, no one thought him important enough to guard against. Through him and his less-than-perceptive British foil, Hastings, Christie was able to dissect the famous British reserve and rigid dictates of class. The running joke that no one seemed capable of believing that, although he spoke French, Poirot was in fact Belgian, served as a perpetual admonishment against Britain's often dismissive relationship with its European neighbors.
DOJ officials told a lawyer for Arpaio on April 3 that the lawman's refusal of a court-appointed monitor was a deal-breaker that would end settlement negotiations and result in a federal lawsuit.

Michigan player who must be locked down: PG Trey Burke (14.8 ppg, 4.6 apg) has become the key to just about everything Michigan does in Beilein's intricate offense. He plays a whopping 36.0 minutes a game, which is a lot for anyone, much less a freshman point guard. Burke is a Columbus native who surely would like to have some instate bragging rights.
Blum was not injured on the play, and no penalty was assessed. But NHL disciplinarian Colin Campbell said it is "unacceptable" for a player to use his skate in such a manner.

Fans were livid after the ho-hum March 18 race at Bristol, where the crowd was a fraction of what it used to be and the customers were vocal that the racin' just ain't what it used to be in Thunder Valley.

The girls decided to stick with their plan, and spent hundreds of afterschool hours designing, building and programming their robot. They won their local qualifying tournament, but as expected saw designs emerge that took advantage of that unlimited scoring. The girls could score bowling balls, racquet balls, and even racquet balls with magnets hidden inside them, but their lift could only reach four feet, and it was clear that their approach would never catch up to the single-purpose robots they would increasingly see moving forward. However, they decided to stay with their design, an elegant and beautiful engineering achievement, and instead refine it for a couple more feet of height. Replicon worked on concepts and mockups while Chippindale spent an entire week modeling the new design in CAD (Computer Aided Design). An animation of the design proved that the design was ready, at least theoretically, so hundreds of new parts were ordered and the girls spent five weeks precision machining their new lift just in time for the Northern California championships.
Voters will have to decide whether to stick with an incumbent president whose vision for the country revolves around the re-distribution of wealth and an ever-expanding government, Romney said, "where the only people who do well are the ones who are doing the taking and the giving, in government."

The printed menu hasn't changed much in 20 years. It goes without saying that the oysters are good, and you can get a mixed platter with a dozen on the half shell, eight steamed clams and four chilled prawns ($29.95); however, I always head for the seafood salads. This is where Anchor really shines.

Garcia said he's cracking down on his supervisors so they know where their people are during the day.
James: Definitely not. I think people just look at our offense because it's all flashy and it's smooth, but it really is aggressive too. I do a lot of running up the middle, I take a lot of shots, and I break a lot of tackles. I do a lot of different things that nobody seems to take note of unless they really know football. I think it's just the perception of Oregon football - we have nice, colorful uniforms and nice shoes.

In the documentary, producer Phil Spector says he was stunned to find Harrison had hundreds of unreleased tracks when the two began working on All Things Must Pass. And, perfectionist that he was, Harrison left behind alternate versions of countless songs.

Perhaps it’s the journalist in me, but I tend to see both sides of most situations, including many of the issues mentioned above. So, I tend to over-research and over-analyze even the simplest of decisions, resulting in guilt, worry and sleepless nights. I listen to the opinions of family, friends, doctors and peers. Then there are the well-intentioned strangers (particularly at the grocery store, for some reason) dispensing their words of wisdom. Seems like everybody has an opinion these days.

The cover of Portland's media guide this season features Roy, Greg Oden and LaMarcus Aldridge. And that's a giant 66.7 percent question mark today.

But heres the good news, and heres part of the reason that Im here. I just finished signing a Strategic Partnership Agreement with Afghanistan that signals the transition in which we are going to be turning over responsibility for Afghan security to the Afghans. We're not going to do it overnight. We're not going to do it irresponsibly. We're going to make sure that the gains, the hard-fought gains that have been made are preserved. But the reason we're able to do that is because of you. The reason that the Afghans have an opportunity for a new tomorrow is because of you. And the reason America is safe is because of you.

Mr. Folman's film, "Waltz With Bashir," deals with elusive issues of dissociation, repressed memories and survivors' guilt -- in that sense it's a companion piece to "Adam Resurrected" -- by examining an infamous incident in the Lebanon war when Christian Phalangists massacred Palestinian civilians at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps while Israeli soldiers surrounding the camps did nothing to stop them. Remarkably, the film is an animated feature, and the animation technique works brilliantly. (The blue-and-orange images that first fill the screen, a pack of ravening dogs running through the streets of Tel Aviv, are as powerful as any I've ever seen.) In a festival perched between present and past, risk-takers like "Waltz With Bashir" and "Slumdog Millionaire" show where the movies may go in the future.

"We're certainly not asking him to carry us and hopefully he's not trying to do that, but there's no doubt that he's a special type player.

On balance, the Field Operations proposal holds terrific promise for Santa Monica. It is another sign that the city, smaller and more nimble than Los Angeles, is miles ahead of its lumbering neighbor in thinking comprehensively about how mobility, urban design and civic identity are connected. But if there are also faint signs of concession and even whiplash in Corner's design — signs of a landscape architect struggling to be a visionary and a good listener at the same time — can you really blame him?

Shah makes sure Owen's teachers have a supply of safe snacks so he won't be left out of any celebrations.

A "hate crime" is something that's already a crime - such as assault or vandalism or threats of physical violence - that can be shown to have been motivated by racial or religious or other type of group hatred. Punching your neighbor because you personally hate his guts is a crime, but it's not a hate crime; punching your neighbor just because he's white and you hate white people is a hate crime. If convicted of a hate crime, you get time for the crime and extra time for the hate that motivated it.

Ms. Prada, who also likes pressing buttons, initially "was kind of baffled by the idea," says curator Andrew Bolton. He and Harold Koda, the Costume Institute's chief, have cribbed generously from Schiap's autobiography for the dead woman's end of the conversation.

There have been times where Michelle and I have been sitting around the dinner table and we're talking about their friends and their parents and Malia and Sasha, it wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently. It doesn't make sense to them and, frankly, that's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective."

One spouse may be paying to support children of the previous marriage or may want to preserve assets for them. And never mind the other baggage that people bring with them after divorce, whether it's fear of losing their independence or a bitter ex.
